i tried a 100% pure glycerin soap and had a reaction.
up til then i'd been told that she was just "a cranky baby" and that she had a bad "heat rash".
keep your hair very short while using it.
when i wrote the first letter asking about evaporation my face was getting pretty bad, along with my hands, forearms, neck, and legs.
i was thinking of making a paste of zinc oxide and hypoallergenic brownish lipstick for covering the rash but my eczema has subsided so much that i don't even use much zinc oxide anymore.
which still might be true, actually, but it was such a great thing to have him break the 20-pound barrier.
it's so cold, even when i turn my heater down to minimal, it's still very drying indoors.
i use to work in retail and would stock shelves and just the chemicals from the cardboard would make me red and itchy---i don't have e. sue, thanks for the imput on e, allergies and asthma.
recommended to me years ago and they are the only moisturizers i have used for a long period of time that don't irritate my skin (quite soothing actually).
i have renewed energy, do not scratch at night and am not experiencing any itching that i cannot easily resist.
it is good to know there are other parents out there that have a hard time getting there little ones attention to stop itching.
i have noticed that since i have quit taking the nature's biotics caplet, my eczema has gotten worse, so i know that that one is helpful.
this works especially well in public places if said in a slightly louder than normal voice.
earlier in the day yesterday, she saw the chiropractor.
i used to have a dog; now i can't even enter a home that has one without having a full blown reaction.
i use vitamin e oil right after i shower, while my skin is still wet (i just kind of drip dry and let the oil dry with my skin, as towels irritate me).
our insurance does not cover it.
i was born with eczema, came home from the hospital with it.
i used that several times in the past very successfully for psoriasis, which was my bad skin problem growing up.
i ordered the video "alexander, the elephant who can't eat peanuts".
date: 11 feb 1997 12:40:05 from: michael subject: base for steroid cream i used to use a hydrocorozone cream that was in a cold cream type base.
i also wanted to comment on the food allergy issue... for those of you who have kids who are "allergic to everything," or for whom it seems that way.
i've added zinc to my vitamin regimin.
stay in touch - the support is so strong here.
it's like osteopathy without the force.
i use lubriderm as a moisturizer (my doctor's suggestion) and clotriminazole 1% (i got that tip here).
she also tends to scratch more when she is not content i.e. like when she is sleepy but doesn't want to sleep; or if she can't get to where she wants to go.
eventually every time i put the cream on my eczema would burn.
usually this is a place no one can see; it figures that it's bad now when someone will need to concentrate on this area.
eczema is no fun, but otherwise our son is a beautiful, healthy little boy and so full of joy.
my skin, however, is very sensitive to various oils (can't tolerate mineral oil formulations such as eucerin or creams with more than just a little petrolatum)
out in the newsgroups i have several times found people that thought they had "eczema" but really had undiagnosed dermatitis herpetiformis.
through trial and error i've found it best (for me) to take 4000mg (4 x 1000mg capsules) each day.
so i was wondering if anybody uses non detergent to wash clothes.
i will certainly try the pancake recipe.
no cracks, no redness, and complete feeling!date: 3 feb 1997 14:33:32 from: marilyn subject: coffee & homepathic remedies my understanding is that homopathy treats the person, not the disease.
in my experience there is more than one bag balm on the market; the name seems to have become generic, rather than a brand name.
this frees up trapped nerves, blood vessels etc, throughout the body and allows the organs to work properly.
jodi has not had much luck since her return from her chinese herbal treatment in china.
i have long believed that any lubricant that produces a cooling sensation is actually drying the skin (the cool you feel is the water leaving the skin).
i went right back to nursing jodi when the expedition made no difference to her
from: alan subject: denise & evaporation i don't use corticosteroids if i can help it.
desowen lotion my eczema seems to get worse in the spring.
the only thing jodi has benefited from is chinese herbal treatment.
i am very excited about her development and will look into it for my son.
i've just completed a course in it, and my skin is looking a hell of a lot better.
sometimes i think that my eczema is really everyone else's problem nearly as much as it is mine because they have to look at it -- and on your wedding day, it's their tough luck.
and in truth, it was much more effective in stopping the itching than many of the treatments the doctors prescribed.
when i shower i actually feel relief.
my pharmacist says that emulsifying wax contains cetostearyl alcohol and sodium lauryl sulphate (and some purified water).date: 1 feb 1997 09:46:11 from: debbie subject: childhood eczema citrus is a common allergen.
i brushed my hand on the sheets in a department store and couldn't believe the silky smooth feel.
the first time i used it, i got way too much on
once spring has sprung, i'm sure the public will have questions and comments.
but if the scalp is inflamed or has sores and scabs, i need steroids.
i began these products for a week and then again attempted to wean from prednisone.
i was also advised not to breast feed my baby for a week to see if breast milk was the culprit.
i notice that when i wash jodi's hair everyday, her e clears up on her scalp.
the doctors finally said daniel had eczema when he was a few months old and in the last few months we have been seeing an allergist.
the tighter weave makes it feel wonderfully silky.
that, in addition to going to a homeopath (she put her on a daily remedy to boost her immune system to oveercome these allergens on her own) and weekly visits to a chiropractor have made a big improvement!
when i remember the times that i didn't help my sister because her whining and scratching were driving me crazy.
we found zinc + castor oil seems to help a lot for the arms and legs.
i notice that is when she'll start scratching, more like out of desperation and not because she needs to.
now it doesn't take a rocket scientist to at least suspect it.
air pollution linked to skin ailments - study air pollution can rob skin of an important vitamin, aggravating a variety of skin ailments common to people in urban areas, according to a study released tuesday.
i would not be at all surprised if either substance provoked strong allergic reactions too.
even knowing what i know now, though, i might not have done it, then--breastfeeding was terribly painful for me, i was really ready to quit...
when i was a teen, i cleared up and had no problems until about four years ago.
the clear lotion is a mineral and jojoba type oil (with petroleum fraction & something else - sorry i don't have the bottle here) which i am surprised i can tolerate because many people claim mineral oil is no good.
rash then spread down neck and collar area on wrists and hands.
we were trying aveeno for our daughter's flare ups, as a substitute for cortisone, and trying a vegetable based vaseline-like product for a moisture barrier.
debbie (and julia), i haven't really given brian many baby foods yet.
a lot of my co-workers cannot use it either and they don't have eczema.
a few unrelated things: there's a web site where you can "search for the pharmaceutical of interest by first character of name", at http://www.rxmed.com/prescribe.html.
if you don't already have a book like it then i think it's worth reading.
previous to the egyption cotton sheets, i had on some occasions changed sheets 3 times (all 100% cotton).
though, if you are lucky, the condition should clear up as he gets older.
instead of that red, raised skin, he gets welts.
ribomunyl;isoprinosine;biostim shelley - zemaphyte is indeed available in canada through the emergency drug release program.
when we first took him to the allergist his skin was so bad they couldn't test him there.
felt great all through pregnancy, needed no medication or had no complications at all.
maybe medication, though less likely) to help repair stomach, intestinal, liver areas.
emulsifying wax i once asked a pharmacist and he looked it up and decided diprobase and aqueous cream were the same, possibly whipped up to a slightly different consistency.
we eat pretty much all organic foods, and did for a year before conception, along with no drugs or alcohol.
sue - though the viral attack started a month ago, jodi still has a few scattered blister-like rashes broke out on her skin here and there.
now any time i get into bed i enjoy the feel of those sheets.
from watching my babies suffer with the agonies of the infernal itching i have a glimpse of what sufferers undergo.
in the us if you can't get it at a pharmacy, try your local "feed store", look in the yellow pages (phone directory) for an outlet like southern states.
they also did a blood test to test my thyroid.
it upsets me to think that by nursing, i was causing his eczema, but it's probably true.
my skin drinks it quickly and so far has no reaction to it, either immediately or over time.
the doctors finally said daniel had eczema when he was a few months old and in the last few months we have been seeing an allergist.
i started it to help her sleep better while sick with croup a few weeks ago.
i am researching the possibility of asbestos being the problem at the house i live in now.
when i can allow myself to really experience the feelings, i can tell that the comforting sensation of a hand rubbing my back is something i never got enough of as an infant/child.
after investing a million dollars and hours in vitamins, blood tests and every other possible natural cure, i think they are it.
i shower in the morning and then cover with baby oil and pat skin dry.
ointments (in general) don't contain things like polypropylene glycol.
i don't know if they helped but like you i had a problem with high dosage.
yes, i know that my scratching is making things worse.
they will pay $140 for participation.
as sue described her son isaac, who scratches when he is frustrated, i realized that i too learned this habit in infancy and never got over it.
date: 22 feb 1997 03:15:42 from: debi subject: e baby foods i have been fortunate to work with a nutritionist who has provided me with lists of foods to test.
he also prescribed herbs to be brewed for bathing her.
if the distortion is great enough that spectacles will no longer be adequate, the mainstay of treatment is to wear hard contact lenses (they must be hard lenses - i suspect they will want to fit you with a gas permeable hard lens).
that's one reason we have this list -- so we can vent our feelings without offending professionals on whom we must rely.
after years in a zen training center and a major diet change, my sister now has good control over her skin, and she is very articulate about the emotional hurts that her scratching helped keep at bay.
he then tested positive to potatoes and soy, but his last test came up negative.
anyway don't worry about the having to be different yet.
they just need instruction.
daniel's head looks really bad.
i don't know what condition my eczema will be in on the day of the wedding, so that has limited my choices of dress styles (i don't trust my back/arm eczema enough to wear a sleeveless dress with a low back, but then co-workers ask my why i would want to wear a dress with short sleeves in hot weather, etc.).
i believe the milk thistle are a boon, as they help to repair the liver.
eliminated all known allergens, and also several that the dermatologist suggested we stay away from "just in case".
we already suspected an allergy to cow's milk and had been feeding her soy formula.
date: 6 feb 1997 07:02:49 from: karen subject: childhood eczema hi kim, so sorry your son's allergy testing didn't produce more definitive results.
re: wedding dresses and e., in which she mentions turning a lovely shade of bright eczematic red when she went dress shopping.
eventually every time i put the cream on my eczema would burn.
by the way, i was told that the homeopathic medicated pellets thyrodium, graphites, sepia & sulphur are supposed to be good for eczema.
i am now looking for a liquid form of the same type which can be mixed in his food.
this makes them look pretty raw and swollen on top of the normal dry and cracking.
date: 27 feb 1997 23:51:33 from: karen subject: kim/son infections no scientific research, but my daughter's eczema and other allergies are always lots better after a beach trip.
it is "nutrogena t" and we found it at the grocers after seeing an ad on television.
his legs are still a mess, but they're getting better.
the following is a list of your good foods: also, i go to acupuncture 1 x per month.
we started eliminating lots: dairy, wheat, eggs, tomatoes, corn, chocolate, citrus, peanuts.
the first suggested vitamins he will not chew.
she's still way better than before---hasn't gone that far backwards.
i've been told that anyone with eczema/psoriasis ("leaky gut") should avoid the nightshades (tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, peppers of all kind, and paprika) and to avoid foods high in fat (counting whole milk dairy products).
however, she still worries that her wedding was ruined because her mother-in-law used coloring in the wedding cake batter and the inside of the cake was pink and blue instead of mauve and green like she wanted.
i resort to this book when i haven't got the time to think about cooking.
please note, that the vitamin regimen i listed above needs to have vitamin c added to it.
julia doesn't mind it (doesn't hurt) until she's on her side because she's freaked out by strangers, doctors, etc.
i dumped a friend largely because she was so goopy feel-sorry-for-me it made me sick.
it's like junk food, empty calories, you keep eating and eating and you're never full.
i used to take him out last summer at 9:30 or 10 am and keep him right in it for 5 to 10 minutes.
in a nutshell, you collect dust from your home and send it to john hopkins, they will analyze it and tell you what is in your home.
you are right to remember that you don't know how your skin will be that day.
so, about a year ago, we did a while lot of things, which have definitely improved isaac's skin from being very itchy, red, and cracking over a large percentage of his body, to today's cycle of flares and clear-ups on his legs and arms: stopped all antibiotics.
i've found it near the cortisone creams and calamine lotion in the pharmacy, but it doesn't have any steroids or other drugs in it.
we had a lot of luck with a rotation diet.
then we found an m.d. who said to give him a lot more (like 5 tsps) per day.
it's manufactured by bayer, germany and free of polypropylene glycol.
i washed his face gently and put some antibiotic cream (neosporin) on it.
this is just as effective as the steroid.
so he drinks rice milk (on his rice day, which is every other day now), fortified with calcium.
terfenadine may increase the sedative effect of antidepressants, sleeping pills and antipsychotics, whilst antidepressants increase the chance of abnormal heart rhythms.
i tried it on a hunch after having dealt with all the useless salves and ointments the md had prescribed.
headaches, drowsiness and dizziness are rarer, as are palpitations and fainting.
as i understand it, this isn't technically an "allergy"--that word is saved for reactions that involve his immune system.
it may also be worth noting that the cod liver oil (a & d), as well as the vitamin e are essential.
i will try to answer your questions as best as possible but understand that i am only relaying what i remember from my experiences & from the information given to me from my doctors.
but i still use the oils, i just don't get dressed right away (aren't you glad you're not in my house in the morning).
these do not then get red and angry--they just disappear.
said she was really, really tight in the shoulder blade area, also has said she is making incredible progress--except for one session where he said she went downhill a bit.
you feel light touch only.
i've had a look at http://www.fda.gov and found nothing on it, but that may be because i didn't know where to look and the search engine didn't work.
he prescribed desowen lotion .05%.
if you can clear up the itching problem, 90% of the condition is solved.
our pediatrician (who doesn't believe in this stuff, but had looked it up for another patient)
being part of the care-taking doesn't seem to appeal to her anymore.
their prices are probably not what you'd find at the local wal-mart, but they're not outrageous, either.
pick a time when there are no other distractions and he can give you his full attention.
after 40 years, the habit is so ingrained it is automatic.
i take baths every day.
in the last few weeks, his skin has been blotchy, but the blotches are not usually raised--they're splashes of color.
we are trying to help him as best we can right now, but i also believe in prayer.
it's great stuff though, at least from my observations.
it's a pain to change his diapers, though--have to take his shoes off each time.
my experience has been that anything "strong" was too strong.
date: 13 feb 1997 15:30:57 from: karen subject: glycerin i have always suspected that glycerin may give the illusion of lubricating the skin while it is in fact drying it out.
it seems like the eczema is always worse under my jog bra.
i know that they love me and want to see me well, but i don't want them to bring it up.
did i tell you that i also broke down when julia was sick with croup 2 weeks ago, and took her to a derm.
it looked alot nicer and that was before we learned of his food allergies.
my friend rubbed my back yesterday and that was wonderful.
apparently, the causal relationship between the two (spine & stomach) can go either way: stomach damage can short circuit the spine or a misalignment can mess up the stomach.
the following week lets talk about ointments, creams, external aids.
i don't know if i will do it because i'm nervous about giving myself injections, but i'll think about it.
i think that, in general, with most chronic problems, modern western medicine seems to do just this.
i am already on an extensive vitamin/mineral program, but wondered if anyone had strong feelings about or experience with the glandulars.
we've also been doing the chiropractor for 3 weeks now (twice a week) with great success.
i have renewed energy, do not scratch at night and am not experiencing any itching that i cannot easily resist.
ultimately, he has managed to lose much of the weight (and she's quite proud of him for it!), but it had nothing to do with her harassment and everything to do with finding a way to do it that he could live with.
i think the leaky guy syndrome is one example of a cause--if substances are leaking into the wrong body cavities and causing problems, then the body will manifest this problem with eczema, maybe.
as we all know everyone is different; unfortunately no one thing will help us all.
the picture of jodi on the floor, scratching rather than yelling for help, is a replica of what isaac used to do.
so now i want to push onto maybe a vegie oil.
my allergy book ("allergies made simple" by phylis austin, agatha thrash, md, calvin thrash, md). lists even things like cough syrup, aspirin, envelopes, stickers, gum, candy, salt, paper cups, vinegar..and some toothpastes.
their prices are probably not what you'd find at the local wal-mart, but they're not outrageous, either.
i really do believe the drugs just suppress the immune system and i want her immune system to find its on way to heal itself, so i don't want to overuse them.
if i don't bathe everyday my skin feels horrible.
i'm trying to use different lotions, creams, cortisones, in the morning and night.
i have been taking my son's lunch to daycare for over a year (he is 2.5) and since he never has eaten what other kids do he doesn't seem to care.
perhaps the next allergy testing session will produce some answers.
they carry many egyptian cotton things, and i think sheets are on that list.
all were bought at a chemist or pharmacy.
they come in dark colors and prints that hide stains from scratching and weeping.
again, it's only available by prescription through the emergency drug release program.
sue also mentioned something that she had done with isaac (and i note many of the other parents on here are doing), where she breaks him away from scratching, but in a loving, helpful way.
however, i use them occasionally now that she goes a week at a time with no new breakouts, etc.
jodi has had no blows to her head or trauma to her spine; couldn't think of anything that could cause any neurotoxin or any malnutrition.
also, lycopodium has been successful for me.
the timing was interesting because we had talked to an old-time pharmacist who swore by tar shampoo for cradle cap for his children (now grown) but said he couldn't remember the last time he had some in the store.
from: donna subject: colloidal oatmeal a colloidal 'solution' is not a solution in the true sense, as the particles are in fact suspended in the liquid, and not dissolved -- but the particles are so tiny that it seems to dissolve.
be careful that he does not scratch any particular places on his body regularly though.
kids are smart--they'll find all kinds of ways to substitute for what they know they need, but aren't getting.
around that time, i ran into a product that involved a conbination of multivitamin, cheleated minerals, a variety of antioxidants and proanthocyanidins (in the class of bioflavanols.
it was difficult to stop so suddenly, although i was down to feeding him only 2 or 3 times a day since i work full-time.
many plants, trees, dust and molds had catastrophic reactions.
but i tend not to like the sun much anyway, as i burn so easily.
my preference is only because the cream is a little less "messier".
oddly enough he has no problem with milk and that is usually a big one.
our first naturopath recommended that we give isaac pancreatic enzymes.
i guess it's a good thing he was used to having a bottle.
he's the author that speaks about leaky gut... and says along with it there seems to be a little trouble with elimination (recommends enemas or high colonics on a fairly regular basis) and talks about specific spinal misalignments (different ones for psoriasis vs. eczema) and specific recommendations for diet and supplements and topical agents.
before this though we hadn't used cortisone or benadryl since aug. (tried 2 homeopathic remedies instead, one she's still on).
date: 11 feb 1997 14:25:37 from: royce subject: polypropylene glycol i also thought that polypropylene glycol was not used in ointments but my dr. was going through all his little sample boxes and found that every one of them contained that ingredient.
so, you've already been down the path that we might need to walk.
can't use the antihistamines for 2 days before or the 2 days during, no baths or showers during...
as i understand it, this isn't technically an "allergy"--that word is saved for reactions that involve his immune system.
i've been avoiding visiting anyone with a dog for 3 weeks now and these are the 3 weeks she's been clear.
the derm told me to see how he is after one week off breastmilk, and if it's not better, he would need to have allergy tests done.
my son's face is healed up but with some scars, the dr. says it may go away if given enough time, i hope this is true and doesn't take too long.
it's manufactured by bayer, germany and free of polypropylene glycol.

the only soap she could use was glycerin, clear, unscented.
they usually dry up and go away in 2-3 days.
the guy has a great reputation, and isaac's skin has definitely improved while in his care, but we've also done all these other things at the same time.
my dermatologist doesn't think that my e. is allergy-related, but i do know that textile manufacturers treat fabrics with a number of chemicals, including formaldehyde, which probably don't do much for us e. sufferers!
she stayed clear most of the time, and except for one incident of an asthma-like reaction after exposure to dust (from a herd of goats), she has had few allergic reactions.
i was wondering if you had been prescribed it for the eczema, as one theory is that we have an overactive immune system.
it's a simple, off the shoulder short sleeve dress and i am praying that my skin is clear for the big day.
date: 11 feb 1997 14:19:00 from: alex subject: glycine/glycerine if you are allergic to *glycine*, there's not anything you can do about it, since it is one of the amino acids that your body uses to make proteins.
so he drinks rice milk (on his rice day, which is every other day now), fortified with calcium.
i tried 2 manual once, couldn't stand them.
it was my husband and i who pursued seeing an allergist and seeing if anything was actually causing it or at least making it worse than it really had to be.
if you are allergic to *glycine*, there's not anything you can do about it, since it is one of the amino acids that your body uses to make proteins.
i have found this to be very helpful in my case.
i know doctors can sometimes be pretty blithe about their recommendations, not thinking through the whole picture and just concentrating on fixing the portion of the problem you've presented them with...
pure aloe vera with the vegelatum ointment is working well on her legs.
thompson pharmaceuticals. 1.0% hydrocortizone, benzyl alcohol, propylene glycol, purified water, sd alcohol 40-2 (60% v/v).
on the first visit he said she was extremely tight in the area of the spine that corresponds with stomach and liver.
she was breast fed till 7 months.
the two jodi likes the most are light green and dark green.
it has that healthy barnyard smell.
everybody i know who's gotten married has worried about their wedding being ruined by something.
they also carry natural (unbleached, undyed) cotton sheets & blankets, even a cotton-stuffed pillow (no down).
emulsifying wax if emulsifying wax contains "cetostearyl alcohol and sodium lauryl sulphate (and some purified water)", then this makes aqueous cream sound almost *exactly* like diprobase!
i'm in the middle of a bad outbreak, my antihistamines have mysteriously stopped working (second type that this has happened with), and i need a good night's sleep.
daniel's skin was better during the summer.
i would be afraid that a baby might chew off the polish.
of course i monitored my diet carefully and watched katie for any reaction.
when i got eczema on my scalp it was weeping so the dermatologist gave me some prescription medication that was a steroid concoction suspended in alcohol.
since i started emphasizing the antibacterials, i am less itchy.
from many nights trying to lull bonnie into a state of deep relaxation, and teaching her to use positive imagery to overcome her impulse to scratch, i have a real sense of the helplessness and fear parents of children with eczema undergo.
at the time, i would have done whatever the dr said.
also, i've had some luck soaking in a tub with dead sea salts and some type of oil or aveno oatmeal product (i know aveno doesn't agree with everyone but the gentle bath/shower cleanser, which i use everyday in place of regular soap & the oatmeal work for me.)
the rest of his body is totally free of eczema now (big hooray with lac-hydrin 5), but his scalp is a mess of dandruff.
i stay on here because all the info is so interesting and because i know sooner or later, i'll have a flare-up again, which will be caused by stress.
she is avoiding soy, dairy, sweets including fruits and juices, she drinks rice milk, has a rice/oat/barley cereal mix in the am.
we used to get concerned these food "sensitivities," but we've gotten so used to them that we don't get so concerned about them now.
two or three days a month i spend raging around my house, my mind going 100 miles an hour, going over and over and over my notes, articles, the labels of foods and vitamins, just trying to find the thing i missed that will make the whole picture make sense.
i finally just let him sleep without socks on and kept his nails cut as short as i possibly could.
it's easy to put so much energy into how it looks, comparing it to how other people's skin looks, without any idea of what is the "normal" way for their skin to look.
once we washed his face (gently) a couple times throughout the day, he looked much better -- just several scratches on his cheek.
the blood test in my opinion means nothing, even my gi never performed these tests on mac.
the aveeno oatmeal bath caused full body contact dermatitis.
i spoke to his doctor's office this morning, and they said to apply neosporin 3 times today, and if it's not much better by tomorrow, bring him in.
a thorough cleansing should help the itching quite a bit.
the side effects can be nasty, but are rare and are more likely when it is combined with other drugs.
fever up to 104 about every two weeks for three months, they i didn't sleep because of worry now i don't sleep because of the itch factor.
he's always been sensitive, emotionally, but this physical sensitivity is striking.
it is so amazing how many people have the same problems as our household.

i am researching the possibility of asbestos being the problem at the house i live in now.
interestingly it's not the caffeine that nullifies the remedy, it's coffee.
i'm not doing a green leafy thing so i don't know anything about it.
i think that, in general, with most chronic problems, modern western medicine seems to do just this.
the no-grain day included other nice carbos, but it was tough on quinoa and amaranth day--we did/do a lot of baking with those grains, and it's tricky...
the other day in the supermarket i found a carton of 'tidman's sea salt for bathing'.
for dave, however, understand that this is a very treatable eye condition.
i tried primrose oil along time ago and don't remember that it helped much but since your post, i think i will try it again.
daniel just sits on the floor, pulls his pant legs up as far as he can, pulls his socks off and scratches til he is almost bleeding.
and scratching is a short-term stimulation, not the deeply fulfilling comfort of tenderness, so scratching just leads to more scratching.
sometimes this condition makes me feel so alone in the world and it is nice to know that there are others that can empathize.
i don't think it's good to take *any* drug all the time, if you can avoid it.
the timing was interesting because we had talked to an old-time pharmacist who swore by tar shampoo for cradle cap for his children (now grown) but said he couldn't remember the last time he had some in the store.
it was mentioned on the list that high doses could cause problems with brain function, but i think i'm too old for that to apply!date: 26 feb 1997 12:22:03 from: kim subject: more on the bath issue both our ped and derm said once a week for a bath.

i also remember my mum using olive oil on my scalp eczema when i was younger.
did i tell you that i also broke down when julia was sick with croup 2 weeks ago, and took her to a derm.
the cortisone creams, i believe, everyone has to switch around because you can build up a tolerance to them.
i use lubriderm as a moisturizer (my doctor's suggestion) and clotriminazole 1% (i got that tip here).
a neigbor told us about bag balm, it turns out to have sulpha in it and caused our daughter to break out head to toe in hives... we were very scared and finally went to a pediatrician and were immediately given the full regimen- prednisolone, oral antibiotic and baby benadryl.
simply because, from my experience, only light cleansing is more irritative than none whatsoever.
but for those like me who can't get to a beach regularly, this could be a substitute.
my husband has a better understsanding on the inability to stop scratching than i do since he grew up with eczema, but not on his face, it was mostly wrists and arms.
i do rub brian's back sometimes, but he scratches his head the most, so i try to rub his head (and massage with baby oil) for him whenever i catch him scratching.
he seems to know what he's talking about, i think he's scared of overwhelming us though with too much information.
i figure that i am allergic to some sort of petroleum derivitive in the cream.
the first 2 weeks her skin weeped so much i was really worried.
they do not get dirt out of my husband's clothes (construction worker).
the formula he is recommending is the most expensive stuff on the market.
my friend rubbed my back yesterday and that was wonderful.
added benefit: my grocery bills go *way* down.
i am not sure if you can do this with a toddler but vitamin c gives me a lot of relief.
she said the doc was saying it was something new & effective for psorasis and eczema.
i use evening primrose oil topically on his really bad spots but we aren't seeing any real difference.
if i'm really bad, i will take a bath with alpha keri bath oil and mineral oil or canola oil, then use mineral oil as a lotion when i get out, then vaseline over that.
along with this, i treat the condition further with schering's elocon ointment (0.1%) (a steroid cream; not regularly), and vaseline intensive care lotion: sensitive dry skin w/ oatmeal.
when i was pregnant, my hormones went crazy (of course!), and so did my eczema.
and i had a similar experience with helping one of my younger sisters who had really bad asthma.
the only thing that i've known to give me equal satisfaction is when i can ask a friend to gently rub my back, and of course this has to be a very close friend, and i have to be willing to let myself sink into the feeling in my body at the time.
also, i just figured out that i'm allergic to polypropylene glycol which is in the majority of medications my doctor prescribed to me for all these years.
we also think that his eczema got triggered by a series of antibiotics that he was on to fight ear infections that began at about 5 months.
we had tried elimination diets in the past but these were unsuccessful since she is allergic to so many different foods.
i then eliminated all milk products from my diet, as well as anything that seemed to affect katie.
it's not weeping; it just looks like patchy, dry red spots.
i think that the same thing happened to isaac--i was drinking lots of milk, and eating lots of peanut butter, when i was breastfeeding him, and i was making him sick.
you don't have to put up with people's crap.
the condition of her spine always coincides with the state of her eczema.
i think i ended up paying for the use of all that medication i took as a child; i am now allergic to all oral antibiotics (can't take any without getting violently ill and breaking out in hives).
date: 3 feb 1997 13:12:47 from: royce subject: coffee & homepathic remedies i know that you're not supposed to drink coffee when taking homeopathic remedies.
i have two young boys, so i am constanly washing my hands throughout the day.
anyway don't worry about the having to be different yet.
i read their advertising on the internet and it sounds like a miracle; but then again, it is their own advertising.
she also tends to scratch more when she is not content i.e. like when she is sleepy but doesn't want to sleep; or if she can't get to where she wants to go.
he placed him on a special diet along with the anti histamine (periactin).
this makes it much harder for him to get at his legs, and definitely helps him not scratch.
when i see them, i put tea tree oil ointment over them to avoid secondary infection.
it's a glutinous rice cake that you can bake in the oven; makes a hearty, sticky bun with a crust.
didn't seem to know why she was worse again on mon.
sometimes when he is scratching alot i lay him across my lap and rub his back and down his legs.
since the 2nd visit she's been eating better again.
i don't think my "drugs for every occasion" book exactly says terfenadine is safe.
we saw two different ones, and stopped after he became very scared of the second one (her adjustments hurt him).
things were going well, the eczema on my legs had stopped oozing, the rest of my body was not noticeable, no itching to speak of.
and the omission of oils from these lotions may help explain their effectiveness in my case.
it is just as soothing as aveeno and a lot less expensive.
you have to come to the office to be checked 6 times (baseline test, then week 1, week 4, week 8, week 12, and week 16 as follow-up).
when he scratches now, instead of that red and abraded skin, he gets big patches of welts--dozens of small, white bumps, amost contiguous to each other.
this product is not seen as much as the standard "all" but i am sure if you ask your store manager to order it he/she would, as it sells easily.
the more you care about it, the more others will care about it.
i had very few reactions to foods, just swordfish.
i would really appreciate it if you or anyone else who may know of of a cortisone that doesn't contain polypropylene glycol could let me know the name(s).
she was a beautiful bride and she had a beautiful wedding.
so i have to get over my own stuff and dress him lightly.
they love it 'cos the veggies are slightly sweet.
i took her to our family doctor who diagnosed her with eczema and told us to apply lubriderm lotion and benedryl for the itchiness.
but i often feel we will find one day that eczema is just the skin's way of reacting to a number of things the body doesn't like and has no consistent cause.
thanks for your point of view re: touching, physical contact.
so, it turns out that diprobase, cost gbp 12.50 for 500g contains exactly the same ingredients (possibly in different proportions, admittedly) as aqueous cream, cost gbp 2.50 for 500g.
tell them to stop it, that they don't have a clue.
my skin also tolerates glycerin much better than it does mineral oil.
many, many foods make his face red and blotchy as he eats (he's not too neat).
he is crancy, flaring up, generally unhappy.
the trick, however (which my parents did not do with her) was to stay loving and close and be willing to put up with the tirades that would come with forcing him to stop... when i think of all the nights that that little girl lay in her bed, with socks pinned over her hands, moaning and crying, i cry.
p.s. vitamins help me a lot-- c and e date: 19 feb 1997 19:26:31 from: patsy subject: good condition i've hesitated to say anything for fear it would put a jinx on this improvement, but i chance it to say my skin is in the best condition it's been in since i first encountered eczema.
in their opinion, kids retain these symptoms for their whole lives because doctors don't change anything that causes the problems--they just deal with the manifestations--quiet the skin with steroids, open the bronchial tubes with inhalants, etc.
also, i have had a dr tell me how to tell if someone has eczema.
she just had chronic breakouts--every single day, worsenig as time went on.
also, with wedding dress-shopping in particular, there may be emotional baggage aggravating the e. (been there!).
he said his wife and children were itchy from head to toe and they are totally clear now.
i also just started l-lysine, and would be interested to hear of any side-effects anyone may have noticed.
he seems much better since i quit nursing (until his episode the other night).
i've also felt painfully self-conscious in the bridal salons i've been in, worried that the sales assistant was looking at the spots on my arms.
we prefer this to scratching, but we occasionally try to break this one up, too, just to make sure he isn't "going away" to deal with his problem by himself.
well, the benefit from the chinese herbal treatment seems to give way to a series of countered epidsodes .
i would put money on a bet that in the next twenty years, they will find that antibiotics and steroids contribute to the progression from eczema to athsma...
no itching in 8 days.
the leaves i puree and mix with her rice and meat.
they will pay $140 for participation.
also, we sometimes play a game where i hug him if i'm still itchy after putting lotion on; i hug him as many times as i feel itchy.
they do not get the children's daily grime out, either.
she's doing great: clearing completely on some days.
if you hate it cooked, try it soaked briefly in soy milk or hot water, and spiked with dried fruits and nuts, i.e., make your own muesli.
i've had a look at http://www.fda.gov and found nothing on it, but that may be because i didn't know where to look and the search engine didn't work.
i understand the problem occurs in combination with certain antibiotics - including erythromycin - interesting since a lot of us have probably had the case of antibiotics and triludan!
i would really appreciate it if you or anyone else who may know of of a cortisone that doesn't contain polypropylene glycol could let me know the name(s).
they are amazed at what he looks like now--no extra eyelid folds, no ear cracks, a clear face, etc.
e. i also stopped drinking milk myself when i resumed breast feeding.
when i began to really not even care about it, i began dating this absolutely gorgeous girl (and its flare-ups decreased).
then last month he fell off even that curve, and our doctors were concerned that we have more than eczema to worry about.
my derm -- having tried everything else (in orthodox medicine) -- wants to put me on immuran, which is another immunosuppressant, but i am very wary.
in addition to the germ killing affect of the sun and the affect the ocean water's contents must have on the skin, i theorize that the skin is purged by the profuse perspiration that occurs when we go in the sun.
the dr. still says that even though the allergies make the e worse, he will still always have some problem with it since my husband has e and is allergic to dogs and cats.
yesterday i went and had some food allergy testing done and once again nothing.
we've taken julia to 3 chiropractor appts.
a little allergic to citrus, beef, chicken, wheat and a few other things.
i use curel unscented almost exclusively because it's glycerin-based, with no mineral oil.
my herb doctor said that seafood can easily cause flare-up.
the exceptions are quinoa and amaranth (buckwheat, though unrelated, has some similar chemical properties, apparently).
i do manage to keep it under control (it's always worse during winter and during certain times of the month), but i *can't stand* the looks of consternation on my relatives' faces when they see it.
never used antihistamine either, only used steroid for a short period.
sometimes i think that my eczema is really everyone else's problem nearly as much as it is mine because they have to look at it -- and on your wedding day, it's their tough luck.
this wasn't a big shock to me since she was showing other signs of stomach distress at home: squirming all over when nursing again, etc... hmmmm.
a little allergic to citrus, beef, chicken, wheat and a few other things.
so the body just keeps manifesting the underlying problems--first through eczema, then through athsma, etc.
the allergist says daniel will most likely outgrow the food allergies all but eggs and peanuts, but by the time he is 4 or 5 will become allergic to airborne allergins.
the name on the bottle says therapeutic atrac-tain with 5% urea.
his face and hands are still red and swollen and he gets blotches on the rest of his body that come and go daily.
anyway, i just wanted to know if anyone can empathize with what i'm feeling.
if you're not doing homeopathy, don't worry about it.
baby is baby, the only way you can help is try (very hard) to divert his/her attention from scratching during the day and wear one-piece "body suit" and use looong gloves (we use adult socks ) at night.
the pharmacist suggested switching to a hydrocorozone mix with a cetaphil base.
then if that doesn't work i will look for the nutregena t. about new clothes.
date: 13 feb 1997 13:40:34 from: shelley subject: gamma interferon research study i finally got hold of one of the doctors involved in the gamma interferon study at ucsf.
i am miserable in my own skin with it head to toe.
anyway, it is true what you said that you can never tell how bad it is going to be.
the only thing that i've known to give me equal satisfaction is when i can ask a friend to gently rub my back, and of course this has to be a very close friend, and i have to be willing to let myself sink into the feeling in my body at the time.
i haven't noticed any food allergies, but i am keeping a food diary, which i just started recently.
it helps to know there are other moms out there going through the same struggle.
i used to take at least one oatmeal bath a day and it was the only time i felt comfortable in my skin.
someone at work yesterday said that my face was not swollen like normal.
this year he has been sick enough to see the dr only once since july, so things do seem to get better has they get older.
but there's a big difference between knowing and being able to do something about it, sometimes... and feeling like i have to hide my scratching or get lectured only makes things worse...
shanon, i've never tried alpha keri bath oil.
i've also been giving her colloidal trace minerals.
the aveeno oatmeal bath caused full body contact dermatitis.
after just spending 3 months with an unsuccessful one, though, i wasn't feeling as confident as she was.
though it is not one of the most pleasant things in the world, it is not as bad for the skin in my opinion as just plain scratching.
we've been out of that for a few weeks, and i have noticed that since it being neglected, the eczema has worsened just a bit.
fortunately i found a dress that i loved on the first visit.
the summers that i went swimming very regularly were the ones that i had the least problems, if i could tolerate the clorine.
she has had so many injections of cortisteroids that drs now tell her she has probably done considerable damage to some vital systems.
we started feeding him corn this week, and his back and stomach are broke out again with e. wonder if he's allergic to it?
for example, when isaac's skin was terrible, by age 8 or 9 months, our doctors assured us that he was "atopic," (we both had allergies as kids; my husband still has them), and that it was very likely that he'd a) be in the 40% of babies who kept their eczema for their whole lives; and b) develop athsma when he got older.
since she was no where near raw/bleeding/oozing this time she's practically clear after only 2 days of no real itching.
sure your skin could be broken out, but it could be really good because you'll be so happy, right?
who again diagnosed hannah with atopic dermitis.
i just went to the dermatologist last night and he gave me a sample of temovate .05%
i'm back to eczema on my legs only.
so jodi will have to go fetch it again.
but since she hates lying on her belly or being in the crawling position, there are times she can't find anything to support herself to move around.
getting in was tough because the salt water would burn but my mother would make me get in knowing the results would be good.
yet, the antibacterial stuff works really well, as long as i don't forget the nivea skin conditioning oil.
we have been struggling with his weight for so long--he limps along on his little 1st percentile growth curve.
do keep us posted, and i wish you luck with the necessary treatments.
when allergy testing showed a mild reaction to potatoes, we took her off of that favourite food and her skin cleared up considerably.
after just spending 3 months with an unsuccessful one, though, i wasn't feeling as confident as she was.
they seem to make no real difference in the sense that if she's itchy she still wakes up to scratch regardless of being drugged around the clock (which i did for a week).
she seemed to undergo a transformation... clear, beautiful skin, and she became a truly joyful child.
actually what i've used instead with similar results is: take a piece of cheesecloth, put oatmeal (i used organic when i could) in it and tie it up tight.
things have stabilized, though my wife is still very interested in getting input from other homeopathic docs or people, and herbalists.
one thing i found out is my wife and my eczema son both feel a lot warmer than me.
just do the best you can do and keep talking about your fears with your loved ones.
the stuff also comes in a small one inch square can if you want to sample.
that's one reason we have this list -- so we can vent our feelings without offending professionals on whom we must rely.
i've tried various herbs but what i found is that i seem to be allergic or sensitive to many of them probably because i am allergic to plants and flowers.
it's like osteopathy without the force.
from: jolie subject: childhood eczema look into a book called "is this your child" by dr. doris rapp.
at one time i was allergic to eggs; now they don't bother me at all.
her diagnosis is toxins in the blood.
unlike manual breast pumps, the industrial pump is very gentle on your skin and does the job really quickly.
it seems to protect it and it keeps me from scratching.
i just laughed and told her i'd stop as quickly as possible (within a week).
not like her sister, who cried out for help when she was in the same situation at the same age.
she's been going to a hom eopath for 5 months.
royce subject: - egyptian cotton sheets flannel sheets seem softer to the touch but they still make me a little itchy.

and it helped me clearing my scalp problem (most of it).
i am now looking for a liquid form of the same type which can be mixed in his food.
2 more major flare ups within the past 10 days, both happened when we were dining out in a restaurant which was overheated and crowded.
many, many foods make his face red and blotchy as he eats (he's not too neat).
date: 12 feb 1997 09:22:21 from: nancy subject: happy to be back i've been reading your posts for a couple of months and was surprised to see that there is a link between asthma, allergy, stomach problems and eczema.
because of that, even though i eliminated other suspect foods, there never was any profound change in her eczema.
for a while, say at age 11 or 12 mos, this actually worked to help him stop.
my mother and i have gone back over my highs and lows with it and the relationship to the homes that we lived in.
we don't eat any corn, i make our bread and we eat almost no premade food.
no really big deal, as meat is ok.
i started it to help her sleep better while sick with croup a few weeks ago.
it is so amazing how many people have the same problems as our household.
isaac thinks this is very funny, and he tries it, too.
from what i've read so far, it does seem that one person's cure is another's nightmare, such as lanolin.
it's a pain, but the theory makes sense--you don't load the kid up with any particular food, and their bodies can tolerate the small, intermittent amounts.
he is crancy, flaring up, generally unhappy.
they include the mcdougall program, and the mcdougall program for maximum weight loss, and at least 2 books of recipe collections.
i don't know but wonder if this tight weave makes things tougher for the dust mites.
i don't know what condition my eczema will be in on the day of the wedding, so that has limited my choices of dress styles (i don't trust my back/arm eczema enough to wear a sleeveless dress with a low back, but then co-workers ask my why i would want to wear a dress with short sleeves in hot weather, etc.).
the guy had a terrible "bedside manner," and i was so pissed off at his seeming disregard for what *i* needed that i didn't follow his advice.
my eczema was most active on my hands, and feet, though at times it attacked my ears badly.
i was trying to eat nutritious snacks to keep my weight up -- i kept losing weight while nursing.
when her body temperature rises, her skin acts up and rashes develop quickly, especially on her cheeks.
i've also felt painfully self-conscious in the bridal salons i've been in, worried that the sales assistant was looking at the spots on my arms.

oddly enough he has no problem with milk and that is usually a big one.
but i'm loathe to have coffee again as i think my improvement might be partly due to giving it up.
i found this message on sci.med.nutrition.
it was difficult to stop so suddenly, although i was down to feeding him only 2 or 3 times a day since i work full-time.
the trick, however (which my parents did not do with her) was to stay loving and close and be willing to put up with the tirades that would come with forcing him to stop... when i think of all the nights that that little girl lay in her bed, with socks pinned over her hands, moaning and crying, i cry.
his legs are still a mess, but they're getting better.
the anticholinergic effects of terfandine may be increased by drgus which have anticholinergic effects.
when i'm red or itchy i do the "evaporation" thing which seems to help.
i am super sensitive about my eczema and when it's bad i feel disgusting.
i have already sent away for mailings on how daniel can cope with all this growing up.
i watch what i eat (basically stay away from starch or high carbohydrate foods, citric acid, yeast, nuts, most cheeses (i'm allergic to mold) and fermented foods (including vinegar) although sweet potatoes & yams don't bother me.
i have signed jodi up for the clinical study as she'll be a year old in 2 weeks.
he was concerned that she was pretty tight again, out of the blue.
daniel's head is real flaky and itchy and scabby from scratching.
so many possible factors: salt water is healing; sun is good too (as in uva treatments); being on vacation usaully means time away from work stress and/or dusty house with pet dander; ocean air is generally pollen free; vacation clothes less irritating than work clothes...
9 years after bonnie was born, i had katie and immediately recognized her problem.
i used to visit my sister's house practically daily.
and the sheets are almost always over-sized and really nice.
i used to use a hydrocorozone cream that was in a cold cream type base.
triludan (terfenadine) my understanding, from talking to my pharmacist is that it is purely an interaction problem.
she looked happy and comfortable from within.
i took isaac to the pediatrician yesterday because he'd developed new spots on his chest--a new kind of spot he hasn't had before--not even hive-ish.
generally, i prefer to deal with hives rather than eczema (because hives go away on their own), but the hives are more medically significant.
he still gets ear infections, but our ent lets him fight the infections without drugs.
since removing some of these foods from his diet his skin has improved but not totally.
she was a beautiful bride and she had a beautiful wedding.
now we are been bathing her every other day with cetaphil, no baths.
and, unfortunately, once i wasn't breastfeeding him anymore, he got in this never-ending cycle of ear infections.
date: 18 feb 1997 17:32:03 from: unknown subject: a newcomer my daughter is also allergic to tomatoes she reacts with redness, itching and hives around her mouth.
if i can explain to him that i want very much to stop scratching, but need to find a way to do it that i can live with, as he needed to do with his weight, then i believe he will understand.
tina - i suppose when it comes atopy, the bottom line is really bad genes.
i know women who, for religious regions, never wear sleeveless garments.
there are good books on herbal care for children at most natural food coops.
but there's a big difference between knowing and being able to do something about it, sometimes... and feeling like i have to hide my scratching or get lectured only makes things worse...
not like her sister, who cried out for help when she was in the same situation at the same age.
tell them to stop it, that they don't have a clue.
evening primrose oil i use it myself (i'm 32).
i tried them anyway, and i have had great success.
so i would recommend being up front with someone like a dressmaker or sales clerk -- their job is to help you find a dress to let the inner beauty shine through, and i expect they will all have good suggestions for your outer looks as well if you let them know what you're up against.
when i was a teen, i cleared up and had no problems until about four years ago.
the force of the scratching seems to be the only thing that equals the force of the frustration.
we also think that his eczema got triggered by a series of antibiotics that he was on to fight ear infections that began at about 5 months.
a good portion of these books review the health benefits of the diets, and include simple and quick recipes... lots of tips for substitutions.
hope i didn't mislead anyone.
right away at 2 weeks and just got progressively worse and evolved into "eczema.
i'm going to the hair salon next week for some trial wedding hairdos and i am afraid that the woman is going to be kind of disgusted by my scaly scalp.
his face and hands are still red and swollen and he gets blotches on the rest of his body that come and go daily.
by the way, i went dress pattern shopping with my grandmother & mother and chose a pattern with a cap sleeve and high-cut back which looks stylish, but which doesn't make me feel uncomfortable.
i've tried various bleaching creams & retina a to get rid of it but those products only irritated my skin which makes the problem worse, if anything.
i also ate alot of peanut butter, nuts and dairy because i don't like much meat.
you think you figured it out until the next allergy attack and then the detective work starts all over again...
i find that prednisone works for me less and less and sometimes i don't get the maximum relief until after i have been off it for a while.
new research has shown it's not as safe as was previously thought.
i had called national jewish hospital some time ago they sugest baths up to twice a day to hydrate the skin, so i am going back to what my gut said from the start.
anyone who are interested in the pill can find a dr in canada who would contact the emergency drug release program to request for it.
i still have problems with all of those things, though especially to eggs, and any nuts.
because his strongest allergy was to peas and peanuts, we just decided not to mess around with soy (and our allergist agreed).
i feel more dry the longer i go without.
turned out he was a dentist -- (i laughed and explained, but notice i have not been dancing since.)
the dr checked her pulse, skin, tongue etc every day and changed the herbal mix as needed.
after pushing her, she said that the essential fatty acids that she worries most about are not actually gamma-linolenic (in epo), but the ones in fish oils--the omega-3 essential fatty acids.
the side effects can be nasty, but are rare and are more likely when it is combined with other drugs.
it is light, not greasy, and gives your skin a cooling sensation.
i removed almost everything from her diet except rice, pears, apples, sweet potatoes, squash.
lets find out what is causing the outbreaks and go from there.
some of the side effects i have read or been told about are thinning of the skin---actually being able to see the little veins and bleeding easier.
so far i've experimented with eucerin, jergen's dual healing, lubriderm, and shi kai, all because i was able to get sample sizes of them.
i think i need to sit down with him and tell him that his blunt "stop that scratching" doesn't help me stop.
date: 20 feb 1997 11:01:00 from: kim subject: child eczema -reply rita, i feel the same way, if i would work just a little harder i could solve my son's problem.
she's still way better than before---hasn't gone that far backwards.
i go crazy when it gets worse than that level, but as long as i am able to see direct improvements from use of antibacterials, steroid ointments, and moisturizers, i am able to tolerate living with this condition.
so, i backed up to the pure basics again (gerber applesauce, pears, rice cereal, squash, sweet potato..).
we started feeding him corn this week, and his back and stomach are broke out again with e. wonder if he's allergic to it?
you know, i am really wondering if it's not (also) due to the homeopathic remedy.
since jodi doesn't like to lie on her belly, and seems to like standing up like everyone else in the family, one of our favorite games is that while i sit in the center of a couch, i ask jodi to get a toy from one end of the couch and give it to me.
i expect he would not only not find it likely to help him, but he'd find it debilitating.
so it's good for everyday- around-town use.
i had acceptable weight gain of 33 lbs during that pregnancy.
in the beginning, when you haven't had it very long over your entire body, the visual appearance gets so much attention.
he tells me not to scratch, which is helpful when i'm not aware that i'm doing it.
i try to put these pieces together and still couldn't make sense of what i've noted.
but mainly i just wanted to offer some emotional support for what is certainly a difficult situation.
if you can clear up the itching problem, 90% of the condition is solved.
i also got a new kitten on saturday, so maybe that has something to do with it.
in fact i have not had any e. since, anywhere, except a small 1-inch patch of dry skin on my upper arm that does not grow or itch!
my arms and hands are much better, too.
debbi went one step further than i by using a chiropractor.
i am not on the edge of constant irritation and feel that i have had my sense of humour return!
so if you need it for anti-bacterial cleansing i would not use it daily if you can avoid it.
he tells me not to scratch, which is helpful when i'm not aware that i'm doing it.
i also use theraplex emollient and clear lotion as moisturizers and sometimes vitamin e oil.
i am not willing to stop any of them right now because i am enjoying my health!!!date: 28 feb 1997 10:55:12 from: ted subject: new to list -forwarded our daughter 5 months old has had eczema since she was 3 months.
as long as we're talking about breakfast, i've been eating an immune support cereal for 2 or 3 months that i think has kicked me back into health.
then i saw the ad and walked out and bought it.
then get yourself something slinky to wear at before or after wedding activities, so you can pick when you think your skin is at its best.
at the beach, it is in the air, sand and water but when i was young it didn't help to go to the beach if i didn't go in the water.
another is highly allergy to certain food.
he seems to know what he's talking about, i think he's scared of overwhelming us though with too much information.
i was also advised not to breast feed my baby for a week to see if breast milk was the culprit.
the sun is shining and i'm going out to take a walk.
i used to think her problem is leaky gut but am not so sure anymore.
one store told me that they have "sheets with all kinds of designs"... !
he started sucking his thumb and twirling his hair--a trick he still uses when he is frustrated or overwhelmed.
anyway, i just wanted to know if anyone can empathize with what i'm feeling.
i ordered the video "alexander, the elephant who can't eat peanuts".
anyway, i can't even believe my eyes.
i called my homeopathic md for a referral for a chiropractor, unfortunately he is unavailable until monday.
it does directly affect the baby.
there are a ton of chiros everywhere, as opposed to the amount of pedi gi's, for example.
also, i am on an anti detergent kick, i remember kaye was going to try those disks to use in the washing machine.
i hope your patch test shows something.
by stopping itches as soon as possible with cold water followed by air drying, i've pretty much got it to a tolerable stage.
and scratching is a short-term stimulation, not the deeply fulfilling comfort of tenderness, so scratching just leads to more scratching.
but if i could have gotten over the hurt from his manner, and enlisted my husband's help in figuring out a new diet (instead of feeling defensive because he agreed with the guy's recommendation), it probably would have helped isaac.
" when i start scratching, i immediately put some lotion on, or anti-itch cream (sarna) or steroid ointment, depending on how the e. looks (dry, bumpy, etc.).
i like having the communication even if it is 2:00 a.m.
my husband actually has more of an understanding than i do since he has e. he remembers when he was a toddler that he use to take a receiving blanket and wrap it around his arms so he wouldn't scratch too hard.
even the cold water/damp sheet didn't work, and it usually does.
i use to work in retail and would stock shelves and just the chemicals from the cardboard would make me red and itchy---i don't have e. sue, thanks for the imput on e, allergies and asthma.
sorry to hear mac got so sick, i know how scary that is last winter.
the herbs were said to cleanse the toxins and expell them through the skin and intestines via her bowel movements.
well, this anti-bacterial lotion really makes my hands break out bad!!!
and they are actually suggesting now that maybe he will be part of the 60% of baby eczema sufferers who will outgrow it.
well, now that you mention it, yes, at one time i *did* use my teeth to scratch myself, and did so quite regularly up until about a year ago (when i started trying to take care of the stuff... by simply not scratching even though it about drove me out of my mind, as well as experiments with vitamin supplements.
he's had rast tests that identified peas, peanuts, and dairy as allergens, but we know that he has at least superficial (skin irritation) sensitivities to eggs, peaches, tomatoes, and especially mold.
before we did that daniel was awake every 20 minutes to an hour scratching and crying.
they plugged him full of medications, antibiotics, drugs, drugs, drugs.
i think it was linda who talked about the guilt feelings of passing her eczema on to her kid.
thanks be to god that there are actually some beautiful females my age out there who don't care that much about looks (and subsequently, will date me).
once again, thank you (all of you) for your kind words of concern and encouragement.
eventually, we'd get his attention, and then we could talk about the challenge at hand ("it looks like your blue truck is stuck under the couch... ".
from: lynn subject: cyclosporine richard, you mentioned in yesterday's posting that you had taken cyclosporine for a year and didn't itch during that time.
also said that they just found out that head & shoulders is just as effective as the nizorol shampoo that he prescribed for me the last time i was there... interesting.
if anything, the itch is worse, but i think that's a healing response (i really hope so) as the lesions are healing up, the dry patches and my total body eczema (mild) are practically gone.
date: 28 feb 1997 10:49:17 from: alvaro subject: bad night-linda linda, don't worry, all eczema babies do that... try to use very long adult sock on his arms.
either way, it dried my (very oily) skin and that's the last thing eczema-people need.
detergent didn't seem to be a big problem for that ol' ej boy because we use all free and clear all the time, anyway.
recent research has shown that when combined, these two medications can cause fatal changes in heart rhythm.
i have noticed that a good vitamin regimen has almost eliminated the itching (it got to the point at one time that i wished i had a wire brush to scratch with), as well as induced healing.
as i said previously, i suffer from eczema, but i no longer even worry about myself (although i should).
one of my older sisters was just talking to me about how she remembered helping to care for my eczema and how that made her feel special and at the same time close to me.
the other day my husband was in restaurant with daniel and a man gave him his card and recommended trying enzymes.
he's had rast tests that identified peas, peanuts, and dairy as allergens, but we know that he has at least superficial (skin irritation) sensitivities to eggs, peaches, tomatoes, and especially mold.
i can't promise they'll help you, but they seem to have done the trick for me.
but, it gave me a weird feeling of what might be to come if we don't get things under control before he gets much older.
around that time, i ran into a product that involved a conbination of multivitamin, cheleated minerals, a variety of antioxidants and proanthocyanidins (in the class of bioflavanols.
i took isaac to the pediatrician yesterday because he'd developed new spots on his chest--a new kind of spot he hasn't had before--not even hive-ish.
my eczema goes from bad to worse to clear depending on a million things.
at the moment i'm not using cortisone because my skin is pretty much under control except for a few small areas and the usual dry, slightly itchy skin that i don't think will ever go away (i use emollients & zinc for this).
childhood eczema shelley--it is so interesting that the repetitive motion of a backrub can help actually quell the itching for you.
as i said before, i can't see why this formula should work when tubes of cortisone ointments and creams don't, but it does.
her formula is alimentum which has no milk protein or milk sugar or soy.
has eczema on his face, scalp, and a few spots on his body.
i removed almost everything from her diet except rice, pears, apples, sweet potatoes, squash.
things just can't go on this way for him.
by the way, i am the leaky gut person, my gastroenterologist diagnosed his as a birth defect.
we prefer this to scratching, but we occasionally try to break this one up, too, just to make sure he isn't "going away" to deal with his problem by himself.
now the only breakouts she's had this month have been after being around them: two bad ones after actually patting two different dogs on 2 different occassions, and then two mild ones after being in a dog family's house and then after dog owners came to our house and held her for a while, etc.
i've gotten rid of 90% of my problems, and now if i can just get rid of that last 10%, i'll be so very happy.
itchy babies and struggling moms i have been reading alot about nursing and eczema and allergies on this list.
he started sucking his thumb and twirling his hair--a trick he still uses when he is frustrated or overwhelmed.
i have been using b-v, ultravate & zinc oxide, on an informal, rotating basis to calm everything down.
one thing i find interesting about these products is that they are made with a petroleum fraction and i can't tolerate petroleum itself.
i believe diet is a major factor, as well as regular bathing.
she then rebounded and we found a dermatologist who turned us on to the aquanil hc and cetaphyl (though we dont like the lotion and now have doubts about the cleanser) and vaseline... the vaseline alone seemed to do a lot of good, though my wife hates using a petroleum product.
i will have to ask him where else so that others could check on the possibility of doing this closer to home.
it's like junk food, empty calories, you keep eating and eating and you're never full.
out in the newsgroups i have several times found people that thought they had "eczema" but really had undiagnosed dermatitis herpetiformis.
anyway, it is true what you said that you can never tell how bad it is going to be.
you know that i'll be the first to try it, no matter how badly it puts me financially "in the hole."
crossing the intestinal barrier which can cause many clinical conditions, one of which is food allergies.
both have very long leaves and what i do is snip the leaves off and steam them together.
my pet peeve is people who act as if the rash is my fault somehow, as if i rolled in poison ivy or something.
one thing i am definitely grateful for is my supportive fiance.
the biggest challenge is the grains--everything is related to wheat, and hence belongs on the same day.
those of us who've had eczema all our lives remember the hope that we would grow out of it, and i hate to be a spoil sport and say "don't get your hopes too high" because i remember how that hope kept me alive for 14 years.
he read me the riot act about all the antibiotics from last year, but what is a mom to do you work with what you have till you find something better.
when i was a child i took so much medicine for my allergies, eczema and a chronic allergic bronchitis (i had a deep mucousy horrible cough which i never found out the cause of but it went away as mysteriously as it came).
i think it helps regulate my cycle (i used to have a very irregular menstrual cycle & bad pms).
now the only breakouts she's had this month have been after being around them: two bad ones after actually patting two different dogs on 2 different occassions, and then two mild ones after being in a dog family's house and then after dog owners came to our house and held her for a while, etc.
in the past i've found that sun helps for about 2 days, then i get a really bad outbreak.
eucerin cream has worked about the best so far but it gets so greasy.
you might need to look at some bread alternatives while you undertake your "starve and the eczema will go away" diet.
when you get overwhelmed, post another message like you did, that's what we're here for.
a thorough cleansing should help the itching quite a bit.
you have to give yourself the injection every day for 3 months.
triludan fyi, i read in the paper that the fda has announced its intent to ban terfenadine, which is the active ingredient of triludan (anti-histamine).
i was kind of concerned about it being strong and burning his raw spots.
earlier in the day yesterday, she saw the chiropractor.
i don't think it is widely-used because there were only two bottles on the shelf and they look like they've been there for a while.
they remind me of my childhood of agony and help me have sympathy for my mother who had no one to talk to about her experiences.
my mother and i have gone back over my highs and lows with it and the relationship to the homes that we lived in.
so i wash as much as i can.
anything jodi has she wants too.
it is a great guide to figure out your child allergies without the aid of high technology expensive dr. visits.
i still need to locate aquaphor--if i can't find it friday i will have our pharmacy order it for me.
after 50 years of life and skin trouble, i have many permanent marks.
i had it really bad all over my belly but it went away as soon as i gave birth to juliet.
then we got word from a nutritionist that it might not be good to be giving him that much.
said she was really, really tight in the shoulder blade area, also has said she is making incredible progress--except for one session where he said she went downhill a bit.
i hope it really turns out that daniel does't care about the food differences.
however, i'm going to start bathing her often and see if that helps too.
date: 20 feb 1997 11:01:00 from: kim subject: child eczema -reply rita, i feel the same way, if i would work just a little harder i could solve my son's problem.
the fact that i'm never given two remedies at the same time could be my homeopath's idiosyncracy.
a web search should yield more information than i can give you off the top of my head.
it's great stuff though, at least from my observations.
i shout the stains of the entire gang.
i noticed that when i thought my eczema was some horrible, demonic thing, i rarely if ever dated (and incidentally, it flared up more!).
i just decided to try it because it was one that i'd never tried and it didn't contain lanolin.
but just need to get off body odor, they are fine.
we still find blood in the sheets but not nearly as bad as when he was an infant.
my homeopath feels absolutely certain that we'll get it right and that the eczema will be gone (along with future allergies, asthma... ).
one thing that i noticed throughout the years, that makes e/allergies even more annoying, is that my allergies to things change from time to time.
my skin is almost completely clear now, thanks to a good vitamin regimen, and a little change in diet.
stopping the formula and following the allergist's protocol, her skin is the clearest it has ever been.
just maybe it will make him be a leader (not wanting to be like everybody else) and that will be a big plus in the years to come.
great expression: feeling comfortable in one's skin.
so, she had 9 clearing days (with only 2 actual days of "looking" clear since she started out as mess), then went downhill for 3 days (but not too bad at all really) and now has been going back uphill for the last 3 days.
i try to avoid sweating if possible: swimming, running at night or on a treadmill in front of a fan, bike riding in skimpy clothing.
they were 100% eqyptian cotton.
as for the other routine stuff, i also use tide free, double rinse... hot water bedding... no antibiotics (she either had a bad reaction to keflex at 7 mos.
also, we sometimes play a game where i hug him if i'm still itchy after putting lotion on; i hug him as many times as i feel itchy.
i want to share with you information regarding a new moisturizing lotion i have been using.
and in truth, it was much more effective in stopping the itching than many of the treatments the doctors prescribed.
i ask because my almost-3-year-old recently underwent allergy testing and was allergic to many of the things you mentioned, including milk and soy.
since there are so many possible causes, a diagnosis the same as my son's is very excitng.
there are foods katie avoids because they "make her tongue tingle" but no severe reactions have surfaced.
the holistic doctor said that taking enough of it (he recommended 4000mg per day) would build up the walls of the stomach so the toxins wouldn't leak out.
one thing i wish for is a vaccine for e. - i really hope they come up with something soon.
it says on the box 'helps improve skin conditions.
he said no and that topical steroids do not affect the eye itself.
the last time i had a flare up was 2 weeks before i gave birth to juliet, my older one.
lets find out what is causing the outbreaks and go from there.
i just laughed and told her i'd stop as quickly as possible (within a week).
rye is out, too, but all other grains are ok.
wow i feel like i could write a book about everything i experimented with to help my e. unfortunately, i don't know that it would necessarily help anyone.
no doctor, pharmacist or other expert has been able to give me a definite answer.
our furnishings are either leather or wood, no fabrics, drapes nor carpets.
he didn't realize it but that made me even more self-conscious than i already am.
this was new to me, i called the ambulance and had him rushed in.
she slept much better and had very good appetite.
i'm all for the specific tests he's running... and i didn't expect much more since we already got julia under control once ourselves.
it got to a point where he avoided seeing her at all, simply to keep her from harassing him about it.
eczema->athsma connection about the connection between eczema and later respiratory difficulties...
last time i had a problem was in the fall when i had a scare with my mammogram.
in all, it was a total of 9 days in a row of gradual improvement and great sleep.
my husband and i pray daily for brian (and myself) for healing of the eczema.
i just ordered the zinc stuff.
my husband has a better understsanding on the inability to stop scratching than i do since he grew up with eczema, but not on his face, it was mostly wrists and arms.
no doctor, pharmacist or other expert has been able to give me a definite answer.
generally, i prefer to deal with hives rather than eczema (because hives go away on their own), but the hives are more medically significant.
though jodi's e is not a result of milk protein or milk sugar, i think it's worth testing to see if your e baby is allergic to cow milk or soy by replacing regular formula with alimentum or if you nurse, try avoiding all products with milk protein or milk sugar or soy if you could.
it is a great guide to figure out your child allergies without the aid of high technology expensive dr. visits.
he also recommended other vitamins but i am still in search of something he can chew or tollerate.
my herbalist pals tell me milk thistle supports and repairs the liver.
they are amazed at what he looks like now--no extra eyelid folds, no ear cracks, a clear face, etc.
i takes the burn out of my skin and also seems to promote the healing.
the formula he is recommending is the most expensive stuff on the market.
i believe (though i may be wrong) that regular bathing would remove some of the bacteria that causes the itching.
i was going to try grinding some oatmeal in the food processor, but maybe i won't go through the bother.
i have noticed that since i have quit taking the nature's biotics caplet, my eczema has gotten worse, so i know that that one is helpful.
you made it much easier to get through the day.
now i'm not sure that he wouldn't have had the ear infections anyway, just because of the allergies, but in retrospect, i think i should have forced myself to stop the diary and peanuts in my diet, and kept breastfeeding him.
i was on prednisone during late pregnancy when i just couldn't stand it anymore.
sometimes stray cats live in basements of buildings and their dander gets into the heating system and bothers cat-allergic tenants who think that they don't live with cats!
i'm thrilled, but i don't like this feeling of shame that i have regarding my eczema.
(clobetasol propionate .05% in a base of purified water, isopropyl alcohol & carbomer 934p & sodium hydroxide).
our allergist only had us keep daniel off of his antihistimines for 2 days before the tests.
it's surprisingly good, firm but moist, and i can see how herbs and spices would make it different every time.
it would almost appear to me that i mark significant improvements on a weekly basis... especially this last 3 weeks.
i have used cortisone cream for twenty some odd years and i am so happy to have something else that i can use in place of it (at least most of the time).
for this reason, it's recalled from the market.
now he has learned to scratch with the backs of his hands---they are really rough and dry...
i don't give her the drop very often since her appetite is mostly good.
things that helped her included balnetar (a tar bath that soothed her skin) and aveeno colloidal oatmeal bath.
i figured that those will be pictures we will look at for the rest of our lives so i wanted to look normal.
besides my husbands e and allegies, we have a nephew with bad asthma, and my husband's great grandfather had asthma also.
i wonder though, if we are not perpetuating the problem, by taking these legal drugs so often.
all i can find about eucerit is that it's a special form of lanolin/wool wax alcohol.
the doctor just wanted to put me on stronger steroids.
we have used evening primrose oil topically only and flax seed oil orally.
he's the author that speaks about leaky gut... and says along with it there seems to be a little trouble with elimination (recommends enemas or high colonics on a fairly regular basis) and talks about specific spinal misalignments (different ones for psoriasis vs. eczema) and
if you don't already have a book like it then i think it's worth reading.
we have to become educated consumers and unfortunately waste time investigating these ingredients to see if there are actually cheaper sources for the same stuff.
spray that it started to clear up and stop itching.
in my history i have successfully treated eczema and my repetitive stress injury with one remedy, rhus tox.
the blood test in my opinion means nothing, even my gi never performed these tests on mac.
we have been struggling with his weight for so long--he limps along on his little 1st percentile growth curve.
it comes as powder in a capsule, so it was easy to give him--just sprinkled it on his applesauce.
i can also communicate successful products with an adult, the baby can't tell me if i am helping him!date: 27 feb 1997 05:30:31 from: brigit subject:
i am very excited about her development and will look into it for my son.
jodi has had no blows to her head or trauma to her spine; couldn't think of anything that could cause any neurotoxin or any malnutrition.
in fact i have not had any e. since, anywhere, except a small 1-inch patch of dry skin on my upper arm that does not grow or itch!
my son's eczema started after alot of antibiotics and we do have ear tubes, i think they were harder on us than him.
blisters first developed on her lips and perhaps through her hands somehow got onto her right cheek.
triludan my understanding is that triludan on its own is safe.
my regular dermatologist was in hawaii (probably funded by me) and the doctor filling in for him actually joked with me about my eczema.
so i would recommend being up front with someone like a dressmaker or sales clerk -- their job is to help you find a dress to let the inner beauty shine through, and i expect they will all have good suggestions for your outer looks as well if you let them know what you're up against.
in keratoconus, because of the corneal irregularity, light rays entering the eye are bent in odd ways, which blurs the image and reduces the sharpness of vision.
we still might have to do ear tubes at some point, but his ears are no worse than they were when he was on the antibiotics.
by the way, i went dress pattern shopping with my grandmother & mother and chose a pattern with a cap sleeve and high-cut back which looks stylish, but which doesn't make me feel uncomfortable.
from: kim subject: a newcomer sue, i have been through about the same thing except have not tried as many treatments.
at the moment my scalp is very good, not even dandruffy.
my daughter (age 2-1/2) has eczema and complete strangers are always asking questions about it, so i can empthasize with your self-consciousness.
hi susan, i am also new to the list and felt very moved by your post.
unfortunately, it wears off after 3 weeks.
our theory is that his eczema/scratching is in part his way of dealing with emotional challenges, and that he scratches because it distracts him from the confusion/fear/pain he's feeling about something in his life.
then if that doesn't work i will look for the nutregena t. about new clothes.
thanks to all who responded re: mothers of children with e. my heart also goes out to all the moms -- i know what it's like, and it's heartbreaking.
he is 16 months old and has been itchy since just a couple of weeks old.
when i can allow myself to really experience the feelings, i can tell that the comforting sensation of a hand rubbing my back is something i never got enough of as an infant/child.
even when i was a child, my parents built a new home and i completely cleared up.
i've just started her on flax seed oil, which is kind of similar to evening primrose oil.
i know doctors can sometimes be pretty blithe about their recommendations, not thinking through the whole picture and just concentrating on fixing the portion of the problem you've presented them with...
re: wedding dresses and e., in which she mentions turning a lovely shade of bright eczematic red when she went dress shopping.
i now have dark looking skin on my neck- the skin is normal & smooth to the touch but has dark lines which looks like dirt or a weird suntan.
i suppose it is because so many people are probably allergic to many of these things...
his skin used to be red, patchy, raised, and when he'd scratch, it would get very angry red, raised, dry looking, and eventually bleed.
my dermatologist asked me to stop nursing last week asap ...
i really can't wait to get allergy tests done on him -- as a matter of fact, i think i'll call the allergist today to schedule an appt.
when you're an itchy person the thought of this can make your skin crawl (it does mine).
and yes, i know my scratching is probably keeping him awake at night as much as it does me.
there's not too much i can use that won't irritate my skin but these moisturizers definitely have helped me.
i checked the price and asked the clerk when they would be on sale.
and if later he thinks having eczema as a child is bad, wait until he gets to become a teenager.
this stuff must be genetic, though we do see correlations between what my wife eats and our daughter's skin condition.
you can order the products straight from the company or ask your pharmacist to order them for you.
not knowing she was allergic to soy, we had been giving her soy toddler formula.
my wife has been doing the baby clothes in the laundry by doing a natural detergent at one quarter strength then a vinegar rinse followed by a baking soda rinse.
ej just recently took up scratching his scalp.
too many doctors are just "all business" so to speak, and show no empathy.
then a doctor who knows about alternative medicine (but has since closed up shop) told us to greatly increase the dosage, to 2 tablespoons per day.
the overuse of these steroids caused atrophy (at least that's what i think it is) on my neck (the skin is smooth but it's discolored -it looks like dark lines).
by the way, i didn't consider the pedi gi visit a disaster at all.
i will send another message tonight and call it e baby food.
so i resorted to benadryl for a few nights as a crutch to help break the cycle.
at the second visit he said she responded really well (stayed pretty loosened up--apparently it usually takes some retraining of the spine before it stays in the right place).
date: 13 feb 1997 13:40:34 from: shelley subject: gamma interferon research study i finally got hold of one of the doctors involved in the gamma interferon study at ucsf.
it smells like the parking lot at six flags on a sunny day (creosote) and i wonder if it will be too harsh.
date: 1 feb 1997 08:33:43 from: steve subject: betadine for reducing bacteria on skin betadine is useful for prophylactic skin cleansing.
if your eczema shows on the big day, you pin the wrap on with a brooch, if not, you just nonchalantly put it on and take it off as you wish.
i've tried pounding pillows, but that doesn't match the refined motor skill sensation of fingers scratching.
it is not the most pleasant thing in the world, especially if you date fairly regularly.
because his legs are his worse area, i have sewn socks into all of his jumpsuits and pants.
sue - though the viral attack started a month ago, jodi still has a few scattered blister-like rashes broke out on her skin here and there.
1 and a half tsp baking powder approximately 1 cup water, more if the batter's too thick.
remembers when he was a toddler that he use to take a receiving blanket and wrap it around his arms so he wouldn't scratch too hard.
i would like to find an anti-itch cream that is not totally nasty.
it was a real boost to see all the info from so many people on eczema.
actually, the summer was normally the worst for me, because i was outside the most.
frankly, one chronic, poorly-understood medical condition is plenty; i didn't need the eczema on top of the repetitive strain injury problems i already have.
she lies chest down across my lap she lies on her side.
no matter what condition your skin is in, the important thing to focus on is the wedding.
the recipes in this one are a collection from various chefs -- they can be quite elaborate, but are very good.
recent research has shown that when combined, these two medications can cause fatal changes in heart rhythm.
i really only have eczema on my hands, mostly, and i prefer b-v to the ultravate.
his legs and arms were still scratched up because of wearing shorts and such---but face wasn't as bad..
we use topical steroid creams when he gets real bad only about once or twice every couple of weeks but they scare me.
it won't stop the viral attack and it destroys good flora.
they tend to pop out on me when i get excited.
it can do nothing but make the skin worse.
the last time i had a flare up was 2 weeks before i gave birth to juliet, my older one.
when i went to the holistic doctors they said that i had a high level of candida yeast in my system and thought this might be causing the eczema to flare.
each pill was $3 and i was taking 1-3 pills per day.
by the time i've been in for a week, my legs look almost normal.
but no problems so far (she had several ear infections until she was two but now can blow her nose and has never has another).
debbie, i am sorry this gi was a disaster or so sounds like it.
her face started clearing for 3 days on her own (no cortisone), yet wasn't sleeping due to "all-over-itchies."
i have not relapsed after stopping the prednisolone and antibiotics.
i've been giving her an antihistimine once at bedtime lately too.
i buy it in 16oz. bottles and put a small squeeze bottle of it and mineral oil half and half in the shower.
never used antihistamine either, only used steroid for a short period.
i used to take at least one oatmeal bath a day and it was the only time i felt comfortable in my skin.
exercise used to give me terrible hives, redness, and itching.
since the hard lens surface is smooth and regular, the blur is eliminated.
the body can eventually heal itself if it can get out of the cycle long enough to "catch up".
i'm thrilled, but i don't like this feeling of shame that i have regarding my eczema.
one good tip from my own experience-i had very bad hay fever from puberty till age 31 when i gave up caffein and refined sugar completely (no pepsi or iced tea either) and started eating organic and only rarely red meat.
i threw out all the products i had that contained this chemical and decided only to use my theraplex moisturizers and zinc oxide ointment (a lot of the cortisone creams have this chemical in them too).
i also give ecchinacea-for-children and an herbal extract drink to my kids to boost their immune system.
e. i also stopped drinking milk myself when i resumed breast feeding.
i also know we could have it alot worse, disease and health wise...
the only thing jodi has benefited from is chinese herbal treatment.
we are still going to the chiro., although he just cut her down to once a week (after 3 wks.
i had that patch test (t.r.u.e. i believe) done twice and it showed nothing.
the rest of his body is totally free of eczema now (big hooray with lac-hydrin 5), but his scalp is a mess of dandruff.
fry sliced mush leftovers on a greased griddle to make "pancakes".
if your child is in fact actually allergic to corn it might be worth mentioning that corn products are in a zillion foods--due to corn starch and then corn syrup used as a sweetener.
our doctors just put him on one anti-biotic after another, and we went along with it, not knowing we should be concerned, for a few months.
he explained that the misalignment probably did happen at birth--after all, she was 10 lbs.
;-) i've noticed that when i'm clothes shopping or fabric shopping, my hands frequently start acting up (getting hot & itchy; patches of e. start to redden).
i came back with a full luggage of herbal mixes and just finished them all not too long ago.
most people really are not malicious, they simply do not know.
after talking with other moms on this list i took advice of severe diet changes.
bonnie still finds balnetar to be comforting (despite its awful smell) though the oatmeal now causes some problems for her.
really hot water is bad but for me hydrating the skin and moisturizing immediately after is good.
i have never seen another child's skin that looks like daniel's---we are always asked questions about his face in public.
i found it long ago, but lost it, and can't find it.
itchy heads and new clothes thanks to all who wrote about kid's scalps.
sweat purges infections i too notice great results when i'm in the sun (esp.
i have hard enough time with the food and itching.
yes, it's interesting how the drug companies mix and match ingredients and come up with a wide range of prices that don't seem to correlate to what's actually included.

i'll try it again though, as i'd also eaten more cheese than i should this last week.
the information in the database seems to speak for itself.

it feels soothing though and helps with the itch, especially on my face.
i am sensitive to most lotions and find it hard to find some type of moisturizer than won't "burn" my skin.
he will lay there as long as i want to rub.

then i could not eat enough to maintain my weight while breastfeeding, and then he tells me to cut out foods that represent about 90% of my calories.
donna is right; if people have problems with your eczema, let them deal with it.
i agree that habit and self control have little to do with scratching.
and yes, i know my scratching is probably keeping him awake at night as much as it does me.
it seems that in combination with certain other medications, which were not specified in the article, terfenadine can lead to heart rhythm problems.
i don't know why but with all the vitamins/antihistamines that i take, i'm glad that i don't gag.
i know things will get easier when juliet has passed her terrible two and jodi's immune system gets stronger.
most of the designer brands include egyptian cotton.
another thought... test your water, chlorine, bromine and possible metals can be an irritant.
today, katie does break out in hives or itchy rashes when she is exposed to animal dander, but has very few of the problems that bonnie has had to live with for most of her life.
evening primrose oil & e moms/dads -reply hang in there moms, i can remember my mom saying to me when i was young with my e "i would gladly take your place if i could".
but since she hates lying on her belly or being in the crawling position, there are times she can't find anything to support herself to move around.
when blisters show up on eczematic skin, topical antibiotic helps to stop infection from getting out of hand.
i tried it on a few items; many of the "official" ones (eucerin, lac-hydrin, aveeno, eurax etc.) are there, but the "alternative" health-food store ones (simicort, herpacine) are not.
i am so grateful for the prednisone/antibiotics 1-2 punch that seems to re-set my internal computer, and allows me to feel in control again with what i have learned to identify as a "normal" level of skin irritation for me; a certain amount of rash, open sores, dryness, itchiness, etc.
my theory about my body is that after 20 years of using topical steroids, and 6 weeks of using oral ones last summer (to combat the flare i caused by quitting the topicals cold turkey), my liver wanted to speak its mind and did so through my skin.
the pharmacist suggested switching to a hydrocorozone mix with a cetaphil base.
but no problems so far (she had several ear infections until she was two but now can blow her nose and has never has another).
it's just that jodi and her eczema gets more attention at times.
what ever dress or medication you choose, i think it is wise to have one stock phrase for those who comment on your skin.

i agree that there are worse things... diseases, etc (much worse things).
we found a homeopathic cream that we are going to try.
our dr. never said nursing caused e (i nursed just 5 and 1/2 mos) but daniel was always broke out.
no systemic antibiotic or steroid was needed, else, it would have contradicted her herbal treatment.
debbi went one step further than i by using a chiropractor.
per my contact at phytopharm, information about zemaphyte is sent out to drs in canada when requested.
if i have to take any medication i was told to take acidophilus because it helps to build up the friendly bacteria that the antibiotics kill.
he never gave me any problems going back and forth from breast and bottle.
i started flax seed oil yesterday.
after reading so much about other parents flighting their baby's eczema, i would like to voice some of my techniques i have used to help my now 20 months baby (btw, he has had eczema since birth).
the last time i went dancing, one of my partners backed away when he felt my hands (strategically bandaged!) and said "i have to ask... is that contageous?"
but since that time i have had no hay fever or significant allergies, and i used to have pills and steroid inhaler-the works.
the only time i double rinse is when i accidentally add too much detergent.
this was suggested by our doctor, and is hard for me to do because i grew up being constantly cold (for economic reasons) and have a big emotional reaction to cold.

date: 13 feb 1997 09:35:00 from: gary subject: glycerin that's interesting, because glycerin is one of the few things my skin will tolerate.
body and face seems to caused by food allergies (from internal) whereas arms, legs from dust ..etc (from external source).
when you get overwhelmed, post another message like you did, that's what we're here for.
i've been quite concerned that i've had my daughter on such a repetitive diet, albeit mild and bland foods for her to digest.
i would also recommend that when you clean him, clean him thoroughly.
we went through a bottle of the stuff, but never noticed any change, and quit.
so i don't think the drying effect is real important for me) but it might help you to get away from the oily meds.
i figure that i am allergic to some sort of petroleum derivitive in the cream.
also, i am ready a pretty good book call "allergies...
but since i was warned by the dr about such a reaction, i was prepared to take on the shock.
even when i was a child, my parents built a new home and i completely cleared up.
anyways, a way around this is to have the sleeves made out of lace -- it will give you the coverage you seek, yet be cool in the summer.
they had to send blood to a special clinic.
my chemistry isn't great, but if glycerin is one of those substances that draws water to itself (hydrophilic?) from the air, then it must also drag water out of any other surface it's in contact with, in this case the skin.
you might ask your pharmacist if s/he can order it; my dermatologist suggested it to me.
i try to put these pieces together and still couldn't make sense of what i've noted.
i have my fingers crossed, fully expecting this beast to rear its head again, but at least i have hope now.
then, starting on the 3rd week, her eczematic skin turned from red-inflamed-hard-weepy-acne-like to soft and dry.
now my philosophy (this week, anyway) is to use drugs for an emergency but to still continue all prevention measures and keep pursuing original cause(s).
if my mother had had the intelligence to handle the emotional aspects i think i would have made major improvement.
the mush idea i'd stumbled on already, what i'd done is mix 1 measure of corn flour with 2 measures of boiling water and a dash of walnut oil, then bake in the oven for about half an hour, then cut up in cubes.
sue and faith-----our first dr. said of daniel's bad skin----he just has eczema, like his dad.
i was kind of concerned about it being strong and burning his raw spots.
i use mineral oil to take my make-up off at night or as a "night creme".
aveeno powder is 100% colloidal oatmeal.
but if she's really itchy the antihistimine doesn't do a thing--she'll still wake up all night.
i used to take it religiously and i will probably start that again because i think it's helpful.
this really gets frustrating.
she has no diaper rash from her poo which may suggest undigested food and she has very good appetite.
so far, we haven't been able to pinpoint what causes it.
date: 20 feb 1997 13:26:22 from: shelley subject: patsy & issac as sue described her son isaac, who scratches when he is frustrated, i realized that i too learned this habit in infancy and never got over it.
our dr. never said nursing caused e (i nursed just 5 and 1/2 mos) but daniel was always broke out.
in the last couple of weeks, we have noticed a change in isaac's skin--i've even wondered if he even has eczema anymore.
well, in the good old days, ointments did have fewer ingredients than creams.
tomatoes, potatoes and peppers are in the deadly nightshade family.
this game keeps both girls happy and they both have my attention.
tomatoes, potatoes and peppers are in the deadly nightshade family.
maybe i'll get some of that to make ocean water to soak my hands in.
he said that people with eczema do not have much if any gag reflex.
the dr. still says that even though the allergies make the e worse, he will still always have some problem with it since my husband has e and is allergic to dogs and cats.
i think i need to sit down with him and tell him that his blunt "stop that scratching" doesn't help me stop.
i discovered this while using desowen lotion- after using it on my face & other areas of my body for over a year.
date: 6 feb 1997 22:09:16 from: ann subject: scalp royce, i have had good results with t-gel shampoo by neutragena (leave it on scalp for a few minutes before rinsing, and do a second application if you have time).
i think it was linda who talked about the guilt feelings of passing her eczema on to her kid.
she's also a great source of advice on isaac.
and i didn't expect much more since we already got julia under control once ourselves.
4 cups grain flakes, usually oats 2 cups oat bran 1 cup ground flax seeds 1 cup ground milk thistle seeds mix, store in the fridge, and let soak in hot water for half an hour before eating.
the herbs (from my research) are quite lethal.
for those of us who have often wished we could go out with a paper bag over our heads (and for everyone else, too), i heartily recommend reading lucy grealy's book autobiography of a face -- her story of growing up with a facial deformity.
you're right, yams are not in the nightshade family.
i might also suggest that "sun bathing" be used as well.

i for one will not be taking any more triludan.
he said long term use of steroid drops (which i have been using for the infections) can eventually cause glaucoma.
i noticed that when i thought my eczema was some horrible, demonic thing, i rarely if ever dated (and incidentally, it flared up more!).
since jodi doesn't like to lie on her belly, and seems to like standing up like everyone else in the family, one of our favorite games is that while i sit in the center of a couch, i ask jodi to get a toy from one end of the couch and give it to me.
we have had success with lamb, turkey, butternut squash, baby food squash, prunes, peas and spinach.
sue also mentioned something that she had done with isaac (and i note many of the other parents on here are doing), where she breaks him away from scratching, but in a loving, helpful way.
good luck with your wedding plans and remember that there is at least one other person out there who can totally empathize.
they predict it based on family histories of allergies.
the trick is finding the next specialist to move to...
it's complicated because you have to arrange the foods by food groups--ie, all "nightshades" on the same day (potatoes, peppers, etc), so it can get tough to figure out what goes on what day.
simple, steamed basmati rice and vegetables carrots, asparagus and broccoli, we have recently introduced chicken.
because of that, even though i eliminated other suspect foods, there never was any profound change in her eczema.
he will get better on his own.
from: debi subject: to: e baby moms i feel overwhelmed, there are quite a few of us who have babies with severe e. debbie, rita, jolie, karen and more.
the long leafy greens are only available in china town.
all i know is jodi likes cool and well ventilated places like our home.
the body can eventually heal itself if it can get out of the cycle long enough to "catch up".
my doctor raved about this stuff because it is weak enough to be used on the face.
the ophthalmologist reckoned that the general set of symptoms asthma, eczema, hay fever were not uncommon in people who suffer from keratoconus, and he implied some unknown root cause which probably leads to all of them.
she was raw, red, oozing, bleeding on her face and it started spreading more to neck, wrists, legs, and elbows.
my heart also went out to rita.
let's get organized, lets spend this week listing foods that work.
brian started with e at 5 or 6 weeks old... and i cried and cried several times in the beginning blaming myself for "giving" this disease to him.

after 40 years, the habit is so ingrained it is automatic.
i bring this up because it highlights how complicated this whole thing is, and how important it is to have some care-givers who are sensitive to the whole picture...

i would recommend that you bathe him very often in warm water (hot water will irritate the skin usually, and cold is unbearable) during the summer, as the dirt irritates the skin, causing itching.
strangely enough, my allergist never recommended zinc (which does quite well), nor any of the vitamins i take.
the ones i tried are: sulphur, sepia, graphites, apis mellipica & thyrodium (the most effective for me).

no pharmacy in town could tell me.

the doctor just wanted to put me on stronger steroids.
this also happens after outdoor exercise in the summer (in the sun) i haven't been on a beach vacation for several years, but when i was a kid, swimming in the ocean every day would clear up my hands every time, so i think the ocean has a lot to do with it.
in their opinion, kids retain these symptoms for their whole lives because doctors don't change anything that causes the problems--they just deal with the manifestations--quiet the skin with steroids, open the bronchial tubes with inhalants, etc.
i'd thought that interrupting him would just make him more frustrated, or angry (he sure reacted that way!).
i think the midnight scratch-fests and constant irritation sapped my energy reserves over the years.

if you can open the conversation, you can bring some improvement to the situation.
so, remembering this, last summer i would go three days a week after work and go in the water
maybe my skin's not so hyper dry and weak after all -- maybe if i just swab the deck more often, i'd be okay without all the gloves and vaseline routines.
actually, the summer was normally the worst for me, because i was outside the most.

date: 11 feb 1997 08:53:18 from: donna subject: colloidal oatmeal a colloidal 'solution' is not a solution in the true sense, as the particles are in fact suspended in the liquid, and not dissolved -- but the particles are so tiny that it seems to dissolve.
i have to use shout on the clothes if i am to have any luck removing stains--especially anything tomato-based..

i e-mailed and wrote to the company who manufactures the vaccine and has not heard from them yet.
she's had 4 visits w/ the chiropractor in the last 2 weeks.
i read one research paper that recommended 500 mg 3x per day for eczema, psoriasis, herpes, shingles and got very good results.

how could a dr. be so ignorant to the emotional/psychological factors of e. i'm glad you let him have it, 'cause it sounds like he certainly deserved it.
the writing on the can says it's a "antiseptic ointment for udder and teats".
unlike manual breast pumps, the industrial pump is very gentle on your skin and does the job really quickly.
we have had success with lamb, turkey, butternut squash, baby food squash, prunes, peas and spinach.
i'll be interested in everyone's response and start booking reservations for the summer.

if lace isn't good for some reason, then experiment with other light materials to cover up yet be cool.
fever up to 104 about every two weeks for three months, they i didn't sleep because of worry now i don't sleep because of the itch factor.

when my mum suggested something with a low back or no sleeves, i just said, "well, i don't know how my skin will feel that day, and i'd be happier in a different dress."
but phosphorus is doing really well against it so far.
the one thing that helps is putting jojoba oil on it.

i don't think it's good to take *any* drug all the time, if you can avoid it.
not easy for a control freak like me.
it's not weeping; it just looks like patchy, dry red spots.
i have found them at all department stores: bloomingdales, nordstroms, macy's.
he is better now but still not right.
it's only a 15 spf (burn protective) so it wouldn't be good for all day on the beach.
it makes my skin less dry, and seems to make the itching less.
he thought that it was unlikely that the steroids would *cause* the keratoconus, but that it might aggravate it, simply because steroids thin the skin etc.
at first we gave him only about a teaspoon a day, and it had no effect.
if lace isn't good for some reason, then experiment with other light materials to cover up yet be cool.
he said that people without eczema would be gagging if he did that to them.

we get it from our health food store here for about $14 for 4 ounces, which the bottle says is equivalent to 227 500mg softgels of epa (i'm trusting them--haven't done the math).
though jodi's e is not a result of milk protein or milk sugar, i think it's worth testing to see if your e baby is allergic to cow milk or soy by replacing regular formula with alimentum or if you nurse, try avoiding all products with milk protein or milk sugar or soy if you could.

date: 12 feb 1997 09:22:21 from: nancy subject: happy to be back i've been reading your posts for a couple of months and was surprised to see that there is a link between asthma, allergy, stomach problems and eczema.
i was born with eczema, came home from the hospital with it.
if books, could you please pass along the titles, annotating the ones you found most interesting and helpful.
my second pet peeve is people who with all the authority in the world announce that it is stress-related.
childhood eczema shelley--it is so interesting that the repetitive motion of a backrub can help actually quell the itching for you.
stopping the formula and following the allergist's protocol, her skin is the clearest it has ever been.
from: jolie subject: childhood eczema look into a book called "is this your child" by dr. doris rapp.
easily done at home with food elimination diets.
when i remember the times that i didn't help my sister because her whining and scratching were driving me crazy.
so i resorted to benadryl for a few nights as a crutch to help break the cycle.
so, i stopped it, and will do it at just bedtime for a bit longer---just in case it's helping at all.
we use a cortisone creme lotion when we have to (a couple of times a week).
the cornea is responsible for about two-thirds of the eye's focusing power.
the water around here gets pretty contaminated from sewage (ugh!!)
and if later he thinks having eczema as a child is bad, wait until he gets to become a teenager.
perhaps this is why saunas are beneficial too.
jodi has not had much luck since her return from her chinese herbal treatment in china.
good luck with your wedding plans and remember that there is at least one other person out there who can totally empathize.
as wendy suggested, consider prednisone as this is a very special day.
feeding your baby even if your dr asked you to stop for a while.
my family is very supportive but sometimes they say hurtful things and don't even realize what they're saying my father suggested that i make a drappy scarf out of the material from the dress to put around my neck because i have these brown lines as a result of overuse of steroid creams.
, it's a little expensive for me though so i cut it with mineral oil.
we have started a course of homeopathic treatment so we'll see how that works in about two weeks.
turns out he probably has a viral infection (white blood cell count is up), which could be accounting for why he has so many hives lately.
sure your skin could be broken out, but it could be really good because you'll be so happy, right?
as for interactions with other drugs, antifungal drugs (including ketoconazole and itraconazole) and the antibiotic erthromycin increase terfenadine levels and may affect the heart.
like i said, i don't use them but every couple of weeks and i was told never to put it on his face.
now he wakes up about once a night for a water bottle.
my theory about my body is that after 20 years of using topical steroids, and 6 weeks of using oral ones last summer (to combat the flare i caused by quitting the topicals cold turkey), my liver wanted to speak its mind and did so through my skin.
my only concern now is that the anti-fungal properties of clotriminazole will lessen due to extended usage and i may have to start using steroids again.
sometimes we even had to carry her because her skin was so bad that if she walked, scabs would break open and she'd bleed.
they remind me of my childhood of agony and help me have sympathy for my mother who had no one to talk to about her experiences.
terfenadine may increase the sedative effect of antidepressants, sleeping pills and antipsychotics, whilst antidepressants increase the chance of abnormal heart rhythms.
i have never had eczema, but some of my insights that i use to help isaac come from growing up with a younger sister who was very debilitated by it.
mac has not been well lately, he had a fever siezure on sunday.
his skin used to ooze alot back then and when he would scratch with the little socks on he would just take the layers of skin with them.
i rented an industrial breast pump when my milk first came in and when we needed to go out and jodi's still sleeping, i pumped it out for later use.
could you tell me how they do the allergy testing on a baby -- just curious in case we need to do this.

dhea, from what i understand, is a hormone regulator that everyone has some level of in their bodies.
getting his eye contact during this is tough, but important.
so we've just started up again, with 1 tsp/day, and looking for anyone who might know what a safe dose of this is.
just open the conversation saying something like "honey, i figured out something important about my skin and i need your help with it.
i'm sorry to hear about mac's illness.
the picture of jodi on the floor, scratching rather than yelling for help, is a replica of what isaac used to do.
this morning i was diagnosed with keratoconus, which is an eye disorder (specifically, the cornea).
fortunately, i was self indulgent that day and bought them anyway (about $50 a sheet).
it's the only thing that gets rid of that flaky skin for me.
i was talking to a pharmacist who said that it would be good to rotate using various kinds of antibacterials (like betadine, hibiclens, etc.)
rice flour makes good muffins (though rugged), and you can use soy flour in place of eggs in baked goods; just use 1 heaping tbsp.
date: 20 feb 1997 10:46:25 from: kim subject: a newcomer when my son was tested at 9 months it was a prick test of tiny pins (six i think) on a base that was pressed onto his back.
this frees up trapped nerves, blood vessels etc, throughout the body and allows the organs to work properly.
they plugged him full of medications, antibiotics, drugs, drugs, drugs.
i have to say, *all* who saw it didn't flinch and seemed quite at ease with it.
now my sweat makes me itch and burn, but probably only because my skin is broken.
i might also suggest that "sun bathing" be used as well.
i still struggle with that one, because right after isaac was born, we took him to a naturopath who told me i should immediately take all dairy, corn, wheat, and peanuts from my diet, as long asi was nursing him.
i've been sleeping with a soft, white cotton tee-shirt over my pillow case because it's the only thing that doesn't make me itch!
his face looked worse than it actually was from dried blood which was rubbed up and down his face.
maybe medication, though less likely) to help repair stomach, intestinal, liver areas.
usually this is a place no one can see; it figures that it's bad now when someone will need to concentrate on this area.
i needed to resort to some drugs for some instant relief as she was very sick with croup and getting worse because she wasn't sleeping at all due to itching.
from: tina subject: allergy tests-linda maybe some allergists don't have the same rules for their testing.
i'm feeling euphoric (it's probably also due to finally sleeping!).
i've done enough doctor hopping with the rsi -- time to make a stand against the eczema.
i also keep my heat turned down in the house to the point that others complain, but heat and sweat drive me batty.
i do manage to keep it under control (it's always worse during winter and during certain times of the month), but i *can't stand* the looks of consternation on my relatives' faces when they see it.
the remedy, the diet, the chiropr., etc.
i think evening primrose used topically and taken orally is helpful after about 3 months.
when i was young my dr said that the skin could absorb it better.
so, kim, the disks aren't effective for the real life dirt of active families.
other natural products that are working, simicort a cream herb product substitute for cortisone, made by enzymatic therapy in green bay wisconsin 54311 800-783-2286 also natural baby body lotion from aubrey organics 1-800-aubreyh.
after that ran out i bought some dry scalp head and shoulders.
i checked the price and asked the clerk when they would be on sale.
you can just toss it out or compost it when your done.
i had a dr tell me once that i was washing away all my own body oils and that was why i had dry skin (obviously he has never had eczema).
i went right back to nursing jodi when the expedition made no difference to her
that way they both get the attention they need.
at the moment i'm not using cortisone because my skin is pretty much under control except for a few small areas and the usual dry, slightly itchy skin that i don't think will ever go away (i use emollients & zinc for this).
i read about the study in the ease newsletter and called out of curiousity.
wendy, sorry to hear about your scratching frenzy last week.
they say it can aid in weight loss, anti-aging process and a lot of other things.
i've just started her on flax seed oil, which is kind of similar to evening primrose oil.
real meals are not much of a problem, as i'm a decent cook and work from scratch anyhow (very little ready-made stuff in my food ever); so i just choose things without cheese, cream and eggs.
telling me to stop scratching doesn't really help me at all!
my husband and i pray daily for brian (and myself) for healing of the eczema.
date: 18 feb 1997 17:32:03 from: unknown subject: a newcomer my daughter is also allergic to tomatoes she reacts with redness, itching and hives around her mouth.
various moisturizers, creams, chemicals, vitamins etc. were okay
but i get anxious and i want to try to make my skin better right away.
egyptian cotton has longer and thinner fibers allowing a higher thread count (threads per inch).
daniel has broke out after wearing an outfit that was new at christmas and it was washed before he wore it...
i hate to sound vain about surface looks, etc.
finishing the sun bathing and/or sauna sessions with cool/cold showers water seems to make a big difference in the amount of benefit accomplised, infection reduced, and increased comfort level achieved.
it gently repositions any dysfunctions in your body, and re-aligns the cranial bones to their correct position.
everyday, i brewed a big bag of herbal mix with 48 oz of water and reduced it into 6 oz of decoction.
unfortunately, for some reason it never occurred to me that my daughter could be allergic to soy, so i never eliminated that, which has turned out to be the major culprit in her case.
i do worry about enough vitamins, my homeopathic md recommended essential minerals, it did make a difference.
i have hard enough time with the food and itching.
rather, the hard lens surface effectively becomes the new surface for the eye, and the area between the hard lens and your own cornea fills in with tears.
yes, i know that my scratching is making things worse.
if any of you does want to try evening primrose oil for a baby, you might want to look for now (brand) evening primrose oil in the 4 oz. bottles.
speaking from experience, i believe breast milk is the best for babies.
i have already sent away for mailings on how daniel can cope with all this growing up.
when i read through past archives, i could relate to those of you talking about scratching for hours in bed at night.
dr. sheehan won't take anyone younger than 1.
the health food store i go to sells it for $4.19.
i have been taking my son's lunch to daycare for over a year (he is 2.5) and since he never has eaten what other kids do he doesn't seem to care.
when daniel was that age (now 16 mos) blood was a fairly normal sight in the morning.
you have to come to the office to be checked 6 times (baseline test, then week 1, week 4, week 8, week 12, and week 16 as follow-up).
it gives me hope that we can do something to break this cycle of scratching that our kids are just building now.
we are trying to help him as best we can right now, but i also believe in prayer.
these 3 things have helped tremendously.
i still struggle with that one, because right after isaac was born, we took him to a naturopath who told me i should immediately take all dairy, corn, wheat, and peanuts from my diet, as long asi was nursing him.
i don't know he could tell it's leaky gut or not without specimens.
we ended up leaving in the middle of the course but it was too late.
not easy for a control freak like me.
jodi doesn't call for our help, she simply starts scratching.
just that and water, isopropyl alcohol, "emollients" and "thickener".
i did have the chance to whisk her off to a portrait studio on her best day--so i had some luck there.
i only hope that isaac's viral infection is not going to get as ugly as jodi's.
when i turn the water off, i rub it on my skin then pat dry.
brigit's right, "bag balm" is a generic term, so there are several producers.
when we first took him to the allergist his skin was so bad they couldn't test him there.
i did complain but they looked at me like i was crazy.
i mentioned that i had been using topical steroids etc and the opto-wozzizname bloke suggested that it was more likely that it was due to the eczema itself than its treatment, although the steroids may have aggravated the situation.
he said they didn't think it would get rid of eczema permanently but would keep it under control (like insulin for diabetes).
my body doesn't seem to produce much oil so i give it some with the alpha keri (getting a soft water service helped too!!).
being right in the center of the couch allows me to stop jodi from falling when she loses her balance.
i add all kinds of dried fruit and nuts for variety.
this is supposed to be better for them--to have food pass thru more quickly.
i'm doing really well lately.
so, you've already been down the path that we might need to walk.
we are now avoiding all wool (including those expensive natural baby covers we got so many of) we bought some hepa filters, and our dogs no longer come in the house.
the little bit of itchy, flaky eczema that i had left was cleared up using the shampoo.
our allergist said there are chemicals in the clothes to make them hang nicely on the racks...
the one thing that helps is putting jojoba oil on it.
before we found out this method, my baby's ear, foot, neck are always bloody in the morning.
even knowing what i know now, though, i might not have done it, then--breastfeeding was terribly painful for me, i was really ready to quit...
the theory is that your body knows how to heal itself, and practitioners just provide that little boost of energy to kick start the process.
i am staying away from wheat, dairy and eggs, too, but here is my cereal.
i use them every day on any affected areas and it seems to help it heal and keep it from coming back.
a lower potency steroid could be taken for a longer period.
in the last few weeks, his skin has been blotchy, but the blotches are not usually raised--they're splashes of color.
if she's itchy, she still wakes up anyway though.
the author does not speak at all about children or infants so i just use common sense, ask health food store prof.
[ann, i can now empathize with your full body herpes infection.
i'm pissed that my doctor actually caused part of the problem.
perhaps they can tell us more since zemaphyte has been approved as a prescription drug in the u.k. i believe info on zemaphyte are on our archives.
i just give her a little bit of prunes every day.
the theory is that your body knows how to heal itself, and practitioners just provide that little boost of energy to kick start the process.
i'm back to eczema on my legs only.
for example, tomatoes make his face red and itchy while he eats them, but don't seem to have a secondary reaction through his skin (ie, his eczema doesn't get worse after having eaten them).
sometimes we'd have to pick him up, or put him in our laps, to get even enough of his attention to talk to him.
she agreed, and the whole process was much more low- key than i expected (no attempts on her part to find the "cause" of my e., etc.).
it has been extremely helpful on my scalp eczema.
if you work in an office, i sure would give them a try.
the last time i went dancing, one of my partners backed away when he felt my hands (strategically bandaged!) and said "i have to ask... is that contageous?"
good wishes to all, and i believe that copious amounts of love for our afflicted ones and their caregivers really does help and really does matter.
that's how honey and sugar pastes work when they're used as antibiotic dressings - they draw water out of the bacteria and kill them, i'm told.
our allergist said winter is harsher because it is so cold and dry here.
when i was young, the ocean was wonderful for my skin.
i can drink tea and eat chocolate but i can't do even decaf coffee, or a coffee nip.
things have been going a lot better nowaday as i started to learn more about it from you guys/gals!
my dermatologist doesn't think that my e. is allergy-related,
i am not on the edge of constant irritation and feel that i have had my sense of humour return!
i've been using j and j new sensitive skin formula baby shampoo but it doesn't do any good.
i've gotten rid of 90% of my problems, and now if i can just get rid of that last 10%, i'll be so very happy.
it's greasier than vaseline.
but she said she thought that babies confronted with such terrible itchiness needed their parents to step in and stop them--they just weren't strong enough to help themselves.
date: 27 feb 1997 17:42:47 from: linda subject: bad night with baby tina, you are right about the socks rubbing his skin so hard that it looks like rug burn.
fix the leaks, or remove the offending substances that leak, and the skin can get better.
we dress him two full layers lighter than we are dressed.
these are great moisturizers that my derm.
tina, it sounds like you handled the situation well with the girl at preschool.
you are fortunate in having a loved one who is there for support.
i think those were the two missing ingredients that diprobase had that aqueous cream "didn't".
but maybe the load was too big and didn't get rinsed thoroughly.
they come in dark colors and prints that hide stains from scratching and weeping.
good luck, and let us know how things go.
very little beef or tuna (suspicious foods for us).
our doctors just put him on one anti-biotic after another, and we went along with it, not knowing we should be concerned, for a few months.
i notice that when i wash jodi's hair everyday, her e clears up on her scalp.
now i'm not sure that he wouldn't have had the ear infections anyway, just because of the allergies, but in retrospect, i think i should have forced myself to stop the diary and peanuts in my diet, and kept breastfeeding him.
in addition to this, we've once again been using a slight amount of topical cortisone behind the knees (knees and neck often keep her itching all night) and a dose of antihistamine.
but now i notice i am sensitive to many products i had used for years (one ex: i used eucerin for a long time until one day it started to make my skin worse.
wash all his clothes in hot water (with all-clear, which seems to work for him), and double-rinse them.
that's how honey and sugar pastes work when they're used as antibiotic dressings - they draw water out of the bacteria and kill them, i'm told.
again, i found the first (longs proprietary formula) to be astoundingly effective on my eczema, i.e., it's vanished since i started using the stuff.
i personally suffered very much with my skin problems as a child (my brother had it too but not as bad).
i believe (though i may be wrong) that regular bathing would remove some of the bacteria that causes the itching.
i am sure many of you with eczema know the frustration of trying to sleep when everything you touch seems painful or makes you itch.
i tried them anyway, and i have had great success.
one of my sisters still had braces on her teeth when she got married, and i remember how upset she was, moaning about how the photos were going to be terrible, practicing smiling without showing her teeth, etc.
we deserve the treat of something nice next to our skin.
it took the doctors a year to figure out that i was very allergic to dairy--so allergic, that i was reacting to the dairy coming trhough my mom's breastmilk.
i hope the chiropractor etc. helps to prevent the eczema.
well, now that you mention it, yes, at one time i *did* use my teeth to scratch myself, and did so quite regularly up until about a year ago (when i started trying to take care of the stuff... by simply not scratching even though it about drove me out of my mind, as well as experiments with vitamin supplements.
the bad part is that we had to stop all antihistamines for one week prior, which made for a horrible 7 days, so be prepared for that.
i feel hesitant to give my baby steroids (although they have made a significant improvement in her skin).
easily done at home with food elimination diets.
that feeling of just not knowing how to put all the clues together to figure it out is so frustrating.
after 10 days, i tried to wean off and had a return flare as bad as the first.
when i asked the chinese dr where the toxins came from, he said it was from me when i was pregnant with her.
i used to visit my sister's house practically daily.
i found out when bonnie was 3 months old that she was suffering from allergic eczema.
i don't think that anyone believes that eczema or asthma is caused by just one thing, so it's really hard to ever wipe out the root cause.
by stopping itches as soon as possible with cold water followed by air drying, i've pretty much got it to a tolerable stage.
after i steamed the veggie, i cut the stem in 3-4 inches a piece and give them to the girls as finger food.
i brushed my hand on the sheets in a department store and couldn't believe the silky smooth feel.
misc i tried semi-cort because a few people said that it worked wonders.
i now double rinse clothing that touches the affected areas and omit fabric softener on them.
now, of course, they attribute his improvement to pure aging--he "grew out of it."
old (brian) woke up at 4 a.m. with bloody socks (which he had pulled off his hands).
she's been going to a hom eopath for 5 months.
now melt that over some corn flakes -- i think i could well live on that for a month...
(her face still looked real good at this point so he wasn't just reading her.)
anybody use just sesame oil or anything like that.
i find bag balm has very little smell to it, and what smell it does have i find "medicinal"...
i have caught up on literally years of sleep.
he will get better on his own.
there is a company called "national allergy supply, inc." 1-800-522-1448 that markets a test that you can order for $25.
if they are left alone (although they itch horribly) they will fade and disappear within 30 minutes or so.
it may also be worth noting that the cod liver oil (a & d), as well as the vitamin e are essential.
our baby is 100% breastfed, born at home.
this is my treatment for my eczema, and it helps a lot.
vaseline and mineral oil are almost the only thing she can put on her skin to protect it.
i had eczema as a child but quickly and luckily outgrew it very early on.
i've been asked all of my life about mine, and it hurts sometimes (because it is so embarassing), but i've learned to deal with it (as you obviously have).
so we began a game where we would (both) scratch our legs for a second, then throw our hands in the air and yell "stop!"
it is "nutrogena t" and we found it at the grocers after seeing an ad on television.
i ever went to said not to bathe for too long or too often but i never listened.
i nursed him for just over 5 months and our doctors all said he probably didn't have food allergies.
said it probably would have taken an adult who was that bad a good 3 mos.
when he scratches now, instead of that red and abraded skin, he gets big patches of welts--dozens of small, white bumps, amost contiguous to each other.
jojoba oil is very expensive, but some health food places sell it in bulk, and you don't need very much.
unfortunately, for some reason it never occurred to me that my daughter could be allergic to soy, so i never eliminated that, which has turned out to be the major culprit in her case.
i also cook her food from scratch.
they seem to last longer than other sheets and still look great after a couple of years of frequent washing.
right now (and for last 3 weeks) she's doing great: clearing completely on some days.
shanon - i'm beginning to believe it's something in the air which cause jodi her e.
she has no diaper rash from her poo which may suggest undigested food and she has very good appetite.
my pet peeve is people who act as if the rash is my fault somehow, as if i rolled in poison ivy or something.
i bring this up because it highlights how complicated this whole thing is, and how important it is to have some care-givers who are sensitive to the whole picture...
i don't need his concern, thank you very much.
he placed him on a special diet along with the anti histamine (periactin).
i have tried several of the supplements and creams suggested by this list, and my condition has improved considerably.
b-v is a cream, while ultraval is an ointment, kind of like vaseline.
my daughter sent me some 2oz sizes of stuff called purell instant hand sanitizer: "kills 99.9% of most common disease-causing germs within 15 seconds".
date: 13 feb 1997 09:35:00 from: gary subject: glycerin that's interesting, because glycerin is one of the few things my skin will tolerate.
egyptian cotton has longer and thinner fibers allowing a higher thread count (threads per inch).
date: 26 feb 1997 16:16:42 from: royce subject: body oil i've used various oils including sesame.
first, we would go over to him and get right in his face (which sometimes meant lying on the floor so we could look up at him), and saying something like, "looks like you're having a problem here, huh?" in a concerned, but light voice.
i don't know he could tell it's leaky gut or not without specimens.
one of my sisters still had braces on her teeth when she got married, and i remember how upset she was, moaning about how the photos were going to be terrible, practicing smiling without showing her teeth, etc.
it smells like the parking lot at six flags on a sunny day (creosote) and i wonder if it will be too harsh.
of course the steroid ointments helped immensely as did the antihistimines.
ointments (in general) don't contain things like polypropylene glycol.
daniel isn't allergic to almonds (other nuts,yes) but all the other long words probably aren't too good for him!
fortunately, i was self indulgent that day and bought them anyway (about $50 a sheet).
and he's so sensitive now... just getting excited during play will bring welts out on his face and legs.
to my surprise, i did not have any problems.
now that doesn't work as well, but he's a pretty good talker now, so we have new options.
i have been fortunate to have doctors who always prescribe ointments rather than creams.
the university of california at berkeley study, which was conducted on mice, concluded ozone rapidly strips vitamin e from the uppermost layer of skin.
except putting alpha-keri bath stuff is like lighting a match next to me.
date: 10 feb 1997 11:07:52 from: toby subject: colloidal oatmeal i think but am not positive that "colloidal" means that the oatmeal is ground up and processed so tiny that it acts like it dissolves in your tub.
does anyone know of a good remedy for an itchy, flaky, scabby eczema scalp that won't irritate my skin and that doesn't stink like tar?date: 6 feb 1997 17:04:07 from: gary subject: scalp i have found success with long's drugs scalp itch treatment lotion.
when allergy testing showed a mild reaction to potatoes, we took her off of that favourite food and her skin cleared up considerably.
i have eczema on my scalp; it's falky and scabby and i can't get rid of it.
now daniel is allergic to peanuts, but not dairy.
i was very self-conscious about it.
i would recommend that you bathe him very often in warm water (hot water will irritate the skin usually, and cold is unbearable) during the summer, as the dirt irritates the skin, causing itching.
now daniel is allergic to peanuts, but not dairy.
my skin was always so bad that i understand why my parents were reluctant to touch me, but i recommend that parents find a way to touch in a repetitive soothing manner, otherwise the child will continue to scratch in desperate efforts to provide the physical sensations they crave.
corneal transplantation is only needed if the cornea is so badly deformed that it is impossible to fit a contact lens, or if there is scarring due to the keratoconus that obscures the central vision - that is clearly the minority of patients.
colloidal oatmeal i think but am not positive that "colloidal" means that the oatmeal is ground up and processed so tiny that it acts like it dissolves in your tub.
well, the benefit from the chinese herbal treatment seems to give way to a series of countered epidsodes .
and even if a central heater is free of all allergens, the air itself is so dry that it can irritate already dry skin.
of course i also had my share of goodies -- chocolate.
i keep telling myself things could be lots worse, though.
so i haven't breastfed him since last friday evening.
i have found this to be very helpful in my case.
the derm told me to see how he is after one week off breastmilk, and if it's not better, he would need to have allergy tests done.
julia is very lucky to have someone who cares so much about her.
i am sure many of you with eczema know the frustration of trying to sleep when everything you touch seems painful or makes you itch.
so, she had 9 clearing days (with only 2 actual days of "looking" clear since she started out as mess), then went downhill for 3 days (but not too bad at all really) and now has been going back uphill for the last 3 days.
the stuff is great though.
but, to me at least, the prednisone is a known commodity: it did result in osteoporosis, but as far as my immune system goes, i rarely get sick, so don't think it is too depressed.
it cleared me up in 2 days but as i started to wean off the medication my eczema started up all over again.
we are going to see a chiro on monday on next week, while he did not think spin manip was the way to go he had a plan called b.e.s.t. that we are going to try.
he is not sleeping well even with the periactin.
but i use an exfoliating body glove on the rough dry spots.
for example, when isaac's skin was terrible, by age 8 or 9 months, our doctors assured us that he was "atopic," (we both had allergies as kids; my husband still has them), and that it was very likely that he'd a) be in the 40% of babies who kept their eczema for their whole lives; and b) develop athsma when he got older.
kids are smart--they'll find all kinds of ways to substitute for what they know they need, but aren't getting.
he wanted to "talk and play" so it must not have been as painful as it looked.
i'd thought that interrupting him would just make him more frustrated, or angry (he sure reacted that way!).
i still have problems with all of those things, though especially to eggs, and any nuts.
any way, i wanted to get some feedback from the group.
my eczema was most active on my hands, and feet, though at times it attacked my ears badly.
most people really are not malicious, they simply do not know.
we used to get concerned these food "sensitivities," but we've gotten so used to them that we don't get so concerned about them now.
he never gave me any problems going back and forth from breast and bottle.
they predict it based on family histories of allergies.
since my level was low they thought that it may have had an effect on my hormones and adrenals.
i don't think it is widely-used because there were only two bottles on the shelf and they look like they've been there for a while.
i still prefer ointments because for me, greasy is better.
it looks so much more "allergic" than it used to.
date: 24 feb 1997 11:26:00 from: ann subject: sarna/central heating someone mentioned something called sarna as an anti-itch lotion that gives the skin a "cooling sensation."
but here we go (these are all taken twice a day): along with this, i treat the condition further with schering's elocon ointment (0.1%) (a steroid cream; not regularly), and vaseline intensive care lotion: sensitive dry skin w/ oatmeal.
(you see, there is no indoor heat in china.)
then last month he fell off even that curve, and our doctors were concerned that we have more than eczema to worry about.
i've been giving her an antihistimine once at bedtime lately too.
(her face still looked real good at this point so he wasn't just reading her.)
before we did that daniel was awake every 20 minutes to an hour scratching and crying.
we are going to see a chiro on monday on next week, while he did not think spin manip was the way to go he had a plan called b.e.s.t. that we are going to try.
why not have a theme for your wedding then you can wear a dress that covers you and just say you like "traditional" or whatever.
i was very self-conscious about it.
i just used it because the pharmacist said it was good stuff for eczema.
i have never had eczema, but some of my insights that i use to help isaac come from growing up with a younger sister who was very debilitated by it.
i nursed him for just over 5 months and our doctors all said he probably didn't have food allergies.
i switch off with cortisones, zinc oxide ointment and zinc pyrithione 2%.
i have no scrupulous scientific evidence, but i have a suspicion this is down to taking valerian to aid sleep (i've taken everything and this works!) and liberal applications of tcp to deal with a recent bout of folliculitis.
never had any thrush or any sign of candida, no ear infection or use of antibiotic .
when that didn't help much i took her to a derm.
when i put that on, i can almost hear my skin gulping it down.
has eczema on his face, scalp, and a few spots on his body.
(i notice, with new understanding, how beautiful my mother looked in 1945 in her long-sleeved "old fashioned" gown!)
all the rest (habit, self-comfort) probably has a small role, but usually declines dramatically when the primary stimulus is gone.
so jodi will have to go fetch it again.
there are still mild patchy outbreaks from time to time, but it's not nearly as bad as it was.
haven't even needed the hot water trick for itching in the past week or so.
i only use it at night due to its thickness and 'stickiness', not due to its smell...
your daughter is on the same diet as my son but we have not embarked on the chinese herbs.
>> usually the md will give you a steroidal drug.
for the full text story, see http://www.merc.com/stories/cgi/story.cgi?id=1693630-6ca when people said don't scratch, all it has ever done is made me feel guilty about it, like if i had enough will-power, i could control myself.
during my "fasting" phase, her skin cleared up 100%.
because his strongest allergy was to peas and peanuts, we just decided not to mess around with soy (and our allergist agreed).
i have pored over medical journals, written to researchers, and still can't find anyone who will say what/if the negative side effects of evening primrose oil are.
the anticholinergic effects of terfandine may be increased by drgus which have anticholinergic effects.
she's never had a clear day since she got eczema at 2 wks.
my skin seems to tolerate any oil except baby oil.
if she's itchy, she still wakes up anyway though.
two or three days a month i spend raging around my house, my mind going 100 miles an hour, going over and over and over my notes, articles, the labels of foods and vitamins, just trying to find the thing i missed that will make the whole picture make sense.
but mainly i just wanted to offer some emotional support for what is certainly a difficult situation.
itchy babies and struggling moms i have been reading alot about nursing and eczema and allergies on this list.
often isaac would look away, or get this vacant look in his eyes, and keep scratching.
the more i deal with this, the more convinced i am of the bacterial/fungal connection plus stress.
i have gotten many compliments from friends and family on the condition of my facial skin, my eyes (which were typically so bloodshot that it looked as if i had been on an extended bender) and the fact that i look rested.
do whatever you can do to keep your focus off your skin so that whatever its condition, it won't take centerstage.
mac has not been well lately, he had a fever siezure on sunday.
i know things will get easier when juliet has passed her terrible two and jodi's immune system gets stronger.
this includes antipsychotics and antidepressants.
note that seldane is an antihistamine that is not supposed to make you sleepy, and the ketoconazole, i assume, is an antibiotic (because the warning mentions that it is used to treat skin infections).date: 23 feb 1997 23:07:16 from: faith subject: faith's delimma thanks, everyone, for some great ideas on how to deal with my husband on this.
the guy had a terrible "bedside manner," and i was so pissed off at his seeming disregard for what *i* needed that i didn't follow his advice.
he was concerned that she was pretty tight again, out of the blue.
but if she's really itchy the antihistimine doesn't do a thing--she'll still wake up all night.
but if i could have gotten over the hurt from his manner, and enlisted my husband's help in figuring out a new diet (instead of feeling defensive because he agreed with the guy's recommendation), it probably would have helped isaac.
sarna is an over-the-counter anti-itch lotion; it comes in an 8 oz. pump bottle and smells a bit medicinal, like ben-gay or something mentholated.
in all, it was a total of 9 days in a row of gradual improvement and great sleep.
i would put money on a bet that in the next twenty years, they will find that antibiotics and steroids contribute to the progression from eczema to athsma...
after sending my posting about ointments vs. creams, i got that uncertain feeling and went to check my elocon tube.
i would also recommend that when you clean him, clean him thoroughly.
it is just as soothing as aveeno and a lot less expensive.
wishing you all a day, like i had today, no itching (i got so much done!)date: 25 feb 1997 06:37:57 from: debi subject: kim/son infections i have read about the great success eczema sufferers have with the beach initially.
put him on a four-day rotation diet (only gets a particular food once every four days) from age 14 mos.
this is just as effective as the steroid.
when i got home last evening, brian looked so much better already.
we use topical steroid creams when he gets real bad only about once or twice every couple of weeks but they scare me.
since she was no where near raw/bleeding/oozing this time she's practically clear after only 2 days of no real itching.
if i hear from the lady, i'll relay.
he used to have eczema everywhere - special attention to diet seems to help the eczema on his face/body.
i have gotten many compliments from friends and family on the condition of my facial skin, my eyes (which were typically so bloodshot that it looked as if i had been on an extended bender) and the fact that i look rested.
i really want to avoid messing up her immune system even more and possibly contracting other auto-immune diseases.
doctors tell us that the cold shower closes the pores.
the condition of her spine always coincides with the state of her eczema.
there would't be any allergies, not many kids really have allergies.
very different from the fishy smell of the preparation h idea i got off this list.
i just went to the eye doctor last week and asked if there was any connection.
now it doesn't take a rocket scientist to at least suspect it.
if your eczema shows on the big day, you pin the wrap on with a brooch, if not, you just nonchalantly put it on and take it off as you wish.
i use desowen lotion often; supposedly it is one of the lowest potent steroids.
my dermatologist said to avoid tide.
i used to get eczema behind my knees, inside my elbows and on my neck only, now it can appear anywhere at all (except i never had the problem with my hands).
i find that the best thing for me from my wife is that she just accept that i am constantly in motion touching here and scratching there.
my son is still in diapers so i am looking to clean his clothes that aren't really dirty (after all it is winter, so he can't even find mud).
check out the ingredients of a lot of cremes and bath oils, the number one ingredient is mineral oil.
this book talks about the misalignment of the spine causing psoriasis and eczema problems.
date: 18 feb 1997 12:08:23 from: susan subject: a newcomer we think that isaac's eczema is related to allergies, but we have not been able to pin down exactly what he's sensitive to.
desowen lotion we use desonide cream on our 16 mo old son every now and then.
our building is 5 years old.
it is a lot cheaper than anything we've found in capsules, including borage oil (another source of gla).
i used to put on loads of moisturiser, but after a while i found it wasn't really necessary - i didn't dry out that much.
hello again i am finding all this very interesting because all these children sound just like my son daniel.
i am going to try head and shoulders first, since there is some of that in my bathroom already.
i developed eczema after taking an antibiotic.
sometimes when he is scratching alot i lay him across my lap and rub his back and down his legs.
that simple gesture means so much to me.
so far he's had rice cereal, bananas, green beans, corn (i think had a reaction), sweet potatoes, carrots, butternut squash (yuk!), and turkey (just tried this week).
i'd had gestational diabetes for the last 2 months of pregnancy, which i controlled with diet, not drugs, so i just couldn't get enough to eat.
as long as i don't rub too long or hard & irritate my skin it can actually make it feel soft (even normal sometimes).date: 27 feb 1997 11:19:25 from: alvaro subject:
the list of pollens, molds, foods, danders, etc. to which she has tested as severely allergic is mind-bending.
he will lay there as long as i want to rub.
then, i was taking cyclosporine for a year and wasn't itchy.
hello again i am finding all this very interesting because all these children sound just like my son daniel.
i was thinking of making a paste of zinc oxide and hypoallergenic brownish lipstick for covering the rash but my eczema has subsided so much that i don't even use much zinc oxide anymore.
the following week lets talk about ointments, creams, external aids.
i keep some in the refrigerator: the coolness on my skin is nice sometimes.
anyway, this weekend she was completely clear for the first time ever!!!!!
we had to pull him out of a group daycare setting because his skin got so bad there.
i am greatly impressed with your efforts, especially what you call "training" and "counseling".
and i think the evidence built up by all you good people out there will one day give us all the answer.
it is scented and full of those strange chemicals.
the other day my husband was in restaurant with daniel and a man gave him his card and recommended trying enzymes.
she has bowel movements 2-4 times a day, with her poo looking either soft-sausage-like or custard-like.
that simple gesture means so much to me.
i am throwing it out as i have not seen seafood being mentioned here.
then, i simply gorged on ice-cream, milk, and cheese.
therefore, he gave me an alcohol based steroid for the scalp (i think it was called textacort).
she used to warm it up, then rub it into my scalp, then leave it on for about an hour.
once we have the allergy testing done, i think/hope it will be very helpful in controlling his eczema (especially on his face).
as we all know, and you would think all doctors would know, we all react differently to things.
turns out she was allergic to that, too.
our dr. also says that e, allergies and asthma all go together.
the killer is that these things are available for sale widely and that you can't check people haven't got the other drugs it interacts with.
i myself do more damage with fabric than with short smooth fingernails.
i'd had gestational diabetes for the last 2 months of pregnancy, which i controlled with diet, not drugs, so i just couldn't get enough to eat.
this is expensive, but it's helped him, and we hope that eventually he'll be able to tolerate other environments more easily.
it has some interesting information about enzymes and their effect on allergies, also on enzyme therapy.
that i'm not yet sure about: my 12 month old, julia, was exactly like this (very bloody and oozy all over face) from 7 mos.
eventually, we'd get his attention, and then we could talk about the challenge at hand ("it looks like your blue truck is stuck under the couch... ".
from what i understand, leaky gut is an increase in intestinal permeability which results in toxins, antigens etc.
what that tells me is, if we don't come up with anything in this round of testing, i'll just have to drop the guy and move on to the next doctor, or naturopath, or whatever.
(i notice, with new understanding, how beautiful my mother looked in 1945 in her long-sleeved "old fashioned" gown!)
needless to say, i didn't get much sleep last night because after i went back to bed, i was just too upset!
i took cyclosporine because i too was going nowhere with steroids and couldn't get better.
it gives me hope that we can do something to break this cycle of scratching that our kids are just building now.
he didn't realize it but that made me even more self-conscious than i already am.
during the whole time when she was taking the decoction, no emollient was allowed.
(i no longer sleep with socks sewn to the ends of my pj's to keep from itching.
then, she had a viral attack.
i wouldn't be able to truck over there every 2 weeks.
even if you don't eat it, your body will make it from something else.
she seems to recover from the aveeno bath just today and i'm definitely not trying anything new on her for a while.
from: debi subject: e baby foods i have been fortunate to work with a nutritionist who has provided me with lists of foods to test.
