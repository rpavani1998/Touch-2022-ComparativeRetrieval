the above-mentioned successful cases indicate that traditional chinese medicine may deal with quite a wide range of health conditions, even for conditions that are not readily explained by theories of western medicine.as chinese herbal practitioners, we should be very careful in choosing quality chinese medicines because no matter how skillful a doctor is, it will be just one step short of success when poor quality herbs are used by mistake.to those who are afraid of certain treatment methods of western medicine, chinese medicine also offers an alternative treatment option.from my years of clinical experience on integrative medicine, i have got a deep understanding that both chinese medicines and western medicines have their advantages and shortcomings.as most hospitals in the usa do not integrate traditional chinese medicine in their programs, several years ago, i founded a clinic integrating tcm and western medicine outside our hospital, serving the need of those who believe in tcm and prefer to combine it with their western medicine treatment.some patients at their 40's or 50's often feel distress in chest, ecg examinations ordered by doctors of western medicine do not reveal any abnormity, thus a correct diagnosis cannot be reached.with the constant advance of modern technologies, i believe that chinese medicines will embrace new developments.we know that traditional herbal decoction pays particular attentions to compounding chinese herbs that play different roles as master, deputy, assistant, and envoy at doses adjusted to the condition of individual patients to achieve the desired outcome.with gui pi pian and xiao yao pian, i have successfully treated patients with symptoms of insomnia and dreaminess, which were caused by stress at work.by integrating them into treatments, we can make best use of the advantages and bypass the disadvantages.a patient was diagnosed to have lymph node enlargement and needed to do a biopsy.after they came to my clinic and were diagnosed with traditional chinese medicine, i found tongues of these patients were dark red and their hands and feet chilled, suggesting that their blood circulation is stagnated.this product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.the same chinese medicine of different brands can have great variance in quality.after another 3-6 treatment regimen, most of them were totally recovered from dysmenorrheal.
