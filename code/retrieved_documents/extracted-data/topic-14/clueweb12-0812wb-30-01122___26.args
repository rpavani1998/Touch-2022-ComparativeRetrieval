in the 1800s there were some top scientists (bechamp, virchow) who thought the internal milieu / environment was more important than the germs, and as long as it was in good nick the person had natural immunity.
what this tells us is that the integration of placebo (including psychological techniques and active listening) can be used to alleviate symptoms by altering perception of illness.
