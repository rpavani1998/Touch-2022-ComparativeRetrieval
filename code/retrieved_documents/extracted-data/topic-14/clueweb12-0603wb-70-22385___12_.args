the safety studies were designed to identify possible toxic effects, such as cancer-causing, reproductive, and neurological effects.as a board-certified internatl and endocrinologist, i have repeatedly found that aspartame products aggravate both diabetes control and its complications--and have written on this subject.the body weight gain issue impacts the establishment of a no effect or no adverse effect level and must, therefore, be evaluated closely.from its evaluation of the neotame database, the fda was able to conclude that neotame is safe for human consumption.moreover, phenylalamine concentrates much more on the fetal side of the placenta, and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier to affect the fetus brain.but after reviewing a large number of studies, the fda concluded it was safe and that further study wasn't needed.it is a free-flowing, water soluble, white crystalline powder that is heat stable and can be used as a tabletop sweetener as well as in cooking applications.contrary to the monsanto submission, i have considerable data that point toaspartame being toxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, diabetogenic and teratogenic.the agency said it concluded from the studies that neotame was safe for human consumption.concluding comments i am a totally corporate-neutral physician who is concerned about the ongoing exposure of the population to aspartame and numerous other chemicals that were approved without adequate long-term pertinent studies by corporate-neutral investigative and politically-neutral regulators.alan rulis, director of the fda's office of food-additive safety, said the fda found that there were no "risks or concerns" associated with neotame, and that it met the safety standards applied to all food additives.for example, these species metabolize phenylalamine 4-5 times faster than humans.in particular, the comments questioned the adequacy of the data in resolving issues regarding the body weight gain of test animals consuming neotame, and their reported food consumption values.let me repeat:it will be a public health tragedy if the aspartame problem is allowed to be repeated in the absence of these safeguards!because of neotame's strength -- it usually would take 8,000 teaspoons of sugar to equal the sweetening power of one teaspoon of neotame in most products -- mr. rosa said the "economic benefit is extraordinary" for makers of soft drinks and other products that use sugar substitutes.
