they have the distinct advantage of having few side effects when taken in a wide range of supplemental doses and are ideal for use as preventive agents in healthy populations.recent studies have shown that antioxidants may play a role in reducing the risk of cataracts, age-related macular degeneration, certain neurological disturbances, bladder cancer recurrence, and infectious diseases.for example, antibiotics have severely limited the threat of many childhood illnesses while surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy are used for treating many types of cancer, and open-heart surgery has saved the lives of many with crippling heart disease.the strength of naturopathic medicine lies in its ability to prevent illness and to treat illnesses that haven't responded well to conventional medical therapies.as the demand for nontoxic remedies for serious illnesses increases, naturopathic research is receiving more attention from mainstream medicine; allopathic researchers are beginning to research naturopathic remedies, thus providing the scientific data necessary to legitimize naturopathic medicine in the minds of those trained in western medical thought.as the role of nurses in the health care delivery process shifts from the traditional hospital setting to private practices, community and business organizations, and home health care, nurses will be in a position to educate the public about these complementary approaches to modern medicine.it may act as an antioxidant, useful in treating chronic hypertension, and aid in the reduction of serum cholesterol.oxygen therapies oxygen therapies alter the body's chemistry to help overcome disease, promote healing, and improve overall body function.when combined with guided imagery and/or therapeutic touch, it can be a powerful nursing intervention in a wide variety of nursing settings such as nursing homes, hospices, and hospitals; and for a wide variety of illnesses such as the side-effects of chemotherapy and radiation in treating cancer patients, aids related problems, heart disease, postpartum depression, and anxiety of new mothers.a major advantage homeopathy has over conventional medicine is it uses substances in such small amounts to effect a cure, that there are virtually no side effects.the use of antioxidants to prevent and treat heart disease has been an important part of research from earlier findings suggesting that the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is critical in the development of arteriosclerosis.oxygen therapies alter the body's chemistry to help overcome disease, promote healing, and improve overall body function.chiropractic medicine's greatest strength lies in its treatment of musculoskeletal problems such as sprains, low back problems, headaches, neck stiffness, and joint conditions.once the person has recovered from the precipitating symptoms, a constitutional remedy may be given to increase the body's resistance to developing future symptoms.when replaced, it can have dramatic effects on the body's metabolic rates and change the muscle/fat ratio, accelerate the healing process in surgical patients, and help people sleep better.
