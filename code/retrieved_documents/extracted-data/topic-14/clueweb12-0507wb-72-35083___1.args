i hated their silly remarks as if i was wearing what the belly dancers wore and not a normal jeans and shirt.
no need to put make-up or do my hair or pay too much attention to my looks.
a group of at least 15 young men blocked our way in a busy main road that was well lit.
we found ourselves encircled in fury of holding, touching, groping, and probing accompanied by dirty words and vulgar language describing what each one of them was doing or wanted to do to us.
the strange thing is that there were a lot of people on the street that saw the act but walked on minding their own business.
i changed the way i dress, and i neglected the way i look, yet i started to be experience a new type of harassment.

it was the first time i was touched in those parts of my body, and the first time i heard the words that were spoken, which i never imagined would ever be said to me.
i got scared of walking on the streets and started making rules on what i should and shouldnt do to protect myself from their hungry eyes and hungry hands.

yes, cairo is bigger and the peasants are less and the harassments are less.
i will not forget the first time this happened when i was walking on the street on eid as well.
all the men around him would have the same reaction as if i was crazy and nothing happened.
no going out at all in the streets where the youth hang out for hours, which are well known in my small town.
what was strange was that some of it was worse than before, but i didn’t give up.
i won’t be touched in every street but i can buy a 150le ticket for live western band, meaning the people are mostly well-off and educated, and still get harassed by large numbers as if there was an implied agreement between the youth to do so.
so it wasn’t just for the sake of it, and it might have been all because i am not ugly.
so i shouldn’t really take my liberty in wearing what i want as every place has it’s stature.
my only experience of this is weak and superficial gentlemanliness that was mostly closer to flirting than anything else.
the stray dogs and cats walk go on the streets with no trouble!
i grew older and body changed, but i always thought that it was a good thing not something to be ashamed of ,or a source of harassment that my young mind and life-loving heart did not comprehend.

posted by kirsten n. namskau thursday, november 16, 2006 i have borrowed this from the blogg of “mechanical crowds” http://mechanicalcrowds.blogspot.com/ this woman gives the western world, by her story, the reason for why some women in the arab world prefer to use hijab, veil, burka … call it what you want, but they want to cover, so no one can see if the person under is a young beautiful darling or an old, dirty, tooth-less grandma.

(is that a crime???)anyways, i never thought i would ever see a day worse than this, or get harassed any more awful than this.

it’s enough that i used taxis to go to my friends’ houses or any other closed place.
what was strange was that some of it was worse than before, but i didnt give up.
after a short time, these harassments started repeating again: an animal on a bike would touch me from behind and sometimes the front as he quickly goes by, very dirty looks from shopkeepers, taxi drivers, and neighbors.

i dont even need to go on the street, as its no longer the place for people who want to maintain their self-respect.

i am from zaqaziq, and until recently i thought that i was one of the few people who went through unusual personal experiences of sexual harassment, which i suffered from since i was little .

i would feel a touch in a sensitive area and turn to that direction to shout and fight but find a very cool and innocent response from the man.

i change my spot but another animal or animals would harass me in the same way as if its a group sex party not a concert.
