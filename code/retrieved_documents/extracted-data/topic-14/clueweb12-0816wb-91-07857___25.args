preparations of the plant artemisia annua are effective in treating malaria, but the active ingredient artemisinin can vary wildly from preparation to preparation, meaning some preparations will be ineffective and some will have far more side effects (this is true of all herbal preparations that actually do something, like preparations of st. johns wort).
in the best case (most cases) the treatment will be completely ineffective and you will have just done your money.
then it becomes a pharmaceutical, but it's available to everyone, the dose is known, and it is free from other plant impurities that might impede the effect or cause other harmful effects.
