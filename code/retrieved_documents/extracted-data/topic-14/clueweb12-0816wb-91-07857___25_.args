the reason we practice medicine in whatever form or research in medically related fields, should be to relieve human suffering by providing relief of disease and its symptoms by using a method that is most effective, least invasive, most humane, cost effective and producing the least unwanted side effects.research also suggests that cam education may also teach practitioners greaterself-awareness, improved core competencies (such as evidence-based practice), enhanced cultural competency andpatient-centred care.western medicine is responsible for hundreds of thousands of iatrogenic injuries and deaths per year while cam is only implicated in a handful.thereâ€™s clinical evidence for acupuncture as effective treatment for various conditions, includingmigraines, tension-type headaches and chronic low-back pain.herbal medicines with efficacy have exactly the same types of side effects and adverse event issues as do conventional medicine.the training also encouraged students to look at and evaluate evidence and make informed decisions in the best interests of their patients.of all the medical specialties, anaesthesia would be amongst the best documented as far as its physiology and pharmacology.science-based therapy doesn't just mean that the effectiveness should be proven scientifically - it means that the therapy should be based on the clinical sciences - the way we know the body works.crushing up herbs and giving them to people is a primitive form of medicine - we have progressed to the point where we can synthesise the active chemicals, thus avoiding potential side effects and interactions associated with giving people a whole natural product, which may contain hundreds of chemicals.the intricacies of individualised herbal remedies for a single disease also cannot be tested in a scientific trial adequately.it is a dangerous practice because it deters people from seeking proper treatment and management of their condition.cam looks particularly safe when compared to some of the iatrogenic and sometimes fatal effects of pharmaceutical and biomedical treatments (last i read about this, only a few years back, this contributed to around 18,000 australian deaths each year).neither medicine has all the answers and neither should they claim too, the community will make their own decision in the long run as to which modality of medicine they choose to put their faith and dollars into, we should definitely encourage medicine research in both areas through increased availability of university course to improve the health of everyone.to be able to do that, health professionals need to be knowledgeable, at least, about the principle, paradigm and available evidence for all complementary medicines, includinghomeopathic and traditional medicines.nevertheless, it is actually very scientific, and, within its own body of knowledge, homeopathic remedies have been extensively tested and proven.
