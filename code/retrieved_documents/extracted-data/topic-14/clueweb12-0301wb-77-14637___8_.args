some medical practitioners, such as md, do, chiropractors and others, are not required to fulfill the complete educational and clinical requirements of a licensed acupuncturist, yet they may still be allowed to practice acupuncture.good health results when qi flows freely along the meridians; disease develops where qi is deficient or blocked.the patient-practitioner relationship is an extremely subtle thing and all practitioners are responsible for creating a relationship that promotes healing.the treatment is working if you get better, ie, your symptoms subside either within 24 hours or within a reasonable time period relative to the length of time you’ve had the disorder and relative to your general health.this does not mean you should never schedule with someone less experienced, especially if they come well-recommended or are very accessible, but give new practitioners extra scrutiny.in some ways choosing an acupuncturist is just like choosing any kind of holistic health practitioner.acupuncturists often treat more than one person at a time, using several rooms so they can interview one person while another patient “cooks.”an acupuncturist will form a diagnosis by taking a health history, including asking why you are there, looking at your tongue, taking your six pulses, and maybe pressing on your abdomen.this is the “acupuncture nap” that patients look forward to, from which they awake feeling refreshed and invigorated.depending upon the seriousness of your condition — acute or chronic — for the best and longest lasting results, expect to return for a series of visits.treatments focus mainly on points above the neck and below the elbows and knees so no clothing removal is required.hopefully this acupuncture information is helpful in guiding you along the next steps of your holistic healing journey.if knotted, their qi has become smooth; if deficient, it has become ample and good health will follow.one of the reasons acupuncturists vary so greatly in how they practice is because asia is big.the same is true for adding any adjunct natural healing modalities of acupuncture such as cupping,gwa sha, herbal teas, nutritional supplements, bodywork, healing touch, moxa, etc.
