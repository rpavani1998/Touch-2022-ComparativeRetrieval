the optimal synthesis of traditional chinese herbology with western medicine and science entails using traditional chinese methods for describing whole-body patterns of symptoms and clinical signs and to incorporate knowledge from modern nutrition, biochemistry, pharmacology, microbiology, and pathology as means offine-tuning the choice of herbs, formulas, dietary recommendations, and other therapies.it is also evident that a growing portion of western herbalists have become receptive to chinese herbology as they recognize it has the potential to fill in a major gap in their own techniques mainly in clinical assessment.it is also evident that a growing portion of western herbalists have become receptive to chinese herbology as they recognize it has the potential to fill in a major gap in their own techniques â€” mainly in clinical assessment.there is a vast amount of research proving beyond any doubt that music has powerful and often rapid effects on measurable physiological parameters, both positive and negative: eeg patterns, hormone levels, heart rate, even the growth pattern of neurons and dendritic branching patterns in the brain.as traditional chinese herbology is a descriptive, phenomenological system, its insights remain valid regardless of advances in scientific materialism (materialistic causality).as traditional chinese herbology has become popularized worldwide, the dominant culture of scientific materialism applies political and economic coercion to "biomedicalize" and "scientize" it, to make it more amenable to profit-making schemes.summary the optimal synthesis of traditional chinese herbology with western medicine and science entails using traditional chinese methods for describing whole-body patterns of symptoms and clinical signs and to incorporate knowledge from modern nutrition, biochemistry, pharmacology, microbiology, and pathology as means offine-tuning the choice of herbs, formulas, dietary recommendations, and other therapies.the whole ecology and permaculture movement in the u.s. is a more compatible fit with the sensibilities of most american natural health patrons, and it makes sense to integrate this into a comprehensive herbal tradition rather than to be dependent exclusively on imported herbs.the naturopathic and alternative health community has made many interesting and very likely effective improvements for dealing with cancer.while tcm doctors give lip service to the idea of good diet, ayurvedic doctors place much greater emphasis on diet, and this aspect is certainly important in dealing with american clients whose diets are typically disastrous.however, western scientific knowledge of herbal pharmacology and toxicology has definitely added a useful layer of understanding.traditional chinese herbology, ayurveda, western herbology, and allopathic medicine are each characterized by sets of terminology and rules of logical deduction for which one-to-one correspondences are not easily described.this could give western herbalists a head start in figuring out how to use these herbs in a more precisely targeted manner.instead of rote memorization, since 1998 we at rmhi have developed interactive computer game software to help students learn basic theory and data: computer-aided instruction in tcm clinical analysis and decision-making skills since i'd estimate that 70-80% of all illnesses in america are due to diet and environmental factors, it is important to keep up with the latest discoveries in nutritional sciences and environmental health issues.in this aspect, many western herbal teachers are already doing a lot of things right: taste-testing the herbs in one's materia medica, keeping journals of one's subjective experiences, discussing case studies as a way to illustrate techniques and improve clinical skills.
