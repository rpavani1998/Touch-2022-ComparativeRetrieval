they are willing to train the right candidate but would prefer someone with at least an academic understanding of biological medicine and functional medicine principles and a sincerely demonstrated interest in alternative approaches to the treatment of chronic disease.it has also been shown in the laboratory to prevent the growth of new blood vessels needed for tumors to grow, kill mouse, rat, and human cancer cells, and protect the dna in white blood cells, including cells that have been exposed to dna-damaging chemotherapy drugs.extracts of mistletoe have been shown to kill cancer cells in the laboratory and to boost the immune system and for this reason, it has been classified as a type of biological response modifier.they also provide adjunctive cancer support by integrating state-of-the-art dental, medical and detoxification protocols that remove obstacles to cure and activate the natural healing intelligence inherent in us all.this breakthrough report affirmed that homeopathic treatment is both effective and cost-effective and that homeopathic treatment should be reimbursed by switzerland's national health insurance program.the swiss report found a particularly strong body of evidence to support the homeopathic treatment of upper respiratory tract infections and respiratory allergies.further, six out of seven controlled studies that compared homeopathic treatment with conventional medical treatment showed that homeopathy to be more effective than conventional medical interventions (the one other trial found homeopathic treatment to be equivalent to conventional medical treatment).their clinical staff works collaboratively and consists of medical and naturopathic doctors, holistic dentists, a nurse practitioner, acupuncturists, massage therapists and colon hydrotherapists.in my view, for a treatment to be determined to be "effective" or "scientifically proven," a much more comprehensive assessment of what works and doesn't is required.to make this assertion, one would have to acknowledge that virtually all surgical procedures were "unscientific" or "unproven" because so few have undergone randomized double-blind trials.ultimately, the swiss government's report on homeopathy represents an evaluation of homeopathy that included an assessment of randomized double blind trials as well as other bodies of evidence, all of which together lead the report to determine that homeopathic medicines are indeed effective.not only did this report carefully and comprehensively review the body of evidence from randomized double-blind and placebo controlled clinical trials testing homeopathic medicines, they also evaluated the "real world effectiveness" as well as safety and cost-effectiveness.all of these results from homeopathic treatment came without the side effects common to conventional drug treatment.after assessing pre-clinical basic research and the high quality clinical studies, the swiss report affirmed that homeopathic high-potencies seem to induce regulatory effects (e.g., balancing or normalizing effects) and specific changes in cells or living organisms.the swiss report also notes that david sackett, m.d., the canadian physician who is widely considered to be one of the leading pioneers in "evidence based medicine," has expressed serious concern about those researchers and physicians who consider randomized and double-blind trials as the only means to determine whether a treatment is effective or not.
