integrative medicine is very important, vital to the future of health care in the us.as americans we need to look at the long term consequences of our behaviors, and we need a health care system that truly teaches us signs and symptoms of the beginnings of ill health so we can stop the progression of disease and debility.i encourage you to also look at music therapy as it is based on very sound scientific data, now increasingly focused on the effects of music on brain functions, and is used very effectively in obstetrics, oncology, surgery, hemodialysis, pediatrics, neurology, immunology, psychiatry, and for treating autism, aphasia, dementia, and a wide variety of developmental disabilities.patients are taught to meditate to reduce stress and encouraged to eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, soy, olive oil, cold-water fish, and dark-colored berries for heart health.with fundamental changes to the nation’s health care delivery system recently passed into law, integrative medicine may well get increased attention.a public health intervention designed to reduce salt consumption by 1,200 milligrams — or about two-thirds of a teaspoon — a day, could nearly cut in half the number of new cases of heart disease, stroke, and heart attack.they include an emphasis on prevention, and on standards of evidence that will allow alternative therapies to be evaluated head-to-head with conventional therapies.another service offered by the integrative medicine clinics is acupuncture, which is designed to stimulate the natural healing processes of the body and is used to treat problems such as stress, nausea, pain, and other conditions.while the american cancer society says there’s no proof that guided imagery influences the progress of cancer, the acs web site does cite evidence that the technique can reduce stress, anxiety, and pain and lessen some of the side effects of chemotherapy, such as nausea and vomiting.the human brain is prone to all kinds of irrational processes, and the best way to ensure we are not wrongly influenced by them is to subject our theories to the scientific process.i think one of the biggest benefits of many alternative treatments is the fact that they work with your body and the natural processes that are already taking place.these medications and treatments focused on a singular part of my health and instead of working with my body to heal itself they were in a constant battle with what my body was naturally trying to do.while a physician may lead the medical team, the workload is shared among various professionals, and the patient ends up getting more time devoted to health education, disease prevention, and chronic disease control.there is no evidence to support the various treatments identified here, like acupuncture and healing touch, as offering anything beyond placebo.often, patients who come to the clinics are facing difficult chronic diseases and complicated tangles of symptoms.
