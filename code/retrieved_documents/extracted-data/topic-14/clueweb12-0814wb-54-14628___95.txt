dr. moran’sresponse, thoughtful and provocative as always, was  buried in the midst of other commenters’ tangential arguments about the  theory of evolution.
the main  difference would be in the emphasis of argument and some of the rhetoric.
in fact, ka elsewhere is arguing the reverse, that while cam may be offering placebo and other non-specific medical benefits these can equally well occur within the 5-15 minute hurly-burly of the typical present day medical practice, i am sure they can, with good doctors, but i would love to be quite sure about the “equally”.
i suppose that describing someone’s lack of knowledge of science-based medicine, or belief in shamanism, as ‘primitive’ might be acceptable, although i still think a better choice of words might be ‘non-scientific belief system’ or some such, as clunky as that is.
i am talking about feelings and perceptions here, things i get the impression skeptics have difficulty dealing with, things i think have to be used to communicate with the general public.
mental states affect physical states and physical states affect mental states.
there were articles praising his products in the lancet and the british medical j among others by several different doctors.
they know what we mean  when we write “woo,” and they ought to feel the sting of the  insult.
isn’t honey a potential source for botulinum spores?
why should honesty and integrity be so difficult?
i assume that homeopathy is traditional in many european countries like  germany, france, belgium and england where even the queen is said to carry her  little black box of homeo “remedies” when she travels.
# daijiyobu on 01 aug 2008 at 2:30 pm dr. a. quoted: “the holistic medical movement constitutes both a deliberate attempt  to substitute a magical for an engineering conception of the physical and an  attack on scientific understanding and reasoning
dr. moran also added another comment, reproduced in part here: the ethical objection to all use of cam, as presented by ka, is problematic because of the unspoken assumptions – 1.
like my doctor, he believed them and never tried to verify their claims.
yes, that’s what i was going for – the similarity in  emotional/cultural roles.
the principles governing scientific reasoning and belief are negative as well as positive, and they imply that occult doctrines are not worthy of belief.
i think that one of the down-sides to playing shaman and giving a placebo is that true alternatives such as psychotherapy or a good exercise program are missed and the person then ends up remaining tired and dragged out rather than making the life-style changes that they need or participating in evidence-based cognitive-behavioural therapy.
these days such studies even often include quality-adjusted life year (qaly) measurements so that all aspects of patient life can bear upon a precise, measurement-based, final judgment.
is the resort to ethical argument about the use of placebo medicines a lazy way of justifying such a globally rigid approach?
when discussing quackery, i hate the skeptic’s use of the word woo because i think that the people you should be trying to reach don’t understand it and when they do they will think you are talking down your noses at them.
shamans derive  their influence from playing, in essence, the same role as ministers or priests  in their society.
it keeps you from understanding the depth of the problem and all the forces involved.
we have to know why people are using silly therapies… do we?
# rjstan@together.net on 01 aug 2008 at 6:45 pm dr. a, “those in our culture, with occasional exceptions, were not  brought up to believe in “cam.”
most of them are vacuous; they are banalities of orthodox medicine, or they have no medical content and no applicability to any possible practice of medicine; they merely sound nice.
dr. hall, “someone needs to investigate these psychological factors, but a gullible believer in woo like dr. oz is not the one to do it.”
i laugh at most of it, but i don’t laugh at fraud.
if having a room smell of lavender and bergamot oil makes you calm (smell is very closely tied to emotion), wouldn’t it be better than having you stressed out by the hospital environment?
in part, a banal rhetoric about the physician as consoler;… in part, familiar and rather useless admonitions about not overlooking the abundance of circumstances that may contribute to one condition or another.
if an md agreed to a tribesman’s request for a witch doctor, and the witch doctor’s role was just to assuage the tribesman’s fears, isn’t that equivalent to having the hospital chaplain stop by to comfort a seriously ill patient?
i use “woo” as  a shorthand for implausible medical claims (imc).
a physician engineer cannot honestly claim powers of  magic or occult knowledge.
following on from that — what is the evidence-based answer to non-specific tiredness and unhappiness?
i think for many people living today psychotherapy replaced religion but it didn’t help many with their psychological and emotional needs and now many are looking to medicine to do that, and of course, they will be disappointed again.
supplements are not the only part of cam but they are the common  denominator, the fuel that runs the industry, the billion $$ money maker.
popular bookstores are filled with works on “holistic medicine,” many edited by medical doctors and some recommended by such political eminences as edward kennedy and george mcgovern.
i am glad that dr. moran has described his views on this topic as “tentative positions that i am exploring.”
but if a physician’s quest to elicit  a placebo effect from an implausible treatment means pretending that the  treatment has some other effect, specific to the patient’s  problem, then that is a lie.
engineers need not care in principle whether the generalizations on which they rely are psychological, physical, or psychophysical; what they care about is that the generalizations be applicable and that their reliability be scientifically demonstrated.
i do not write about religious beliefs, for example.
am i for or against oz bringing a “healer” into the or?
if physicians were more attentive to science and ethics and to explaining things to patients, politicians, and the media, more people would know that.
surveys  routinely show that the majority of cam-using patients express great  satisfaction with them.
i reject, as i hope i made clear above, the false dichotomy that for each health problem there is either a proven treatment or there is “cam.”
most people believe that americans are over regulated so  that when homeo products are sold in pharmacies and stores next to the otcs,  they assume they are the same when that isn’t true.
yet i have suggested that healthfrauders routinely exaggerate the risks of cam, that some potential dangers are not realized much in practice, and it again needs to be said that the medical risks depend very much upon the specific “quack” claim.
as a patient, i have experienced two memorable examples of what i think of  as “placebo effects.”
i countered with my own opinion that honesty and integrity are necessary parts of any discussion with a patient, and that they, in turn, must not conflict with science and reason.
if  you are about to have major surgery, you may acquiesce to anything you think  the surgeon approves of.
i was  quite struck by them, for i have had very similar personal experiences and  observed them in many patients.
they were  fraudulent.
the  refusal of some physicians and patients to accept that truth is, in my  opinion, an important basis for a “cam” subset, “ fad diagnoses” (perhaps a topic for another time).
but if a physician’s quest to elicit a placebo effect from an implausible treatment means pretending that the treatment has some other effect, specific to the patient’s problem, then that is a lie.
modern medicine does no such thing, and could not even if it wanted to, since descartes held no such view.
if you are saying that you don’t think that the majority of people  are using cam treatments, are you saying that you don’t consider  “dietary supplements” cam?
am i the only one who thinks that when exposing quackery you should give a  lot more weight and spend a lot more time and effort on fraudulent, made up,  deliberately invented reports of benefits than on things as utterly silly as  with wacky people, often very nice wacky people telling others to drink  something to cure a disease like aids because there is one study that showed it  worked as a preservative, or because the fairies told you that it worked or  maybe the stars indicate that it does?
certainly, many people seem to think so.
ka # hermano on 03 aug 2008 at 9:39 pm dr. moran is indeed “muy simpático”.
we  would still be able to describe hulda clark as a dangerous and severely deluded  cancer quack, or, if you prefer, an unspeakable criminal fraud.
he made motz  part of his team and allowed her to introduce a macrobiotic diet, acupuncture,  hypnosis, aromatherapy, changing light from fluorescent to incandescent, and  cleaning the floors only with natural cleansers.
i’ll try and find a better word than “primitive” but just about any word i can think of seems likely to be regarded as pejorative by those who see much to prize in the medical beliefs of ancient cultures.
it is lying to make a buck.
most people believe that americans are over regulated so that when homeo products are sold in pharmacies and stores next to the otcs, they assume they are the same when that isn’t true.
[...] # science-based medicine » does alternative medicine have  alternative ethics?
a huge part of it is fraud.
they can explain that they contain nothing but water, alcohol or sugar till the  cows come home, but there will still be many people who will believe that they  work and will want to buy them.
another doctrine said to be holistic is that one’s state of health is affected by everything.
i had to write mine piecemeal, and couldn’t look to see if you had answered without losing mine.
what this adds up to is that the public may not be (generally) as  indiscriminate in their use of alternative methods and as in need of protection  from unscientific concepts as we healthfrauders like to think.
they can explain that they contain nothing but water, alcohol or sugar till the cows come home, but there will still be many people who will believe that they work and will want to buy them.
that’s why i write what i write; i, like every other activist, make the contribution that i’m good at making.

in the us almost no  one heard of homeopathy until a few years ago and very few now know the  theories behind it.
(as an atheist, i don’t personally find any of those beliefs any more credible than any other, but that’s unrelated to the point i wanted to make.)
not so, apparently, when it comes to  cam..
the new england journal of medicine  disappoints on 22 aug 2008 at 8:00 am [...] it published the best article about pseudomedicine ever to appear in  a mainstream journal, which i quoted extensively a couple of weeks ago (if i  were king, that article would be reprinted each year or so).
he credits the photos and the information to the crookes laboratory.
this is the very reason why i have an interest in examining the kind of messages we are putting out.
(this month the hospital announced that it  was seeking a merger with another hospital to help ease its growing financial  difficulties.)
do you actually know this is true in the various european cultures dr. moran referred to?
i agree that this is an important issue.
i was the victim of the drug company that  published fraudulent ads.
in fact, at least one medical ethicist has gone so far as to state that  it is not unethical for a doctor to prescribe a placebo treatment, so long as  the doctor believes it will benefit the patient.
i have previously asked this question which has to do with public policy in relation to safe “alternatives”.
-this is an interesting ethical debate  within the medical community worth checking out.
it is a waste of time talking ethics to  those who don’t share quite the same scientific convictions, and that  applies to almost everyone.
i don’t mean to suggest that religion is equivalent to shamanism,  only that the md is responding to the patient’s request for  psycological/spiritual/cultural support from someone the patient trusts.
sure, on its face it makes sense to use  something that works without regard to why it works, but that’s a  deceptive way to look at what oz, an enthusiastic big kid with a solid  background in cardiac surgery but none in critical thinking, is doing:  “return[ing] the practice of medicine to the practice of magic  and…replac[ing] logic and method with occultism and obfuscation.”
we would still be able to describe hulda clark as a dangerous and severely deluded cancer quack, or, if you prefer, an unspeakable criminal fraud.
[...it's] a reactionary impetus to return the practice of medicine to the practice of magic and to replace logic and method with occultism and obfuscation.”
not so, apparently, when it comes to cam..
it would be nice to be able to convince large numbers of people to stop using silly therapies, but that’s a tall order.
the cam stuff i subscribe to is that which falls under the range of  “scientifically possible, though not yet proven”.
many of the commenters enthused about the possibilities of placebo but demurred at the ethics of using it.
(as an atheist, i don’t personally find any of those beliefs  any more credible than any other, but that’s unrelated to the point i  wanted to make.)
colloidal silver, by no stretch of the imagination a dietary supplement, is also both woo and fraud.
it need  not be introduced in an unjustified or insulting way, i.e., by implying that  the patient’s symptoms are “all in her head” or are  “functional” or whatever.
and it’s not the part that i, for one, either know much about or can do much about.”
and i see several shades of gray in between.
i will try instead to move  discussion on.
it might even happen.
because many patients become the victims of quackery does not negate the fact that the epidemic of cam we are now experiencing started with the general public and worked its way up to scientific institutions.
all the studies i’ve seen show that a huge number of people is spending a huge amount of money on supplements which they believe or hope offer health benefits.
you are very rational.
it’s all one, if it is seen to be “alternative”.
the mere fact that holistic medicine is widespread and enduring is no reason to take its claims seriously; superstition, self-deception, stupidity, and fraud are ubiquitous and always have been.
if i were he, my greatest concern would be that rational patients would  think that he was as wacky as motz sounds.
ka # harriet hall on 02 aug 2008 at 9:58 pm rjstan said, “i don’t think he should be asked to do research  certainly not on the outcomes of psychological interventions. ”
other than  that it is as timely now as it was then, and is also pertinent to  much of the discussion here (note to dr. moran: this is no  longer directed at you; i know that you are aware of these  things).
# kimball atwood on 02 aug 2008 at 10:37 pm rosemary, once again we are cross-posting, but no matter.
“dr. a, “there are plenty of modern physicians whose patients  are not disposed to look elsewhere” if that were true, there wouldn’t be a billion $$ supplement  industry.
she laughed and said, “they all do that.”
if you don’t care, if it  really is woo that you want to focus on, that is your privilege, but i  personally am concerned about the bigger picture, about nonsense being served  up and charged for in scientific institutions as if it were supported by solid  evidence as well as about the terrific harm snake oil does to real people.
ka in julie motz’s book she says oz credited her with the success when a transplanted heart started beating, saying he didn’t know what she did in there, but he’d never seen a heart come back so fast.
we are also fairly obviously more deeply offended by it than most, which can lead to confirmation bias.
one of the larger books of this kind was even subsidized by the  national institute of mental health.
depression, for  instance, has emerged as one of the major risk factors in the recovery of heart  patients after surgery.
mental states affect physical states  and physical states affect mental states.
even in this heyday of cam, very few of the public  use cam exclusively.
i hope you’ll agree  with me that describing a person as ‘primitive’ (or  ‘advanced’, for that matter) is not a medical or scientific  judgment, but a value judgment.
an example is studies designed to determine the optimum dose of a noxious chemotherapeutic agent, so that cancer remissions are produced at acceptable risk.
if homeo “remedies” are traditional there, i assume the public knows the theory behind them.
in that case, wouldn’t he have a duty to advise against it?
that’s to give you some idea of the kind of thing that i am on about.
(i am not going to get into the value or  ethics of this here.
that should answer both your questions.
i agree that people can do what they want.
david gorski wrote: actually, religion is more or less equivalent to shamanism.
yet today’s silver quacks are still citing the  old quack articles.
until you understand the general public and  speak their language you will not be able to educate them or do much to stop  cam from taking over the world.
this applies fairly well to some illnesses but not many others.
if by that  you mean that you think that all cam is irrational, you are wrong.
and it’s not the part  that i, for one, either know much about or can do much about.
# rjstan@together.net on 01 aug 2008 at 5:45 pm in 1995 i read the following article in the ny times.
if you don’t care, if it really is woo that you want to focus on,  that is your privilege, but i personally am concerned about the bigger picture,  about nonsense being served up and charged for in scientific institutions as if  it were supported by solid evidence as well as about the terrific harm snake  oil does to real people.
they were fraudulent.
they’ll tend to be  more knowledgable on average than the tribesman, but it’s a difference of  degree, not kind.
* i  added passages from a couple of key medical ethics treatises to support my  assertion.
ka seems to help my argument with personal medical experiences that are  reminiscent of some of stories of “alternative” testimonial.
you said, “i think that “cam” is woo.”
regarding points 2 and 3, i agree that the only  “value” of almost all “cam” treatments is in their  “placebo effects.”
depending on the circumstances, it may or may not  be appropriate for the md to tell the tribesman/patient that the  potion/homeopathy is almost certainly worthless.
just as he would have a duty to advise against going to a laetrile clinic.
i got a copy of his book which looks to me like a reputable textbook on colloid  chemistry published in 1938.
dr ben goldacre’s placebo series on bbc radio 4, part 2 and part 1  touched on this issue but didn’t explore it.
in the us almost no one heard of homeopathy until a few years ago and very few now know the theories behind it.
the holistic practitioner sees the body in much the same way that magicians of old viewed the universe.
am i misunderstanding what you say?
that expression clearly originated as an attempt to bring an extremely effective approach to medicine down to the same level as a pack of others that have been tried throughout the history of mankind.
so far, i’ve seen nothing to justify  such a lie.
sure, some of his clients may eventually realize that he is actually a nutcase, but even most of those will probably find ways in which they think he has helped them.
what if the md thinks the witch doctor’s potion is potentially  harmful?
the practice of medicine in the united states and in other industrialized nations is a form of consultant engineering.
moreover, physician engineers have no immunity to  moral or ethical constraints.
if he wants to test the hypothesis that emotional and psychological factors  affect the outcome of surgery, then he should test that hypothesis, not bring a  ditzy magical thinker into the operating room to violate the privacy of the  patient and to distract and embarrass the many other practitioners involved (if  i were an anesthesiologist in such a situation, i’d refuse if asked and  i’d be livid if i hadn’t been asked).
the only real reason i can see for treating the witch doctor/tribesman situation differently is that the tribesman’s knowledge may be more limited.
the most  important elements are that the practitioner be attentive and appear to give a  damn.
sure, they have  money, but so does “big tobacco.”
if you don’t care, if it really is woo that you want to focus on, that is your privilege, but i personally am concerned about the bigger picture, about nonsense being served up and charged for in scientific institutions as if it were supported by solid evidence as well as about the terrific harm snake oil does to real people.
imo, claiming that scientific medicine is the sole province of white males and the west is about as prejudiced as you can get since it implies that the rest of us are too dumb to recognize and embrace the great benefits scientific medicine has offered the world and the great promise it still offers it.
imo, the only way that we can really have a major impact and protect the public is to have many people actually learn enough about supplements to recognize fraud when it occurs and expose it.
there is a whole segment of the media that  has fed them that for decades.
i realize that that may sound contradictory to you, but it isn’t to  me.
many were injured by supplements they bought after reading fraudulent ads.
the reason is that it really doesn’t discriminate if you remember that till not much more than 100 years ago everyone including all the ancestors of everyone living today used primitive or pre-scientific medicine and crude non-standardized remedies, some of which were utterly useless, some dangerous and some just very unreliable.
# harriet hall on 01 aug 2008 at 6:14 pm the book “hands of life” describes how intuitive energy healer  julie motz was accepted into dr. oz’s operating rooms as part of his  cardiac surgery team.
the “general public” is not synonymous with  “patients,” even if the latter are drawn from the former, but
“dr. a, “there are plenty of modern physicians whose patients are not disposed to look elsewhere” if that were true, there wouldn’t be a billion $$ supplement industry.
# zetetic on 04 aug 2008 at 12:39 pm honey on cuts?
maybe we skeptics encounter a disproportionate amount of the dangerous and nutty extremes of “alternative” medicine because we go looking for it and we hang about on forums that gather it.
he was definitely naive in that he believed the ads in  an era when drug companies were not strictly regulated, but according to my  definition, he was not a quack.
the most compelling, in my opinion, is his point about “calling in witch doctors.”
we normally try to  quantify them so that we can reach a reasonable balance.
we have to know why people are using silly  therapies and the reasons are many.
however, holistic medicine is not a scientific tradition.
woo and fraud are not mutually exclusive.
an example is studies  designed to determine the optimum dose of a noxious chemotherapeutic agent, so  that cancer remissions are produced at acceptable risk.
if physicians learn relatively fewer generalizations that are entirely psychological or social in nature or that posit psychological mechanisms for physical effects, the reason is not that such generalizations are alien to the “medical model” but that relatively few of them are applicable and scientifically warranted.
# rjstan@together.net on 02 aug 2008 at 8:22 pm dr. atwood, perhaps i sound contradictory because you see things as black  or white
we are also fairly obviously more  deeply offended by it than most, which can lead to confirmation bias.
that is the whole point of these posts, and why i disagree with dr. moran that even a little “cam” is harmless.
a great deal of what physicians learn consists of biologic and  biochemical generalizations, broadly construed, but they also learn a  substantial body of psychophysical generalizations which can be regarded as  bridging the crevasse between mind and body.
and it’s not a matter of patients asking for woo; the energy healer is officially part of dr. oz’s team: surely that influences patients.
it’s true  that there are many examples where ethical absolutes don’t seem to  apply very well.
on the other hand, being happy is a major component of  recovery–i’ve lapsed on my reading on how the nervous system  affects the immune system, but as of 2005 (the last year that i followed this  closely) the studies seemed to to be pointing towards stress actually lowering  immune cell counts and other objective measurements of immune function.
perhaps it is those who think medicine is collapsing into a sea of “woo” despite their best efforts so far who should be rechecking whether their understanding of the world of medicine is anything more than an adequate first approximation.
where does the placebo complex of influences fit in?
i could give you many more examples, but will limit myself to one more often offered as a reference by today’s silver quacks, robert j. harman.
ok, but if he’s not going to do research and is not using any control  group, he has no right to make the claims he is making for the efficacy of the  woo.
that science provides a clear discrimination between what works and what  doesn’t.
it contains  pictures of the petri dishes that look just like those crookes showed in his  articles because they are.
maybe we  skeptics encounter a disproportionate amount of the dangerous and nutty  extremes of “alternative” medicine because we go looking for it and  we hang about on forums that gather it.
and light can affect a person’s mood, too.
maybe so, but what’s your point?
i am glad that dr. moran has described his views on this topic as  “tentative positions that i am exploring.”
however, holistic  medicine is not a scientific tradition.
you said, “if he wants to test the hypothesis that emotional and psychological factors affect the outcome of surgery, then he should test that hypothesis, not bring a ditzy magical thinker into the operating room to violate the privacy of the patient…” first, if the article reported correctly, the patient was very pleased with the “ditzy magical thinker”.
the science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine series: science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine part 1: tu quoque and history science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine, part 2: the tortured logic of  david katz science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine, part 3: implausible claims  and formal ethics statements science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine, part 4: is “cam”  the only alternative?
while i appreciate this thoughtful discussion (and the website in general), i must take issue with the adjective “primitive” as used to describe a hypothetical patient with shamanistic beliefs.
dr. a, “every pharmacy in europe that advertises  “homeopathie” is committing fraud, plain and simple.”
there was no discussion as to whether this might be a gateway for introducing an acceptance of ‘magic’ or woo in medicine, and how we might establish the firm boundaries around when it might be appropriate or not.
i was not the victim of the md.
i suspect that if you look at the names of the researchers in most major scientific institutions and journals, you will find that a great many come from non-western cultures.
and there is considerable evidence against some of the above.
i think that it is the general public that has gotten politicians, doctors and scientific institutions to offer cam and that it was the marketers in the dietary supplement industry that got the public to do that.”
everything i hear you and several of your colleagues say sounds like you are horrified by woo and think that cam = woo, that cam is caused by woo and that if only all mds were “critical thinkers” woo would vanish at least from scientific institutions.
that science provides a clear discrimination between what works and what doesn’t.
at the time the article was written, the terms “complementary and alternative medicine” (“cam”) and “evidence-based medicine” (ebm) had yet to enter the lexicon.
dr. a, “patients are not the problem; they are, if you’ll  excuse the drama, the victims.”
ironically enough unscientific medicine originated or at least entered its golden age in europe and english speaking countries although proponents of unscientific medicine sometimes seem to like to think that it is a reincarnation of primitive medicine.
the science that matters will be argued out in  other arenas.
nor did i really think  that dr. moran was “talking aboutdoctors promoting ‘cam’ or  placebo treatments as a matter of policy.”
the physician as expert consultant philosophers clark glymour and douglas stalker wrote an article 25 years  ago for the new england journal of medicine titled “engineers,  cranks, physicians, magicians.”
# rjstan@together.net on 02 aug 2008 at 10:10 pm dr. atwood, since i’m sure if people are reading this that i am  driving them crazy, i will try hard to make this my last comment on this topic.
the same shelves boast best-selling books  on holistic medicine authored by professors at distinguished medal schools and,  in at least one case, by a physician administrator at the national institutes  of health.
ultimately, though, it’s still the tribesman’s/patient’s
* i added passages from a couple of key medical ethics treatises to support my assertion.
i think that in addition to irrational beliefs there are psychological, emotional and financial reasons why patients and mds resort to unscientific medicine.
i don’t mean to suggest that religion is equivalent to shamanism, only that the md is responding to the patient’s request for psycological/spiritual/cultural support from someone the patient trusts.
some doctors who use cam recognize this and try to use it to benefit the patient.
if i  were the patient, i’d be angry as a hornet if he even suggested such a  thing.
the only one who sees a magnitude of difference between the  recommendation of the use of a supplement based on the single report of its use  as a preservative and the publication of “lab” reports showing in  vitro activity when there was no such activity?

[...it's] a reactionary  impetus to return the practice of medicine to the practice of magic and to  replace logic and method with occultism and obfuscation.”
i agree that in all contexts, some versions of fraud are more dangerous than others.
rjstan said, “in addition to irrational beliefs there are psychological, emotional and financial reasons why patients and mds resort to unscientific medicine…humans have emotional and psychological needs, many of which are not being met.”
rosemary, here are more responses: all i’m trying to do is point out that the picture is much bigger than “woo” and that the danger of snake oil is far greater than accepting irrational beliefs.
i was the victim of the drug company that published fraudulent ads.
imo, it is more like a belief in the myth of the “good old days” when everything was simple and wonderful.
that some modern physicians prescribe potent drugs solely for placebo effects (and to get patients out of their offices) is an indictment of that practice, not an argument for “cam.”
i use the term “unscientific medicine” for what is presently often called alternative, holistic, natural, integrative or complementary.
that some modern physicians prescribe potent drugs solely for  placebo effects (and to get patients out of their offices) is an indictment of  that practice, not an argument for “cam.”
plus, there was the usual strand that considered whether the placebo response of cam might justify its use if it might be implemented in an ethical manner.
i found several articles by the agency, the name escapes me, that preceeded the fda.

if you limit your exposes to irrational beliefs you will have a much narrower audience and much smaller impact than if you expose fraud.

i use the term “unscientific medicine” for what is presently  often called alternative, holistic, natural, integrative or complementary.
insofar as it extends beyond banality, the holistic medical movement constitutes both a deliberate attempt to substitute a magical for an engineering conception of the physician and an attack on scientific understanding and reasoning.

i don’t  have the time to investigate.
there could be one person spending billions on supplements  or billions each spending 1 dollar.

this view is also context sensitive since considerable  scientific evidence suggests the likelihood of symptom relief by the placebo  medicines of cam and from interactions with cam practitioners.
imo, the  only way that we can really have a major impact and protect the public is to  have many people actually learn enough about supplements to recognize fraud  when it occurs and expose it.
people are self medicating.”
such candor serves to  maintain my view of him as our “conscience,” even as it makes  me optimistic that we might dissuade him from making those  positions permanent.
as  magicians, they possess magical powers either because of the occult knowledge  they possess or simply because of who they are—for example, because they  stand in some special relation to gods or demons.
i realize that that may sound contradictory to you, but it isn’t to me.
what this adds up to is that the public may not be (generally) as indiscriminate in their use of alternative methods and as in need of protection from unscientific concepts as we healthfrauders like to think.
there are plenty of modern physicians whose patients are not  disposed to look elsewhere, even if those patients have “nonspecific  tiredness and unhappiness” and even if those physicians don’t  suggest woo.
school needs money and is looking for  “alternatives” to bring it in.
all i’m trying to do is point out that the picture is much bigger than  “woo” and that the danger of snake oil is far greater than  accepting irrational beliefs.
i subscribe to a lot of cam  stuff*, admittedly, but that’s going too far.
dr. atwood, since i’m sure if people are reading this that i am driving them crazy, i will try hard to make this my last comment on this topic.
it is a bad thing because, to quote ka, “implausible claims being  promoted, tacitly or otherwise” leads to ” unnecessary expense, a  patient later feeling betrayed by her physician when the treatment  doesn’t work or the “placebo effect” wears off and she  realizes that it was only a “pretend medicine” all along,  other patients or physicians concluding that the treatments have validity  (and possibly being convinced to forgo rational treatment), people in general  losing confidence in modern medicine when it appears that many  physicians can’t distinguish between the rational and the bogus, wasted  research funds, human subjects unnecessarily duped and endangered, a befuddled  media a befuddled public befuddled leglislators endorsing quacks to a befuddled  public.”
imo, claiming that scientific  medicine is the sole province of white males and the west is about as  prejudiced as you can get since it implies that the rest of us are too dumb to  recognize and embrace the great benefits scientific medicine has offered the  world and the great promise it still offers it.
and like peter, i have no objection to  patients using unscientific treatments as long as they can give informed  consent.
# pmoran on 05 aug 2008 at 2:31 am we have reached that point where the urge to respond to every comment can  expand verbiage exponentially and tiresomely.
even seemingly benign practices, if implausible, can be harmful (“first, do no harm”), particularly when promoted by someone who should know better.
despite this, nearly all also use conventional methods, and are satisfied with that.
we have reached that point where the urge to respond to every comment can expand verbiage exponentially and tiresomely.
the “homeopathie” in the window is a de facto claim about  efficacy.
if the movement were without influence on american life, we would be indifferent, but it is not.
i know nothing about oz.
woo and fraud are not  mutually exclusive.
this is the very reason why i have an interest in examining  the kind of messages we are putting out.
would skeptics prefer those using such remedies for  their minor and self-limiting complaints to be using nsaids or antibiotics or  antidepressants instead, treatments that will often in such contexts themselves  perform no better than placebo, but at substantially greater risks?
it would be great if that law were repealed, and  i’m sure we’d all be for it.
many patients, perhaps most, expect honesty and integrity, and have a pretty good sense of when they see it and when they don’t.
i hope we agree that  “pleasing customers” isn’t a valid reason for violating  medical ethics.
a great deal of what physicians learn consists of biologic and biochemical generalizations, broadly construed, but they also learn a substantial body of psychophysical generalizations which can be regarded as bridging the crevasse between mind and body.
i  read one and it didn’t say anything about drinking silver.
they dispense with cultural  relativism, another favorite refuge of imc advocates, and demolish  the ”differing paradigms of thomas kuhn” contrivance: holistic advocates repeatedly cite kuhn and claim that holistic medicine is  an alternative paradigm with its own standards, one that cannot be understood  or assessed by the practitioners of orthodox medicine.
the claim to diagnose by examining the  eye or to cure by massaging the foot is completely bogus; we know more than  enough about the workings of the body to be reasonably certain that geometric  features of the iris, for instance, do not provide the specific information  about disorders that iridologists claim they do….of course, it is  conceivable that the beliefs of scientific medicine are in error about one or  another of these matters, but that is no reason for using public funds to  investigate holistic claims.
i have not assumed, nor is the  assumption inherent in ethical objections to physicians
the authors expose the fallacy of the argument that  “holistic medicine has not really been investigated, that funds ought to  be made available for conducting tests of holistic practices, and that  meanwhile we should keep our minds open about holistic techniques.”
you state, “the “homeopathie” in the window is a de facto  claim about efficacy.”
it is a waste of time talking ethics to those who don’t share quite the same scientific convictions, and that applies to almost everyone.
proponents of unscientific medicine often erroneously claim that scientific medicine is based on a system of cultural beliefs held by arrogant, nasty, prejudiced, euro-centric, white men who favor white coats, ties and stethoscopes.
the silver quacks quote p. 538 of hartman’s book where he  says something like silver has been found safe enough to put into the eyes and
holist therapies can be divided into  those that are adaptations of traditional medical practices in other  societies—chinese, navajo, and so forth—and those that were  invented, so to speak, the week before last by some relatively successful crank.
i agree that “medicine is about an infinite number of individual contexts and [there are] many examples where ethical absolutes do not apply or don’t seem to apply very well.”
am i the only one who thinks that when exposing quackery you should give a lot more weight and spend a lot more time and effort on fraudulent, made up, deliberately invented reports of benefits than on things as utterly silly as with wacky people, often very nice wacky people telling others to drink something to cure a disease like aids because there is one study that showed it worked as a preservative, or because the fairies told you that it worked or maybe the stars indicate that it does?
i  located his articles that included photos of petri dishes with silver  supposedly killing bacteria.
hermano, i think it should be illegal for anyone treating patients to sell them products for which they make health claims, and i do mean anyone, md, nd, dc, etc.
i think that it is the general public that has gotten  politicians, doctors and scientific institutions to offer cam and that it was  the marketers in the dietary supplement industry that got the public to do  that.”
they don’t seem to be vastly  worse off health-wise or science-wise, or even exceptionally befuddled, yet 50%  of their doctors prescribe homeopathic remedies and a further 10% use herbs.
that “alternative” methods do nothing worthwhile for those using them, anyway.
quacks who are not physicians have also  been kept in check, until recently, by governmental pressures.
the authors refute the charge that “the lack of evidence concerning  the specific curative powers of holistic therapies is the result of a  conspiracy of disinterest.”
insofar as such multiple factors are known and believed to be important, they  are routinely addressed in conventional medicine practice.
imo, cam developed because of the failure of psychotherapy or perhaps because it offered people high expectations and failed to deliver.
i subscribe to a lot of cam stuff*, admittedly, but that’s going too far.
too many people seem willing to swallow the rhetoric—even too many medical doctors—and the results will not be benign.
although the holistic movement does not contain a conception of medicine distinct from those we have discussed, it does contain a reactionary impetus to return the practice of medicine to the practice of magic and to replace logic and method with occultism and obfuscation.
as much as i hate  playing the “you’re sick because society made you sick” card,  i would never tell someone that they’re sick because they somehow brought  it upon themselves.
he allows motz to tell patients they are responsible for their own illness, and she makes them act out the anger and relieve emotions that were going on in their life at the time their illness began.
it is they who have embarrassed science and medicine, and who have violated the public trust.
modern physicians, unlike people in general, have an ethical and scientific mandate to act rationally.
k & m are  having here.
society although i don’t really know that they were ever met and i  certainly don’t think that we should expect medicine to meet those needs,
i don’t believe in god and assume that most of you don’t  either.
dr. atwood, “but rosemary, you yourself are an example of a patient who was a victim!”
on the bottom of the same page, something the silver quacks never mention, he says that colloidal lead, another crookes product, has been successfully intecjed into cancerous tumors.
cranks have been common  throughout the history of science, as kuhn, a distinguished historian of  science, knew well.
the alternative is to explain to the patient that the complaint is minor or self-limiting!
when i tried to file a complaint with the ftc, i said to the lady,  “they are quoting old quacks as if they were reputable researchers  working today!”
to help convey that picture to the general public they sometimes call scientific medicine western medicine.
at columbia-presbyterian the presence of hands-on healers in an operating room is only the most dramatic example of a new willingness to venture into the terra incognita of healing.
doctors must be honest.
if i did, i’d get a copy of motz’s book and contact columbia to see if her statements are true.
i see nothing wrong with that, even if the md disbelieves in both  shamanism and religion.
in part, a banal rhetoric  about the physician as consoler;… in part, familiar and rather useless  admonitions about not overlooking the abundance of circumstances that may  contribute to one condition or another.
a physician engineer can act as consoler; nothing in either logic or social psychology forbids it.
it has no paradigmatic work, no  recognized set of problems, and no shared standards for what constitutes a  solution to those problems; it also lacks the critical exchange among its  practitioners that is characteristic of the sciences.
dr. b. he is a reputable silver researcher horrified by the way silver quacks cite his work to promote supplements.
[a] philosophers clark glymour and douglas stalker contributed a classic paper on this issue: engineers, cranks, physicians, magicians.
unless they tell customers that they are safe, they aren’t committing fraud.
so are you fer it er agin it?
it contains pictures of the petri dishes that look just like those crookes showed in his articles because they are.
that means pleasing customers.
fraud infuriates me and i am not going to  split hairs with definitions of fraud and irrational beliefs.
jama called old henry a quack in 1919.
we keep on offering the public temporary answers to these things, prescribing (historically) amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, barbiturates and phenothiazines in massive quantities, only to take them away when problems such as addiction ensue.
the only real reason i can see for  treating the witch doctor/tribesman situation differently is that the  tribesman’s knowledge may be more limited.
we scientists are ever-so cautious when making scientific judgments about complex matters; let’s not pretend that arriving at absolutes in medical ethics is a piece of cake, especially when it is not quite clear how anything done with the undiluted welfare of the individual patient in mind can be entirely unethical.
that people of ordinary intelligence and experience can nevertheless almost  instinctively sense the weaknesses and exaggerations in some of our habitual  arguments.
they don’t seem to be vastly worse off health-wise or science-wise, or even exceptionally befuddled, yet 50% of their doctors prescribe homeopathic remedies and a further 10% use herbs.
but, what i find interesting this year as regards ‘such anachronistic irrationality’ — as relates to this specific post by dr. a. — is that there is now a ‘holistic partnership’: the aanp [north american 'federally accredited' naturopathy] has joined forces with the ahma [american holistic medical association] for their annual convention “embody nature / redefine health” (see http://www.aanp.com/).
the alternative is to explain to the patient that the  complaint is minor or self-limiting!
i would not give him the benefit of the doubt.
supplements are not the only part of cam but they are the common denominator, the fuel that runs the industry, the billion $$ money maker.
but certain combinations are impossible or  extraordinarily unlikely.
ka dr. moran is indeed “muy simpático”.
a huge example, which is the basis for several of the most pernicious organizations of “cam” physicians and of the most expensive and largest trial yet funded by the nccam, is discussed at lengthhere.
(although i’ve lived in italy, spain and german, i never remember going  into a pharmacy in europe.)
when i read this, i thought that the doctor had a lot of very frightened, nervous patients who he didn’t want to deal with so he called in the “healers” to calm them for him.
yet today’s silver quacks are still citing the old quack articles.
these distinctions are more logical than sociological, and a society may combine several of them in the roles it assigns to healers.
i read one and it didn’t say anything about drinking silver.
dr. a, “by your own description, there was no “dietary  supplement industry” as it now exists when your doctor treated you with  silver.
end with a seriously ill person trying something he believes can’t  possibly help, but using it because he has heard stories that it does?
too many people seem willing to swallow the  rhetoric—even too many medical doctors—and the results will not be  benign.
i am a strong believer in evidence based medicine and i have great respect  for the authors on this site for their incredible knowledge, intelligence,  talent and high ethical standards, but i think there is a very nasty epidemic  out there called cam affecting the majority of people in many industrialized  countries.
is it right to then turn around and say, well you didn’t really need these things anyway, even denying them any relief that they may derive from “pretend medicines”.
that’s anatomically impossible – there’s a layer of bone in the way.
am i the only one who sees a difference in the role of a prosecutor and a  scientist, the ftc and the fda?
and please remember  that many victims of quackery were not injured by bad practitioners of  scientific medicine.
what if the md thinks the witch doctor’s potion is potentially harmful?
regarding points 2 and 3, i agree that the only “value” of almost all “cam” treatments is in their “placebo effects.”
i remained an adolescent for some time,
there was no discussion as to whether this might be a gateway for  introducing an acceptance of ‘magic’ or woo in medicine, and how we  might establish the firm boundaries around when it might be appropriate or not.
you will only be talking to each other.
in  his training and skill oz personified the prowess of western medical science;  in his experience he understood its limitations.
when i heard that silver was being sold as a supplement, i asked the salesmen how they knew it was safe and effective.
i agree that describing science-based  medicine as ‘western’ was poor phrasing; it was force of habit on  my part (although i was unaware that others have used this phrase to denigrate  the scientific approach to medicine).
misunderstanding what you say?
the standard healthfraud position is that even if cam may sometimes be  helpful to people, it is a bad thing regarding which there can be no compromise.
doctors cannot do what they  want.
[pelletier 1979] this is not a new revelation about medicine.
“dr. a, “point 3 also brings psychotherapy to mind.”
the  difference between us is that i insist that medicine is about an infinite  number of individual contexts and i see many examples where ethical absolutes  (actually these are ethical guidelines rather than directives) do not apply or  don’t seem to apply very well.
i’ll try again, but  before i do… harriet, if what you claim motz wrote is true, my opinions of oz would be  very different.
from glymour and stalker: the principles governing scientific reasoning and belief are negative as  well as positive, and they imply that occult doctrines are not worthy of  belief.
as i’ve said repeatedly,  supplements are the fuel that runs the entire alt.
the therapies described and recommended in a typical book of the genre include biofeedback, hypnosis, psychic healing, chiropractic, tai chi, iridology, homeopathy, acupuncture, clairvoyant diagnosis, human auras, and rolfing.
i get the impression you weigh all silly, nonsense equally.
in the meantime, there is the unnecessary expense, a patient later feeling betrayed by her physician when the treatment doesn’t work or the “placebo effect” wears off and she realizes that it was only a “pretend medicine” all along, other patients orphysicians concluding that the treatments have validity (and possiblybeing convinced to forgo rational treatment), people in general losing confidence in modern medicine when it appears that many physicians can’t distinguishbetween the rational and the bogus, wasted research funds, human subjects unnecessarily duped and endangered, a befuddled media, a befuddled public, befuddled leglislators endorsing quacks to a befuddled public, and more.
just  as he would have a duty to advise against going to a laetrile clinic.
these days such studies  even often include quality-adjusted life year (qaly) measurements so that all  aspects of patient life can bear upon a precise, measurement-based, final  judgment.
yes, i would not be the first exception to that  rule.
oh, how i’d love to read a follow up!
as far as i’m concerned people and doctors can do what they want to themselves and consenting adults but they have to be honest about it.
the reason i am being a bit stubborn about these matters is that i have  what is as yet merely a vague inkling that they are important — that they  may, despite initial appearances, help rather than damage our purposes.
and the good quacks could easily  fool the best critical thinker if he didn’t begin by checking the facts,  a task that can get overwhelming very quickly and which is the main reason why  the person making the claim has to substantiate it.
perhaps it is those who think  medicine is collapsing into a sea of “woo” despite their best  efforts so far who should be rechecking whether their understanding of the  world of medicine is anything more than an adequate first approximation.
nor do the stores explain anything, at least in writing, about the “remedies” containing nothing.
they dispense with cultural relativism, another favorite refuge of imc advocates, and demolish the ”differing paradigms of thomas kuhn” contrivance: holistic advocates repeatedly cite kuhn and claim that holistic medicine is an alternative paradigm with its own standards, one that cannot be understood or assessed by the practitioners of orthodox medicine.
# pmoran on 05 aug 2008 at 5:21 pm i’ll try and find a better word than “primitive” but just  about any word i can think of seems likely to be regarded as pejorative by  those who see much to prize in the medical beliefs of ancient cultures.
sure, there is one now, and it’s undoubtedly an important part of  the problem of irrational medical claims, but it’s not the only part and  it’s not the part that i, for one, either know much about or can do much  about.”

the silver quacks quote p. 538 of hartman’s book where he says something like silver has been found safe enough to put into the eyes and nose.
almost all “dietary supplement” marketing  claims are woo, in that they are not backed by anything close to reasonable  evidence.
i believe this word  was intended to describe a person not educated in ‘western’ science  or medicine, and the challenges involved in communicating with such a person  might certainly be daunting.
imo, cam developed because of the failure of psychotherapy or perhaps because it offered people high expectations and failed to deliver.”
if the patient shares the shaman’s religious beliefs and  views him/her as a priest in his religion, then calling in the shaman is quite  equivalent to calling in a priest to comfort the patient.
there is a vast  difference between the traditional, deeply held opinions of a primitive  tribesman and his witch doctor, on the one hand, and the addled opinions of a  born, raised, and (partially) educated american or european or australian  patient and hissnake oil peddling quack on the other.
# hermano on 03 aug 2008 at 10:21 pm rosemary, i understand you consider it unethical for the naturopaths to sell supplements to their patients.
there were ads that made it look as if he were alive and well and working  today.
my point about the failure of psychotherapy is that human beings have  emotional and psychological needs that aren’t being met in today’s
the selling of woo, whether for financial gain or not, is fraud.
many were injured by supplements they bought after reading  fraudulent ads.
this will certainly affect any  efforts to advise him regarding useless or potentially harmful potions.
rather, the honest physician will admit  to not being able to explain the symptoms, but acknowledge that they must be  distressing and suggest that it might be helpful to discuss how they impinge on  the patient’s life and how she might better cope with them.
again, the physician may be understood to be someone who applies a reliable body of knowledge that is not warranted by science or by magic but is simply known and, so far as the community is concerned, always has been known.
ultimately, though, it’s still the tribesman’s/patient’s decision.
some of them play a  dominant part in the understanding of medicine in other societies, and some  serve to qualify the conception of the physician as engineer even in our own  society.
if the movement were  without influence on american life, we would be indifferent, but it is not.
to help convey that picture to the general public they sometimes  call scientific medicine western medicine.
in 1978, a group of medical and osteopathic physicians formed the american holistic medicine association, which now publishes a journal and whose meetings have been recognized for education purposes by the american medical association.
rosemary, i understand you consider it unethical for the naturopaths to sell supplements to their patients.
engineers  need not care in principle whether the generalizations on which they rely are  psychological, physical, or psychophysical; what they care about is that the  generalizations be applicable and that their reliability be scientifically  demonstrated.
the science that matters will be argued out in other arenas.
the answer to point 3 is the same as the answer to point 2, and i certainly don’t mind if “people feel better for taking a multivitamin or an innocuous herb” (if that were the extent of “cam” we’d hardly be wasting our time here).
my  favorite: “the work of cranks does not constitute a scientific  revolution” words of wisdom.
he allows motz to tell  patients they are responsible for their own illness, and she makes them act out  the anger and relieve emotions that were going on in their life at the time  their illness began.
i use honey instead of neosporin on my cuts, and eat a largely vegetarian diet–not because i think it’s healthier (which i do), but because i just happen to not like the taste of meat.
please find a different, less perjorative word to describe other cultures!
in last week’s post, i dubbed dr. peter moran the  “conscience” of sbm, citing his commitment to doing what’s  best for individual patients even if, in theory at least, that may involve some  manner of benign but fanciful treatments.
more than  willing — he felt ethically obliged.
is there another, holistic, conception of medicine distinct from those described above?
when i read this, i thought that the doctor had a lot of very  frightened, nervous patients who he didn’t want to deal with so he called  in the “healers” to calm them for him.
patients are not the  problem; they are, if you’ll excuse the drama, the victims.
i am very glad dr. atwood sees him as a moral compass.
if by that you mean that you think that all cam is irrational, you are wrong.
rosemary, “woo” means “bullshit.”
ok, but if he’s not going to do research and is not using any control group, he has no right to make the claims he is making for the efficacy of the woo.
some are patently false.
in 1995 i read the following article in the ny times.
a medicine man can combine traditional therapies with magical claims, and both with a bit of consolation.
so  what is the safest and most pragmatically realistic position here?
there is a vast difference between the traditional, deeply held opinions of a primitive tribesman and his witch doctor, on the one hand, and the addled opinions of a born, raised, and (partially) educated american or european or australian patient and hissnake oil peddling quack on the other.
(i am not going to get into the value or ethics of this here.
he was definitely naive in that he believed the ads in an era when drug companies were not strictly regulated, but according to my definition, he was not a quack.
i do not know if he believes in the nonsense as motz does or if he feels it relieves depression in specific patients and hopes that that will improve their surgical outcomes.
# rjstan@together.net on 04 aug 2008 at 5:27 am hermano, i think it should be illegal for anyone treating patients to sell  them products for which they make health claims, and i do mean anyone, md, nd,  dc, etc.
isn’t that what we’re focusing on here?
there could be one person spending billions on supplements or billions each spending 1 dollar.
by  your own description, there was no “dietary supplement industry” as  it now exists when your doctor treated you with silver.
and: the physician as expert consultant science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine, part 5: penultimate words 40 responses so far 40 responses to “science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine, part  4: is “cam” the only alternative?
all the studies i’ve seen show that a huge number of people is  spending a huge amount of money on supplements which they believe or hope offer  health benefits.
depending on the circumstances, it may or may not be appropriate for the md to tell the tribesman/patient that the potion/homeopathy is almost certainly worthless.
his last chapter is on colloids in medicine.
next week: loose ends ……………… * the science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine series: science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine part 1: tu quoque and history science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine, part 2: the tortured logic of david katz science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine, part 3: implausible claims and formal ethics statements science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine, part 4: is “cam” the only alternative?
it seems that your argument, distilled, is that it’s the dietary supplement industry, with its advertising and its financial incentives to pushers, that is at the bottom of the current “cam” fad.
i don’t feel i can judge the doctor with  today’s yardstick.
i think that it is the general public that has gotten politicians, doctors and scientific institutions to offer cam and that it was the marketers in the dietary supplement industry that got the public to do that.
i’ll try again, but before i do… harriet, if what you claim motz wrote is true, my opinions of oz would be very different.
dr. moran’sresponse, thoughtful and provocative as always, was buried in the midst of other commenters’ tangential arguments about the theory of evolution.
i don’t think that “cam” is only about woo; i think that “cam”is woo.
in fact, at least one medical ethicist has gone so far as to state that it is not unethical for a doctor to prescribe a placebo treatment, so long as the doctor believes it will benefit the patient.
it has no paradigmatic work, no recognized set of problems, and no shared standards for what constitutes a solution to those problems; it also lacks the critical exchange among its practitioners that is characteristic of the sciences.
i lost all respect for oz when he fell for an old carnival trick and suggested that john of god was doing something to stimulate the pituitary when he stuck forceps up a patient’s nose.
someone needs to investigate these psychological factors, but a gullible  believer in woo like dr. oz is not the one to do it.
what about treatments by the witch doctor (e.g. some potion)?
i suppose that  describing someone’s lack of knowledge of science-based medicine, or  belief in shamanism, as ‘primitive’ might be acceptable, although i  still think a better choice of words might be ‘non-scientific belief  system’ or some such, as clunky as that is.
fortunately, dr kim atwood has provided some lengthy extracts of this paper:  science, reason, ethics and modern medicine, part 4: is cam the only  alternative?
three things stand out to me.
if a surgeon doing a high risk operation suspects that having a wacky woman  wave her hands over the patient during the proceedure will calm the patient and  seriously decrease the amount of depression she experiences afterwards,  something he suspects will improve her chances of a good outcome, and invites  the wacky woman to proceed, is that very different than a doctor at his wits
on the bottom of the same page, something the silver quacks never  mention, he says that colloidal lead, another crookes product, has been  successfully intecjed into cancerous tumors.
i will try instead to move discussion on.
rather, the honest physician will admit to not being able to explain the symptoms, but acknowledge that they must be distressing and suggest that it might be helpful to discuss how they impinge on the patient’s life and how she might better cope with them.
but what do we mean by  “works”?
one hopes they will speak bluntly, but it does no good to join forces  with cranks and quacks, magicians and madmen.
if there were new approaches that might improve the quality of life of cardiac patients, oz was willing to raise some eyebrows to evaluate them and do what he could to nudge a major medical center in new directions.
a medicine man can  combine traditional therapies with magical claims, and both with a bit of  consolation.
i was objecting to the use of the term ‘primitive’ to refer to a *person* (the hypothetical tribesman, in this case), rather than to a belief.
there are, moreover, plenty of rational, nonpharmacological treatments for all manner of minor or self-limiting complaints (and even for not so self-limiting complaints, such as chronic pain), e.g., gargling with hot water or sipping hot tea, time, avoiding environmental allergens, smoking cessation, weight loss, ice packs or heat packs, rest, exercise, massage (to make muscles feel better, not to “remove toxins”), pain management, physical therapy, eating more fibre, “sleep hygiene,” and many more.
i recognize that the proper ethical course won’t always be easy or obvious.
imo, cam developed because of the failure of psychotherapy or perhaps  because it offered people high expectations and failed to deliver.”
irrational beliefs are easy to target.
they probably realize it already, and that’s just not  going to help.
it is a bad thing because, to quote ka, “implausible claims being promoted, tacitly or otherwise” leads to ” unnecessary expense, a patient later feeling betrayed by her physician when the treatment doesn’t work or the “placebo effect” wears off and she realizes that it was only a “pretend medicine” all along, other patients or physicians concluding that the treatments have validity (and possibly being convinced to forgo rational treatment), people in general losing confidence in modern medicine when it appears that many physicians can’t distinguish between the rational and the bogus, wasted research funds, human subjects unnecessarily duped and endangered, a befuddled media a befuddled public befuddled leglislators endorsing quacks to a befuddled public.”
my writing is aimed not at every person who dabbles in  “supplements,” but at people who should know better, such as some  physicians, some medical school deans and other administrators, some scientists  at the nih, and some legislators.
i think we all understand that.
i only wish to state it because i don’t think it is  accurate to use a broad brush to describe all mds who practice cam.)”
what ties together the diverse practices…?
i only wish to state it because i don’t think it is  accurate to use a broad brush to describe all mds who practice cam.)
to make such a  claim seem somehow profound, holistic writers invariably conjoin it with a  discussion of cartesian dualism, insinuating that modern medicine follow  descartes in postulating an impassable chasm between the mind and the body.
if i were the patient, i’d be angry as a hornet if he even suggested such a thing.
patients who suffer from coronary heart disease may be treated with beta blockers and antiplatelet drugs, and they may also be advised to change their work, their diet, their smoking habits, their exercise habits, and their living conditions.
if  physicians cannot distinguish relevant from irrelevant factors, important from  unimportant causes, then they can do nothing.
the warrant behind this conception of the healer is tradition and “common knowledge.”
like all medical schools, columbia’s is grappling with the high cost  of specialized medical treatment.
if i were he, my greatest concern would be that rational patients would think that he was as wacky as motz sounds.
the cam stuff i subscribe to is that which falls under the range of “scientifically possible, though not yet proven”.
if the claim were valid, holistic practice would have to constitute a scientific tradition, albeit one in competition with the tradition of orthodox medicine.
one such conception is that physicians are consolers.

my major objection, as i’ve written in my bio and elsewhere on sbm, is to “implausible claims being promoted, tacitly or otherwise, by medical schools and government” and by physicians.
a physician engineer cannot honestly claim powers of magic or occult knowledge.
“if i were he, my greatest concern would be that rational patients would think that he was as wacky as motz sounds.”
she tells them they are bringing treatments such as surgery into their lives in order to relive their traumas, including prenatal traumas.
yet i have  suggested that healthfrauders routinely exaggerate the risks of cam, that some  potential dangers are not realized much in practice, and it again needs to be  said that the medical risks depend very much upon the specific  “quack” claim.
but, what i find interesting this year as regards ‘such anachronistic  irrationality’ — as relates to this specific post by dr. a. —  is that there is now a ‘holistic partnership’: the aanp [north american 'federally accredited' naturopathy] has joined  forces with the ahma [american holistic medical association] for their annual  convention “embody nature / redefine health” (see http://www.aanp.com/).
then they might just recover faster.
more than willing — he felt ethically obliged.
cranks have been common throughout the history of science, as kuhn, a distinguished historian of science, knew well.
the [...] holistic medicine is a pablum of common sense and nonsense offered by cranks and quacks and failed pedants who share an attachment to magic and an animosity toward reason.
insofar as such multiple factors are known and believed to be important, they are routinely addressed in conventional medicine practice.
that conventional medicine has adequate answers to all health problems  and the public should be content with what it offers.
doctors who push “cam” are not honest.
i don’t think you understand where these people are coming  from or speak their language.
however, many shamanistic cultures have incredibly complex social networks and family structures (for example) that are by no means ‘primitive’.
he made motz part  of his team and allowed her to introduce a macrobiotic diet, acupuncture,  hypnosis, aromatherapy, changing light from fluorescent to incandescent, and  cleaning the floors only with natural cleansers.
modern medicine does no such thing, and could not even if it wanted to, since  descartes held no such view.
the essay discusses assertions that “ ‘all states of health and  all disorders are considered to be psychosomatic’
the claim tacitly made by american or european physicians, and tacitly relied on by their patients, is that their palliatives and procedures have been shown by science to be effective.
to make such a claim seem somehow profound, holistic writers invariably conjoin it with a discussion of cartesian dualism, insinuating that modern medicine follow descartes in postulating an impassable chasm between the mind and the body.
here are some examples of the intellectual minefield we have to negotiate.
if congress is actually successful in giving the fda  the power to regulate tobacco(a terrible idea, in my opinion, but for reasons  that have nothing to do with this discussion), “supplement”  companies and advocates won’t have a leg to stand on.
again, the physician may be  understood to be someone who applies a reliable body of knowledge that is not  warranted by science or by magic but is simply known and, so far as the  community is concerned, always has been known.
we disagree elsewhere,  but he makes some interesting points.
also, some of these outcomes, if as truly awful as  implied, may be thought of as mainly exposing a puzzling lack of reach for more  rational voices.
i was quite struck by them, for i have had very similar personal experiences and observed them in many patients.
supplement promoters, especially botanical promoters, are often  brilliant, rational and know some science.
am i really the only one who sees a magnitude of difference between the recommendation of the use of a supplement based on the single report of its use as a preservative and the publication of “lab” reports showing in vitro activity when there was no such activity?
are you ok with “team atwood”  making $$huge$$ profits selling “classic” thongs all over the  internet?
the work of cranks does not constitute a scientific revolution, and no cranks appear among kuhn’s many examples.
ka seems to help my argument with personal medical experiences that are reminiscent of some of stories of “alternative” testimonial.
i would also try  hard to find out what oz is doing there now and what he has done since the  article i cited was published in 1995.
and: the physician as expert consultant science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine, part 5: penultimate words 40 responses so far excellent post with much food for thought and some great sound bites.
he did not sell the drug he prescribed.
most  people and even many mds are not.
yes, it is true that this patient needs help, but if physicians held  exclusively to that ethic they wouldn’t have to concern themselves  with antibiotic resistance, universal immunizations, judicious use of  expensive but very low yield tests that are physically harmless and paid  for with pooled money, or other cost-containment issues that don’t  immediately affect this patient, would they?
i simply can’t believe all that is in the patients’ best interests.
it is entirely the  same with physicians, who must apply both explicit scientific principles and  also a great deal of tacit knowledge to the treatment of their patients.
i only wish to state it because i don’t think it is accurate to use a broad brush to describe all mds who practice cam.)
this will certainly affect any efforts to advise him regarding useless or potentially harmful potions.
it is entirely the same with physicians, who must apply both explicit scientific principles and also a great deal of tacit knowledge to the treatment of their patients.
what harriet wrote about motz and oz is accurate.
shamans derive their influence from playing, in essence, the same role as ministers or priests in their society.
we have to know why people are using silly therapies and the reasons are many.
and: the physician as expert consultant published by kimball atwood under health fraud, medical ethics, science and medicine comments: 40 dr. moran weighs
second, i think that if oz is the talented surgeon claimed and if he enjoys doing surgery, that that is what he should do.
it’s the scientific  institutions (and medical schools and governmental endorsements) that i’m  after.
# harriet hall on 02 aug 2008 at 10:05 pm rjstan said, “in addition to irrational beliefs there are  psychological, emotional and financial reasons why patients and mds resort to  unscientific medicine…humans have emotional and psychological needs,  many of which are not being met.”
do dr. oz’ patients get any say in whether they are to be (and pay for being) the subject of someone’s ritual magic?
first, if it can be shown that something  works to improve the outcome of surgery, oz will use it without regard to why  it works.
the claim  tacitly made by american or european physicians, and tacitly relied on by their  patients, is that their palliatives and procedures have been shown by science  to be effective.
the refusal of some physicians and patients to accept that truth is, in my opinion, an important basis for a “cam” subset, “ fad diagnoses” (perhaps a topic for another time).
we don’t care that they may be being used mainly when there is no entirely satisfactory evidence-based treatments for the complaint, nor that some of the methods may simply have not yet been subjected to sufficient study to be quite sure whether they have intrinsic medical activity or not.
the practice of medicine in the united states and in other industrialized  nations is a form of consultant engineering.
he could sew bypass grafts and  implant new hearts, but he was hard pressed to change the habits that put his  patients on the operating table or to grapple with the emotional and  psychological factors that might hasten their healing.
too many people seem willing to swallow the rhetoric—even  too many medical doctors—and the results will not be benign.
on the contrary, they are by training and by  culture enmeshed in a tradition of rational thought about the obligations and  responsibilities of their profession.
ironically enough unscientific medicine originated or at least entered its  golden age in europe and english speaking countries although proponents of  unscientific medicine sometimes seem to like to think that it is a  reincarnation of primitive medicine.
rosemary, first, excuse me for not having read your latest comment before posting my own.
i recognize that the proper ethical course won’t always be easy or  obvious.
other than that it is as timely now as it was then, and is also pertinent to much of the discussion here (note to dr. moran: this is no longer directed at you; i know that you are aware of these things).
even  if patients are victimized by themselves, it’s still up to an ethical  physician to point that out.
plus, there was the usual strand that considered whether the placebo  response of cam might justify its use if it might be implemented in an ethical  manner.
however, i also believe that to refuse to acknolwedge and appreciate the huge pressure put on individual practitioners and institutions by patients deceived by marketing geniuses indicates a failure to see a big aspect of the problem.
that expression clearly originated as an attempt to bring  an extremely effective approach to medicine down to the same level as a pack of  others that have been tried throughout the history of mankind.
fraud infuriates me and i am not going to split hairs with definitions of fraud and irrational beliefs.
of course i agree that “pleasing customers” is not a reason to  deceive patients.
in the meantime, there is the unnecessary expense, a  patient later feeling betrayed by her physician when the treatment  doesn’t work or the “placebo effect” wears off and she  realizes that it was only a “pretend medicine” all along,  other patients orphysicians concluding that the treatments have validity  (and possiblybeing convinced to forgo rational treatment), people in general  losing confidence in modern medicine when it appears that many physicians can’t distinguishbetween the rational and the bogus, wasted  research funds, human subjects unnecessarily duped and endangered, a befuddled  media, a befuddled public, befuddled leglislators endorsing quacks to a  befuddled public, and more.
if physicians learn relatively fewer generalizations that are  entirely psychological or social in nature or that posit psychological  mechanisms for physical effects, the reason is not that such generalizations  are alien to the “medical model” but that relatively few of them  are applicable and scientifically warranted.
if you found that washing soda and water  worked just as well as your average floor cleaner with seventeen chemicals (and  it does–i use it on our floors), is it really that terrible to change?
promoting ”cam,” that “conventional medicine has  adequate answers to all health problems.”
recently i accessed the article on the ny times archives site and suggest  that you do the same because it pertains to the discussion
there are, moreover, plenty of rational, nonpharmacological treatments for  all manner of minor or self-limiting complaints (and even for not so  self-limiting complaints, such as chronic pain), e.g., gargling with hot water  or sipping hot tea, time, avoiding environmental allergens, smoking cessation,  weight loss, ice packs or heat packs, rest, exercise, massage (to make muscles  feel better, not to “remove toxins”), pain management, physical  therapy, eating more fibre, “sleep hygiene,” and many more.
there  are numerous quackademics at prestigious medical schools and elsewhere whose  original motivations had nothing to do with dietary supplements, although in  some cases those became part of their “programs” later, for obvious  reasons.
i will not  pull files.
for example, generalizations concerning the effects of drugs, correlating the location of pain with other physical symptoms of disease, and positing the causal factors in dizziness and senility connect the mental with the physical and are thus useful for medical engineering.
rosemary, once again we are cross-posting, but no matter.
i don’t feel i can judge the doctor with today’s yardstick.
or attributing its effects to qi, subluxations, or other mythical entities.
i just don’t think that physicians  should make false claims.
it would be nice to be  able to convince large numbers of people to stop using silly therapies, but  that’s a tall order.
much taller than trying to convince modern physicians to stop encouraging the use of silly therapies.
the authors expose the fallacy of the argument that “holistic medicine has not really been investigated, that funds ought to be made available for conducting tests of holistic practices, and that meanwhile we should keep our minds open about holistic techniques.”
at the time the article was written, the terms “complementary and  alternative medicine” (“cam”) and “evidence-based  medicine” (ebm) had yet to enter the lexicon.
the most compelling, in my opinion, is his point about “calling in  witch doctors.”
a huge example,  which is the basis for several of the most pernicious organizations of  “cam” physicians and of the most expensive and largest trial yet  funded by the nccam, is discussed at lengthhere.
i agree that describing science-based medicine as ‘western’ was poor phrasing; it was force of habit on my part (although i was unaware that others have used this phrase to denigrate the scientific approach to medicine).
holistic medicine is a pablum of common sense and nonsense offered by cranks  and quacks and failed pedants who share an attachment to magic and an animosity  toward reason.
as i’ve said repeatedly, supplements are the fuel that runs the entire alt.
dr. a, “every pharmacy in europe that advertises  “homeopathie” is committing fraud, plain and simple.
there are others who have pushed  “cam” drugs that are not “supplements” and that have no  financial backing or marketing efforts by their manufacturers.
the second occurred many years later and was heralded not by a conversation, but by a diagnostic test: after a couple of months of excruciating neck pain, i had a magnetic resonance imaging (mri) study that showed that my cervical spine was normal.
if there were new approaches that might improve the quality of life of  cardiac patients, oz was willing to raise some eyebrows to evaluate them and do  what he could to nudge a major medical center in new directions.
i don’t mean to suggest that religion is  equivalent to shamanism, only that the md is responding to the patient’s  request for psycological/spiritual/cultural support from someone the patient  trusts.
someone needs to investigate these psychological factors, but a gullible believer in woo like dr. oz is not the one to do it.
we expect skilled engineers to be able to learn from experience and  to get better at building bridges, because we believe that their training has  subjected them to a rational discipline that has made them good learners about  such matters.
am i the only one who thinks it is criminal, not irrational, to claim your product contains an element like silver, something so easy to know for sure, when it doesn’t?
by not  addressing that, you argue, we sbmers don’t have a chance to make much  difference.
alternatively, if an md called in the witch doctor on his own initiative,  that’s more problematic.
for example, generalizations  concerning the effects of drugs, correlating the location of pain with other  physical symptoms of disease, and positing the causal factors in dizziness and  senility connect the mental with the physical and are thus useful for medical  engineering.
proponents of unscientific medicine often erroneously claim that scientific  medicine is based on a system of cultural beliefs held by arrogant, nasty,  prejudiced, euro-centric, white men who favor white coats, ties and  stethoscopes.
like all medical schools, columbia’s is grappling with the high cost of specialized medical treatment.
precisely one of the points i made in the post.
my favorite: “the work of cranks does not constitute a scientific revolution” words of wisdom.
while on this subject, why do you use the word “western” to  distinguish science-and-technology-based medicine from that built upon religion  or old superstitions?
as far as i’m concerned people and doctors can do what they want to  themselves and consenting adults but they have to be honest about it.
i only wish to state it because i don’t think it is accurate to use a broad brush to describe all mds who practice cam.)”
the experiments  of dr. oz by chip brown; published: july 30, 1995 it is about  mehmet oz, md, a cardiac surgeon the author says is highly regarded in his  field at ny’s columbia-presbyterian.
he gave up trying to stop them.
many quacks are themselves physicians with no acceptable excuse, who until recently were kept in check by strong professional and governmental pressures, only to have found themselves reborn in a new “ golden age of quackery.”
[...] # rjstan@together.net on 02 aug 2008 at 7:41 am
but rosemary, you yourself are an example of a patient who was a victim!
there are plenty of modern physicians whose patients are not disposed to look elsewhere, even if those patients have “nonspecific tiredness and unhappiness” and even if those physicians don’t suggest woo.
because the article is not available online i’ve reproduced  several passages: medicine in industrialized nations is scientific medicine.
am i really the only one who sees a huge difference between lying to make  money, even when you know that your lie can result in harming people, and
i don’t agree that “cam” affects the majority of people in the sense that they are using “cam” treatments.
yes, that’s what i was going for – the similarity in emotional/cultural roles.
how about pre-scientific medicine?
i think for many people living today  psychotherapy replaced religion but it didn’t help many with their  psychological and emotional needs and now many are looking to medicine to do  that, and of course, they will be disappointed again.
hartman appears to have been a chemist at an indiana university.
because of such notions, …holistic practitioners…are under no obligation, they believe, to reconcile their claims about therapy with what is known about the causal pathways of the body.
and the good quacks could easily fool the best critical thinker if he didn’t begin by checking the facts, a task that can get overwhelming very quickly and which is the main reason why the person making the claim has to substantiate it.
that’s anatomically  impossible – there’s a layer of bone in the way.
unless  they tell customers that they are safe, they aren’t committing fraud.
their  newfoundendorsement by governmental edict is no more justified than would be a  similar endorsement of tribal witch doctors.
or attributing its effects to  qi, subluxations, or other mythical entities.
if i did, i’d get a copy of motz’s  book and contact columbia to see if her statements are true.
take my word for it that every  pharmacy in europe displays “homeopathie” (or language equivalents)
much taller than trying to convince modern  physicians to stop encouraging the use of silly therapies.
until you understand the general public and speak their language you will not be able to educate them or do much to stop cam from taking over the world.
nor did i really think that dr. moran was “talking aboutdoctors promoting ‘cam’ or placebo treatments as a matter of policy.”
you seem to think i am talking about doctors promoting cam or placebo treatment  as a matter of policy.
sure, some of his  clients may eventually realize that he is actually a nutcase, but even most of  those will probably find ways in which they think he has helped them.
and it’s not a matter of patients asking for woo; the energy healer  is officially part of dr. oz’s team: surely that influences patients.
if they feel talked down to (assuming any of  them even reads this stuff), that’s fine with me.
that  should answer both your questions.
and like peter, i have no objection to patients using unscientific treatments as long as they can give informed consent.
if the patient shares the shaman’s religious beliefs and views him/her as a priest in his religion, then calling in the shaman is quite equivalent to calling in a priest to comfort the patient.
a much-repeated and trivial thesis, and  moreover one that is said to characterize the sense in which holistic medicine  is “holistic,” amounts to no more than this: mental and  physical properties are interdependent.
i agree with you that there is “a very nasty epidemic out there  called cam.”
which brings me to this: in science-based medicine we are quite accustomed to evaluating medical options in terms of benefits vs risks.
their sales are thus fraudulent.
as you point out, you wouldn’t call in a priest to minister to a jewish patient or an atheist, nor would you call in a rabbi to minister to a catholic.
i’m not excusing surgeons for asking a person to perform  “healing touch” or anything so silly and implausible on a patient.
glymour and stalker were prescient in their conclusion: if holistic-health advocates were content with encouraging sensible preventive medicine or with criticizing the economic organization of american medicine, we might be enthusiastic, but they are not.
i don’t think he should be asked to do research certainly not on the outcomes of psychological interventions.
i eventually found he was writing for journals in england and selling  “collodial silver” there and in the us in the early 1900s.
these distinctions are more logical than sociological, and a society may  combine several of them in the roles it assigns to healers.
my objection is to lying to the patient, implying that a treatment is  supported by evidence when it really isn’t.
by your own description, there was no “dietary supplement industry” as it now exists when your doctor treated you with silver.
if that  is what you think, i believe it is very simplistic and inaccurate.
although the holistic movement does not contain a  conception of medicine distinct from those we have discussed, it does contain a  reactionary impetus to return the practice of medicine to the practice of magic  and to replace logic and method with occultism and obfuscation.
would skeptics prefer those using such remedies for their minor and self-limiting complaints to be using nsaids or antibiotics or antidepressants instead, treatments that will often in such contexts themselves perform no better than placebo, but at substantially greater risks?
it’s the scientific institutions (and medical schools and governmental endorsements) that i’m after.
i had to write mine piecemeal, and couldn’t look to see if you had  answered without losing mine.
there are others who have pushed “cam” drugs that are not “supplements” and that have no financial backing or marketing efforts by their manufacturers.
it keeps you from understanding the depth of the problem  and all the forces involved.

# kimball atwood on 02 aug 2008 at 1:44 pm dr. moran’s hypothetical about witch doctors struck me as  provocative, but after further consideration, i’m not sure it teaches us  anything new.
yes, it is true that this patient needs help, but if physicians held exclusively to that ethic they wouldn’t have to concern themselves with antibiotic resistance, universal immunizations, judicious use of expensive but very low yield tests that are physically harmless and paid for with pooled money, or other cost-containment issues that don’t immediately affect this patient, would they?
and it’s not the part that i, for one, either know much about or can do much about.
this isn’t the setting for a complete discussion, but it will surely come on sbm.
sometimes, of course, we are disappointed.
oh, how i’d love to  read a follow up!
promoting nonsense that you actually truly believe in like “energy  medicine” or prayer for the prevention and cure of disease?
dr. atwood, perhaps i sound contradictory because you see things as black or white and i see several shades of gray in between.
dr. a, “patients are not the problem; they are, if you’ll excuse the drama, the victims.”
actually, religion is more or less equivalent to shamanism.
the truth is obviously somewhere in between, but that doesn’t refute my assertion.
following on from that — what is the evidence-based answer to  non-specific tiredness and unhappiness?
superficially this is a powerful line of argument, because we can fairly easily find instances where such predictions are fulfilled.
but contrary to my initial impression, i don’t think the witch  doctor example reveals anything new.
that means pleasing customers.”
as i read the report the pain abated, never to return to its previous degree of severity.
i just don’t think that physicians should make false claims.
i located his articles that included photos of petri dishes with silver supposedly killing bacteria.
second, oz either believes that emotional and psychological factors affect the outcome of surgery or else wants to test that hypothesis, and, third, the med.
modern physicians,  unlike people in general, have an ethical and scientific mandate to act  rationally.
the work of cranks does not constitute a scientific  revolution, and no cranks appear among kuhn’s many examples.
second, oz either believes that emotional and psychological factors  affect the outcome of surgery or else wants to test that hypothesis, and,  third, the med.
we keep on offering the  public temporary answers to these things, prescribing (historically)  amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, barbiturates and phenothiazines in massive  quantities, only to take them away when problems such as addiction ensue.
on the contrary, they are by training and by culture enmeshed in a  tradition of rational thought about the obligations and responsibilities of  their profession.
insofar as it extends beyond banality, the holistic medical movement  constitutes both a deliberate attempt to substitute a magical for an  engineering conception of the physician and an attack on scientific  understanding and reasoning.
a physician engineer can act as consoler; nothing in either logic  or social psychology forbids it.
but the same thing applies to ‘modern’ patients.
if that is what you think, i believe it is very simplistic and inaccurate.
i reject, as i hope i made  clear above, the false dichotomy that for each health problem there is either a  proven treatment or there is “cam.”
alternatively, if an md called in the witch doctor on his own initiative, that’s more problematic.
however, i cannot judge what he did without knowing why he did it.
(some is on my webpage with citations.)
i was born in 1942 and have articles from med journals older than i  am lying about the safety and efficacy of silver drugs, articles older than i  am warning doctors about the fraud and fraudulent ads older than i am.
in his training and skill oz personified the prowess of western medical science; in his experience he understood its limitations.
i do not know if he believes in the nonsense as  motz does or if he feels it relieves depression in specific patients and hopes  that that will improve their surgical outcomes.
they cut and paste bad study after bad study showing efficacy and tear apart good ones showing none and laugh all the way to the bank which is exactly what they are paid to do, deceive people to make money.
whatever this means, it has nothing to do with any  possible practice of medicine, for no one can attend to everything.
although they couldn’t have foreseen thescientific blind spot that would soon hamper academic medicine in the form of “evidence-based medicine,” the authors portend discussions ofprior probability: although it might be interesting to know more about the physiological pathways that are correlated with such processes as the placebo effect, this has nothing do with taking seriously the claims advanced by iridologists or zone therapists or even chiropractors.
i don’t have the time to investigate.
sure, there is one now,  and it’s undoubtedly an important part of the problem of irrational  medical claims, but it’s not the only part
controversy or none, the rosenthal center brought a lot of doctors with an  interest in unorthodox therapies out of the closet, mehmet oz among them.
if  having a room smell of lavender and bergamot oil makes you calm (smell is very  closely tied to emotion), wouldn’t it be better than having you stressed  out by the hospital environment?
behind the  usual healthfraud position there is both an exaggeration of the capacity of  modern medicine and insufficient recognition of the harm that it can do.
am i the only one who sees how almost all mds and educated laypeople would laugh at the first and conclude that the nds were idiots but could possibly be fooled by the second?

holist therapies can be divided into those that are adaptations of traditional medical practices in other societies—chinese, navajo, and so forth—and those that were invented, so to speak, the week before last by some relatively successful crank.
i agree that “medicine is about an infinite number of individual  contexts and [there are] many examples where ethical absolutes do not  apply or don’t seem to apply very well.”
the truth is obviously somewhere in  between, but that doesn’t refute my assertion.
despite this, nearly all also use conventional methods,  and are satisfied with that.
some of it seems  contradictory.
if you found that washing soda and water worked just as well as your average floor cleaner with seventeen chemicals (and it does–i use it on our floors), is it really that terrible to change?
i have already written in opposition to practitioners pushing “natural remedies”or drugs of whatever ilk.
i see nothing wrong with that, even if the md disbelieves in both shamanism and religion.
in  fact, ka elsewhere is arguing the reverse, that while cam may be offering  placebo and other non-specific medical benefits these can equally well occur  within the 5-15 minute hurly-burly of the typical present day medical practice,  i am sure they can, with good doctors, but i would love to be quite sure about  the “equally”.
i get the  impression you weigh all silly, nonsense equally.
there are numerous quackademics at prestigious medical schools and elsewhere whose original motivations had nothing to do with dietary supplements, although in some cases those became part of their “programs” later, for obvious reasons.
and “prenatal trauma”?
a variation of this doctrine is  not vacuous but merely vapid: “fundamental to holistic medicine is the  recognition that each state of health and disease requires a consideration of  all contributing factors: psychological, psychosocial, environmental, and  spiritual.”
in relation to that we adopt the meanest, least flexible possible  position, even while lacking any clear evidence-based handle on the medical or  psychosocial benefits or the social functions of unconventional and folk  medical activity, or their risks.
perhaps i should be more  formal.
i know a lot about the claims themselves, about how to evaluate them, and about medical ethics and professionalism and what it takes to maintain them in the face of contradicting pressures.
i don’t quite agree with  that bald statement — there should be a rider specifying that this may  apply to *some* contexts where there is no obviously superior evidence-based  method.
some of them play a dominant part in the understanding of medicine in other societies, and some serve to qualify the conception of the physician as engineer even in our own society.

i think that one  of the down-sides to playing shaman and giving a placebo is that true  alternatives such as psychotherapy or a good exercise program are missed and  the person then ends up remaining tired and dragged out rather than making the  life-style changes that they need or participating in evidence-based  cognitive-behavioural therapy.
back to you, r: …and the reasons are many.
also, some of these outcomes, if as truly awful as implied, may be thought of as mainly exposing a puzzling lack of reach for more rational voices.

the holistic practitioner sees the body in much the same way that magicians  of old viewed the universe.
presently, scientific medicine is used by all major and probably most minor  cultures.

while it may have started in europe, the benefits of scientific  medicine were quickly realized by people all over the world.
sure, there is one now, and it’s undoubtedly an important part of the problem of irrational medical claims, but it’s not the only part
it’s true that there are many examples where ethical absolutes don’t seem to apply very well.
although the physician’s medical practice is not itself science, it is based on science and on training that is supposed to teach physicians to apply scientific knowledge to people in a rational way.
we have no basis on which to assume that similar benefits are not regularly occurring within cam, especially when a lot of people are telling us so.
several conceptions of “holism” have been developed in the writings of holistic practitioners and their advocates.

however, i also believe that to refuse to acknolwedge and  appreciate the huge pressure put on individual practitioners and institutions  by patients deceived by marketing geniuses indicates a failure to see a big  aspect of the problem.
# kimball atwood on 03 aug 2008 at 8:05 am rosemary, “woo” means “bullshit.”
as i read the report the pain abated, never to return to its previous  degree of severity.
i agree that in all contexts, some versions of fraud are more dangerous  than others.
the most important elements are that the practitioner be attentive and appear to give a damn.
as a patient, i have experienced two memorable examples of what i think of as “placebo effects.”
the first occurred at the age of 18  when, plagued by adolescent angst, i visited a psychiatrist exactly  once who told me, “you’re not crazy and you’re not going to  go crazy.”
quacks who are not physicians have also been kept in check, until recently, by governmental pressures.
if you are about to have major surgery, you may acquiesce to anything you think the surgeon approves of.
we have no basis on which to assume that similar benefits are not regularly  occurring within cam, especially when a lot of people are telling us so.
# qetzal on 01 aug 2008 at 12:44 pm dr. moran’s hypothetical about witch doctors struck me as  provocative, but after further consideration, i’m not sure it teaches us  anything new.
they are, mostly, the herbal medications and dietary recommendations that i’ve tried on myself and found effective, as well as yoga.
the key is that the patient has to request it and be of the same faith.

they also constantly quoted robert o. becker, md and his popular books.
i am very glad  dr. atwood sees him as a moral compass.
i will use silver as an example.
does informed consent enter into this even peripherally?
i found several articles by the  agency, the name escapes me, that preceeded the fda.
published: july 30, 1995 it is about mehmet oz, md, a cardiac surgeon the author says is highly regarded in his field at ny’s columbia-presbyterian.
imo, it is more like a belief in the myth  of the “good old days” when everything was simple and wonderful.
be reassured that looking at cam methods in strict cost/risk/benefit terms will definitely not change most of our judgments concerning cam.
what i’m trying unsuccessfully to bring out is that i feel completely disconnected with the majority of you because of your tone.
no, but a huge % of those in our culture, perhaps the majority, were  brought up to believe in nonsense.
but what do we mean by “works”?
dr. a, “point 3 also brings psychotherapy to mind.”
i use “woo” as a shorthand for implausible medical claims (imc).
the scots are an interesting case study.
i have not assumed, nor is the assumption inherent in ethical objections to physicians promoting ”cam,” that “conventional medicine has adequate answers to all health problems.”
what bothers me is the fraud used to sell it and i think that focusing on that we can help a lot of people.
-this is an interesting ethical debate within the medical community worth checking out.
i lost all respect for oz when he fell for an old carnival trick and  suggested that john of god was doing something to stimulate the pituitary when  he stuck forceps up a patient’s nose.
just as it would be problematic to ask a priest to visit a hospital patient who might be jewish (or atheist).
which brings me to this: in science-based medicine we are quite accustomed  to evaluating medical options in terms of benefits vs risks.
a much-repeated and trivial thesis, and moreover one that is said to characterize the sense in which holistic medicine is “holistic,” amounts to no more than this: mental and physical properties are interdependent.
as much as i hate playing the “you’re sick because society made you sick” card, i would never tell someone that they’re sick because they somehow brought it upon themselves.
this view is also context sensitive since considerable scientific evidence suggests the likelihood of symptom relief by the placebo medicines of cam and from interactions with cam practitioners.
that conventional medicine has adequate answers to all health problems and the public should be content with what it offers.
i also only mean products for which they make health claims.
i’ll try to answer some of your points.
it would be great if that law were repealed, and i’m sure we’d all be for it.
surveys routinely show that the majority of cam-using patients express great satisfaction with them.
on the other hand, being happy is a major component of recovery–i’ve lapsed on my reading on how the nervous system affects the immune system, but as of 2005 (the last year that i followed this closely) the studies seemed to to be pointing towards stress actually lowering immune cell counts and other objective measurements of immune function.
if that is too clumsy, i have no problem  with primitive medicine.
the  intentions of the seller are irrelevant and often unknowable.
the mere fact that  holistic medicine is widespread and enduring is no reason to take its claims  seriously; superstition, self-deception, stupidity, and fraud are ubiquitous  and always have been.
the reason is that it really doesn’t  discriminate if you remember that till not much more than 100 years ago  everyone including all the ancestors of everyone living today used primitive or  pre-scientific medicine and crude non-standardized remedies, some of which were  utterly useless, some dangerous and some just very unreliable.
i got a copy of his book which looks to me like a reputable textbook on colloid chemistry published in 1938.
dr ben goldacre’s placebo series on bbc radio 4, part 2 and part 1 touched on this issue but didn’t explore it.
aromatherapy–okay, smelling nice things does make one  happy, but beyond that i don’t think it’s actually effective as  medicine.
there is no reason, either historically or logically, to conceive of the  science used by physician engineers as necessarily physical science.
what i didn’t want to do was offend any devout christians, jews, muslims, or believers of any other religion by seeming to imply that their specific religious beliefs are no more credible than those of a primitive tribesman.
i mean, why are we obliged to consider the impact of our decisions upon the fate of the planets (or whatever) when this patient needs help?
if people feel better for taking a multivitamin or an innocuous herb, why should we care?
almost all “dietary supplement” marketing claims are woo, in that they are not backed by anything close to reasonable evidence.
any treatment content .
many patients will experience dramatic improvements in symptoms just by  finding out that whatever is causing them isn’t cancer or some other  serious illness—which reflects an underappreciated reality about the goal  of a diagnostic “workup”: not necessarily to determine what  something is, but always to determine what itisn’t.
medical training is supposed to make physicians good at applying scientific  knowledge to sickness, and it is also supposed to make medical doctors good at  acquiring through practice an abundance of tacit knowledge useful to their  craft.
the second occurred many  years later and was heralded not by a conversation, but by a diagnostic  test: after a couple of months of excruciating neck pain, i had a magnetic  resonance imaging (mri) study that showed that my cervical spine was  normal.
such banalities are often true and no  doubt sometimes ignored, with disastrous consequences, but they scarcely amount  to a distinctive conception of medicine.
glymour and stalker were prescient in their conclusion: if holistic-health advocates were content with encouraging sensible  preventive medicine or with criticizing the economic organization of american  medicine, we might be enthusiastic, but they are not.
i do have a response, however, and it has to do with the differences between some cultures and our own: the fallacy is that there are “similar inclinations.”
they illustrate how there can be a complete  disconnection between the benefits of medical interactions and their scientific  content, and, indeed.
as oz and others point out, many benefits arise from being able to reduce  pain without medication: patients are spared side effects like constipation and  stomach bleeding; they feel empowered having participated in their own  recovery; they can leave the hospital sooner.
i have previously asked this question which has to do with public policy  in relation to safe “alternatives”.
some of us (not me, because i find it boring) have written in opposition to the 1994 dshea law, which as you know opened the marketing floodgates for “supplements.”
# rjstan@together.net on 03 aug 2008 at 6:04 am am
the science seems to be indicating that if we let patients have their way with otherwise harmless things like crystals and incense (obviously not for an asthmatic!)

the same shelves boast best-selling books on holistic medicine authored by professors at distinguished medal schools and, in at least one case, by a physician administrator at the national institutes of health.
we may be able to do better with a change of tack  if that that might actually be more in touch with medical realities.
am i the only one who sees a difference in the role of a prosecutor and a scientist, the ftc and the fda?
if he wants to test the hypothesis that emotional and psychological factors affect the outcome of surgery, then he should test that hypothesis, not bring a ditzy magical thinker into the operating room to violate the privacy of the patient and to distract and embarrass the many other practitioners involved (if i were an anesthesiologist in such a situation, i’d refuse if asked and i’d be livid if i hadn’t been asked).
are you ok with “team atwood” making $$huge$$ profits selling “classic” thongs all over the internet?
if physicians cannot distinguish relevant from irrelevant factors, important from unimportant causes, then they can do nothing.
i believe this word was intended to describe a person not educated in ‘western’ science or medicine, and the challenges involved in communicating with such a person might certainly be daunting.
i suspect that if  you look at the names of the researchers in most major scientific institutions  and journals, you will find that a great many come from non-western cultures.
in last week’s post, i dubbed dr. peter moran the “conscience” of sbm, citing his commitment to doing what’s best for individual patients even if, in theory at least, that may involve some manner of benign but fanciful treatments.
even in this heyday of cam, very few of the public use cam exclusively.
it is far from the only one.
the reason i am being a bit stubborn about these matters is that i have what is as yet merely a vague inkling that they are important — that they may, despite initial appearances, help rather than damage our purposes.
that’s why i write what i write; i, like every  other activist, make the contribution that i’m good at making.
the warrant behind this  conception of the healer is tradition and “common knowledge.”
the intentions of the seller are irrelevant and often unknowable.

i think that  in addition to irrational beliefs there are psychological, emotional and  financial reasons why patients and mds resort to unscientific medicine.

i’m not aware that oz has even “tried” to do any controlled studies to show whether these alleged effects are real.
the standard healthfraud position is that even if cam may sometimes be helpful to people, it is a bad thing regarding which there can be no compromise.

those in our culture, with occasional exceptions, were not brought up to believe in “cam.”
we scientists are ever-so cautious when making scientific judgments about  complex matters; let’s not pretend that arriving at absolutes in medical  ethics is a piece of cake, especially when it is not quite clear how anything  done with the undiluted welfare of the individual patient in mind can be  entirely unethical.
there is a potential placebo effect involved in every  patient-practitioner interaction, and it needn’t require woo.
is it very different than the surgeon who in 1984 tried very hard to talk me into agreeing to have a masectomy to treat stage 1 breast ca because in spite of the big study just published showing that a lumpectomy and radiation are just as effective, he couldn’t believe it yet and wanted more studies to confirm that at least in his own mind?
depending on the condition, and with as much reluctance and regret as anyone here, my money would be on the practitioner who is not hamstrung by what science says, and in consequence has a confident explanation for everything and never runs out of remedies.
i laugh at most of  it, but i don’t laugh at fraud.
i don’t know if  there’s any way to make a rule on how far we should go.
exploring issues and controversies in the relationship between science and  medicine aug  01  2008 science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine, part 4: is “cam”  the only alternative?
but healthfraud has to also deal  with what a lot of other practitioners think and what our patients are often  trying out on their own initiative.
they cut and paste bad study after  bad study showing efficacy and tear apart good ones showing none and laugh all  the way to the bank which is exactly what they are paid to do, deceive people  to make money.
the essay discusses assertions that “ ‘all states of health and all disorders are considered to be psychosomatic’
i know a lot  about the claims themselves, about how to evaluate them, and about medical  ethics and professionalism and what it takes to maintain them in the face of  contradicting pressures.
holistic medicine is a pablum of common sense and nonsense offered by cranks and quacks and failed pedants who share an attachment to magic and an animosity toward reason.
he made motz part of his team and allowed her to introduce a macrobiotic diet, acupuncture, hypnosis, aromatherapy, changing light from fluorescent to incandescent, and cleaning the floors only with natural cleansers.
moving on to number 2: every pharmacy in europe that advertises  “homeopathie” is committing fraud, plain and simple.
as magicians, they possess magical powers either because of the occult knowledge they possess or simply because of who they are—for example, because they stand in some special relation to gods or demons.
is it  right to then turn around and say, well you didn’t really need these  things anyway, even denying them any relief that they may derive from  “pretend medicines”.
as you point out, you wouldn’t call in a priest to minister  to a jewish patient or an atheist, nor would you call in a rabbi to minister to  a catholic.
they’ll tend to be more knowledgable on average than the tribesman, but it’s a difference of degree, not kind.
sure, on its face it makes sense to use something that works without regard to why it works, but that’s a deceptive way to look at what oz, an enthusiastic big kid with a solid background in cardiac surgery but none in critical thinking, is doing: “return[ing] the practice of medicine to the practice of magic and…replac[ing] logic and method with occultism and obfuscation.”
another is that  they are magicians who exercise occult powers to bring about healing.
it is like stores that sell cigarettes.
if the tribesman wants it, and if the md judges that it’s safe and won’t interfere with the ‘real’ treatments, it’s pretty much analogous to a patient who wants to take homeopathy in addition to his ‘real’ medicines.
there is no reason, either historically or logically, to conceive of the science used by physician engineers as necessarily physical science.

he could sew bypass grafts and implant new hearts, but he was hard pressed to change the habits that put his patients on the operating table or to grapple with the emotional and psychological factors that might hasten their healing.
they know what we mean when we write “woo,” and they ought to feel the sting of the insult.
i hope you’ll agree with me that describing a person as ‘primitive’ (or ‘advanced’, for that matter) is not a medical or scientific judgment, but a value judgment.
the answer to point 3 is the same as the answer to point 2, and i certainly  don’t mind if “people feel better for taking a multivitamin or an  innocuous herb” (if that were the extent of “cam” we’d  hardly be wasting our time here).
the claims were not irrational.

my objection is to lying to the patient, implying that a treatment is supported by evidence when it really isn’t.
in relation to that we adopt the meanest, least flexible possible position, even while lacking any clear evidence-based handle on the medical or psychosocial benefits or the social functions of unconventional and folk medical activity, or their risks.
several conceptions of “holism” have been developed in the  writings of holistic practitioners and their advocates.

if you limit your exposes to irrational beliefs you will have a much  narrower audience and much smaller impact than if you expose fraud.
perhaps you  noticed that a few weeks ago i cited the naturopath’s bible, the textbook  of natural medicine (2nd edition, pizzorno and murray eds, edinburgh, churchill  livingstone, 1999) for having plugged colloidal silver, administered orally, as  a treatment for opportunistic infections in hiv+ patients (p. 1292).
i will not pull files.
my major objection, as i’ve written in my bio and elsewhere  on sbm, is to “implausible claims being promoted, tacitly or otherwise, by medical schools and government” and by physicians.

hartman appears to have been a chemist at an  indiana university.
the “general public” is not synonymous with “patients,” even if the latter are drawn from the former, but even if patients are victimized by themselves, it’s still up to an ethical physician to point that out.
if homeo “remedies” are traditional  there, i assume the public knows the theory behind them.
if congress is actually successful in giving the fda the power to regulate tobacco(a terrible idea, in my opinion, but for reasons that have nothing to do with this discussion), “supplement” companies and advocates won’t have a leg to stand on.
but certain combinations are impossible or extraordinarily unlikely.
false information requires a lot of investigation.
do you actually know this is true in the various  european cultures dr. moran referred to?
it seems we are prepared to pander to the superstitions of some cultures while despising any similar inclinations in our own.
the ethical card has some force, even when set against other primary ethical obligations of doctors towards their patients, but in reality it can only apply to that select few who have a clear enough grasp of the scientific evidence to be as certain as can be that any given cam treatment is a placebo.
if physicians  were more attentive to science and ethics and to explaining things to patients,  politicians, and the media, more people would know that.

one of the larger books of this kind was even subsidized by the national institute of mental health.
oz brought “healers” who use a “therapy” similar  to tt into the operating room to “treat” his patient during  surgery.
one hopes they will speak bluntly, but it does no good to join forces with cranks and quacks, magicians and madmen.
that recommendation is woo, and its fulfillment would be fraud.
that “alternative” methods do nothing worthwhile for those  using them, anyway.
if you are saying that you don’t think that the majority of people are using cam treatments, are you saying that you don’t consider “dietary supplements” cam?
dr. a, “there are plenty of modern physicians whose patients are not disposed to look elsewhere” if that were true, there wouldn’t be a billion $$ supplement industry.
(although i’ve lived in italy, spain and german, i never remember going into a pharmacy in europe.)
at columbia-presbyterian the presence of hands-on healers in an operating  room is only the most dramatic example of a new willingness to venture into the  terra incognita of healing.
perhaps in the rarifed air of aristotlian (sp?) logic one cannot conclude that that means that they are taking advise about medicine from people other than their physicians and leaving out their mds, but i think that if anyone did a serious study, they would find that that is exactly what it indicates.
she tells them they are bringing treatments such as  surgery into their lives in order to relive their traumas, including prenatal  traumas.
(i don’t have the book  opened and know i’m not getting the wording correct, but you get the  idea.)
that is the whole point of these posts, and why i disagree  with dr. moran that even a little “cam” is harmless.
point number 1 is simply incorrect.
i don’t believe in god and assume that most of you don’t either.

moreover, physician engineers have no immunity to moral or ethical constraints.

patients are not the problem; they are, if you’ll excuse the drama, the victims.
dr. a. quoted: “the holistic medical movement constitutes both a deliberate attempt to substitute a magical for an engineering conception of the physical and an attack on scientific understanding and reasoning
dr. a, “there are plenty of modern  physicians whose patients are not disposed to look elsewhere” if that were true, there wouldn’t be a billion $$ supplement  industry.
some of it seems contradictory.
dr. moran also added another comment, reproduced in part here: the ethical objection to all use of cam, as presented by ka, is problematic  because of the unspoken assumptions – 1.
i would also try hard to find out what oz is doing there now and what he has done since the article i cited was published in 1995.
“:-) in an equally joshing vein, it is not yet clear to the devil’s  advocate that he is entirely on the wrong track.
dr. b. he is a reputable silver researcher horrified by the way silver  quacks cite his work to promote supplements.
finally, i’d argue that in neither case should an md actively solicit  interventions that he knows to be useless, whether they be a witch  doctor’s potions or homeopathic remedies.
# rjstan@together.net on 02 aug 2008 at 9:32 pm dr. atwood, “but rosemary, you yourself are an example of a patient  who was a victim!”
the authors refute the charge that “the lack of evidence concerning the specific curative powers of holistic therapies is the result of a conspiracy of disinterest.”

even  seemingly benign practices, if implausible, can be harmful (“first, do no  harm”), particularly when promoted by someone who should know  better.
the alternatives to homeopathy for minor or self-limiting complaints, moreover, need not be “nsaids or antibiotics or antidepressants” unless there is a good reason for one of them.
no, but a huge % of those in our culture, perhaps the majority, were brought up to believe in nonsense.
is the resort to ethical argument about the use of placebo medicines a lazy  way of justifying such a globally rigid approach?
they are only committing fraud if they tell people that there is evidence  that homeo “remedies” work or that they contain active ingredients.
i don’t think he should be asked to do research certainly not  on the outcomes of psychological interventions.
dr. a, “every pharmacy in europe that advertises “homeopathie” is committing fraud, plain and simple.”
when discussing  quackery, i hate the skeptic’s use of the word woo because i think that  the people you should be trying to reach don’t understand it and when  they do they will think you are talking down your noses at them.
there is a potential placebo effect involved in every patient-practitioner interaction, and it needn’t require woo.
one cannot justify spending other people’s  money simply because one can imagine something to be true.
i countered with my own opinion that  honesty and integrity are necessary parts of any discussion with a  patient, and that they, in turn, must not conflict with science and reason.
because of such notions, …holistic practitioners…are under no obligation, they  believe, to reconcile their claims about therapy with what is known about the  causal pathways of the body.
however, many shamanistic cultures have incredibly  complex social networks and family structures (for example) that are by no  means ‘primitive’.
all the doctors i know would be prepared to call in the witch-doctor if it would help assuage the fears, or help in the management, of a seriously ill primitive tribesman.
i use honey instead of neosporin  on my cuts, and eat a largely vegetarian diet–not because i think  it’s healthier (which i do), but because i just happen to not like the  taste of meat.
# kimball atwood on 02 aug 2008 at 9:12 pm rosemary, here are more responses: all i’m trying to do is point out that the picture is much bigger  than “woo” and that the danger of snake oil is far greater than  accepting irrational beliefs.
what i’m trying unsuccessfully to bring out is that i feel completely  disconnected with the majority of you because of your tone.
# ben goldacre and placebo (part 2) radio 4:
but surely you can understand how emotionally comforting it must be for  people, especially terminally ill people and their loved ones, to believe they  are going to “heaven” forever.
take my word for it that every pharmacy in europe displays “homeopathie” (or language equivalents) in large letters outside.
when i heard that silver was being sold as a supplement, i asked the  salesmen how they knew it was safe and effective.
the main difference would be in the emphasis of argument and some of the rhetoric.
i’ve been know to say a thing or two about the irrationality of naturopathy — overall, what i call an ‘unethical sectarian pseudoscience’ — which also uses the ‘holistic’ label, and is quite a subterfuge (some new skeptical blog scribblings are here, http://naturocrit.blogspot.com/ ).
the experiments of dr. oz by chip brown;
on 10 nov 2008 at 2:00 pm [...] a great job examining the ethical implications of certain alternative  medicine practices, and has a terrific dialog with peter moran, a frequent  commenter here.
but healthfraud has to also deal with what a lot of other practitioners think and what our patients are often trying out on their own initiative.
the claim to diagnose by examining the eye or to cure by massaging the foot is completely bogus; we know more than enough about the workings of the body to be reasonably certain that geometric features of the iris, for instance, do not provide the specific information about disorders that iridologists claim they do….of course, it is conceivable that the beliefs of scientific medicine are in error about one or another of these matters, but that is no reason for using public funds to investigate holistic claims.
it is they who have embarrassed science and medicine, and who have  violated the public trust.
patients who suffer  from coronary heart disease may be treated with beta blockers and antiplatelet  drugs, and they may also be advised to change their work, their diet, their  smoking habits, their exercise habits, and their living conditions.
by not addressing that, you argue, we sbmers don’t have a chance to make much difference.
# kimball atwood on 02 aug 2008 at 9:55 pm rosemary, first, excuse me for not having read your latest comment before posting my  own.
dr. a, “by your own description, there was no “dietary supplement industry” as it now exists when your doctor treated you with silver.
i am talking  about feelings and perceptions here, things i get the impression skeptics have  difficulty dealing with, things i think have to be used to communicate with the  general public.
[pelletier 1977]“  and that “the entire body (and psyche) can be treated or diagnosed  through the treatment or observations of a special part of the anatomy.”
they are only committing fraud if they tell people that there is evidence that homeo “remedies” work or that they contain active ingredients.
oz brought “healers” who use a “therapy” similar to tt into the operating room to “treat” his patient during surgery.
we expect skilled engineers to be able to learn from experience and to get better at building bridges, because we believe that their training has subjected them to a rational discipline that has made them good learners about such matters.
dr. a, “every pharmacy in europe that advertises “homeopathie” is committing fraud, plain and simple.
i could give you many more examples, but will limit myself to one more  often offered as a reference by today’s silver quacks, robert j. harman.
the difference between us is that i insist that medicine is about an infinite number of individual contexts and i see many examples where ethical absolutes (actually these are ethical guidelines rather than directives) do not apply or don’t seem to apply very well.
many patients, perhaps most, expect honesty and integrity,  and have a pretty good sense of when they see it and when they don’t.
if that is too clumsy, i have no problem with primitive medicine.
while it may have started in europe, the benefits of scientific medicine were quickly realized by people all over the world.
i was objecting to the  use of the term ‘primitive’ to refer to a *person* (the  hypothetical tribesman, in this case), rather than to a belief.
while i appreciate this thoughtful discussion (and the website in general),  i must take issue with the adjective “primitive” as used to  describe a hypothetical patient with shamanistic beliefs.
in 1978, a group of  medical and osteopathic physicians formed the american holistic medicine  association, which now publishes a journal and whose meetings have been  recognized for education purposes by the american medical association.
at times,  physicians may find themselves in sympathy with the holistic movement, because  some fragment of the rhetoric rings true, because of certain practices and  attitudes they encounter in their daily work with colleagues and patients, or  because of dissatisfaction with the economic and social organization of  medicine.
perhaps in the rarifed air of aristotlian (sp?) logic one  cannot conclude that that means that they are taking advise about medicine from  people other than their physicians and leaving out their mds, but i think that  if anyone did a serious study, they would find that that is exactly what it  indicates.

i was born in 1942 and have articles from med journals older than i am lying about the safety and efficacy of silver drugs, articles older than i am warning doctors about the fraud and fraudulent ads older than i am.
i think that it is the general public that has gotten  politicians, doctors and scientific institutions to offer cam and that it was  the marketers in the dietary supplement industry that got the public to do that.
far more people are concerned about and can recognize fraud than irrational  beliefs.
the subjects are people rather  than bridges, but in many respects the professions of medicine and engineering  are alike.
and i think that focusing on that we can help a lot of people.
the therapies described and recommended in a typical book of the  genre include biofeedback, hypnosis, psychic healing, chiropractic, tai chi,  iridology, homeopathy, acupuncture, clairvoyant diagnosis, human auras, and  rolfing.
school needs money and is looking for “alternatives” to bring it in.
there were ads that made it look as if he were alive and well and working today.
they had a column in jama reporting their investigations and warned about henry and his buddies and their articles several times.
if a surgeon doing a high risk operation suspects that having a wacky woman wave her hands over the patient during the proceedure will calm the patient and seriously decrease the amount of depression she experiences afterwards, something he suspects will improve her chances of a good outcome, and invites the wacky woman to proceed, is that very different than a doctor at his wits end with a seriously ill person trying something he believes can’t possibly help, but using it because he has heard stories that it does?
we normally try to quantify them so that we can reach a reasonable balance.
my point about the failure of psychotherapy is that human beings have emotional and psychological needs that aren’t being met in today’s society although i don’t really know that they were ever met and i certainly don’t think that we should expect medicine to meet those needs, but i do think we should expect practitioners of scientific medicine to realize that humans have emotional and psychological needs, many of which are not being met.
if the claim were valid,  holistic practice would have to constitute a scientific tradition, albeit one  in competition with the tradition of orthodox medicine.
my  mother bought it at the pharmacy.
that’s how we normally operate.
the  science seems to be indicating that if we let patients have their way with  otherwise harmless things like crystals and incense (obviously not for an  asthmatic!)
rosemary, this is exactly what my last 3 posts have been about.
the alternatives to  homeopathy for minor or self-limiting complaints, moreover, need not be  “nsaids or antibiotics or antidepressants” unless there is a good  reason for one of them.
those who we might wish to influence in various ways may not have sufficient familiarity with science and medicine to be able to articulate the line of argument i am developing (it is difficult enough for me and i know i have a long haul ahead of me even if i am entirely right), but one of the reasons for our distressing inability to have the influence we desire may well be that people of ordinary intelligence and experience can nevertheless almost instinctively sense the weaknesses and exaggerations in some of our habitual arguments.
science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine, part 4: is  “cam” the only alternative?
if they feel talked down to (assuming any of them even reads this stuff), that’s fine with me.
i am not prepared to go that far, although i think i  understand why some doctors might do that.
depression, for instance, has emerged as one of the major risk factors in the recovery of heart patients after surgery.
and: the physician as expert  consultant” # harriet hall on 01 aug 2008 at 11:10 am excellent post with much food for thought and some great sound bites.
we  definitely do not yet have entirely safe and 100% effective solutions to all of  mankind’s ills, and certain imperfections of everyday medical practice  can heighten the risks of the use of unnecessarily powerful pharmaceuticals.
rosemary, i’m not quite sure what you are saying.
(i don’t have the book opened and know i’m not getting the wording correct, but you get the idea.)
their newfoundendorsement by governmental edict is no more justified than would be a similar endorsement of tribal witch doctors.
the subjects are people rather than bridges, but in many respects the professions of medicine and engineering are alike.
# l_s_olabisi on 06 aug 2008 at 3:20 pm for dr. moran and others, let me clarify my remark.
it seems we are prepared to pander to the superstitions of  some cultures while despising any similar inclinations in our own.
in places it seems that you can’t take “yes” for an answer.
this applies fairly well  to some illnesses but not many others.
if you think cam is only about woo, imo you are very wrong, and you  won’t be able to do a lot to combat quackery and snake oil because very  few people besides skeptics will listen to you.
a variation of this doctrine is not vacuous but merely vapid: “fundamental to holistic medicine is the recognition that each state of health and disease requires a consideration of all contributing factors: psychological, psychosocial, environmental, and spiritual.”
dr. oz now appears frequently on oprah.
many mentioned henry crookes, md.
they had a column in jama  reporting their investigations and warned about henry and his buddies and their  articles several times.
i am not prepared to go that far, although i think i understand why some doctors might do that.
that is deceptive and since there is not a tradition of use here, i doubt that many in the general public would buy them if they knew the truth about them.
science, reason, ethics, and modern medicine, part 4: is “cam” the only alternative?
many quacks are themselves physicians with no acceptable  excuse, who until recently were kept in check by strong professional and  governmental pressures, only to have found themselves reborn in a new “ golden age of quackery.”
another doctrine said to be holistic is that one’s state of health is  affected by everything.
we don’t care that they may be being used mainly when  there is no entirely satisfactory evidence-based treatments for the complaint,  nor that some of the methods may simply have not yet been subjected to  sufficient study to be quite sure whether they have intrinsic medical activity  or not.
i remained an adolescent for some time, but i sure felt a hell of a lot better.
i don’t  agree that “cam” affects the majority of people in the sense that  they are using “cam” treatments.
the ethical card has some  force, even when set against other primary ethical obligations of doctors  towards their patients, but in reality it can only apply to that select few who  have a clear enough grasp of the scientific evidence to be as certain as can be  that any given cam treatment is a placebo.
some doctors who use cam recognize this and try  to use it to benefit the patient.
the rest of the stuff (the psychobabble) is pure crap.
just as it would be problematic to ask a priest  to visit a hospital patient who might be jewish (or atheist).
although the physician’s medical practice is not itself  science, it is based on science and on training that is supposed to teach  physicians to apply scientific knowledge to people in a rational way.
aromatherapy–okay, smelling nice things does make one happy, but beyond that i don’t think it’s actually effective as medicine.
pharmacies selling cigarettes perhaps should be embarrassing to pharmacists, but at least every customer knows what they are.
as  far as i’m concerned people and doctors can do what they want to  themselves and consenting adults but they have to be honest about it.
they illustrate how there can be a complete disconnection between the benefits of medical interactions and their scientific content, and, indeed.
is it  very different than the surgeon who in 1984 tried very hard to talk me into  agreeing to have a masectomy to treat stage 1 breast ca because in spite of the  big study just published showing that a lumpectomy and radiation are just as  effective, he couldn’t believe it yet and wanted more studies to confirm  that at least in his own mind?
and i think that focusing on  that we can help a lot of people.
# rjstan@together.net on 06 aug 2008 at 7:28 pm how about pre-scientific medicine?
i agree with you that there is “a very nasty epidemic out there called cam.”

we definitely do not yet have entirely safe and 100% effective solutions to all of mankind’s ills, and certain imperfections of everyday medical practice can heighten the risks of the use of unnecessarily powerful pharmaceuticals.
i do agree in the sense that it  squanders public money, dupes medical students, perverts the public perception  of science and medicine, etc.
the key is that the patient has to request it and be of the  same faith.
but contrary to my initial impression, i don’t think the witch doctor example reveals anything new.
because many patients become the victims of quackery does not negate the  fact that the epidemic of cam we are now experiencing started with the general  public and worked its way up to scientific institutions.
false information requires a lot of  investigation.
as oz and others point out, many benefits arise from being able to reduce pain without medication: patients are spared side effects like constipation and stomach bleeding; they feel empowered having participated in their own recovery; they can leave the hospital sooner.
i’m not aware that oz has even “tried” to do any  controlled studies to show whether these alleged effects are real.
i’ve been know to say a thing or two about the irrationality of  naturopathy — overall, what i call an ‘unethical sectarian  pseudoscience’ — which also uses the ‘holistic’ label,  and is quite a subterfuge (some new skeptical blog scribblings are here, http://naturocrit.blogspot.com/ ).
i don’t think that  “cam” is only about woo; i think that “cam”is woo.
they are, mostly,  the herbal medications and dietary recommendations that i’ve tried on  myself and found effective, as well as yoga.

am i really the only one who sees a huge difference between lying to make money, even when you know that your lie can result in harming people, and promoting nonsense that you actually truly believe in like “energy medicine” or prayer for the prevention and cure of disease?
in julie motz’s book she says oz credited her with the success when  a transplanted heart started beating, saying he didn’t know what she did  in there, but he’d never seen a heart come back so fast.
another is that they are magicians who exercise occult powers to bring about healing.
popular  bookstores are filled with works on “holistic medicine,” many  edited by medical doctors and some recommended by such political eminences as  edward kennedy and george mcgovern.
the [...] # durvit on 26 aug 2008 at 10:24 am holistic medicine is a pablum of common sense and nonsense offered by  cranks and quacks and failed pedants who share an attachment to magic and an  animosity toward reason.
i am a strong believer in evidence based medicine and i have great respect for the authors on this site for their incredible knowledge, intelligence, talent and high ethical standards, but i think there is a very nasty epidemic out there called cam affecting the majority of people in many industrialized countries.
in julie motz’s book she says oz credited her with the success when a transplanted heart started beating, saying he didn’t know what she did in there, but he’d never seen a heart come back so fast.
but the  same thing applies to ‘modern’ patients.
the basis for that recommendation was a single report of silver used as a preservative.
finally, i’d argue that in neither case should an md actively solicit interventions that he knows to be useless, whether they be a witch doctor’s potions or homeopathic remedies.
that is deceptive and  since there is not a tradition of use here, i doubt that many in the general  public would buy them if they knew the truth about them.

i’m not sure what you mean by this.
if people feel better for taking a  multivitamin or an innocuous herb, why should we care?
such candor serves to maintain my view of him as our “conscience,” even as it makes me optimistic that we might dissuade him from making those positions permanent.

[...] [...] a great job examining the ethical implications of certain alternative medicine practices, and has a terrific dialog with peter moran, a frequent commenter here.
depending on the condition, and with as much  reluctance and regret as anyone here, my money would be on the practitioner who  is not hamstrung by what science says, and in consequence has a confident  explanation for everything and never runs out of remedies.
is there another, holistic, conception of medicine distinct from those  described above?
far more people are concerned about and can recognize fraud than irrational beliefs.
all we know, having completely dismissed all the anecdotal evidence, is that they usually don’t work obviously better than placebo when put to the test in the banal environment of the typical controlled trial.
perhaps i should be more formal.
some of us (not me,  because i find it boring) have written in opposition to the 1994 dshea law,  which as you know opened the marketing floodgates for  “supplements.”
second, i think that if oz is the  talented surgeon claimed and if he enjoys doing surgery, that that is what he  should do.
[a] philosophers clark glymour and douglas stalker contributed a  classic paper on this issue: engineers, cranks, physicians, magicians.
behind the usual healthfraud position there is both an exaggeration of the capacity of modern medicine and insufficient recognition of the harm that it can do.
he’d contact a site, they’d remove the reference and two more sites  would pop up using it.
those in our  culture, with occasional exceptions, were not brought up to believe in  “cam.”
all we know, having completely dismissed all  the anecdotal evidence, is that they usually don’t work obviously better  than placebo when put to the test in the banal environment of the typical  controlled trial.
i know i promised to drop the subject.
be reassured that looking at cam methods in strict cost/risk/benefit terms  will definitely not change most of our judgments concerning cam.
i don’t quite agree with that bald statement — there should be a rider specifying that this may apply to *some* contexts where there is no obviously superior evidence-based method.
you seem to think i am talking about doctors promoting cam or placebo treatment as a matter of policy.
if you think cam is only about woo, imo you are very wrong, and you won’t be able to do a lot to combat quackery and snake oil because very few people besides skeptics will listen to you.
we may be able to do better with a change of tack if that that might actually be more in touch with medical realities.
there were articles praising his products in the  lancet and the british medical j among others by several different doctors.
