for the children, western medicine is more effective.people usually try to see the good doctors, therefore if there is an emergency, you may not be able to make an appointment with them.but our chinese mums will tell our children what is right and then ask them to follow it and not to make mistakes.but there are many cases in taiwan when chinese medicine killed the patients.the biggest difference between western medicine and chinese medicine is that, for western medicine, you will see the result in a few days, but for chinese medicine, it may take a few months, you have to wait.you have money, you can afford to see a doctor or to be ill.they help them to do what they can't do at home.ice-cold food is not good for asthma.generally, western medicine is effective, but people say drugs are not good.we chinese have the concept that bringing up children to help with their old age.you have a stable income, that is very important, and you can live very healthily, i think (laugh).i think that is because of the fresher air, a lot of space, a slower pace of life, so people here live longer.this is why many foreigners visit taiwan and have the impression that chinese people are very warm-hearted.but for the chronic illnesses, i think chinese medicine is better.the medicine was expensive and the cost was not covered by the nhs, i paid for it myself.
