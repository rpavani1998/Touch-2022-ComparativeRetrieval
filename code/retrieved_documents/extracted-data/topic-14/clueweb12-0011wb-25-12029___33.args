in a recent personal correspondence, one medical anthropologist told me that the notion that science has developed a more objective and accurate image and understanding of the universe than any other system of knowing is a "discredited post-enlightenment myth."
they certainly show up time and again in their literature.
to her great credit, dr. mccorkle is perhaps the only contributor to schoen and wynn's "alt-vet-med" opus to employ a fully rational definition of "holistic" and/or "holism."
while it's possible that "traditional healers" may occasionally, in their efforts to eliminate "heat" or "cold," or foil demons or "evil winds," may stumble upon therapeutic interventions that actually help, the process is haphazard at best.
its eradication will ultimately save millions of third world lives, and it was accomplished entirely by means of plain old "conventional western" science and medicine.
as others have observed, this bizarre situation undoubtedly stems in large part from the fact that, in view of the stunning successes of science and technology in the decades following wwii, the subjective musing and "theories" (conjectures) of sociologists, cultural anthropologists, literary critics, and other scholars in the "arts and humanities" seemed ever more arcane and irrelevant.
in other words, it's a means of "taking the universe apart to see how it works."
"ethnomedicine" gave us opium - a mixture of at least 20 alkaloids, not codeine.
females are also regarded to be less vulnerable to illness than male children, meaning that less elaborate measures are necessary to protect their health.
eighty traditional physicians were specifically selected to control the plague.
ethnopathophysiology: how people understand the interrelationship, functions, and malfunctions of different organs and systems (e.g., circulatory, nervous), often garnered from practical necropsy at slaughter or ritual sacrifice.
therefore they collected and administered only the sap, instead of following the farmer's practice of feeding the whole fruit.
it passed "peer review" by five members ofsocial text's editorial board, and was published as a serious piece of scholarship.
rather than addressing the inherent deficiencies in their belief systems, some cultural and medical anthropologists have, instead, focused their energies on discrediting legitimate science under the rubric of cultural relativism.
on the basis of prior experiments and review of the pharmacologic literature, scientists knew the key parasitacidal constituent resided mainly in the fruit sap.
dr. mccorkle seems convinced that, for whatever reason, "conventional western" science is incapable of employing an "interdisciplinary" approach to medical and herd health issues in the third world.
sooner or later, the intended beneficiaries of "ethnoveterinary medicine" and "ethnoscience" are going to figure out that these "disciplines," unlike their bona fide scientific alternatives, are not only examples of the "western 'etic'" proponents so adamantly disparage, they're based on the intellectually bankrupt anti-science dogma of cultural constructivism and post-modernism.
as we'll see, in the context of erd&e, the term "research" refers not to the critical scientific investigation of traditional or folk medical practices, but to their "judgment-free" investigation and "validation" in accordance with the tenets of cultural anthropology.
interestingly, the historiography of agricultural inventions and recommendations at international agricultural research centers reveals that many of these derive directly from producer knowledge and practice.
it would be unfair and incorrect for me to suggest that cultural anthropology and ethnomedicine played no part in the struggle to eliminate smallpox.
(and, by the way, they vividly illustrate the fact that the "value-free, judgment-free" ethic of cultural relativism doesnot extend to western european culture.)
it gave the world invaluable drugs such as aspirin, codeine, curare, and quinine [.]well, not exactly.
the author is clearly committed to the "ethnoscientific tenet" that any local belief, no matter how irrational or steeped in the supernatural, is really a "scientific concept."
like it or not, all things being equal, dressings made of cow feces simply don't work as well on an open wound as antibiotics and sterile dressings do.
if one understands that seizures are due to paroxysms of neuronal discharge, it leads one to look for ways to stabilize neuronal physiology.
weil also argues that the lesser concentration of an active constituent present in plant tissue renders such a drug safer to use.
the folk illnesses urana (fright) and larpa explain child deaths in culturally acceptable ways, and the types of funerals given to children of different ages indicate that the death of young children is not considered unusual.
while it's true that science often employs elaborate and highly specialized jargon, it does so in the interest of precision.
ethnographic data on child illness, gender, and developmental concepts help to explain why children of different genders and ages may be treated differently in the rural andes.
in any case, i'm certain that advocates of scientific biomedicine share my conviction that various "traditional medical systems" merit rigorous but open-minded scientific evaluation.
this epistemic charity dehumanizes us by denying us the capacity for a reasoned modification of our beliefs in the light of better evidence made available by the methods of modern science.
unfortunately, she doesn't tell us what the "ethnomedically correct" response might be when a skeptical "western" medical practitioner's "ethnomedical practitioner-colleague" suggests treating a lacerated patient with a cow-feces dressing.
on the other hand, we would almost certainly have far more serious problems to contend with such as nationwide famine and almost universal poverty, since industrial agriculture would be impossible.
the fact is that competent scientists, by their training, do their best not to overlook any pertinent data.
while she concedes in passing that specific "western" pharmaceutical agents may be somewhat more effective than herbs or crude plant extracts, she goes out of her way to suggest that "western science-based medicine" has repeatedly failed to perform as well as its "ethnomedical" counterpart in dealing with such problems.
the fact is, agricultural science has evolved and significant recommendations have been made for growers and "stockraisers" based on dispassionate scientific evaluation of the data.
the average veterinarian might read this and assume that dr. mccorkle is surely going to suggest the obvious: that carefully designed scientific studies and field work are called for.
the first couple of times i read this passage, i assumed that the author merely meant that the idiom sometimes is unscientific or supernatural.
" ethnodiagnostic knowledge and technique: based on all the above factors, plus clinical observation of signs and syndromes, how people decide what the given health care problem is and thus how to treat or control it.
for instance, pre-scientific experience with selective breeding of domestic animals played a major part in the development of modern genetics.
it's understanding why the condition exists and knowing what to do about it that really counts.
they claim that apart from their active principle, plants may contain other substances that enhance their therapeutic action by some sort of a synergistic process.
female children are valued less because of their future social and economic potential.
in each of these five instances, however, she is quick to point out allegedly similar failures in "conventional" veterinary medicine - lest we conclude that "ethnoveterinary medicine" and "conventional veterinary medicine" are not equally "valid" and effective healthcare delivery systems.
the facts are as follows: "ethnomedicine" gave us not aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid, but the bitter glycoside salicin in the form of willow bark.
thus provincialized, science is deemed acceptable for certain limited and purely instrumental purposes, with no claims to truth, worldviews, and social values.
ds in various "liberal arts" and "social studies" disciplines, very few of them seem to be scientists.
unfortunately, she doesn't tell us what the "ethnomedically correct" response might be when a skeptical "western" medical practitioner's "ethnomedical practitioner-colleague" suggests treating a lacerated patient with a cow-feces dressing.
for example, china has only one modern medical doctor for every 10,000 patients, but the tradition of traditional practitioners is 1:100 (bodecker 1994a); for ghana and swaziland, these figures are respectively 1:20,000 versus 1:200 and 1:10,000 versus 1:100 (zhang, 1994).
in other words, she is suggesting that "conventional western" scientists are destined to always overlook a significant portion of the pertinent data.
the folk illnesses urana (fright) and larpa explain child deaths in culturally acceptable ways, and the types of funerals given to children of different ages indicate that the death of young children is not considered unusual.
while dr. mccorkle and erd&e-advocate colleagues are clearly very keen on "studying" traditional veterinary practices and veterinary folk medicine, only once in the course of her chapter does she mention, in passing, the need to "discriminate" between effective and ineffective therapies: pg. 734: for local knowledge to be broadly and responsibly put to use, some means of discriminating between effective and ineffective methods is required.
"ethnobotanists" gave us quinine in the form of cinchona bark and bark extract.
734: ethnomedicine itself provides an excellent example of such processes [the integration of "conventional" science and "ethno" science].
it means that the scientific method is invalid.
i submit that they rarely if ever work as well as scientific biomedical interventions, at least on a "level playing field."
moreover, it's quite clear that the erd&e movement has at least as much to do with the "extension" (promotion) of a philosophical, social, and even political agenda as it does with helping "stockraisers" make a living.
differences were especially significant in the allocation of biomedical treatments, the most costly in terms of parental time, effort, and money.
of course, science is obliged to ignore "mechanisms" for which there isn't a shred of objective evidence.
of course, not understanding science and believing in magic are helpful if one hopes to hold such a view.
on page 736, dr. mccorkle tells us: finally, investments in the study and application of useful local knowledge, practice and social organization can produce another important benefit: renewed respect for local cultures and technologic knowledge.
chemists discovered aspirin in 1899, learning to synthesize it from coal tar.
while it's true that science often employs elaborate and highly specialized jargon, it does so in the interest of precision.
the holistic, interdisciplinary study of local knowledge and its associated skills, practices, beliefs, practitioners, and the social structures pertaining to the healthcare and healthful husbandry of food-, work-, and other income-producing animals, always with an eye to practical development applications within livestock production and livelihood systems and with the ultimate goal of increasing human well-being via increased benefits from stock raising.
that's fine with me, and i sincerely hope they are able to do so.
dietary pesticides (99.99% all natural), in proc.
(in fact, they are still struggling with such issues as how best to employ - or not employ - antibiotics in livestock husbandry.)
all systems may 'work'; in practice, all have successes and failures, with some systems scoring much higher in particular areas of medicine, depending on the social, cultural, and economic context in which they are applied, as well as on their biomedical bases.
on the other hand, while they might be obliged to reject local as well as "western" notions of supernatural or metaphysical etiology, i don't think any good scientist is likely to dismiss out-of-hand the observations that have led folk medicine practitioners to do what they do.
believe it or not, under the tenets of ethnomedicine, "possession by demons" or "an excess of abdominal foam" are both perfectly acceptable "ethnoscientific" diagnoses for what ethno-scientifically unsavvy "western" healthcare professionals might identify as a case of idiopathic epilepsy.
the fact that what used to be merely the study of "veterinary folk medicine" has been transmogrified into the much more impressive-sounding "ethnoveterinary research, development and extension" speaks volumes about the proliferation of semantics and taxonomies in this field.
the quechua "ethnodiagnosis" for infectious keratoconjunctivitis is perhaps correct, if one defines correct as identifying that there is a problem in the eye of the sheep.
salicin works reasonably well as an antipyretic, but is extremely rough on the gi system - much more so than aspirin.
while neither bona fide scientists nor cultural anthropologists can "command the clock to stop" for anyone, i'm all in favor of doing whatever can be done, within reason, to help pastoral, hunter-gatherer and similarly low-tech cultures maintain their chosen lifestyles into the 21st century.
understandably the gift givers are dismayed to have their generosity interpreted as charity, their ethnosciences seen as antiscience, and their invitation to be different read as intellectual apartheid.
in such a fashion, regularly identifying that a person had epilepsy, but attributing the cause to possession by the devil, would most likely be a proper "ethnodiagnosis."
so far as i'm aware, ethnoveterinary science advocates are not lobbying western farmers and stockraisers to forgo modern science and technology in favor of 19th and 18th century alternatives.
generally speaking, science, social philosophies and political agendas - no matter how well intentioned -- have made exceedingly poor bedfellows.
"modern 'western' science, yes, but modern universal science, no!" could well summarize the prevailing ethnoscience/postcolonial position.
for a highly revealing and absolutely hilarious insight into the façade of post-modernist and cultural constructivist jargon and puffery, i refer readers to the "sokal affair.
that's a tough break for the little kids, and especially the little girls in peru, who have to die as a result.
in short, stockraisers are mainly interested in whether a given intervention makes sense to them and works to their satisfaction (and then, of course, whether it is available, affordable, convenient, and so forth) - no matter what its source.
in any case, i'm certain that advocates of scientific biomedicine share my conviction that various "traditional medical systems" merit rigorous but open-minded scientific evaluation.
what the "ethnoscience advocates" apparently refuse to accept is that informal observation and trial-and-error findings do not, in and of themselves, constitute a "science" - least of all when they are mixed with a hodge-podge of local magical and religious beliefs.
and, since the disease isn't caused by infectious agents, neither western veterinary practitioners nor third world "ethnoveterinarians" will want to waste time or money on heretofore effective topical and cheap antibiotics.
they say it is impolite to look a gift horse in the mouth.
(i realize that at least some cultural anthropologists have lamented and even tried to resist this "tide" within their fields.
moreover, it's quite clear that the erd&e movement has at least as much to do with the "extension" (promotion) of a philosophical, social, and even political agenda as it does with helping "stockraisers" make a living.
in the ethnoscientific worldview, there are no objective facts or realities, only local "cultural constructs" of same.

i submit that they rarely if ever work as well as scientific biomedical interventions, at least on a "level playing field."
likewise, chemical fertilizers may be more expensive than livestock manure, but they are vastly more effective on a per-unit-of-weight basis and much less likely to result in the transmission of salmonella, e. coli, and other pathogens to human or animal consumers.
females are also regarded to be less vulnerable to illness than male children, meaning that less elaborate measures are necessary to protect their health.
a person who took powdered cinchona bark would also ingest the alkaloid quinidine, a cardiac depressant, and cinchotannic acid, which would induce constipation.
if traditional systems had worked well in the west, there would have been no incentive or need to develop scientific biomedicine in the first place.
we won't know which, if any, "ethnomedical alternatives" are safe, effective, environmentally friendly and economically sound until we scientifically investigate them one at a time.
the only person who was able to help was a young cambridge-trained doctor, wu lien-te, who used his scientific knowledge to direct the sanitary and public health measures required to prevent the plague from spreading further.
the traditional treatment consists merely of periodically feeding the sheep whole, immature papaya fruits.
perhaps most maasai people want to remain "simple pastoralists."
i suspect that "over my dead body, you quack" would be construed as demonstration of "hegemonic, imperialist, oppressive, close-minded, and ethnophobic" disrespect toward a "fellow health professional."
they claim that apart from their active principle, plants may contain other substances that enhance their therapeutic action by some sort of a synergistic process.
also, it's inaccurate and disingenuous to characterize all "'first world' drugs and agrochemicals" as "highly residual and poisonous."
[.] by defining the very nature of rationality and truth as internal to social practices, social constructivists do indeed give the natives their "permission" to be different - but, then, so did apartheid.
the problem is that, in the real world, such a diagnosis doesn't help - at least not when one is hoping to deliver effective health care.
fortunately, there is apparently no need to subject urine therapy and mud or fecal dressings to randomized controlled trials: dr. mccorkle assures us that these therapeutic interventions "can and do work."
in fact, most of us would be engaged in subsistence farming, absorbed from sun-up to sun-down, seven days a week, in backbreaking manual labor, and hoping desperately to avoid starvation and survive the next epidemic of vaccine-preventable human and livestock disease.
for example, china has only one modern medical doctor for every 10,000 patients, but the tradition of traditional practitioners is 1:100 (bodecker 1994a); for ghana and swaziland, these figures are respectively 1:20,000 versus 1:200 and 1:10,000 versus 1:100 (zhang, 1994).
(please pay no attention to the jet aircraft roaring overhead, the electronic telecommunication devices all around you, or the fact you somehow managed not to die from smallpox or polio while growing up.
they provide a context in which to interpret health care allocation data, and, in the absence of a population-based study, reinforce findings based on the limited study sample.
real science works on the "assumption of naturalism": i.e., that the universe makes sense, functions free of magical or incomprehensible influences from outside itself, and is at least potentially understandable.
if one hopes to systematically investigate illnesses and efficiently develop effective therapies, there simply is no substitute for an accurate, science-based understanding of anatomy, physiology, and the etiology of disease.
as one reads erd&e literature, it becomes increasingly clear that the real message has little to do with instituting effective medical or husbandry techniques and much to do with "validating" status quo social and cultural conventions and practices and promoting ethnophobic anti-western and anti-scientific sentiment in third world countries.
indeed, cultural anthropology and the sub-specialty of medical anthropology, have - to a large extent -- attempted to gain the cache (if not literally become) genuine sciences, not by actually living up to the standards of science or proceeding on scientific principles, but merely by defining themselves as sciences.
real science works on the "assumption of naturalism": i.e., that the universe makes sense, functions free of magical or incomprehensible influences from outside itself, and is at least potentially understandable.
conversely, what most scientists would construe as "local religious or metaphysical belief systems" and "traditional or folk medicine" are consistently described as "ethnoscience" and "ethnomedicine." pg.
on the basis of prior experiments and review of the pharmacologic literature, scientists knew the key parasitacidal constituent resided mainly in the fruit sap.
above all, they reject [the premise] that there exists a real-world (mind- and theory-independent) physical domain whose properties are the object of scientific knowledge and whose better understanding is the prime source of technological advance.
in each of these five instances, however, she is quick to point out allegedly similar failures in "conventional" veterinary medicine - lest we conclude that "ethnoveterinary medicine" and "conventional veterinary medicine" are not equally "valid" and effective healthcare delivery systems.
732: finally, because people are usually more familiar with indigenous medicines, they may be less likely to misuse or abuse these preparations than with alien western drugs.
such research is not only costly, but reductionistic because traditional prescriptions are often intended to produce simultaneous or synergistic actions such as site-specific attack on the disease, enhanced immune response, increased cellular uptake, and repression of side effects.
a review of dr. constance mccorkle's chapter 41: "ethnoveterinary medicine" by robert imrie, dvm dr. constance mccorkle begins her chapter on "ethnoveterinary medicine" by telling us that ethnoveterinary research, development and extension (erd&e), has emerged as a "fertile field" that promises to benefit "rural and peri-urban stockraisers" not just in the third world, but everywhere, by virtue of the "generation (or regeneration)" of certain "animal health technologies" she and her colleagues define ethnoveterinary research, development and extension as: pg. 713:
a person who took powdered cinchona bark would also ingest the alkaloid quinidine, a cardiac depressant, and cinchotannic acid, which would induce constipation.
on the other hand, we would almost certainly have far more serious problems to contend with such as nationwide famine and almost universal poverty, since industrial agriculture would be impossible.
(and citing examples where scientific biomedicine is incompetently applied or unavailable doesn't count.)
for the benefit of non-cultural-anthropologists, "reductionism" is the intellectual tool by which scientists attempt to understand complex phenomena and things by "reducing" them to their constituent parts and underlying principles.
a few of the more avant garde intellectuals of the movement have even made the earth-shattering discoveries that all knowledge is subjective and therefore arbitrary and that objective reality, itself, is an illusion.
ethnopathophysiology: how people understand the interrelationship, functions, and malfunctions of different organs and systems (e.g., circulatory, nervous), often garnered from practical necropsy at slaughter or ritual sacrifice.
in a matter of hours, 80% of the sheep in the high-dosage experiment group and 20% in the medium-dosage group died of acute poisoning.
in real science, experimental results don't always conform to the experimenter's expectations.
the fact that what used to be merely the study of "veterinary folk medicine" has been transmogrified into the much more impressive-sounding "ethnoveterinary research, development and extension" speaks volumes about the proliferation of semantics and taxonomies in this field.
one of the most fundamental assumptions of ethnomedical philosophy (if not cultural anthropology in general) is that, even though third world peoples seem overwhelmingly eager to join in the scientific revolution and enjoy the abundant fruits of modern science and technology, they should be "spared the negative impact such fruits are certain to incur on their cultures."
their ethnodiagnosis of the condition is nevertheless 100% accurate.
we wouldn't be using "new-fangled" antibiotics anyway, so "resistance" would be a "non-problem."
it passed "peer review" by five members ofsocial text's editorial board, and was published as a serious piece of scholarship.

in 1820, chemists were responsible for isolating and purifying it into a therapeutic agent safer and more effective than unprocessed bark or crude extract.
"ethnoscientists" gave us arrows poisoned by extract from various plant species.
to her great credit, dr. mccorkle is perhaps the only contributor to schoen and wynn's "alt-vet-med" opus to employ a fully rational definition of "holistic" and/or "holism."
merely recognizing that a condition exists, and being able to recognize it regularly, isn't really the problem.
my food-animal veterinary practitioner colleagues will, i'm sure, be fascinated to learn that infectious keratoconjunctivitis has nothing to do with mycoplasma, rickettsia or chlamydia, and everything to do with "hot and cold diseases" and "evil winds."
all these benefits can add up to a fresh sense of local confidence and control, stronger social structures, andempowerment of people to work together at the local level - whether independently or with nonhegemonic formal-sector support - to solve more of their own development problems.
alexander macdonald offers an interesting insight into "western" (scientific) versus "traditional" models of medical delivery from the fountainhead of "ethnomedicine," china: [10] [.] 60,000 people died in manchuria of a plague between 1910 and 1911.
i suspect that conventional "western" and even "third world" veterinarians share dr. mccorkle's and my eagerness to "integrate what works in folk medicine" with "what works in scientific biomedicine."
to the contrary, rather than viewing these casual findings and local beliefs as a starting-point for genuine scientific investigation, they attempt to construe them as the end-product of a scientific process.
while this is indeed the case in the rational world, "ethnoscience" not only isn't a part of the rational world, it denies the very existence of objective reality.
here is report from the medical literature which casts the practices of dr. mccorkle's quechua "ethnoscientists" and "ethnomedical practitioners" in a somewhat different light:[8] the data suggest a pattern of discrimination against females and younger children, especially infants under age one, despite the fact that these groups were reported to be sicker.
(and, by the way, they vividly illustrate the fact that the "value-free, judgment-free" ethic of cultural relativism doesnot extend to western european culture.)
if they did, wouldn't it follow that all traditional interventions should not only "work," but work just as well as "western" (scientific biomedical) interventions.
all these materials can (and do) work as intended, but they also pose risks of secondary infection.
it's ironic that, just as this chapter was coming into print, the millennia-old scourge of smallpox was finally being eliminated from the face of the earth.
perhaps, if this "cultural anthropology thing" really gets going, we westerners can sharpen our harpoons and "get back into the business."
apparently she has spent many years in third world countries studying such matters from an anthropological perspective, so i'm willing to assume, for the moment, that such interdisciplinary scientific efforts have either not been widely attempted or have not been particularly successful in the past.
furthermore, while dr. mccorkle speaks of "validating" traditional veterinary practices, she doesn't seem at all eager to advocate discarding such practices when they're shown to be ineffective, or to refine and develop those that pass scientific muster.
http://www.soz.uni-hannover.de/isoz/sokal/math.htm [2] rosen r. a physics prof drops a bomb on the faux left.
this, of course, makes "ethnoveterinary science and knowledge" a "non-falsifiable belief system."
if one believes that seizures are caused by "an excess of abdominal foam" (as do traditional healers in cameroon),[5] it leads one to attempt to stop or reduce "foam secretion."
this is not the place for an exegesis on the sociology of knowledge or the universality of the scientific method, however.
as we'll see, in the context of erd&e, the term "research" refers not to the critical scientific investigation of traditional or folk medical practices, but to their "judgment-free" investigation and "validation" in accordance with the tenets of cultural anthropology.
kenyan farming communities, for example, typically boast two or three traditional healers for livestock but no formally-trained veterinary workers.
as many experts have observed, the western model for delivery of animal health services has rarely worked well in developing countries.
finally, he contends that the various active constituents in a plant work synergistically to produce a total effect greater than the mere sum of the individual component activities.
(for reasons known only to themselves, unfortunately few post-modernist intellectuals have chosen to prove the point by jumping out of airplanes without parachutes.)
therefore they collected and administered only the sap, instead of following the farmer's practice of feeding the whole fruit.
believe it or not, under the tenets of ethnomedicine, "possession by demons" or "an excess of abdominal foam" are both perfectly acceptable "ethnoscientific" diagnoses for what ethno-scientifically unsavvy "western" healthcare professionals might identify as a case of idiopathic epilepsy.
effective ethnopharmaceuticals may pose fewer dangers than do the more highly residual, poisonous, concentrated, and unfamiliar drugs and agrochemicals of the first world.
of course, the author of this paper was undoubtedly "biased" in favor of "western" science and against "ethnoscience."
they certainly show up time and again in their literature.
in a matter of hours, 80% of the sheep in the high-dosage experiment group and 20% in the medium-dosage group died of acute poisoning.
it's curious to note that, in the previous passage, dr. mccorkle refers to "iberian notions" of hot and cold disease and "incaic concepts" of evil winds.

many modern paraherbalists maintain that plants are not only the safest way to administer medicine, but also the most effective.
kenyan farming communities, for example, typically boast two or three traditional healers for livestock but no formally-trained veterinary workers.
the thoughtful among them take seriously the charge of condescension and deny that respectfully understanding others' beliefs implies a suspension of critical judgment.
the flaws of conventional science make [.] the need to scientifically validate local knowledge and practice controversial.
the gift givers thus assure us that they are not against modern science per se, but only against its universal pretensions.
many of the most prominent post-modernist "theorists" appear to be quite proud of the fact that they are "untainted" by any scientific training whatever - as though not learning about science from other scientists and not being able to actually do science are somehow key to truly understanding it.
none of this is to say that ethnoscience is perfect or that conventional science must be abandoned.
of course, in the cultural constructivist universe of cognitive anthropology, one doesn't have to worry about facts, because there are no absolute facts - only "relative" ones.
"ethnoscientists" gave us arrows poisoned by extract from various plant species.
we wouldn't be using "new-fangled" antibiotics anyway, so "resistance" would be a "non-problem."
while she concedes in passing that specific "western" pharmaceutical agents may be somewhat more effective than herbs or crude plant extracts, she goes out of her way to suggest that "western science-based medicine" has repeatedly failed to perform as well as its "ethnomedical" counterpart in dealing with such problems.
as many experts have observed, the western model for delivery of animal health services has rarely worked well in developing countries.
(and citing examples where scientific biomedicine is incompetently applied or unavailable doesn't count.)
it means that the scientific method is invalid.
the very suggestion is antithetical to both the spirit and the principles of genuine scientific investigation.
if one hopes to systematically investigate illnesses and efficiently develop effective therapies, there simply is no substitute for an accurate, science-based understanding of anatomy, physiology, and the etiology of disease.
aspirin and other synthetic salicylates soon completely displaced compounds obtained from natural sources.
dr. mccorkle may be unaware of the fact that while natural and sythetic toxins actually present similar inherent risks, animal and human exposure to natural toxins is much higher than to synthetic ones.[6],[7]
and who would deny the self-evident fact that the observations of pastoralists, herbalists, and folk medicine practitioners sometimes "point a finger" leading to the discovery and development of new husbandry techniques, pharmaceuticals and healthcare technologies?
like it or not, all things being equal, dressings made of cow feces simply don't work as well on an open wound as antibiotics and sterile dressings do.
if traditional systems had worked well in the west, there would have been no incentive or need to develop scientific biomedicine in the first place.
these hold that whereas genuine science is "just another way of obtaining knowledge" and merely a "western cultural construct," traditional and folk medical systems are not only "sciences" in and of themselves, but deserve higher status and should command greater authority than "outsider" (etic) "western" science.
modern synthetic antimalarial drugs, however, are less toxic and more effective than quinine, and have largely replaced it.
in practice, methodological difficulties have been especially common in the study of botanicals [.]
all sciences are ethnosciences, and none is more universally true than any other.
if, in the 1930s and 40s, we in the west had chosen to eschew chemical fertilizers, we certainly would not be dealing with the nitrate runoff problems we currently face.
sometimes it's neither possible, nor desirable, to maintain the cultural status quo.
ds in various "liberal arts" and "social studies" disciplines, very few of them seem to be scientists.
differences were especially significant in the allocation of biomedical treatments, the most costly in terms of parental time, effort, and money.
when one reads the speakers lists for symposia on medical anthropology and the names of faculty or board members of pertinent organizations, one is likely to be immediately struck by the dearth or complete absence of physicians (m.d.s), scientific biomedical health professionals and scientists.
certainly it would be shortsighted to suggest that the observations and ideas of witchdoctors, shamans and other traditional healers should be "dismissed out-of-hand."
[.] isolation of active ingredients should not be a precondition for the validation of ethnopharmaceuticals.
for instance, pre-scientific experience with selective breeding of domestic animals played a major part in the development of modern genetics.
for instance, when cost or lack of availability preclude the use of more safe and effective modern pharmaceuticals, it makes sense to exploit herbal or traditional
unfortunately for all involved (except, of course, the whales), the world changed unexpectedly, and these traditional whalers had to find another means of making a living.
moreover, the erd&e movement seems to embody the "vision" of a small group of western intellectuals who hope to impose a particular philosophy and dogma on said healthcare delivery systems.
unfortunately, since no author or source is cited for this anecdote, we'll probably never know the answers to these questions.
that's precisely where genuine science excels.
after all, these methods have "worked" for peruvians for countless generations.
in fact, the terms seem to be favored elements of "insider jargon" among cultural anthropologists.
[.]"ethnomedicine advocates" are clearly bent on abolishing such terms as "folk medicine," "traditional medicine," "shaman," "curandero" or even "witchdoctor"?
modern synthetic antimalarial drugs, however, are less toxic and more effective than quinine, and have largely replaced it.
"western" veterinarians can presumably forget about controlling the vectors of the disease since the vector turns out to be "evil wind" rather than flies.
in 1820, chemists were responsible for isolating and purifying it into a therapeutic agent safer and more effective than unprocessed bark or crude extract.
the flaws of conventional science make [.] the need to scientifically validate local knowledge and practice controversial.
all these benefits can add up to a fresh sense of local confidence and control, stronger social structures, andempowerment of people to work together at the local level - whether independently or with nonhegemonic formal-sector support - to solve more of their own development problems.
young children are thought to have a loose body-soul connection, making them more vulnerable to illness, and are though to be less human than older individuals.
if they did, wouldn't it follow that all traditional interventions should not only "work," but work just as well as "western" (scientific biomedical) interventions.
aspirin and other synthetic salicylates soon completely displaced compounds obtained from natural sources.
if one understands that seizures are due to paroxysms of neuronal discharge, it leads one to look for ways to stabilize neuronal physiology.
finally, investments in the study and application of useful local knowledge, practice and social organization can produce another important benefit: renewed respect for local cultures and technologic knowledge.
in the ethnoscientific worldview, there are no objective facts or realities, only local "cultural constructs" of same.
for the benefit of non-cultural-anthropologists, "reductionism" is the intellectual tool by which scientists attempt to understand complex phenomena and things by "reducing" them to their constituent parts and underlying principles.
moreover, in this and other medical anthropological and cultural constructivist literature, what modern scientists know as "science" is consistently described as "western science" or "conventional science," and it is generally described as having "failed" in most "third world" contexts.
it gave the world invaluable drugs such as aspirin, codeine, curare, and quinine [.]
that where no formally-trained veterinarians exist, somebody is going to move in to try to "help."
i suspect that conventional "western" and even "third world" veterinarians share dr. mccorkle's and my eagerness to "integrate what works in folk medicine" with "what works in scientific biomedicine."
" ethnodiagnostic knowledge and technique: based on all the above factors, plus clinical observation of signs and syndromes, how people decide what the given health care problem is and thus how to treat or control it.
consider the pertinent comments of professor of pharmacognosy, varro e. tyler:[9 ] [.] isolation of active ingredients should not be a precondition for the validation of ethnopharmaceuticals.
merely recognizing that a condition exists, and being able to recognize it regularly, isn't really the problem.
effective ethnopharmaceuticals may pose fewer dangers than do the more highly residual, poisonous, concentrated, and unfamiliar drugs and agrochemicals of the first world.
on the other hand, dr. mccorkle hasn't offered any coherent reason to assume that properly designed scientific approaches to these issues should not work.
in other words, investigators were obliged to assiduously resist the temptation to evaluate such cultures in relation to western culture.
it would seem, at best, patronizing for western "ethnomedicine advocates" to suggest that "third world stockraisers" might be any less capable of learning how to effectively cope with such introductions than their western antecedents.
consider the pertinent comments of professor of pharmacognosy, varro e. tyler:[9 ] many modern paraherbalists maintain that plants are not only the safest way to administer medicine, but also the most effective.
cultural constructivists insist that all science, all facts, all knowledge, and even reality itself are merely subjective "cultural constructs," and that one is no more "valid" than any other.
scientific testing, while perhaps "ethnoincorrect," actually provides a means of determining what works and what doesn't.
the western scientific etic is really just another emic.
upon careful reading of the above passage, one notices that the mortality rate in the "low-dosage" group is not mentioned.
while it's possible that "traditional healers" may occasionally, in their efforts to eliminate "heat" or "cold," or foil demons or "evil winds," may stumble upon therapeutic interventions that actually help, the process is haphazard at best.
732: finally, because people are usually more familiar with indigenous medicines, they may be less likely to misuse or abuse these preparations than with alien western drugs.
of course, no medical delivery system has worked very well in developing countries.
humans, livestock, local fauna, and the environment stand to benefit from ethnomedical alternatives.
salicin works reasonably well as an antipyretic, but is extremely rough on the gi system - much more so than aspirin.
if one believes that seizures are caused by "an excess of abdominal foam" (as do traditional healers in cameroon),[5] it leads one to attempt to stop or reduce "foam secretion."
the problem is that, in the real world, such a diagnosis doesn't help - at least not when one is hoping to deliver effective health care.
under the tenets of erd&e, when and if "ethnoveterinary science and knowledge" fail to pass rigorous scientific muster, it doesn't mean they aren't "valid" (whatever that means.)
weil also argues that the lesser concentration of an active constituent present in plant tissue renders such a drug safer to use.
at least until the 19th century, when western anatomical knowledge became available, chinese medical practitioners held that the trachea communicated not with the lungs, but with the abdomen.
dr. mccorkle seems to think that "conventional western" scientists are inherently incapable of considering the subjective, informally gathered anecdotal data offered by indigenous non-scientist farmers, pastoralists and healers.
the most aggressive consumers of ethnoscience are the equally "left" post-colonial intellectuals and activists associated with cultural/religious and other "new social movements" that aim to purge their cultures of all alien (mostly western) elements.
"ethnomedicine" gave us opium - a mixture of at least 20 alkaloids, not codeine.
the holistic, interdisciplinary study of local knowledge and its associated skills, practices, beliefs, practitioners, and the social structures pertaining to the healthcare and healthful husbandry of food-, work-, and other income-producing animals, always with an eye to practical development applications within livestock production and livelihood systems and with the ultimate goal of increasing human well-being via increased benefits from stock raising.
in practice, methodological difficulties have been especially common in the study of botanicals [.]this is simply fatuous rubbish.
in fact, most of us would be engaged in subsistence farming, absorbed from sun-up to sun-down, seven days a week, in backbreaking manual labor, and hoping desperately to avoid starvation and survive the next epidemic of vaccine-preventable human and livestock disease.
eighty traditional physicians were specifically selected to control the plague.
in any case, when on page 729 and again on page 733 dr. mccorkle refers to "lacunae in ethnoveterinary knowledge," i'm pretty sure she means there are "holes in ethnoveterinary knowledge" (i.e., that traditional animal healers don't have all the answers).
734: ethnomedicine itself provides an excellent example of such processes [the integration of "conventional" science and "ethno" science].
the quechua "ethnodiagnosis" for infectious keratoconjunctivitis is perhaps correct, if one defines correct as identifying that there is a problem in the eye of the sheep.
certainly it would be shortsighted to suggest that the observations and ideas of witchdoctors, shamans and other traditional healers should be "dismissed out-of-hand."
the idea was that, in order to truly understand such cultures, one must examine them on an entirely "value free" basis.
finally, he contends that the various active constituents in a plant work synergistically to produce a total effect greater than the mere sum of the individual component activities.
for example, cinchona bark contains some 25 closely related alkaloids, but the only one recognized as useful in the treatment of malaria is quinine.
we won't know which, if any, "ethnomedical alternatives" are safe, effective, environmentally friendly and economically sound until we scientifically investigate them one at a time.
and, since the disease isn't caused by infectious agents, neither western veterinary practitioners nor third world "ethnoveterinarians" will want to waste time or money on heretofore effective topical and cheap antibiotics.
of course, the author of this paper was undoubtedly "biased" in favor of "western" science and against "ethnoscience."
i'm sure that ethnoscience advocates would be aghast at the western ethnocentric notion that the time time-tested ethnoscientific techniques of female infanticide and female subordination and ethnoscientific knowledge regarding disease vulnerability of female children should be thrown out in favor of contraception, increased access to western medicine, and western notions of sexual egalitarianism.
the traditional treatment consists merely of periodically feeding the sheep whole, immature papaya fruits.
all systems may 'work'; in practice, all have successes and failures, with some systems scoring much higher in particular areas of medicine, depending on the social, cultural, and economic context in which they are applied, as well as on their biomedical bases.
we can only guess what "mechanisms" dr. mccorkle feels science has "overlooked."
the single great "truth" cultural constructivists and post-modernists have to offer is that "western" science is really nothing special.
i also suspect that attempting to make them aware of the "germ theory of infection" would be construed as blatant ethnocentric imperialist indoctrination.
for instance, when cost or lack of availability preclude the use of more safe and effective modern pharmaceuticals, it makes sense to exploit herbal or traditional therapeutic agents likely to be safe and at least marginally effective.
that's a tough break for the little kids, and especially the little girls in peru, who have to die as a result.
so far as i'm aware, ethnoveterinary science advocates are not lobbying western farmers and stockraisers to forgo modern science and technology in favor of 19th and 18th century alternatives.
that where no formally-trained veterinarians exist, somebody is going to move in to try to "help."
all these materials can (and do) work as intended, but they also pose risks of secondary infection.
since bona fide science is an inherently flexible rather than dogmatic method, integrating such data and sources of information should pose no insurmountable problems.
after all, these methods have "worked" for peruvians for countless generations.
ethnomedicine advocates insist that local medical practices and husbandry techniques offer great potential benefit to local farmers and pastoralists, and that local knowledge and expertise should take precedence over that stemming from "outside" cultures.
here's what dr. mccorkle has to say about the role of science, and the "limitations" of science, in evaluating ethnomedicine: pg. 735: at another level, experiences in human ethnomedicine suggest that researchers using conventional scientific methodologies may overlook some mechanisms by which natural medicines produce their effect.
the average veterinarian might read this and assume that dr. mccorkle is surely going to suggest the obvious: that carefully designed scientific studies and field work are called for.
conversely, what most scientists would construe as "local religious or metaphysical belief systems" and "traditional or folk medicine" are consistently described as "ethnoscience" and "ethnomedicine." pg.
likewise, the notion of the "supernatural" is antithetical to true science (as distinct from pseudoscience).
presumably she felt that more readers would understand "lacunae" than would understand "holes." function: adjective etymology: phonemic date: 1954 : of, relating to, or involving analysis of linguistic or behavioral phenomena in terms of the internal structural or functional elements of a particular system cognitive anthropology has repeatedly demonstrated a basic structural similarity in the two types of knowledge.
moreover, in this and other medical anthropological and cultural constructivist literature, what modern scientists know as "science" is consistently described as "western science" or "conventional science," and it is generally described as having "failed" in most "third world" contexts.
from this perspective, all that has really happened to western culture since the enlightenment is that we've traded one type of "ethnoscience" for another, and the latter version is not one whit "better" or more inherently effective than the former.
in such a fashion, regularly identifying that a person had epilepsy, but attributing the cause to possession by the devil, would most likely be a proper "ethnodiagnosis."
a mathematician reads social text.
the only person who was able to help was a young cambridge-trained doctor, wu lien-te, who used his scientific knowledge to direct the sanitary and public health measures required to prevent the plague from spreading further.
at least until the 19th century, when western anatomical knowledge became available, chinese medical practitioners held that the trachea communicated not with the lungs, but with the abdomen.
chemists discovered aspirin in 1899, learning to synthesize it from coal tar.
the core of the problem, of course, is that real science tends to work, and most "other ways of knowing" - including social and political "sciences" and cultural anthropology - tend not to work very well, or at least they fail to yield tangible and consistent results.
they assert that these are examples of a collaboration between just two of many "co-equal sciences," and that "western" science plays no privileged part in the relationship and deserves no particular credit for the results.
likewise, the notion of the "supernatural" is antithetical to true science (as distinct from pseudoscience).
health care allocation and ethnographic data suggest that selective neglect (passive infanticide) may be occurring in rural peru, possibly as a means of regulating family size and sex ratio.
the fact is that many non-residual rapidly and spontaneously self-degrading pesticides have been developed and marketed in recent decades - as a direct result of just the concerns dr. mccorkle cites.
while this is indeed the case in the rational world, "ethnoscience" not only isn't a part of the rational world, it denies the very existence of objective reality.
in fact, the terms seem to be favored elements of "insider jargon" among cultural anthropologists.
in 1998, the washington post carried an article about china's parasitism problem.[11] apparently 70% of rural chinese are parasitized, primarily by various species of worms, resulting in malnutrition, decreased intelligence and general weakening of the work force.
while dr. mccorkle and erd&e-advocate colleagues are clearly very keen on "studying" traditional veterinary practices and veterinary folk medicine, only once in the course of her chapter does she mention, in passing, the need to "discriminate" between effective and ineffective therapies: pg.
perhaps dr. mccorkle can tell us which "traditional medical systems" even conceptualized an immune system or the cellular nature of living tissue before these entities were discovered and articulated by "western" science.
i'm willing to assume, at least for the sake of argument, that most quechua people, australian aborigines, and most other aboriginal peoples want to maintain their current lifestyles.
[off-set box 41-10] traditional vs. modern pharmacology: in 1994 a set of on-station trials was mounted in indonesia to validate local javanese treatment for ovine endoparasitism, with the goal of making a commercial version for the market.
the western and third world critics of the universality of science are united in reversing the terms of respect in sandra harding's statement quoted earlier; that is, they want to value local concerns and knowledge and delegitimize outside experts, assuming all the while that the local and the outside are irreconcilable and that the knowledge of the "outside" experts - that is, modern science - is nothing more than an imposition on reluctant local knowers.
female children are valued less because of their future social and economic potential.
perhaps it would be more "ethnomedically correct" to suggest a poultice comprised of 50% cow feces and 50% antibiotic ointment.
these theories hold that, because modern "western" science is but one among many ways of understanding the world and is embedded in its own cultural context of production as other knowledges are in theirs, it cannot serve as a transculturally valid source of knowledge.
dressing up folk medicine as "ethnomedicine," and shamans as "ethnoscientists," then equating them with scientific biomedicine and scientists merely obfuscates these facts by means of insipid jargon.
to the contrary, these two "disciplines" have significantly impacted the effort, but not in a way most readers might anticipate.[13] frederique apffel marglin, a well-known anthropologist from a well-known american university, with the full endorsement of india's foremost social scientists, recently declared that the eradication of smallpox from india using modern cowpox-based vaccine was an affront to the local custom of variolation, which included inoculation with human smallpox matter accompanied by prayers to the goddess of smallpox, sitala devi.
the first couple of times i read this passage, i assumed that the author merely meant that the idiom sometimes is unscientific or supernatural.
furthermore, while dr. mccorkle speaks of "validating" traditional veterinary practices, she doesn't seem at all eager to advocate discarding such practices when they're shown to be ineffective, or to refine and develop those that pass scientific muster.
to the contrary, rather than viewing these casual findings and local beliefs as a starting-point for genuine scientific investigation, they attempt to construe them as the end-product of a scientific process.
likewise, chemical fertilizers may be more expensive than livestock manure, but they are vastly more effective on a per-unit-of-weight basis and much less likely to result in the transmission of salmonella, e. coli, and other pathogens to human or animal consumers.
apparently, people solving their own local development problems is ethno-politically ok, but only so long as they don't resort to "hegemonic" governmental or "western" institutions - i.e., those institutions that depend upon real science, with its objective reality, absolute truths, and concrete facts.
while they might not realize it, most readers here, and virtually all scientists, are rational positivists and modernists.
for a highly revealing and absolutely hilarious insight into the façade of post-modernist and cultural constructivist jargon and puffery, i refer readers to the "sokal affair.
perhaps it would be more "ethnomedically correct" to suggest a poultice comprised of 50% cow feces and 50% antibiotic ointment.
alexander macdonald offers an interesting insight into "western" (scientific) versus "traditional" models of medical delivery from the fountainhead of "ethnomedicine," china: [10] [.] 60,000 people died in manchuria of a plague between 1910 and 1911.
upon careful reading of the above passage, one notices that the mortality rate in the "low-dosage" group is not mentioned.
in any case, if a "theory" or "intellectual system" assumes the reality of magic or supernatural forces, no matter what you call it, it isn't "science.
professor of philosophy, christopher norris, has observed that cultural relativist literature has been much more widely and enthusiastically embraced by "cultural theorists and socio-historians of science" than has positive rationalist alternatives.
in other words, it's a means of "taking the universe apart to see how it works."
in any case, if a "theory" or "intellectual system" assumes the reality of magic or supernatural forces, no matter what you call it, it isn't "science.
i would be the first to concede that these are examples of non-scientist, informal observers providing science and scientists with invaluable information, but that is not what dr. mccorkle and her colleagues are claiming.
as a corollary, formal-sector health care workers, extensionists, educators, scientists, and policymakers may also gain increased appreciation of the knowledge and experience that their clients, students, users and citizens already possess.
my food-animal veterinary practitioner colleagues will, i'm sure, be fascinated to learn that infectious keratoconjunctivitis has nothing to do with mycoplasma, rickettsia or chlamydia, and everything to do with "hot and cold diseases" and "evil winds."
dressing up folk medicine as "ethnomedicine," and shamans as "ethnoscientists," then equating them with scientific biomedicine and scientists merely obfuscates these facts by means of insipid jargon.
ethnographic data on child illness, gender, and developmental concepts help to explain why children of different genders and ages may be treated differently in the rural andes.
health care allocation and ethnographic data suggest that selective neglect (passive infanticide) may be occurring in rural peru, possibly as a means of regulating family size and sex ratio.
young children are thought to have a loose body-soul connection, making them more vulnerable to illness, and are though to be less human than older individuals.
the very suggestion is antithetical to both the spirit and the principles of genuine scientific investigation.
here is report from the medical literature which casts the practices of dr. mccorkle's quechua "ethnoscientists" and "ethnomedical practitioners" in a somewhat different light:[8] the data suggest a pattern of discrimination against females and younger children, especially infants under age one, despite the fact that these groups were reported to be sicker.
a review of dr. constance mccorkle's chapter 41: "ethnoveterinary medicine" by robert imrie, dvm dr. constance mccorkle begins her chapter on "ethnoveterinary medicine" by telling us that ethnoveterinary research, development and extension (erd&e), has emerged as a "fertile field" that promises to benefit "rural and peri-urban stockraisers" not just in the third world, but everywhere, by virtue of the "generation (or regeneration)" of certain "animal health technologies" she and her colleagues define ethnoveterinary research, development and extension as: pg. 713:
what many non-scientists fail to appreciate is that such informal long-term observation often provides a key impetus and essential starting point for genuine scientific investigation.
it does not follow, however, that hummingbirds are spacecraft.
and who would deny the self-evident fact that the observations of pastoralists, herbalists, and folk medicine practitioners sometimes "point a finger" leading to the discovery and development of new husbandry techniques, pharmaceuticals and healthcare technologies?
humans, livestock, local fauna, and the environment stand to benefit from ethnomedical alternatives.
as a corollary, formal-sector health care workers, extensionists, educators, scientists, and policymakers may also gain increased appreciation of the knowledge and experience that their clients, students, users and citizens already possess.
dr. mccorkle may be unaware of the fact that while natural and sythetic toxins actually present similar inherent risks, animal and human exposure to natural toxins is much higher than to synthetic ones.[6],[7]
in all the examples she cites, the problems involved would seem to be entirely amenable to the skills of parasitologists, epidemiologists, agronomists, pharmacologists, phytopharmacognosists and other scientists working in concert with scientific bio-medical practitioners, economists, sociologists, and anthropologists.
in real science, experimental results don't always conform to the experimenter's expectations.
it would seem, at best, patronizing for western "ethnomedicine advocates" to suggest that "third world stockraisers" might be any less capable of learning how to effectively cope with such introductions than their western antecedents.
the facts are as follows: "ethnomedicine" gave us not aspirin, which is acetylsalicylic acid, but the bitter glycoside salicin in the form of willow bark.
(in fact, they are still struggling with such issues as how best to employ - or not employ - antibiotics in livestock husbandry.)
rational positivists hold that there is such a thing as objective reality, that the universe is at least potentially understandable, that it is subject to immutable physical laws, and, like their modernist brethren, that the european enlightenment and post-enlightenment discoveries of galileo, kepler, newton, dalton, kelvin, maxwell, planck, heisenberg and einstein have resulted in an ever-more accurate image of the universe and an ever-deeper understanding of how the universe works.
also, it's inaccurate and disingenuous to characterize all "'first world' drugs and agrochemicals" as "highly residual and poisonous."
" if one really takes a close look at the "ethnoscience" and "ethnomedicine" literature, one learns that that not only are practitioners of "western" scientific biomedicine "of no more or less benefit to patients" than shamans and witchdoctors (i.e., "ethno-medical practitioners and ethnoscientists"), they differ only in thekinds of healing magic they administer.
of course, modern science has been so wildly successful that it's only feasible to effectively malign and depreciate it if one willfully mischaracterizes and misapprehends it.
i also suspect that attempting to make them aware of the "germ theory of infection" would be construed as blatant ethnocentric imperialist indoctrination.
also, it's worth noting that hummingbirds share a "basic structural similarity" with the space shuttle.
(actually, this is not entirely true: many cultural relativists and post-modernists are happy to disparage anything and everything they view as "western" - especially science.)
what many non-scientists fail to appreciate is that such informal long-term observation often provides a key impetus and essential starting point for genuine scientific investigation.
under the tenets of erd&e, when and if "ethnoveterinary science and knowledge" fail to pass rigorous scientific muster, it doesn't mean they aren't "valid" (whatever that means.)
if, in the 1930s and 40s, we in the west had chosen to eschew chemical fertilizers, we certainly would not be dealing with the nitrate runoff problems we currently face.
they provide a context in which to interpret health care allocation data, and, in the absence of a population-based study, reinforce findings based on the limited study sample.
i suspect that "over my dead body, you quack" would be construed as demonstration of "hegemonic, imperialist, oppressive, close-minded, and ethnophobic" disrespect toward a "fellow health professional."
this, of course, makes "ethnoveterinary science and knowledge" a "non-falsifiable belief system."
apparently, people solving their own local development problems is ethno-politically ok, but only so long as they don't resort to "hegemonic" governmental or "western" institutions - i.e., those institutions that depend upon real science, with its objective reality, absolute truths, and concrete facts.
they wish science to confess its culture, take on an ethnic middle name (western) and become one among many other ethnosciences.
such a project only demands, they claim, that every society should use criteria that are internal to its own "specific historical tradition," for the criticism of its own knowledge and values.
it is indeed doubly impolite if the gift was intended as a token of respect and solidarity.
they assert that these are examples of a collaboration between just two of many "co-equal sciences," and that "western" science plays no privileged part in the relationship and deserves no particular credit for the results.
generally speaking, science, social philosophies and political agendas - no matter how well intentioned -- have made exceedingly poor bedfellows.
cultural constructivists seem to prefer broad philosophical, magical and metaphysical understandings of the universe which are not based on objective and systematic examination of constituent parts and underlying physical laws.
"western" veterinarians can presumably forget about controlling the vectors of the disease since the vector turns out to be "evil wind" rather than flies.
in 1998, the washington post carried an article about china's parasitism problem.[11] apparently 70% of rural chinese are parasitized, primarily by various species of worms, resulting in malnutrition, decreased intelligence and general weakening of the work force.
more specifically, such a specialized and intentionally impenetrable language allows "insiders" to identify one another as such, and creates the impression among "outsiders" that "insiders" enjoy special knowledge and expertise, and have a deeper understanding of the pertinent issues than "uninitiated" others.
for example, cinchona bark contains some 25 closely related alkaloids, but the only one recognized as useful in the treatment of malaria is quinine.
more specifically, such a specialized and intentionally impenetrable language allows "insiders" to identify one another as such, and creates the impression among "outsiders" that "insiders" enjoy special knowledge and expertise, and have a deeper understanding of the pertinent issues than "uninitiated" others.
of course, no medical delivery system has worked very well in developing countries.
their ethnodiagnosis of the condition is nevertheless 100% accurate.
such research is not only costly, but reductionistic because traditional prescriptions are often intended to produce simultaneous or synergistic actions such as site-specific attack on the disease, enhanced immune response, increased cellular uptake, and repression of side effects.
perhaps dr. mccorkle can tell us which "traditional medical systems" even conceptualized an immune system or the cellular nature of living tissue before these entities were discovered and articulated by "western" science.
unfortunately, since no author or source is cited for this anecdote, we'll probably never know the answers to these questions.
cultural constructivists seem to prefer broad philosophical, magical and metaphysical understandings of the universe which are not based on objective and systematic examination of constituent parts and underlying physical laws.
starting in the 1950s and 60s, more than a few "social scientists" developed severe cases of what has been termed "physics envy," (though the malaise certainly involves similar resentment toward mathematics, chemistry, physiology, genetics, biology and virtually all other bona fide sciences).
rather than taking third world agriculturalists "back to the future," ethnoveterinary medicine seems more likely to keep them stuck in the past.
i'm sure that ethnoscience advocates would be aghast at the western ethnocentric notion that the time time-tested ethnoscientific techniques of female infanticide and female subordination and ethnoscientific knowledge regarding disease vulnerability of female children should be thrown out in favor of contraception, increased access to western medicine, and western notions of sexual egalitarianism.
it's understanding why the condition exists and knowing what to do about it that really counts.
i would be the first to concede that these are examples of non-scientist, informal observers providing science and scientists with invaluable information, but that is not what dr. mccorkle and her colleagues are claiming.
