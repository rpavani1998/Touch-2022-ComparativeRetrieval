the fda said that neotame is a white crystalline powder that dissolves in water and can be used as a mealtime sweetener or added to recipes.
but mr. rosa said he doesn't see neotame, a white crystalline powder, taking the place of aspartame in the sweetener market.
for example, these species metabolize phenylalamine 4-5 times faster than humans.
the main market is soft drinks, dairy products including yogurt and frozen dairy desserts, and chewing gum.
moreover, phenylalamine concentrates much more on the fetal side of the placenta, and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier to affect the fetus brain.
from its evaluation of the neotame database, the fda was able to conclude that neotame is safe for human consumption.
these reviews have not uncovered any material submitted by the petitioner that addresses the body-weight gain issue.
nutrasweet president and chief executive nick e. rosa said the company plans "to push really hard, really fast" in marketing neotame after the fda formally publishes its approval tuesday.
because of neotame's strength -- it usually would take 8,000 teaspoons of sugar to equal the sweetening power of one teaspoon of neotame in most products -- mr. rosa said the "economic benefit is extraordinary" for makers of soft drinks and other products that use sugar substitutes.
the new sweetener, he said, can be blended with regular sweeteners such as corn syrup as well as with other sugar substitutes.
the safety studies were designed to identify possible toxic effects, such as cancer-causing, reproductive, and neurological effects.
ii animal testing it isa gross error to project the animal studies onto humans where the massive consumption of this chemical is envisioned.
alan rulis, director of the fda's office of food-additive safety, said the fda found that there were no "risks or concerns" associated with neotame, and that it met the safety standards applied to all food additives.
the body weight gain issue impacts the establishment of a no effect or no adverse effect level and must, therefore, be evaluated closely.
we prefer that it be a pc-formatted diskette with the manuscript in word 6.0/95 or 97 format.
the sweetener, neotame, is made by nutrasweet co., which also produces aspartame, a widely used sugar substitute that is 200 times sweeter than sugar.
nutrasweet must submit a special request for neotame to be considered for use on meat and poultry because those two foods fall under the jurisdiction of the department of agriculture.
the agency said it concluded from the studies that neotame was safe for human consumption.
as a board-certified internatl and endocrinologist, i have repeatedly found that aspartame products aggravate both diabetes control and its complications--and have written on this subject.
it is a free-flowing, water soluble, white crystalline powder that is heat stable and can be used as a tabletop sweetener as well as in cooking applications.
from my work on pesticides, there are several molecules in each cell even in parts pertrillion.
mr. rosa said soft-drink companies will be able to get the same taste by using less sweetener and more water, cutting down on production costs.
dr. rulis said nutrasweet didn't request such consideration.
the safety studies were designed to identify possible toxic effects, such as cancer-causing, reproductive, and neurological effects.
contrary to the monsanto submission, i have considerable data that point toaspartame being toxic, mutagenic, carcinogenic, diabetogenic and teratogenic.
dr. rulis said nutrasweet didn't request such consideration.

please also do not forget to add the reference number (99-83) to the label of the diskette.
but mr. rosa said he doesn't see neotame, a white crystalline powder, taking the place of aspartame in the sweetener market.
but after reviewing a large number of studies, the fda concluded it was safe and that further study wasn't needed.
nutrasweet co. makes neotame, as well as nutrasweet.

let me repeat:it will be a public health tragedy if the aspartame problem is allowed to be repeated in the absence of these safeguards!

mr. rosa said aspartame is "absolutely safe" and that allegations made against it have never been proved.
in particular, the comments questioned the adequacy of the data in resolving issues regarding the body weight gain of test animals consuming neotame, and their reported food consumption values.
as such there has to be a confidentiality until publication.
concluding comments i am a totally corporate-neutral physician who is concerned about the ongoing exposure of the population to aspartame and numerous other chemicals that were approved without adequate long-term pertinent studies by corporate-neutral investigative and politically-neutral regulators.

neotame identifying information i am enclosing a scientific paper accepted for publication by the western journal of medicine.
depending on its food application, neotame is approximately 7,000 to 13,000 times sweeter than sugar.
