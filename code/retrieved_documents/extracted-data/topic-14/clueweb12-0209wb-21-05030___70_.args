because they provide relatively safe and effective approaches for treating many conditions, evidence-based, complementary, alternative medicine (cam) health care modalities should be integrated into the u.s. health care system.these systems, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, naturopathy, chiropractic, homeopathy and traditional chinese and ayurvedic medicine offer aspects of health care that are not provided by conventional western medicine.apart from the fact that this would undoubtedly cause a large legally disenfranchised body of people to seek natural remedies through illegal venues, it also would overturn a 500 year-old commonwealth law that prohibits governmental legal restriction enabling anyone to treat patients with herbs.preserving the tradition of herbal medicine here are three good reasons why herbal medicine should remain as unregulated as possible: because of the above stated reasons, both china and india, which have long standing traditions of herbal medicine, are able to recognize professional herbalists without prohibiting the accessibility to herbs and herbal preparations and the popular practice of herbal medicine by all.with the popularity of these traditional healing systems, we are at the place in time where at least a third of the people of america have recognized the value of these traditional systems not only for developing countries but as being of great benefit for certain conditions in our own country.a recent study based on 1162 patients found acupuncture to be more effective for treating lower back pain, from which 85% of all people will suffer at some point in their life, than conventional treatments.[ii] this is only one of many conditions that are better treated with traditional alternative medicine but the fact remains that these time honored methods represent relatively non-invasive treatments that continues to be the legacy of all traditional peoples throughout the world.in light of this, it seems reasonable that one would prefer to “think him/herself better” with herbs, acupuncture, homeopathy, tcm or ayurveda that has a long, sound record of safety and efficacy unmatched by invasive medical procedures and drugs that are extremely expensive with a high probability of adverse reactions.further, when combined with all other iatrogenic causes (caused by drugs and medical treatment) of injuries and deaths, the total rises to 16.4 million people who are affected with costs modestly estimated to be well over $300 billion a year.education, not regulation many will still argue that the unrestricted use of herbs and self treatment is dangerous, but the fact remains thatstatistics of adverse events and deaths from herbal treatments are infinitesimal compared to the estimated 400,000 people who die annually from pharmaceuticals alone, or who are otherwise injured or made sick from conventional medicine and drugs.shockingly, these 'iatrogenic' (medically induced) deaths account for the fifth major cause of mortality in the u.s. i am one of the millions of americans who have found complementary, natural health methods to be an invaluable part of my health care requirements and needs.for example, compared to the g8, the u.s. has the highest infant mortality, the most mothers who die during childbirth, the most lives lost that could have been saved, and the worst in treatment of cancer.for example, statin drugs taken to lower cholesterol cause a high number of people to develop symptoms of rhabdomyalgia, chronic acute muscle pain caused by a breakdown of muscle fibers.further, everyone should realize that under a universal health care program, you still have the option to pay for whatever services may not be provided.as part of a counterculture seeking independence from the mainstream in all ways possible, i looked to herbal medicine first as a passionate attraction to nature and plants, and secondly for the possibilities of what it might offer as an alternative to more invasive and western medical drugs and procedures.failure to address the underlying cause of disease results in the widespread use and abuse of stronger synthetic alternatives.
