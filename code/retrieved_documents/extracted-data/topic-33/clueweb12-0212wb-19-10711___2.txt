the components built in asp  are really limited, so if you need to use "advanced" features like  interacting with ftp servers, you need to buy additional components.
the biggest drawback of asp is that it's a proprietary system that is natively used only on microsoft internet information server (iis).
yes, the server-side asp2php is the one most often referred to as well asthis client-side option.
cold fusion has better error  handling, database abstraction and date parsing although database abstraction  is addressed in php 4.

asp is not really a language in itself, it's an acronym for active  server pages, the actual language used to program asp with is visual basic  script or jscript.
there are a couple  of projects in the works that allows asp to run in other environments and  webservers:instantasp from halcyon (commercial), chili!soft asp from chili!soft  (commercial).
perl is a very tried and true  language, it's been around since the late eighties, but php is maturing very  quickly.
the flexibility / complexity of perl  makes it easier to write code that another author / coder has a hard time
the flexibility / complexity of perl makes it easier to write code that another author / coder has a hard time reading.
asp support is also enabled by default in the iis server making it easy to get up and running.
the biggest advantage of php over perl is that php was designed  for scripting for the web where perl was designed to do a lot more and can  because of this get very complicated.
some of the pros of asp is that since it primarily uses vbscript it's relatively easy to pick up the language if you're already know how to program in visual basic.

php has  pretty much all the 'good' functionality of perl: constructs, syntax and so on,  without making it as complicated as perl can be.
asp is said to be a slower and more cumbersome language than php, less stable as well.
cold fusion has a good ide and is generally easier to get started with, whereas php initially requires more programming knowledge.
