php is commonly said to be faster and more efficient for complex programming tasks and trying out new ideas.asp is said to be a slower and more cumbersome language than php, less stable as well.php is generally referred to as more stable and less resource intensive as well.the flexibility / complexity of perl makes it easier to write code that another author / coder has a hard time reading.php has a less confusing and stricter format without losing flexibility.the biggest advantage of php over perl is that php was designed for scripting for the web where perl was designed to do a lot more and can because of this get very complicated.some of the pros of asp is that since it primarily uses vbscript it's relatively easy to pick up the language if you're already know how to program in visual basic.php has pretty much all the 'good' functionality of perl: constructs, syntax and so on, without making it as complicated as perl can be.another thing that is listed as one of cold fusion's strengths is its excellent search engine, but it has been mentioned that a search engine is not something that should be included in a web scripting language.perl is a very tried and true language, it's been around since the late eighties, but php is maturing very quickly.the components built in asp are really limited, so if you need to use "advanced" features like interacting with ftp servers, you need to buy additional components.cold fusion has a good ide and is generally easier to get started with, whereas php initially requires more programming knowledge.cold fusion has better error handling, database abstraction and date parsing although database abstraction is addressed in php 4.the biggest drawback of asp is that it's a proprietary system that is natively used only on microsoft internet information server (iis).php is easier to integrate into existing html than perl.
