there are a couple of projects in the works that allows asp to function with other environments and webservers:» instantasp from » halcyon (commercial), chili!soft asp from » chili!soft (commercial), and » mono (open-source).
further, php runs on nearly every modern platform in existence, while cold fusion is only available on windows, solaris, linux, macos, and aix.
while coldfusion once had better error handling, database abstraction, and date parsing, the database abstraction shortfalls were addressed in php 4.
php is also easier to integrate into existing html than perl.
yet php's command-line interpreter (cli) is powerful enough to perform high-level tasks much in the same way perl has been traditionally employed.
the biggest drawback of asp is that it's a proprietary system that is natively used only on the microsoft internet information server (iis) platform.
because of  this, perl can get very complicated.

php is the best language for web programming, but what about other  languages?
asp is not really a language in itself, but an acronym for active server pages; the actual languages used to program asp include visual basic script, jscript, and c#, among others.
one of the pro's of asp is  that, since it primarily uses vbscript, it's relatively easy to pick up the  language if you're already proficient in visual basic.
alternatively, you can use the ***rssit*** tag.
a particular quality that is  listed as one of coldfusion's strengths is its excellent search engine, but  many strong arguments suggest that a search engine is not something that should  be included in a web scripting language.

cold fusion has a good ide and is generally quicker for new programmers to achieve results for very simple applications, whereas php initially requires more programming knowledge.
php is the best language for web programming, but what about other languages?
the flexibility / complexity of perl can  make it difficult for developers of varying skill levels to collaborate.
php is commonly said to be faster and more efficient for complex programming tasks and trying out new ideas, and is considered by many to be more stable and less resource-intensive as well.
the biggest advantage of php over perl is that php was designed for  scripting for the web, while perl was designed to do a lot more.
however, the  components built in asp are really limited, so if you need to use  "advanced" features (like interacting with ftp servers), you'll need  to buy additional components.
this limits its availability to win32 based servers.
further, php runs on nearly every  modern platform in existence, while cold fusion is only available on windows,  solaris, linux, macos, and aix.
php has a less-confusing and stricter format without losing flexibility.
in large part, php has all the 'good' functionality of perl - constructs, syntax, et cetera - without making it as complicated as perl can be.
cold fusion has a good ide and is generally  quicker for new programmers to achieve results for very simple applications,  whereas php initially requires more programming knowledge.
perl is a very tried and true language, and  has stood its ground since the 1980's, but php has matured and evolved quickly,  and continues to make fantastic progress.
cold fusion is  designed with non-programmers in mind, while php is focused on programmers.
