i’m a classic asp developer for some years now and i’ve tried the .net platform and what you guys say it’s true: too much complicated.
you could do that.. or you could give rails a whirl..
i am a self taught asp programmer at a large corporation and everyone loves my work… and it does what it needs to do!
of course…this is ms w’re talking about here….. [/rant] ok…i feel better now :-)
back to the hand work it is and there .net is the most irritating thing to use.
i enjoy programming…not clicking checkboxes and dragging objects around.
my client getting really impatient, i had to get down to business and tried to fix the mess.
you do know that with server 2008 iis is no longer configured standard to run asp code right?
so nice to know i’m not the only one refusing to jump to .net.
refusal to move to asp.net is a career death wish if you want to stay with the microsoft platform.
“asp.net is too overbloated for websites” i thought i was the only one who thought this way!
it’s interesting to try something else
ajaxium sites are said to "remain accessible  to all search engines and old browsers... hotskills: asp.net ajax for developers asp.net ajax skills, training  and salary information details for... asp.net ajax special report our asp.net ajax special report offers  book excerpts, a learning guide and several articles to help .net
please contact us at .
and after working for years in asp.net this is not fun at all.
classic asp is still going – “i keep checking and they just keep piling on more layers of the stuff” – exactly :)
i’ve tried using .net and ran thru some tutorials, etc.
we would love to hear about any news that we could put up here.
we’re cutting our own throats here by signing up for each new product that ms develops!
i see these new platforms as just another way for ms to hold developers and companies hostage.
jsrs still uses hidden iframes for compatibility with older browsers – there are many great libraries that have exceeded it in current functionality, so i haven’t made the effort to release an xmlhttp version.
i use classic asp at work…i’m actually the only one there using it while everyone is working in c# .net
yeah sure you can drag and drop stuff and build stuff the easy way the way .net wants it.
the only thing i can’t get to work is cdonts (no particular reason for using cdonts, but hey it ran ok for 8 years).
after 6 hours of looking at useless (mostly automatically generated) code, i bit the bullet and re-wrote the app from scratch in classic asp in about 3 weeks.
i am using classical asp for some time now, but i am thinking of moving to .net !
classic asp is so much slower to code for.
hehehe… microsoft still uses asp on 50% of their sites… check some of the msdn (?!) pages… 3 months ago, i renewed my msdn subscription, on a complete asp driven platform… hmm..
me too, why not it’s worth noting that ajax for classic asp has been around for some time in the more sophisticated form of clasp – the classic asp framework (seehttp://www.claspdev.com).
i really thought i may have been the only one that will not touch .net .
plus there’s a decent amount of dev work out there for it.
[rant] frankly, i’m a bit tired of spending years gaining experience on a platform only to have it ripped out from under me and being forced to use yet another new product that costs big bucks and is supposedly so much better.
to me that’s not programming.

and they find their jobs vanishing.
yes, asp still out there.
with just a notepad it’s very handy and you can update it any pc.
i’m just commenting about the “valid xhtml and css” thing at the bottom of this page.
good to hear there are some others like me out there ;) i have started to move over to .net.
and i never make bugs in my code!
i recently purchased a book that specifically discusses how to think in object oriented ways.
in this type of environment (a lot of changes pretty often) it would be nasty to re-compile the entire app in order to work… ¿or am i missing some asp.net feature that avoid this?… anyway… my vote it’s for classic asp weâ€™re cutting our own throats here by signing up for each new product that ms develops!
bottom line for me was that .net was way too complicated and bloated.
i work at an ad agency doing small sites and classic asp is perfect.
make project then solution (day is over)
and they find their jobs vanishing goode coding techniques great info its great
i hired a .net programmer for a fairly simple project that should have taken about 2 months.

i agree on the bloated .net stuff but think it’s much faster for enterprise development.
protected, public etc.
and with each “new and better” product that’s released, i end up having no more experience than the average 20 year old.
for the work i do, it gets the job done and so far it has never failed me.
lol ian, the canadian government still uses classic asp, so if i get the job i applied for my career will have gone from asp developer to .net
hehe, i thought i was alone in asp!
but what if you need to use a excisting database (like oracle) and use rulesengines in between.
make classes and redit some classes (day is over)
as long as classic asp is supported and my hosting company will host classic asp pages, that’s what i will use.
i’m a classic asp programmer and i really enjoy using it.
caching and dynamic views my client does not want to change his cache settings on ie and i'm trying to figure out a way to dynamically update a view each time it is visited.
technologies really is the future for enterprise solutions but you’re right…for simple things, php and classic asp are simply better solutions.
i’ve been developing code for about 30 years now (basic, fortran, pascal, ada, c, c++, dos, windows, visual c, visual basic, visual studio, mfc, win32, com, asp, etc.)
at any rate, i don’t see asp going away anytime soon since there’s about 100 million websites using the stuff and ms would be nuts to stop supporting it.
developers  get started with microsoft's ajax...
just change couple things around & voila!
i have felt like a big loser because i haven’t forced myself to learn .net….after all it took my non programming mind a long time just to get to where i am now with asp….as long as the client is happy who cares what you use.
go tuesday, july 3rd, 2007 category: .net, javascript, libraryp >are you writing classic asp pages and want to join in the ajax revolution too?
i keep checking and they just keep piling on more layers of the stuff….
view the asp.net ajax tutorial top definitions in episode 25, we chat about ie 8, standards, acid3, server side javascript, and more.
i’ve realised latetly i think it might be precisely because microsoft stopped adding features to asp that everything still works!
people do have a point about .net being too much for websites; unless you’re doing enterprise level financial web applications then there’s no need for it i have used .net.
a quote of mine: “give me a request & a response object, let me shake the internet!”
asp.net is too overbloated for websites, i mean, who really wants to re-compile thier website, everytime the make a little bug….
but only for large corporations where the benefit of corporate-wide standards and re-usable components outweight the complexity.
it applies too to the ajax.
nothing wrong with asp, really.
so big corps can have talented designers coming up with the real stuff and code-monkeys pointing and clicking all day, re-using the components.
we have individual blogs too: powered by wordpress.
i just wrote a cute little cms in classic asp over the weekend…since i’m not a .net developer i can’t comment on how long it would have taken… i am looking forward to getting into .net though…i’ll be migrating over soon you guys are crazy.
yay for classic asp! :)
and whats with all those different classes?
i do both in my current work environment and we get so much more done much more quickly under asp.net than we do classic asp.
well for the next 3 months i’m stuck maintaining a classic asp site (yuck, patooey!!)
i am going to migrate over sometime this year but oop is an entirely different way of thinking.
i... how to change html form tags to ajax how to change html form tags to... ie 8 crashing problem
it’s not like we have to worry about future patches screwing up old applications: there won’t be any patches.
very interesting stuff.
not exactly late to join in the ajax revolution, jsrs was originally written for asp when released in 2000, and (still) works with either vbscript or jscript on the server side.
the framework is simialr to xajax for php, in that it allows you to tie in to a named function on th eserver side.
its definately worth a try.
podcast: asp.net ajax gurus explain the framework inside and out two  authors of "asp.net ajax in action" share their insight into getting  started with microsoft's ajax development...
check out this new asp cms http://www.dmxready.com/dmxreadyv2/index.asp?page=catalog&product=cms i could not agree more about what is being said about asp.
just in case you need a quick leg-up on js-based ajax, you can pick up a free library on our web site:
who are the ajaxians?
interesting you say .net is quicker
i use a lot of ajax meant for php with classic asp.
6 months later, the guy (supposedly quite good) was still pointing and clicking and delivering nothing.
me too respect for all you guys who still use classic asp….. probably you have to consider converting to dotnet :)
the writing is on the wall… bs, classic asp will be supported in ws 2008, just have to install it… blogs.iis.net/metegokt/archive/2007/06/26/administering-iis7-on-server-core-installations-of-windows-server-2008.aspx using classic asp since it’s inception.
yeah no need to compile the code again and again.
and tried for days to do something i can do in asp classic in 5 minutes.
well, ajaxed is for you.
it looks like this:plain text posted by dion almaer at 4:40 am 41 comments comments feed trackback uri just who the hell is having to use classic asp still?
i suppose younger readers will learn this soon enough when in a few years all their .net experience counts for nothing
you'll get the latest news, technical resources, announcements and more.
it helped me a lot and saved a lot of nerves best move to .net?
but the big reason to stay in asp, the real one is the fact that you can integrate new code and edit existing one easily.
i have found that understanding how to build and write powerful sql along with asp gives me everything i need.
i’m in vacation can i redit my website (no i dont think so, no cyber have .net
but it pays the bills so i’m glad i found this site.
i have been refusing to do .net too.

yet another steep learning curve!
but i can’t really see how .net can be quicker to develop under unless you don’t need to customise any aspects of your ui.
hello everyone, here\'s the situation: two iseries boxes - dev and prod both v5r4m0 we\'re using ajax to dynamically load content using a tabbed...
that and asp.net runs better on the server and play nice with your database request bandwidth.
anything slightly different seems to require a whole different approach.
i can’t image what maintenance and upgrade nightmares i would have had if i had chosen to use the then flavour of the month .net 1.0 – man that was real pile of shite.
vote for classic asp i am so relieved to see this site and people who still have positive things to say about classic asp.
i’m using c# instead of vb as i think there is a bit more help and support out there for c#.
.net full of problems as a web develop tool, not like php or jsp.
the remote procedure call pattern was the model in common use before ajax was named.

dlls is away slower than any javascript functions ofcourse !!
more new tools for asp.net ajax new drag-and-drop tools for asp.net  ajax applications were released this week by componentone llc, a tool vendor  for the microsoft environment....
excellent idea web dev bros!
actually we’re in indowebservices just moving to asp.net, but personally i love classic asp most of all, more lightweight
which was written by idiots.

i mean, in my job there’s a lot of maintaining job to the aplicattions, so, it’s pretty cool to open the .asp file, fix the bug, and voilá!…
i’ve got several sites and large systems still working great and still easy to modify that are 7 years old or so.
