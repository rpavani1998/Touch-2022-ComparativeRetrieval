it takes great care and experienced and highly competent developers to create very clean and highly maintainable code.unlike php and other server side scripting technologies, asp.net are source compiled, which means that they are very efficient for creating cpu demanding web applications.this has meant that a lot of "non developers" or people who have no formal training as professionally programmers get into "web development".classic asp is outdated and could be thought of as microsoftâ€™s first attempt at web server side technology.in terms of php from a development perspective it has a "double edged" sword effect: in one sense it is incredibly easy to do common things (90% of most web application functions, eg send email, connect to database, parse data etc).it is not open source, and microsoft has an aggressive development cycle, constantly updating and changing the technologies.the results have been a disastrous, the industry has been effected in a negative way, of course one can not put 100% blame on php alone it is far more complex than that.i like the idea of open-source and free and also get a sense that php/mysql will be easier to digest and get familiar with.this means one can share code across different domains(example, desktop application classes could be used in web application projects and vice versa).however this "ease" of use comes at a major cost, the language is a total failure.in my view this would be a more advantageous option, because both technologies have a lot to offer.asp.net provides a whole host of advanced features such as custom controls, global .asax handlers, generic handles, master pages, and many other features to build enterprise level systems.i'm an experienced windows user so asp with sql is going to be right up my alley, but i see php and mysql all over the place and i've read good things about them.of course php can be used with any sql solution, and could be used with microsoft sql server.in terms of tooling, it is really mature and feature complete.
