both asp and php are languages used to build dynamic web sites that can interact with databases and exchange information.c/c++ is still considered the best programming language by many programmers and people who love this language would surely feel more comfortable with the syntax of php.php has inbuilt features like ftp, email from a web page or even encryption mechanisms but in asp such features are not built in and some additional components are required.additional costs many of the tools used in php are free of cost and since php is open source a lot of code can be found in open source forums.so, it depends on a person-to-person which language he or she is comfortable database connectivity php, being extremely flexible, can connect to various databases, the most popular being mysql.if a user is looking for some e-commerce application development then many would call asp the ideal choice.if we talk about developing a discussion board then asp is equally capable but many feel the best discussion boards are developed in php.asp is built on com based architecture, which is an overhead for the server whereas php code runs in its own memory space.database connectivity php, being extremely flexible, can connect to various databases, the most popular being mysql.this does not mean that php cannot provide e-commerce solutions, only that many people choose asp.platform compatibility php programs can run on various platforms like linux, unix, windows and solaris whereas asp is mainly associated with windows platforms.logged posts: 71 re: asp and php « reply #1 on: september 09, 2010, 09:35:25 pm » both asp and php are languages used to build dynamic web sites that can interact with databases and exchange information.base language php is based on c++ language and the syntax used in php is quite similar to c/c++.if we compare the speed of asp and php then php has an upper hand.asp on the other hand has a more visual basic kind of syntax that again is closely related to only microsoft products.
