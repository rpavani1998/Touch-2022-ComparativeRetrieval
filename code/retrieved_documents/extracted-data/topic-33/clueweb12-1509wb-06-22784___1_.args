as with asp, php can be embedded in html and can dynamically generate web pages in response to client requests.we can help you ensure the quality, performance, and reliability of your internet-based solutions.when using asp, asp.net, php or other languages, the sql query syntax is used as an input parameter to a request to extract information from the database.server-side scripting can be done with any of the .net languages, such as vb.net or c-sharp, and support for code behind files allows for clean separation between html markup and executable code.testing dynamically generated data-driven web pages adds an additional layer of complexity, requiring closed looped testing where client-side requests are triggered against a known data set, with a clear expectation of the resultant web page.these languages can be used within the context of an application framework to provide asp.net-like capabilities.the latest version of asp.net also includes integrated support forajax, simplifying the task of developing rich internet applications.the server-side controls include things such as tables, menus, and other user interface objects that simplify the creation of web pages.in a typical usage scenario, the client requests product information from the asp page on the server, and the asp page fetches the product information from the database and programmatically generates html code to present the retrieved product information in the client browser.asp.net also introduces the notion of server-side controls and transparent maintenance of property states for these controls across multiple page refreshes.an asp web page consists of static elements, such ashtml tags, css, and javascript, as well as vbscript code.the vbscript code interacts with the asp objects to dynamically generate html, css, and javascript, which are returned to the client along with the static content.explore qualitylogicâ€™s website testing solutions by clicking on the links under "testing solutions" to the right, orcontact us for more information or torequest a quote.
