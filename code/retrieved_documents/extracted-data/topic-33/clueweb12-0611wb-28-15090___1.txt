a user can go through tag editor files and try to fix this throughout or can enter all tags by hand, but that has problems (especially when you work in both html-only and asp/php pages.
if so, i can propose adding that to the settings instead of having it on the tag editors only.
having an option for "quote all attributes" (or not!) in the  settings is currently being discussed, but there are a lot of issues involved  to implement this consistently across all tools and still prevent illegal code  being generated...
parsers and custom dialogs would  probably be most helpful.

looks like this is fixed for some cases in hsv5.
some users are reporting code cases where it is still broken though.
as you know, many of these issues can be resolved through homesite  extensions such as vtml.
perhaps it could be extended to help with asp db use in homesite.
parser support for various asp.net languages is one of the most requested asp.net enhancements.
first of all, if you can identify a short list of features that would be the highest priority fixes for h.s 5.0.

the new feature is going to take some time to develop (5.0 timeframe), but once completed, it should not be difficult to apply it to asp.
many developers prefer to use single quotes as so: response.write "this is a string" rather than  extra escaped double quotes response.write "this is a  string" which are easy to miscount.
