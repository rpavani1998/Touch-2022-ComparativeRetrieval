a user can go through tag editor files and try to fix this throughout or can enter all tags by hand, but that has problems (especially when you work in both html-only and asp/php pages.it supports at least the following:      asp validation probably not easy, but it would probably be a killer feature for asp coders.this is not critical for users who have already figured these things out, but it would be useful to help new hs users.it supports at least the following:     "validation of some code, even if we're just talking conditional statements and loops, it would help."we are most interested in those features that contribute greatly to developer productivity in asp, but also other parts of web development."asp, php & asp.net documentation support the documentation that comes installed with homesite should have some information about using hs with asp, php and asp.net, including the fact that you need to set up a server to process the pages and that you should use server mapping.theability to access objects and their properties could be developed for any language that supports the creation of objects.the ability tomanage a sql server without being at the server is a godsend especially since there is no real interface like access is/has.parsers and custom dialogs would probably be most helpful.it could link to asp4hs or php4hs if desired to connect them to the available resources.your guidance on these issues would be most helpful.if the editor replaces single quotes or escaped double quotes with a single set of double quotes on attributes, it may break the code.this basically reproduces some of the functionality of theeditlinkedfile script in letting you easily click and open a linked include file (only file includes, not virtual).a single point option to use single quotes would be a big help.this is similar to the html tag insight, but covers functions and objects in asp.
