in particular, if someone knows one of the technologies featured (php, asp, mysql, access, sql) and wants to know how this one technology relates to others, this is a good source.the php code supplied in the accompanying cd-rom utilizes global variables (which may be turned off in some production environments for security purposes)--but that underscores the use of the text as a textbook, and not a coding "cookbook" with samples that are "ready-to-eat."i found that students should adapt and improve the code from the cd-rom as part of their studies, so that they could fix some typos, and learn how code integration works.it is an excellent book for anyone new to web applications or someone with some experience, who wants to know more.to start a book with the basics of html and then take a user through to complex database design would require more explanation and peripheral information.i use this book for intermediate web developer students who have a solid grounding in html, css and javascript, and some basic knowledge of either php or asp (or other programming logic).my goal is to be a free lance web designer and to own a web design company using mysql (open source database), php (open source scripting language), access database, and active server pages (asp).students have created portfolio pieces using the concepts in this text like psychological profile tests, e-commerce sites, calendar applications and marketing surveys.so far your book is the best and most helpful, in showing how to connect to a server and for sure will save me and my clients alot.the examples of the book are well-chosen, without any extraneous material, and are explained in a table, with code in one column and explanation in another.i find that larry ullman's books provide far better explanations of the coding and help the user to understand how the coding fits in with a) the rest of the coding on the page and b) the coding that relates to subsequent pages.consequently, from learning and experience, i read about mysql and php and studied it as well.i wanted to learn sql knowing how powerful it is, but how expensive commerialize dbms softwares were it made me stick with access.also, the asp uses the less-common, but more palatable asp javascript (or jscript) instead of the more commonly utilized asp vbscript (but even third-party asp interpreters like that used in the sunone server handled the code).i wanted to learn sql knowing how powerful it is, but because how expensive commerialize dbms softwares were it made me stick with access.
