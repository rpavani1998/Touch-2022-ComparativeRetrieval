keep in mind that most web hosting companies do not allowed asp server pages, only php.
asp.net is superior to php because php is a horrible language, but you can use good languages with asp.net, and there are mono implementations, and if they're good then windows licenses are not a problem.
keep in mind that most web hosting companies do not  allowed asp server pages, only php.
asp.net is usually written in c# or vb.net, and if  you learn a language like c# then you will able to write many other things  besides websites, like windows apps, iphone apps, android apps, windows phone  apps, and not to mention linux/mac os x apps.

i would say asp.net is a much better  thing to learn especially if you want to be able to have skills that translate  outside of web development.
