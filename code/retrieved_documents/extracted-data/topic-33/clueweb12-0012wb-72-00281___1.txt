it wouldn't be the first time i've sub-contracted work nor will it be the last.
oct 2005 03:49 pm daz moderator p: 936 no worries any takers?
recently i have been designing sites for a web design company in england.
but it's been  a long time since i've done any such work
the project is creating a secure login system where users can reorder items.
and i don't have the time to do it.
thats the risk i take and can  easily tie in as part of the arrangement with the sub contractor.
sitemorse have received a bit of a slating for it on these forums....
they pay me a fixed price and likely charge the customer 2  or 3 times what they give me.
(send me the text and i'll post if necessary).
but it's been a long time since i've done any such work

if you like jack the way i treat it is that the person doing the work is a temporary employee for my freelance business.
isn't it a bit unethical to pass someone else's work of as your own, particularly if there's cash involved?

although still a novice i would normally have asked for more information to see if i thought i could handle it, but i've just been given a rather large project to do (client was informed it would take 3 months...)
