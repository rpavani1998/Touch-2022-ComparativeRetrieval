the project is creating a secure login system where users can reorder items.they pay me a fixed price and likely charge the customer 2 or 3 times what they give me.thats the risk i take and can easily tie in as part of the arrangement with the sub contractor.what's important to them and me is that the work is up to the standards expected.no registered users are online.i just need a quote and then will add my small fee on top for being the go between.not to mention what happens if 9 months down the line, the site collapses and they come running to you.off the webweb technologycommercial events & services you cannot post new topics in this forum you cannot reply to topics in this forum you cannot edit your posts in this forum you cannot delete your posts in this forum you cannot vote in polls in this forum partner sites based on phpbb || hosting, concept and maintenance bymis web design || contact admin - accessify.com, - rnib web access centre.quote: not to mention what happens if 9 months down the line, the site collapses and they come running to you.it wouldn't be the first time i've sub-contracted work nor will it be the last.l: gateshead, uk not to mention what happens if 9 months down the line, the site collapses and they come running to you.if anyone fancies taking this on for a bit of extra cash, isn't hard to pay and doesn't mind going under my name (as i intend to take commission ) please pm me.your (presumably) previously good name will be away round the u-bend before you blink.if you like jack the way i treat it is that the person doing the work is a temporary employee for my freelance business.that's fine by me and i don't see any problem with it.
