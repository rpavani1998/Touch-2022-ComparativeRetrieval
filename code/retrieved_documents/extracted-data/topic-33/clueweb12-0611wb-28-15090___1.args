theability to access objects and their properties could be developed for any language that supports the creation of objects.
some users are reporting code cases where it is still broken though.
we could use more details of what functionality would be useful though.

it could link to asp4hs or php4hs if desired to connect them to the available resources.
this basically reproduces some of the functionality of theeditlinkedfile script in letting you easily click and open a linked include file (only file includes, not virtual).
this is similar to the html tag insight, but covers functions and objects in asp.

a user can go through tag editor files and try to fix this throughout or can enter all tags by hand, but that has problems (especially when you work in both html-only and asp/php pages.
parsers and custom dialogs would probably be most helpful.

first of all, if you can identify a short list of features that would be the highest priority fixes for h.s 5.0.
might look for third party validators that could be interfaced to hs.

you could do an extended s&r to turn it on by default for all of them (just add a checked attribute to the checkbox).

~jw 11/26/01 improved asp color coding this was frequently requested, but seems to have been addressed pretty satisfactorily in hs 4.5.1 and later.
i've found that some browsers have (sometimes?) trouble with single quotes though, but i cannot remember exact details.

tag editors have this as an option (off by default).

-- jw script debugging this might be possible with good integration with the ms script debugger.
if asp validation is going to be included, homesite will need to recognise includes properly.

the ability tomanage a sql server without being at the server is a godsend especially since there is no real interface like access is/has.
this is not critical for users who have already figured these things out, but it would be useful to help new hs users.
