not to mention it also being an ideal technology for many other areas such as desktop, server, mobile etc… comparing php against .net is like comparing a microwave to a cooker.
i prefer asp.net though, drastically better for my needs.
i laughed when it was stated php’s speed is “strong” and asp.net’s speed is “weak”.

they can achieve similar results but they can’t do everything the other can.
while we do work primarily with php, for the obvious advantages, we do work withasp from time to time, as some of our clients have older websites which were built on that platform.

but when it comes to speed, asp.net wins hands down.
based on experience i love both php and asp.net.
one of the biggest costs with any project is development time, and you can get through a huge amount more work with .net technologies.
php is also faster than asp.

the most noteworthy differences include: there is a very large difference between php and asp in terms of price.
very good article thank you.
the cool thing is everyone sees through that so well now.
php 4 php 5 asp.netphp 4 php 5 asp.net when it comes down to it, php is the overall winner in terms of price, speed, platform compatibility, and the size and responsiveness of its developer community.
on the other hand,asp requires both initial and ongoing costs for maintenance and debugging.

furthermore, any additionalasp libraries will also come with a price tag.

there is noway a interpreted language can beat a compiled one not bad.
express is free, which is great for students and newcommers (or anyone really), and the debugging tools, intellitype, and many other features make this ide really stand out.
unlike asp, php has a fairly large developer community that is active in reporting bugs and creating additionalphp libraries.
asp and asp.net work totally different, and a compiled asp.net page is very fast.
additionally, php developers have contributed to a variety of open source projects.
when it comes down to it, php is the overall winner in terms of price, speed, platform compatibility, and the size and responsiveness of its developer community.
so if you have an application that performs multiple queries or is frequently accessed, it would be best to use a language that was more efficient.

especially for those one like me who are delving into this filed( php).
also, code reusability with asp.net is exceptional.
