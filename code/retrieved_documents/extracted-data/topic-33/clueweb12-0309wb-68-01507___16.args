back to the hand work it is and there .net is the most irritating thing to use.
i enjoy programming…not clicking checkboxes and dragging objects around.
my client getting really impatient, i had to get down to business and tried to fix the mess.
so nice to know i’m not the only one refusing to jump to .net.
ajaxium sites are said to "remain accessible to all search engines and old browsers... hotskills: asp.net ajax for developers asp.net ajax skills, training and salary information details for... asp.net ajax special report our asp.net ajax special report offers book excerpts, a learning guide and several articles to help .net
and after working for years in asp.net this is not fun at all.
i’ve tried using .net and ran thru some tutorials, etc.
we would love to hear about any news that we could put up here.
i see these new platforms as just another way for ms to hold developers and companies hostage.
jsrs still uses hidden iframes for compatibility with older browsers – there are many great libraries that have exceeded it in current functionality, so i haven’t made the effort to release an xmlhttp version.
yeah sure you can drag and drop stuff and build stuff the easy way the way .net wants it.
the only thing i can’t get to work is cdonts (no particular reason for using cdonts, but hey it ran ok for 8 years).
after 6 hours of looking at useless (mostly automatically generated) code, i bit the bullet and re-wrote the app from scratch in classic asp in about 3 weeks.
classic asp is so much slower to code for.
i really thought i may have been the only one that will not touch .net .
plus there’s a decent amount of dev work out there for it.
[rant] frankly, i’m a bit tired of spending years gaining experience on a platform only to have it ripped out from under me and being forced to use yet another new product that costs big bucks and is supposedly so much better.
with just a notepad it’s very handy and you can update it any pc.
i recently purchased a book that specifically discusses how to think in object oriented ways.
bottom line for me was that .net was way too complicated and bloated.
i work at an ad agency doing small sites and classic asp is perfect.
i agree on the bloated .net stuff but think it’s much faster for enterprise development.
protected, public etc.
and with each “new and better” product that’s released, i end up having no more experience than the average 20 year old.
for the work i do, it gets the job done and so far it has never failed me.
lol ian, the canadian government still uses classic asp, so if i get the job i applied for my career will have gone from asp developer to .net
as long as classic asp is supported and my hosting company will host classic asp pages, that’s what i will use.
i’m a classic asp programmer and i really enjoy using it.
caching and dynamic views my client does not want to change his cache settings on ie and i'm trying to figure out a way to dynamically update a view each time it is visited.
technologies really is the future for enterprise solutions but you’re right…for simple things, php and classic asp are simply better solutions.
at any rate, i don’t see asp going away anytime soon since there’s about 100 million websites using the stuff and ms would be nuts to stop supporting it.
developers get started with microsoft's ajax...
i have felt like a big loser because i haven’t forced myself to learn .net….after all it took my non programming mind a long time just to get to where i am now with asp….as long as the client is happy who cares what you use.
i keep checking and they just keep piling on more layers of the stuff….
view the asp.net ajax tutorial top definitions in episode 25, we chat about ie 8, standards, acid3, server side javascript, and more.
i’ve realised latetly i think it might be precisely because microsoft stopped adding features to asp that everything still works!
people do have a point about .net being too much for websites; unless you’re doing enterprise level financial web applications then there’s no need for it i have used .net.
asp.net is too overbloated for websites, i mean, who really wants to re-compile thier website, everytime the make a little bug….
but only for large corporations where the benefit of corporate-wide standards and re-usable components outweight the complexity.
so big corps can have talented designers coming up with the real stuff and code-monkeys pointing and clicking all day, re-using the components.
we have individual blogs too: powered by wordpress.
i just wrote a cute little cms in classic asp over the weekend…since i’m not a .net developer i can’t comment on how long it would have taken… i am looking forward to getting into .net though…i’ll be migrating over soon you guys are crazy.
i do both in my current work environment and we get so much more done much more quickly under asp.net than we do classic asp.
it’s not like we have to worry about future patches screwing up old applications: there won’t be any patches.
very interesting stuff.
the framework is simialr to xajax for php, in that it allows you to tie in to a named function on th eserver side.
podcast: asp.net ajax gurus explain the framework inside and out two authors of "asp.net ajax in action" share their insight into getting started with microsoft's ajax development...
just in case you need a quick leg-up on js-based ajax, you can pick up a free library on our web site:
i use a lot of ajax meant for php with classic asp.
6 months later, the guy (supposedly quite good) was still pointing and clicking and delivering nothing.
the writing is on the wall… bs, classic asp will be supported in ws 2008, just have to install it… blogs.iis.net/metegokt/archive/2007/06/26/administering-iis7-on-server-core-installations-of-windows-server-2008.aspx using classic asp since it’s inception.
you'll get the latest news, technical resources, announcements and more.
but the big reason to stay in asp, the real one is the fact that you can integrate new code and edit existing one easily.
i have found that understanding how to build and write powerful sql along with asp gives me everything i need.
but it pays the bills so i’m glad i found this site.
we'll activate your free membership with your subscription.
more podcasts receive e-mails on the topics that interest you most.
but i can’t really see how .net can be quicker to develop under unless you don’t need to customise any aspects of your ui.
that and asp.net runs better on the server and play nice with your database request bandwidth.
i can’t image what maintenance and upgrade nightmares i would have had if i had chosen to use the then flavour of the month .net 1.0 – man that was real pile of shite.
vote for classic asp i am so relieved to see this site and people who still have positive things to say about classic asp.
i’m using c# instead of vb as i think there is a bit more help and support out there for c#.
.net full of problems as a web develop tool, not like php or jsp.
actually we’re in indowebservices just moving to asp.net, but personally i love classic asp most of all, more lightweight
i mean, in my job there’s a lot of maintaining job to the aplicattions, so, it’s pretty cool to open the .asp file, fix the bug, and voilá!…
i’ve got several sites and large systems still working great and still easy to modify that are 7 years old or so.
