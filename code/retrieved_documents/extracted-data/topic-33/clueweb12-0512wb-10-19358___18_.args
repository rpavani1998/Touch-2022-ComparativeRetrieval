it’s also about knowing your server, optimizing it properly, and knowing how to exploit the resources you have.you also have access to this code to further enhance your controls and optimize it to your needs.mysql access with linux is faster by more than a little and on windows, mysql access deteriorates in version 5.3 (this seems to be poor implementation, see postgresql below.)obviously other performance gains can only be a good thing, i don’t see why a newcomer would choose php over .net, simply due to the depth of support you guys (ms) give, the size of the community and the nature of c# and asp syntax.they also had a vested interest in getting good response times to prove themselves valuable.as long as someone’s willing to pay me a good buck i’ll write in, or learn, whatever language and/or framework they need me to write in for them.(i mean, real programming languages) i think asp.net is far better platform than php and an asp.net developer is a lot more productive than a php developer.if you are building an application, or running an application that supports it, postgresql might be a better database choice since it performs pretty much the same on windows and linux.anyway, i still love both asp.net & php because both these give me opportunity to work and accomplish great things, even though, i have always preferred asp.net before php."postgresql performance is very close on both platforms (within 6/100 of a second for 1000 operations) – it’s faster on windows and faster still on windows with php 5.3" for sure, postgresql is better with php.both windows and linux implementations of php will benefit from php byte code caching.that is, in php, you design your own controls, your own javascript and your own css to fit your needs for what your website’s intended use.postgresql performance is very close on both platforms (within 6/100 of a second for 1000 operations) – it’s faster on windows and faster still on windows with php 5.3 ms sql server access from php 5.2 on windows is marginally slower than mysql access on linux.we can probably say that in terms of raw execution – performance on linux versus windows is probably a wash (more or less equivalent) so that the performance of php itself becomes a moot factor in choosing linux or windows for php application deployment.version 1 of the php driver for sql server (v2 is in the works) is somewhat slower than mysql or postpresql but probably not enough to discourage use where diverse developer access is desired.
