with a free operating system, a community of cooperating hackers would be able to use a computer without starting to deprive his or her friend.php, however, is still one of the most popular scripts around thanks to its versatility and the solid, useful applications being written using it.ubuntu linux is not only much secure than windows os, but it also includes free apps and renders safe and fast web browsing.however, the learning curve in asp or asp(dot)net is much steeper than in php – something that can backfire for advanced users looking for greater control and freedom.depending on your budget, security concerns and familiarity with the computer language, you can pick either of them and successfully run a dynamic website for a long time to come.this software is very easy to use and you can create professional documents, spreadsheets and presentations.you have the freedom to distribute modified versions of the program, so that the community can benefit from your improvements.however, cross-platform scripting will never give the smooth performance that a program does when run on its native platform – it is a bit like using emulators to run programs that are not native to the os.linux here is substantially cheaper, as it is an open-source system, and most of its applications are also under gnu public licenses – in other words, free.it will be necessary to learn from new software, a new interface, with a new manner of making.(to make this freedom effective in practice, you must have access to the source code, since making changes in a program without having the source code is exceedingly difficult.)a. linux is free and it comes with a licence known as “gnu gpl”, which grants free use, free access to the source code (linux distributions often come with both binaries and the source code), freedom to copy, modify and distribute it.linux php hosting are generally more cheaper and faster compare to windows asp hosting.most of these distributors add up their own features, targeting specific areas like enterprise, desktop, multimedia etc., to the existing gnu system, to cater diverse user sections.there is one exception here, though – php runs equally well on windows and linux, so linux-based hosting is no longer essential to run php-based scripts and applications.
