make it easier to add toolbar buttons for vtm scripts and apps it would make it far easier to add add-ins (vtom scripts, etc) if hs could work such that dragging-n-dropping a vtm file over a toolbar would open up the add custom button dialog, already filled in to add it as a button to that toolbar.
related to this is john's suggesion: "it would be useful to be able to edit hs extensions directly from the hs editor.
frontpage extensions provide a way other than ftp to upload web files.
(threads (1) (2)) (ms fp98 server extensions reskit overview) - forum threads here are a few forum threads with a number of hs/asp requests.

it would sure be easier than the currentmany-step method of creating buttons.
- asp requests - asp support wish list - code completion for intrinsic objects and user created objects - stronger asp recognition/color coding - database connection wizard - com object wizard/browser - support (i.e wizards) for remote scripting - an add-on that would dim all the variables on a page for you.
this free debugger is good for developing and debugging asp scripts and also vtom/wsh scripts.
useful function snippets there have got to be lots of small, generic, useful functions that could be put in snippet sets.
this should also work for dropping other executable files over a toolbar.
some servers are set to reject ftp and only use this upload method.

reference material for wsh in general a complete article on using microsoft's script debugger with homesite darren forcier at allaire posted a short write-up on it and mentioned that he might get to write this once things settle there a bit.
see also devguru'sa beginner's guide to using microsoft script debugger more custom dialogs keith collison's asp database dialog proves that we can build vtm dialogs that can generate code based upon easy user inputs for a variety of circumstances.
to submit your own ideas,email me if you like, though the best way to be heard by macromedia is to start an asp thread in thehomesite support forum -and- to submit a note via themacromedia software feature request and bug report form.
if i drop psp.exe, it should help me set up a button to launch it as an application with paths already filled in, and even suggest using %current% in the command line.
- frontpage extensions upload capability (web folders)

easier to put option explicit in the code and see what error messages you get to find any vars you forgot to dim. -jeff)
we could use more of these tools to generate generic or customized-generic code to do common useful tasks in asp.
ie i could write a js or vbs file and have access to the hs application dom via insight and i could also have a "test" option to execute it directly and options to add it straight away to toolbars, menus etc.
right clicking a custom button already in a toolbar would also give me the option to edit it straight away."
