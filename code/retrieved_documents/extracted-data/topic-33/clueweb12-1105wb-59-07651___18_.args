i am sure they can do lots of things the way i want but a large part of this is finding out which is most intuitive and comfortable for me from the get-go.but i just wanted a clean functioning intellisense code ide that would help me create clean code, store the files where i wanted them... very good intellisense... and solid testing/debugging capabilities.i think for a beginner or someone switching from another language or even a non-corporate freelancer working with small teams, that this tool actually adds to the confusion when one wants to minimize the confusion.in visual studio, you also need to put everything into a project (or even a solution which can contain several projects), so visual studio programmers will feel very fast at home.knowing that i have coded with jedit for a long time and have gotten used to that interface is important as well since features that work like they do in jedit (as i have customized it) will be more "intuitive" for me.i would really appreciate it if you can shed any light on that "find" error issue, it will save me a lot of timei find the eclipse site very confusing and it took a while to understand the basic concept of the main framework and finding the components needed to do what i particularly want - it is just not a model i have used before.the open source community is making it better every day, and version 4.4 is just rock solid.its integrated directly with svn and others, and easily configurable to work with xdebug.i use ide's to help me code faster, debug better, and just make my life easier.there are two plugins that cover what i need that are still really betas and i think they will only get better as things move forward.while i still miss ctrl-click on a function to go to its declaration, these are things i am more than willing to give up for a stable ide that runs fast and is fully configurable.i have used webuilder for a few years and love it, but it is not a fully blown ide, rather a superb code editor.anyhow as i returned to become a serious php/mysql developer i found that while trying to ramp up in php/mysql that the eclipse ide was very confusing and just added drastically to the learning curve...it's free and might appeal to those who cannot make friends with eclipse.
