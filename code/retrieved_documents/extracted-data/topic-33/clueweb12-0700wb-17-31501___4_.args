it’s typically found to be the most reliable, stable and efficient system and, as such, it’s commonly used for the demanding environment of web and mail servers.as long as you have a good understanding of how to publish your website and update contents, you can use either operating system.these server applications (such as ftp, web server, dns server, file server etc.) being free, are also very stable.also, keep in mind that if your website contains data that is mostly informational and doesn't need much interactive functionality, you're going to find linux hosting most efficient and cost effective.as mentioned earlier, interactive websites usually rely on asp, php, or perl type languages.a website designed for compatibility with a linux/unix based web server meets the salability requirement easily without making any site wide design changes.if you are using any specialized applications or development platform such as .net for your web site, it is preferable to host with a windows based web server.on the other hand, if your applications are microsoft-specific(for example, asp, .net etc), windows hosting is your only option.you can also incorporate online purchasing and other routine ecommerce functions.of course, other factors such as power supply, network admin skills, and network load etc. also matter when it comes to maintaining the system uptime.basically it means that you can host websites that use different types of server side scripts including .cgi, .pl, .php, and .aspif your website incorporates an online searchable database or interactive chat facilities then windows 2000 or nt will be a better bet in most cases.however, you can still use php and mysql with windows hosting plan if your web host offers these softwares and services.you can still add some interactive content using forms and php/mysql.it will cost a bit more but you’ll get that back in reduced development time and simply better functionality.
