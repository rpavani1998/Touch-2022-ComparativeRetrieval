it would have to compete with the very highest possible image quality settings currently available.component wise, our focus is on the three components that have the biggest influence on gaming performance: the processor, the graphics card and the hard drive.to do that, we've built two very different systems, focussing on the three core components that influence performance.there's little doubt extreme edition processors and the latest multi-billion transistor gpus will spew out unholy benchmark numbers.it transpired, it was much easier for the simple reason that it handled the highest image quality settings much better than we expected.the key here was to keep the identities of the systems and the components included completely concealed.so, what matters isn't making sure that the two systems are running exactly the same level of anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering or shader complexity.tested by keen gamers and as you'll see, the results are frankly astonishing.it's also a resolution that dominates regardless of screen size.finally, we allowed our testers a little time to try out basic pc usage to get a feel for desktop performance: firing up a few apps, surfing the web and watching some high definition video.as well as adding storage performance into the mix, we also asked our testers more specific questions regarding performance and image quality.one reason for this is the undeniable influence that console games have on game engines.it puts a limit on the number of pixels any gaming pc is likely to have to pump out.but our argument is that even at the high end and regardless of screen size, the most likely resolution for gaming is going to be 1,920 x 1,080.chop the frame rate in half and that's a different matter, especially if the result ever dips below 30 frames per second.
