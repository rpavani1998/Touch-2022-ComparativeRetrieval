posted in: compare, depth,gaming of course, everybody knows high-end pc components are piddle-poor value for money.
that doesn't mean we'll be excluding overall system performance entirely.
mostly it was a case of dropping the anti-aliasing from 8x to 4x (though crysis 2 doesn't actually offer proper aa, which is probably a big help) and tweaking just a handful of further settings.
so, while there will always be a few exceptions, we reckon our chosen trio gives a pretty decent picture of overall gaming performance.
our money-no-object rig weighs in at nearly £3,000 for those components alone.
going in, we'd expected that it would be a finely balanced process of playing off image quality settings and frame rates.
as well as adding storage performance into the mix, we also asked our testers more specific questions regarding performance and image quality.
we wanted an unbiased assessment of the in-game experience, something that can be coloured by sitting through a lengthy level load.
one reason for this is the undeniable influence that console games have on game engines.
there's absolutely no question the high-end machine with its ultra-fast ssd storage was much quicker during the installations.
you don't need us to tell you intel's latest £800 six-core monster, the core i7 3960x, isn't eight times as good as a £100 quad-core amd phenom ii.

immediately, that plays into the hands of the cheaper system.
elder scrolls v: skyrim made the cut because it's a super hot title, it looks great, it's fairly demanding and it ticks the large-levels and long-draw distance boxes.
it's to find out whether it makes the slightest difference to the way games look and feel.
the two systems are not required to run at the same image quality settings in-game.
indeed, tuning up the cheapo machine was intriguing.
the challenge will be getting the low-end system right.
our reasoning was to allow roughly £100 each for the low end rig.
but obvious omissions such as, perhaps an mmorpg such as wow don't tend to be hugely performance intensive.
however, one thing you should be very clear about is that we won't be compromising the settings on the high-end rig.
we wanted a driving game in the mix and there's no doubting dirt 3 is a looker.
what does matter is that 1080p pixel grid.
chop the frame rate in half and that's a different matter, especially if the result ever dips below 30 frames per second.
from the outset we'd decided that running at 1080p native resolution was essential, so that bit was easy.
we wanted a driving game in the mix and there's no doubting dirt 3 is a looker.
to do that, we've built two very different systems, focussing on the three core components that influence performance.
there's absolutely no question the high-end machine with its ultra-fast ssd storage was much quicker during the installations.
next was a test starting from the desktop and involving loading, first, the main game interface and then a game level, after which further game play and general impressions were taken.

for the most part, both rigs ran with ultra settings across the board.
it transpired, it was much easier for the simple reason that it handled the highest image quality settings much better than we expected.

it's also a resolution that dominates regardless of screen size.
the system has performance to burn so it was simply a case of maxing everything out and then jumping in-game to make sure everything was running smoothly.
it's to find out whether it makes the slightest difference to the way games look and feel.
our first test involved playing each title from an identical pre-loaded and paused game state without observing level loads or desktop performance.
with all that in mind, it's clear that this entire experiment is heavy on the subjectivity.
the xbox 360 and ps3 are positively ancient but retain an iron grip over game development.
none of that, however, is the same as saying high-end clobber doesn't deliver any benefits for the cost.
our testers were allowed around ten minutes per title to jump back and forth between machines, as often as they liked.
both machines were up and running at the same time on the same desk and via the same 24-inch high quality 1080p monitor.
moreover, 1080p has become the de facto standard for many games.

in fact, we didn't even want our testers knowing what an enormous gulf in hardware specification they were experiencing.

instead, all our testers knew was that they were comparing the gaming experience on two different systems.

in which case, you'll have to compromise on screen size, since the highest resolution monitors are not the largest.
the challenge will be getting the low-end system right.
the key here was to keep the identities of the systems and the components included completely concealed.
our task this month isn't merely to prove that spending a shedload on the finest pc components isn't cost effective.
the bottom line is that we needed to do relatively little to get our affordable pc running smoothly.

the final part of the puzzle is the actual blind comparison.
image quality, on the other hand, is a different matter.

putting it another way, if we plonked you down in front of two pcs, one trimmed out with the finest kit known to man, one built down to a modest price point, and fired up your favourite games, would you actually be able to see or feel the difference?

so, what matters isn't making sure that the two systems are running exactly the same level of anti-aliasing, anisotropic filtering or shader complexity.
