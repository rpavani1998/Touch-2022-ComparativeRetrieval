a shape began to form in the light, massive and dark, its outline humanoid, but surely too large for an eldar warrior.
distances are indeed too vague, but this still speaks of very high velocities and maneuverability, as well as piloting skill and reaction time, to do that without plotting a pre-calculated course.
the structure of this matrix also suggests some sort of energy-storage system.
sgcombine december 26, 2011 at 12:21 pm - #24 @cell as awesome as that cinematic was, i’m afriad it’s fan made.
most of the world’s atmosphere was burning now, torn away from the orb in a veil that trailed it in orbit, and what was left spiraled in hurricanes and tornadoes, until destroyed by more beams.
i have to keep swann away from that sample; he will definitely shoot it out the airlock.
in place of the khala’s bright energies, the dark templar learned to manipulate the darker powers of the void, which gave the dark templar the ability to become invisible at will.
- and ship to ship teleporting doesn’t need webway gates or beacons.
or even manufacture structures capable of hot landings from orbital origins with acceptable stresses.
however, as we get to the bigger weapons, there’s a marked increase in power output and destructive potential.
the quotes i saw for protoss say there weapons go through the crust and cause all the magma to come up and burn the planet, or something like that.
everything from wh40k is overpowered.
because as most of you know, protoss ship firepower is easily in the teraton or higher range judging from screenshots of how they ‘purify’ planets.
terran warp drives clock at 1000-20000 ly a day, and they’ve got nothing on the protoss.
it’d be a good idea to find out how long it takes the protoss to charge up.
you charge up a weapon like that before going in to a hot situation.
and touching one would be like touching a glowing red hot frying pan.
they were targeting the cities and making sure that nothing could survive there.
“although their abilities are already impressive, high templar and dark templar can wield even greater might by laying down their lives to merge their souls and form archons.
in battle, carriers appear to be virtual hornet’s nests of activity as their small allies dart swiftly in and out, alternating between attacking enemies and repairing damage.
why isn’t my post being posted >=( @dem i would include ground battles, but they will be almost irrelevant, however, exarchs are not to be trifled with.”
many of these massive vessels are armed with powerful beam weapons, and a fleet of protoss carriers can employ said beam weapons to eradicate all life on the face of an earthlike planet in seconds- cracking open
armed with wraithcannons these giants are fearsome opponents.-gw www.games-workshop.com/media_customproductcatalog/m1241344_99060104005_maughanramain_445x319.jpg -re:link list of the phoenix kings, and correcting myself they are the first of their aspects and generally the best.

protoss tech is crazy advanced.
unlike most other protoss robots, the colossus was created purely for destruction.
as the harlequins perform their dance of death, the shadowseer will release programmed hallucination grenades from their backpack to distract and bewilder the enemy.
not all carriers rely solely on their interceptor fleets however.
now red volcanic glows covered the northern hemisphere of mar sara like welts.

their psychicness is much more offensively devastating, at least from what i’ve seen thus far.
in the centuries since, these primary command ships had departed the field of battle and become holy shrines, venerated by mystics and historians.
zealots are peerless warriors who have yet to ascend to the uppermost ranks of the khala.
i don’t know much about either, but i assume that since the elders are from wh40k they’ll most likely win.
the maneuvering took place while the guy was holding off a bunch of zerg inside the ship.
the robot’s beam attack cuts a broad swath across its targets, making the colossus an ideal anti-infantry weapon.
air itself was torn away from the planet by the force of the blows.
@galorian noted ,however it is still a incredibly good article that should help you in any debates abound starcraft where so many people go “it can’t be a guass rifle as it has shell casing or something something…”the author has a resonable explanation for those.
if the sun was nearly depleted it would either be massive and red (still emiting large amounts of red light), gone supernova or shrunken into a brown dwarf or a neutron star.
the protoss seemed to be doing pretty well against guys like the tau, so far(among other 40k factions barring the likes of the iom, forces of chaos or the nids, since those 3 factions are too big on their own to fight off!)
it’s true that their numbers are small, but that’s in comparison to the orks and imperium whos numbers are in the trillions.
over all they are fairly strong, however khaine’s useless outside of his avatars, and the lg is just a trickster.
their formidable physiques are further enhanced by cybernetic implants and power suits.
planetoids are hundreds of kilometres wide.
the imperial navy attacked a craftworld and lost their entire sector fleet.
reaper273 december 26, 2011 at 11:07 am - #10 bugger, always forgetting things.
and of course, the dark templars- “the dark templar are powerful psionic warriors whose ancestors resettled on the planet shakuras after they were exiled from the protoss homeworld of aiur for refusing to join the emerging khala, the communal mind link shared by the entire race.
keep in mind that starcraft psionics completely ignore tensile strength, affecting neosteel just as well as it affects glass.
zealots are peerless warriors who have yet to ascend to the uppermost ranks of the khala.
the protoss population is fairly small, stated to be in the billions spread over an interstellar empire, but not elaborated on beyond that.
their fleets themselves are made up mostly of carriers- “the massive carriers serve as operation centers for leaders of the protoss fleet.
idk, that place just seems to throw me into rage mode every time i go there.
it was hilarious though.
keep in mind that starcraft psionics completely ignore tensile strength, affecting neosteel just as well as it affects glass.
it’s mantle like an egg and allowing oceans of magma to drown it’s surface and evicting it’s atmosphere with the force of the blasts.
unless the shurikans (and these monofilimant things the dark reapers shoot) have a large enough mass that sharpness will be useless against protoss shields to a very large degree.
any place of human settlement.
nearly all eldar basic ‘projectile’ weapons are based on very, very sharp things moving very fast.

ok … what about the warp spiders … with their warp gen jump packs … whats stopping them from warping into the ships placing charges and warping out … not to mention their use in ground fighting to do similar guerilla warfare tactics @sgcombine the dark eldar aren’t with chaos, they are separate, but do have occasional demonic things happen, but alright, assuming they are out it is craftworld eldar, exodites, harlequins.
the psychic strength of these dead spirits, focused and amplified by the titan’s wraithbone structure is phenomenal, far outstripping the powers of the living.-gw - -phantom titans-built around a wraithbone core, phantom titans are very different from other races titan’s, because not only do they benefit from the experience of their crew who are raised with the titan from birth, but also from the collective consciousness of spirit stones contained within the titan.-gw - revenant titans-the smallest of the eldar titans, the revenant’s compact size allows it to move with a swiftness and smoothness quite simply impossible for the war machines of other races.
the eldar do have cooler mechs… “for this battle, the protoss are at the height of their power, elders are current incarnation.”
the protoss have such powerful psionic abilities that their presence inadvertently disrupts other life-forms.
i’ll find a quote if i can, but if someone else could mention it, that’d be great.
with a swift corkscrew spin, zoraya drove the vessel toward the center of the rock and stopped just above the surface.
the maneuvering took place while the guy was holding off a bunch of zerg inside the ship.
nico’s sword can fight and kill: ghosts, monsters, and humans.
the storm of silence jain zar is the phoenix lord of the howling banshee aspect warriors.
they also use holofields, which makes it nigh impossible to hit them unless you put out enough firepower to blanket the entire area of space they might occupy.
furthermore, prepping a weapon for fire is done differently in a combat situation that it’s done under safer conditions-
mj at the low end, and above 388 mj at the high end (a full clip of terran marine c-14 rounds doesn’t take it down, the calcs are for the smaller 250 round clip and mach 5 rounds for the low end, and the larger 500 round clip and mach 10 rounds for the high end).

and where the beams struck the surface, they erupted, boiling the ground where they struck, uprooting both the creep-infested lands and those that had not yet been infected.
they unleashed storm after storm of sliver-thin blades, and the bodies of the alien killer-beasts piled high.
“unless we are assuming they only use their ‘main weapon’ for purification.
the eldar cannot use the warp for more than a few small puddle jumps since they do not have the equivalent of an astropath like the imperium.
they were targeting the cities and making sure that nothing could survive there.
-medusa v report as we all know, dire avengers, rangers and guardians are the ‘regular’ infantry units.
- that is true, but i’m pretty sure the attacks they have to glass a planet are different than ship-to-ship weapons.
marius scrambled to the edge of the ruins with julius beside him and looked down at the strange alien gateway.
it strides across the battlefield on four tall, slender legs that allow it to cross steep elevations with ease.
i’m learning so much from this crystal, but i can’t help feeling as if it’s learning from me, if that makes sense.
they could webway teleport in behind a protoss ship, empty a broadside and be gone when the ship turns comes around to fire back, then reteleport in behind the ship again, and teleport boarding parties into the ship and be gone before they could come about again.
deadly rainbow radiation, more brilliant than mike had ever seen, spiraled out from the impact points, churning earth and water mercilessly, distorting the matter of the planet itself.
disaster i’ve only discovered the forums like a week ago or so, but for some reason i can’t help but flame everyone there .
a few score dire avenger aspect warriors took up position in the narrowest part of the chasm leading towards the webway gate.
the chitinous bodies of alien organisms became a mountain that the dire avengers scaled step-by-step, raining down a curtain of fire upon those that tried to clamber up the bodies of their kin.
as they were powerful psykers in life, so too are they in death.
the skyholder’s quote from the titan’s curse will be of use, make no mistake about that.
craftworlds cannot use the warp at all, but they can use the wg.
i would doubt, however, that after the first volley the main weapons would be close to the planet-glassing level, seeing as they had a charge-up time for such strength.
the cry of the wind baharroth is believed to be the finest pupil of asurmen.

these towering machines can carve through even protoss armies with frighting ease- in fluff each sweep of their thermal lances vaporizes anything in it’s path without slowing down, be it dark templars, zealots or even entire structures- “the towering colossus is a protoss robot design dating back to the bloody conflicts of the kalath intercession.
their elite units, striking scorpions, dark reapers, warp spiders, howling banshees, swooping hawks, etc, would be able to counter just about anything the protos can through at them.
it’s mantle like an egg and allowing oceans of magma to drown it’s surface and evicting it’s atmosphere with the force of the blasts.
- i read the previous few pages and the next few to get some context for that and it is clear that whoever wrote that has no understanding of science whatsoever.
- same here , thats why i suggested this match, i wanted to learn a bit more about both sides.
these unified protoss spirits radiate incalculable power, unleashing psionic barrages against cowering enemy forces both in the air and on the ground.
most of the world’s atmosphere was burning now, torn away from the orb in a veil that trailed it in orbit, and what was left spiraled in hurricanes and tornadoes, until destroyed by more beams.
magma pushed to the surface, consuming everything that had been uprooted by the energy beams.
also you don’t necessarily have to take any sides to the match as of yet, just request both sides to let me provide the skyholding quotes and the quotes where the children of hades are shown to be able to banish ghosts(since phantoon’s a ghost, then regardless of whether or not the thing’s even alive, elemental compatibility rules will affect that thing!) from the battle of the labyrinth, because if they don’t work, i’m gunna have to go for broke and get to the last olympian quotes involving nico in them, alright?
@tau so far we’re just discussing the weapons along with other matters of technology that may be of use.
that gives me an idea: using our own containment technology, i could modify our scv manufacturing process to double capacity with no increased risk.
on the ice-fields of articus a million-strong swarm of tyranids poured down the ice-plains towards the chasms that held the last of the open webway portals.
when wielding this force, these vessels can instantly destroy squadrons of enemy ships or even entire planets.”

“also no time frame or distances are given, so trying to draw solid conclusions from that error ridden segment is hopeless.”
in an odd coincidence, the warping slowed just enough for my sensors to pick it up.
all motherships hold a huge khaydarin crystal infused with enough psionic energy to distort the very fabric of time and space.

a mighty spear tip emerged first, blazing runic symbols writhing on its wide blade, followed by a brazen arm that bled molten light into the air.
hmmm, i stated current incarnation, which is just the craftworld eldar right, since the dark eldar are with chaos if i’m not mistaken.
they are not even akin to vast cities, as some of the largest star forts of the imperium might be considered, but rather are immense spacefaring worlds accompanied by vast armadas, the likes of which might otherwise be set aside to defend an entire system or even sub-sector.
“also no time frame or distances are given, so trying to draw solid conclusions from that error ridden segment is hopeless.”
fire dragons shoot fusion weapons, warp spiders shoot mono-filament wire webs, brightlances can cut through adamantium, warlocks&farseers can kill with their minds.
d-cannons particularly don’t rely on armour penetration, so much as tearing a hole in space and letting the gravitational pull of a warp rift tear their foes into pieces, or else suck them into a different realm.
better feats later my source site is being unresponsive.
and was wielding a sword with a warp stone embedded in the hilt, and slaaneshi daemon in side of it.

nothing could survive the assault, human or otherwise.
with the reunification of the protoss race, any pair of high templar or dark templar, or even one of each, can be fused together.
these zealots are also capable of momentarily turn their body into pure energy, allowing them brief bursts of literal “lightning speed” they use to close the distance to their opponents- “for more than a thousand years, the protoss of the templar caste have defended their people, dedicating their long lives to the pursuit of martial perfection.
but i digress, that match was part of the terrible trio of factpile fights, so i may or may not be biased.
as long as a wg is near by the eldar can transport themselves and ships to that area.
i could be wrong, but my point is that ship-to-ship is never shown in the range of the planet-busters.
however, the size of the protoss industrial capacity and military are far beyond what could be expected from their population thanks the the complete automation of their industry, their ability to teleport whole structures across interstellar distances, their reliance on robotic labor and war machines and the low crew requirements of their ships.
equipped with jump jets, pulse lasers and missile launchers, the revenant titans’s hunt in packs making lightning quick raids before dissapearing with the same terrifying speed.-gw - wraithlords-towering over its foes, the wraith lord is controlled by the essence of one of the craftworld’s mightiest warriors.
i read that there aren’t many protoss , and that the eldars are mainly refugees.
their crystals are both their computers and their power source, and are amazing in both respects.
- i read the previous few pages and the next few to get some context for that and it is clear that whoever wrote that has no understanding of science whatsoever.
their weapons were upraised, and they were chantingin a language that sounded more like song than communication.
i think we might be able to contain energies that once required huge machines.
the quotes i saw for protoss say there weapons go through the crust and cause all the magma to come up and burn the planet, or something like that.
whole battlefleets cluster around key points and stations all across the thousands of miles of the craftworld’s exterior as smaller, nimbler craft rush and surge across its surface in a constant shimmering patrol. ”
the protoss also possess powerful robotic war machines- the colossi.
forums.spacebattles.com/showthread.php?t=157307 @tau43 i don’t know much about the elder, but i think when they were made they were meant to defeat chaos, so i figured that elder at the height of their power would just rofl stomp the protoss, current seemed more fair.
aelfinn december 26, 2011 at 11:52 am - #16 “protoss ship firepower is easily in the teraton or higher range judging from screenshots of how they ‘purify’ planets.”
followers of the cunning deity known as the laughing god, they are the strangest and most inscrutable of all the eldar.
it’s getting pure energy from that sphere above it, which presents a new worry.
@c.c. “its not, as for all i care even the 1st c.h.b group fight(against the guardians of tourain) is loads better, and the lack of back-up for c.h.b in numbers is ticking me off.”
if swann suspects, he’ll drop it out the airlock, and that would be a tragedy.
- unless we are assuming they only use their ‘main weapon’ for purification.
i don’t understand how the protoss can possess technology of this magnitude and not rule the known universe.
so even if a target was invincible, the eldar do not need to destroy it they can just make it go away.
d-cannons particularly don’t rely on armour penetration, so much as tearing a hole in space and letting the gravitational pull of a warp rift tear their foes into pieces, or else suck them into a different realm.
so far i think the protoss seem to have the upper hand.

during wings of liberty your science guy has you collect fragments of such crystals throughout the game and studies them over time.
- that is true, but i’m pretty sure the attacks they have to glass a planet are different than ship-to-ship weapons.
a few things are wrong in his analysis- . 1) first off, the dominion officially switched over to depleted uranium spikes, as opposed to the less conformed confederacy era c-14 ammo.
the only real advantage i can see for the eldar is their speed.
it is non-organic but has a molecular structure as diverse and complex as any organism’s.
i think most eldar ships only manage to fight imperial ships because they’re so fast and difficult to target because of their holofields, not to mention their maneuverability can keep them out of most imperial ship firing arcs during a fight.
in place of the khala’s bright energies, the dark templar learned to manipulate the darker powers of the void, which gave the dark templar the ability to become invisible at will.
it looks so professionally done, i would actually mistake it for an in-game cutscene.
this also shows the strength of the protoss shields which reguarly tanks those hypersonic rounds.

commander cross december 26, 2011 at 11:23 am - #11 the protoss seemed to be doing pretty well against guys like the tau, so far(among other 40k factions barring the likes of the iom, forces of chaos or the nids, since those 3 factions are too big on their own to fight off!)
as dangerous as that is, against shields it doesn’t matter how sharp the object is.
- also no time frame or distances are given, so trying to draw solid conclusions from that error ridden segment is hopeless.
@tau i meant in this fight thread going on between the eldar and the protoss.
no one knows where karandras originally came from, but it is known that he was not the first exarch of the striking scorpions.
distances are indeed too vague, but this still speaks of very high velocities and maneuverability, as well as piloting skill and reaction time, to do that without plotting a pre-calculated course.

tau43 december 26, 2011 at 12:46 pm - #29 the protoss may win this.
the energy in this crystal is not kept in a vortex pattern.
the colossus’ heavily armored hull carries two powerful thermal lances, with one on each side of its body.
while their ships and mechs a freaky fast and strong and their specialty troops are good, there is not really a lot of them left, and most of their gods are shattered(like khaine) or destroyed (like asuryan) or relatively weak(like the laughing god).
the sky itself curdled as the beams pierced through the atmospheric envelope.
i would doubt, however, that after the first volley the main weapons would be close to the planet-glassing level, seeing as they had a charge-up time for such strength.”
- www.youtube.com/watch?v=djtgxjringi - it doesn’t actually show a large charge-up time, and they appear to be using similar weapons to attack the terran ships.

the proximity beacon began to flash enthusiastically on the viewscreen as the ship’s destination, a hollowed tooth of an asteroid, spun closer into view.
zoraya accelerated into the asteroid field, swerving expertly to avoid numerous meteors and planetoids.
iirc, entering or exiting the webway requires a webway gate – webway gates are usually found in the form of fixed structures and of varying sizes.
you do not swerve to avoid them, you plot a course that avoids them well in advance, it’s not like they sneak up on you.
for instance, if there is a wg on a moon, the eldar can warp onto the planet or if the wg is in good condition and strong enough (many of the gates have become weak over the eons) then they can transport their fleets around the moon.
i’d say that a population that seems mainly “united” is better than a bunch of refugees.
the proximity beacon began to flash enthusiastically on the viewscreen as the ship’s destination, a hollowed tooth of an asteroid, spun closer into view.
- the reason i asked about what “at the height of their power” meant was because i wanted to make sure that vehicles/techs/units developed at a later date where not used at all.
craftworlds are between 10-100 km depending on their population (they grow and shrink based on the eb of psychic energy/souls).
i dont know how fast the protoss are, but in ‘path of the warrior” a striking scorpion watches a sm bolter round moving like it’s in slow motion.
the eldar mostly live on craftworlds and there could be hundreds of those.
with careful guidance, high templar can learn to augment this effect, creating storms of raw psionic energy that can tear apart the minds of lesser species.”
if the sun was nearly depleted it would either be massive and red (still emiting large amounts of red light), gone supernova or shrunken into a brown dwarf or a neutron star.
the safety checks alone can take hours.
i’m now convinced that the crystal is drawing power from the ship, but in ways so subtle as to be undetectable.
maugan-ra reaps a high toll of blood from those who oppose the eldar.
if so, i can go and get the feats for nico from the novel, someone might have to provide cover-fire in the quotes for feats and fighting capabilities from the other 4 novels.
the limb groaned like hot iron as it flexed and the body it belonged to emerged from the gateway.”
even if that were so, fluff plainly states that motherships can instantly destroy planets.
i figured out where it is putting all that excess energy.
also, to clear up some things: warp gates- wgs are more like relay beacons than gates.

galorian december 26, 2011 at 11:32 am - #12 terran warp drives clock at 1000-20000 ly a day, and they’ve got nothing on the protoss.
they crossed 60,000 lightyears in a span of time that wasn’t sufficiently well defined to narrow it down further.
mj at the low end, and above 388 mj at the high end (a full clip of terran marine c-14 rounds doesn’t take it down, the calcs are for the smaller 250 round clip and mach 5 rounds for the low end, and the larger 500 round clip and mach 10 rounds for the high end).
although they excel in physical combat, high templar prefer to use psionic attacks that they have developed through intensive training.
the c-14 is designed to over-penetrate and everything is made of future-metals, so trying to gauge it’s power from it’s performance is pointless.
my battalion can prep and fire an artillery round very quickly during an emergency or when simulating combat using dud ammo, but when not pressed and dealing with live ammunition (such as when preforming live fire during an exercise)
dark eldar no. @skalkorik, warp spiders make small jumps, maybe a few killometers or shorter at a time.
in the case of the protoss ship mounted directed energy weapons they’d probably give them greater safety margins on the charge up sequence, double check everything, wait for the entire fleet to be ready and finally stand by for the executor’s express fire command before pushing the big red button.
sometimes accompanied by a troupe master, shadowseer and a death jester, the harlequins are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield.-gw - then phoenix lords who are the best at whatever their aspect is.
like all phoenix lords fuegan has been re-born many times giving him thousands of years of experience.
interceptors are maneuverable, computer-guided crafts that can tear through flight formations and relentlessly strafe slower ground targets with their plasma charges.
the spirits of mighty eldar seers and warlocks.
after all, that was a coordinated fleet action and the planet wasn’t going anywhere… @iamtaco .
hole not whole my bad @tau your assistance is greatly appreciated, then.
however, their strongest assets are the craftworlds (assuming just craftworld eldar).
unlike most other protoss robots, the colossus was created purely for destruction.
judging by the size of the mags each spike is around 150mm long (which is consistent with the length/width ratio of modern day sabot rounds and with the fact that the spikes are said to nail zerg to walls).
when the eldar fight with the avatar their can shrug off damage they normally wouldn’t, they are much faster, stronger and are almost as blood seeking as a berserker.
the colossus’ heavily armored hull carries two powerful thermal lances, with one on each side of its body.
luckily, i found some cast-off chips floating in the tank.
their firepower is in fact higher than the imperium’s firepower, but their ships are much more fragile, but still able to tank the petaton blasts from the imperium.
i would doubt, however, that after the first volley the main weapons would be close to the planet-glassing level, seeing as they had a charge-up time for such strength.”
liberty’s crusade chapter 8 “even if that were so, fluff plainly states that motherships can instantly destroy planets.
these unified protoss spirits radiate incalculable power, unleashing psionic barrages against cowering enemy forces both in the air and on the ground.
their fleets themselves are made up mostly of carriers- “the massive carriers serve as operation centers for leaders of the protoss fleet.
the rangers of alaitoc alerted the forces stationed below of there approach, but the perimiter forces left to protect the farseers had become so thin that there was no real hope.
the guardians of tourain) is loads better, and the lack of back-up for c.h.b in numbers is ticking me off.
it was warping the energy around so fast that i couldn’t detect it.
i’ve just observed the smallest details from it and somehow wrangled a few tidbits when the crystal… helped me.
i would include ground battles, but they will be almost irrelevant, however, exarchs are not to be trifled with.
then other ships began firing thinner beams with surgical accuracy, adding to the barrage in places.
as for the got vs the camp half-blood campers fight, we’re gonna have to be quick if we want to avert an outright stomp!-fest.
the hand of asur- the eldar believe that asurmen was the first of the phoenix lords.
able to be equipped with a wide variety of heavy weapons, assault weapons and even a close combat weapon the wraithlord is an extremely versatile component in the eldar battleplan.-gw - and wraithguard- constructed from wraithbone, wraithguard are not living warriors, they are constructs which house a spirit stone containing the soul of an eldar warrior.
@tau, it’s an awesome post maybe the best one here.
@cell since elder ships have to fight off imperium ships, which are said to pack petaton per volley and shields of similar strength, i would think its somewhere in that range for the elders.
-foot sloggers shouldn’t be discounted because they can still do boarding actions.
the avatar of khaine- you cant just mass produce these guys.
maneuvering around several planetoids inside an asteroid field in the span of seconds.
you do not swerve to avoid them, you plot a course that avoids them well in advance, it’s not like they sneak up on you.
equipped with the shuriken shrieker cannon, the only noise that can be heard over the shriek of the gun is the mocking laughter of the death jester as he eviscerates his foe”.-gw - then normal harlequins-for the warrior dancers of the harlequins, there is no distinction between art and war.
unless the shurikans (and these monofilimant things the dark reapers shoot) have a large enough mass that sharpness will be useless against protoss shields to a very large degree.
if a fleet in orbit must charge the weapons, we either assume for some reason it’s not part of the protoss standard operations to charge before arriving at a battle zone, or it takes them a long time to charge their weapons.
any place of human settlement.
with careful guidance, high templar can learn to augment this effect, creating storms of raw psionic energy that can tear apart the minds of lesser species.”
taking time of arrival to how long until they fire seems to be the best route, with zero seconds =
- also no time frame or distances are given, so trying to draw solid conclusions from that error ridden segment is hopeless.
in the dark templar saga, the ships made “jumps” or something like that.
jain zar has travelled widely across the webway, and so it is that the howling banshees can be found on all but the remotest craftworld.
yes, i read that, but i couldn’t tell exactly what their psionic abilities were.
but the loss of aiur has convinced the protoss to resurrect their oldest and most powerful weapons.
this sample could lead to huge breakthroughs for the raiders.
height of power for the protoss would be back when they were sending out their great fleets everywhere, led by their motherships- “during the golden age of protoss expansion, motherships led vast armadas throughout deep space.
itcheyness december 26, 2011 at 11:58 am - #20 i think most eldar ships only manage to fight imperial ships because they’re so fast and difficult to target because of their holofields, not to mention their maneuverability can keep them out of most imperial ship firing arcs during a fight.
except from ‘doom of the eldar’ bfg supplement pdf: “craftworlds, though spacecraft, are vast beyond comprehension.
high templars would also prove problematic on the battlefield- their regular combat capabilities are greater than those of zealots (as the high templars rise from the zealot’s ranks), and their psichic powers are sufficient so that in fluff just one of their number was able to bring down a squadron of terran battlecruisers with a psichic storm- “the high templar are the most seasoned warriors of the protoss armies, an elite cadre who have advanced far beyond the zealots to attain an even higher plane of martial focus.
the protoss also tend to suffer very few casualties in battle, as their suits automatically teleport them to the nearest medical facility upon critical injury or system failure.
the robot’s beam attack cuts a broad swath across its targets, making the colossus an ideal anti-infantry weapon.
twinky i thought the protoss have that ability too.
interceptors are maneuverable, computer-guided crafts that can tear through flight formations and relentlessly strafe slower ground targets with their plasma charges.
if they can, however, then it’s gonna be one messed up battle.
the eldar are not as outnumbered as most would think.
they are much faster than imperial ships, usually flying literal circles around them, and the imperial ships fly around .75c at combat speed.
“protoss ship firepower is easily in the teraton or higher range judging from screenshots of how they ‘purify’ planets.”
because as most of you know, protoss ship firepower is easily in the teraton or higher range judging from screenshots of how they ‘purify’ planets.
the foe was still without number, and here an there an alien talon would bypass the defences of the exarch and take another eldar life.
armed with their potent warp blades, the dark templar are deadly and relentless foes capable of devastating conventional forces.
either way it also sounds like they probably engage in battle with out charging their weapons up to this point regularly.
hell, we once had to cancel a live fire exercise because by the time the safety checks were done it was dark and the higher-ups preferred not to risk it… .
their formidable physiques are further enhanced by cybernetic implants and power suits.
the eldar fielding a avatar of khaine.
i tried scraping smaller samples, but all my tools broke.
you can simply divide to find a direct percentage to figure out how long it would take them to charge up to the level needed to hurt an eldar ship.
i’m hoping someone with “path of the warrior ” will turn up and drop some calculatable feats for us, because the eldar are woefully under-represented.
the eldar would be in this battle with 9-10 craftworlds.
a gathering of warriors surrounded the light, which flickered and danced like a candle flame.
as awesome as that cinematic was, i’m afriad it’s fan made.
then you should also know that the webway is useful for strategic movement – not tactical maneuvers in combat as you previously suggested.
which will be plenty for taking out the protoss.
however, as we get to the bigger weapons, there’s a marked increase in power output and destructive potential.
as the ice turned dark with the sheer number of vile, scuttling beasts coming for them, the dire avengers began to kill.
the protoss may win this.
deadly rainbow radiation, more brilliant than mike had ever seen, spiraled out from the impact points, churning earth and water mercilessly, distorting the matter of the planet itself.
they are not merely huge capital ships ploughing through space with a surrounding escort of smaller vessels.
armed with their potent warp blades, the dark templar are deadly and relentless foes capable of devastating conventional forces.
if the situation becomes particularly dire, two or more high templars could join to form archons, who’s psichic power’s are orders of magnitude greater, if short lived-
the protoss also tend to suffer very few casualties in battle, as their suits automatically teleport them to the nearest medical facility upon critical injury or system failure.
these towering machines can carve through even protoss armies with frighting ease- in fluff each sweep of their thermal lances vaporizes anything in it’s path without slowing down, be it dark templars, zealots or even entire structures- “the towering colossus is a protoss robot design dating back to the bloody conflicts of the kalath intercession.
subtly helping to power the ship, balancing out some of the more ragged systems.
sgcombine december 26, 2011 at 11:50 am - #15 @cell since elder ships have to fight off imperium ships, which are said to pack petaton per volley and shields of similar strength, i would think its somewhere in that range for the elders.
magma pushed to the surface, consuming everything that had been uprooted by the energy beams.
“@sgcombine the dark eldar aren’t with chaos, they are separate, but do have occasional demonic things happen, but alright, assuming they are out it is craftworld eldar, exodites, harlequins.
and of course, the dark templars- “the dark templar are powerful psionic warriors whose ancestors resettled on the planet shakuras after they were exiled from the protoss homeworld of aiur for refusing to join the emerging khala, the communal mind link shared by the entire race.
- www.youtube.com/watch?v=djtgxjringi - it doesn’t actually show a large charge-up time, and they appear to be using similar weapons to attack the terran ships.
in the dark templar saga, the ships made “jumps” or something like that.
note: elders are claimed to be the second most advanced race in the warhammer 40k verse, surpassed only by the necrons.
they crossed 60,000 lightyears in a span of time that wasn’t sufficiently well defined to narrow it down further.
i could be wrong, but my point is that ship-to-ship is never shown in the range of the planet-busters.
zealots use their substantial psionic abilities to create blades of pure energy that serve as their primary melee weapons.”
all motherships hold a huge khaydarin crystal infused with enough psionic energy to distort the very fabric of time and space.
no one goes around with a chambered round in his weapon unless he’s in a combat situation, and the same goes for any other weapon out there (save some kinds of missile tubes).
then other ships began firing thinner beams with surgical accuracy, adding to the barrage in places.
swann is excited that the ship is running so well, but he has no idea why.
“@tau43 – then you should also know that the webway is useful for strategic movement – not tactical maneuvers in combat as you previously suggested.”
i’m hoping someone with “path of the warrior ” will turn up and drop some calculatable feats for us, because the eldar are woefully under-represented.
she is the most swift and ferocious of the phoenix lords.
maugan-ra reaps a high toll of blood from those who oppose the eldar.-gw - then their armor: -storm serpent-the storm serpent carries a wraithgate webway portal, making it a heavily armoured and mobile wraithgate; no one expects troops to spew forth from the belly of a super heavy tank, let alone whole warhosts!-gw - -warlock titan-a warlock titan contains within it’s wraithbone core.
it’s a nice article, but ultimately it underestimated the firepower of the c-14 by about a factor of 10.
they are nigh unassailable, even imperial fleets are crushed against them, they are planet or even star sized in certain cases, and can easily drive by and bombard a planet to cinders with exotic weapons, including dark matter guns.
high templars would also prove problematic on the battlefield- their regular combat capabilities are greater than those of zealots (as the high templars rise from the zealot’s ranks), and their psichic powers are sufficient so that in fluff just one of their number was able to bring down a squadron of terran battlecruisers with a psichic storm- “the high templar are the most seasoned warriors of the protoss armies, an elite cadre who have advanced far beyond the zealots to attain an even higher plane of martial focus.
they probably can use their planet glassing technique on other ships but the time it takes to be able to do this makes it so that their ships would be more like tank destroyers trying to fight tanks due to the lack of grace in this fighting style.
it strides across the battlefield on four tall, slender legs that allow it to cross steep elevations with ease.
on the less upbeat end of things, the level of energy stored in the crystal’s matrix has not increased at all, despite the fact that the crystal continues to grow.
an alloy based on this crystal would have impressive damage mitigation.
it’s developed an intricate matrix that makes it tough and surprisingly flexible.
it requires days of prayer and the sacrifice of a great warrior.
heavily armored and shielded, carriers can punch their way through enemy blockades by unleashing flights of robotic interceptors.
however, the size of the protoss industrial capacity and military are far beyond what could be expected from their population thanks the the complete automation of their industry, their ability to teleport whole structures across interstellar distances, their reliance on robotic labor and war machines and the low crew requirements of their ships.
as far as the eldar heavy weapons, the eldar cobra uses distortion cannon which tears reality apart and sucks everything around it into the warp.
height of power for the protoss would be back when they were sending out their great fleets everywhere, led by their motherships- “during the golden age of protoss expansion, motherships led vast armadas throughout deep space.
considering eldar can summon avatars of war and the like they should win in groundbattle … otherwise it should somewhat even … protoss have nearly every unit with shileding and strong psykers … eldar have very specialised units and psykers on ther own whoo hoo first post on factpile.
zealots use their substantial psionic abilities to create blades of pure energy that serve as their primary melee weapons.”
if i can reverse engineer this fabricator, i could do amazing things with automated repair, or even near-instant manufacturing of advanced ai weaponry.
when wielding this force, these vessels can instantly destroy squadrons of enemy ships or even entire planets.”
i’ll find a quote if i can, but if someone else could mention it, that’d be great.
each phoenix lord is the master of one of the aspect temples.
i placed the crystal in saline solution for storage.
meteors don’t exist in asteroid fields.
and where the beams struck the surface, they erupted, boiling the ground where they struck, uprooting both the creep-infested lands and those that had not yet been infected.
helped take out one of the famous nyc bridges.
their psychicness is much more offensively devastating, at least from what i’ve seen thus far.
heavily armored and shielded, carriers can punch their way through enemy blockades by unleashing flights of robotic interceptors.
in any case, the chips revealed more of the matrix.
if the situation becomes particularly dire, two or more high templars could join to form archons, who’s psichic power’s are orders of magnitude greater, if short lived-
for all its complexity, the matrix is as solid as the strongest structure.
marius supposed it must lead to the craftworld above,which explained why they had not detected any ships leaving the craftworld, and how the eldar reached the surface of tarsis first.
- -eldar phoenix lord karandras, the shadow hunter karandras is one of the eldar phoenix lords.
the sky itself curdled as the beams pierced through the atmospheric envelope.
the protoss have such powerful psionic abilities that their presence inadvertently disrupts other life-forms.
- “death jesters-the death jesters are heavy weapon specialists, sinister warriors who stand apart from their fellow harlequins and even from each other.

not all carriers rely solely on their interceptor fleets however.
but, as the final dire avenger bled their last, the tyranids broke into dissaray, scattering to the four winds.
-every craftworld has an avatar and they can make more when they die.
in the centuries since, these primary command ships had departed the field of battle and become holy shrines, venerated by mystics and historians.
with a swift corkscrew spin, zoraya drove the vessel toward the center of the rock and stopped just above the surface.
although they excel in physical combat, high templar prefer to use psionic attacks that they have developed through intensive training.
- unless we are assuming they only use their ‘main weapon’ for purification.
@galorian and tau43 – iirc, entering or exiting the webway requires a webway gate – webway gates are usually found in the form of fixed structures and of varying sizes.
published on december 26, 2011, by admin - posted in group combat 506 suggested by sgcombine here’s a great match featuring the eldars from warhammer 40k matched up against theprotoss of starcraft.
nothing could survive the assault, human or otherwise.
-the two in my immediate memory are khaine who is the god behind the avatars of khaine, because he was shattered when he pissed off the king of the eldar gods(who is now dead, killed by the chaos gods).
zoraya accelerated into the asteroid field, swerving expertly to avoid numerous meteors and planetoids.
armed with a variety of weapons including the devastating fusion pistol and the vicious harlequins kiss.
the dimensions he used for the rounds are far shorter than the magazine implies.
