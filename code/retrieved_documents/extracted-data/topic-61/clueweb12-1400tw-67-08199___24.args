the biggest upset in my opinion is the joker loosing to the red skull.
surprise surprise… way too many star wars fans out there not to let it happen.
april 2nd, 2012 at 1:06 pm hank says: doom will find a way to come in at the end, and at the victor’s weakest point, he will take the infinity gauntlet from them.
i guess this means that movies are more popular than comics in the collectibles community.
to all x-men fans lets do what is right.
april 2nd, 2012 at 1:05 pm ricardo says: these battles are surprising me.
either way, it was close so wolvie went down swing… indie… wolvie… didn’t see that coming.
he ran away to dagobah cause he knew he couldn’t beat anakin, vader wins easy \m/ he ran away cause he couldnt beat palpatine, besides indiana jones would have been slaughtered by wolverine
vader did outlive yoda in the original trilogy… april 5th, 2012 at 10:39 am enshinnoi says: yoda because hayden ruined vader.
so zombies will just ignore him.
batman’s curiosity got the best of him.
march 25th, 2012 at 10:15 am joe g says: it has clearly become a popularity contest, but it is actually about who would survive longer in a zombie apocalypse, so it should neither be a battle between the two nor a popularity contest, if you actually read what the contest is about.
you could pit and ant against superman and have the ant win..it would make just as much sense as some of the results we are seeing here.
so now it’s up to the force to see how ridiculous this contest turns out batman.
i say this because no one is as powerful as an evil superman on the bad guys side, and as far as the good guys go han always shoots first.
it ain’t easy being green… march 21st, 2012 at 5:36 am dennis` says: batman will hope superman can still catch up march 20th, 2012 at 10:17 pm scott says: spidey should certainly win simply because he *always* wins, no matter how outclassed he may seem.
april 5th, 2012 at 10:16 am tomandshell says: yoda is a great character, but he failed to defeat both count dooku and palpatine before retreating and going into hiding.
now that the obvious has been established, gen.zod would do the *exact* same thing.
force power would turn his batarangs right around and plunge them into his face and chest!!!!
popularity contests are boring and vs battles have been done to death.

march 26th, 2012 at 9:28 pm trooper says: looks like boba fell to red skull.
ww loses her powers when tied up by a man (hey, don’t look at me, i don’t make the rules).
march 31st, 2012 at 4:51 pm philmc says: this poll is a sham of autobot voting as i voted for batman (who would never lose to jones) where batman was leading the vote at 50.45% & returned to the poll a second later and he was down to 48.48%.
indy would not last one second in an apocalyptic zombie infected world, he’s afraid of snakes.
yoda is a great character, but he failed to defeat both count dooku and palpatine before retreating and going into hiding.
march 26th, 2012 at 10:03 am granite says: the biggest upset in my opinion is the joker loosing to the red skull.
superman would beat the hulk.
the predator has laser projectiles and is invisible.
because guild 3rd stage navigators from arakis were seen arriving and leaving ss headquarters the whole time and now are nowhere to be found.
march 27th, 2012 at 2:04 pm ralphie says: lets face it this is not a heroes/villians super power contest..or all the remaining would have been eliminated already.
no way yoda should win this final battle.
of course, those are percentages so the tenths place could have pushed it over for indie.
therefore, yoda could beat vader.
old age and treachery will most always overcome youth and skill april 4th, 2012 at 7:01 pm trooper says: no daring, last minute rescues this time mr. jones.
the emperor seemed to have the upper hand, dooku fled.. to be saved the disgrace of being defeated..
march 28th, 2012 at 12:29 pm jay says: yes it looks to be a popularity contest, but it’s still fun to watch the outcomes.
sauron, optimus prime, superman, and wonder woman were very clear winners in their round one brackets.
of course, those are percentages so the tenths place could have pushed it over for indie.
surprise surprise… way too many star wars fans out there not to let it happen.
anything else is childish compared to these cybertronian giants can’t wait for this battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee tf power!!!!!!!
unfortunately yoda is the master so….
while zod is on earth no light saber,web,steel claws,batarang or whip can touch him.
either way, it was close so wolvie went down swing… indie… wolvie… didn’t see that coming.
the final battle seems pretty cut and dry.
indy would not last one second in an apocalyptic zombie infected world, he’s afraid of snakes.
hulk would have to reach mega po’ed levels to match superman’s power.
indy vs vader would be fun.
i absolutely cannot believe that he is winning that battle.
you could pit and ant against superman and have the ant win..it would make just as much sense as some of the results we are seeing here.
he ran away to dagobah cause he knew he couldn’t beat anakin, vader wins easy \m/ april 9th, 2012 at 7:12 pm ralphie says: yoda?truth is we all know this battle really took place in a universe far far away from the dc universe.
arakis were seen arriving and leaving ss headquarters the whole time and now are nowhere to be found.
the only possibility is for yoda to use the force to turn into satele shan.
he is a better teacher than fighter, but i’m voting for him anyway.
march 24th, 2012 at 10:23 am bigphatpaulie says: i’m happy to read that superman beat hulk.
indiana jones could survive this any day.
if anyone seriously believes that indiana jones can ever beat wonder woman, they are seriously seriously deluded.
obi-wan would kick batman’s a$$!!!!
april 2nd, 2012 at 12:49 pm gravitz says: it will probably end-up the way it should have ended, a long time ago in a galaxy far away.
ya gotta go… march 20th, 2012 at 12:12 pm elias najera says: joker will win march 20th, 2012 at 8:59 am aaron garcia says: all jedi rulea march 20th, 2012 at 8:49 am atomica.der says: the predator has laser projectiles and is invisible.
he looked into the light of the queen alien’s eyes and his head exploded while indy slipped out the back door.
indy caught him by surprise since he was dressed in a suit and they were just having dinner.
i say this because no one is as powerful as an evil superman on the bad guys side, and as far as the good guys go han always shoots first.
this poll is a sham of autobot voting as i voted for batman (who would never lose to jones) where batman was leading the vote at 50.45% & returned to the poll a second later and he was down to 48.48%.
it’s a fun popularity contest to go along w/ the ncaa tourney.

april 5th, 2012 at 4:56 pm daff says: yoda will banish vader – the dark side will not overcome april 5th, 2012 at 12:50 pm jedijones says: evil will always triumph because good is dumb!
yoda vs darth vader indy beats wonder woman, then beats wolverine and now is beating batman.
as much as i like maul i doubt his lightsaber can repel spells.
april 5th, 2012 at 11:23 am ghostwolf says: oh come on…vader is way way cooler compared to yoda.
march 23rd, 2012 at 8:31 am queso6p4 says: some of these winners don’t make any sense.
i absolutely cannot believe that he is winning that battle.
1st round was a wash, most the winners are ridiculous.
all indy would have to do is lasso her with his whip (as he does willie at the end of temple of doom) and she’s instantly helpless.
the hulk will smash the competition too bad magneto stayed home!
indy caught him by surprise since he was dressed in a suit and they were just having dinner.
if doomsday can beat/kill superman, i am sure the hulk can do that too!
and the accounting firm of price waterhouse/sideshow who tallied the secret votes must have been high on the spice melange’ the whole battle.
yoda vs darth vader march 31st, 2012 at 7:52 pm x-men says: indy beats wonder woman, then beats wolverine and now is beating batman.
that fight never made sense in the first place.

should have known it will be 2 star wars characters in the final.
for getting this far, he already deserves his last crusade pf april 2nd, 2012 at 2:12 pm josh-a-tron says: indy beating batman dropped my interest in this pretty low.

well what is happening here, is people vote their favorite hero/villain to win not taking in consideration that certain powers, outweigh others.. like obi wan would use the force on batman and thou i am a big batman fan, i fear the force would smack batman sideways.. and clearly not all voters look at it the same way… yeah… this isn’t about who could beat who in a fight.
eventually yoda is going to have to rest and be unable to keep suspending the hulk in mid-air, y’all.
ok, so i guess the conspiracy was to make sure that darth vader and yoda ended up in the finals.
it will probably end-up the way it should have ended, a long time ago in a galaxy far away.
indy actually could defeat wonder woman pretty easily.
old age and treachery will most always overcome youth and skill no daring, last minute rescues this time mr. jones.
it has clearly become a popularity contest, but it is actually about who would survive longer in a zombie apocalypse, so it should neither be a battle between the two nor a popularity contest, if you actually read what the contest is about.
april 2nd, 2012 at 1:53 pm kgix says: the final battle seems pretty cut and dry.
besides, ironman would lay the hurt on wolverine (wouldn’t even have the time to regenerate)
like, for example, indiana jones would be able to beat wolverine in a fight.
still think gandalf should’ve been in this \m/ april 3rd, 2012 at 9:16 am r e daffron says: yoda all the way april 3rd, 2012 at 8:58 am r2q5 says: indy found out who batman is and used the whip on him while dressed as bruce wayne.
indy vs wolverine now come on lets be real, wolverine would take care of him in less than a second.
anything else is childish compared to these cybertronian giants march 8th, 2012 at 4:25 pm autobot says: can’t wait for this battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee tf power!!!!!!!

so zombies will just ignore him.

march 23rd, 2012 at 1:12 am daron woodward says: it’s a great shame that there has been no small amount of deliberate ‘spoiling’ going on.

a strong pokemon would beat him… ha ha these results are completely ridiculous.
as much as i like maul i doubt his lightsaber can repel spells.
cart surviving the apocalypse requires more than good looks.
doom will find a way to come in at the end, and at the victor’s weakest point, he will take the infinity gauntlet from them.
even vader has living flesh.

ken benobi says: yoda trained luke, who had vader beat.
he ran away to dagobah cause he knew he couldn’t beat anakin, vader wins easy \m/ yoda?truth is we all know this battle really took place in a universe far far away from the dc universe.

march 29th, 2012 at 5:30 pm dustin rider says: look at the results for the wolverine vs indiana fight.
he’s faster and has tons more experience.
march 18th, 2012 at 11:55 am kevin says: indiana jones could survive this any day.
also why no gandalf? :/ boba fett is the best bounty hunter in the galaxy, absolutely win against the queen!
to all x-men fans lets do what is right.
some of these winners don’t make any sense.
march 24th, 2012 at 9:25 am cap_america says: it is unfortunate that some (probably more) view this and vote as if it were a popularity contest.
any normal human against a superhuman is going to lose, easy as, no matter how wiley or well tooled-up that human’s belt might be (and this from an mad batman fan), or handy with a whip they are.
probably faster due to the ruthless factor.
march 28th, 2012 at 11:20 am darth impulsive says: obi-wan would kick batman’s a$$!!!!
some awesome matchups predators going to own everyone sauron for the win, period the hulk!!!!
yes it looks to be a popularity contest, but it’s still fun to watch the outcomes.
besides, ironman would lay the hurt on wolverine (wouldn’t even have the time to regenerate)
sauron, optimus prime, superman, and wonder woman were very clear winners in their round one brackets.

oh come on…vader is way way cooler compared to yoda.

a strong pokemon would beat him… march 24th, 2012 at 12:41 pm eq says: ha ha these results are completely ridiculous.

i’m still astounded that joker got knocked out so early.
very well then, yoda vs vader it is… april 2nd, 2012 at 6:38 pm goblin king says: ok, so i guess the conspiracy was to make sure that darth vader and yoda ended up in the finals.

looks like boba fell to red skull.
and if he really pisses her off, he could always hide out in a lead-lined 1950s fridge (sorry, i really hated crystal skull…) hulk all the way !!!
boba fett is the best bounty hunter in the galaxy, absolutely win against the queen!

still think gandalf should’ve been in this \m/ yoda all the way indy found out who batman is and used the whip on him while dressed as bruce wayne.
palpatine tossed yoda around like a beach ball.
the new trilogy didn’t help out poor vader, conversely… vader did outlive yoda in the original trilogy… yoda because hayden ruined vader.
