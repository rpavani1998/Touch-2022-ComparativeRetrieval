as technology has finally caught up with the medium, it has allowed generations of fans to finally see our heroes on the screen as we imagined they would look like, act like, the massive destruction of these heroes and villains in front of our very eyes.if the avengers movie possesses even one of these compelling and fascinating characteristics, then the ongoing quest of all heroes has been more than fulfilled, and will continue to be incredibly inspiring.heroism in pop culture may have something interesting to contribute to self-examination and self-realisation; however, it has little positive effect on how to live as a participating, responsible individual in society.good superhero films combine the best elements of action, human identity, perceptions of morality, aspirational fantasty and humour.in our increasingly secular society, with so many disparate gods and different faiths, superhero films present a unique canvas upon which our shared hopes, dreams and apocalyptic nightmares can be projected and played out.this is damaging, because it acts as a kind of displacement or compensation for the real world, and nothing is done about the real world.i believe that's why so many of us are drawn towards superman, captain america, thor...and even those considered the villains in our divisional mindset of 'good vs evil' - brilliant characters such as loki, doc ock, lex, etc... from the comics and books to the silver screen, i think we are so fortunate to have such incredible characters come to life - who all, really, come from many shades of grey who have chosen their paths shaped by their interactions in life.but superhero films offer a shared, faithless, modern mythology, through which these truths can be explored.if anything, engaging with a mythology whose ideals we don't agree with is a great way of thinking about which values we believe are actually worthwhile.the villain often uses their brains to become stronger than the hero, or handicap the hero (eg kryptonite island in the superman reboot).this is where superhero stories are brilliant; they use themes and situations that have enthralled humanity for centuries, and then they twist them just so as to touch a certain cord, a nerve that could affect the way someone sees and confronts the world.a good superhero film (which the avengers is - i've seen it) is an exciting, immersive, moving experience and they - and the people involved in making them - should be celebrated.i think as much as popular culture has had a tangible influence on how we live our lives s as participating individuals, it has been to our detriment.no other superman can ever match up to him, and no other actor has ever conveyed the same hope as any other superhero.the possibility that there can be individuals who epitomize such polar extremes of character – virtues such as courage, honor, love even, as well as the incredibly illuminating traits of fear, anger, hopelessness, doubt – to the point of such rarity that they inspire art and literature in multiple forms… it’s ridiculously thrilling!
