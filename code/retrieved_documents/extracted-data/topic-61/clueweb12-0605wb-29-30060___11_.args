he has withstood temperatures equivalent of those found in the sun’s core, been hit with a nuclear bomb and survived planet-splitting impacts.his level of strength, endurance and healing ability is determined by his emotional state.it’s a victory for the man of steel, but in the process, hulk laid waste to metropolis and trashed the fortress of solitude, destroying many of superman’s personal items, historical kryptonian artifacts and his prized stamp collection.the two lock horns and create massive amounts of property damage.by taking a look at the caliber of their old rivals and their win/loss records, we can better determine who will come out on top.hulk could care less about the puny humans who get in his way but superman is determined to make sure there will be no collateral damage in this fight.while the hulk is just a big, strong monster, superman is faster than a speeding bullet and more powerful than a locomotive.the battle rages on but before it’s too late, superman manages to get inside the fortress of solitude and nail the hulk with the phantom zone projector, sending the gamma-spawned behemoth to that netherworld between worlds.absorbing man–crusher creel possesses the ability to take on the characteristics of whatever he touches: steel, rock, etc. he’s turned into stone and been smashed to pieces by the hulk more times than we can count.if superman is going to win this battle, he’s going to have to rely on brains over brawn, which shouldn’t be too hard, considering the hulk’s intelligence level is on par with the average 5-year old.superman’s got a few weaknesses, but since the hulk isn’t magical and he’s not likely carrying a chunk of kryptonite in those ripped-up purple pants, there’s really only one flaw left for him to exploit: superman’s heart.he could bore a hole into the earth at super speed and bury the hulk in it.he’s turned into stone and been smashed to pieces by the hulk more times than we can count.add to that the distraction of saving the lives of innocents caught in the midst of the battle and superman is gonna have his hands full.superman has a peak strength, the hulk doesn't...the madder hulk gets, the stronger he gets...so every time superman scored some pavement busting punches hulk would slowly be getting stronger...eventually he'd be a raging green behemoth...and as long as superman doesn't get to use his vast plethora of powers...in a knock-down, drag-out fight...
