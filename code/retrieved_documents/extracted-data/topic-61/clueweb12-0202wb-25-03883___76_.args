their formidable physiques are further enhanced by cybernetic implants and power suits.armed with their potent warp blades, the dark templar are deadly and relentless foes capable of devastating conventional forces.their crystals are both their computers and their power source, and are amazing in both respects.they are nigh unassailable, even imperial fleets are crushed against them, they are planet or even star sized in certain cases, and can easily drive by and bombard a planet to cinders with exotic weapons, including dark matter guns.their psychicness is much more offensively devastating, at least from what i’ve seen thus far.when the eldar fight with the avatar their can shrug off damage they normally wouldn’t, they are much faster, stronger and are almost as blood seeking as a berserker.these unified protoss spirits radiate incalculable power, unleashing psionic barrages against cowering enemy forces both in the air and on the ground.although they excel in physical combat, high templar prefer to use psionic attacks that they have developed through intensive training.the protoss also tend to suffer very few casualties in battle, as their suits automatically teleport them to the nearest medical facility upon critical injury or system failure.they also use holofields, which makes it nigh impossible to hit them unless you put out enough firepower to blanket the entire area of space they might occupy.it’s mantle like an egg and allowing oceans of magma to drown it’s surface and evicting it’s atmosphere with the force of the blasts.with careful guidance, high templar can learn to augment this effect, creating storms of raw psionic energy that can tear apart the minds of lesser species.”the protoss have such powerful psionic abilities that their presence inadvertently disrupts other life-forms.zealots use their substantial psionic abilities to create blades of pure energy that serve as their primary melee weapons.”craftworlds are between 10-100 km depending on their population (they grow and shrink based on the eb of psychic energy/souls).
