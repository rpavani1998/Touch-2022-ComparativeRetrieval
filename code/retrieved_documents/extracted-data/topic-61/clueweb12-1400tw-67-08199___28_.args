hulk would have to reach mega po’ed levels to match superman’s power.if doomsday can beat/kill superman, i am sure the hulk can do that too!force power would turn his batarangs right around and plunge them into his face and chest!!!!yoda is a great character, but he failed to defeat both count dooku and palpatine before retreating and going into hiding.doom will find a way to come in at the end, and at the victor’s weakest point, he will take the infinity gauntlet from them.march 24th, 2012 at 7:23 am antonio says: if doomsday can beat/kill superman, i am sure the hulk can do that too!like, for example, indiana jones would be able to beat wolverine in a fight.it ain’t easy being green… batman will hope superman can still catch up spidey should certainly win simply because he *always* wins, no matter how outclassed he may seem.to all x-men fans lets do what is right.hulk would have to reach mega po’ed levels to match superman’sit has clearly become a popularity contest, but it is actually about who would survive longer in a zombie apocalypse, so it should neither be a battle between the two nor a popularity contest, if you actually read what the contest is about.he’s faster and has tons more experience.the predator has laser projectiles and is invisible.all indy would have to do is lasso her with his whip (as he does willie at the end of temple of doom) and she’s instantly helpless.eventually yoda is going to have to rest and be unable to keep suspending the hulk in mid-air, y’all.
