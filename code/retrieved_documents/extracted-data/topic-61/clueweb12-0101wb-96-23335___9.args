imho, it's easier to write about human characters like batman or wolverine than about demigods like superman, gl, thor, or silver surfer.
as in the alan scott story about removing evil from earth, scott had no idea how to remove evil himself.
imo, the details don't matter, but brain activity is a electrochemical function, and therefore gl's ring should be able to affect it.
a message written soon after hal jordan "killed" kilowog and other green lanterns.
and psyches are subject to electrical stimulation, as in electro-shock therapy, which a gl ring could certainly duplicate.
so, since the ring can "do anything," how much more far-fetched is it for the ring to cure disease (by destroying microorganisms), wipe a mind (by rewiring brain cells), or eliminate someone's immortality (by eliminating whatever the immortality factor is in the subject's cells)?
as i said in another message, i would suggest limiting the power of the ring further to increase the dramatic possibilities of green lantern.
this would remove gl's ability to change matter directly and to generate various forms of energy (including telepathic waves).
besides, hal was clearly spaced out, demented, not in control of his faculties.
i think we could live without the 24-hour charge, as it only serves to give gl a chance to recite his oath dramatically.
i just don't think he works as a solo character.
he doesn't have the slightest idea what the full abilities of the mother box are, or brother eye, or the miracle machine.
saying the flash can run at mach 5 (or whatever) is a natural limitation to me.
as i said in another reply, i would cut down on the ring's main capability, rather than imposing artificial limitations.
sometimes they need to get weaker and more vulnerable (superman, batman/bruce wayne, flash/wally west, wolverine).
anytime the writer wants, he can say, "whoops, 24 hours are almost up.
the ring supplies the skills in many if not most cases.
or how about this: the green power has a corrupting element/influence that drives anyone who uses it insane.
for instance, hal jordan is a pragmatist and thinks in terms of things he can see and touch.
i just don't think he works as a solo character.
anytime the writer wants, he can say, "whoops, 24 hours are almost up.
if he needs the energy to knock out solomon grundy, and the story still has a ways to go, he doesn't have it.
hal doesn't have to lament the past, since he can recreate it.
no heat beams, magnetic beams, telepathic beams, etc. kilowog, who i believe was a physicist, would be just the opposite.
i, for one, am not going to burn my entire comic book collection in front of dc's headquarters.
for instance, if we limited hal jordan to creating physical objects only, he'd have to think of new and inventive ways to overcome problems all the time.
i don't see why not, since he's created spaceships that must be almost as complex.
***** first, on hal jordan's killing people.
that's my problem with characters like gl or thorthey're basically unlimited in power.
first, since the corps and rings are going through so many changes, i don't think you have to violate or ignore past stories.
"he may have the will to create the miracle machine and so forth, but the skill is another matter."
if they did agree, their answer would be wrong, since gl has created things when he didn't know how they worked.
and, of course, he could have contracted "green power ring disease," for all we know.
having to pop a pill, spin a dial, or jump back into the water doesn't strike me as analogous.
this turns the cell's interior into a different color (red) and then you use your power ring to bust out
if he could create a defibrillator, whose mechanics he probably doesn't understand, why not any other machine whose mechanics he doesn't understand as well?
comment (5/24/02): these correspondents need to get their stories straight.
in other words, our sun looks yellow to us because of the limited range of our vision.
therefore, there is no reason hal couldn't order a single person, if not the entire world, not to commit an evil act again ("evil" being as hal defined it).
the evidence seems pretty clear on that point.
copyrighted material is posted under the fair use provision of the copyright act, which allows copying for nonprofit educational uses including criticism and commentary.
no death is irreversible if a writer doesn't want it to be.
(life is a chemical process, after all, so if gl doesn't have to know the exact mechanics of it, he ought to be able to will it into existence.)
sometimes characters need to get stronger and nastier (guy gardner, hawkman, doc magnus, storm, hulk, invisible woman).
if someone dies and gl deems the person worthy enough, he brings the person back to life just as he did green arrow.
but couldnot create solid objects.
all biological and chemical processes involve matter and energy, and he can clearly manipulate both.
(but he could only tell which one had sent the message by the fact that the real hal's ring glowed while he sent it.
of course a good writer can think of clever variations on the time-limit problem, but i think you'd find, as time went by, that you'd use up your 24-hour-limit stories and start ignoring the device.
the mimic i would accept because employing his power required continuing strategy—stay in touch with one hero or switch to another.
***** >> did hal really create kryptonite radiation with his ring.
<< if that were true, then the guardians would simply use that limitless power to accomplish whatever ultimate purpose they had in mind, without use of a "corps.
i'd like to see something that a few gl writers have hinted atnamely, that each ring acts according to the philosophy/world view of the bearer.
it doesn't matter whether he knows how to do this or tells the ring to produce the final result, since the task violates the laws of physics.
this would remove gl's ability to change matter directly and to generate various forms of energy (including telepathic waves).
i wish the ring were limited in power, as it would make for more dramatic stories.
that's certainly possible, but it's also possible that hal jordan invented the strategm, that (if some writer says so) the ring can do it just because hal wills it.
i think it's because gl is a tough character to make interesting and appealing.
(if nothing else, gl could order his ring to scan mister miracle's mother box and create a duplicate of it.)
yet gl can shrink himself even though he can't know the unknowable mechanics of shrinking.
he doesn't "know" any of this; he thinks "car" or "force field" and the ring supplies the knowledge, the energy, and the mechanics.
that's my problem with characters like gl or thor—they're basically unlimited in power.
the guardians have claimed in the past that they know the future of the universe, that everything is part of their master plan.
dang, i must have read all the bad iron man and thor stories and missed all the good ones.
comment (5/24/02): kevin smith's recent green arrow only cements the point.
the ring can do anything the wearer (and writer) imagines.
gl knows what a defibrillator does, even if he doesn't understand the process by which it does it: it sends an electric shock to the heart muscle.
at best hal is doing what kyle supposedly does: visualizing the result and letting the ring figure out how to do it.
we can visualize ourselves shrinking, teleporting across the galaxy, or traveling through time.
it could cause a fire by rubbing two sticks together, but not by generating heat directly.
a good lawyer could easily get him acquitted on the grounds of temporary insanity.
or how about this: the green power has a corrupting element/influence that drives anyone who uses it insane.
the guardians have told him when to jump, and he's asked how high.
he might be able to duplicate any function or set of functions he has seen them perform, but not duplicate the entire range of functions.
i liken the ring to a computer because it performs certain functions automatically or upon orders but doesn't think independently.
in other words, a stronger character would have rebelled long ago.
i would go with this and limit himonly to creating solid objects.
the mimic i would accept because employing his power required continuing strategystay in touch with one hero or switch to another.
gl could travel through space by creating a space vehicle, but not by willing himself to go faster than light.
he wouldn't have to know how it worked, according to you, just what the result was.
as i recall, the occasion was the destruction of coast city, hal jordan's subsequent killing spree, and the introduction of kyle rayner.
(if nothing else, gl could order his ring to scan mister miracle's mother box and create a duplicate of it.)
he simply "wishes" for a result and the ring does it without hal's having the slightest clue how.
having to pop a pill, spin a dial, or jump back into the water doesn't strike me as analogous.
as for kilowog, that does seem inexcusable and unnecessary.
same with supermanwith his super-speed, he could put almost any villain out of commission before the bad guy could blink.
upshot: gl doesn't have to know how a defibrillator, a mother box, or a time machine works.
doctorshave cured someone (perhaps accidentally) of violent tendencies by removing part of the brain.
unless, of course, he hasin the pastasked the ring to analyze and store the inner workings of such devices, and then asks the ring to duplicate them in toto.
the ring defined it by removing the entire person, implying they were evil through and through.
as i said, the character has always been too inherently powerful his own good, imho.
yet gl can shrink himself even though he can't know the unknowable mechanics of shrinking.
in contrast, the 24-hour limit imposes thesame storytelling problem every time: he's got to run away and recharge.
i suggested this dodged the issue and a clever gl really could eliminate evil.
the lack of definition is a big reason why gl has never succeeded as a character.
we might also leave the ring the ability to "think" independently, so it could supply information or translate speech.
***** another correspondent tries again to explain gl's ring.
i don't see why not, since he's created spaceships that must be almost as complex.
in contrast, the 24-hour limit imposes thesame storytelling problem every time: he's got to run away and recharge.
in this case, the ring could create a protective bubble, but not a magnetic field.
gl could travel through space by creating a space vehicle, but not by willing himself to go faster than light.
i don't expect a ring to literally excise every "evil cell" and leave every "good cell" intact.
once this impurity is removed, everyone's healthy again and no one is blamed for his actions "under the influence.
he could alter everyone's brains and make them happy (or at least not mentally disturbed), teleport any opponent into a jail cell, etc.
the point is that anything in comic books, including death and more, can be reversed, so i wouldn't worrytoo much.
but i won't blame dc for trying something radical, only for doing it in an apparently tactless or unfair (to gerald jones) way.
same reason i think ultra boy is a "good" superhero—his power requires thought and planning to be used to best effect.
first, on hal jordan's killing people.
first, since the corps and rings are going through so many changes, i don't think you have to violate or ignore past stories.
he walked in and saw them and then got a telepathic message from the real hal.
there is no reason he couldn't create food for everyone or eradicate all disease.
no death is irreversible if a writer doesn't want it to be.
only i would make that a limitation, theonly thing the ring could do.
if that's not sufficient, the ring excises whichever brain cells and chemicals that create the thoughts and feelings that alan scott deems "evil."
no heat beams, magnetic beams, telepathic beams, etc. kilowog, who i believe was a physicist, would be just the opposite.
interestingly, supes determined that gl's kryptonite radiation was "artificial," and thus could be blocked by his yellow "s" emblem.
a correspondent suggested gl has to know exactly what he's doing before he does it.
i don't mind a character who grows weaker after using his power, but i think the minute or hour cutoffs are poor.
those comic-book gimmicks i don't mind those limitations either, but i have a vague sense that they've never really worked well.
i'm sure he's willed up planes, cars, skyscrapers, bulldozers, blast furnaces, and acetylane torches, none of which he presumably knows how to construct.
we all agree gl can create a modern-day machine: a car, a jet, or a television.
(life is a chemical process, after all, so if gl doesn't have to know the exact mechanics of it, he ought to be able to will it into existence.)
the alan scott story failed to address the issue in any meaningful way.
it could cause a fire by rubbing two sticks together, but not by generating heat directly.
" when the same guy can beat mongul and lose to deathstroke the terminator, something's wrong, imho.
just to be contrary, i must say that green lantern has never struck me as the most exciting or meaningful book in the past.
of course not...yet the power-ring elephants behave just like actual elephants.
he's been ordered to ignore personal responsibilities to attend to crises.
an evil magician was blackmailing superman into doing his bidding, and summoned gl and flash for "sport."
in fact, the human psycheis subject to mechanical means; surgeons sometimes remove part of the brain and alter a person's personality, which a gl ring could do also.
to create a copy of an energy effect, you have to know how the energy works (within reason—heat and light are somewhat simple, and are probably understood by the ring).
as in the alan scott story about removing evil from earth, scott had no idea how to remove evil himself.
at best kyle is imagining (not visualizing) a result and letting the ring figure out how to do it.
upshot: gl doesn't have to know how a defibrillator, a mother box, or a time machine works.
the ring defined it by removing the entire person, implying they were evil through and through.
he's been ordered to ignore personal responsibilities to attend to crises.
he doesn't have the skill to do most of the things he does, unless you contend that hal has advanced degrees in physics, engineering, geology, architecture, munitions, navigation, etc.
but, again, if gl doesn't have to know the methodology, just the result, it would be up to the ring to manage the intricacies.
someone asks exactly how gl would remove evil.
i think it's because these series inevitably favor plot and action over characterization.
so to create a ring-powered machine to destroy evil, you have to know how to destroy evil.
simply say that gl has wasted or leaked some of the green energy away, and the rings will no longer do what they could before.
for instance, hal jordan is a pragmatist and thinks in terms of things he can see and touch.
limited heroes = good idea someone suggests many iron man and thor stories didn't overuse the characters' physical limitations.
and we know it can, because he's made people forget unpleasant things many times.
the guardians of the galaxy are an inhibiting and almost unworkable concept: if they exist, gl should spend 99% of his time patrolling his sector, and the gl corps should intervene every time mongul, the dominators, the missile men, or whoever invades the earth.
but i imagine a ring could affect those parts of the brain that cause sad, negative, or violent thoughts and dampen them enough so a person would become functional.
" when the same guy can beat mongul and lose to deathstroke the terminator, something's wrong, imho.
i saved some of my correspondents' messages, but not all of them.
as i said, the character has always been too inherently powerful his own good, imho.
i don't believe that clark kent, hal jordan, steve rogers, or peter parkeri.e., any true herowould go off the deep end for any reason.
green lantern literally can be a god if he musters enough willpower.
so, since the ring can "do anything," how much more far-fetched is it for the ring to cure disease (by destroying microorganisms), wipe a mind (by rewiring brain cells), or eliminate someone's immortality (by eliminating whatever the immortality factor is in the subject's cells)?
since light couldn't penetrate there, the ring was useless, but she made it into a green bell that emitted sound waves rather than light.
we all agree gl can create a modern-day machine: a car, a jet, or a television.
really, in addition to covering any yellow object with dust motes, gl can either darken a room or place a green filter between the light source and the yellow object.
just to be contrary, i must say that green lantern has never struck me as the most exciting or meaningful book in the past.
in brightest day, in blackest night, no gl shall escape my sight.
the guardians have acted confused before, only to claim later that it was part of the plan.
he communicates with the ring and with other races telepathically, so mind control seems eminently possible.
but couldnot create solid objects.
as i recall, the occasion was the destruction of coast city, hal jordan's subsequent killing spree, and the introduction of kyle rayner.
we might also leave the ring the ability to "think" independently, so it could supply information or translate speech.
physicists are at least talking about wormholes and time travel being theoretically possible, which makes them more possible than shrinking.
same with superman—with his super-speed, he could put almost any villain out of commission before the bad guy could blink.
all biological and chemical processes involve matter and energy, and he can clearly manipulate both.
sometimes they need to get weaker and more vulnerable (superman, batman/bruce wayne, flash/wally west, wolverine).
it would work best with about 12 gls, each with a different approach.
saying he couldn't run on yellow brick roads would be arbitrary.
i just don't think the arbitrary limitations work as well as what i'd call "organic" or "natural" limitations.
to create the illusion of a working car, fan, or something that just moves, you make a copy and move it.
i wish the ring were limited in power, as it would make for more dramatic stories.
it doesn't matter whether he knows how to do this or tells the ring to produce the final result, since the task violates the laws of physics.
if the answer is he's visualizing the planet as a whole, not as a gazillion components...well, that applies to creating objects like motorcycles and blowtorches too.
i'd say gl really needs the humanizing influence of green arrow, john stewart, guy gardner, the rest of the corps, or even itty.
gl wouldn't have to think about it on a conscious level.
but then, i've never seen my city destroyed, so that's a bit beyond my comprehension, too.
to create the illusion of a working car, fan, or something that just moves, you make a copy and move it.
surgery will take care of boodikka just fine.
i suggest that a character should be compromised by his own fear and ignorance, not by some plot device.
since light couldn't penetrate there, the ring was useless, but she made it into a green bell that emitted sound waves rather than light.
the guardians have acted confused before, only to claim later that it was part of the plan.
if he needs the energy to keep a planet from blowing up, he's got it.
"he may have the will to create the miracle machine and so forth, but the skill is another matter."
in other words, a stronger character would have rebelled long ago.
you give the ring a goal; it figures out how to do it.
you give the ring a goal; it figures out how to do it.
i don't believe that clark kent, hal jordan, steve rogers, or peter parker—i.e., any true hero—would go off the deep end for any reason.
if he doesn't have to know how a planet "works" to keep it from blowing up, he doesn't have to know how a motorcycle works to create one.
i'd argue that dc's flash, gl, hawkman, atom, aquaman, and quite a few other characters sucked and were in need of surgery.
gl also has done things that are flatly impossible, such as shrinking himself to subatomic size.
the point is that anything in comic books, including death and more, can be reversed, so i wouldn't worrytoo much.
these actionsmay affect the person's skills and memories or they may not.
gl wouldn't have to think about it on a conscious level.
the brain doesn't function like that.
whereas if a character, especially a team character, grows weak, it allows other characters to move to the fore.
or simply put a better writer on the job.
and he can also say, "all gl can do is hammers, tongs, and flyswatters.
they already partnered gl with a mere mortal, gave his ring to someone else, destroyed and rebuilt the gl corps, etc.
a better solution might've been for the ring to explode or implodebecause the definition of "evil" was so paradoxical the ring couldn't handle it.

it doesn't exactly drive me up a tree, but i think it weakens the character.
writers have to "dumb down" his stories and put artificial limitations on his intelligence and abilities, just as they did with the pre-crisis superman.
if something isn't clear, i've tried to annotate it to make it clearer.
his ring could create or negate heat, magnetism, gravity, etc.
that's okay by me, but i doubt dc will let itself be bound by the hobgoblin of consistency.
hal jordan, for instance, has no physical or mental idea of how to accomplish the above tasks.
thats the only time i can recall hal using telepathy.
simply say that gl has wasted or leaked some of the green energy away, and the rings will no longer do what they could before.
again someone thinks gl needs precise knowledge of what he's doing.
power ring facts here are some things a green lantern can do with his power ring.
***** someone makes a good point.
chris claremont did great things with characters whose powers initially "wore out," giving them training

no good answer is possible, but i'd love to hear someone try.
a gl who was a poet, otoh, wouldn't be able to do either of these things; instead she could create abstract patterns of green light that could alter one's emotions, perceptions, and thought processes.

green lantern/parallax either brought green arrow back to life or created a new green arrow, depending how you look at it.
let's say that the ring should only be able to create solid objects—i.e., shapes that have physical substance, hardness, density, or whatever.
of course not...yet the power-ring elephants behave just like actual elephants.
there isn't an "evil" cortex ala doc savage; you can't remove a specific ganglia and leave the person alive with skills and memory intact, but the personality altered so that he'll never look at the woman next door with lust in his heart again.
he shrank himself to atomic size and slipped between the molecules of a gold casing once.
knowledge of how to do something obviously isn't necessary, unless hal jordan has taken classes in celestial navigation, warp creation, or faster-than-light travel.
and we know it can, because he's made people forget unpleasant things many times.
a message written soon after hal jordan "killed" kilowog and other green lanterns.
if a being with a much wider range of vision looked at it (or for safety's sake a picture of it ) it might see it as *&%*&% (whatever word it uses for ultraviolet).

and note that gl can also travel at super-speed, though no one ever employs that aspect of his power.
if one favors capitol punishment, one could argue that sinestro deserved it.

comment (5/24/02):  these correspondents need to get their stories straight.
the power ring and lantern is limitless power.
there was a real character, with pain, blood, and flaws, dealing with cardboard cutouts.
if someone dies and gl deems the person worthy enough, he brings the person back to life just as he did green arrow.
physicists are at least talking about wormholes and time travel being theoretically possible, which makes them more possible than shrinking.
if a ring can create a space warp or telepathic waves, it can create anything he can imagine.

all of the hal's got arrested and taken to the police building where barry allen worked.
knowledge of how to do something obviously isn't necessary, unless hal jordan has taken classes in celestial navigation, warp creation, or faster-than-light travel.
in this case, the ring could create a protective bubble, but not a magnetic field.

doctors treat depression by directing chemicals to a particular part of the brain.

in one flash/green lantern story they had someone make some duplicates of hal, who then attacked him.

i still wouldn't count kilowog out.
besides, hal was clearly spaced out, demented, not in control of his faculties.

don't ask when, but i suspect batman, green arrow, hawkman, wonder woman, and other dc heroes have killed before, if only by letting people die through inaction.
i'm sure he's willed up planes, cars, skyscrapers, bulldozers, blast furnaces, and acetylane torches, none of which he presumably knows how to construct.
i would go with this and limit himonly to creating solid objects.
gl knows what a defibrillator does, even if he doesn't understand the process by which it does it: it sends an electric shock to the heart muscle.

it's also subject to chemical manipulation (drugs), which is not beyond the power of gl's ring.
since the green energy can't pass through the yellow walls, i'd doubt his energy-imbued/altered molecules could, either.
teleportation would require alteration of his molecules in some way by the green energy of the ring, probably investing them with some of it.

don't ask when, but i suspect batman, green arrow, hawkman, wonder woman, and other dc heroes have killed before, if only by letting people die through inaction.
if that's not sufficient, the ring excises whichever brain cells and chemicals that create the thoughts and feelings that alan scott deems "evil."
so he couldn't just alter people's thought processes.
seeing how each gl solved a problem would become a fascinating exercise rather than a predictable bore.
in fact, the human psycheis subject to mechanical means; surgeons sometimes remove part of the brain and alter a person's personality, which a gl ring could do also.
but i imagine a ring could affect those parts of the brain that cause sad, negative, or violent thoughts and dampen them enough so a person would become functional.
> gl's limited approach to eradicating evil doesn't show how limited *comic books* are.
surgery will take care of boodikka just fine.
i don't think there's any reason he couldn't bring someone back to life or will himself to be immortal, either.
or simply put a better writer on the job.
he might be able to duplicate any function or set of functions he has seen them perform, but not duplicate the entire range of functions.
i suggested this dodged the issue and a clever gl really could eliminate evil.
i enjoyed the stories where englehart et al. destroyed and then rebuilt the gl corps.
for instance, if we limited hal jordan to creating physical objects only, he'd have to think of new and inventive ways to overcome problems all the time.
good comment about "yellow pigment."
chris claremont did great things with characters whose powers initially "wore out," giving them training so they gradaully and realistically extended the scope of their abilities.
limited heroes = good idea someone suggests many iron man and thor stories didn't overuse the characters' physical limitations.
he can: read someone's mind; have his ring search a city for someone he has only a (mental) picture of; make his body nebulous enough for solid objects to pass through; shrink himself; transmit matter into other matter (his clothes, for instance) or create matter out of thin air; control people's minds and tell them what to do; trace gravity and other energy waves to their source; distinguish a single person's footsteps from all other vibrations; emit kryptonite rays; stop a world's core from blowing up.
his ring could create or negate heat, magnetism, gravity, etc.
if a ring can create a space warp or telepathic waves, it can create anything he can imagine.
the guardians have told him when to jump, and he's asked how high.
he communicates with the ring and with other races telepathically, so mind control seems eminently possible.
seeing how each gl solved a problem would become a fascinating exercise rather than a predictable bore.
once this impurity is removed, everyone's healthy again and no one is blamed for his actions "under the influence.
green lantern/parallax either brought green arrow back to life or created a new green arrow, depending how you look at it.
sometimes characters need to get stronger and nastier (guy gardner, hawkman, doc magnus, storm, hulk, invisible woman).
***** as i said in another reply, i would cut down on the ring's main capability, rather than imposing artificial limitations.
you never know whether he'll take charge in any situation or "forget" all the wonderful tricks he can do and thus get himself hurt or captured.
perhaps this is, tooespecially since it seems established that a gl corps will exist sometime in the future.
so to create a ring-powered machine to destroy evil, you have to know how to destroy evil.
the ring interpreted the command and executed the wish, removing all the people from earth.
and psyches are subject to electrical stimulation, as in electro-shock therapy, which a gl ring could certainly duplicate.
he wouldn't have to know how it worked, according to you, just what the result was.
given this, i submit that gl can do literally anything he wants if he has enough will power.
so he couldn't just alter people's thought processes.
if he could create a defibrillator, whose mechanics he probably doesn't understand, why not any other machine whose mechanics he doesn't understand as well?
anyway, a temporary insanity plea will cure this phase.
saying he couldn't run on yellow brick roads would be arbitrary.
he's created animals such as elephants and lions, as well as energy duplicates of himself, for example.
if one favors capitol punishment, one could argue that sinestro deserved it.
he doesn't "know" any of this; he thinks "car" or "force field" and the ring supplies the knowledge, the energy, and the mechanics.
when the reader can outthink the hero, come up with better solutions, it interrupts the suspension of belief.
doctors treat depression by directing chemicals to a particular part of the brain.
i don't expect a ring to literally excise every "evil cell" and leave every "good cell" intact.
only i would make that a limitation, theonly thing the ring could do.
as i said in another message, i would suggest limiting the power of the ring further to increase the dramatic possibilities of green lantern.
same reason i think ultra boy is a "good" superherohis power requires thought and planning to be used to best effect.
and, of course, he could have contracted "green power ring disease," for all we know.
he's created animals such as elephants and lions, as well as energy duplicates of himself, for example.
" comment (5/24/02): gl's power is limitless when it serves the story, limited otherwise.
so they gradaully and realistically extended the scope of their abilities.
it's also subject to chemical manipulation (drugs), which is not beyond the power of gl's ring.
