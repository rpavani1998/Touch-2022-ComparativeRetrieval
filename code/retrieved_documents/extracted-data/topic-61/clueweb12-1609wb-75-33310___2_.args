the hulk is rage personified - he burns out, confused, returns to earth, and is never quite in control of himself.mountainous in stature and covered in hard, orange rock, ben grimm, manhattan native, can punch his way through steel just as easily as his contemporaries: 'the hulk', juggernaut, hercules or superman.at any rate, throughout the history of comics, no strong man has a stronger heart than the fantastic four's ben grimm a.k.a 'the thing'.he feels like a monster that, unlike the hulk, can never change back.only the thing really suffers, and out of this suffering is born his greatest strengths, like the boxer that is outclassed from the first bell but fights valiantly and hopelessly all the way to the twelfth - which the thing has done time and time again, against hulk, against juggernaut, against himself.only a romance with blind sculptress alicia masters helps him break through this feeling of ugliness and otherness.the thing falls into that category of superhero known to many as "the brick," the hard, muscle-bound guy (or gal) that keeps their feet on the ground punching out robot-tanks and such while his cohorts - "the brain," "the blaster," etc. - swirl, swoop and fly around him.what makes the thing such an enduring character is his appeal to the common people.certainly, the stocky sidekick archetype is ben grimm to a t. as part of the fantastic four, ben's job is to run back up or absorb blows for reed richards, the elastic mr. fantastic (the brain); johnny storm, the human torch (the blaster); and sue storm/richards, invisible girl (a kind of handy but by no means underestimated accessory and den mother).some bricks are stronger and some more eloquent; certainly many are more powerful, more popular.the sensitive heart that beats within the orange chest - a heart that is not unlike our own in that it feels deeply the wounds of a society that actively seeks to ostracize the different or the "unattractive" - is what gives the thing his cathartic appeal.all material on fandmolife.net is either copyright of fandomlife.net, the invididual authors or someone else, so don't copy or use the material without permission.it is his humanity that pushes ben further than the other traditional bricks.the x-men's colossus is eloquent, shiny, malleable, and a chrome adonis.in fact, he took center-stage shortly after the fantastic four launched in the early 60s, overtaking johnny as the fan favorite and eventually earning his own series.
