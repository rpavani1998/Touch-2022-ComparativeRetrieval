he could alter everyone's brains and make them happy (or at least not mentally disturbed), teleport any opponent into a jail cell, etc.his ring could create or negate heat, magnetism, gravity, etc.this would remove gl's ability to change matter directly and to generate various forms of energy (including telepathic waves).all biological and chemical processes involve matter and energy, and he can clearly manipulate both.writers have to "dumb down" his stories and put artificial limitations on his intelligence and abilities, just as they did with the pre-crisis superman.he can: read someone's mind; have his ring search a city for someone he has only a (mental) picture of; make his body nebulous enough for solid objects to pass through; shrink himself; transmit matter into other matter (his clothes, for instance) or create matter out of thin air; control people's minds and tell them what to do; trace gravity and other energy waves to their source; distinguish a single person's footsteps from all other vibrations; emit kryptonite rays; stop a world's core from blowing up.chris claremont did great things with characters whose powers initially "wore out," giving them training so they gradaully and realistically extended the scope of their abilities.sometimes characters need to get stronger and nastier (guy gardner, hawkman, doc magnus, storm, hulk, invisible woman).green lantern literally can be a god if he musters enough willpower.the guardians of the galaxy are an inhibiting and almost unworkable concept: if they exist, gl should spend 99% of his time patrolling his sector, and the gl corps should intervene every time mongul, the dominators, the missile men, or whoever invades the earth.he communicates with the ring and with other races telepathically, so mind control seems eminently possible.so, since the ring can "do anything," how much more far-fetched is it for the ring to cure disease (by destroying microorganisms), wipe a mind (by rewiring brain cells), or eliminate someone's immortality (by eliminating whatever the immortality factor is in the subject's cells)?sometimes they need to get weaker and more vulnerable (superman, batman/bruce wayne, flash/wally west, wolverine).don't ask when, but i suspect batman, green arrow, hawkman, wonder woman, and other dc heroes have killed before, if only by letting people die through inaction.it's also subject to chemical manipulation (drugs), which is not beyond the power of gl's ring.
