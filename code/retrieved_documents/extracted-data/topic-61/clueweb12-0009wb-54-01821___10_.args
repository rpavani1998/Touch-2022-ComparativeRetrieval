we're using the leeway the all-star concept gives us to take the best elements from every era of superman and use them to build a whole new world and direction for the character.all-star: the concept behind all-stars is to get the hottest, fan-friendliest writers and artists to do their interpretations of classic dc characters in their classic scenarios, free of the restraints of current post-crisis continuities.his solar cells become super charged by an overdose of solar radiation.he's never managed to get rid of superman because deep down he knows that when he does, he'll be forced to prove himself to the world...and be found wanting.he always finds a way to solve every single problem without anyone being hurt.luthor is the part of us that's the most evil, the most human, and the most brilliant.this is the subconscious engine that drives his hatred of his nemesis.there is a fatal chain reaction in his cell structure and his cells begin to self-destruct.grant morrison writes: all-star is not about continuityâ€”it's about about telling new stories for a very different audience we've got now because they're reading manga and adults are looking at superhero movies.overall, the series is more about superman's relationships with his friends and with the world than anything else.a man like superman would never have to tense against the cold; never have to flinch in the face of a blow.my comics tend to be inspired by whatever's going on in my life and in the world at the time and superman is no exception.every time he knocks something over he's doing it to save somebody.clark kent winds up sharing a prison cell with lex luthor in issue #5.the rest of superman's rogues gallery is pretty weak, so i've tried to add some characters i think might enhance the mix.
