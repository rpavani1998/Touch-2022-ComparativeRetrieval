apr 24, 2009 this is a message i am sending out to all the dbz fans i can find on deviantart, i have made a poster containing over 50+ characters and i want to present it to you.
this way, when anyone visits a deviant, they know they can always find the art in the top left, and personal info in the top right.
- you can drag and drop to rearrange.
