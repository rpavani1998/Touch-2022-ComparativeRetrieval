superman has more varied powers and because he's smarter can be more resourceful in using them.superman does have tremendous skill in combat and wouldn't have defeated extremely skilled opponents like mongrel,doomsday,and general zod if he wasn't.despite this whole thing being in the universe of make believe,given what we know of these two titans there's no way in hell that a gamma-ray mutation but still mortal hulk could even come close to taking a super advanced,near god-like,alien being like superman.even if hulk retained banner's great intellect,he would still lose because superman is still way smarter and stronger.superman/kal-el is not only the son of jor-el,krypton's most brilliant scientist,but he's outsmarted lex luthor(one of the smartest people on earth)andsuperman is also way the hell faster and would be able to easily dodge the strikes of hulk.speaking of intelligence,how the hell can anyone think that superman isn't smarter than a human,even one as brilliant as dr.bruce banner.if the abomination can knock out hulk then superman certainly could and in less time!there is a limit to how angry someone gets...even the hulk and even at his angriest he wouldn't be as strong as superman.he has the knowlege the kryptonian people and that includes their advanced combat techniques.many wrongly think that just because hulk is bigger and looks stronger than it means he is stronger.i agree with goldeneyez and lancedenier among others,superman would win and it wouldn't be nearly as close as many would think.though obviously there is a loss of income for those who have decided that movie theaters have become more annoying than rewarding due to moronic individuals who only think of themselves and distract you from the movie experience and therefore they wait for the dvd.others believe hulk would win because they're likely marvel fan boys.yes i think he's smarter than banner.
