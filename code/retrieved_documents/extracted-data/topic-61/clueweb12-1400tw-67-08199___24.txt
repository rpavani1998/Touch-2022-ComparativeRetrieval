the biggest upset in my opinion is the joker loosing to the red skull.
i love batman but come on, seriously!!!
to  which he retorts, “nothing?
i know who i’m hoping for.
surprise surprise… way  too many star wars fans out there not to let it happen.
april 2nd, 2012 at 1:06 pm hank says: doom will find a way to come in at the end, and at the victor’s  weakest point, he will take the infinity gauntlet from them.
lets do what is right.
freddy krueger cut them all!
it was vader vs yoda all along.
the vote was not limpid..i am not going to deal again..
– joey april 2nd, 2012 at 3:25 pm choopie says: go indy!
march 18th, 2012 at 4:30 pm tobias says: wow some awesome matchups march 18th, 2012 at 3:11 pm awesoness says:
yeah i love indy and logan both.
but vader is just the underling of the  emperor, and we all know that vader has a weakness for good..
anyway, is it allowed to bring kryptonite to the match?
i’m really hoping he wins this can i vote for galactus?
that’s like  hearing mit romney say “barrack o’bama will win.”
i still have no idea who general zod is? @
it is abslutely preposterous!
i guess this means that movies are more popular than comics in the collectibles community.
i guess it went by some computer program weighting system?
to all x-men fans lets do what is right.
april 2nd, 2012 at 1:05 pm ricardo says: these battles are surprising me.
march 22nd, 2012 at 5:55 pm autobot says: optimus prime defeated from spidey?
jason would slaughter them all, and he’s not even in the competition!
deadpool said it best in response to cain marko’s classic line, “nothing stops the juggernaut!” to which he retorts, “nothing?
i think we have winner march 20th, 2012 at 8:22 am lopie says: that was fun march 20th, 2012 at 6:40 am gary lam says: i like ironman march 20th, 2012 at 6:38 am gary lam says: ironman win march 20th, 2012 at 2:38 am alpini says: yeah, where is mort?!?
either way, it was close so wolvie went down swing… indie… wolvie… didn’t see that coming.
:/ march 19th, 2012 at 1:21 am andrea says:
least vader has a similar color scheme april 6th, 2012 at 2:46 am eric says: yes..
he ran away to dagobah cause he knew he  couldn’t beat anakin, vader wins easy \m/ he ran away cause he couldnt beat palpatine, besides indiana jones would  have been slaughtered by wolverine
is a freaking  nightmare how darth vader can beat him!
batman is quite capable march 23rd, 2012 at 12:27 pm theone says: glad chuck norris was not considered for these battles… march 23rd, 2012 at 9:00 am x-men says: how can indy beat wonder woman and now be winning against wolverine?
indy won match with batman?
red skull just busted out the cosmic cube!
april 5th, 2012 at 12:05 pm kixxo says: vader is going down.
i love batman but come on,  seriously!!!
okay i think it will come down to general zod vs han solo.
impossible… i the end it will be like the picture.
ya gotta go… joker will win all jedi rulea
the real heavy metal  fight by faaaaaaaar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
vader is your worst nightmare….. darth vader vs yoda april 2nd, 2012 at 2:20 pm halcyon says: go indy..
vader did outlive yoda in the original trilogy… april 5th, 2012 at 10:39 am enshinnoi says: yoda because hayden ruined vader.

and he still won haha!
fall march 22nd, 2012 at 3:16 pm apone says: this is already screwy..
indiana jones climbing these rankings is ridiculous.
march 15th, 2012 at 6:30 pm jason says:
so zombies will just ignore him.
batman’s curiosity got the best of him.
like a cows opinion…it doesn’t  matter; it’s moo.”
march 25th, 2012 at 10:15 am joe g says: it has clearly become a popularity contest, but it is actually about who  would survive longer in a zombie apocalypse, so it should neither be a battle  between the two nor a popularity contest, if you actually read what the contest  is about.
april 6th, 2012 at 6:28 am ben says: should have been batman all the way.
who would win  in a fight against each other?
april 3rd, 2012 at 7:21 am erik peña says: vader vs yoda yyyeeeeaahhhh april 3rd, 2012 at 1:15 am don howard says: well would have loved to see this on the big screen april 2nd, 2012 at 11:40 pm legolas says: come now, really?
you could pit and ant against superman and have the ant win..it would make  just as much sense as some of the results we are seeing here.
march 22nd, 2012 at 1:16 pm scott says: how indy beat wonder woman to begin with is ridiculous enough, but  wolverine?!
exactly how are we supposed to judge this then?
that is ridiculous march 28th, 2012 at 12:15 pm granite says: i know who i’m hoping for.
march 19th, 2012 at 12:25 pm wadd says: lecter can’t bloody well eat the t1000 that psycho shrink is dooomed  !!
who drew up these  brackets?
and now everybody at sideshow’s eyes have a blue tinge.
look at the results for the wolverine vs indiana fight.
april 4th, 2012 at 9:13 am ghostwolf says: is indy really catching up to yoda right now…? april 4th, 2012 at 3:17 am bigbunny says: vader for the win!
nice bracket game april 5th, 2012 at 11:09 am gravitz says: the new trilogy didn’t help out poor vader, conversely… april 5th, 2012 at 11:03 am tony provenzano says:
march 15th, 2012 at 5:51 pm awesome boy says: superman could only be destroyed by one thing only,and no one in this  battle haves or knows superman’s weakness,except for batman-yeah  boyyyyy march 15th, 2012 at 3:45 pm ken benobi says: darth vader says “yoda will win”?!?!?!
what criteria are we supposed to use?
impossible… april 1st, 2012 at 9:00 am darth vader says: i the end it will be like the picture.
so now it’s up to the force to see how ridiculous this contest turns out batman.
should have been batman all the way.
i say this because no one is as powerful as an evil superman on the bad guys side, and as far as the good guys go han always shoots first.
but make no doubt about it, by no means is this contest’s intention to be a popularity contest.
the world is now doomed there is no more hope.
it  ain’t easy being green… march 21st, 2012 at 5:36 am dennis` says: batman will hope superman can still catch up march 20th, 2012 at 10:17 pm scott says: spidey should certainly win simply because he *always* wins, no matter how  outclassed he may seem.
i suppose.. may best win!
he is the badass of all!
always vote fort the preditor.
apone: uh…hulk’s unbelieveably strong and only gets stronger  the madder he gets…?
april 10th, 2012 at 7:11 am r. says: are you serious?
april 5th, 2012 at 10:16 am tomandshell says: yoda is a great character, but he failed to defeat both count dooku and  palpatine before retreating and going into hiding.
march 21st, 2012 at 9:27 pm hulk smash!!
round 1 mar 15th - 21st april 11th, 2012 at 7:06 am benjaminp says: bigbunny says: yoda wins?!
darth vader: “you don’t know the power of the dark side!”
now that the obvious has been established, gen.zod would  do the *exact* same thing.
force power would turn his batarangs right around and plunge them into his face and chest!!!!
popularity contests are boring and vs battles have been done to  death.
very well then, yoda vs vader it is…
get email alerts about bracket winners and new match-ups!
will it be a lionized gaurdian of  goodwill, a master miscreant or perhaps a downtrodden underdog who never plays  by the rules?
these are fun, yes, but they are the fun hypotheticals of  “who would win in a fight” that you’d normally have with your  buddy.
and clearly batman’s got this.
i whish i could see some of these battles… april 10th, 2012 at 1:13 am bigbunny says: yoda wins?!
march 18th, 2012 at 9:49 am terre says: if anyone seriously believes that indiana jones can ever beat wonder woman,  they are seriously seriously deluded.
…and r2-d2 april 5th, 2012 at 11:26 am travis says: yoda will win this one finally.
april 5th, 2012 at 11:11 am don howard says: should be yoda.
unfortunately, that’s what it is.
march 26th, 2012 at 9:28 pm trooper says: looks like boba fell to red skull.
march 21st, 2012 at 7:25 pm vs1976 says: okay who’s voting on round 2?
ww loses her powers  when tied up by a man (hey, don’t look at me, i don’t make the  rules).
i’d like to see godzilla versus any combination of characters,godzilla wins hands down… what, kroenen but no hellboy!?
march 31st, 2012 at 4:51 pm philmc says: this poll is a sham of autobot voting as i voted for batman (who would  never lose to jones) where batman was leading the vote at 50.45% & returned  to the poll a second later and he was down to 48.48%.
march 26th, 2012 at 9:24 pm h.p. says: hey d.b. i gotta agree with you, that’s the same result i got on my  end.
indy  would not last one second in an apocalyptic zombie infected world, he’s  afraid of snakes.
so for all you over-charged nerds screaming ‘no way’ get over it already & have some fun voting for your favorite characters!
this one happens to be on a larger scale.
yoda is a great character, but he failed to defeat both count dooku and palpatine before retreating and going into hiding.
march 26th, 2012 at 10:03 am granite says: the biggest upset in my opinion is the joker loosing to the red skull.
but make no  doubt about it, by no means is this contest’s intention to be a  popularity contest.
superman would beat the hulk.
the predator has laser projectiles and is invisible.
i am a little surprised to see some results but this  is a bit of fun!
march 20th, 2012 at 10:00 pm scott says: would superman totally trash megatron in a fight?
it’s a “versus,”  not a pageant.
if it is not by how we know the characters and what they are capable of,  but rather this ‘fun’ element, what point is there?
because guild 3rd stage navigators from arakis were seen arriving and leaving ss headquarters the whole time and now are nowhere to be found.
march 19th, 2012 at 2:01 am melvin minifig says:
at this point, it’s going to probably be yoda vs darth vader in  the finale.
at this point, it’s going to probably be yoda vs darth vader in the finale.
march 27th, 2012 at 2:04 pm ralphie says: lets face it this is not a heroes/villians super power contest..or all the  remaining would have been eliminated already.
no way yoda should win this  final battle.
of course, those are percentages so the tenths place could have pushed  it over for indie.
must be alot of star wars fans here !!!
therefore, yoda could beat vader.
old age  and treachery will most always overcome youth and skill april 4th, 2012 at 7:01 pm trooper says: no daring, last minute rescues this time mr. jones.
who will be the last character standing?
the emperor seemed to have the upper hand, dooku fled.. to be saved the disgrace of being defeated..
march 28th, 2012 at 12:29 pm jay says: yes it looks to be a popularity contest, but it’s still fun to watch  the outcomes.
seriously do u think indiana jones can beat wolverine or hulk over yoda??
sauron, optimus prime, superman, and wonder woman were very clear winners in their round one brackets.
vader is going down.
was this a favorite character contest or a who would win contest?
of course, those are percentages so the tenths place could have pushed it over for indie.
yoda vs darkvader really…….indy beats batman???
surprise surprise… way too many star wars fans out there not to let it happen.
what the heck guys?!?
how does hulk beat superman?
how indy beat wonder woman to begin with is ridiculous enough, but wolverine?!
same thing with ripley vs. spidey.
march 19th, 2012 at 1:24 pm jess says: final match by popular vote?
anything else is childish compared to these cybertronian giants can’t wait for this battleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee tf power!!!!!!!
superman could only be destroyed by one thing only,and no one in this battle haves or knows superman’s weakness,except for batman-yeah boyyyyy darth vader says “yoda will win”?!?!?!
fett march 19th, 2012 at 1:19 pm eric says: this is an awesome idea, can not wait for the final results.. can i cheer  for my favorite?
look at the top of the page and you’ll read,  “which iconic character has the stuff to defeat the agents of armageddon  predicted to descend upon us this year?”
march 28th, 2012 at 4:25 pm eric says:
what it’s not saying is,  “let’s discover which character would win a geeky beauty contest  just before the world ended in 2012!”
i am a little surprised to see some results but this is a bit of fun!
really now, how does that  happen!!!
unfortunately yoda is the master so….
this is so much fun!
while zod is on earth no light  saber,web,steel claws,batarang or whip can touch him.
either way, it was close so wolvie went down swing…  indie… wolvie… didn’t see that coming.
what criteria are we  supposed to use?
the final battle seems pretty cut and dry.
how does any normal human female have even the slightest of chances against a person who has super agility, “spider sense”, web shooters, and can lift 10 tons?
doesn’t even seem fair.
indy would not last one second in an apocalyptic zombie infected world, he’s afraid of snakes.
hulk would have to reach mega po’ed levels to match superman’s power.
indy vs vader would be fun.
is it bad that i don’t know who kroenen & general zod are?
i absolutely cannot believe that he is  winning that battle.
you could pit and ant against superman and have the ant win..it would make just as much sense as some of the results we are seeing here.
he’d lay the smackdown on those candy asses!!!!
indy how can anyone beat freddy?
was this a favorite character contest or a who would win  contest?
he ran away to dagobah cause he knew he couldn’t beat  anakin, vader wins easy \m/ april 9th, 2012 at 7:12 pm ralphie says: yoda?truth is we all know this battle really took place in a universe far  far away from the dc universe.
arakis were seen arriving and leaving ss headquarters the whole time and now  are nowhere to be found.
also  why no gandalf?
march 28th, 2012 at 6:52 am phil c says: vader vs zod, that is beyond awesomeness!!!!!
march 23rd, 2012 at 4:53 pm tank0211 says: this is not about who ‘should’ technically win people!
i said it before, it’s a popularity contest..
the only possibility is for yoda to use the force to turn into  satele shan.
he is a better teacher than  fighter, but i’m voting for him anyway.
march 24th, 2012 at 10:23 am bigphatpaulie says: i’m happy to read that superman beat hulk.
this is already screwy..
march 18th, 2012 at 9:22 am bud says: i’d like to see godzilla versus any combination of  characters,godzilla wins hands down… march 18th, 2012 at 6:04 am anung un rama says: what, kroenen but no hellboy!?
make your pick now for a chance to win big!enter now » bigbunny says: yoda wins?!
march 15th, 2012 at 8:00 pm iceman_becker says: after i vote for person is anything suppose to happen because it just went  back and refreshed who i should vote for does it not put anything next to your  picks or what??
indiana jones could survive this any day.
march 22nd, 2012 at 6:00 pm scott says: @
and then it’ll be all over.
march 22nd, 2012 at 11:41 am mattie says: whoa whoa whoa, indiana over wonder woman.
if anyone seriously believes that indiana jones can ever beat wonder woman, they are seriously seriously deluded.
freddy can do whatever he want to!
hey, i like indy as much as anyone, but at some point logic has to be applied, yes?
who would win in a fight against each other?
what it’s not saying is, “let’s discover which character would win a geeky beauty contest just before the world ended in 2012!”
yeah, where is mort?!?
april 2nd, 2012 at 7:39 am queso6p4 says: indy beat batman…i was not expecting that at all.
the correct answer is:  yes, within seconds.
final match by popular vote?
obi-wan would kick batman’s a$$!!!!
the correct answer is: yes, within seconds.
april 2nd, 2012 at 12:49 pm gravitz says: it will probably end-up the way it should have ended, a long time ago in a  galaxy far away.
after i vote for person is anything suppose to happen because it just went back and refreshed who i should vote for does it not put anything next to your picks or what??
the only thing yoda ever lost was his hair!
ya gotta go… march 20th, 2012 at 12:12 pm elias najera says: joker will win march 20th, 2012 at 8:59 am aaron garcia says: all jedi rulea march 20th, 2012 at 8:49 am atomica.der says: the predator has laser projectiles and is invisible.
i was hoping for a star  wars/predator match up.
lets do what  is right.
which iconic character has the stuff to defeat the agents of armageddon  predicted to descend upon us this year?
he looked into the light of  the queen alien’s eyes and his head exploded while indy slipped out the  back door.
sideshow's privacy policy » who will be the last character standing?
the x-men, the hulk, spider-man…twice!”
indy caught him by surprise since he was dressed in a suit and  they were just having dinner.
vader vs zod, that is beyond awesomeness!!!!!
i think we have winner
i say this  because no one is as powerful as an evil superman on the bad guys side, and as  far as the good guys go han always shoots first.
this poll is a sham of autobot voting as i voted for batman (who would never lose to jones) where batman was leading the vote at 50.45% & returned to the poll a second later and he was down to 48.48%.
so this is a popularity contest?
o well all in  good fun i suppose.. may best win!
yoda is good but you cant beat the empire!
it’s a fun popularity contest to go along w/ the ncaa tourney.
people are so predictable.
lets unite and save the world from chaos.
it is unfortunate that some (probably more) view this and vote as if it were a popularity contest.
and i look forward to seeing who wins.

this has gone from a “who would honestly win” to a popularity contest.
april 5th, 2012 at 4:56 pm daff says: yoda will banish vader – the dark side will not overcome april 5th, 2012 at 12:50 pm jedijones says: evil will always triumph because good is dumb!
yoda vs darth vader indy beats wonder woman, then beats wolverine and now is beating batman.
as much as i like maul i doubt his lightsaber can repel spells.
but vader is just the underling of the emperor, and we all know that vader has a weakness for good..
april 5th, 2012 at 11:23 am ghostwolf says: oh come on…vader is way way cooler compared to yoda.
march 23rd, 2012 at 8:31 am queso6p4 says: some of these winners don’t make any sense.
i absolutely cannot believe that he is winning that battle.
@daron woodward – you haven’t read jla: tower of babel, have you?
1st round was a wash, most the winners are ridiculous.
isn’t he afraid of snakes?
all indy would have to do is lasso her with his whip (as he does willie at the end of temple of doom) and she’s instantly helpless.
the hulk will smash the competition too bad magneto stayed home!
april 5th, 2012 at 11:06 pm gabriel gaucher says: c’mon!
march 23rd, 2012 at 1:41 pm bina says: @daron woodward – you haven’t read jla: tower of babel, have  you?
indy caught him by surprise since he was dressed in a suit and they were just having dinner.
if doomsday can beat/kill superman, i am sure the hulk can do that too!
and the accounting firm of price waterhouse/sideshow who tallied the secret votes must have been high on the spice melange’ the whole battle.
these are fun, yes, but they are the fun hypotheticals of “who would win in a fight” that you’d normally have with your buddy.
yoda vs darth vader march 31st, 2012 at 7:52 pm x-men says: indy beats wonder woman, then beats wolverine and now is beating batman.
i say batman for the win.
that fight never made sense in the first place.
how does any normal human  female have even the slightest of chances against a person who has super  agility, “spider sense”, web shooters, and can lift 10 tons?
march 31st, 2012 at 4:40 pm darthky says: how the hell is indiana beating batman?!?!?!
march 12th, 2012 at 8:08 pm usswanker says: wait!
and the accounting firm of price  waterhouse/sideshow who tallied the secret votes must have been high on the  spice melange’ the whole battle.
it ain’t easy being green… batman will hope superman can still catch up spidey should certainly win simply because he *always* wins, no matter how outclassed he may seem.
april 10th, 2012 at 10:24 am r2q5 says: yoda turned vader!
should have known it will be 2 star wars characters in the final.
make your pick now for a chance to  win big!
for getting this far, he already  deserves his last crusade pf april 2nd, 2012 at 2:12 pm josh-a-tron says: indy beating batman dropped my interest in this pretty low.
i guess this means that movies are  more popular than comics in the collectibles community.
popularity contests are boring and vs battles have been done to death.
april 6th, 2012 at 10:55 am paulie says: vader is the poster child for star wars and the greatest fictional villain  of all time.
for getting this far, he already deserves his last crusade pf indy beating batman dropped my interest in this pretty low.
well what is happening here, is people vote their favorite hero/villain to win not taking in consideration that certain powers, outweigh others.. like obi wan would use the force on batman and thou i am a big batman fan, i fear the force would smack batman sideways.. and clearly not all voters look at it the same way… yeah… this isn’t about who could beat who in a fight.
eventually yoda is going to have to rest and be unable to keep suspending the hulk in mid-air, y’all.
ok, so i guess the conspiracy was to make sure that darth vader and yoda ended up in the finals.
it will probably end-up the way it should have ended, a long time ago in a galaxy far away.
it turned out 50/50 from what i saw today.
okay who’s voting on round 2?
optimus prime vs megatron of course!!!!!!!!!!
march 31st, 2012 at 3:00 pm mark cooper says: vader march 29th, 2012 at 6:09 pm hatch tarr says: kneel to zod!

optimus prime defeated from spidey?
march 28th, 2012 at 12:22 pm andrew says: u know what, this competition is getting boring, wolverine vs. indianna  jones?
the real heavy metal fight by faaaaaaaar!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i’m disappointed in that final 4.
march 28th, 2012 at 3:14 pm jason says: yoda over hulk ?
indy actually could defeat wonder woman pretty easily.
old age and treachery will most always overcome youth and skill no daring, last minute rescues this time mr. jones.
i cannot accept however that indy bested the bat  – that’s just insane!!
it has clearly become a popularity contest, but it is actually about who would survive longer in a zombie apocalypse, so it should neither be a battle between the two nor a popularity contest, if you actually read what the contest is about.
april 2nd, 2012 at 1:53 pm kgix says: the final battle seems pretty cut and dry.
besides, ironman would  lay the hurt on wolverine (wouldn’t even have the time to regenerate)
march 18th, 2012 at 4:53 pm mark rutledge says: always vote fort the preditor.
would superman totally trash megatron in a fight?
he is an archaeologist with a gun who has been knocked out repeated times by 100 lb women… i love indy, but wtf?
march 22nd, 2012 at 9:18 pm bigbunny says: i still have no idea who general zod is?

march 26th, 2012 at 3:22 pm daniel bernier says: yoda vs darth vader march 26th, 2012 at 12:05 pm eric says: well what is happening here, is people vote their favorite hero/villain to  win not taking in consideration that certain powers, outweigh others.. like obi  wan would use the force on batman and thou i am a big batman fan, i fear the  force would smack batman sideways.. and clearly not all voters look at it the  same way… march 26th, 2012 at 10:27 am drew says: yeah… this isn’t about who could beat who in a fight.
are you guys saying we’re getting snake pllssken and john mcclane this year?????
kroenen: “of course…” * vader slashes him in half * kroenen, as he groans on the floor: “now i do.”

april 2nd, 2012 at 12:57 pm jedijones says: batman’s curiosity got the best of him.
april 2nd, 2012 at 2:04 pm cheungkinmen says: it was vader vs yoda all along.
so zombies will just  ignore him.
hey, i like indy as much as anyone, but at some point logic has to  be applied, yes?
force power would turn his batarangs right around and plunge them  into his face and chest!!!!
indy won against wonder woman?
who would have thought that  superman would get eliminated in the 1st round?!?
march 23rd, 2012 at 1:12 am daron woodward says: it’s a great shame that there has been no small amount of deliberate  ‘spoiling’ going on.
deadpool said it best in response to cain  marko’s classic line, “nothing stops the juggernaut!”
after all he’s been through  some similar depths.
long live “lord vader”
yoda will banish vader – the dark side will not overcome evil will always triumph because good is dumb!
march 19th, 2012 at 4:54 am billy says: go yoda !
superman has beaten the hulk in the  marvel vs dc story line.
how could he not win?

april 2nd, 2012 at 11:22 pm darren says: star wars all the way to the final dual!
march 27th, 2012 at 6:26 am x-men says: to all x-man fans.
vader will reign supreme!!
who drew up these brackets?
vader vs yoda yyyeeeeaahhhh well would have loved to see this on the big screen come now, really?
really now, how does that happen!!!
who would have thought that superman would get eliminated in the 1st round?!?
that was fun i like ironman ironman win
march 28th, 2012 at 4:47 pm derekdnm says: i have a feeling that yoda gonna face darth vader in the final!
i guess it went by some computer program weighting  system?
a strong pokemon would beat him… ha ha these results are completely ridiculous.
like a cows opinion…it doesn’t matter; it’s moo.”
i’m voting but the stats aren’t changing?
as much as i like maul i  doubt his lightsaber can repel spells.
cart surviving the apocalypse requires more than good looks.
doom will find a way to come in at the end, and at the victor’s weakest point, he will take the infinity gauntlet from them.
even vader has living flesh.
are you guys saying we’re getting snake pllssken and john  mcclane this year?????
says: sorry guys prime would squash spidey… march 18th, 2012 at 6:56 pm marilyn taylor says: super contest, makes me think, which doesn’t happen too often march 18th, 2012 at 6:04 pm leo says: hulk vs. superman in round one???
how the hell is indiana beating batman?!?!?!
i was hoping for a star wars/predator match up.
it turned out 50/50  from what i saw today.
the x-men, the  hulk, spider-man…twice!”
it’s a “versus,” not a pageant.
march 21st, 2012 at 6:12 pm scott says: eventually yoda is going to have to rest and be unable to keep suspending  the hulk in mid-air, y’all.
while zod is on earth no light saber,web,steel claws,batarang or whip can touch him.
all indy would have to do is lasso her with his whip (as he does willie  at the end of temple of doom)
which character we would like to  see realised in three dimensions?
hahaha.. vote it’s fake, without doubt april 2nd, 2012 at 1:20 pm vitus says: wonder woman > indy april 2nd, 2012 at 1:10 pm joe g says: how can anyone beat freddy?
the only possibility is for yoda to use the force to turn into satele shan.
like, for example, indiana jones would be able to beat wolverine in a fight.
cmon, he’s a muppet with a lightsaber!
indy vs wolverine now come on lets be real, wolverine would take care of him in less than a second.
it’s a great shame that there has been no small amount of deliberate ‘spoiling’ going on.
march 19th, 2012 at 12:43 pm magik says: how the heck can indiana jones beat wonder woman?
march 28th, 2012 at 2:35 pm goblin king says:
the vote was  not limpid..i am not going to deal again..
march 19th, 2012 at 11:56 am michael little says: yoda wins it all!
he is a better teacher than fighter, but i’m voting for him anyway.
ken benobi says: yoda trained luke, who had vader beat.
he ran away to dagobah cause he knew he couldn’t beat anakin, vader wins easy \m/ yoda?truth is we all know this battle really took place in a universe far far away from the dc universe.
should have known it will be 2 star wars characters in  the final.
april 2nd, 2012 at 1:32 pm autobot says: batman has missed?
yoda trained luke, who had vader beat.
will it be a lionized gaurdian of goodwill, a master miscreant or perhaps a downtrodden underdog who never plays by the rules?
march 28th, 2012 at 12:14 pm jorge gonzalez says: krueger will destroy all march 28th, 2012 at 12:11 pm don howard says: interesting matchups and will be curious when the new brackets come out march 28th, 2012 at 11:51 am mattie says: with indiana and general zod in the “elite” eight of this  tournament, i mattie, of sound mind and body, must respectfully decline any  further participation or condonation of said tournament.
i love wolverine and the t-1000
i love some of the comments!
march 29th, 2012 at 5:30 pm dustin rider says: look at the results for the wolverine vs indiana fight.
little green jedi masters rule!!!!!
it happened twice already!
he’s faster and has tons more experience.
hahaha.. vote it’s fake, without doubt wonder woman >
march 8th, 2012 at 4:36 pm autobot says: optimus prime vs megatron of course!!!!!!!!!!
march 18th, 2012 at 11:55 am kevin says: indiana jones could survive this any day.
vader is the poster child for star wars and the greatest fictional villain of all time.
only your vote will decide.
also why no gandalf? :/ boba fett is the best bounty hunter in the galaxy, absolutely win against the queen!
march 25th, 2012 at 8:04 pm kim bond says: this is so much fun!
to all x-men fans lets do what is  right.
some of these winners don’t make any sense.
march 24th, 2012 at 9:25 am cap_america says: it is unfortunate that some (probably more) view this and vote as if it  were a popularity contest.
march 15th, 2012 at 2:58 pm benjaminp says: yoda is a shoe in!
which character we would like to see realised in three dimensions?
after all he’s been through some similar depths.
i can’t disagree with that, though indiana jones and freddy krueger being in the semi-finals is a travesty.
which iconic character has the stuff to defeat the agents of armageddon predicted to descend upon us this year?
yoda vs darth vader
he basically is a zombie!
any normal human against a superhuman is going to lose, easy as, no matter how wiley or well tooled-up that human’s belt might be (and this from an mad batman fan), or handy with a whip they are.
probably faster due to the ruthless factor.
plenty stops the juggernaut!
and freddy krueger and the red skull in the final four?
what are these  voters smoking?
is a freaking nightmare how darth vader can beat him!
superman has beaten the hulk in the marvel vs dc story line.
march 28th, 2012 at 11:20 am darth impulsive says: obi-wan would kick batman’s a$$!!!!
march 24th, 2012 at 7:31 am pezlort says:
and now everybody at sideshow’s eyes have a blue  tinge.
anyway, is it allowed to bring kryptonite  to the match?
comment on: march madness 2012… your comment:
some awesome matchups predators going to own everyone sauron for the win, period the hulk!!!!
so i guess none of it is true is it
yes it looks to be a popularity contest, but it’s still fun to watch the outcomes.
besides, ironman would lay the hurt on wolverine (wouldn’t even have the time to regenerate)
1-855-sideshow int’l 1-805-214-2157 tuesday, april 10, 2012 surviving the apocalypse requires more than good looks.
sauron, optimus  prime, superman, and wonder woman were very clear winners in their round one  brackets.
it’s like swimming against the current, but i voted for freddy and indy xd .
these battles are surprising me.
april 5th, 2012 at 12:06 pm ralphie says: dooku laughed the entire time he was kicking yoda’s little green  butt.
wolverine is the man.
he looked into the light of the queen alien’s eyes and his head exploded while indy slipped out the back door.
i cannot accept however that indy bested the bat – that’s just insane!!
vader is your worst nightmare….. darth vader vs yoda the masters….. go indy..
hulk would have to reach mega po’ed levels to match superman’s
i’m really hoping he wins this april 6th, 2012 at 10:40 am scribe_well says: can i vote for galactus?
are we voting for a) who would fare better against a zombie horde (sorry, giant robots this week)?
march 19th, 2012 at 11:33 am lawrence belisle says: great one march 19th, 2012 at 7:39 am frodo says: go logan!
dooku laughed the entire time he was kicking yoda’s little green butt.
how the heck can indiana jones beat wonder woman?
oh come on…vader is way way cooler compared to yoda.
march 18th, 2012 at 8:09 pm carlos perez.

how the heck did red skull beat boba fett???
april 2nd, 2012 at 12:58 pm neil murphy says: vader will reign supreme!!
march 28th, 2012 at 8:52 am sprig says: this has gone from a “who would honestly win” to a popularity  contest.
u know what, this competition is getting boring, wolverine vs. indianna jones?
krueger will destroy all interesting matchups and will be curious when the new brackets come out with indiana and general zod in the “elite” eight of this tournament, i mattie, of sound mind and body, must respectfully decline any further participation or condonation of said tournament.
and she’s instantly helpless.
sorry guys prime would squash spidey… super contest, makes me think, which doesn’t happen too often hulk vs. superman in round one???
a strong pokemon  would beat him… march 24th, 2012 at 12:41 pm eq says: ha ha these results are completely ridiculous.
march 28th, 2012 at 6:54 am phil c says: how the heck did red skull beat boba fett???
that fight never made  sense in the first place.
i’m still astounded that joker got  knocked out so early.
does anybody on this forum know who red skull is?
*sigh* i’m here for the prize anyways.
very well then, yoda vs vader  it is… april 2nd, 2012 at 6:38 pm goblin king says: ok, so i guess the conspiracy was to make sure that darth vader and yoda  ended up in the finals.
what are these voters smoking?
he ran away to dagobah cause he knew he couldn’t beat anakin, vader wins easy \m/ he ran away cause he couldnt beat palpatine, besides indiana jones would have been slaughtered by wolverine
lecter can’t bloody well eat the t1000 that psycho shrink is dooomed !!
march 19th, 2012 at 2:33 pm eason p says: this is awesome.
that’s like hearing mit romney say “barrack o’bama will win.”
march 26th, 2012 at 10:00 am scribe_well says: indy actually could defeat wonder woman pretty easily.
any normal human against a superhuman is going to lose, easy as, no matter  how wiley or well tooled-up that human’s belt might be (and this from an  mad batman fan), or handy with a whip they are.
indiana jones beat wolverine?
star wars all the way to the final dual!
series content, product specifications, release dates and pricing are subject to change.
and if he  really pisses her off, he could always hide out in a lead-lined 1950s fridge  (sorry, i really hated crystal skull…) march 26th, 2012 at 5:49 am arlene maldonado says: hulk all the way !!!
…and r2-d2 yoda will win this one finally.
i can’t disagree with that, though indiana jones  and freddy krueger being in the semi-finals is a travesty.
that being said, it’s all in fun
looks like boba fell to red skull.
i played it out loads of times with different outcomes
predators going to own everyone march 18th, 2012 at 12:19 pm gruesam says: sauron for the win, period march 18th, 2012 at 12:04 pm jcruz0721 says: the hulk!!!!
if it is not by how we know the characters and what they are capable of, but rather this ‘fun’ element, what point is there?
this is not about who ‘should’ technically win people!
is indy really catching up to yoda right now…?
and if he really pisses her off, he could always hide out in a lead-lined 1950s fridge (sorry, i really hated crystal skull…) hulk all the way !!!
indy beat batman…i was not expecting that at all.
boba fett is the best bounty hunter in the galaxy, absolutely win against  the queen!
eric said it best, people pick favorites….
i’m happy to read that superman beat hulk.
round 2 mar 22nd - 27th
i’m still astounded that joker got knocked out so early.
win yoda will hmmmmmmm…… the dark lord of the sith has totally got this.
april 2nd, 2012 at 3:06 pm edison says: go indy!!!!
i have a feeling that yoda gonna face darth vader in the final!
so now it’s up to  the force to see how ridiculous this contest turns out batman.
because guild 3rd stage navigators from
april 2nd, 2012 at 1:11 am lucypher says: indy won match with batman?
doesn’t even seem  fair.
ww loses her powers when tied up by a man (hey, don’t look at me, i don’t make the rules).
still think gandalf should’ve been in this \m/ yoda all the way indy found out who batman is and used the whip on him while dressed as bruce wayne.
o well all in good fun
palpatine tossed yoda around like a beach ball.
the new trilogy didn’t help out poor vader, conversely… vader did outlive yoda in the original trilogy… yoda because hayden ruined vader.
round 3 mar 28th - apr 1st
who the heck chose ripley over spiderman?!?
i’m guessing a yoda vs vader matchup.
march 24th, 2012 at 7:23 am antonio says: if doomsday can beat/kill superman, i am sure the hulk can do that too!
i love wolverine and the t-1000 but zi wouldnt want to see either destroyed!
april 5th, 2012 at 9:46 am craxyd says: yoda all the way.
are we voting for a) who would fare better  against a zombie horde (sorry, giant robots this week)?
so for all  you over-charged nerds screaming ‘no way’ get over it already &  have some fun voting for your favorite characters!
lets face it this is not a heroes/villians super power contest..or all the remaining would have been eliminated already.
batman is quite capable glad chuck norris was not considered for these battles… how can indy beat wonder woman and now be winning against wolverine?
march 28th, 2012 at 10:33 am drunkenboxer says: i’m guessing a yoda vs vader matchup.
march 24th, 2012 at 9:55 am tomandshell says: go indy!!!
hint hint huh? march 12th, 2012 at 3:28 am darth vader says: yoda will win march 10th, 2012 at 2:20 pm lamelnik says: you forgot mort!!!!!
now that the obvious has been established, gen.zod would do the *exact* same thing.
- apr 4th round 3 mar 28th - apr 1st
march 22nd, 2012 at 9:32 pm jer says: what?
no way yoda should win this final battle.
the emperor seemed to have the upper hand, dooku fled.. to be  saved the disgrace of being defeated..
least vader has a similar color scheme yes..yes..
wayne was hiring indy to find a lost relic.
