20 april 2012 12:40pm er, @scrunge, on behalf of the legions of fans of the recent marvel films, let me assure you that many of the most hardcore are female.

america gave us spiderman, where getting bitten by a spider stops you getting bullied at school.
in our increasingly secular society, with so many disparate gods and different faiths, superhero films present a unique canvas upon which our shared hopes, dreams and apocalyptic nightmares can be projected and played out.

20 april 2012 1:13pm the seemingly endless conveyor belt of formulaic comic book films is more evidence of how culturally bankrupt hollywood really is.
the response was to a (seeming) republican claiming superiority of the us over the uk for having elected a black president.
america gave us superman, supporting the state at all costs.
i love big action movies me.
loki, in fact, is one of the best written and most complex characters i have seen in film in the last year and tom portrayed him so sympathetically that - with absolutely no disrespect to chris - i felt greater empathy toward loki than i did thor.
i believed that there could be someone so good, honest, true, with ethics and a depth of feeling for his fellow man that was impermeable.
if anything, engaging with a mythology whose ideals we don't agree with is a great way of thinking about which values we believe are actually worthwhile.
his performance was dark, anarchic, dizzying, free, and totally, thrillingly, dangerous.
captain america is a poster boy for martial heroism in military combat: the natural leader, the war hero.
the majority are terribly done.
the guardian article history about this article close superheroes movies like avengers assemble should not be scorned this article was published onguardian.co.uk at 20.33 bst on thursday 19 april 2012.
with the odd exception most superhero films have been utterly wooden or gormless or both.
robocop to be the best "judge dredd" movie so far made, but iron man has a more sophisticated wit and irony than verhoven's classic (except for the last dreadful battle with iron monger, which almost ruins the film).
heath ledger flat out is the joker in the dark knight.
there, so please take back my appreciation to your cast and crew, and i am as far from the programmed audience of teenage american boys as you can get: an adult international woman of not unrefined tastes.
first has to be props for christopher reeve and richard donner, who set the template for all superhero movie right out of the gate.
also see spiderman 3, any film with wolverine in, etc.
11:59am thank you for a piece that knows that at heart every story is about the character.
the possibility that there can be individuals who epitomize such polar extremes of character – virtues such as courage, honor, love even, as well as the incredibly illuminating traits of fear, anger, hopelessness, doubt – to the point of such rarity that they inspire art and literature in multiple forms… it’s ridiculously thrilling!
this wasn't villainy by rote - this character could do the unexpected at almost every term.
superhero movies also represent the pinnacle of cinema as "motion picture".
they got me into learning, to loving the medium of literature and i guess that's the same for a lot of adults today.
and heath ledger's performance in the dark knight quite simply changed the game.
i'm not really a fan of nolan's take on batman, the need to make it ultra realistic, to me, makes them less fun.
the odyssey was infuriatingly simplistic - 'good' people could do horrific things (telemachus' slaying of penelope's suitors etc etc) but it was irrelevant because they were chosen by the gods.
how the hell did they manage to pull off something as cheesy - on paper - as supes breaking the 4th wall and waving to the audience.
i'd like to think that the lumière brothers would thrill at the cat-and-mouse chase through the netherworld streets of gotham in the dark knight, with helicopters tripping on high-tensile wires and falling from the sky, and a huge joker-driven triple-length truck upending 180 degrees like a russian acrobat.
they are flawed, damaged and ultimately more human, even if that is monstrously human, than the good guy, hand on nipple, god bless america types.
photograph: zade rosenthal actors in any capacity, artists of any stripe, are inspired by their curiosity, by their desire to explore all quarters of life, in light and in dark, and reflect what they find in their work.
i don't think the lumerie brothers would marvel at comic book films.
britain, on the other hand... 20 april 2012 7:58amresponse to spartacusmars, 20 april 2012 3:52am nah, your examples of british comics are all excellent of course, but watchmen, the invisibles, and even the second half of v for vendetta where paid for by the american industry you so despise.
bad guys evil plan, no matter how good, how brilliant, how ingenious, will be thwarted, usually by a guy in a costume, punching him or by an act of physical superiority.
i devoured them, i learnt from them, i saw things i would never have seen through them.
ancient societies had anthropomorphic gods: a huge pantheon expanding into centuries of dynastic drama; fathers and sons, martyred heroes, star-crossed lovers, the deaths of kings – stories that taught us of the danger of hubris and the primacy of humility.
britain gave us the invisibles, which handily informs us strong drugs and kinky sex are pretty much peak human experiences.
20 april 2012 8:24am i'd say movies - and especially superhero movies - are more about escapism than truth.
it doesn't matter if the story is about superheroes or a damaged boy named kevin or a retired spy named george, if you can't be brought to care about these people then the film will be just another piece of popcorn fluff.
they make for decent thrillers but to me batman is about gothic detective action and at times horror.
america produced captain america, without hint of irony.
i groaned when he gave his origin story....but later when he gave an alternate origin i grinned like the cheshire cat.
heroes are fascinating.
the movies, however, can be stupendous or they can be rank.
marvel comics allowed me to having a reading age of 12 when i was 7.
i'm aware that is over-simplifying everything a lot, but i think it's an interesting contrast between the treatment of heroes in two pieces (the iliad and the odyssey) that arise in the same period of history.
otherwise a good article, i hope the avengers movie is actually good.
" it's also incredibly moving when the people on the subway come to spidey's aid.
these are american made products, which aggressively push an american agenda.
i even liked the characterizations of minor players, like her assistant and the shield person...
:) 20 april 2012 6:20amresponse to spartacusmars, 20 april 2012 3:52am america gave the world comic book characters people all over the planet have actually loved and enjoyed for decades.
i have thoroughly enjoyed the latest raft, purely because the avengers has always been my favourite comic in marvel's canon.
and let's face it, watchmen was riffing off established charlston comics heros, and invisibles similarly riffed off dcs superscouts (and went on to become best.
superhoeroes are easy to love and enjoy, but to the european reader, they will always be problematic becuase of their unironic right wing agenda, .
as for films, superman i & ii stood out as the only good examples of the genre that made it to the screen prior to burton bringing batman to us in 1989.
it was not intended to assert superiority so much as simply inform of the facts.
the female lead, sorry i am forgetting her name, i find her more than a bit annoying (in general, sorry, it happens) but here, it worked...she managed to not annoy me at all.
you clearly suffer from an inferiority complex to the us and need to make up for it by highlighting minor differences that make you feel better.
these truths challenge each other, recoil from each other, reflect each other, ignore each other, tease each other, are blind to each other.
when considering superheroes, you can't ignore arguably the first real (in my opinion and knowledge, which is minimal), 'favoured by the gods' superhero - odysseus in the odyssey.
"i still believe in heroes," says samuel l jackson's nick fury in avengers assemble.
one cannot discuss the influence that heroes have on people for very long without bringing up don quixote, so here he is.
if the avengers movie possesses even one of these compelling and fascinating characteristics, then the ongoing quest of all heroes has been more than fulfilled, and will continue to be incredibly inspiring.
makes me feel compelled to chime in with my 2 cents, for what it's worth.
i do see a difference between the characters of 2000ad and the characters from the marvel studios.
no superhero film is automatically good or bad, in the same way no film is automatically good or bad.
it maybe dressed up in soul searching and angst, but in the end, if we can punch you harder, we win, you lose.
reeve, to my mind, was the first real superhero.
when he called home to report that he'd landed the lead in superman his father assumed he was talking about shaw'sman and superman.
i'd like to think that the lumière brothers would thrill at the cat-and-mouse chase through the netherworld streets of gotham in the dark knight, with helicopters tripping on high-tensile wires and falling from the sky, and a huge joker-driven triple-length truck upending 180 degrees like a russian acrobat.
these films are just simplistic - albeit sometimes entertaining - nonsense.
the possibility of redemption is right around the corner, but we have to earn it.
i believe that's why so many of us are drawn towards superman, captain america, thor...and even those considered the villains in our divisional mindset of 'good vs evil' - brilliant characters such as loki, doc ock, lex, etc... from the comics and books to the silver screen, i think we are so fortunate to have such incredible characters come to life - who all, really, come from many shades of grey who have chosen their paths shaped by their interactions in life.
heroism in pop culture may have something interesting to contribute to self-examination and self-realisation; however, it has little positive effect on how to live as a participating, responsible individual in society.
the villain often uses their brains to become stronger than the hero, or handicap the hero (eg kryptonite island in the superman reboot).
i was amazed how much like the movies, thor was much better than captain america and finally comes iron man (imo).
12:22pm nothing wrong with the idea of superhero films.
these films are just simplistic, if sometime entertaining, nonsense.
i think the fight between spidey and doc oc in spiderman 2 that ranges from skyscrapers to the train is to date the single most spectacular superhero action scene ever.
reeve, to my mind, was the first real superhero.
i used to dream of rescuing a girl i had a crush on (my lois lane) from a playground bully (general zod).
20 april 2012 12:43pm the problem with the superhero films is they've lost their freshness.
murphy's humanity is something dredd would probably shoot himself over.
no other superman can ever match up to him, and no other actor has ever conveyed the same hope as any other superhero.
good superhero films combine the best elements of action, human identity, perceptions of morality, aspirational fantasty and humour.
i do wish we could edit our posts to correct the silly mistakes above....sorry again for the rushed print.
i'd like to imagine that reeves' peers, who gave him stick for taking the role, realised the error of their judgement once they saw the product.
superheroes like any media genre will cater (and pander) to a diverse group of people.
in spite of 20 years of mercurial work in the likes of chaplin and kiss kiss bang bang, it was his rock-star-charismatic yet somehow humble tony stark in iron man that helped wider audiences finally embrace the enormous talent ofrobert downey jr.
britain gave us the watchmen, where the masked crusaders were a gang of hooligans and hypocrites.
i think as much as popular culture has had a tangible influence on how we live our lives s as participating individuals, it has been to our detriment.
12:12pm reeve set the benchmark undoubtedly, and (in my humble) he set the bar so high it's never been touched.
i used to dream of rescuing a girl i had a crush on (my lois lane) from a playground bully (general zod).
:) (side note: i just realized that when drawing parallels between the avengers and don quixote, your character turns into a windmill or something.
comics like preacher, the authority, transmetropolitan would never have been printed in this country at all.
20 april 2012 1:47pm what an utter crock of shit, 'superhero' movies are little more than metaphorical promotions of american military imperialism.
shame that hiddleston constantly references the dark knight, aside from ledger's powerful performance it's the most overrated film for years.
while i do think that superheroes and supervillains are best portrayed by classically trained actors, reeve was something else beyond this, someone who truly believed in the calling - and indeed in his own life, became a real superhero in the fight for his health and for the health of others with spinal injuries.
these truths challenge each other, recoil from each other, reflect each other, ignore each other, tease each other, are blind to each other.
the hulk is the perfect metaphor for our fear of anger; its destructive consequences, its consuming fire.
some action with soap opera and hookups(x-men) some action with a touch of romance (various) and some (not me though) enjoy ogling at tasty superpowered underdressed babes http://www.motleyhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/emma-frost-marvel-comic-cover.jpg they're fantastic tales with protagonists sporting greek-god type powers
the league of extrordinary gentlemen basicaly points outt hat all the superhero characters are stolen from classic and pulp literature, redressed slightly and copyrighted.
superhero movies also represent the pinnacle of cinema as "motion picture".
that acting moment alone always completely sells me on the arguably bobbins deus ex machina of changing the earth's rotational spin to turn back time.
finally, in superman 2, when louis guesses his secret.
the heroes always beat them by using their brains or cunning.
artists instinctively want to reflect humanity, their own and each other's, in all its intermittent virtue and vitality, frailty and fallibility.
often they overcome these human frailties for the greater good.
everything else appears to be over-hyped american comedies in which the cast are perpetually drunk off their tits, action targeting those with a lower iq than their packet of popcorn, overly-grotesque slasher horror (bonus facepalm points for found footage), or terribly, terribly british, haw-haw comedy-drama or look at the rich people.
the possibility of redemption is right around the corner, but we have to earn it.
there's not a soul on this earth who hasn't wanted to "hulk smash" something in their lives.
not only american - right wing.
"i still believe in heroes," says samuel l jackson's nick fury in avengers assemble.
replies may also be deleted.
it sounds cliched, but superheroes can be lonely, vain, arrogant and proud.
i can only be grateful that intelligent and smart, and more importantly humane alternatives appear in that field of blockbustering.
other than heath ledger and maybe robert downey, jr. and possibly james mcavoy, i don't think anyone has come quite close enough yet to what he achieved in portrayal of superheroes/supervillains.
yet we frown on them, calling them childish, immature, whilst watching the same generic crap on tv every day of the week.
as a child, when i first learned to dive into a swimming pool, i wasn't diving, i was flying, like superman.
but superhero films offer a shared, faithless, modern mythology, through which these truths can be explored.
the dark knight, might do dark things, but the audience knows he’s the good guy, there for its fine for him to use torture or anything necessary to win the day.
all of the british examples you have used where created 30-40 years after the american ones you compared them too.
now excuse me while i go all don quixote-ish on everyone and run off to sword fight a pine tree.
in our increasingly secular society, with so many disparate gods and different faiths, superhero films present a unique canvas upon which our shared hopes, dreams and apocalyptic nightmares can be projected and played out.
the iron man and incredible hulk plots are exactly the same, ending with them fighting an evil version of themselves.
in the end all super hero films have the same conclusion.
you also have better tea.
you should be really proud of your participation and your work in the film - i know i would be (and trust me that is saying a lot, considering my haughty disdain, hardly healthy i know, nevertheless, that kept me firmly back on the new york off-off stage as a demented sacramental theatre artiste...)
this is damaging, because it acts as a kind of displacement or compensation for the real world, and nothing is done about the real world.
a good superhero film (which the avengers is - i've seen it) is an exciting, immersive, moving experience and they - and the people involved in making them - should be celebrated.
the hulk is the perfect metaphor for our fear of anger; its destructive consequences, its consuming fire.
12:41pm "reeve set the benchmark undoubtedly, and (in my humble) he set the bar so high it's never been touched.
the morality behind greek mythology appears positively alien to us in the 21st century, but we can still enagage with its heroes and gods.
this acts as kind of displacement or compensation for the real world, so nothing gets done about the real world.
after saving louis, saving the pilot and bringing the helicopter safely to the ground amongst a group of astonished and cheering onlookers the first thing out of superman's mouth is "this man needs help".
artists instinctively want to reflect humanity, their own and each other's, in all its intermittent virtue and vitality, frailty and fallibility.
the dark knight condemed and hunted so that the idea of a white knight could remain untainted.
" you obviously haven't been watching closely enough - almost all superhero films involve the hero fighting a physically stronger enemy.
this is where superhero stories are brilliant; they use themes and situations that have enthralled humanity for centuries, and then they twist them just so as to touch a certain cord, a nerve that could affect the way someone sees and confronts the world.
while america gives us batman, embodiment of the trickle down theory, europe comes back with master criminal superhero diabolik.
comics made me the reader i am today.
his performance was dark, anarchic, dizzying, free, and totally, thrillingly, dangerous.
as a child, when i first learned to dive into a swimming pool, i wasn't diving, i was flying, like superman.
even superman jumped the shark with the 3rd and 4th sequels.
the search is clearly what drives the endeavour.
maybe playing superheroes isn't such an ignoble undertaking after all.
we have a whole raft of fantastic writers and artists working in the medium now, many have passed through the 2000ad academy as it were, to prove themselves in america.
these scenes are the result of a creative engine set in motion when the lumières shotl'arrivée d'un train en gare de la ciotat in 1895.
superheroes are fun, and they do present a mythology.
the game changed from batman returns, one of the few examples of a sequel being far superior to the film it followed.
it could all have turned out so much for the worse, instead....looks like the avengers (assemble whatever ) will be rather excellent 19 april 2012
the invisibles isn't very good at all but here it fits pre-defined prejudices clearly.
i leave it with a huge smile on my face.
once tim burton's batman and, later on, bryan singer's x-men proved that it was possible to make a well-crafted film based around a comic book source, they've been accepted as a valid, not-automatically-trashy, genre.
maybe the score helped, but it certainly sent me out of the theatre with a massive goofy grin on my face.
every mythology is rooted in some sort of political outlook, and american superhero stories don't have a monopoly on reactionary politics (tolkien, anyone?).
turn autoplay off turn autoplay on please activate cookies in order to turn autoplay off from superman to batman, superhero films have much to teach us about faith and humanity – as well as being terrrific visual spectacle, writes avengers assemble startom hiddleston earlier this year, beneath the wind-whipped tarpaulin of a catering tent in gloucester, i was working on a film with the actor malcolm sinclair.
watchmen is a dc comic, but you then slate american comics whilst then using an american film as a great example.
the american publishers should be thanked for letting our guys unleash their warped minds on their readers.
i don't however like dc comics much at all, i have always found them rather trite.
very well-written article and spoken like a true former student of the classics
that's ok, the majority of films are terribly done.
america gave us batman, the billionaire scientist olympian who spends his time hitting muggers.
another thing about the cult of the hero (joseph cambell etc) is that it has thrown us back in the arms of gods and destiny (john ralston saul) in our civic lives.
the team ethic, the triumph over insurmountable odds, the gigantic fights, the divorces, the marriages, the losses the team has endured of the decades.
" yeah, like the end of the dark knight where a corrupted harvey dent dies and batman takes responsibility for his crimes post mortem in order to keep the ideal that dent turned his back on alive.
as the btl comments indicate, its one for the fanboys.
when they fall, they fall so incredibly far.
i responded that the americas have had black people for hundreds of years longer than britain, but that the longer-term immigrants to britain, the jewish community, has seen both prime ministers and other other party leaders.
10:26am now i feel a bit guilty at not having mentioned the others who did very well as well.
19 april 2012 8:59pm i reckon the lumière brothers would be pretty darn astonished by superhero films.
in spite of 20 years of mercurial work in the likes of chaplin and kiss kiss bang bang, it was his rock-star-charismatic yet somehow humble tony stark in iron man that helped wider audiences finally embrace the enormous talent ofrobert downey jr.
credit has to be given to the production house thats brings in a branagh to do the film...and his involvement clearly rises the bar all around for that film...the acting was very well done...and you in particular mr. hiddleston, have nothing to apologize for being a part of that film.
i do love watching good performances and well made movies that are not pretentious.
well a whole slew of them...thor being the first, and how clever of the marvel production to leave the films on, in preparation for what i assume is the one you are promoting.
superman as i grew up became my least favourite hero ever, because he was so perfect.
second is the little character moment in the 1st film at the end of the helicopter/skyscraper scene - the first out and out "this is superman!"
(thor was a little different; felt the family drama dimension made it a bit more interesting).
in recent times, the only films i can honestly say that i have found truly enjoyable have been comic adaptions or simon pegg/nick frost projects.
he's the high water mark of "super villains".
and heath ledger's performance in the dark knight quite simply changed the game.
mr, or is it sir anthony was a fantastic casting, and nothing need be said about his acting here that he is not already laureled for.
@spartacusmars clearly doesn't like anything american, preferring to big up the british end of comics, but as another poster has pointed out, moore's work could only have appeared if it was for american comics money.
3 things from the first 2 superman movies will always stay with me: first is christopher reeves' grief stricken roar at finding louis lane dead.
dark knight is about the most over-rated film ever, by the way... 20 april 2012 9:19am most super hero films have a simple mantra, might is right.
19 april 2012 9:21pm there's huge goodwill among the fans for these characters, devotion even, nay love - it's great that the films have been cast so well, and that everyone involved has understood that at some level 'it matters', and like tom given their all.
find out more inour blog post.
and the actor, helmsworth i think, who played thor did a wonderful job as well...modulating the transition between cockiness (may be a little too well done there) to humility and effortless sacrifice...
as technology has finally caught up with the medium, it has allowed generations of fans to finally see our heroes on the screen as we imagined they would look like, act like, the massive destruction of these heroes and villains in front of our very eyes.
christopher reeve flat out is superman in those movies.
film isn't about capturing the reality of the world, it's about capturing the truth of it.
it sounds cliched, but superheroes can be lonely, vain, arrogant and proud.
i suppose you could take a good many literary characters and fit them into those parameters, but the other half of the effect is how those characters, with all their various gifts and flaws, are able to connect with the intended audience.
the trains just move a lot faster these days.
it was considered an ignoble thing for a classical actor to do.
i hope that they would cheer and delight at the rollercoaster ride through the skies of manhattan at the end ofavengers assemble .
big talk for someone in a silly superhero film, i hear you say.
it's a wonderful moment of screen magic, a wonderful piece of acting from both parties, and we are privvy to this invulnerable impossibly good man at his most vulnerable.
likewise spiderman is usually weaker than whatever villain he is fighting, but usually wins through science.
moreover, the 'good' guys always win, which is nothing like the real world.
10:10am ok, i admit, in my youtube zomboid phase, i watched all the avengers movies...
these films never have shades of grey.
superheroes were always the stories that got the approval of the comics code authority, unlike the horror and true crime tales that came before them.
though, not in leather and metal, spandex and cloaks...mind you, but...these stories, movies, characters and ideas really allow us to think and embrace ourselves as who we are...super.
there was intelligence and humanity that runs all through this film, that i am glad in more than one ways...not being able to sit through more than a part of the vile transformers thing (also on said youtube zomboid phase)
i bet they're glad that there's enough mainstream simpleton 'geeks' lapping up their ideas deficit.
especially the final shot of the first movie.
characters like the green lantern, the flash, wonder woman have always left me completely cold.
the supervillians are more interesting, becuase they are the monsters from the horror comics redressed.
i hope that they would cheer and delight at the rollercoaster ride through the skies of manhattan at the end ofavengers assemble .
it's one of the few film performances i've seen where (again in my humble) the actor is invisible from start to finish.
often they overcome these human frailties for the greater good.
film for them was about capturing and documenting the world.
superman, spiderman, batman, and all the other caped and masked crusaders, are a bunch of one-dimensional vigilante wankmag material for adolescent american teenage males.
ellis, millar, ennis, moore, grant are giants in the field because of the opportunity marvel & dc gave them and long may it continue.
there's not a soul on this earth who hasn't wanted to "hulk smash" something in their lives.
(and i'll admit to fanwanking this into him travelling faster than the speed of light so that things appear to be travelling backwards in time, but that's just my fannish bent).
i thought he was amazing and i believed.
*sniff* 20 april 2012 1:39pm reeve was actually banned from reading comic books as a boy by his strict parents.
ironmonger, abomination, sabretooth are all bigger and physically stronger than ironman, hulk and wolverine.
20 april 2012 1:36pm @mejustnow "i think the fight between spidey and doc oc in spiderman 2 that ranges from skyscrapers to the train is to date the single most spectacular superhero action scene ever.
but here’s the flaw with super hero films, it’s the fact the guys, (and rarely women) are super.
ever, partly because it taught me enough chaos magic to conjour up my beloved sports car...
having no love lost nor lovelorn for the genre, i appreciate a populist movie that is well made just as much an auteur's work.
the message of the films, all problems can be solved via violence and being stronger.
there is a lack of dramatic tension, because at the end of the day, they win, and at worst they’ve dirtied up their spandex.
these scenes are the result of a creative engine set in motion when the lumières shotl'arrivée d'un
he absorbs all these beautiful stories of daring and bravery and heroic adventure, and then decides that he is not living up to the sort of person he believes he could be, so he goes out and literally becomes the author, the creator of his own life, his own adventures!
captain america is a poster boy for martial heroism in military combat: the natural leader, the war hero.
ancient societies had anthropomorphic gods: a huge pantheon expanding into centuries of dynastic drama; fathers and sons, martyred heroes, star-crossed lovers, the deaths of kings – stories that taught us of the danger of hubris and the primacy of humility.
however, tom, i believe, has taken on board what we both felt watching reeve and in doing so, has created a supervillain with solidity and depth.
but superhero films offer a shared, faithless, modern mythology, through which these truths can be explored.
with nothing more than a change in posture reeves transforms before our eyes from clark kent into superman, with no whizz-bang or special effects.
iron man 2 and captain america were truly terrible and avengers looks like more of the same.
