which is what made all those black plastic-wrapped comics smeared with bloody ses instant fishwrap—beyond the fact that it was a wretched, wretched comic: no one with half a brain could believe that this, this was the death of superman.
he lives to see the return of good king richard and is finally killed by a woman, firing a last arrow to mark the place where he shall be buried.
what's fun to watch (from a distance) is how the comic books know it, in their bones.
the later events of the various continua won't make much difference to them.
i skipped most of the last 1000 or so pages of _cerebus_ (though i did read the last 3 or 4 issues, to see how it all came out), so i missed out on the scene he's describing.
i had to come up with a super-nice character to be jaka's husband.
they know they have to make a gesture at an ending of some sort, which usually takes the form of clearing the decks, rebooting, getting back to basics, the core of the character(s).
by contrast, peter david's very long, very high-quality run on the hulk was succeeded by... same old, same old.
i appreciate the humor of having a satanic figure called the infinity worm who turns out, after all, to be a little bitty worm, ergo a mr. mind/satan in the garden mash-up homage, who exits by popping through a mousehole: just a funny visual: "feets don't fail me now!"

it is truly a line worthy of the rude mechanicals, and it is very interesting that something written this badly could have so much resonance - for relative aristos like michael chabon, dave sim, harlan ellison.
the whole business with the christian symbolism of the branch...
an essential quality of a legend is that the events in it are clearly defined in time; robin hood is driven to become an outlaw by the injustices of king john and his minions.
(this tied in nicely with what i saw as oscar wilde's secular humanist messianic pretensions: when he would entertain his enraptured host and hostess and their guests at upper crust dinners, he sincerely thought that he was imparting the equivalent of jesus' parables, that jesus was a poet and a storyteller just like himself— a forerunner of john lennon's blasphemous notion that "the beatles were more popular than jesus".
indeed, they find it difficult to embrace any of the changes in life that the passage of time brings about for these very same reasons, making them finally less than fully human as well as falling far short of true myth.
if we could invent him today, he would sound more like a high tech unabomber than the dark knight, just like zeus sounds more like an abusive parent nowadays than the eternal father of the universe.
the more i thought of someone who cerebus wouldn't just kill on sight and someone who jaka would stay with longer than a few weeks, i realized that i was talking about someone on the jesus level of the niceness scale—in the bland, secular-humanist, feminized sense that the historical jesus is understood (or, rather, misunderstood): that he was this really, really nice feminized guy—so that was what i went with.
(you can use html tags like  and to style your text.)
that is his career, including love interest, major villains and the formation of a superhero group that he is part of.
i had a hell of a time once explaining to my students that most of the classical greeks didn't believe in the gods - or at least didn't believe in a big family of omnipotent horny anthropomorphs atop mount olympus - any more than we believe in superman.
at the time he wrote that, there had really only been secret wars and crisis.
well, i filed this away in my mental rolodex and, when deni and got back from the us tour—we had met harlan at the last stop in colorado—there were three or four comics buyer's guides waiting and while catching up on the news, i also scanned the advertisements to see if anyone was selling a captain marvel adventures no. 27.
the eternal superman is already pretty much set in stone.
—except leave out all the dull onshore bits that would be too expensive to shoot anyway.
but, contrary to the image he cultivated later on, here moore seems to have a very good head for the business side of mainstream comics and a good sense of how to work together with lots of other writers who have ongoing books and plotlines of their own.
the future will edit the rest into something digestable and integrate it into high school curricula.

there've been lots of usually-mediocre comics set in gaiman's universe (plus some wonderful tim hunter comics), but at least no one has dredged morpheus up again.

"that sounds interesting and even kinda cool, in a whack sort of way.
batman will never manage to unload that dorky boy wonder.
of course superheros can't die, even after they've been killed over and over again.
we'll never get a proper look at wonder woman's breasts.

it was the only way jaka's story would work.
so educate yourselves, so it's all fair use.
very few, if any, of the creators of subsequent mega-crossovers seemed to have the same understanding of how to make them work.

by odd coincidence, just last night i finished the amazing adventures of kavalier and clay, which was very enjoyable, and contains the following passage: for the whole of the fall and winter following his return to the mainland, which joe spent shivering in a rented cabin on the beach at chincotgeague, virginia, with the wind whistling in through the chinks in the clapboard, half-poisoned by the burned-hair smell of an old electric heater, it was only ten thousand old gold cigarettes and a pile ofcaptain marvel adventures (comprising the incredible twenty-four month epic struggle between the captain and a telepathic, world-conquering earthworm, mr. mind)
that had enabled joe to fight off, once and for all, the craving for morphine with which he had returned from the ice.

and then i thought, this really resonates with some comic-book history and with my own history: because the little cartoon snake was so small, he looked like a worm, instead of a snake, and i flashed on the first extended comic-book serial—cerebus' first ancestor in a very real sense—the mr. mind serial in captain marvel adventures (issues 22 to 46)
he wins the tournament in disguise, he falls in love with maid marian and thwarts the sheriff of nottingham.

the only issue of the mr. mind serial harlan ellison has never seen and i wrapped it back up and fedexed it to him. ).
that's how it ends for gods and how it will end for superheros.
marvel's attempt to build a whole new set of characters to play with was a commercial and artistic disaster; i believe they actuallydid bring the new universe to a crashing and noble end, cue bad gaelic singing and gauzy landscapes, but nobody cared.
after all, dkr doesn't actually end with wayne dead.
like the death of phoenix (#137) they got stamped indelibly on my teenage hindbrain, waaaaay back aroud the beginning of the first reagan administration.
you cannot apply it to most comic book characters because, in order to meet the commercial demands of a continuing series, they can never have a resolution.
the trope got used up and mined out rather quickly, and very few of these scenarios have aged well.
much better than the superfriends' lex, with the magenta and green armored union suit.
even alan moore mentions in his treatment how he would dearly like to bring mr. mind back.
you can apply the same paradigm to king arthur, davy crockett or sherlock holmes with equal success.
i think the problem is essentially that whatever artistic merits accrue to having your storeend are inevitably trumped by the fact that there are only so many major characters to kill off dc and marvel combined haven't developed a truly popular major character since...
that way comic books can then come full circle, from something you read surreptitiously when you ought to be reading something educational, hoping the teacher wouldn't see it, to something you are forced to read for school when you would rather be doing something else.
i had to come up with a super-nice character to be jaka's husband.
stan lee & co. ran an exciting (if not quality) shop for years, madly shuffling walnut shells across the table and never once showing the pea.

it's just that i expect in 2104 that lit and crit theory students will be talking about the eternally unsatisfied sexual desires of clark kent and how symbolic it is both of the specifics of social alienation and sexual repression in 20th century america, and about its more eternal message about the curses and benefits of uniqueness and the fragile humanity that underlies even the most heroic of men... or some such schlock.
really, it is the only fitting destiny for them after all they've been put through.

we get to see an ending, a stopping place; but in principle wayne could both put the batsuit back on and die some stupid, stepping-off-a-curb death.
that is his career, including love interest, major villains and the formation of a superhero group that he is part of.
it was the only way jaka's story would work.
no amount of rectifying and editing, no pan-dimensional crises, no open-ended deus-ex-machinas, will ever put it to a proper end.
superman couldn't die, of course: he had an ad campaign with energizer or something at the time (this was before jerry got him the amex gig).
the only issue of the mr. mind serial harlan ellison has never seen and i wrapped it back up and fedexed it to him. ).
the overcomplicated horrors of the the classic superheros' universes will all just fade away as artists die, then readers, then publishers...

in a few generations, there will be a definitive superman, batman, wonder woman, and then spiderman, the hulk, the x-men and all the other greats, which can sit on a shelf somewhere to the right of ovid's metamorphoses and homer's iliad, holding up the section marked "anglo-american classics of the mid to late capitalist period.
the gods were born and lived and died and died again, and died again, and slept around and killed scads of heros, and yet no one ever stopped talking about them, reinventing them, or simply repurposing them to their own ends.
you can apply the same paradigm to king arthur, davy crockett or sherlock holmes with equal success.
he's always going to be the secret immigrant powerhouse hiding behind chris reeve's aw-shucks grin and brylcreemed helmet.
that's been done and done and done to death in the comics since then, but it was pretty wild and fresh back then.
anyhow, dofp showed us a nightmare future in which killer robots ruled a post-nuclear world (this was c. 1981, remember), and the only hope of making things right was for one of the few surviving x-men to travel back in time.
beceuase we didn't get twilight with its nice account of a few-decades-long window of time flux we got...

i thought oscar wilde attempting to seduce "jesus" would be a good metaphor for how i saw that part of the historical wilde's story).

gorgeous art, stupid story.
it sometimes seems like, from the perspective of a creator in a shared universe, killing one's lead character is the only way to be sure that he or she won't get stuck on the swamp thing treadmill kip describes.

the green cloak has been picked up by someone else in a crappy comic, but at least jim corrigan's story has been allowed to remain finished (so far, anyways).
they may even cite how critically unaccepted the later supermans - who did get some - were in comparison to the cultural importance of the "classic" superman.
we still don't get to see the great mythic death.
i thought oscar wilde attempting to seduce "jesus" would be a good metaphor for how i saw that part of the historical wilde's story).
again, much as i adore gene hackman in the proper context, he will never be lex luthor; much as i can't stand what little i've seen of the current tv show, that bald, magnetic kid has a lock on my mental picture.
ims the first time was, oooh, probably _days of future past_, claremont & byrne's uncanny x-men #s 142 and 143.
the letters and numbers you entered did not match the image.
no one will ever read superman vs. al qaeda.
i had already figured out the "he/she/it" construct of yhwh and i figured this would be kind of appropriate that the imaginary snake from the garden of eden that had grown to leviathan size turned out to be actually nothing more than a worm, just like mr. mind.

alan moore pulled it off, when he killed swamp thing and left him dead for a couple of issues before dragging him back across space and time, allowing him his spasm of revenge, and then letting him toddle off into the sunset with abby.
those are actually particularly amusing examples, given that lois and clark are married in current continuity (unless something changed while i wasn't looking) and jason todd getting whacked by a bunch of irritated teenage readers is one of the great comic book moments of the '80s.
as to the silly 'what or where' title, i was just struck by the odd poetry of its incompetence.
batman would qualify as a terrorist himself nowadays.
you cannot apply it to most comic book characters because, in order to meet the commercial demands of a continuing series, they can never have a resolution.
moreso, when moore pulled john constantine out of a cult-movie sting performance, and let him disappear with a bad joke.
