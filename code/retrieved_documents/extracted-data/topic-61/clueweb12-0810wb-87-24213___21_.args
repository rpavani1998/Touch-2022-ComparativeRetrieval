as i mentioned in my introduction to frank's dark knight, one of the things that prevents superhero stories from ever attaining the status of true modern myths or legends is that they are open ended.that way comic books can then come full circle, from something you read surreptitiously when you ought to be reading something educational, hoping the teacher wouldn't see it, to something you are forced to read for school when you would rather be doing something else.you cannot apply it to most comic book characters because, in order to meet the commercial demands of a continuing series, they can never have a resolution.of course superheros can't die, even after they've been killed over and over again.but, contrary to the image he cultivated later on, here moore seems to have a very good head for the business side of mainstream comics and a good sense of how to work together with lots of other writers who have ongoing books and plotlines of their own.this license allows copying, derivative works, and commercial use.posting a comment constitutes consent to the following choice of law and choice of venue governing any disputes arising under this licensing arrangement: such disputes shall be adjudicated according to canadian law and in the courts of singapore.they may even cite how critically unaccepted the later supermans - who did get some - were in comparison to the cultural importance of the "classic" superman.it sometimes seems like, from the perspective of a creator in a shared universe, killing one's lead character is the only way to be sure that he or she won't get stuck on the swamp thing treadmill kip describes.i think the problem is essentially that whatever artistic merits accrue to having your storeend are inevitably trumped by the fact that there are only so many major characters to kill off dc and marvel combined haven't developed a truly popular major character since...the overcomplicated horrors of the the classic superheros' universes will all just fade away as artists die, then readers, then publishers...by publishing any comment to this blog, you thereby grant to the proprietors of this blog the right to release any of your comments (made to any blog, at any time, past, present or future) under the terms of the above cc license.indeed, they find it difficult to embrace any of the changes in life that the passage of time brings about for these very same reasons, making them finally less than fully human as well as falling far short of true myth.we get to see an ending, a stopping place; but in principle wayne could both put the batsuit back on and die some stupid, stepping-off-a-curb death.anyhow, dofp showed us a nightmare future in which killer robots ruled a post-nuclear world (this was c. 1981, remember), and the only hope of making things right was for one of the few surviving x-men to travel back in time.
