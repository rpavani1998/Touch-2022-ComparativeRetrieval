it will make a great vacation camera for families, and will not disappoint serious photographers with its controls, ergonomics, or capture dynamic range.with easy creative controls, a wide dynamic range, great autofocus, and a wide selection of available lenses, it’ll make a great vacation camera.nikon’s now established 3d tracking system lets the camera quick track and jump from subject to subject, even as distance from the camera changes drastically.the camera brings welcome innovation to live view and video autofocus and continues to refine nikon’s already best-in-class still capture autofocus.nikon has tackled the problem, at least for now, by making contrast-detection autofocus, the variety that works by analyzing image data collected by the sensor, work better.moving the point manually, which is an easily accessible option and uses the 4-way rocker on the camera’s back, allows a photographer to select a specific point (for example, a portrait subject’s closest eye) and do less focus-and-recompose.autofocus autofocus is, perhaps, the nikon d7000‘s greatest strength when compared to similar cameras from other manufacturers.note: all images for this post were shot with a nikon d7000 and its 18-105mm dx vr kit lens the nikon d7000 is a capable camera, both relatively compact, lightweight, and with a strong feature set.autofocus is, perhaps, the nikon d7000‘s greatest strength when compared to similar cameras from other manufacturers.it can be distractingly eager to focus on things all over the place, which is why nikon allows for it to be disabled.it works flawlessly on the d7000, locking on to whoever may be in front of the camera and keeping things sharp.the camera is able to record clean detail from the brightest of scenes to the shadows.semi-competitor, sony, has addressed this issue by creating cameras with a semi-transluscent mirror that direct some light both to the sensor and the autofocus points (like the a-580 we are reviewing).regardless of the settings used, the camera does a great job with focus.the non-tracking af-s (auto focus-single-servo) works well and is a welcome addition to video capture (especially if you have an external mic, because autofocus is noisy!)
