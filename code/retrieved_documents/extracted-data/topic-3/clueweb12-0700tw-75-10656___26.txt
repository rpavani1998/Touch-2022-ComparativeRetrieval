here's a clear demonstration of the improvements both to the sensor and the noise suppression technology found in the 5d mark iii.
this will be particularly useful to fans of hdr photography, and if you don't want to deal with processing hdr images yourself, there's also an in-camera three-shot hdr mode, a first for an eos model.
as well as evaluative, partial, and center-weighted, there's also a tighter  1.5% spot metering mode.
we also choose 1,600 because we like to be able to shoot at least at this level when indoors and at night.
the grip is sized right for the camera body, though somewhat  large for small hands; it fit my medium-sized hands comfortably.
the remaining points are horizontal line-types,  sensitive to f/5.6.
this refers to a built-in database that allows automatic correction of both spherical and chromatic aberration, astigmatism, curvature of field, diffraction, and low-pass filter effects.
canon 5d mark iii versus canon 5d mark ii iso 1,600 canon 5d mark iii at iso 1,600 canon 5d mark ii at iso 1,600 your eyes can see clearly the benefit of the 5d mark iii over the mark ii,  particularly in the mosaic image.
the 5d mark iii uses a new bg-e11 battery grip, which includes a duplicate multi-controller for portrait shooting.
nikon's 24 megapixel d3x turns the previous assessment on its head a bit, as the d3x probably picks up a bit more detail than the 5d mark iii.
canon 5d mark iii demonstration videos we shot some videos to illustrate the canon 5d mark iii's various new  features, as well as a video of how the canon 600ex rt's radio flash works with  the 5d mark iii.
that didn't match the contours of the thumb.
the mode dial has a central locking button, as seen on the 60d. (this was  also available as an option on the 7d and 5d mark ii, but here it's the  default.)
we'll go over the other features in more  detail below, but the canon 5d mark iii also includes a 150,000-cycle shutter  rating; a new hdr mode; full hd, 1080p video at 24, 25, and 30 frames per  second; a 3.2-inch, 1.04m-dot lcd; a new cmos sensor with higher sensitivity  and an eight-channel readout that allows a 6-frame-per-second frame rate; a  quick control dial that includes touch capability for silent adjustments while  in video mode; multiple raw image sizes; 100-percent viewfinder coverage with  an adjustable lcd grid and af overlay; a 1.5 percent spot meter; a dual-axis  leveling system; and standard or quiet operation modes.
the mosaic crop is noticeably sharper, and the pink swatch has  excellent detail, and the red leaf swatch is pretty respectable.
recent advances in sensor technology have made iso 1,600 look a lot more like iso 100, but there are still cameras whose quality starts to fall apart at this setting.
the d4 image is a bit grainier, however, particularly in the shadows.
canon 5d mark iii versus sony a77 at iso 3,200 canon 5d mark iii at iso 3,200 sony a77 at iso 3,200 noise and noise suppression continue to mar the sony a77's images at iso  3,200, with a slight loss of color as well.
interestingly--and unsurprisingly--the d4  does a little better with the red leaf swatch at iso 100, but misses the  texture of the pink swatch beneath.
there's also a dual-axis level display, similar to that of the eos 7d. in playback mode, you can now process raw images in-camera, and take advantage of the lens correction functions when doing so.
like the 1d x, there's a 3.2-inch clear view ii lcd panel with a high  resolution of approximately 1,040,000 dots.
compression choices are all-i  intraframe or ipb interframe, with embedded free-run or rec-run timecode.
canon expects to ship the 5d mark iii in the us market from the end of  march 2012.
for video mode, the upper limit is capped at iso 25,600 equivalent.
finally, the new speedlite 600ex-rt costs us$630 or thereabouts, and the  new st-e3-rt transmitter is priced at approximately us$470.
all three accessories ship from april 2012.
as well as the previously-mentioned microphone and headphone jacks, the 5d  mark iii also offers up a pc sync terminal, combined standard-def av output /  usb 2.0 high speed port, wired remote control port, and high-def hdmi video  output.
the full auto mode has been upgraded, and canon says it will now do a better job of recognizing the appropriate scene type.
the 5d mark iii's image is  crisp compared to the grainy and soft 7d at iso 1,600.
menu and info buttons are well-placed on the upper left side of the lcd.
lower left of the lcd are three holes for the speaker, and a small window for the ambient light sensor, used to automatically adjust the lcd backlight.
there's more contrast and sharper detail.
we shot some videos to illustrate the canon 5d mark iii's various new features, as well as a video of how the canon 600ex rt's radio flash works with the 5d mark iii.
even if they were playing a bit of catch-up, it seems we can say they've caught up quite well.
this full-color metering allows better subject detection, information which is also fed back to the autofocus system to further aid subject tracking.
four different processing effects are available.
the size and shape of the canon 5d mark iii is similar to the mark ii, only a little heavier.
the 7d's 63-zone  dual-layer metering system reappears in the canon 5d mark iii, instead of the  1d x's 100,000-pixel rgb sensor.
this refers to a built-in  database that allows automatic correction of both spherical and chromatic  aberration, astigmatism, curvature of field, diffraction, and low-pass filter  effects.
two reduced-resolution raw modes are also available, providing 10.5 or 5.5 megapixel resolution.
five buttons left of the lcd are  creative style, a new rate button, a zoom button, and finally the playback and  delete buttons.
as if to underscore the advantage of full frame and canon's recent advancement, the canon 7d's iso 3,200 images are even fuzzier, seen as if through frosted glass by comparison.
the exception is the red leaf swatch, which while somewhat cartoonish in the 5d mark ii's rendering, is softer from the 5d mark iii.
the control cluster on the back of the canon 5d mark iii resembles the 7d  more than the 5d mark ii.
this can be  approximately doubled by shooting with two packs, using the bg-e11 battery grip.
the movie record/live view control includes a switch to select between modes, and a button to either start and stop movie recording or to start and stop live view mode.
as well as supporting new features of the camera, it adds a digital lens optimizer function for still images.
an external gp-e2 gps receiver connects to the camera via usb, and mounts  on the hotshoe or off-camera.
your eyes can see clearly the benefit of the 5d mark iii over the mark ii, particularly in the mosaic image.
there's also a dual-axis level display, similar to that of the eos 7d. in playback mode, you can now process raw images in-camera, and take  advantage of the lens correction functions when doing so.
the 5d mark iii has slightly improved contrast and certainly more resolution.
the self-timer lamp moves up to its usual  position, and the monaural microphone moves from below to above the eos 5d logo.
canon 5d mark iii versus nikon d4 at iso 3,200 canon 5d mark iii at iso 3,200 nikon d4 at iso 3,200 the nikon d4, by comparison, does quite a bit better, with a similar, if  smaller, rendition of the mosaic tile, and a better version of the red leaf  swatch.
the top deck includes a mode dial with the auto+ mode, combined from  the creative auto and green zone modes on the 5d mark ii.
the superior resolution of the sony a77 is lost a bit to noise suppression  in the smaller sensor, particularly noticeable in the shadows and the dark  mosaic background.
canon 5d mark iii versus nikon d3x at iso 3,200 canon 5d mark iii at isoÂ 3,200 nikon d3x at iso 3,200 images from the d3x are quite a bit grainier, but again the image is very  even across disparate elements.
the nikon d4, by comparison, does quite a bit better, with a similar, if smaller, rendition of the mosaic tile, and a better version of the red leaf swatch.
on the top deck, you can now assign the multi-function button to instantly switch between raw and jpeg shooting with a single press.
for video mode, the  upper limit is capped at iso 25,600 equivalent.

even so, keeping with canon tradition, many buttons have shuffled around, and new ones created.
interestingly, as well as using the secondary card as an overflow or duplicate, or to segregate by file type, you can also record different raw or jpeg types to each card.
remote camera triggering is possible from a flash strobe.
that's 1.7 ounces (50g) heavier than the 5d mark ii.
only height and thickness have increased a millimeter or so.
as well as enabling faster 6 fps burst shooting, there's also more power for noise reduction, and canon is predicting a two-stop improvement for jpeg shooting.
the speedlite 600ex-rt allows not only the line-of-sight optical wireless functionality of existing units, but also a new two-way radio connectivity, with 30 meters / 98.4 feet range.
the speedlite 600ex-rt allows not only the line-of-sight optical wireless  functionality of existing units, but also a new two-way radio connectivity,  with 30 meters / 98.4 feet range.
the 5d mark iii's viewfinder now has 100% coverage and a 22mm eyepoint,  both slightly upgraded from the previous model.
it's still a decent performance from the a77, but the 5d mark iii clearly has an advantage.
the quick control dial turns with its normal coarse click  stops, but in movie mode it also responds to touch for making silent  adjustments whose noise won't appear in the audio track.
as well as supporting new features of the camera, it adds a  digital lens optimizer function for still images.
so you get sharper, blur-free shots with all the ambiance intact, without using the flash.
you can also opt to have the source images saved along with the hdr  shot, so if you're not satisfied with the result achieved in-camera, you can  reprocess the hdr on your computer.
the greater performance is also used to add real-time chromatic  aberration correction for both still and movie shooting.
here again it's a mixed bag, with the 5d mark iii showing more crisp detail with higher contrast, but the d3x showing an overall more even appearance regardless of the nature of the element.
of the latter, five will work as  high-precision points to f/2.8.

the quick control dial turns with its normal coarse click stops, but in movie mode it also responds to touch for making silent adjustments whose noise won't appear in the audio track.
canon's digic 5+ processor first appeared in the 1d x. although the 5d mark iii uses only a single processor, canon says it's 17 times more powerful than the mark ii's digic 4 chip.
of the latter, five will work as high-precision points to f/2.8.
a 'silent' shooting mode reduces operation noise, but reduces  burst-shooting speed to three frames per second.
as in that camera, there are 41 cross-type points, of which 20 work to f/4.0, and 21 are f/5.6 capable.
among the user requests that canon has heard and answered with the 5d mark iii, there's now a side-by-side comparative playback display (including synced magnification and a histogram function), plus the ability to manually set the first four characters of image file names.
the  canon 5d mark iii raises the game in terms of overall camera performance, from  frame rate to autofocus, while increasing the resolution only slightly (by just  over a million pixels to 22.3-megapixels).
as well as 1080p 24/25/30 fps and vga 25/30 fps, there's now a 720p 50/60 fps mode.
alongside the 5d mark iii, canon has launched a new flagship flash strobe.
although resolution is almost unchanged, it now features eight-channel readout, gapless microlenses, and boasts improvements in transistor structure and on-chip noise reduction that should yield improved image quality, even for raw shooters.
otherwise,  it's not a huge change at iso 100 from the 5d mark ii.
the advantage to a full frame sensor over an aps-c-sized sensor is quite clear without my calling out why in these shots.
the 5d mark ii's images look downright hazy by comparison.
while the 5d mark iii has  slightly better detail in higher contrast subjects, the d4 renders the  troublesome red swatch as if it were no problem at all.
the remaining points are horizontal line-types, sensitive to f/5.6.
the full  auto mode has been upgraded, and canon says it will now do a better job of  recognizing the appropriate scene type.
the canon 5d mark iii's image is quite smooth, though, offering very similar levels of detail.

the thumbgrip on the right is a little better than on the 5d mark ii, with  a more comfortable taper down the length of the back, rather than a simple arc
there's also a new st-e3-rt transmitter, similar to the existing st-e2, but with support for the new two-way radio system.
the self-timer lamp moves up to its usual position, and the monaural microphone moves from below to above the eos 5d logo.
the bg-e11 grip is priced at around us$490, and the wft-e7a wireless file transmitter at about us$850.

noise and noise suppression continue to mar the sony a77's images at iso 3,200, with a slight loss of color as well.
the 5d mark iii takes the same lp-e6 battery pack as the 5d mark ii,  letting you save a little money if you're planning on upgrading from the older  model, but have a stack of batteries on hand.
a 'silent' shooting mode reduces operation noise, but reduces burst-shooting speed to three frames per second.
the grip is sized right for the camera body, though somewhat large for small hands; it fit my medium-sized hands comfortably.
canon says that video moire has been greatly reduced since the 5d mark ii.
the lcd itself is a 3:2 aspect ratio design that's just as gorgeous as recent models have been, with a 1.04-million dot array.

the 5d mark iii takes the same lp-e6 battery pack as the 5d mark ii, letting you save a little money if you're planning on upgrading from the older model, but have a stack of batteries on hand.
just like the  1d x, you can combine up to nine frames into a single exposure in-camera.
there's a new wft-e7a wireless file transmitter that also supports the eos 7d and 60d, and includes 802.11a/b/g/n wi-fi and gigabit ethernet.
canon's 5d mark iii indeed looks quite improved over the 5d mark ii, despite the slightly smaller pixel pitch.
the 5d mark iii does well against sony's 24-megapixel a77, though we found the a77 to be a little less sharp than the nex-7.
we also choose 1,600 because we like to  be able to shoot at least at this level when indoors and at night.
the superior resolution of the sony a77 is lost a bit to noise suppression in the smaller sensor, particularly noticeable in the shadows and the dark mosaic background.

an external gp-e2 gps receiver connects to the camera via usb, and mounts on the hotshoe or off-camera.
the 7d's 63-zone dual-layer metering system reappears in the canon 5d mark iii, instead of the 1d x's 100,000-pixel rgb sensor.
two minor elements are moved on the front of the canon 5d mark iii: the infrared port is now on the grip (where you'll find it on most every other canon digital slr with the feature), and the depth-of-field preview button has moved to the grip-side of the body.
right of the lcd the controls are nearly all 7d, except for the new, more  logical position of the quick menu button, just upper left of the quick control  dial.
the canon hs system takes the frustration out of low-light photography.

rather than silkscreen the logo next to the button, canon's  eliminated the doubt and put the logo right on these buttons.
the mark iii's 61-point autofocus sensor is also borrowed from the eos 1d  x.
though we normally start with iso 1,600 here, we thought we'd start with the base iso to show the best each camera can do.
sensitivity ordinarily ranges from iso 100 to 25,600 equivalents, and can  be expanded to encompass iso 50 to 102,400 equivalents.
that's 1.7 ounces (50g)  heavier than the 5d mark ii.
the movie record/live view control includes a switch to select between  modes, and a button to either start and stop movie recording or to start and  stop live view mode.
it also shapes up well against nikon's 24-megapixel d3x, an impressive feat.
the canon retains more of the vibrant color in the red swatch, and its rendering of the pink swatch has more detail and gets the color closer to correct, while the a77 makes it look more purple.

below are crops comparing a beta-level canon 5d mark iii to the canon 5d mark ii, canon 7d, nikon d4, nikon d3x, and sony a77.
the 5d mark iii also adopts canon's q button, just to the right of the lcd, for quick-control functions.
menu and info buttons are  well-placed on the upper left side of the lcd.
here again it's a mixed bag, with the 5d mark iii showing more crisp detail  with higher contrast, but the d3x showing an overall more even appearance  regardless of the nature of the element.
the 5d mark iii's power switch juts out from beneath this dial, as it does from the canon 7d as well.
dimensions are 6.0 x 4.6 x 3.0 inches (152.0 x 116.4 x 76.4mm).
lower left of the lcd are three holes for the speaker, and a small window  for the ambient light sensor, used to automatically adjust the lcd backlight.
there are quite a few significant changes to the 5d mark iii's firmware, as  well.
the system is the result of two technologies: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor that's able to capture more light and canon's digic image processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing, delivering maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas.
today's iso 3,200 is yesterday's iso 1,600 (well, almost), so below are the same crops at iso 3,200.

even so, keeping with canon tradition, many buttons  have shuffled around, and new ones created.
(you can also adjust iso sensitivity, shutter speed, and aperture as the video is captured.)
still, they're pretty close.
although the target market is clearly experienced photographers, the 5d mark iii caters to the occasional time when you want to lend your camera to a less-experienced photographer, perhaps to get in the shot yourself.
there's also a new st-e3-rt transmitter, similar to the existing st-e2, but  with support for the new two-way radio system.
we'll go over the other features in more detail below, but the canon 5d mark iii also includes a 150,000-cycle shutter rating; a new hdr mode; full hd, 1080p video at 24, 25, and 30 frames per second; a 3.2-inch, 1.04m-dot lcd; a new cmos sensor with higher sensitivity and an eight-channel readout that allows a 6-frame-per-second frame rate; a quick control dial that includes touch capability for silent adjustments while in video mode; multiple raw image sizes; 100-percent viewfinder coverage with an adjustable lcd grid and af overlay; a 1.5 percent spot meter; a dual-axis leveling system; and standard or quiet operation modes.
18 to 22 megapixels isn't that large a difference, but it's clear that the 5d mark iii is able to resolve a little more detail.
the 5d mark iii's 63-zone dual-layer ifcl metering sensor was first seen in the eos 7d.
these will be  available alongside the camera itself in march.
although the target market is clearly experienced photographers, the 5d  mark iii caters to the occasional time when you want to lend your camera to a  less-experienced photographer, perhaps to get in the shot yourself.
this will be  particularly useful to fans of hdr photography, and if you don't want to deal  with processing hdr images yourself, there's also an in-camera three-shot hdr  mode, a first for an eos model.
for example, you could save full-res raws on one card, and reduced-res mraws on the other.
of all the additional features,  probably the most important is the new autofocus system, brought over from the  1d x, which in addition to having more points (61) and more cross-type points  (41), covers considerably more of the canon 5d iii's image area, while the af  system of the past two models were brought over from the company's aps-c  cameras, thus covering much less image area in the viewfinder.
like the 1d x, there's a 3.2-inch clear view ii lcd panel with a high resolution of approximately 1,040,000 dots.
the 600ex-rt has a guide number of 60 meters / 197 feet at maximum zoom, and has a zoom range of 20 to 200mm.
recent advances in sensor technology have made iso  1,600 look a lot more like iso 100, but there are still cameras whose quality  starts to fall apart at this setting.
as well as evaluative, partial, and center-weighted, there's also a tighter 1.5% spot metering mode.
as in the eos 7d, there's an on-demand grid function, and you can also display the locations of the 61 focusing points.
the 4gb recording limit is gone, and you can save clips as long as 29  minutes, 59 seconds in all resolutions.
the canon retains more of the vibrant color in the red swatch, and its  rendering of the pink swatch has more detail and gets the color closer to  correct, while the a77 makes it look more purple.
the 5d mark iii retains more fabric texture in the pink swatch at this iso setting, though.
these images are best quality jpegs straight out of the camera, at default settings including noise reduction.
battery life is rated to cipa testing standards at 950 shots with the viewfinder, or 200 shots in live view mode, at 73Â°f / 23Â°c.
just like the 1d x, you can combine up to nine frames into a single exposure in-camera.
canon specs the body weight at 30.3 ounces (860g) body only.

the gp-e2 gps receiver costs around us$390.
canon specs  the body weight at 30.3 ounces (860g) body only.
other additions include a digic 5+ processor, which is said to be 17 times more powerful than the digic 4 processor in the 5d ii.
canon's digic 5+ processor first appeared in the 1d x. although the 5d mark  iii uses only a single processor, canon says it's 17 times more powerful than  the mark ii's digic 4 chip.

the top deck includes a mode dial with the auto+ mode, combined from the creative auto and green zone modes on the 5d mark ii.
as well as enabling faster 6 fps burst shooting, there's also more power  for noise reduction, and canon is predicting a two-stop improvement for jpeg  shooting.
it's still a decent performance  from the a77, but the 5d mark iii clearly has an advantage.
four different processing effects are  available.

although resolution is almost unchanged, it now features  eight-channel readout, gapless microlenses, and boasts improvements in  transistor structure and on-chip noise reduction that should yield improved  image quality, even for raw shooters.
the 5d mark iii's  power switch juts out from beneath this dial, as it does from the canon 7d as  well.
the 5d mark iii's 63-zone dual-layer ifcl metering sensor was first seen in  the eos 7d.
(you can also adjust  iso sensitivity, shutter speed, and aperture as the video is captured.)
the eos 5d mark iii's video functionality is similar to that of the 1d x, but with an important addition: a headphone jack for audio monitoring, useful given the ability to adjust audio levels during recording.

it also has a more rugged shoe mount, and  ships with a gel filter holder and tungsten / fluorescent filters.
this can be approximately doubled by shooting with two packs, using the bg-e11 battery grip.
thanks to its full-frame sensor, there's  no focal length crop.
the mosaic crop is noticeably sharper, and the pink swatch has excellent detail, and the red leaf swatch is pretty respectable.

like its predecessor, the 5d mark iii has a canon ef lens mount, and  doesn't accept sub-frame ef-s lenses.
nikon's 16.2-megapixel d4 took a different approach to full-frame, preferring low res for better low-light performance and higher frame rate in their pro press camera, and it clearly pays off here.
most digital slrs and cscs will produce an excellent iso 100 shot, so we like to push them and see what they can do compared to other cameras at iso 1,600, 3,200, and 6,400.
a 4-digit wireless radio id can be assigned to separate radio networks.
the eos 5d mark iii's body includes weather-sealing to a level said to be  better than that of the 5d mark ii, but not to the same degree as an eos  1-series body like the eos-1d x.

as in the eos 7d, there's an  on-demand grid function, and you can also display the locations of the 61  focusing points.
the thumbgrip on the right is a little better than on the 5d mark ii, with a more comfortable taper down the length of the back, rather than a simple arc that didn't match the contours of the thumb.
sensitivity ordinarily ranges from iso 100 to 25,600 equivalents, and can be expanded to encompass iso 50 to 102,400 equivalents.
the shutter mechanism is rated as good for 150,000 shots, unchanged from the 5d mark ii.
