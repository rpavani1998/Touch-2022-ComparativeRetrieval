it  also has a then "new" metering system with a 63-zone dual-layer  system that gives the user focus and color information to ensure accurate  exposure of pictures even when the lighting is difficult or bad.
by contrast, thenikon d300s has a 12.3 megapixel cmos image sensor.
like the d700 which came before, it also has a multi-controller with a separate button in the centre that you use to start recording movies in live view.
no other nikon digital  camera prior to the d300s was able to do this.

however, even some ardent  nikon enthusiasts will admit that thecanon 7d has the edge,  with its 18 megapixel cmos sensor that offers superb resolution.
this is, in any  case, now a standard feature of nikon digital cameras.
it offers 1.0x magnification and 100% coverage which its predecessor, the eos 50d didn't offer (that model has only 0.95x magnification and 95% coverage).
thenikon, on the other hand, allows 7 fps continuous shooting,  although you can upgrade to 8 fps if you use the optional mb-d10 battery pack.
launched in 2009, several months after thenikon d300s, canon's 7d introduced a new, improved auto-focus system that has a dedicated dual digic 4 processor as well as a different shutter mechanism that enables an unbelievably good 8 fps (frames per second) burst mode.
the settings display screen of the nikon d300s is better than the older d300 (which was launched in 2007).

the idea is that you use one card after the other, for instance writing backups to the second card after saving the photo files; saving raw files to one and jpegs to the other; using one for stills and the other for videos, and so on.
