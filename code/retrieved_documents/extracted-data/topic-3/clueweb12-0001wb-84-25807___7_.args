the nikon d3100's overall image quality is probably slightly better, particularly in low light conditions and at high isos, where it performs exceptionally well for any dslr, let alone an entry-level one.both cameras are fast and accurate in normal point and shoot mode, but both slow down in live view and movie mode.the d3100's system is extremely well thought out, and it is far more advanced than canon's offering.both cameras come with features designed to help first-time dslr users.the d3100 isn't perfect, as i've discussed here, but in terms of image quality and ease of use for beginners, it's pretty unbeatable.the t3 does benefit, however, from the addition of the "q" button, which allows for quick access to the rear control screen (appearing on the lcd screen), and fast changing of most shooting parameters.the t3 does benefit, however, from the addition of the "q" button, which allows for quick access to the rear control screen (appearing on the lcd screen), and fast changing of most shooting parameters.as the users grow more confident, they can progress to the "advanced" mode, which guides users toward either the "aperture priority" or "shutter priority" modes.both cameras are made out of plastic, with the nikon weighing slightly more than the canon t3.i really can't understand why canon has chosen to do this, as it means that iso can't be changed without moving the camera away from the eye.image quality both cameras perform well straight out of the box at their default jpeg settings.beginners guides both cameras come with features designed to help first-time dslr users.the canon t3 has the combination of its "basic+" and "creative auto" modes, which allow users to do things such as controlling the aperture (without having to work though technical terms) or choosing the lighting type (setting white balance).the canon t3 has the combination of its "basic+" and "creative auto" modes, which allow users to do things such as controlling the  aperture (without having to work though technical terms) or choosing the lighting type (setting white balance).the colors on the t3 are perhaps a little more natural than on the d3100, but the nikon's images are sharper than the canon's -- even at base iso settings.
