this means that autofocus will only work with af-s lenses, which are usually more expensive.
with the t3, though, canon has moved the iso button next to the mode dial, away from its usual position on the top of cameras.
both cameras come with features designed to help first-time dslr users.
the canon model is particularly bad, and it's almost impossible to use it at all on autofocus in live mode.
however, a problem with the nikon d3100 is that it doesn't have a built-in af motor.
i'll take a look at the key points on each camera to help you make a more informed decision.
i really can't understand why canon has chosen to do this, as it means that iso can't be changed without moving the camera away from the eye.
as the users grow more confident, they can progress to the "advanced" mode, which guides users toward either the "aperture priority" or "shutter priority" modes.
both cameras are made out of plastic, with the nikon weighing slightly more than the canon t3.
you can assign one of these functions to the customizable function button at the front of the camera, but it's only one button, unfortunately.
the d3100's system is extremely well thought out, and it is far more advanced than canon's offering.
the nikon d3100 definitely feels more substantial in the hand.
the included buttons are nicely laid-out, but maybe that's just because so many obvious ones are missing.
resolution, controls, and body the nikon d3100 is the winner in the resolution stakes, with 14mp compared to the canon's 12mp.
the nikon d3100's overall image quality is probably slightly better, particularly in low light conditions and at high isos, where it performs exceptionally well for any dslr, let alone an entry-level one.
the nikon d3100 is a hard camera to beat, and, while the canon t3 provides close competition, it doesn't quite cut the mustard!
the d3100's system is extremely well thought out, and it is far more advanced than canon's offering.
with guide mode, when the d3100 is used in "easy operation" mode, the user can have the camera choose the required setting for different situations, such as "sleeping faces" or "distant subjects."
any new user to dslrs would be happy with the results.
this means that autofocus will only work with af-s lenses, which are usually more expensive.
image quality both cameras perform well straight out of the box at their default jpeg settings.
the d3100 isn't perfect, as i've discussed here, but in terms of image quality and ease of use for beginners, it's pretty unbeatable.
however, the canon t3 does at least have direct access toiso and white balance on the four-way controller at the back of the camera.
the included buttons are nicely laid-out, but maybe that's just because so many obvious ones are missing.
however, the nikon is slightly more compact in size.
if you're not tied into a system, the choice of cameras can seem bewildering.
the canon t3 has the combination of its "basic+" and "creative auto" modes, which allow users to do things such as controlling the aperture (without having to work though technical terms) or choosing the lighting type (setting white balance).

the t3 does benefit, however, from the addition of the "q" button, which allows for quick access to the rear control screen (appearing on the lcd screen), and fast changing of most shooting parameters.

if i was a new user with no ties to any system, i'd put my money down on the nikon.

the colors on the t3 are perhaps a little more natural than on the d3100, but the nikon's images are sharper than the canon's -- even at base iso settings.
