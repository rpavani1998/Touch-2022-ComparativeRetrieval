4- using the d3100 with 50mm lens and bokeh masters day
testing first hands on:
5- highlighting the nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6g vr & 55-200mm vr af-s f/4-5.6g lenses day
the nikon d3100 was not heavy and with care, my kids could try the camera out.
it fit her hands and she was able  to use it right away.
strangely,  however, i found myself likingthe nikon d3100.
i thought i would have more problems with this camera because i am used to more robust dslr’s cameras, like thenikon d90 or the d7000.
it was easy to put away or hold at your side with ablack rapid rs-7 strap.
if you want to replace a camera like the nikon d40 or d60 this is a camera to look at.
i have used it thoroughly, and had more fun with the nikon d3100 than i thought i would.

families will also love this camera, it is great  for school photo’s, family events and vacations due to its convenient  size.
the camera was extremely practical, light, nimble, and easy to use.
this is it, and it looks good, the nikon d3100.
for folks making the move up to dslr photography this camera is ideal.
i did not like the lcd screen of the camera, i wish it had a screen  protector like thenikon d90 or a fold away screen like the nikon d5000.
folks who just  want a decent camera forphoto walking or street photography, this camera would  fit the niche nicely.
this camera was fantastic for photo walking.

the nikon d3100 is a great camera for educational use.
i want to by my first slr camera, and i cannot choose beetwen nikon d3100 and canon t2i.
with its size, 11 points of autofocus, 95% viewer coverage, great metering, iso capabilities and 14 megapixel cmos dx sensor, it’s a very capable camera .
a new photographer will not always know how to take care of their camera.
i can get it for the same  price with 18-55 kit lens.
i also wish there was an internal motor to autofocus older af (screw-type) lenses.
its ease of use and low cost make it a great tool.
working with kids was fun too.

folks who just want a decent camera forphoto walking or street photography, this camera would fit the niche nicely.
for foodies this is a great camera to take to a restaurant.
with its size, 11 points of autofocus, 95% viewer  coverage, great metering, iso capabilities and 14 megapixel cmos dx sensor,  it’s a very capable camera .
it is  something that is learned.
will be on your list.
final thoughts i thought i would have more problems with this camera because i am used to  more robust dslr’s cameras, like thenikon d90 or the d7000.

when i had my first  hands-on i had hopes for this camera.
my wife really liked the size of the camera.
my old canon powershot s3is has a fold away screen  and that is one of the reasons i let my 3-year take photos with it.
must admit that i’m a beginner and i saw in live both cameras and like nikon better only for it’s size (because it’s smaller) but friend told me that canon t2i is better camera.
