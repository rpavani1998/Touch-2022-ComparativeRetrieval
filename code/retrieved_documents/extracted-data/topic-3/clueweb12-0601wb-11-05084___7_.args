it is incredible to me how both manufacturers continue to be able to add more and more photosites without sacrificing image quality at high iso settings.this speaks well for both canon and nikon and the future of image quality improvements in the full frame format.it has a superior body build and a better autofocus system to mention just two.i expect both manufacturers will be able to pull even more out of sensor designs at this size as technology continues to move forward.the images above again illustrate how clean shooting at iso 1600 has become for both nikon and canon shooters.all canon camera settings are identical using either the canon 85mm (f/1.8 or f/1.2l) lens in aperture priority at f/1.8 or the canon 50mm f/1.4 lens at f/1.8 with auto white balance on.iso 6400 winner: iso 6400 is now immenently usable for many photo applications.moncler women jackets can be easily recognized due to unique style and signature logo label.winner: the nikon d3x and canon 5d mkii still exhibit the trademark differences in auto white balance performance.additionally, the canon 5d mkii occassionally exhibits very light, but visible, banding at this high iso.the nikon images were shot using the nikkor 85mm f/1.4 lens at f/1.8 using auto white balance.of course, there is much more to making images than just final image quality.canon awb tends to run a bit magenta under tungsten lighting while nikon tends toward yellow.these cameras are available (depending on stock) from these trusted sources, and in ourpro store: canon eos 5d mark ii (body only) - amazon canon eos 5d mark ii camera with ef 24-105mm f/4 l is usm lens - amazon nikon d3x 24.5mptaking pictures of the family pet sometimes takes - well - the family to get it done.
