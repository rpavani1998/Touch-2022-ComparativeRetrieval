it appears that any object that reflects near ir has a tendency  to run up the blue channel response in the d2h, which in turn makes for slight  color shifts and increased noise.
a new en-el4 lithium battery is used, and we can see exact battery life  remaining.
the bottom line remains the same, however: nikon has produced a sensor of their own design, and it's competitive with other technologies.
about the only thing i could find that draws down the battery quickly is very long bulb exposures or tethered use.
handling nikon is learning.
drawbacks potentially long reach for small hands.
in particular, if you hold the camera primarily using the front grip, you'll find the thumb reach to the autofocus direction pad is a little long.
the d2h feature set is essentially state-of-the-art.
in a  perfect world we want both (more resolution and more acuity), but in the real  nikon world we have one or the other.
nikon disclaims all but blower bulb cleaning, and you can't clean without an ac adapter.
other than screen doors and a few fabrics, i haven't seen any moire that i'd worry about, though.
the d2h is not a camera you can shoot at anything other than proper exposure.
nef and jpeg files can be written simultaneously for each image, and you  can choose the size and quality of the jpeg file to be written.
that alone should send shivers down sony's spine, as now the four  leaders in dslr sales, canon, kodak, fujifilm, and nikon all have sensor  technology of their own.
message to nikon: stop sprouting new batteries and chargers like weeds, and standardize on one or two.
on the flip side, the silly camera end cap is a detail i could have lived without.
and they all interact with a couple of custom settings, which control the release-priority versus focus-priority choice, and the pattern that's used in group dynamic af.
white balance itself is measured via a dedicated incident sensor at the front of the viewfinder.
it's easily the equivalent of anything nikon has done in the past, and, if i'm evaluating my images correctly, maybe even better up to a point.
if you learn where all the controls are, there's no reason  to take your eye from the finder, exactly the way you want a camera designed  for action photography.
personally, i hoped for "better," but i never quantified  that in my mind.)
first, it's smaller than the en-4 that was in the d1 series.
batteries charge modestly fast.
one handling aspect that's welcomed is the new information in the viewfinder.
even a five-minute exposure seems free of hot pixels and obvious dark current noise, though bringing up shadow detail reveals that there's some there.
the af-on and ae-l buttons have been slightly offset at a diagonal so that they're easier to distinguish from one another (the af-on is the upper button).
i consider this excellent performance.
nikon has  built the slr hammer for the 21st century (the f being the original 20th  century slr hammer).
the voice  annotation button is deeply recessed (you have to really want to use it to  access it--thus you don't accidentally waste space recording noise due to  accidental pressing).
we need individual channel histograms as an option.
note that flash emits a great deal of near ir  and ir light, and i've indeed run into the problem more often indoors using  flash than elsewhere.
that's just the way it should be.
indeed, nikon's noise reduction techniques seem relatively  simple (dark current substraction, etc.) compared to canon's.
this particular sensor is designed for speed.
some folk were simply expecting a camera that blew away all previous dslrs in terms of noise (e.g., a camera that performed at iso 1600 the way others do at iso 100).
color integrity is usually excellent, just as it has been with previous  nikon dslrs, but with one caveat, which i'll get to in a moment.
with the wrong card, it's merely mid-pack to fast.
the details of this addition are too varied and complex to  describe in this review; i'll have more to say in my review of the sb-800,  which is required to implement the new flash system.
recommended, if you need a dslr that can handle action, the d2h will have you covered.
as noted earlier,  expectations were sky-high after nikon's hype at the d2h launch.
announced in late summer 2003, it didn't begin to ship until november 2003.
more often than not the green bias shows up in  shaded areas--if a subject is well and evenly lit and you've set the white  balance correctly, this problem isn't present.
the camera even tracks battery charges and recommends when new ones  should be obtained!
unfortunately, if you have smallish hands, as i do, you'll find some of the  positions of controls are wrong.
several charges from under 30% power remaining have taken just a bit under 90 minutes; nikon claims about a 100 minute full charge time, and i've yet to have any charge go that long.
you have a choice of three color spaces, and the srgb and adobergb spaces seem accurate in my early testing, again with some caveats (see end of paragraph and next paragraph).
since white balance is easier to master on this camera than previous nikon dslrs, it all adds up to getting solid color results for those paying attention.
custom white balance can be done from a gray card or the incident white balance  meter in the camera.
personally, i do prefer edge acuity over  resolution, but i also don't produce large fine art prints from my work.
and that's not even considering that i need to carry yet  another set of batteries and charger for my aa's used in the flash units.
you won't be able to get  away with such cavalier design long term.
this is not "some new features in a d1 package" type of  design.
custom settings have been grouped in a meaningful way, getting rid of the  old scroll-through-30+-functions method of locating what you want to set.
lines are clean, markings are clear, and there's less of impromptu design feel to it than we had in the d1 series.
one disappointment to nef shooters  is that the buffer is no more than 16 images in size when noise reduction is on  (14 when shooting compressed nef with jpeg), 25 with it off.
some of the stuff is minor (like the grouped  and named custom settings), but it still adds up to making an already flexible  camera even more so.
some show the active sensor in the display, some don't.
that's certainly not true in the  horizontal axis, but people are interpreting sharp-appearing d2h images as  having more resolution than anti-aliased d1x images, which is wrong.
but it still provides some flexibility that wasn't on previous models.
well weatherproofed, nothing sticking  out to get clipped off in abusive handling, controls that are designed for use  with gloves, magnesium alloy body with padding in the right places.
and that's not even considering that i need to carry yet another set of batteries and charger for my aa's used in the flash units.
i first noticed this when i was trying to photograph some of my mom's paintings for her.
still, an unsharpened d2h image set next to the same number of pixels from a d100 or d1x simply looks like it has the more detail due to the acuity produced by the thinner low pass filter.
indeed, even in shots of birds and other animals with fine feathers or hairs i haven't seen color fringing or moire.
a second color problem took me longer to recognize: in some situations the  camera has a green bias that can be ugly (see the software section in my ebook  for a full example of this).
no longer do you have to guess whether the half-full battery indicator means you're about to have a dead battery or you've still got some life left in it.
overall, yes, near ir response is  down (bjorn rosslett reports that it's two stops different than the d100; it  doesn't quite seem that much with the filter i use, but itis a  noticeable difference).
whether this blue channel problem is limited to some camera bodies or is there for all d2h's made to date is unclear; many of us early users have encountered this problem, but others claim they haven't seen it.
in particular, nikon has  used a thinner, less aggressive low pass (anti-aliasing) filter.
the d2h's sensor is a new design from a new  player in sensor design, and has a high bar to get over just to achieve parity  with other sensors that are several generations old.
personally, i hoped for "better," but i never quantified that in my mind.)
most of the translations i saw--and the comments made by nikon  officials at the us and european launchs--led everyone to believe that the  claim was "the pixels from a d2h will be lower in noise than any existing  camera."
this  particular sensor is designed for speed.
on the flip side, the large number of buttons required for a digital body  are all well marked, large, and nicely recessed on the d2h.
essentially, you have to "assemble" the end cap and battery every time you change batteries.
third, you get relatively  accurate charge remaining information, should you need it.
new controls, more options, and  improved user control all around.
battery performance is superb.
second, the fact  that nikon uses dual-channel processing on the chip is what gives the camera
unfortunately we get new battery chargers and ac adapters  because of this.
if i want to carry a d2h and another nikon body as backup, i now have to carry two sets of batteries, two sets of battery chargers, and two sets of ac adapters (to allow sensor cleaning).
i'd like even more control over the patterns used by the autofocus sensors  (e.g., "detect only horizontal motion").
flash is much better with i-ttl than it is with d-ttl, and you have more  control and multiple flash ttl with the new system.
one potential problem with nikon's decision on the filter: there will be a stronger tendency to produce color moire patterns on fine, repeating detail; this is not a camera destined to for serious fashion shoots, imho.
so the trade-off is better  detail at the expense of potential moire.
i've seen others on the internet already start incorrectly making the comment that the d2h's resolution is higher than the d1x's.
white balance itself is measured via a dedicated incident sensor at the front  of the viewfinder.
the af-on and ae-l buttons have been slightly  offset at a diagonal so that they're easier to distinguish from one another  (the af-on is the upper button).
[here at the end of 2004, a few cameras are starting to catch up; but the d2h  still remains state-of-the-art, which is saying something for a camera that's  been out for more than year.]
the final performance issue everyone wants to know about is one i'm not yet  fully comfortable with writing in detail about: noise.
that's not to say that it performs poorly, though.
if nikon targeted action  shooters with this camera (they did), they hit a bull's eye.
while some might ask for more megapixels, i'm willing to wait for a d2x  based upon the same design that trades speed for resolution.
i just wish they'd learn faster.
that's not my take after re-reading the japanese slides and press accounts of the launch in tokyo.
i'll not repeat the full list of features here, but instead point out some of the things that are changed or added from the d1 series: on this last point i must criticize nikon severely: traveling photographers--of which i'm most certainly one--already have to cope with carrying more equipment after the transition to digital.
custom settings banks can be named, making it easier to remember what's different about bank b than bank a.
not only will you know how many shots are left on your card (or how many you've taken), but you can see white balance settings, iso, image quality settings, and more.
excellent 4mp image quality.
one aspect of noise i can report on with positive results is long-exposure  noise.
less obvious than all the external changes is the sensor, buried deep in the all-black body.
first off, let me say that this is a stylish body design.
coupled with a shutter  release lag of as little as 37ms, this has got to be the fastest (non-pellicle)
i'm adjusting  that slightly: while the overall amount of near ir that is usable in ir imagry  is less, there appears to be an abnormal blue channel response that contributes  to noise and color shift, as noted above.
if you have large hands (can get more than an octave spread on the piano) or are shooting with gloves, these positions are less problematic, but be forewarned: nikon isn't designing for small hands.
sensor cleaning is no different with the new model than previous.
other than screen doors and a few  fabrics, i haven't seen any moire that i'd worry about, though.
a new flash technology has been added, which nikon's schizophrenic  marketing department can't quite decide whether to call i-ttl or cls (creative  lighting system).
others on the  net have noted that use of a hot mirror filter (filters out near ir) changes  the camera's noise and color tendencies with certain fabrics and objects.
the autofocus area mode selector (hey i don't make these names up) is going to confuse many, however, at least at first.
even a one stop underexposure will bring up the noise level, and two stops will make it noticeably visible.
i can't imagine a situation where i'd need more than two batteries for a day's shoot, though there may be a few prolific photojournalists out there that disagree.
well, we need to peel those folk down from the ceiling and get them off the drugs they're using.
but you have to learn the nuances to get the most from it,  especially since both the group dynamic autofocus and default autofocus  positions re-introduce closest subject priority as an option.
and  then you may find that you don't have enough megapixels for really large print  sizes (i'm getting spoiled by thekodak pro 14n's prodigious pixel creation).
in particular, nikon has used a thinner, less aggressive low pass (anti-aliasing) filter.
several charges from under 30% power remaining have taken  just a bit under 90 minutes; nikon claims about a 100 minute full charge time,
a 10-minute exposure can pull the  battery down 25% or slightly more.
if you accidentally leave the camera on overnight with a full battery, the camera still claims ~87% battery charge 24 hours later, and that figure seems accurate.
but with a wa enabled card or other state-of-the-art card, write performance on the d2h is faster than any dslr i've encountered to date, and by a fairly comfortable margin.
even a one stop  underexposure will bring up the noise level, and two stops will make it  noticeably visible.
the fact that people are asking for even more shows you just how far digital cameras are moving.
the autofocus area mode selector (hey i don't make these  names up) is going to confuse many, however, at least at first.
second, it doesn't have any exposed contacts,  so you don't have to worry about putting that little plastic end cap on when  you stick multiple batteries into a pack or pocket.
acuity is good,  color is excellent, and noise performance is at least as good as previous  nikons, if not better.
edge acuity is pretty darned good, though it comes with a minor caveat (potential moire).
on this last point i must criticize nikon severely: traveling  photographers--of which i'm most certainly one--already have to cope with  carrying more equipment after the transition to digital.
even so, iso 1600 and even 3200 are quite usable with post production noise reduction--the primary loss is one of color saturation and contrast, not detail.
indeed, nikon's noise reduction techniques seem relatively simple (dark current substraction, etc.) compared to canon's.
a nice step forward overall.
indeed, if you shoot less than 500 images in a session, you'll probably do fine with just one battery.
i wish the reach to the  autofocus direction pad was better for my hands, but even though i have to  stretch to reach it, i still like this system a lot.
this means  that the capture acuity is actually visibly higher on the d2h than it is on the  d1x.
specifically, that it had the low-power and direct addressing characteristics of cmos and the low-noise and dark current properties of a ccd.
second, it doesn't have any exposed contacts, so you don't have to worry about putting that little plastic end cap on when you stick multiple batteries into a pack or pocket.
if you were confused by single area af versus dynamic area af, you're going to  need to study these new controls--they add a great degree of choice to your  autofocus options, but they are not obviously intuitive, even to veteran nikon  users.
i've  seen others on the internet already start incorrectly making the comment that  the d2h's resolution is higher than the d1x's.
and by very long i meanmeasured in minutes.
buffer could be bigger.
in an earlier iteration of this review i wrote that "near infrared is blocked more on this camera than on previous nikon dslrs."
if i want to carry a  d2h and another nikon body as backup, i now have to carry two sets of  batteries, two sets of battery chargers, and two sets of ac adapters (to allow  sensor cleaning).
that alone should send shivers down sony's spine, as now the four leaders in dslr sales, canon, kodak, fujifilm, and nikon all have sensor technology of their own.
note that acuity is not the same as resolution, however.
one aspect of noise i can report on with positive results is long-exposure noise.
overall, handling aspects have improved slightly from the d1 series  (which was already quite good), though those with small hands need to be aware  that they might be uncomfortable with the reach to the autofocus direction pad  and af-on/ae-l buttons.
every control, every body curve, and even every part deep in the body (frame, shutter, etc.) seems to have been touched.
that's not my take after re-reading the japanese slides and press  accounts of the launch in tokyo.
thus, i didn't really have any clear expectations on how noisy or how un-noisy the d2h images will be.
we'll get to actual sensor performance later in the review, but i do want  to emphasize a couple of things: the fact that this is a jfet chip means that  one of the power-hogs in the d1 series has been eliminated.
but when you've got neutrals in  a shaded areaand a well lit other area, you can easily see it.
the camera can track vertical position and auto-rotate images in nikon  view.
message to nikon: stop sprouting new batteries and  chargers like weeds, and standardize on one or two.
we'll get to actual sensor performance later in the review, but i do want to emphasize a couple of things: the fact that this is a jfet chip means that one of the power-hogs in the d1 series has been eliminated.
in nikon's launch pr, the company made significant claims about this new technology.
(i should perhaps make a comment about nikon's sensor noise comments at the  d2h launch.
and by very  long i meanmeasured in minutes.
okay, that's a bit too extreme a statement, but it sure  seems that way in comparison to the d1 series.
if you're going to get a  d2h, be prepared to get at least one (and probably two) sb-800 speedlights, as  well.
about the only thing i could find that draws down the battery quickly  is very long bulb exposures or tethered use.
thus, i didn't  really have any clear expectations on how noisy or how un-noisy the d2h images  will be.
one handling aspect that's welcomed is the new information in the  viewfinder.
essentially,  you have to "assemble" the end cap and battery every time you change  batteries.
but when you've got neutrals in a shaded areaand a well lit other area, you can easily see it.
once you learn how all the controls interact and find the settings that work for the situations you photograph, you'll find that the new autofocus system is fast, sure, and reliable.
but the blue channel appears to respond to near ir light, which it shouldn't be doing (near ir should all be picked up only in the red channel).
fortunately, the metering system is accurate and flexible, so there's really no excuse for getting exposures wrong.
ironically, canon is one of the few makers of a 77mm hot mirror filter, and nikon doesn't make one.
this is a very typical example of what happens when talented engineers don't pay enough attention to users.
the camera uses usb 2.0 for computer connections and connection to the  optional wt-1 wireless transmitter.
it appears that curves and placement of ridges was more  carefully considered to help handling characteristics.
and if you are having problems with  that, use an sb-800 set up toonly provide af-assist illumination (you  can finally set it up so that no flash triggers).
i'm comfortable in saying  that nikon achieved parity or better, although the exact aspects of that are  the stuff that require much more verbiage to describe accurately, especially  given the near ir issue.
this shows just how much power conservation is going on normally; a lot!
if you have large  hands (can get more than an octave spread on the piano) or are shooting with  gloves, these positions are less problematic, but be forewarned: nikon isn't  designing for small hands.
performance battery performance is superb.
an  11-sensor array covers all but the corners of the image area, and can be  configured to operate in enough different ways to confound even those that  study the manual carefully.
technically, it's nearly a cmos-type sensor (except with jfet instead of mosfet transistors).
the list of possible assignments is shorter than i'd like (you should  be able to assign it to depth of field for the vertical release, for example),
not only will you know how many shots are left on your card (or how  many you've taken), but you can see white balance settings, iso, image quality  settings, and more.
ironically, canon is one of the few  makers of a 77mm hot mirror filter, and nikon doesn't make one.
while the family heritage is obvious, virtually every significant aspect of the camera has been rethought.
be prepared to spend some quality time with a convenient moving subject practicing with the various autofocus settings.
since the launch event, nikon has been quieter about the noise issues, emphasizing the high speed data processing capabilities of the chip more than the noise tendencies.
the reach for the autofocus  direction pad is even greater when holding the camera vertically, and the depth  of field button is no longer reachable without moving your hand position off  the shutter release (one of the reasons why i said the func button needs to  have other options, such as depth of field--you can almost reach that button  from the vertical release with small hands).
i'm impressed that nikon has taken the time to try to improve, refine,  and innovate in as many places as it has.
the list of specification changes or additions i'd ask for is relatively minimal: while some might ask for more megapixels, i'm willing to wait for a d2x based upon the same design that trades speed for resolution.
okay, that's a bit too extreme a statement, but it sure seems that way in comparison to the d1 series.
even so, iso 1600  and even 3200 are quite usable with post production noise reduction--the  primary loss is one of color saturation and contrast, not detail.
even though the d2h has a  dark-frame subtraction noise reduction feature that can be set, i'm not really  seeing the need for it until you get out to very long exposures.
a hot mirror filter does seem to eradicate the problem, at the expense of small light loss overall.
compactflash write performance can be superb.
flexible and controllable.
no more needs to be said.
this means that the capture acuity is actually visibly higher on the d2h than it is on the d1x.
the iso, qual, and wb buttons are larger than on the d1 series, and again nicely recessed yet accessible.
autofocus performance is superb, though requires learning to use well.
it's  easy enough to deal with, but annoying.
but with a wa enabled  card or other state-of-the-art card, write performance on the d2h is faster  than any dslr i've encountered to date, and by a fairly comfortable margin.
the claim that was made is that lbcast chip itself is inherently less noisy than an equivalent cmos sensor.
fast frame rate, fast mirror return, fast shutter  lag, fast autofocus, fast, fast, fast.
now that we have a better battery, i'd like more control over the self  timer settings, especially longer ones.
i will say that the quality of the d2h noise is nice,  at least up to iso 800.
if you  accidentally leave the camera on overnight with a full battery, the camera  still claims ~87% battery charge 24 hours later, and that figure seems  accurate.
second, the fact that nikon uses dual-channel processing on the chip is what gives the camera the ability to run at 8 frames per second.
white balance can be set directly in kelvin values, and white balance now  has its own dedicated sensor at the front of the prism; custom white balance is  simple, can be done in two different ways, and you can save settings with names  you provide.
indeed, if you shoot less than 500  images in a session, you'll probably do fine with just one battery.
[of course, canon countered by updating the 1d, which now has a larger buffer and comes closer to matching the length of the d2h's burst.]
speaking of the viewfinder, the blackout time during shots is so minimal  that you'll easily be able to follow action at 8 fps.
it's easily the equivalent of anything nikon has done in the past, and,  if i'm evaluating my images correctly, maybe even better up to a point.
white balance is more flexible and more easily controlled than before.
connections to the camera (video, ac in, usb 2.0) all attach via connectors on the left side of the camera.
the camera seems to power down gracefully, for example, much like the old film bodies.
as much as the next guy, i'd love to see a breakthrough in image noise tendencies.
fortunately, the metering system is accurate and flexible,  so there's really no excuse for getting exposures wrong.
and if you are having problems with that, use an sb-800 set up toonly provide af-assist illumination (you can finally set it up so that no flash triggers).
with the wrong card, it's merely  mid-pack to fast.
with the right settings and discipline, this camera  performs more like a 5mp or higher camera.
as noted earlier, expectations were sky-high after nikon's hype at the d2h launch.
by that i mean that it is random and more grain-like than the mosaic, banded, and color-blotched noise you often see in digital images.
nikon literature refers to it as a jfet lbcast sensor (junction field effect transistor, lateral buried charge accumulator and sensing transistor array) because that describes the unique design that underlies each photosite.
it's both easy to activate a function as well as not easy to accidentally activate a function.
the wireless transmitter allows 802.11b ftp  transfers from camera to computer at ranges up to 500 feet (with the optional  extension antenna; otherwise 100 feet).
i can't imagine a situation where i'd need more  than two batteries for a day's shoot, though there may be a few prolific  photojournalists out there that disagree.
you won't be able to get away with such cavalier design long term.
this shows just how much power conservation  is going on normally; a lot!
this is not "some new features in a d1 package" type of design.
white balance  settings can be "obtained" from images already on the storage card.
nikon has freed themselves from the sony sensor parade with  this camera, coming up with a new one of their own.
the ability to run at 8 frames per second.
the viewfinder now features additional informational displays--virtually  every significant setting can be seen without taking your eye from the finder.
a second color problem took me longer to recognize: in some situations the camera has a green bias that can be ugly (see the software section in my ebook for a full example of this).
kelvin settings can be set directly (though at pre-determined values).
a new, user-assignable func button has appeared on the front of the  camera.
connections to the camera (video, ac in, usb 2.0) all attach via connectors  on the left side of the camera.
the d2h is a complete redesign from the d1 series cameras.
thus, early grumbling in the various internet digital photography forums all immediately went into a "too little, too late" versus "all that we need" debate.
others on the net have noted that use of a hot mirror filter (filters out near ir) changes the camera's noise and color tendencies with certain fabrics and objects.
overall, yes, near ir response is down (bjorn rosslett reports that it's two stops different than the d100; it doesn't quite seem that much with the filter i use, but itis a noticeable difference).
an interval timer has been added to allow time-lapse and unattended  photography.
color integrity is usually excellent, just as it has been with previous nikon dslrs, but with one caveat, which i'll get to in a moment.
the definitive d2h book is here click here to find out  more.
again, it would be nice to  have 8mp and a bit better noise handling at high iso values, but that's really  about all that's necessary to put the d2h on the top of the heap again.
that's because  some of the selections also add closest subject priority when selected, some  don't.
in a perfect world we want both (more resolution and more acuity), but in the real nikon world we have one or the other.
some other  reviewers have remarked about getting more saturation out of their d2h shots,  but once i make my usual post-processing adjustments i don't see any  significant difference from older nikon dslrs.
as much as the next guy, i'd love to see a breakthrough in image  noise tendencies.
lines are clean,  markings are clear, and there's less of impromptu design feel to it than we had  in the d1 series.
the blue channel seems to  respond to near ir, and a hot mirror filter fixes the problem.
unlike the d1 series, the rubber doors that sit  over these connectors seem to stay closed, and provide a pretty good weather  seal.
more often than not the green bias shows up in shaded areas--if a subject is well and evenly lit and you've set the white balance correctly, this problem isn't present.
that's saying a lot, actually.
if you were confused by single area af versus dynamic area af, you're going to need to study these new controls--they add a great degree of choice to your autofocus options, but they are not obviously intuitive, even to veteran nikon users.
the autofocus, exposure, flash, long-exposure noise, and color saturation performance of this camera are superb.
color accuracy is good with caveats that can be dealt with.
every control, every body curve, and  even every part deep in the body (frame, shutter, etc.) seems to have been  touched.
on the flip side,  the silly camera end cap is a detail i could have lived without.
edge acuity is pretty darned good, though it comes with a minor caveat  (potential moire).
likewise, reaching to hit the af-on or ae-l buttons  with your thumb tends to move your hand position back around the grip, which  means you don't have quite as solid a hold on the camera.
unfortunately, if you have smallish hands, as i do, you'll find some of the positions of controls are wrong.
i-ttl works, and it restores multiple  flash ability.
since the launch event, nikon has been quieter about the noise issues,  emphasizing the high speed data processing capabilities of the chip more than  the noise tendencies.
white balance settings can be named.
is the d2h better than the d1h it replaced?
again, it would be nice to have 8mp and a bit better noise handling at high iso values, but that's really about all that's necessary to put the d2h on the top of the heap again.
the reach for the autofocus direction pad is even greater when holding the camera vertically, and the depth of field button is no longer reachable without moving your hand position off the shutter release (one of the reasons why i said the func button needs to have other options, such as depth of field--you can almost reach that button from the vertical release with small hands).
it's both easy to  activate a function as well as not easy to accidentally activate a function.
but there's a wrinkle in the ointment: things that emit near ir appear to bamboozle the camera in a couple of ways.
the  autofocus, exposure, flash, long-exposure noise, and color saturation  performance of this camera are superb.
custom settings have been grouped in a meaningful way, getting rid of the old scroll-through-30+-functions method of locating what you want to set.
drawbacks top | home
overall, handling aspects have improved slightly from the d1 series (which was already quite good), though those with small hands need to be aware that they might be uncomfortable with the reach to the autofocus direction pad and af-on/ae-l buttons.
for years, we nikon pros have been slowly losing our eyepieces when they rattled out from vibration or whatever; no more.
well,  they're right.
but the blue channel appears to respond to near ir  light, which it shouldn't be doing (near ir should all be picked up only in the  red channel).
even though the d2h has a dark-frame subtraction noise reduction feature that can be set, i'm not really seeing the need for it until you get out to very long exposures.
one small touch that has gone unnoticed in other reviews: the eyepiece won't unscrew unless you first close the viewfinder eyepiece shutter.
the camera seems to power  down gracefully, for example, much like the old film bodies.
since white  balance is easier to master on this camera than previous nikon dslrs, it all  adds up to getting solid color results for those paying attention.
still, an unsharpened d2h image set next to the same number  of pixels from a d100 or d1x simply looks like it has the more detail due to  the acuity produced by the thinner low pass filter.
i wish the reach to the autofocus direction pad was better for my hands, but even though i have to stretch to reach it, i still like this system a lot.
nine of the 11 autofocus sensors are low-light,  low-contrast capable, which makes it hard to find a situation where the camera  won't focus (though it's still possible).
i use the words "can be" because i have encountered a few older cards that don't achieve the fast write performance the d2h is capable of.
a hot mirror filter does seem to eradicate the problem,  at the expense of small light loss overall.
have nikon engineers actuallytraveled with their products?
the two new buttons on the back are a good news, bad news pair.
white balance settings can be "obtained" from images already on the storage card.
the fact that people are asking for even more  shows you just how far digital cameras are moving.
well,  we need to peel those folk down from the ceiling and get them off the drugs  they're using.
indeed, since you can  pull up a histogram with a center press of the autofocus direction pad, make  that pull up the current luminance histogram and then put the channel  histograms on other info pages you browse through.
at high iso values, though, the mosaic rears its head on the d2h, though banding seems pretty well under control on my sample.
finally, since each photosite is directly addressable, noise reduction and other image processing techniques can be performed at the pixel levelprior to passing to a central dsp (digital signal processor), again potentially speeding up operations.
and there nikon didn't make any significant  claims [e.g., they didn't say "our noise reduction techniques are better  than canon's].
third, you get relatively accurate charge remaining information, should you need it.
even a five-minute exposure seems free  of hot pixels and obvious dark current noise, though bringing up shadow detail  reveals that there's some there.
note, however, that both lbcast and cmos absolutely require that you run noise reduction techniques on the photosite data.
it's easy enough to deal with, but annoying.
thus, we have our work cut out just running down the feature set and changes to it.
the color lcd is bigger and brighter than before.
first, it's smaller than the  en-4 that was in the d1 series.
the iso, qual, and wb buttons are larger than  on the d1 series, and again nicely recessed yet accessible.
this  is a big camera, and shooters with small hands won't find all the controls  quite where they want them.
top | home don't forget my quarterly newsletter on dslr issues, supplied on cd.
and i've yet to have any charge go that long.
[here at the end of 2004, a few cameras are starting to catch up; but the d2h still remains state-of-the-art, which is saying something for a camera that's been out for more than year.]
since the battery charge is known, the cleaning mode really should allow  cleaning with a battery (if remaining power is greater than xx%).
that's not to say that it performs poorly,  though.
we're talking about edge definitions, not the size of the edge that can be captured.
the vertical grip continues that problem.
(i should perhaps make a comment about nikon's sensor noise comments at the d2h launch.
it appears that any object that reflects near ir has a tendency to run up the blue channel response in the d2h, which in turn makes for slight color shifts and increased noise.
that's because some of the selections also add closest subject priority when selected, some don't.
custom settings banks can be named, making it easier to remember what's  different about bank b than bank a.
be prepared to  spend some quality time with a convenient moving subject practicing with the  various autofocus settings.
cleaning the ccd i've now posted an article on how to clean the ccd.
i will say that the quality of the d2h noise is nice, at least up to iso 800.
note, however,  that both lbcast and cmos absolutely require that you run noise reduction  techniques on the photosite data.
i'm comfortable in saying that nikon achieved parity or better, although the exact aspects of that are the stuff that require much more verbiage to describe accurately, especially given the near ir issue.
the final performance issue everyone wants to know about is one i'm not yet fully comfortable with writing in detail about: noise.
ai and later manual focus lenses can be used with the matrix meter (after  a bit of data input, and only in aperture-priority and manual exposure modes).
in an earlier iteration of this review i wrote that "near infrared is  blocked more on this camera than on previous nikon dslrs."
custom white balance can be done from a gray card or the incident white balance meter in the camera.
i first noticed this when i was trying to  photograph some of my mom's paintings for her.
while the family  heritage is obvious, virtually every significant aspect of the camera has been  rethought.
the problem, of  course, is that canon's offering, the 1d mark ii, has an 8mp sensor, so nikon  really does need to address the d2h's resolution gap to stay even in the race.
i use the words  "can be" because i have encountered a few older cards that don't  achieve the fast write performance the d2h is capable of.
indeed, even in  shots of birds and other animals with fine feathers or hairs i haven't seen  color fringing or moire.
noise also shows up in underexposed images more readily.
yes, by a long-shot in every aspect of performance.
kelvin settings can be set directly (though at  pre-determined values).
features performance* build value *with a hot mirror filter and proper exposure the definitive d2h book is here click here to find out more.
still, the d2h is a bit controversial.
we all  thought this issue was gone after the kodak dcs 2000 left the market.
at high iso values, though, the mosaic rears its head on the d2h,  though banding seems pretty well under control on my sample.
the center of the pad ought to be where the  right edge currently is.
the voice annotation button is deeply recessed (you have to really want to use it to access it--thus you don't accidentally waste space recording noise due to accidental pressing).
technically, it's nearly a  cmos-type sensor (except with jfet instead of mosfet transistors).
one  potential problem with nikon's decision on the filter: there will be a stronger  tendency to produce color moire patterns on fine, repeating detail; this is not  a camera destined to for serious fashion shoots, imho.
the autofocus direction pad now has a center push ability, which is used  to advantage in a number of different ways (it brings up the histogram when an  image is displayed, for example).
personally, i do prefer edge acuity over resolution, but i also don't produce large fine art prints from my work.
nikon  disclaims all but blower bulb cleaning, and you can't clean without an ac  adapter.
long used to bragging rights on action bursts with their 1d cameras, canon users on the sidelines of professional sports everywhere now know there's a new boy in town, the d2h.
i'll not repeat the  full list of features here, but instead point out some of the things that are  changed or added from the d1 series: the vertical shooting grip gets a front command dial.
while that's still  at least two seconds at 8 fps, it is a limit that you can reach while shooting  intensive action.
this  is a very typical example of what happens when talented engineers don't pay  enough attention to users.
whether this blue channel problem is limited to some camera  bodies or is there for all d2h's made to date is unclear; many of us early  users have encountered this problem, but others claim they haven't seen it.
the center area in one of her  paintings just wouldn't get the color right, and it had a bit of strange noise  in it (the rest of the painting was color accurate, as expected).
it appears that burst write speeds on the d2h can  be as much as 2x the d100 with a wa card (you can't directly compare file write  speeds, as the file sizes are different).rob galbraith has tabulated d2h write  performance on his site, and my results are right in line with his--with the  right card the d2h is state-of-the-art fast.
and the reaction was just as described--twisted heads.
why not just give me a door to insert the battery through?

thus, while the sensor itself may produce  less noise in photosite data than, say, canon's cmos sensor, it still needs to  be run through noise reduction.
so let's delve into the camera and make up our own minds.
the claim that was made is that lbcast chip  itself is inherently less noisy than an equivalent cmos sensor.
nikon has freed themselves from the sony sensor parade with this camera, coming up with a new one of their own.
by that i mean that it is random and more grain-like  than the mosaic, banded, and color-blotched noise you often see in digital  images.
the d2h's sensor is a new design from a new player in sensor design, and has a high bar to get over just to achieve parity with other sensors that are several generations old.
if you learn where all the controls are, there's no reason to take your eye from the finder, exactly the way you want a camera designed for action photography.
it appears that burst write speeds on the d2h can be as much as 2x the d100 with a wa card (you can't directly compare file write speeds, as the file sizes are different).rob galbraith has tabulated d2h write performance on his site, and my results are right in line with his--with the right card the d2h is state-of-the-art fast.
thus, we have our work cut out just running down the feature set and  changes to it.
some other reviewers have remarked about getting more saturation out of their d2h shots, but once i make my usual post-processing adjustments i don't see any significant difference from older nikon dslrs.
despite this somewhat later-than-expected arrival, the d2h only provides a 4 megapixel sensor, which basically matches what the canon 1d had (for some time), and is only half what the canon 1d mark ii came out with.
i'm adjusting that slightly: while the overall amount of near ir that is usable in ir imagry is less, there appears to be an abnormal blue channel response that contributes to noise and color shift, as noted above.
the sound is one that spun a canon 1d shooter's head around faster than linda blair's in the exorcist (doubleclick on the picture below to download the sound to your computer).
the nikon dslr report is the only way to learn more about getting the most from your camera.
for  years, we nikon pros have been slowly losing our eyepieces when they rattled  out from vibration or whatever; no more.
the autofocus system is completely new, quite complex, and versatile.
the  nikon dslr report is the only way to learn more about getting the most from  your camera.
i'm impressed that nikon has taken the time to try to improve, refine, and innovate in as many places as it has.
unlike the d1 series, the rubber doors that sit over these connectors seem to stay closed, and provide a pretty good weather seal.
a 10-minute exposure can pull the battery down 25% or slightly more.
we're talking  about edge definitions, not the size of the edge that can be captured.
that's certainly not true in the horizontal axis, but people are interpreting sharp-appearing d2h images as having more resolution than anti-aliased d1x images, which is wrong.
likewise, reaching to hit the af-on or ae-l buttons with your thumb tends to move your hand position back around the grip, which means you don't have quite as solid a hold on the camera.
wedding photographers are going to  swoon over the flash capabilities.
it appears that curves and placement of ridges was more carefully considered to help handling characteristics.
but there's  a wrinkle in the ointment: things that emit near ir appear to bamboozle the  camera in a couple of ways.
once  you learn how all the controls interact and find the settings that work for the  situations you photograph, you'll find that the new autofocus system is fast,  sure, and reliable.
this means that i have to travel with my extra cost ac adapter.
the new battery is nice in a couple of ways.
nine of the 11 autofocus sensors are low-light, low-contrast capable, which makes it hard to find a situation where the camera won't focus (though it's still possible).
the center area in one of her paintings just wouldn't get the color right, and it had a bit of strange noise in it (the rest of the painting was color accurate, as expected).

one small touch that has gone unnoticed in other reviews: the eyepiece  won't unscrew unless you first close the viewfinder eyepiece shutter.
batteries  charge modestly fast.
some folk were  simply expecting a camera that blew away all previous dslrs in terms of noise  (e.g., a camera that performed at iso 1600 the way others do at iso 100).
nikon  literature refers to it as a jfet lbcast sensor (junction field effect  transistor, lateral buried charge accumulator and sensing transistor array)  because that describes the unique design that underlies each photosite.
requires sb-800 for best flash.
other sensor-related items have changed, as well.
on the flip side, the large number of buttons required for a digital body are all well marked, large, and nicely recessed on the d2h.
most of the translations i saw--and the comments made by nikon officials at the us and european launchs--led everyone to believe that the claim was "the pixels from a d2h will be lower in noise than any existing camera."
less obvious than all the external changes is the sensor, buried deep in  the all-black body.
voice annotation is built in.
i actually mashed my d2h shutter release down recently just to see what the canon shooters near me would do.
thus, while the sensor itself may produce less noise in photosite data than, say, canon's cmos sensor, it still needs to be run through noise reduction.
but you have to learn the nuances to get the most from it, especially since both the group dynamic autofocus and default autofocus positions re-introduce closest subject priority as an option.
if you do scenic work, as i do, you need  dx lenses to restore your wide angle due to the 1.5x angle of view change.
note that flash emits a great deal of near ir and ir light, and i've indeed run into the problem more often indoors using flash than elsewhere.
moreover, a side location is better than the previous front location if  you hold cameras in the traditional manner (left hand under lens, right hand on  grip).
in particular, if you hold the camera  primarily using the front grip, you'll find the thumb reach to the autofocus  direction pad is a little long.
the list of specification changes or additions i'd ask for is relatively  minimal: it would be nice to have iso 100 (to match all the charts published in  nikon flash manuals, including the sb-800).
so the trade-off is better detail at the expense of potential moire.
you have a choice of three color  spaces, and the srgb and adobergb spaces seem accurate in my early testing,  again with some caveats (see end of paragraph and next paragraph).
specifically, that it had the low-power and direct addressing  characteristics of cmos and the low-noise and dark current properties of a ccd.
and they all  interact with a couple of custom settings, which control the release-priority  versus focus-priority choice, and the pattern that's used in group dynamic af.
the center of the pad ought to be where the right edge currently is.
in  nikon's launch pr, the company made significant claims about this new  technology.
the d2h is not a  camera you can shoot at anything other than proper exposure.
and there nikon didn't make any significant claims [e.g., they didn't say "our noise reduction techniques are better than canon's].
the bottom line remains the same, however: nikon has  produced a sensor of their own design, and it's competitive with other  technologies.
color accuracy is good with caveats that  can be dealt with.
the problem, of course, is that canon's offering, the 1d mark ii, has an 8mp sensor, so nikon really does need to address the d2h's resolution gap to stay even in the race.
moreover, a side location is better than the previous front location if you hold cameras in the traditional manner (left hand under lens, right hand on grip).
no longer do you  have to guess whether the half-full battery indicator means you're about to  have a dead battery or you've still got some life left in it.
