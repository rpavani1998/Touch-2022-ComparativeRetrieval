i would appreciate any input on the new magic imaging features: anti-blur, etc... are they any good?...
the new k200d and k20d, just like their predecessors the k100d and k10d both offer features that will cost a lot more to get in any other brand.

not sure about in the rest of the world, but their distribution within australia didn't move with the times, and hence their availability was poorer than other brands.

a ricoh k-mount isn't a pentax lens though.
on nikon, just about every ai lens or later will mount and work, with some limitations in functionality, just like pentax.
fwiw, pentax is _the_ camera of choice for medium format film landscape photographers in japan.
the pentax da* lenses have a double af system.

they split the medium format film market with mamiya, whose cameras are seen more as studio cameras.
as for myself, the last few times i've gone to buy a camera, i was purchasing a compact that both my wife and i would be using.
they work, they won't autofocus.
pentax sdm lenses won't work on earlier cameras, such as the k100d.

if an optical viewfinder is one of your requirements, you will rule out pretty much everyone.
because pentax don't have the serious pro 35mm format digitals, that market has been left to canon and nikon.
the digital slrs are also compatible with older lenses
i think the two things i like best about pentax was that they used really good glass in their lenses, and my big hands always seem to fit the controls even though the body sizes have been quite small.

the first slr with spot metering as i recall in the late 60's.

the ricoh lenses can be modified and then will work fine.

their k-10d is one of the top rated dslrs, and they've just announced a k-20d @ 14mpx - body about $1k. and unlike nikon and canon pentax dslrs are backward compatible with all of pentax's legacy lenses; going all the way back to screw mount (although somewhat grudgingly and with some limitations in functionality - but you can use them).

i think the two things i like best about pentax was that they used really good glass in their lenses, and my big hands always seem to fit the controls even though the body sizes have been quite small.
as a result, these 2 hold the vast majority of the market share.
on cameras that support it they will use sdm and on older cameras they'll revert to the old screwdrive af.

they look pretty similar to me, the extra 1 megapixel is not worth much to me.

although there are some limitations with focus and metering, you can attach, and then take a photograph with all old pentax k mount lenses, or with a suitable adapter you can also use thread, 645 and 67 lenses.

if it is non-pentax, but in k, thread, 645, or 67 mount, then it will most probably still work.

if it is a non-afs lens, which is a lot, even current models, then you will have no af on some models.
pentax *ist ds - pentax k10d - hi, ii have a nice collection of pentax screwmount lenses which i use with old manuel cameras.
compare this scenario with canon and nikon, where not even all the genuine lenses will work.

(my best bet is that most of the mamiya cameras are, like the hasselblad 500 series, not being mfd, but are still being sold as new from stock.

which is the same situation you will have with nikon if you mount a non-afs lens on a d40/d40x.

yes, but if it is a non-ai lens, then on some cameras you have no metering at all (at least pentax gives stop-down metering), and on some models they won't fire at all.

their dslrs are considered by many to offer very good value for money.

canon and nikon are just better at developing and marketing new products.

they are still a fairly strong player in the advanced amateur category at #3 in dslr (albeit a long way behind canon and nikon).
the digital slrs are also compatible with older lenses
will appreciate any comments from anyone who knows what they are talking about.
they just released the k200d and k20d dslrs and have others in the works.
which basically means most 3rd party lenses won't deliver af on these cameras.

as p&ss get smaller, and lcd screens get bigger, there's simply not enough room for a viewfinder on many of the cameras.

interestingly, only one of the pentax and mamiya medium format film cameras has been discontinued.
