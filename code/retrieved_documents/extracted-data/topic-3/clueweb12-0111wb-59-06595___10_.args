when it came to metering, in a variety of conditions, both inside and out, the nikon and the pentax were more reliable, with the canon proving erratic at times.different lenses will give different sharpness and contrast, but they won’t affect the noise or how the firmware treats processing the jpeg from the raw data.at iso400 the nikon and canon are still performing very well, there’s only very minor effects, but the pentax now shows clear tonal variation in the shadows, it’s clearly worse than the other two, but in itself, doesn’t affect the overall picture quality.ultimately i would still want to handle the cameras for myself to see how they felt in my own hands, but at least i would be well informed on the technical aspects of their performance and thus better able to come to an informed decision.like the nikon d90, it also has user configurable high iso noise reduction with the same four settings of off, low, medium and high.this a a software setting for jpegs which will affect images considerably with regards to dynamic range, noise and overall exposure.if you want to pick out the killer shot when something is speeding past your lens, you’re going to need the ability to either continually focus or shoot lots of images very quickly, or in fact, both at once.the pentax is as good as the nikon and canon at iso100, and better at a number of things, but the image quality drops off when the iso goes higher.however, the pentax clearly showed better dynamic range without enhancements, producing detail in the shadows, yet also coming up with generally more detail in darker skies.the canon is very similar to the pentax but in straight zone metering terms the best result is from the nikon which has weighted the scene with more consideration of the other elements, giving a better overall exposure.the nikon has many advantages in terms of continuous af and is easier to live with overall, but you dont need to put the pentax down for faults it doesn't actually have.so combining use of shadow correction and underexposing by misuse of center-weighted metering puts the k-7 at a significant disadvantage that it didn't need against formidable competition.in terms of pure image quality, at iso100, there’s no real difference between the cameras.this led to significant underexposure on many images.at the f/5.6 aperture the canon lens is slightly sharper than the pentax and the nikon which are the same, though the pentax again has more contrast.
