it also incorporates an improved laser-based system for autofocus assist, which worked very well in low light and consistently allowed myd7000 to focus when it otherwise couldn’t quite figure it out.build quality is certainly on par with nikon and canon’s offerings.the flash will also automatically zoom between 24mm and 85mm based on the focal length of the lens attached to your camera.the recycle speed is relatively quick, and with fresh batteries, it consistently from full power in under 4 seconds.while i haven’t felt the original, i will say that these feel great, and are right in line with the quality of nikon’s own speedlights.the speedlight feels incredibly solid in the hand, and is made with very nice feeling plastics.i’m not a big flash user, and i almost always prefer available light for my work, but occasionally you need one to do the job, and the yongnuo yn468-ii far exceeds what it’s price would lead you to believe.the ittl implementation works flawlessly, and my shots came out perfectly exposed every time.for some time, yongnuo flashes weren’t compatible with dslr’s ttl metering systems, which meant you needed to use them in manual mode.the packaging is basic, but very nikon-like in it’s gold and black glory.the phoblographer by andy hendriksen on march 24, 2012 yongnuo, a company out of hong kong, has become well known for making pretty darn good speedlight alternatives to canon or nikon.it comes with the speedlight in a velvet pouch, along with a snap-on diffuser and a tabletop stand.yongnuo is currently selling the yn468-ii on amazon for $109.95, and considering that’s $200 less than you’ll pay for nikon’s cheapest speedlight, thesb–700, i really don’t think you can go wrong.yongnuo yn468-ii speedlight for nikon by andy hendriksen on march 24, 2012 yongnuo, a company out of hong kong, has become well known for making pretty darn good speedlight alternatives to canon or nikon.i wish there was more to say about this thing, but it really is just a great unit for an almost unbelievable price.
