i can’t up the frames per second by choosing a different format.
proven image results.
the equipment must stand up to extreme temperatures, rain, snow, sleet, and heat.
and yes, a good camera will produce better images, even though the key ingredient is always the photographer and the photographer’s skills.
and yes, more megapixels produce better resolution.
yes, a canon xti will produce great images, i have some to prove it, but it won’t last very long with the kind of travel photography that i do.
course, the major consideration for me is that i own lots of canon l glass.
i am pleased with the 1ds mark ii, although the speed of the 1d mark iin and the 1.3 multiplier sure is great for wildlife.
five years ahead, we might very well be totally shocked at what is produced as technology gets better and better.
the scores of the d3x indicate it is the best of the lot.
and choices of lenses will be the bane of the photographer.
no it does not offer different shooting modes.
full frame and partial frame at higher speeds.
and i am very happy with the 1ds mkiii’s resolution, just not happy with canon quality-control.
what is good is that we do have some amazing options today.
the real market for both the d3x and the 1ds mark iii, is not nature photographers, it is the professional photographer who does studio work, weddings, or the sports shooters and newspaper reporters who use the camera on a daily basis.
problem is, the movies i have seen are terrible, with jerky motion.
both the mk iii and the d3x are good top of the line pro cameras.
which is superior is splitting hairs and, if you have one, the question of buying the other should be answered by your accountant.
at 24mp there is nothing out there, other than the sony alpha, that offers this much resolution.
in other words, it’s better than its sibling, but not yet a professional grade camera.
my quandary is wanting one camera that will do both, one that will withstand the rough treatment of travel and usage.
weather sealed and built like a small abrams tank.
any flaw in a lens will show.
at 21.1 megapixels it is a tad shy of the nikon d3x offering, but it has been around for a good while and the images it produces are equal, in my opinon, to the new nikon offering.
but, one thing is for sure, i don’t envision that anytime soon i would have the funds to jump into the medium format arena.
i hate to even think about it, i yearn for a light-weight camera that produces great images.
if he really means it, he should dump all his canon equipment, not even consider nikon, and immediately run out and buy a couple of mamiya rz67 pro iid bodies, a bunch of lenses, 2 leaf backs, and a bunch of car batteries.
the only beneficiary of that merry-go-round are camera dealers and used camera buyers.
all produce images above 21 mp.
nikon d3x is an awesome camera .
five years ago we could not have foreseen what the technology would produce in such a short time.

when one travels and when one enters into the real world of nature photography, the affects of weather on equipment is paramount.
i can buy one for about $2,700, which is substantially less than the d3x and the 1ds iii.
the second is build quality and durability.
it has one great advantage over the nikon d3x, and that is sensor cleaning.
wow, it may offer those of us who do both landscapes and wildlife photography a great resource.

the 5d mark ii offers the photographer a 21.1 megapixel camera with a full-frame sensor and something entirely new, hd movies!
what a revolution that will offer the photographer if it does mature.
the d3x does not offer sensor cleaning.
but, i suspect that there are lots of photographers like myself out in the real world who are going through the same process that i am, that are looking at real choices that are available now.
most consumer grade cameras won’t get close to that number.
with outstanding image quality, it is difficult to pass up, particularly if the price for it drops in the next six months, and likely it will when its replacement is announced.
i want a camera that will withstand what i will put it through.
full frame and partial frame at higher speeds.
it has a scratch on the selection wheel, but other than that it is in perfect condition.
but, it will cost one heck of a lot more than the 1ds mark iii which is available today.
besides the cost will come down substantially in the next six months.
canon says it has improved the weather sealing.
i just stumbled upon your blog and wanted to say that i have really enjoyed browsing your blog posts.
both the mk iii and the d3x are good top of the line pro cameras.

second, just getting to the spot that one is about to shoot in involves airplanes, safari vehicles, trekking across long distances, dust, and sometimes moving by boat in both fresh and salt water.
the 5d mark ii offers the photographer a 21.1 megapixel camera with a full-frame sensor and something entirely new, hd movies!
you would love the image quality but the 3.9 mps may not be enough for wildlife shots.
but, heavy means the camera can take better photos at lower shutter speeds.

as to the 5d mark ii, we are reading some bad experiences with new owners.
course any new camera will have production issues.
very high resolution and reduced resolution for images per second.
replacing my canon lenses with nikon lenses will push the price tag close to $20,000!
at first blush, the nikon d3x sounds like the answer, giving the photographer the option of shooting full-frame or a reduced sized shot at higher speeds.
i can buy one for about $2,700, which is substantially less than the d3x and the 1ds iii.
because canon will respond to the nikon d3x challenge with a mega mega megapixel camera.
at this level, lens diffraction will be a major issue, especially for nature photography where one wants greater depth of field.
but, it will cost one heck of a lot more than the 1ds mark iii which is available today.
like the nikon, it is a professional grade camera.
i want something that works when the light is there before me.
which is superior is splitting hairs and, if you have one, the question of buying the other should be answered by your accountant.
course, i remember buying the 1ds for that four years ago, so perhaps it is not out of line.
i want a camera that will work when i need it to work.
canon has to make a pro replacement for the 1ds mark iii soon because the 5d mk ii has a better processor, same megapixels, etc.
he says that heavy is better.
in other words, it’s better than its sibling, but not yet a professional grade camera.
i want a camera that will work when i need it to work.
and it can do neat stuff, like move into another mode and capture shots at less megapixels but with astonishing speed.
best regards, billreply after sending my canon 20d back to canon 5 times; getting a brand new canon 1ds mkii with a bad sensor; and sending my canon 1ds mkiii back to canon for underexposing 2 full stops, i was ready to sell all my canon lenses and move back to nikon.
course, the major consideration for me is that i own lots of canon l glass.
for those of us who do nature stuff, well, we have to hang our hats on what manufacturers offer to full-time photographers.
i can buy a 1ds mark iii for about $1,500 less than the d3x.
at 21.1 megapixels it is a tad shy of the nikon d3x offering, but it has been around for a good while and the images it produces are equal, in my opinon, to the new nikon offering.

second, just getting to the spot that one is about to shoot in involves airplanes, safari vehicles, trekking across long distances, dust, and sometimes moving by boat in both fresh and salt water.
so, maybe nikon isn’t too far off in the price.
that capability would simply change everything we do with a camera and offer up a new world of light.
all full frame cameras with no multipliers.
but, one thing is for sure, i don’t envision that anytime soon i would have the funds to jump into the medium format arena.
the only beneficiary of that merry-go-round are camera dealers and used camera buyers.
after all, i have spent probably as much as the camera is worth just getting to where i am about to shoot.
i just stumbled upon your blog and wanted to say that i have really enjoyed browsing your blog posts.

but, canon does not rate it as a professional grade camera.
if i did, a hassy would already be in my camera bag.
nikon d3x is a clear winner .
only the best glass can be used with these cameras.
yes, a canon xti will produce great images, i have some to prove it, but it won’t last very long with the kind of travel photography that i do.
best regards, billreply bill, i think the camera you want hasn’t been sold yet.
so, a weather sealed camera with top notch construction is a major consideration.
the 1ds mark iii originally hit the market at around that amount as well.
he says that heavy is better.
when one travels and when one enters into the real world of nature photography, the affects of weather on equipment is paramount.
nikon’s announcement of this camera is receiving lots of interest by serious photographers.
bill makes a telling statement but doesn’t follow through on it.
as these high-end cameras become more complex, and quality-control becomes more and more of an issue, professionals will need to demand more from nikon and canon, and stop tolerating poor workmanship and performance.
nikon’s announcement of this camera is receiving lots of interest by serious photographers.
it just isn’t built well enough.
the first is weather sealing.
but, in terms of image quality, in my opinion, it is as good as the nikon.
well, first, it tops the megapixel race.
after all, i have spent probably as much as the camera is worth just getting to where i am about to shoot.
heavy is something i detest, but heavy means solid and heavy means better photographs.
and it can do neat stuff, like move into another mode and capture shots at less megapixels but with astonishing speed.
it has a scratch on the selection wheel, but other than that it is in perfect condition.
i hate having to spend hours and hours getting rid of dust spots on my images.
one can only tell when we compare the detailed shots taken by nikon d3x and canon 5dm2.
problem is, the movies i have seen are terrible, with jerky motion.
if i was you i would wait a bit and keep your ear to the ground.
but, in terms of image quality, in my opinion, it is as good as the nikon.
it produces fantastic images.

why?  well, first, it tops the megapixel race.
by the way, i purchased the 5d mk ii and it is a great camera.
wow, it may offer those of us who do both landscapes and wildlife photography a great resource.
very high resolution and reduced resolution for images per second.
one example is “black silicon” which is 100-500 times more sensitive to light that current silicon used in sensors.
heck, one trip will buy any of these cameras, and i do about four major trips per year.
