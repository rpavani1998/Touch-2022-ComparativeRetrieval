by not doing so they lost thousands of loyal users to the 5d mark ii.
it’s actually an attempt to take three measurements and roll them  into a nice little package.
in reality, a “one” number fits all model is something many attempt to do but is rarely a useful.
i see plenty of buzz on forums lately about the new “king” of digital photography, the nikon d800.
dxo dynamic range comparison.
the question is do those number provide any useful real world information  … or is it really just something for engineering types.
consider a wedding  dress.
it should be fun to try and equate  the resolution of these cameras and other factors in delivering large prints  … finding out at what point one shows itself as better than another one  … if at all!
when it comes to the low light iso test, the  nikon wins handily.
sure i can shoot those types of things, but it’s not the best tool.
when you use cameras with this high of  resolution,  you have very small sensels, and everything you do when  creating an image affects the final “real” resolution and dynamic  range you can achieve from any camera.
i don’t care about  how many frames per second (which is about 1) it shoots, how fast it focuses  (which isn’t fast) or high iso.
i’m a landscape shooter  … no animals, no people.

dxo measurements are an attempt to reach a non biased objective comparison of camerasensors.
to get some perspective on what the dxo number means, we need to try and understand what dxo is attempting to quantify.
that’s difficult because it’s created by engineers and is really an engineering standard.
for example the g11 achieves  a higher score than the g10, even though it has only 2/3rds the resolution.
and don’t accuse me in trying to  tear down the d800, because i have nothing but praise for it …
at what point does too much light reach the sensor so the sensels recording the dress saturate, meaning the camera can no longer record the difference between the subtle variations in white which provide the detail in the dress.
the real question that i would like to see answered is how much difference the higher resolution of the nikon makes in real world shooting.
nikon should have put the d3x sensor  in a slightly modified d700 a long time ago … i have no clue why they  didn’t.
but what if you don’t care about one of those three?
all this chart really proves is the d800  performs better at higher iso's.
define better so to begin, if the d800 is better, the first thing we need to do is define better.
the real test will be in  prints.
one other challenge of the dxo marks is how they arrive at the “overall” score, 95 for the d800 and 91 for the iq180.
it can’t even  tell you which camera is better than another camera.
it’s not a useless number, but it is incorrect to extrapolate one camera is better than another one because of the numbers.
before going any further, don’t please don’t accuse me of being  a phaseone fanboy because i’ve invested a large amount in an iq180  system.
while i don’t think iso 102,400 will be of much use, it looks  really good at 12,800.
when it comes to the low light iso test, the nikon wins handily.
best can only be defined by  each individuals parameters.
the d3x is/was a terrific camera but the price was way out of reach for most.
my subjects rarely move so i can expose monument valley for 1/10th of a second at iso 35 on my rock steady tripod rather than cranking up the iso.
if you do, you haven’t been following my blog, otherwise  you would know i don’t do that.
with dxo that line is when noise=signal, a s/n
you can follow any responses to this entry through therss 2.0 feed.← name (required) mail (will not be published) (required)
in real world usage you won’t see the 14.3 stops of the d800 because a s/n ratio of 1:1 won’t make anyone happy.
they’re probably hasn’t been a dslr made in 5 years that doesn’t beat the iq180 when used at it’s optimal resolution.
but i’ll also admit that few need what i’m after, which is  sheer resolution so i can make very large prints (we’re talking  70-90″) from a single file if i want to.
here i go again with asubjective point of view … in fact comparing these two cameras is like  trying to compare apples to oranges.
the three are listed as “landscape” which is  based on overall maximum dynamic range, “portrait” which is based  on color depth, and “sports”, which is based on low light iso  performance.
this is the ceiling of the sensors dynamic range.
i see plenty of buzz on forums lately about the new “king” of  digital photography, the nikon d800.
i have a sony nex system that i use for that other stuff.
of course, in the real world no one buys a medium  format system if they need low light shooting capabilities.
compare this to a measuring cup.
i’ll let you know when i finish, and  you  can stop by and pixels and see the prints for yourself.
maybe portraits, or weddings, or sports photography.
higher iso  isn’t something they’re engineered to do.
what dxo has proven is sony knows how to make sensors and the new sensor in  the d800 is the most modern and perhaps best sensor technology around.
it is  filed underarticles & reviews, blog, capture.
who cares if  there’s  a little noise in the shot if it captures that special  moment?
it can’t even tell you which camera is better than another camera.
from the dxo graphs  you can see how the dynamic range decreases as the iso increases, because this  process adds noise and thus raises that floor faster than the signal  amplification can raise the ceiling.
i suppose they were  afraid of cannibalizing the d3x … but hard to cannibalize sales of  something that hardly anyone bought.
i think  it’s a fantastic camera.
i suppose they were afraid of cannibalizing the d3x … but hard to cannibalize sales of something that hardly anyone bought.
a couple of key factors which affect this, sensel saturation and noise.
the d800 wins the dynamic range test by a little, but then both are  outstanding.
sensor resolution, lens sharpness and contrast, tripod stability, diffraction from the aperture, lens shade to cut down flare (all the time, not just when you think a light is hitting the lens.), a uv filter in front of the lens, aa filter (d800) or not (d800e), iso, post post processing … all this and more affects actual real world results and defines how good your files will look when printed.
thankfully for nikon shooters  that’s in the past and this new camera appears to be fantastic and very  reasonably priced.
they’re  probably hasn’t been a dslr made in 5 years that doesn’t beat the  iq180 when used at it’s optimal resolution.
best can only be defined by each individuals parameters.
so as you raise that floor, from 1:1 to 2:1, then perhaps 4:1 and finally 8:1, you end up with a more realistic dynamic range of 3 stops less … 11.3.
one other challenge of the dxo marks is how they arrive at the  “overall” score, 95 for the d800 and 91 for the iq180.
dxo measurements are an attempt to reach a non  biased objective comparison of camerasensors.
we  don’t know where the 5d mark iii sensor will fall, but it’s also a  new generation and it will be close, and better at higher iso’s.
when this happens to a sensel in a camera the result is a blown pixel in a file.
terms why making this extrapolation is misleading.
at what point does too much light reach the sensor so the sensels  recording the dress saturate, meaning the camera can no longer record the  difference between the subtle variations in white which provide the detail in  the dress.
so where is the floor?
i think it’s important to put dxo into perspective, because it can’t tell you what camera is best for you.
not much point in comparing 100% screen crops since no one looks at images that way.
so factoring that into  the final “score” is misleading.
so comparing a d700 to a d800, (which have cmos sensors) might be somewhat useful, but comparing a d800 to a sigma (foveon sensor) or a medium format back such as the phaseone iq180 (which a ccd sensor) is less useful.
i think it’s a fantastic camera.
sure you may shoot the same kind of things, but chances are you shoot other stuff too.
this is where it gets a little challenging – because this is a subjective decision.
the basic premise of the test is to provide an indicator of how well a  sensor can differentiate between light levels as well as differentiate between  color levels.
so what’s dxo trying to say?
compare  this to a measuring cup.
the other factor is noise, and what dxo measures is the ratio of signal  (light) to the noise.
this is especially true when you aren’t comparing similar sensors and similar bodies.
what you find is once you start to make sense of it, you realize dxo  numbers like this aren’t very useful in any real world comparison.
same thing applies to the iq180 … except at lowest iso levels a ccd sensor seems to do a little better, so real world performance there’s a good chance the two will be virtually identical.
but if i wanted to be the “king” of dxo, i could design a  camera with about 8 megapixels on a full frame sensor using all the same  technology sony has used to create the sensor in the d800.
so really there is no “best”.
and in fact what may be  unacceptable in one type of photography, perhaps a landscape, may not be a  problem at all with other types of photography, say sports.
sorry, the 8mp sensor would win, because using similar technology, larger pixels will result in cleaner results and a higher number in dxo. but who wants to shoot with an 8mp camera?
probably not even close.
i know what my definition is and what i’m trying to get out of my equipment, and despite those tremendous 36mp of the nikon, without even testing it i can tell you to me it’s not better.
so this “acceptable” level of noise at the bottom becomes the “floor” of the dynamic range.
the question is do those number provide any useful real world information … or is it really just something for engineering types.
but what about a 24×30.
you can follow any responses  to this entry through therss 2.0 feed.
this is perhaps the  only realistic measurement they could use because any other line is subjective,

considering the same sensor in a sony camera went for about  $3k, nikon could have easily hit the price point.
unfortunately those which do so show how little they understand what dxo measures.

so of course i took it upon myself to attempt to explain in layman’s
old articles dxo tests show nikon d800 is better than a phaseone iq180!
who wants to see just an eyeball?
so to begin, if the d800 is better, the first thing we need to do is define better.
we all know that sheer number of pixels isn’t the only important  thing, because the quality of those pixels can be dramatically different.
the bottom end of a sensor range is when this signal to noise ratio gets to the point the noise overwhelms the signal and you can no longer distinguish different levels of light.
what may be acceptable noise in dark shadow detail to one person may be unacceptable to another.
basically we’re talking about dynamic range.
considering the same sensor in a sony camera went for about $3k, nikon could have easily hit the price point.
i think it’s important to put dxo into perspective, because it  can’t tell you what camera is best for you.
the iq180 wins the color depth test by a small amount, but again both are outstanding.
i’m going to be shooting the d700, d800, 5d mark 2 and mark 3 as  well as the phase one iq180 in the near future.
but then even if the canon happens to better the  nikon with the dxo tests, everything i’ve written applies – the  number really doesn’t mean much.
this is true of any of the cameras they measure … real world results for all of these cameras will be a few stops less than the dxo rating.

the precision of the photographers technique (the craft part of photography) will have far more bearing on the final image quality than a small amount of increased dynamic range.
technique is the real king … the precision of the photographers technique (the craft part of  photography) will have far more bearing on the final image quality than a small  amount of increased dynamic range.
but what if you don’t care about one of  those three?
the iq180 is great for landscape shooters, high end commercial shooters, fashion shooters, architectural shooters who want to use it on a view camera.
but i’ll also admit that few need what i’m after, which is sheer resolution so i can make very large prints (we’re talking 70-90″) from a single file if i want to.

everything in the capture chain counts, not just the sensor sensitivity.
the three are listed as “landscape” which is based on overall maximum dynamic range, “portrait” which is based on color depth, and “sports”, which is based on low light iso performance.
some claim, based on the dxo overall  rating of 95, it means the d800 is better than the phaseone iq180 (an 80mp  medium format sensor), which “only” scores a 91.
before going any further, don’t please don’t accuse me of being a phaseone fanboy because i’ve invested a large amount in an iq180 system.
i can’t wait to get out on a shoot with one.
