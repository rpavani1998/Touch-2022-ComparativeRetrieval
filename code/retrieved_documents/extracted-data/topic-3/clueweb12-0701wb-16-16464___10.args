lacks of dial control that canon has as standard.
chris tomkin i have been using canon powershots for years but the wife treated me to this camera and its just about full auto on every thing.
in use the nikon coolpix l110 feels good in the hand and the zoom control is smooth.
on hd footage the zoom is very slow and even at the slow speed it still has problems on the focus side of things i really wish i had kept my canon s2 is bought it, played with it,... sure, few manual controls, but do leave the dslr back in the car and get great results for point and shoot with this nikon.
i hate a yellowish tone on tungsten and that too bright display but just have to set it lower and it's done.
easy to use and navigate, the camera mode menu caters for most situations and image quality is fine, although a tripod is best employed in some situations.
sports mode have a lot of noise not compared to cheaper canon's.
for more control there's the auto mode which allows user-defined white balance and iso settings.
i just got this camera, and i could do with going to see my doctor.
, i have been using canon film slr cameras and my first digital camera is still fuji 2mp 203, many of my friends have canon digital cameras and no doubt very good quality, i need aa batteries "a must have" , a nice view finder, 8 to 14 mp and manual mode option with a price range up to 200$ camera, i know canon's g11 is a great camera
nikons website is user unfriendly and their customer service is the same it seems.
the zoom is a joke, most large zooms offer some sort if speed control for finer zooming.
in use the nikon coolpix l110 feels good in the hand and the zoom control is smooth.
one slight whinge is that the sd card is inserted in the same compartment as the batteries, yet the batteries aren't secured like many li-ion batteries would be.
in conclusion, i'd reckon it value for money.
after living with the l110 for just under a year, i am pleased with the purchase, which in the main, does a good job.

of course, i don't think that the quality of the image is really good, but it's ok how it is.
however, some of the buttons can lack responsiveness and needed a slightly firmer or secondary push before producing the desired result on some occasions.
i hope i made the right choice.. got this camera a couple of months ago had some trouble a first but after a couple of sessions with the manual all is well also i think that the battery life is pretty good
the l110 screen does have an anti-reflective coating that helps but isn't foolproof.
we cannot make this camera work as we think it should and are more than disappointed with it!
the primary purpose of the l110 is, of course, being a superzoom and utilising that 15x optical zoom which extends smoothly and with a regular pace.
but it doesn't make better than my older canon or higher iso should help more.
i really like this camera for the range that it falls into.
nikon l110 review - click for full size image low-light situations add the benefit of an af-assist lamp which includes the option to turn it off should this be undesireable.
go with "indoor party" on the scene mode to take quality pics indoors.
the l110 has a macro mode that works up to 1cm from the camera's lens, though only at the wide end will it focus correctly as expected.
the camera at first was not getting good shots - but a quick read of the manual and all was well.
coolpix l110 is not professinal camera.shows poor perfomance in low light thogh it has an iso ranging from 80-6400.no manual mode,shutter speed and aperture cannot be set manually.
i came from canon to nikon but due to a limited budget, as article stands is a good deal for the money.
the 3in lcd screen to the rear is of good quality, though is overly-bright when compared to viewing images on a computer screen - so much so that the former makes some image areas appear overexposed when they're not.
and yet, it does offer 28-420mm equiv for £200 and you'd be hard pressed to find that anywhere else.
it is a bad camera and even my 10 year olds son's fuji z10fd takes better pictures...
if the camera's upside down this isn't an issue, but the batteries can slide around or fall out when open, so the sd would have been better placed in its own area.
it's a horrible camera, bad pictures in just about ever indoor setting with or without flash, the hd footage is a joke, the large screen fools you, did some footage under normal lights looked fantastic on the small screen on the camera, but once home it was on my pc
awesome camera - those that complain should really read the f* manual first

easy auto mode works as expected and is essentially an advanced automated option that auto-selects the best available settings for the scene at hand.
i use 3200 but is noisy.
the jpegs have more highlight detail than is apparent on the lcd screen, which can make for some difficulty in providing accurate exposure.
at first, i thought that it wasn't a good choice, but after i played a little with the settings and read the manual, it started to be nice.
i thought the picture quality indoors was pretty poor but excellent outdoor.

at the longest end the 420mm holds fairly steadily and, while optical stabilisation would have been an advantage here to further steady ‘live' during framing, the sensor-shift stabilisation helps provide further assurance of a sharper image capture.
for more control there's the auto mode which allows user-defined white balance and iso settings.
earlier canon powershot a550 is way better in all aspects.
also there is no viewfinder as per some competitors' superzoom compacts, so no other way to conceive taking an image when in bright sunlight.
but you get what you pay for and i find the zoom and quality fine - pictures are good and for the price you are not going to get better!
i would have liked to see the lens barrel screwed to enable a hood and to enable the lens cap fitted in, (so protecting the lens whilst in standby).
this camera does a great job.
this one on or off there is no slow zoom just fast.
useless in low light and can't shoot a moving subject.
http://asia.cnet.com/reviews/digitalcameras/0,39005881,45197464p,00.htm i bought htis camera, but its poor performance in low light, absence of view finder, misleading monitor which gives false rendition of photos taken,absolutely poor picture quality,video mode that is no good in low light...the list is endless.

i noticed it was very very grainy.

your comments will be recorded, but you might not be benefiting all the features.
one slight whinge is that the sd card is inserted in the same compartment as the batteries, yet the batteries aren't secured like many li-ion batteries would be.
not a pro piece of kit but its terrific for the money and all that most amatuer punters will ever want.
love 4 aa bats, chaeper, easier to charge and last a very good time.
i was going to sell the camera but after reading the comments above i think i should read the manual and stop being a bloke.
power comes in the form of 4xaa batteries - some may love it, others may hate it; in fact it may be the reason to buy or not to buy.
i'm not a pro, but i think it's a really good camera.
i did a wedding using "portrait " setting and it was a big mistake then experimented with different scenes and "indoor party" were clear and crisp.
video still jerky and sound is awful for any type of live music.
particular praise for the movie mode with the exception of a certain fuzziness at full zoom, other than that, sound and picture quality are fine.

if the image quality was improved then this would be recommended.
some dumb when you need fast shooting, sometimes you get some lag that make you miss nice shots.
also there is no viewfinder as per some competitors' superzoom compacts, so no other way to conceive taking an image when in bright sunlight.
at the end i need to save some money to get a better canon cause this one is a good one but not the one i need.
trust the auto agree that the image quality is the biggest let down of this camera.
it's macro is a bit disappointing but zoom is great even on digital range.
the jpegs have more highlight detail than is apparent on the lcd screen, which can make for some difficulty in providing accurate exposure.
the l110 also has ‘color options' to change shooting styles from standard to vivid, b&w, sepia or cyanotype too.
almost bought this camera,thought of big,photos are very poor quality when zoomed.
