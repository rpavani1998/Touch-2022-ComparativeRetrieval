shooting with the articulating screen makes you want to shoot from strange angles and gives you a real sense of freedom.the special features and some of the more common features make this an ideal camera for someone who is stepping up from a p&s or advanced p&s camera.it’s fast, easy to use and it produces excellent photos and video.thea55 on the other hand offers excellent auto settings that help guide the user to achieve the type of shot they desire.i could even see some of my technically challenged family and friends learning and growing with this camera.i could even see some of my technically challenged family and friends learning and growing with this camera.but more importantly, thea55 gives users the means to grow as a photographer.taking the fear out of photography is key for people that are starting out or trying to get better and i think thea55 excels in this area.on top of that,sony has included helpful shooting info and overlays which can be selected by the user when needed.the auto modes work well but on top of the plain auto modessony has added other features which help the user get the most out of the camera.thankfully,sony actually made these features easy to use but more importantly, they are truly helpful.you have way more lenses to choose from, iq is much better, you get more features, in-body image stabilization, built in flash, and the list goes on and on.while it’s not as small as amicro four thirds camera or even the sony nex, it is one of the smaller dslrs on the market.what i mean by progressive features is thea55 offers users that may be new to dslrs or advanced cameras the ability to just pick up the camera and make beautiful photos.thankfully the evf can display the same shooting information that is available on the external screen.
