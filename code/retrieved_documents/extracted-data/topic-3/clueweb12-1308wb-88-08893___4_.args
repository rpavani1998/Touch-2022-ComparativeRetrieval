the d50's advantage is that it doesn't require a motorized lens to focus.the d40 is also lighter and smaller than the d50 and 350d.the d40 has a flash sync of 1/500th of a second which some people don't use and is usually only available on higher-end camerastrue, it has less options but for it's current going price, it's great value for money and there are alot of prowd owners shooting amazing photos with this camera.slr digital camera ’‚’‚…‚’‚‚‚¦‚“ has an average expert rating of 85 (based on 26 expert sources) www.smartratings.com/review/photography/digital_cameras/163 probably canon eos 350d digital rebel xt digital slr is better if it fits your budget.canon 350d= 8mp nikon d50,d40=6mp the d40's disadvantage only auto focuses with motorized lenses.the kit lens is moterized and it does a great job too.if megapixels isn't an issue for you and you're working with a tight budget, the d40 should do you fine.i'm aiming at the 500-600$ price range(lens included), been reading different reviews for a week and still can't decide which one to choose: nikon d40, nikon d50 or the canon 350d.the feel of the d40 is much better and it doesn't feel like a toy like the 350d.it has an internal auto focus motor.in d40 you need a lens with autofocus motor.between d50 and 350d, well 350d advantage is 8 megapixels while the advantage of d50 is a good ergonomics.both lenses that come with it auto focus with it too.nikon d50/ canon 350d hi, i believe i've come to the right place for an advice.the 350d is good if you need to crop because you have more room to crop pictures.
