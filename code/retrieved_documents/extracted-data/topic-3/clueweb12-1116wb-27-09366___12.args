what's good for nikon will be good for us all.
none of these comments have included hard proof of this (spec sheets, links to canon or other data, etc.), but that doesn't stop the opinions from declaring that i'm wrong, and nikon's d3 and d300 screens with 920,000 dots are actually twice as sharp as previous 230,000 pixel lcds (including nikon's d2xs screen).
thanks again, i think you are the only to pick up on this!
a printer may use 6 or more dots (from individual color cartridges) to form the image of a single full-color pixel captured by a camera or scanner.
frankly, i wish nikon would stick to the pixel method of describing lcd monitor resolution, or that all manufacturers would agree to use dots but then describe the actual horizontal and vertical pixel dimensions of the screen (as nikon did by giving the vga tag).
in contrast, the d3's stripe array maps to standard vga resolution (640x480).
new lcd for d3/d300 has 640x480x3 (rgb stripe array filter) = 921,600 dots.
a printer may use 6 or more dots (from individual color cartridges) to form the image of a single full-color pixel captured by a camera or scanner.
search for us in the internet – use next words .
fortunately, nikon added that vga tag in all of its literature to clarify the meaning of the specification.
whichever way you look at it the d3 area resolution is 4 times as much as the old 230k qvga lcds.
also pictures: with occurrence of a specialized portal , became more accessible.
oh well in 18 months everyone will have this (or at least this quality of a display), so the wait will be short.
wah chan | september 05, 2007 at 05:11 am i'm glad you shed light on a feature that nikon is obviously intentionally trying to confuse the camera buying public with.

unfortunately, many reviewers missed that and erroneously thought that the lcd had a super-high 920,000-pixel resolution—which would make it twice as sharp as the 230,000-pixel monitors on the new canons (remember, it takes 4x as many pixels in a two dimensional array to equal twice the resolution).
(not 320x240x3) stripe filter array lcd is more expensive but suits display geometrical data better (character, cg, line).

it is only a matter of time before popphoto also publishes the startling difference and those now saying "shame on you" to nikon will be slinking away with tails between their legs.
almost all dsc use delta array lcd because of lower cost.

see it this way: you cannot map the screen dimensions to 960x240 real pixels.
for example, a 17-inch laptop monitor might have a maximum resolution of 1280x1024-pixels (a very common resolution also called sxga–super extended graphics array).
307'200 nikon has 4x pixelamount done.
usually, maximum computer monitor resolution is listed in horizontal and vertical pixels.
almost every preview of the d300 and d3 inteprets the dots as pixels when comparing them to canon's 40d. i was actualy considering selling all of my gear and switching to nikon, but not any more.
b) cipa guideline: number of pixels/dots: this means the number of effective pixels or dots of (picture/lcd) monitor, where the number means the effective pixels or dots of the area excluding all sections that do not contribute to the display of images or characters.

this is true for all nikon and canon cameras using the delta array lcd's.
(however, to describe the unique foveon sensor in its cameras, sigma uses the total number of sub-pixels found in the three overlapping rgb layers to total the sd14’s megapixel count—a controversial practice).
this helps to explain why a digital file with 200 ppi res can be printed at 600-5400 dpi depending on the printer and its output settings.)

incidentally, the relationship between the number of pixels and the number of dots is that: three dots of consecutive r, g, and b dots constitute one pixel in a display by three primary colors, r, g, and b.
perhaps because 920,000 dots sounds more impressive than saying 307,000 pixels, or perhaps because its engineers thought that was a more accurate way of writing out the spec?
to get the 920,000 dot figure, nikon multiplied the individual rgb dots (often called sub-pixels) used in the stripe array to form a full color pixel.
on the other hand, most camera and camcorder lcd monitors are compared using the product of the horizontal and vertical pixels.
wah chan | september 05, 2007 at 04:50 am nice try, but i believe you have still got it wrong.

it does not mean that what you get is high definition just a brighter and maybe cleaner example of a typical 320x240 vga display.
there is definately more rgb pods onthe d3 and d300 but not in terms of area resolution which is similar to the 230k display of the canon.
your age and experience not a hindrance because everybody can learn.

posted by: david | january 09, 2008 at 07:10 am intresting....we in fact now provide to our surveyors with the nikon d300 and would most probably do so at any time over canon....the sharpness is very much visible.
the math is easy: 640 x 480 x 3= @920,000 dots.
the advantage of stripe over triad rgb is that it let out more backlight allowing the display to look brighter.
pay attention to pictures on this theme: we suggest familiarizing with answer of the questions concerning .
for example, a camera with a 3-inch, 230,000 pixel resolution monitor (such the new canon eos 40d or eos 1 ds mark iii) gets that 230k figure by multiplying its vertical by horizontal pixel counts in the same way cameras often list their effective megapixel resolution by multiplying the sensor’s horizontal and vertical pixel counts.
to get the 920,000 dot figure, nikon multiplied the individual rgb dots (often called sub-pixels) used in the stripe array to form a full color pixel.
it becomes more clearly on the pictures: it is time to study and achieve successes independently.
