however, all will mount (with the noted exceptions), so as long as you're prepared to do a bit of manual work, you'll be able to use any lens in that list (with a d200 onwards, you'll always be able to meter, focus might be manual if the lens is a manual focus one).
being fair, all of canon's listed lenses are af, where as the giants such as the nikon 1200-1700 is not (though try find an af motor to move that optical assembly!).
another interesting fact is that nikon made dx lenses - a smaller image circle for their asp-c cameras.
thus, with some exceptions, you can mount any f-mount lens on your current dslr bodies (the exceptions being invasive fish-eyes; it's just wise not to touch these).
in conclusion we can see that the lens argument isn't as clear cut as people make it out to be.

nikon.) then have a look at the lists provided and select based upon that; don't listen to fanbois propping up their brand because they happen to have a camera and a few lenses.
if you want ultra wide lenses, nikon does appear to have the edge (there's 5 prime lenses between 20 and 13mm for nikon and 1 fish eye, and two fisheye lenses that are below 10mm).

so if you have no slr glass and are looking at canon vs nikon, think about what you'll be shooting.
canon, meanwhile, have the ef lens mount designed in 1987.
canon's ef/ef-s specification list, meanwhile, lists 61 lenses of which 4 of them are ef-s and thus will not mount or work with canon's full frame cameras.
thus you can't mount an fd lens on an ef camera without using adaptors, and since canon re-designed the flange to focal plane length as well, the adaptors will need optical elements.

thus it's not overly economical to mount an fd lens on an ef camera.
for example, trying to find a matching nikon lens for the canon 28-90mm lens is impossible; nikon do have 28-85mm
i will say this, though, for every lens canon has in their ef list, there is a nikon that is comparable, with a few minor exceptions (nikon do not have an 85mm f1.2 for example).
quite simply this means that nikon have a larger selection of lenses in the general case.
the big problem is for every lens canon has that you can find a matching nikon for (in both aperture and focal length), there'll be some canon lenses that are of slightly different focal lengths.
- nikon have a selection of zoom lenses that go past 400mm (200-600mm, 360-1200mm, 1200-1700mm), the longest canon zoom is 100-400mm - nikon have medical, defocus control, reflex, uv and noct lenses, canon does not.
if you want more long-range zooms, nikon wins here.
with their latest full-frame range (d700, d3, d3x), it's possible to mount the dx lenses in crop mode, meaning that your dx glass will still work (d3/d700 will drop to 5.1mp with dx lenses, d3x will drop to 10mp).

trying to do a more direct comparison, though, didn't quite go as planned.
canon also do have some more consumer friendly zoom lenses (70-200mm f4 is comes to mind), but if you look for them, nikon have many f4 lenses for their zoom focal lengths (and even f3.5 and f3.3 and other obscure fixed-aperture zooms)
they are still f-mount lenses and thus will always mount.
canon also made a few ef-s lenses, but these were physically different enough from ef lenses to mean that you can't mount them on canon's full-frame range, not even in a cropped mode.

the major rule is the d40/d40x/d60 will not af with older lenses, and anything less than a d200 will not meter with really old lenses (ai/pre-ai) either.
