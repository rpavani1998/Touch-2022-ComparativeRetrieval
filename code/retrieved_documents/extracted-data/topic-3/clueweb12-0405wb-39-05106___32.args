virtually the same level of control can be achieved with the canon by limiting the iso range in the custom functions, but it is a poor workaround that is not nearly as intuitive as the nikon solution.
remains good at iso6400, even though there is more luminance noise present.
the weather sealed memory card door is opened by rotating a small latch on the rear.
i know fo a few people who work in this way at events.
the flaps cannot be moved out of the way and tend to spring back over the connections, which can be a little awkward.
i have a nikon d3 with a good selection/range of nikon lens' and am very pleased with the equipment.
if you need to shoot at f/1.2 then £1100 is what you need to pay, however, if such shallow dof isn't required, say if you generally shoot between f/2.8 and f/5.6 all the time, you'll barely notice a difference as far as sharpness is concerned.
this lens may give wonderful bokeh and lovely shallow dof effects but it's absolutely crap at fast focussing and imho is without doubt the worst lens you could have chosen to test nikon's autofocus apart from a manual af lens.
i suppose the reviewer could be a panasonic owner / or have a fetish for panasonic but you'll have to believe us that's not true either.

currently canon's widest zoom lens is the ef 16-35mm f/2.8l usm, which with the 1.3 crop factor, will provide an angle of view equivalent to a 21mm lens.

also due to the exceptionally low noise levels, more details can be retrieved from shadow areas also.

the lcd screens on both cameras are bright and clear, making reviewing images and navigating menus a pleasure.
a dioptre adjustment control is located under the rubber eye cup.
for one, sheffield isn't known for its birds of prey.
unfortunately in the matrix meter seem less able to cope with harsh back lighting than canon's metering system, which can result in your subject becoming silhouetted if appropriate compensation isn't applied.
the downside of this is that it may be difficult to source lenses at the wider end for the canon.
still edges are well enough defined and chroma noise levels are low enough to get away with small reproduction sizes on the web.
you'd probably have a fit if you saw the battered old lenses i work with, but the results i get will probably be quite difficult to differentiate from those taken with the latest whizz-bang lenses from nikon or canon, or anyone else.
it is a really useful feature, especially when shooting in rapidly changing lighting conditions.
the camera feel s very comfortable to hold in either portrait or landscape orientations, thanks in part to the soft rubber that covers much of the body.
image quality both cameras produce images of excellent quality in decent conditions, with images straight from the canon having a more vivid appearance when the standard picture style is used.
by default, the spot metering area follows the af point selected, which is especially useful in high contrast situations.
quote: at the end of the day, it was a test of focus, so a moving subject was needed.
i think this is comparing apples to lemons.
pushing the camera beyond its native sensitivity range results in visible softening and loss of colour saturation due to the noise reduction making every attempt to control chroma noise levels.
the advantages of the crop are with longer telephoto lenses, where the narrower angle of view recorded allows for tighter crops with shorter lenses.
it ain't the box, as someone above said, it is the user who makes the difference.
the images below were taken using the raw+jpeg setting and the raw files were processed in capture one 6 using default settings.
saturated primary colours are rendered well and good detail is retained in the highlights.
although the d3s performed well, it didn't manage to get every shot in as sharp focus as the canon.

connections for hdmi, usb, microphone, remote release and a pc socket are all located on the side of the camera.
the viewfinder is bright, clear and quite large, making it easy to confirm focus, even in low light.
i really like the way the eos 1d mkiv handles, especially the viewfinder information and autofocus, which are both superb.
it's a nice feature to have, but i find it a little strange that the photographer would have to carry two separate card formats to make the most of this feature.

don't get me wrong - i think that the review was very thorough and well written but i do think that most folk spending this sort of cash are more likely to be interested in a subject matter which offers a little more challenge than a bus - note i did not say more interest than a bus, so as to avoid offence to those that find that particular subject of higher regard.
features these flagship cameras are designed for superior speed, image quality in low light and are built to take the rough and tumble of daily use, as required by press photo photographers, who may be required to work in difficult conditions, day in, day out.
i used a bus, because they're more regular than peregrines, believe it or not also the peregrine would've had to be very close, as each camera was fitted with a 50mm lens.
canon also have their auto lighting optimiser, which does a very similar job to the nikon's d-lighting feature.
the large lp-e4 battery has a capacity of 2300mah and comes as a one-piece unit with the weather sealed cover permanently attached, making swift battery changes a doddle.
nikon don't do a wider aperture 50mm.
if shooting at really high iso settings is important to you, the nikon d3s is a clear winner here.
to me this makes much more sense than the dual format system on the 1d mkiv, as it means only one memory card format needs to be carried.

although not a major issue, i can see times where a battery may need to be changed in a hurry, or in the dark, that may make this a problem.
the canon eos 1d mkiv makes a compelling argument for itself, and offers exceptional performance.
here a slight amount of luminance noise can be seen if images are inspected closely at 100%, but contrast and detail levels are still good.
strangely the same mild magenta cast is present in images taken with the canon under incandescent light using the incandescent preset too.
the slots can each be configured to receive raw files or jpegs independently or simultaneously as a backup, or one card can be designated for videos, whilst the other records images.
so, i would count cf and sd slots as a "pro", not a "con", and the lack of an sd slot is the primary reason i'm using a d7000 right now instead of the d3s.
the purchase of an sd card is much less expensive then the manufacturer's attachment to do the same.
under incandescent lighting both cameras display quite a strong colour cast with the auto setting, although the pink cast of the image taken with the canon is slightly more disturbing than the amber cast present in the images from the d3s.
as far as preset styles are concerned, the 1d mkiv has more to choose from, but both cameras have three customisable settings that can be tailored to your requirements.
quick exposure compensation adjustments can be applied in either shutter or aperture priority modes by turning the rear dial, which is excellent for shooting under rapidly changing conditions.
that being said, within the same price range, either brand can produce fantastic photos.
i'm pretty sure this is not true, the d3s supports cf type i only, you can verify this on the official nikon web site.
taking a custom white balance reading from the white background in the photograph, the canon still displays a magenta cast, whilst the image taken with the nikon is neutral, just like the image taken in daylight.
handling from a distance, if the manufacturer's logos were obscured, it would be very difficult to tell each camera apart, save for the red flash on the grip of the d3s. both cameras are virtually the same size and weight, and the extra 60g the d3s weighs over the canon is virtually imperceivable.
the 2300mah lp-e4 battery comes as one unit with the clip attached permanently, making quick battery changes straightforward.
the reason this is a big deal is that it means compactflash to sd adapters will not fit in the d3s, meaning the eye-fi card will not fit, so the only way to wirelessly transfer photos from the d3s is with the official nikon wireless peripheral.
it really shows its worth when shooting brightly coloured objects, which may lead to overexposure on traditional luminance based metering systems.
spot metering also performs well in either setup, although my personal preference is to have it follow the af point.
some of the canon lenses were better than the same nikon lenses and vice versa.
overall the canon's evaluative metering work well, producing balanced exposures in a wide range of conditions.
the same 1/8000sec top shutter speed is matched by the d3s. evaluative metering does a decent job of keeping reasonable detail in this strongly backlit subject.
a wide viewfinder eyepiece is very easy to use when wearing spectacles, and the dioptre adjustment is located on the side of the prism.
keep it up, but next time use my lens instead of the one you did.
the viewfinder magnification is slightly less than that of the canon, so the viewfinder appears roughly the same size, even thought the sensor is larger.
if however, you have a large investment in lenses, the difference isn't so great that it would be worth ditching the lot.
due to nikon's line of battery grips, which are compatible with the same en-el4a battery, the battery cover comes separate to the battery block and needs to be removed when changing batteries (unless you purchase spares).
to me, this is a better system, as it prevents the camera from hiking the iso to ridiculous levels suddenly, giving you a nasty noisy shock when you inspect your pictures later on.
i bought the canon at that time as i got a better deal from the owner of the shop than i could get on the nikon.

had not even heard of the canon alo so many many thanks, i will go and look that up.
also the location of the pc socket can occasionally lead to the connection becoming loose when using the camera in portrait orientation, as it is very easy to nudge it when supporting the lens with your hand.
the image quality produced by it is also superb, with vibrant punchy colours and low noise compared to many other cameras available today.

to be fair the biggest issue i had was waiting for the buses.
it does perform very well in fact.
when viewed from the rear, the large selector dial sets the canon apart fro the nikon, as does the design of the viewfinder eyepiece, with nikon opting for a larger circular design.
some of the shots, especially those taken as the bus got closer are slightly behind the target.

i did get excellent photos with the rig, blowing some up to 30x40" size for exhibits.
well done for comparing all those technical specs - it does make choosing between camera bodies a lot less of a chore.
from here onwards the levels of noise gradually start to increase, with a noticeable amount of luminance noise being present at 100% in images taken at iso3200 and fine details being softened slightly as a result.
at iso25600, images are acceptable for small print reproduction and the web, as are images taken at iso51200, although they are beginning to look much much snowy at this setting.
this at least fills the "film" area with about the same amount of the subject.
turning the iso up a notch to iso12800 results in a light amount of softening due to noise reduction, but detail and contrast still remain good for reproduction at decent sizes in print.
the viewfinder display is more pleasant to use on the canon, as the more simple battery design, but for me, the dual memory card formats and placement of the joystick controller let it down somewhat.
in the images from the id mkiv the samples below processed in capture one do retain slightly more detail, but also display much higher levels of chroma noise.
information on the d3s viewfinder is also clearly displayed, although the af points can be a little more difficult to see and there is no battery or file format information.

a connection for a remote release and a pc flash socket are located on the front.
id say both cameras are as good as each other and nothing to chose from them, the only thing i notice is the last photo of the canal is the canon photo is better than the nikon, when its enlarge to maximum size you can read the plaque on the wall near the gas bottles on the canon photo, but with the nikon its burled this may be down to the lens that been used?
my advice to anyone contemplating buying a d3s who is worried by this test would be to try the camera with one of nikon's f2.8 zooms such as the 24-70 and you will find it very effective at 50mm.
image up to iso12800 will do for many forms of reproduction.
other controls are very well placed, and although the buttons aren't overly large, they can be operated easily enough with gloves, as they stand proud from the camera body.
quality and capability can be bought.
easy exposure compensation can be enabled in the menu, allowing quick adjustment s to be made in aperture and shutter priority modes.
large rubber flaps cover the usb port, hdmi, microphone, av out and the mains power connection.
for the purpose of this test, it matters not one jot if that lens is weather sealed or not.
i would say the canon is better.
for example, in aperture priority mode you can set an ideal shutter speed value and maximum iso, and the camera will vary the sensitivity to achieve this where possible.
for that reason above all else, the nikon d3s would be my choice of the two cameras if i was starting from scratch.
although the nikon sports fewer pixels, images are still clear, sharp and packed with detail.
two things, to answer the quote first though, there are multiple reasons to use the wifi card in the canon or the attachments in either; i have a cloud repository on the web and by sending my photos to the cloud as they are taken, i can be sure the photos are available when i get home.
having tested both the lenses, they give very similar performance when stopped down beyond f/2, so no shots were taken during the test at apertures wider than f/2.
who cares how sharp a lens is at f1.2 if all you shoot is landscapes or races or sports events or even most news events.
there's an owl in the park nearby, but that's only active at night.
one comment in how the tests were shot: i find it very disconcerting trying to compare the photos taken, as it were, with apparently different focal lengths in the two cameras.

both cameras are incredibly well-built, as you might expect and you really have to look closely to find any clear differences.
looking more closely at the canon, connections for hdmi output, a microphone, remote release and a pc flash socket are all located on the outside edge under rubber flaps, which can be rotated out of harms way.

canon lcd and top controls.
nikon's auto iso feature is a little more advanced.
the colours produced by the nikon are more muted by comparison but plenty of controls are provided if you require a more vivid look.
even lighting is also dealt with very well by nikon's colour matrix metering.
have to say that i find the idea that canon can and nikon cannot track on oncoming bus a little bizarre.. and actually would have preferred to see the test carried out on perhaps a peregrine.
i can d/l them from the cloud to my computer and then process, returning them to the cloud when processed to preserve them.
in the event the test turned out in favour of the canon 1d it would not make the slightest bit in making me think i should have chosen canon instead.
hi-£, which is equivalent to iso102400 is probably best kept as a last resort as most fine detail has been obliterated by noise.

enough so that i blow up my photos to as large as 13x19 and sell them as art photos, mostly sunsets and cloudscapes.

yes yes construction magnesium alloy magnesium alloy weight 1180g 1240g firmware version 1.1.0 1.01 it is clear to see, that there is little to choose between the two cameras on paper, which is to be expected as both cameras are right on the bleeding edge of technology for this type of camera.
evaluative metering is flawless in evenly lit scenarios.
having the ability to take images of acceptable quality at such high sensitivities could mean the difference between an image sale, or as anne robinson would say, leaving with nothing.

the eye-fi card, which is currently the most convenient way to immediately get photos onto the internet from an slr, is sd-only, so having both types of slots gives you the speed of top-of-the-line compactflash, while having the eye-fi card in slot 2 uploading photos, this is not possible on the d3s.

and then we'd have people complaining that the lenses have different characteristics etc i've a d3 and a f1.4/50 afs.
both viewfinders have a counter showing how many shots remain in the buffer, which is especially useful given the high frame rates of both cameras.
starting with the canon, in the first test images up to iso800 show no significant signs of noise, or softening due to noise reduction.
the cameras are so similar and both great; they rule over each other in different areas but in such a slight amount i hardly think it would matter.

both manufacturers offer dedicated wifi transmitters so it isn't like the nikon would lack the ability to transmit via wifi, just the solution might be a bit bulkier and more expensive.
af points are illuminated bright red when activated and disappear almost completely from view when not in use, providing a clear view for composition.
the information is clearer and the af points are easier to see and select.
quote: one comment in how the tests were shot: i find it very disconcerting trying to compare the photos taken, as it were, with apparently different focal lengths in the two cameras.
in the end, i'd just go with the less-expensive one.
the major separator between the two cameras is the size of the sensor.
most lenses will give good optical performance when stopped down.
af points also light up red on this camera, but are not as bright as those on the canon, and are much smaller in the viewfinder, which can sometimes make them difficult to see by comparison.
i also use lenses from other manufacturers as i've found that their lenses are as good for my use as either the canon or nikon lenses.
for example, a 300mm lens on the canon will give roughly the same view as a 400mm lens on the nikon.
luckily the battery lasts an age on each charge.
with the nikon images taken at this setting clearly contain more detail and less noise, especially if processed from a raw file.
that's not to say the canon performs badly.
subtle tones are rendered well and dynamic range is decent.
when it was being photographed, the bus was as close as a few feet from me, travelling at around 30mph.

other than that, all the buttons and controls are easily accessible making the camera very easy to use under pressure.
in this test the 1d mkiv performed especially well.
if i lose or drop the camera, i still have the photos.
the d3s renders colours less vividly in the standard picture mode.
interesting from an academic point of view for me.
the colour matrix metering system opts to retain more detail in the highlights in this scenario, almost silhouetting the subject.
i sold cameras years ago and tested both the canon and the nikon cameras 0f that time.
i think, from long experience, that no matter what you say or how you carry out the testing, there is always going to be dispute of your results.
quote: have to say that i find the idea that canon can and nikon cannot track on oncoming bus a little bizarre.. and actually would have preferred to see the test carried out on perhaps a peregrine.
i feel that for a fair test, the nikon should have been fitted with a 75mm or 80mm lens so that then sizes of the taken images were about the same.
with the lens removed, the larger lens mount of the canon is an obvious difference, as is the size of the viewfinder matte screen, which can be seen reflected in the reflex mirror.
even as the bus came close, it still managed to track focus adequately.
exposure for evaluating exposures, the 1d mkiv comes equipped with a 63-zone meter, which uses the selected af point in its exposure calculation.
in these kinds of scenarios, where the subject isn't backlit, the nikon tends to expose a little brighter, keeping more detail in the shadows.
i have used nikon for many years but have never owned a professional nikon (apart from a second hand f4s).
also, the lower resolution of the nikon, coupled with the larger sensor size results in larger photosites on the sensor, which should also result in better noise performance at high iso sensitivities.
use pretty much any other afs lens, including zooms, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with my nikon's focussing/tracking capability.

just as with the canon, soft rubber grips cover much of the exterior, making the camera very comfortable to hold.
the nikon d3s offers class leading performance at high iso settings, and features excellent dynamic range.
in harshly backlit conditions the meter works particularly well for an evaluative system, as it gives preference to the area focused on.
again, when stopped down to f/2 and beyond, the older lens and the newer one give similar performance.
however the placement of the small joystick controller means that it can be difficult to reach when shooting in portrait orientation, at least without some finger gymnastics to reach across the rear of the body.
when it is not possible to achieve the correct exposure with the parameters applied, then it will drop or raise the shutter speed to achieve the correct exposure.
canon's auto iso is very simple, providing a shutter speed that is safe for hand-holding the camera where possible in aperture priority and program modes, and the give the correctly metered exposure in shutter priority and manual modes.
canon eos 1d mkiv nikon d3s the canon does a decent job of keeping up with the moving bus, even when it gets close.
the buttons for menus and other features are nice and large, which makes operation with gloves bearable, although the iso, image quality and white balance controls could do with being larger, as they can be a little fiddly.
at the h2 and h3 settings, colour noise starts to become an issue and much of the fine detail is lost.
one socket for a compactflash card and one for an sd card are included.
good as it is though, when it comes to image quality factors such as noise at high sensitivities and dynamic range, it falls short when compared to the nikon d3s. for a professional, for who these camera are aimed at, it's the final result that counts.
they can also be configured so that one card receives raw files, whilst the other receives jpeg images, or videos.
i once had an f1.2-75mm lens for a canon rangefinder when i was shooting low light in clubs, bars, theaters, etc.

both cameras can capture impressive levels of dynamic range, but the greater detail can be seen in the highlights of images taken with the d3s, especially in raw files from the camera, where even more detail can be retrieved using highlight recovery.
viewfinder the viewfinder eyepiece on the canon protrudes quite a distance from the body, which reduces the chance of pressing controls with your face or nose, especially if you are a left-eye shooter.
but it strikes me as a bit odd having to carry two separate card formats to use this facility.
canon eos 1d mkiv nikon d3s colours are vibrant, without looking unnatural in the standard picture mode.
noise to evaluate the iso capabilities of each camera's images were first taken on a tripod at each iso setting under low light conditions, than each camera was taken to a dimly lit bar where shots of a live music performance were taken at iso sensitivities of iso400 and greater.
performance both cameras were put through their paces in a variety of conditions and all images were taken in raw + jpeg for comparison.
the working range of this meter is 0-20 ev at 23 degrees with a 50mm f/1.4 lens, which should ensure good performance in low light conditions.
changing the 2500mah en-el4a battery can be a bit fiddly, as the weather sealed clip has to be detached.
the smaller viewfinder reflection in the mirror of the canon is due to the smaller aps-h sensor.
i think everyone is too impressed by the names, canon & nikon, to look objectively into other name lenses.
for the purposes of this comparison, the latest firmware has been installed on each camera.
it would've been nice to have the newer f/1.4 available for the nikon,but, for practical reasons, this wasn't possible.
one additional issue, in your specifications comparison you say the nikon d3s can take compactflash type i and ii cards, "compactflash i and ii, dual slot".
as far as handling is concerned, both cameras feel excellent to use and are built to exceptionally high standards.
pushing the sensitivity beyond the camera's native range results in visibly higher levels of noise and loss of fine detail, although shots taken at iso25600 still keep chroma noise to levels which aren't too disturbing, which is excellent performance for such a high iso and images at this setting should be fine for reproduction in less critical applications, such as for the web, or at small sizes in newspapers or magazines.
another reason to use wifi is that i have a notebook with wifi and bluetooth.
a top shutter speed of 1/8000 will freeze even the fastest motion.
basic features like information screens and memory card slots are very similarly designed on both cameras.
in my view, "it ain't the box."
there are large dark areas of the front of each bus - dark areas are not the best af targets.
plenty of controls are provided if you require more punchy colours.
the nikon fanatics are going to say that "this nikon lens is much better than the canon lens you used, why didn't you use that?" & the canon users are going to make claims that the canon is much better than the nikon in such and such a test, regardless what your tests show, or you didn't give the canon a fair shake because you conducted the test in this manner rather than that.
the nikon gets most images in focus, but occasionally one or two are behind the target, especially as the bus gets close.
again this is another close call, and although the canon's evaluative meter gives more satisfactory results in harshly backlit conditions, nikon's implementation of auto iso wins it for me.
i could transmit the photos to the laptop to preserve them and also to process some in the field if i so desired.
any way, good job of work, i know it takes a lot of time to do this sort of thing.
canon eos 1d mkiv nikon d3s scenes with high contrast subjects tend to retain good detail in the highlights, at the expense of detail in the shadows with the canon.
using a double decker bus for each sequence would have eliminated a possible apples and oranges aspect.
the nikon did track the bus, just not as well.
we used the af-d version, which focuses much faster.
i agree with the conclusion, love the d3s, but just wanted to note there actually is a big advantage to having both a compactflash and sd card on the canon.
the remote release and pc sync socket are located separately on the front, also protected by individual rubber covers.
nikon's 14-24mm f/2.8 lens has garnered a superb reputation and is perfect for getting in close to the action.
at the end of the day, it was a test of focus, so a moving subject was needed.
not one frame is out of focus from a burst of 17 shots.
the viewfinder eyepiece provides plenty of nose clearance.

in focus areas are more clearly defined whilst levels of chroma noise seem to be kept to reasonable levels.
in daylight both cameras produce similar neutral results using the auto white balance setting.
each day click on a window to unveil new photography tips, treats and techniques.
advances in sensor technology in the last year or so have produced cameras that are able to take images in incredibly difficult condition, at very high sensitivities, that just wouldn't have been possible with film.
at h3 the amount of colour noise present is visible even at small sizes so this setting is probably best avoided unless you have no choice.
on the d3s the viewfinder eyepiece doesn't protrude from the body as far as the canon, and so may not be as comfortable for left-eye shooters to use, especially as the multi selector and ae-l buttons are just to the right of the viewfinder.
