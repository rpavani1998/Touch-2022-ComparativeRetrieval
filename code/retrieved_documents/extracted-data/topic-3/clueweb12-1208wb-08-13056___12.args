take a look at this image, shot in vividly full daylight: the d7000 did a nice job picking an exposure to average out the very wide-ranging exposure.
single servo focus, for locking on to something and staying put while you recompose or wait for the right moment.

it can be distractingly eager to focus on things all over the place, which is why nikon allows for it to be disabled.
the af-f setting, for theoretically tracking moving objects, has a long way to go before it’s anything like the 3d 39-point super-system the camera uses for still image focus tracking.
the d7000 actually goes a step further by adding a new setting.
it will make a great vacation camera for families, and will not disappoint serious photographers with its controls, ergonomics, or capture dynamic range.
it is very similar to the high-powered systems in professional nikons like the d3 i use in my studio.
moving the point manually, which is an easily accessible option and uses the 4-way rocker on the camera’s back, allows a photographer to select a specific point (for example, a portrait subject’s closest eye) and do less focus-and-recompose.
with easy creative controls, a wide dynamic range, great autofocus, and a wide selection of available lenses, it’ll make a great vacation camera.
choose from the middle 21, allowing a bit bigger area than the middle 9.
while in video record mode, the same autofocus setting button (found in the center of the d7000′s af/mf switch on the camera’s front) choses between options for the size of the autofocus area and face-detection (front control wheel) and single servo or full-time servo (rear control wheel).
with the full 3d setting engaged, you may never think about focusing again; it works great.
the specific spot on which the camera attempts to focus can be selected from any of these.
my three-year-old, joey, and i had to check in on a gallery display of mine, and what better excuse to jump on the bart train and hit the streets around union square.
semi-competitor, sony, has addressed this issue by creating cameras with a semi-transluscent mirror that direct some light both to the sensor and the autofocus points (like the a-580 we are reviewing).
by clicking our links first and then purchasing the items as we then get a small portion of the sale to help run the website.
to the classic nikon “prosumer” niche (think d70, d80, d90…) the d7000 adds fun, easy, and respectable video recording, with autofocus and optional manual control.
video autofocus does not use the same sensors as still capture.
nikon’s already best-in-class still capture autofocus.
take a look at the same file with a few quick adjustments: lightroom’s handy tools for exposure: exposure, recovery, fill light, blacks, brightness, etc.
it works flawlessly on the d7000, locking on to whoever may be in front of the camera and keeping things sharp.
the d7000 has fantastic dynamic range.

a particular strength is the d7000′s flexible, customizable, and very effective autofocus system.
etc. make it a quick process to reign in a wild file, to be sure, but, it’s not helpful unless there is detail for which to dig.

autofocus autofocus is, perhaps, the nikon d7000‘s greatest strength when compared to similar cameras from other manufacturers.
note: all images for this post were shot with a nikon d7000 and its 18-105mm dx vr kit lens the nikon d7000 is a capable camera, both relatively compact, lightweight, and with a strong feature set.
and it does work better with the d7000 than ever before, which is good, but still not great compared to the old-school sensors.

we’ve noticed a bit more grain than expected when shooting at middle to high isos, but in good light, the camera does a great job.
nikon’s now established 3d tracking system lets the camera quick track and jump from subject to subject, even as distance from the camera changes drastically.
it’s also useful if you have foreground elements you’d like to not emphasize, like tree branches with a beautiful waterfall behind them (cameras tend to grab close subjects if possible besides manual point selection, the d7000 offers five methods to select its own point.
it is very similar to the high-powered systems in professional nikons like the d3 i use in my studio.
the 4-way rocker moves the point and the center ok button re-centers it, just as for still capture operation.
this was a raw capture, processed in adobe lightroom 3.0.
while some of the country is digging out from another snow storm, we had a warm, sunny day in san francisco.

the non-tracking af-s (auto focus-single-servo) works well and is a welcome addition to video capture (especially if you have an external mic, because autofocus is noisy!)

it also works when recording video.
nikon has tackled the problem, at least for now, by making contrast-detection autofocus, the variety that works by analyzing image data collected by the sensor, work better.
this strikes me as a good match for continuous-servo focusing with an active subject, like a pet or child.
turning it off gives the camera a brief moment of hesitation while it tries to stay roughly on the same plane.
it’s a great camera for a day in the city, which is exactly how we’ve tested it on day 4!
the camera is able to record clean detail from the brightest of scenes to the shadows.
