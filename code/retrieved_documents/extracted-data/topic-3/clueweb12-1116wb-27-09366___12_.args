stripe filter array lcd is more expensive but suits display geometrical data better (character, cg, line).none of these comments have included hard proof of this (spec sheets, links to canon or other data, etc.), but that doesn't stop the opinions from declaring that i'm wrong, and nikon's d3 and d300 screens with 920,000 dots are actually twice as sharp as previous 230,000 pixel lcds (including nikon's d2xs screen).(not 320x240x3) stripe filter array lcd is more expensive but suits display geometrical data better (character, cg, line).almost all dsc use delta array lcd because of lower cost.the advantage of stripe over triad rgb is that it let out more backlight allowing the display to look brighter.for example, a camera with a 3-inch, 230,000 pixel resolution monitor (such the new canon eos 40d or eos 1 ds mark iii) gets that 230k figure by multiplying its vertical by horizontal pixel counts in the same way cameras often list their effective megapixel resolution by multiplying the sensor’s horizontal and vertical pixel counts.this helps to explain why a digital file with 200 ppi res can be printed at 600-5400 dpi depending on the printer and its output settings.)on the other hand, most camera and camcorder lcd monitors are compared using the product of the horizontal and vertical pixels.it does not mean that what you get is high definition just a brighter and maybe cleaner example of a typical 320x240 vga display.(however, to describe the unique foveon sensor in its cameras, sigma uses the total number of sub-pixels found in the three overlapping rgb layers to total the sd14’s megapixel count—a controversial practice).for example, a 17-inch laptop monitor might have a maximum resolution of 1280x1024-pixels (a very common resolution also called sxga–super extended graphics array).unfortunately, many reviewers missed that and erroneously thought that the lcd had a super-high 920,000-pixel resolution—which would make it twice as sharp as the 230,000-pixel monitors on the new canons (remember, it takes 4x as many pixels in a two dimensional array to equal twice the resolution).frankly, i wish nikon would stick to the pixel method of describing lcd monitor resolution, or that all manufacturers would agree to use dots but then describe the actual horizontal and vertical pixel dimensions of the screen (as nikon did by giving the vga tag).this is true for all nikon and canon cameras using the delta array lcd's.incidentally, the relationship between the number of pixels and the number of dots is that: three dots of consecutive r, g, and b dots constitute one pixel in a display by three primary colors, r, g, and b.
