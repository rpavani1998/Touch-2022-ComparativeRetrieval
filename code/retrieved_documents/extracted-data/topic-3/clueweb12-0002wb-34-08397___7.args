this is particularly useful if you are shooting in different formats, or you don't want the risk of putting all your images on just one card.
while both cameras allow the users to pick a single af point, the nikon also allows for nine-, 21-, and 39-point dynamic area af.
not only does it offer the first dslr flip-out lcd screen, but the screen has more resolution than the nikon.
this is probably because nikons tend to run a little bright on colors, which reflects back into the problem.
the nikon is made from magnesium alloy, and is certainly a far more suitable camera if you intend to shoot outside in disagreeable weather conditions.
resolution, controls, and body the canon wins hands-down on resolution, offering 18mp to nikon's 16.2mp.
it's also proportioned at 3:2, which means that it displays images at a more natural ratio.
i would, however, recommend the nikon if you plan to work in inhospitable conditions (as it's far more solid) or are only ever going to shoot in jpeg.
hd movie mode while both cameras offer an hd movie mode, only the canon can shoot at 30fps.
but, even though the canon is made of plastic, it's both bigger and heavier than the nikon.
the nikon, however, produces much better color rendition in jpeg format than the canon, although both produce stunningraw images.
for those new to dslrs, it's an easier camera to begin using well straight out of the box.
and if you're interested in making movies, the canon has far more options.
once you, as a photographer, become tied into one system, you'll probably become fairly fanatical about it!
i'll take a look at the key points on each camera to help you make a better informed decision.
the canon is made from a plastic shell (a vast departure from its predecessor, the 50d, which was made from magnesium alloy).
but, even though the canon is made of plastic, it's both bigger and heavier than the nikon.
but the nikon does allow autofocus during movie recording.
lcd screen the canon is by far the better camera in the lcd department.
if you're not tied into a system, the choice of cameras can seem bewildering.

when it comes to controls, neither of the cameras is perfect.
and if you're interested in making movies, the canon has far more options.
like the nikon, it also has several customizable buttons.

image quality both cameras perform well at high isos, giving printable results even at iso 6400.
in conclusion in my mind, the canon 60d just edges the nikon d7000 because of its slightly superior image quality and less fiddly controls.
nikon has yet again put theiso button in a "fiddly" position, where it can't be changed while the camera is at eye-level.
both cameras have comfortable hand grips.
both cameras have a tendency to overexpose in high-contrast situations, although it's definitely more noticeable on the nikon by quite a large degree.

the nikon is restricted to 24fps in hd mode.

more importantly, there is a big difference in the bodies' construction.
if i were being totally objective, though, i would say that nikon bodies tend to be marginally tougher and better laid-out, while canon lenses still have the edge optically.
in this department, the nikon is king.
the canon wins hands-down on resolution, offering 18mp to nikon's 16.2mp.
like the nikon, it also has several customizable buttons.
while both cameras offer an hd movie mode, only the canon can shoot at 30fps.
the canon is by far the better camera in the lcd department.
it does benefit from a "q" button, which takes users into the q menu screen, which lists the key shooting parameters.
it's also proportioned at 3:2, which means that it displays images at a more natural ratio.

both cameras will accept the new sdxc cards, which allow users up to 2tbs of space!
however, the nikon has two sd card slots, which is a great addition.
