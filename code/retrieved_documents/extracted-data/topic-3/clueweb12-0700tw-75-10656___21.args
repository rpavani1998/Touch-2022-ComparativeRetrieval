the nikon d4, by comparison, does quite a bit better, with a similar, if smaller, rendition of the mosaic tile, and a better version of the red leaf swatch.
the top layer is sensitive to red and green, while the bottom layer detects blue and green.
it's still a decent performance from the a77, but the 5d mark iii clearly has an advantage.
for example, you could save full-res raws on one card, and reduced-res mraws on the other.

it also has a more rugged shoe mount, and ships with a gel filter holder and tungsten / fluorescent filters.
the canon hs system takes the frustration out of low-light photography.
the 5d mark iii's image is crisp compared to the grainy and soft 7d at iso 1,600.
although the target market is clearly experienced photographers, the 5d mark iii caters to the occasional time when you want to lend your camera to a less-experienced photographer, perhaps to get in the shot yourself.
the exception is the red leaf swatch, which while somewhat cartoonish in the 5d mark ii's rendering, is softer from the 5d mark iii.
menu and info buttons are well-placed on the upper left side of the lcd.
the remaining points are horizontal line-types, sensitive to f/5.6.
this full-color metering allows better subject detection, information which is also fed back to the autofocus system to further aid subject tracking.
images from the d3x are quite a bit grainier, but again the image is very even across disparate elements.
five buttons left of the lcd are creative style, a new rate button, a zoom button, and finally the playback and delete buttons.
the canon retains more of the vibrant color in the red swatch, and its rendering of the pink swatch has more detail and gets the color closer to correct, while the a77 makes it look more purple.
menu and info buttons are well-placed on the upper left side of the lcd.
the top deck includes a mode dial with the auto+ mode, combined from the creative auto and green zone modes on the 5d mark ii.
for example, you could save full-res raws on one card, and reduced-res mraws on the other.
we also choose 1,600 because we like to be able to shoot at least at this level when indoors and at night.
nikon's 24 megapixel d3x turns the previous assessment on its head a bit, as the d3x probably picks up a bit more detail than the 5d mark iii.
the superior resolution of the sony a77 is lost a bit to noise suppression in the smaller sensor, particularly noticeable in the shadows and the dark mosaic background.
the 600ex-rt has a guide number of 60 meters / 197 feet at maximum zoom, and has a zoom range of 20 to 200mm.
most digital slrs and cscs will produce an excellent iso 100 shot, so we like to push them and see what they can do compared to other cameras at iso 1,600, 3,200, and 6,400.

as in that camera, there are 41 cross-type points, of which 20 work to f/4.0, and 21 are f/5.6 capable.
also new since the 5d mark ii is canon's ai servo iii, which is quicker to start tracking your subject, and should handle momentary obstructions between camera and subject more gracefully.
as if to underscore the advantage of full frame and canon's recent advancement, the canon 7d's iso 3,200 images are even fuzzier, seen as if through frosted glass by comparison.
also, because the 5d mark iii is a beta unit, keep in mind image quality may not be representative of final production models.
the grip is sized right for the camera body, though somewhat large for small hands; it fit my medium-sized hands comfortably.
the d4 image is a bit grainier, however, particularly in the shadows.
the grip is sized right for the camera body, though somewhat large for small hands; it fit my medium-sized hands comfortably.
for the first time in an eos model other than the 1-series, the 5d mark iii can now capture 2, 3, 5, or 7 shots in a bracketed sequence.
just like the 1d x, you can combine up to nine frames into a single exposure in-camera.
canon specs the body weight at 30.3 ounces (860g) body only.
the lcd itself is a 3:2 aspect ratio design that's just as gorgeous as recent models have been, with a 1.04-million dot array.
interestingly--and unsurprisingly--the d4 does a little better with the red leaf swatch at iso 100, but misses the texture of the pink swatch beneath.
this can be approximately doubled by shooting with two packs, using the bg-e11 battery grip.
among the user requests that canon has heard and answered with the 5d mark iii, there's now a side-by-side comparative playback display (including synced magnification and a histogram function), plus the ability to manually set the first four characters of image file names.
as well as enabling faster 6 fps burst shooting, there's also more power for noise reduction, and canon is predicting a two-stop improvement for jpeg shooting.
the mosaic crop is noticeably sharper, and the pink swatch has excellent detail, and the red leaf swatch is pretty respectable.
thanks to its full-frame sensor, there's no focal length crop.
this refers to a built-in database that allows automatic correction of both spherical and chromatic aberration, astigmatism, curvature of field, diffraction, and low-pass filter effects.
lower left of the lcd are three holes for the speaker, and a small window for the ambient light sensor, used to automatically adjust the lcd backlight.
even so, keeping with canon tradition, many buttons have shuffled around, and new ones created.
15 radio channels are available (plus auto), and up to 15 speedlite flashes can be used on a channel, in as many as five groups, with each group separately able to be set to e-ttl or controlled manually.
we'll go over the other features in more detail below, but the canon 5d mark iii also includes a 150,000-cycle shutter rating; a new hdr mode; full hd, 1080p video at 24, 25, and 30 frames per second; a 3.2-inch, 1.04m-dot lcd; a new cmos sensor with higher sensitivity and an eight-channel readout that allows a 6-frame-per-second frame rate; a quick control dial that includes touch capability for silent adjustments while in video mode; multiple raw image sizes; 100-percent viewfinder coverage with an adjustable lcd grid and af overlay; a 1.5 percent spot meter; a dual-axis leveling system; and standard or quiet operation modes.
