the autofocus, exposure, flash, long-exposure noise, and color saturation performance of this camera are superb.once you learn how all the controls interact and find the settings that work for the situations you photograph, you'll find that the new autofocus system is fast, sure, and reliable.acuity is good, color is excellent, and noise performance is at least as good as previous nikons, if not better.an interval timer has been added to allow time-lapse and unattended photography.the autofocus system is completely new, quite complex, and versatile.i'm impressed that nikon has taken the time to try to improve, refine, and innovate in as many places as it has.second, the fact that nikon uses dual-channel processing on the chip is what gives the camera the ability to run at 8 frames per second.with the right settings and discipline, this camera performs more like a 5mp or higher camera.autofocus performance is superb, though requires learning to use well.since white balance is easier to master on this camera than previous nikon dslrs, it all adds up to getting solid color results for those paying attention.if you were confused by single area af versus dynamic area af, you're going to need to study these new controls--they add a great degree of choice to your autofocus options, but they are not obviously intuitive, even to veteran nikon users.a hot mirror filter does seem to eradicate the problem, at the expense of small light loss overall.the bottom line remains the same, however: nikon has produced a sensor of their own design, and it's competitive with other technologies.others on the net have noted that use of a hot mirror filter (filters out near ir) changes the camera's noise and color tendencies with certain fabrics and objects.flash is much better with i-ttl than it is with d-ttl, and you have more control and multiple flash ttl with the new system.
