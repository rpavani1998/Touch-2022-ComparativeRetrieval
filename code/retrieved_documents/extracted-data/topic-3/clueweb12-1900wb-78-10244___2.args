in the us, the ixus range is known as the powershot digital elph series - confirming that, in some cases, the camera's name won't always dictate its ability.
the canon eos 5d mk ii costs less than any other full-frame dslr on the market, including thesony a850 ornikon d700.
part sealed for protection against the elements, the 18mp eos 60d is a step closer to a sturdy professional camera outfit.
the 18.1mp full-frame sensor can churn out images at 12fps (14fps in high speed mode) and offers other mind-bending features such as extended sensitivity up to iso 204,800 and a 61-point autofocus system.
add a 10fps burst mode and 45-point autofocus system with 39 cross-type sensors and there's no doubting this is an exceptional camera for shooting moving subjects.

a focusing system with 19 cross-type focus points mean the camera zips onto subjects in portrait or landscape orientation, and the 8fps continuous shooting mode is far quicker than the 60d's 5.3fps burst.
so if you've always wanted to experience shooting with a full-frame camera then there's no better introduction than this superb camera.
