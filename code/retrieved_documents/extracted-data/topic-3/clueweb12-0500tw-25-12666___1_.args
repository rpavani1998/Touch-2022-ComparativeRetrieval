full-frame cameras, by virtue of their large sensors, have much better low-light performance, color rendition, dynamic range (the range of levels it can show between highlight and shadow) than their aps-c cousins.a 36 megapixel imaging monster, this camera delivers almost every conceivable video option and then some.improved metering which allows better scene recognition, including face detection.cameras in this bracket have virtually identical image quality (iq).something that its competitor- the nikon d700 completely lacked; a higher megapixel sensor, and was overall lighter than the d700.you also tend to get shallower depth of field for the same aperture on a full-frame than on an aps-c camera.it had great video shooting capabilities-- improved metering which allows better scene recognition, including face detection.this makes it much better in terms of quickly turning on the camera and shooting.it’s specifications list is quite impressive: 36.3 megapixel full frame cmos sensor.improved weather sealing and durable magnesium alloy construction.a full-frame sensor (36mm x 24mm) has the same physical dimensions as 35mm film.it’s specifications list is quite impressive: - 36.3 megapixel full frame cmos sensor.improved durability, water and dust resistance.a few observations about the 5dm3′s design (based solely on the leaked pictures): canon has finally fixed the position of the on/off switch from near the back lower right of the lcd to the top of the camera, behind the main mode selector.
