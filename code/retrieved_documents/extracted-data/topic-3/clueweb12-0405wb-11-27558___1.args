overall, the dust removal system may mean a little less dust on the sensor, but since dust isn't that big a problem in the first place for most users...

i have the 18-70 kit lens which has afs, and it's quick and snappy on both cameras, whereas the old 70-300g lens hunts for focus on d70, d200 and f100.

well - if its ultrasound technology, i do assume it works.

i can't really comment on that, other than that i'm happy with the autofocus on the d70 and the d200.

i have to admit, though, that i very much like the nikon autofocus system in general.
the d100 or f100 are built like tanks, the d70 would have profited from a bit more environmental sealing.

it will be disturbed more by the actuation of the shutter and mirror movement.

i'm not in a bad situation now, the d200 being my primary camera, with the d70 as the backup body, should i need it.

on the other hand according to surveys, it noticeably changed their car's image.
i guess it will remove a little bit (the bits that are at the bottom of the sensor) each time it gets switched on.

i don't think it is any more important than canon's anti-dust feature.

there have been threads in this ng which pointed to galleries of sample pics.

putting a samyang 19-35 on a f100 and then complaining about the lousy sharpness and the heavy flaring.

i guess nikon thought that for the intended audience, a flash sync speed of 1/250 would be enough.
windshields aren't in the same sort of environlemt as a sensor in a dslr.
you can produce a picture with nikon that looks like a canon picture and vice versa.

the more you can do with an easily accessible dial or button the better.

imo, if you can't visualize such a grid, it probably doesn't matter.

and the sticky strip is smaller than the sensor, so the dust is more likely to stick on the sensor than on the strip.

the vibrations will stop, the dust will be in the air.
it just so happened that the nikons tended to feel good in my hands, the controls were in all the right places (with some exceptions, though nothing critical) and the weight and bulk felt "just right" for me.
i'm guessing the d80 is better but just wonder how much better.

by making >one surface vibrate you decerase the surface available for the dust.
dust doesn't fall neatly down, to stick to a vertical sticky strip.
some say that the color is more of a mutes pastel and appears richer.
both cameras are highly dependent on menus to access important settings.
which are the better optics.
mercedes even tested this technology for their windshields.
i can use the windshield washer to clean my windshield; i suppose the 8d will have a sensor washer.
comments please i think, both canon and nikon make very rugged cameras in the "higher class", and both make cameras that are less well built, but still very good.
i think, pick the camera that satisfies your requirements with respect to image quality, ease of use, flexibility, handling etc.
no matter what camera you buy, a better one for less money will be available in six months.
i think that by then nikon will wake up.
therefore the percentage of surface covered by the sticky strip increases.
so do i, but then cameras are aimed at a certain group of people (the companies of course want these groups to be as large as possible).
the d100 or f100 are built like tanks, the d70 would have profited from a bit more environmental sealing.
if you buy now, you get the benefit of what you buy.
we will be looking at the lower end, 350d/400d/d50/d70s/d80 and spend a bit on lenses.
just looking for any information that the experts can pass along.
i've watched dust (boredom is a terrible thing!); if the dust removal system were to be used in a situation where the camera was sitting in a table somewhere for several minutes after it was activated, maybe it would work.

the importance of good glass cannot be understated.
i still think it's not needed, and not very usefull.

mercedes says that it didn't work at all.

i absolutely love the on-demand grid lines, they help me a lot to keep my photos straight.
i think, the "mid-range" lenses (from a price point of view) that both manufacturers sell, are just great w.r.t.
but both cameras have menu settings which affect that considerably.

as i said, i've observed dust; it doesn't falll neatly down, especially when the air it's in is disturbed.
i've watched dust (boredom is a terrible thing!); if the dust removal >>system were to be used in a situation where the camera was sitting in >>a table somewhere for several minutes after it was activated, maybe it >>would work.
that is not a huge difference, but when canon claims to be more innovative, they are lying.
i admit, not much useful information, but i hope it helps a bit.

my impression is that canon cameras *by default* have more saturated color.
it just so happened that the nikons tended to feel good in my hands, the controls were in all the right places (with some exceptions, though nothing critical) and the weight and bulk felt "just right" for me.
i know the d80 is new and i'm not even sure you can buy one yet.
i absolutely love the on-demand grid lines, they help me a lot to keep my photos straight.
the shaking of the sensor occurs when the camera is turned on, meaning it's probably in motion, and the air will be disturbed by the camera's motion.
