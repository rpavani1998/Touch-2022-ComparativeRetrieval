thenikon 50mm 1.8d  has an aperture ring, which i needed for this camera.
and it’s so true that the concern about wasting film combined with the inability to review the shot makes you much more careful about composition, aperture, and shutter speed.
it was an interesting learning experience.
it was a journey, ill be shooting more film really soon actually pingback: how shooting film is helping me improve my photography at the phoblographer | gservo's photography pingback: 7 things i do to prepare for a long day of photography at the phoblographer pingback: review: oben ac-1400 4-section aluminum tripod with ba-00 ball head at the phoblographer enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.

for my first foray in to slr film photography, i chose the 50mm because i am comfortable with it, and i have only used it digitally.

the slightest mistake will waste a frame.
it felt like a fine way to refine my photography.
i worried about: what to shoot, what i actually wanted to shoot, and the cost of it all if i messed up.
the camera, a used nikon n2020 from b&h, worked much better than expected.
my inability to see the shots immediately drove me mad at times.
i remember a story by art wolf on when he was in the himalayan mountains and had to wait until he got home to see what he shot.
the nikon n2020/f501 slr is something i bought because of its features.
this inspired me to do this more with my digital photography as well.
film forced me to put more thought into my shots; i couldn’t go shutter-crazy.
when it originally came out, the nikon n2020 was a decently priced entry-level film camera with dual auto focus.
film teaches patience which gave me the ability to really observe the grandeur of the world around you.
really, really enjoy the color and contrast in the coffee shot!
this year i hit a point in my photography where i had learned a great deal, but i realized that i needed something to challenge me.

prints in hand, i was amazed all the images developed.
since it isn’t too advanced, the was familiar enough for me as a digital user to get the hang of it.
thanks for reading, glad you enjoyed nice, why f/n 80 as a budget camera it`s also cheap.
the first roll, which recently got developed, came out better than expected.
frankly, i did not decide on a proper film developer though as i went to a basic local printer.

the slightest mistake will waste a frame.
from research, i knew this kodak film would give me great color and sharpness.
more over, i think that shooting film is about taking the ultimate chance as well.
digital spoils you with that ability.

i questioned my knowledge and found it tough not being able to look at the image right away.
i remember a story by art wolf on when he was in the himalayan mountains and had to wait until he got home to see what he shot.
for speed, convenience, and cost, digital.
shooting & developing i took my time with the kodak gold 200 because i did not want to waste any frames.
the camera and film worked well together.
i questioned my knowledge and found it tough not being able to look at the image right away.
i chose the n2020/f501 because, honestly, it felt right.
which probably means that i need to get out of winter photo-hibernation and put myself through film boot camp again… you’ll love it.
