they split the medium format film market with mamiya, whose cameras are seen more as studio cameras.

i read something on the net a while back that pentax  wants to revive the concept / name with a digital version.

canon and sony are the only  ones left with optical viewfinders in their p&s cameras, and even  those two are reducing the number of models with it.
on cameras that support it they will use sdm and on older cameras they'll revert to the old screwdrive af.
