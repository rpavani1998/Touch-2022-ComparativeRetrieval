this may be a dedicated depth of field preview button.
- price (rumored): $3,500.
there is a new ‘rate’ button, second from top in the row of buttons on the left side of the lcd.
price (rumored): $3,500.
- full hd 1080 movie.
this post is a quick comparison between the latest nikon and canon  full-frame digital slrs.
i have a feeling that nikon and canon secretly discuss amongst themselves as to who will lead the professional pack for the next few years.
full-frame cameras, by virtue of their large sensors, have much better  low-light performance, color rendition, dynamic range (the range of levels it  can show between highlight and shadow) than their aps-c cousins.
which one of them will make you take better pictures?
- the ‘menu and info buttons have moved up from their previous positions to the left of the viewfinder.
something that its competitor- the nikon d700 completely lacked; a higher megapixel sensor, and was overall lighter than the d700.

high dynamic range (hdr) mode.
this makes it much better in terms of quickly turning on the camera  and shooting.
battle of the heavyweights: nikon d800 vs canon 5d mark iii march 1, 2012 – 12:53 pm posted in equipment, photography tagged 5d mark iii, advanced, canon, d800, gear, nikon, photography, review this keeps happening every few years.
shutter durability of 150,000 cycles.
the differences are more for their handling and features over and above great iq.
- improved metering which allows better scene recognition, including face detection.
apart from that, the top bank of buttons near the top lcd are the same.
my comparison of the feature set of these two photography stalwarts coming  up.
5 fps with battery grip, 6 fps in dx mode.
a full-frame sensor (36mm x 24mm) has the same physical dimensions as 35mm film.
- shutter durability of 150,000 cycles.
- quiet shooting mode.
a full-frame sensor (36mm x 24mm) has the same physical  dimensions as 35mm film.
the ‘eos 5d’ badge is more 7d like.
- new af module capable of focusing at low light down to -2ev.
- the top adds a ‘m-fn’ button (multi-function?
full hd 1080 movie, including raw hd output over hdmi.
there is  also an additional (probably picture control) button between the selector wheel  and joystick at the back.
the  d700 did have a superior autofocus (af) system, but that was really about it.
basically most of the reasons why you choose a dslr over a pocket point-and-shoot.
- 4.0 frames per second continuous shooting.
most consumer dslrs have smaller sensors, called aps-c  sensors (25mm x 16mm, which stands for advanced photo system type-classic).
full-frames tend to be heavier, and much more expensive  (around twice or more) than their smaller frame counterparts.

iso 100-25600 (expandable l: 50 to h2: 102400).
this seems to be a dedicated video recording button.
- full hd 1080 movie, including raw hd output over hdmi.
- 6.0 frames per second continuous shooting.
you also tend to get shallower depth of field for the same aperture on a full-frame than on an aps-c camera.
the  differences are more for their handling and features over and above great iq.
a new ‘start/stop’ button has been added to the right side of  the viewfinder.
an additional button added to the front, at approximately 8 o’clock  when the mount is viewed from the front.

quiet shooting mode.
fx vs dx over the past few years, canon has absolutely dominated the full-frame digital slr market.
- 61 point autofocus, up to 41 cross type sensors.
the d700 did have a superior autofocus (af) system, but that was really about it.
- 51 point autofocus with 15 cross-type sensors.
a few observations about the 5dm3′s design (based solely on the  leaked pictures): canon has finally fixed the position of the on/off switch from near the  back lower right of the lcd to the top of the camera, behind the main mode  selector.
51 point autofocus with 15 cross-type sensors.
tonight, canon will release their next iteration- the 5d mark iii.
- high dynamic range (hdr) mode.
last month, nikon came back roaring to release the d800.
61 point autofocus, up to 41 cross type sensors.

6.0 frames per second continuous shooting.
any further difference in pictures- almost always- is because of the person  using it, and not the camera.
shutter durability of 200,000 cycles.
depth of field  preview?) button close to the shutter release.

canon’s full-frame dslr- called the 5d mark2- till yesterday was by far the most popular full-frame camera.
high dynamic range (hdr) mode which combines multiple exposures upto +/-
improved durability, water and dust resistance.
you also  tend to get shallower depth of field for the same aperture on a full-frame than  on an aps-c camera.

nikon d800 nikon calls it a “hd-dslr”, for high definition dslr.
- an additional button added to the front, at approximately 8 o’clock when the mount is viewed from the front.
but first, a quick question- q-
my comparison of the feature set of these two photography stalwarts coming up.
- silent and low vibration shooting modes.
- improved weather sealing and durable magnesium alloy construction.
this makes it much better in terms of quickly turning on the camera and shooting.
it’s specifications list is quite impressive: 36.3 megapixel full frame cmos sensor.
apart from that, the top bank of  buttons near the top lcd are the same.
it had great video shooting capabilities-
improved metering which allows better scene recognition,  including face detection.
a 36 megapixel  imaging monster, this camera delivers almost every conceivable video option and  then some.
there is also an additional (probably picture control) button between the selector wheel and joystick at the back.
not to be outdone, here comes canon’s 5d mark iii (as yet unreleased): what is inside is equally as impressive: 22.3 megapixel full frame cmos sensor.
the information presented here is not official canon information, but a very reliable leak a few hours before the actual announcement.
