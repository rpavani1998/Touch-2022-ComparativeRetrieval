i missed a few shots that i would have love to have nailed but the lack of af really restricted me from getting the shot.
i mean it produces a perspective that is close to what the human eye sees.
it’s a very natural focal length and by that i mean it produces a perspective that is close to what the human eye sees.
canon 5d with zeiss 35mm f/4.0 - shot at iso 400, f/5.0, 1/125 sec i honestly thought this issue would come up before day 3 of the review, but it really reared its ugly head when i was out shooting in town.
and i’ll say it again, this lens produces images that have an unexplainable uniqueness to them; subjects seem to really pop from the background areas.
also, i enjoy having to slow down and put thought into what i’m shooting.
they allow you to zone focus or you can even preset your focus if you can guesstimate your distance from your subject before you bring the camera up to your face.
i’ve become so accustomed to af that i couldn’t react quickly enough in order to get the shot.
beyond the build quality and great looks, this lens produces excellent results.
while thecanon 5d does have a nice big and bright viewfinder, i cannot always tell when i have my subject 100% in focus.
i feel that this is important when reproducing photographs that depict everyday life.
canon 5d with zeiss 35mm f/4.0 - shot at iso 100, f/5.6, 1/800 sec now that i’ve had this lens for a few days, i’ve been able to feel out this lens’ strengths and weaknesses.
i’ve become so accustomed to af that i couldn’t react quickly enough in order to get the shot.
with a focal length of 35mm, thecarl zeiss distagon t* 35mm f/1.4 ze should feel right at home on the streets.
as i stated in the last post, without focus confirmation or a different focusing screen, i wouldn’t be able to use this lens.

if you shoot with a crop body, i would consider checking out thezeiss 35mm f/1.4 for your 50mm equivalent lens.
carrying this lens and a camera in your hand for an extended period of time can get old very quickly.
as i said in my last post, at over 3lbs., this lens has a bit of a weight problem.
canon 5d with zeiss 35mm f/1.4 - shot at iso 100, f/3.2, 1/2000 sec the carl zeiss distagon t* 35mm f/1.4 ze feels great mated to my 5d. a 35mm lens on a full frame body is great for environmental portraits and street photography.
this will drastically reduce your focus time once you have the camera up to your eye.
when paired with a crop body, thezeiss 35mm f/1.4 will end up being closer to a 50mm lens which is what i personally prefer to shoot with.
be sure to check back for day 4 of the review when we take the carl zeiss distagon t* 35mm f/1.4 ze to a birthday part.
don’t get me all wrong, the zeiss 35mm is not all bad.
as i said in my last post, at over 3lbs., this lens has a bit of a weight problem.

i have rediscovered that the markings on the lens can be your best friend.
the good part is it only has a few weaknesses and one of them is dealing with back-lit subjects.
but it is not as bad as some of the other lenses i’ve tested (e.g. sigma 85mm f/1.4).
so the lens has a hint of ca, i personally don’t have a problem with this because the lens excels in other areas that make ca a non-issue for me.

like most lenses, when you have a large amount of light pouring directly into the lens, your images are going to come out with less than ideal contrast and they will look washed out.
handling canon 5d with zeiss 35mm f/1.4 - shot at iso 400, f/7.1, 1/200 sec - no signs of flare after using the carl zeiss distagon t* 35mm f/1.4 ze for a few days, i’ve started to get used to having to manually focus all of the time.
as i said in the last post, chromatic aberration is apparent at the lenses widest apertures but it is not as bad as some of the other lenses i’ve tested (e.g. sigma 85mm f/1.4).
