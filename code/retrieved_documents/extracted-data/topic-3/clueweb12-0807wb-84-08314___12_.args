nikon also clearly learned from canon in that they got the camera into some pro shooters’ hands before its release: rolling shutter is either greatly improved from the d90 or it’s being expertly hidden in editing.for a pro on a budget.. - a camera with such an incredible range of interchangeable lenses - it is a good compromise for the time being.if you do have pro lenses then you will have amazing image quality and let's not forget that interchangeable lenses are available only on "real" video cameras at a much-much-much higher prices..nikon knows this, and has acted in such a way to present an attractive product.i'd say the smaller sensor, the low light sensitivity and the general lack of "beauty" in the image qualify too.it is much better to watch a nice edited, picture rich film than just some sample footage.picture quality is very beautiful (i tested it with nikon 50mm and 70-200mm 2.8 pro lenses and it is really-really sharp, and it is amazing that you can use 2.8 and get beautiful blurred background in video)however i hope nikon will make life easier later with better and easier pro control for shutter speed and allow the camera to use spot metering / centerand the d700's af system is much more advanced than the 5d's.another bad habit of this little cameras is their sensitivity for little vibrating wobbles, which can be reduced by adding weight.it also features limited autofocus in video mode.we shot a feature on the d90 and the time we spent trying to get the right exposure was a major drag, while we knew how to control jello and had learned from extensive testing exactly what and what not to expect from the codec, which we had decided was "good enough".i still think the gh1 is a way better value considering it has a flip-out lcd, full manual control, autofocus, shoots in 720p and 1080p, and has three different filmspeeds (24, 30, & 60fps) - all for $1500 with a pretty decent lens.the nikon d300s features 24p video at 1280x720, with an external microphone input.the d300s will auto-focus on a fixed point in the frame.
