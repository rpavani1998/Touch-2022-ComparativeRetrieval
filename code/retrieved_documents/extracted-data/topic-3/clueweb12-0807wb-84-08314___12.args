they are coming out with new cameras too fast.
cinematic black-and-white and lighting control for your iphone and ipad.
however i hope nikon will make life easier later with better and easier pro control for shutter speed and allow the camera to use spot metering / center
the d300s will auto-focus on a fixed point in the frame.
if the helicopter blades are an indication of the rolling shutter, then the problem is very minor.
50 mbps mjpeg would be awesome, much better than avchd or other interframe schemes for my purposes.
august 3, 2009 | sjur pollen the videos by bosch and vitale look a thousand percent better than the no-story story about vinnie allforme.
less jello due to increased processing power.
it costs you nothing and it really helps.
august 1, 2009 | brian the slumdog reverie?august 1, 2009 | trevor the rolling shutter artifacts were hidden.
this page hints that it might have some manual exposure control (thanks @tylerginter!).
features for the price, usability, practicality etc.
nikon imo looks more organic.
so if you want to capture war, then it is not your camera.
the bitrate could really use some help, i had a project where i was keying green out with d90 it really gave me trouble.
but the most important factor in "beauty" is person holding it.
i've been wanting to get my hands on one for some time but they are back ordered from panasonic it seems till september (according to most photo/video places in nyc at least).
my biggest problems with nikon are the lack of shutter control (flicker in pal 24/25) and the codec.
august 1, 2009 | sjur pollen oh, and supposedly better compression quality,august 1, 2009 | sjur pollen if more tests confirm this, then i'll believe the rolling shutter artifacts are virtually gone now, due to nikon's reported improved processing power and improved compression quality.
i've come to want 25fps more than 24, i really don't notice the difference.
had them transferred various ways and looked at them on the big screen at the joint.... beautiful.
nikon knows this, and has acted in such a way to present an attractive product.
the nikon d300s features 24p video at 1280x720, with an external microphone input.
for a pro on a budget.. - a camera with such an incredible range of interchangeable lenses - it is a good compromise for the time being.
i'm also curious about the comments on low light from the gh1, but that 5 min cap on recording in the d300s puts the nail in the coffin.
oh, and 1080p would be nice too, but not mandatory....august 1, 2009 | dan this just in: no manual control, fuhggedaboutit.
it seems a gh1 is most viable for me as it is 25/50p and manual.
the footage transferred realtime from the camera and card looked the best of all the tests we did....
i'm looking forward to a full frame 1080p, 24p, manual control, high quality codec, & 0 rolling shutter artifacts.
i think nikon can easily do this if they decide it's a priority.
beautiful art can be with with 10 x 10 pixel 2-bit color.
taugust 1, 2009 | tarek kandil the videos looks fine, but they don't tell us much about the features.
i eagerly await news of nikon, they're saying a d700 is comin out in oct, this is all according to dvx.
the real differences in cameras are tool-wise.
i want to call the chief engineer and tell her/him a thing or two.
i think that's a good compromise, especially since we may learn from canon's upcoming 1d that pro-video comes at pro-price.
concerning the rolling shutter i wouldn´t expect too much from this camera, it is still using a cmos sensor which is in most cases the reason for this bad effect.
i understand the d90 is less than that......august 6, 2009 | rocket boy so, i am gathering that this camera does not have a full-frame sensor, considering the price?august 8, 2009 | jason t. also,
manual control is the only thing i *really* need.
now, lets hope that there really is a 700x with video.
now that i've been using the 5dmkii, which is my first full frame dslr, i don't think i'll go back to crop.
i was just in vietnam shooting hd water bgs with the 5d for matte shots.... mostly locked off.
you can drag those links to your bookmarks bar so you never forget.
this page hints that it might have some manual exposure control (thanks @tylerginter!).
needables the nikon d300s features 24p video at 1280x720, with an external microphone input.
as the camera does its weird thing, we'd see numbers go up and down, and at least have an idea of what we 'lock' at.
i would make better use of my cam if at least i knew at what iso/shutter combination my cam was doing during live view.
i have a lot of nikon equipment, an i love it for stills, so i really don't want to go canon.
picture quality is very beautiful (i tested it with nikon 50mm and 70-200mm 2.8 pro lenses and it is really-really sharp, and it is amazing that you can use 2.8 and get beautiful blurred background in video)
i'd say the smaller sensor, the low light sensitivity and the general lack of "beauty" in the image qualify too.
well, there is also that 5 minute recording limit.
no motion artifacts, very low system requirements.
no iso, keep my full manual lenses, and speed up to 25 fps when i need to go to dvd.
nikon also clearly learned from canon in that they got the camera into some pro shooters’ hands before its release: rolling shutter is either greatly improved from the d90 or it’s being expertly hidden in editing.
like a built-in meter works i would think.
we shot a feature on the d90 and the time we spent trying to get the right exposure was a major drag, while we knew how to control jello and had learned from extensive testing exactly what and what not to expect from the codec, which we had decided was "good enough".
threre are enough people who know about it to affect their purchase.
this is according to a nikon product specialist in sweden.
august 1, 2009 | eugenia i would be ok with manual shutter only, fine with auto iso, currently use a d90 and controlling one stray variable would be a bit easier than two, lwt alone the initial three.
from the videos it looks like it at least has the ability to lock the exposure settings which is better than nothing.
your thoughts?august 1, 2009 | tarek kandil i'd say the rolling shutter affects are not present simply due to either editing or avoiding offensive shots all together.
if the timelapse shots are done using nikon stills, then dammit that doesn't count.
you can pre-order the d300s now from amazon.
august 2, 2009 | vade on thing i've got to hand to nikon is that they have less of a videolook than what i've seen from 5d mkii.
if you move the camera fast then yes, there is that weird effect on top but much-much better than on the d90 footage, hardly noticable.
i just bought my d90 and already its out of date.
that said, however, you can clearly see the rolling shutter affects in the helo blades at the beginning of clip 2.
the d300s will auto-focus on a fixed point in the frame.
cinematic black-and-white and lighting control for your iphone and ipad.
and the d700's af system is much more advanced than the 5d's.
i've awful footage from imax camera (not to mention every dslr including the 5d mkii) and beautiful pixel vision stuff.
i like mjpeg, it's the low bitrate that sucks.
my guess is that the camera is peeling the image off the sensor in about 1/1000s which would be hardly visible in most cases.
the cars were probably trudging along slowly.
for now, i still think it's not high on their priority list to really improve anything video related, especially if they dropped the ball on manual control.
i'd also love to hear more about the gh1 from you stu.
for some reason especially the highligts on the mii looks very digital and video'ish to me.
if you can't let us control it directly, at least tell us what the cam is doing.
(it looks better on 35mm than on an hd screen btw) ;-)august 1, 2009 | mattias i love motion jpeg too, it already has a natural filmic look to it without that harsh video feel and the still frames extracted from the video are cleaner to.
nikon also clearly learned from canon in that they got the camera into some pro shooters’ hands before its release: rolling shutter is either greatly improved from the d90 or it’s being expertly hidden in editing.
august 1, 2009 | tarek kandil also, watching the india-fest video, pausing at the cars 'whizzing' by, i didn't realize they were played back so fast.
reading up on dvxuser and not many ppl look happy so far.
nikon after all make 24p as yet.
we await kholi to pick one up, but i think even he changed his mind.
i also believe the rolling shutter artifacts were hidden, using tricks.
this whole ninjaclaw backrub thing is extremely frustrating.
rambo you'd think that after the big fuss with the 5dii and manual control that if the 300s had manual controls, it wouldn't be a secret, but rather they would shout it from the rooftops.
it also features limited autofocus in video mode.
what a tool for doing elements for matte paintings....
cinematic looks for your iphone and ipad movies.
but with this, you turn on live view, shake the cam around till you get the numbers you like, and lock.
nikon would begin to be interesting for me --only when they stop using the very lame motion jpeg codec!
i am no programmer (this is not modesty i really am guessing and know very, very little about hardware/firmware)
you're kidding of course or never read the rebel guide or confused a camera with the person aiming it and the person viewing it.
it is neccessary for some applications and for special circular fish eye lenses with lots of black.
sorry about the typo, using ipod touch to type.
it is much better to watch a nice edited, picture rich film than just some sample footage.
i just got my d300s recently, i knew and i expected no manual shutter speed control in video mode, however i was quite happy to notice that it does have an exposure locking in video mode - i can confirm that - but you need to set the ae-l button to "lock" mode in system settings so that you need to push it only once and after you do not have to hold it.
another bad habit of this little cameras is their sensitivity for little vibrating wobbles, which can be reduced by adding weight.
if you do have pro lenses then you will have amazing image quality and let's not forget that interchangeable lenses are available only on "real" video cameras at a much-much-much higher prices..
regarding the video bit rate: from the nikon d300s microsite, 5 minutes of 720p video (& sound) from the d300s produces a file size of 800mb, which (if my calculations are correct) is approximately 21mbps.
c. thinking of this, and considering the price bracket that's not very 'pro' i would really be happy with just shutter controls on my d90 as it is.
it will be most noticeable in fast horizontal pans, or fast (zoomed in) handheld without stabilizing techniques and vertical lines in the picture like trees or buildings.
$1,800, body-only.33 comments | email this | pimp this i'd say that there are at least shutter speed manual controls hiding from the videos.
march 12, 2010 | chris i own a d300s and i have to say im very sad about its video feature, i have been plagued with lines that seem to go up or down, besides the rollig shutter deffect and the difficult focus and exposure controls makes this camera a bad investment.
the easiest way to support prolost is to begin your amazon, itunes, mac app store, zacuto or b&h shopping here.
i still think the gh1 is a way better value considering it has a flip-out lcd, full manual control, autofocus, shoots in 720p and 1080p, and has three different filmspeeds (24, 30, & 60fps) - all for $1500 with a pretty decent lens.
so that is how you get your manual setting in video mode at this time.. a bit limited but if you are creative it is going to work.
i'm pretty happy for now but there are areas canon can't improve on that nikon does.
