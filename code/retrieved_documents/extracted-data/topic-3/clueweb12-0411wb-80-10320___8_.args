the competition between canon and nikon in dslr bodies is important for both companies, as they each are pressing the other towards better digital slr cameras, more so than any other company or factor.personally, most amateur users would be better served by buying a d70s (or digital rebel) and using the money saved to buy another lens or a better tripod.it has a nice feel, takes nice pictures, has plenty of nice features, and really is everything a non-pro needs in a camera.continuous motor drive and the self timer are available via a separate button on the top plate, which is simpler than on most nikon bodies, which often require a two-step process, but bracketing, image quality, image size, and a few other functions are only accessible through the menu system on the 20d. fortunately, the menu system has been streamlined a bit from previous models and is easy to learn and use.it's a fine camera that does what 90% of the market needs done.in traditional canon consumer fashion, the 20d is a light, smallish body (certainly when compared to the 1d and 1ds), and a bit oriented towards all-automatic shooting.color is good and well saturated, contrast is excellent in the mid-range of the tonal ramps, and overall detail is very good.canon is now producing a series of ef-s lenses to help with the reduced angle of view, but true wide angle aficionados will find themselves taking a hard look at third-party solutions such as sigma's 12-24mm or 10-20mm.the new 10-22mm canon ef-s lens isn't what i'd call distinguished in ability, but finally gets canon into the right focal length range for serious wide angle work.the 20d is near or at state-of-the-art in autofocus performance for a consumer dslr.moreover, anyone shooting action in low light with the 20d really needs to understand the physical orientations of the outlying sensors; some are vertical, some are horizontal, and those differences can indeed influence focus speed and accuracy in some framings with some subjects.even though the right grip extension is quite pronounced, it fits a small hand well, and the slight contouring makes it easy to hold the camera with one hand (battery life is excellent, as good as any consumer dslr to date.repeated focusing on the same object can produce slightly different results, with ever-so-slight misses in front of or behind the actual point with no predictability.the raw dcrs give you even more ability to pull high quality images out of this camera.
