photography: think simpler without comments i’m a photographer that values both functionality and beauty.
even the back of this little wallet has a slot too.
if you’re a photographer that likes to keep his/her gear very minimal; then this is a wallet for you.

in terms of texture, it feels unlike any other leather i’ve touched.
