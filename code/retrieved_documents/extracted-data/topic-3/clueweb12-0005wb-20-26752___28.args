case in point, is the new gallery i have set up here at the blog, titled tabletop photography.
yup, i talk about 3 different types of cards that make for cool holiday gifts this year for the photographer you know.
well, i was going to save the podcast for tuesday, but decided since some of the information was from this week that i had better put it out before it gets “old”, so a new podcast is available for your listening pleasure.
i also tackle a few listener questions, and offer up a photo road tip for the listening audience.
you can get apple-specific details on their main page.
it doesn’t even have to be a canon camera, listen to your camera whether it’s canon nikon, olympus, sony, pentax, panasonic, leica, hasselblad, etc! find out why in the podcast up now over at personal life media  the rest of the show notes, including additional links referenced in the show are over at the blog.
tune in to get the low-down on everything from pocketwizards to cybersyncs, skyports and more.more.
a couple blog announcements, some links to contest info and other stuff is all available from the blog's show notes, so be sure to stop over there to get the skinny on things like photo walks, contest info, and blog news.
some other web links i learned about recently also include fotoblur.com and usefilim.com  both are much more cognizant and respective of photography copyright than other social and photo networking sites like flickr and facebook
we had a great chat that you definitely are going to want to tune in to to get some tips tricks and places to go for great photography.
of course the show always takes care of a couple listener questions and answers, so it’s 45 jam-packed minutes of photography fun.
last but not least, the podcast that i had intended to put out last week was delayed for a few days as i put the finishing touches up on a home improvement project.
for those of us with aspirations of sharing our work with others via art shows, galleries, contests and competitions, the value of the artist statement can make the difference between getting into a show, gallery or other event and buying a ticket.
you’ll want to listen when you really can dedicate the 25 minutes as it’s a pretty rapid fire show this week.
of course, the staple news and q&a are back as always, and this week we did something extra special where we streamed the show live across ustream!
this week we expand on another blog post and take a look at the details of why lenses are a better investment than lenses.
listen in to the podcast right here at personal life for the answers and full details on all the show segments.
on this week's show, rich charpentier is back and we're talking about all the latest news, including the new apple ipad, taking listener questions, and talking again about more printing and photography questions.
a couple of show notes: the 1st segment is a more detailed look from yesterdays post on the cost of doing business, and talks about the details involved in creating a business plan.
also on this weeks show, i had the opportunity to talk with matthew bamberg, a well-known and respected photographer and author of digital photography books.
remember to digg the podcast page too - more listeners means more questions and answers, and more fodder for podcasts!
we'll look at planning and packing for travel, security concerns, and how to scout before you leave.
that means you’re actually gonna have to spend time with family, friends, and loved ones for a few days.
there's photo news, and q&a as always, so be sure to stop over to the blog and get the show notes for this last episode of 2009!
