though their meter readings were very slightly off in aperture priority, it should be noted that in general, canon and nikon do have slightly different metering algorithms and this is just part of how they work.nikon’s front filter thread is just a bit larger than canon’s and the overall feel of the lens is a bit less plasticy.most of new york city is covered in buildings, and therefore needed to shoot at iso 800 because of the diffused shadow lighting around the area.but the nikon seems to be much sharper — looks like the canon is not properly focused or needs a micro-focus adjustment).the new nikon 85mm f1.8 is far newer than the canon version: which actually dates back to the film days.being a canon 5d mk ii and 85mm f1.8 usm owner, i decided to put the two lenses in a non-scientific and totally practical test using all available light at around 7pm in nyc and only shooting at f4 and wider for a portrait.the canon images may be darker and therefore also have a perceived better sharpness, but it’s not really true.the images were then brought into lightroom 4 beta and had the clarity and sharpness adjusted the exact same amount for each image.both lenses focus extremely fast, though in real life practice i felt that canon’s 85mm f1.8 is still the current champ.the canon pics have more sky in the background, for this reason the comparison is difficult and not fair.a known problem with it though is the color fringing wide open; but this is also a problem that plague’s nikon’s optics as shown in theprevious test.engels-foto the canon pics have  more sky in the background, for this reason the comparison is difficult and not fair.the light sky works like back light and affects themselves naturally negatively.but in this test, i let the cameras do all the work at aperture priority to simulate their metering methods in real life as well.the canon ones are pretty alright on their own, but seen alongside the nikon, they just look way harsher.
