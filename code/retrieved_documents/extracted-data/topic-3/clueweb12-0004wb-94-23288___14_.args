this kind of sensitivity provides the ability to capture an image when another camera would simply record soot and shadow, or be forced to use a shutter speed so low as to render an unusable image.but with some one million unique readers a month this site needs to reflect from time to time the interests of a broader constituency, and in this case i felt that my lack of nikon coverage was doing a disservice to that segment of the community, especially pros for whom nikon is their tool of choice.a higher megapixel full frame chip is absolutely inevitable, and the d300's noise characteristics may give us a hint at what to expect from a higher resolution d3 sensor.if you're a nikon user, or thinking of becoming one and don't have the budget for a d3, the d300 is an extremely capable camera, as will be seen in my forthcoming review.but now with the d3 nikon has upped the ante, producing a camera that appears to offer lower noise than canon (at least against the flagship 1ds mkiii), and higher available speeds as well.nothing terribly formal, but enough tests, with enough pairs of experienced eyes, both canon and nikon users, to come to some preliminary conclusions.both cameras produced iso 1600 images of astonishing quality.the speeds of iso 6400, 12,800 and 25,600 are also possible on the nikon d3, but not on the canon, so there's no comparison to be made at these levels.the 1d mkiii's sensor at 10mp is closer to the d3's 12mp than the 1ds mkiii's 21mp, and the pixels of the nikon are bigger, so theoretically of lower noise.i see comparable resolving power and clarity (not absolute resolution, of course), and at least a one stop noise advantage to the new nikon.this site is designed to reflect my personal interests in photography, both the art and the craft.aperture was set to f/6.3 and the shots were taken in aperture priority mode at iso 1600.the lighting in my gallery is designed to illuminate framed photographs, not for shooting portraits.noise is more apparent, and though the exposure was 1/50th second vs the d3's 1/60th second (essentially identical), the image was overall quite a bit darker, indicating that the iso was likely not what the camera indicated it was; maybe iso 1000 in reality, and the apparent dynamic range somewhat less as well.compare the nikon d3 and the canon 1ds mkiii, especially at high iso, since the buzz about the new nikon is its claimed very low noise capability at high iso ( up to iso 25,600).
