both 5d mk iii & d800 are fantastic cameras, they both excel at some features and lack at others – thus providing specific needs of specific market segments.i have invested “a coin or two” in canon glass, but that is no issue at all – i’m going to sell them all with basically no loss and buy equivalent nikon alternatives.i really like the sound of the pixel based metering of d800, time-lapse support, higher pixel count, built-in flash (for fill) water-resistance, and potential to use an f4 lens with 2x and still get af.the 14-24mm lens and 24-120 cover most options for me as a photo-journalist.both cameras appear to be fantastic and we are all winners.absolutely no doubts 5dmk3 will take amazing pictures, just the same applies to d800 (maybe save for iso12800 which might be better on canon due to pixel size but that doesn’t bother me at all as i rarely see iso1600).nonetheless, both cameras are excellent.we thought about throwing in the canon eos-1d x and the nikon d4, but those are approximately $3,000 more so they’re in a different class.music by dog's eye view, song ”everything falls apart” shot on the… this quick video shows a canon rep demonstrating the fluid action of the internal nd filters of the canon c300… b&h is now taking preorders for the new rokinon-branded samyang 24mm f/1.4 all-manual lens.i’m absolutely convinced in both, just d800 fits better for me and seems to be better value for the money.mar, 2012 by planetmitch in 5d mk ii, 5d3, d800 one of the first things people start doing when a new camera like the canon eos 5d mark iii is announced is compare it to other cameras in its class… so we knew you’d want thatlove the low light options, speed that it offers.yes when you compare some cameras maybe you want to give an extra 5 to 10 minutes to get the specs from the manufacturer.like or dislike: 1  3 reply to this comment d800 also has in-camera hdr, ae lock and a self cleaning sensor.a few more - autofocus points: 51 points, 9 at f/8 - video recording format: h.264/mpeg-4 avc - battery grip: mb-d12 optional - battery: en-el15 other factors that could be included is the: - price - wb bracketing - connectivity, i.e. usb and any thing else that could be added.
