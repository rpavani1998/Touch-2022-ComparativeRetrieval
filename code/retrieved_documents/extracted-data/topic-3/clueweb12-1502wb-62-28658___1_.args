in spite of their megapixel differences, both cameras have image sensors that deliver stunning resolution.the canon has high sensitivity (iso 12800 – ideal for low light situations where you don't want to use flash) and offers speeds of up to 6400.both have the ability to record outstanding high definition (hd) movies or videos.it also has a then "new" metering system with a 63-zone dual-layer system that gives the user focus and color information to ensure accurate exposure of pictures even when the lighting is difficult or bad.their lcd (liquid crystal display) screens are also the same size – 3 inches – and both offer 100% viewfinder accuracy and 920,000 dots.however, even some ardent nikon enthusiasts will admit that thecanon 7d has the edge, with its 18 megapixel cmos sensor that offers superb resolution.like most other dslrs of this era, the screen is interactive and so most of the shoot settings can be changed really quickly.this camera has a non-latched memory card opening that was launched with the d700, but with both cf and sd slots which offers amazing flexibility.it boasts some of the best features of previous digital nikon cameras, including the virtual horizon from the d3, movies that were made possible by the d90, and the "quiet" drive mode launched on the d5000.it offers 1.0x magnification and 100% coverage which its predecessor, the eos 50d didn't offer (that model has only 0.95x magnification and 95% coverage).what the canon 7d has to offer the canon eos 7d's 18 mp sensor (which canon calls its "intelligent view finder" ) is one of the best things about it, largely due to the new technology it represents.what the canon 7d has to offer the canon eos 7d's 18 mp sensor  (which canon calls its "intelligent view finder" ) is one of the best things about it, largely due to the new technology it represents.launched in 2009, several months after thenikon d300s, canon's 7d introduced a new, improved auto-focus system that has a dedicated dual digic 4 processor as well as a different shutter mechanism that enables an unbelievably good 8 fps (frames per second) burst mode.in fact the high definition video feature is one of this camera's major selling points.with the canon you can shoot 18 mp 14-bit images as 8 fps as standard, in a burst of up to 126 large jpegs.
