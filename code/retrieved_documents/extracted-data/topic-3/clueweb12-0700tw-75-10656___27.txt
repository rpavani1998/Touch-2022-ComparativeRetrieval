canon specs the body weight at 30.3 ounces (860g) body only.
the superior resolution of the sony a77 is lost a bit to noise suppression in the smaller sensor, particularly noticeable in the shadows and the dark mosaic background.
canon 5d mark iii versus nikon d3x at iso 100 canon  5d mark iii at iso 100 nikon d3x at iso 100 nikon's 24 megapixel d3x turns the previous assessment on its head a bit,  as the d3x probably picks up a bit more detail than the 5d mark iii.
the canon 5d mark iii's image is quite smooth, though, offering very similar levels of detail.
the 5d mark iii uses a new bg-e11 battery grip, which includes a duplicate  multi-controller for portrait shooting.
still, they're pretty close.
canon expects to ship the 5d mark iii in the us market from the end of march 2012.

canon eos 5d mark iii hands-on preview by shawn barnett, mike tomkins, and zig weidelich posted: 03/02/2012 though canon makes many excellent digital slr cameras for pros and  consumers, none has reached the superstar status of the canon 5d series.
18 to 22 megapixels isn't that large a difference, but it's clear that the 5d mark iii is able to resolve a little more detail.
the exception is the red leaf swatch, which while somewhat cartoonish in the 5d mark ii's rendering, is softer from the 5d mark iii.
the gp-e2 gps receiver costs around us$390.
two minor elements are moved on the front of the canon 5d mark iii: the  infrared port is now on the grip (where you'll find it on most every other  canon digital slr with the feature), and the depth-of-field preview button has  moved to the grip-side of the body.

sensitivity ordinarily ranges from iso 100 to 25,600 equivalents, and can be expanded to encompass iso 50 to 102,400 equivalents.
the speedlite 600ex-rt allows not only the line-of-sight optical wireless  functionality of existing units, but also a new two-way radio connectivity,  with 30 meters / 98.4 feet range.
canon 5d mark iii versus canon 7d at iso 3,200 canon 5d mark iii at iso 3,200 canon 7d at iso 3,200 as if to underscore the advantage of full frame and canon's recent  advancement, the canon 7d's iso 3,200 images are even fuzzier, seen as if  through frosted glass by comparison.
the 5d mark iii retains more fabric  texture in the pink swatch at this iso setting, though.
of all the additional features, probably the most important is the new autofocus system, brought over from the 1d x, which in addition to having more points (61) and more cross-type points (41), covers considerably more of the canon 5d iii's image area, while the af system of the past two models were brought over from the company's aps-c cameras, thus covering much less image area in the viewfinder.
on the top deck, you can now assign the multi-function button to instantly  switch between raw and jpeg shooting with a single press.
the  exception is the red leaf swatch, which while somewhat cartoonish in the 5d  mark ii's rendering, is softer from the 5d mark iii.
this will be particularly useful to fans of hdr photography, and if you don't want to deal with processing hdr images yourself, there's also an in-camera three-shot hdr mode, a first for an eos model.
15 radio channels are available (plus auto), and up to 15  speedlite flashes can be used on a channel, in as many as five groups, with  each group separately able to be set to e-ttl or controlled manually.
this refers to a built-in  database that allows automatic correction of both spherical and chromatic  aberration, astigmatism, curvature of field, diffraction, and low-pass filter  effects.
there's also a dual-axis level display, similar to that of the eos 7d. in playback mode, you can now process raw images in-camera, and take  advantage of the lens correction functions when doing so.
a 4-digit  wireless radio id can be assigned to separate radio networks.
thanks to its full-frame sensor, there's no focal length crop.
though we  normally start with iso 1,600 here, we thought we'd start with the base iso to  show the best each camera can do.
battery life is rated to cipa testing standards at 950 shots with the viewfinder, or 200 shots in live view mode, at 73°f / 23°c.
the canon 5d mark iii's image is quite smooth,  though, offering very similar levels of detail.

today's iso 3,200 is yesterday's iso 1,600 (well, almost), so below are the same crops at iso 3,200.
finally, the new speedlite 600ex-rt costs us$630 or thereabouts, and the  new st-e3-rt transmitter is priced at approximately us$470.
although the target market is clearly experienced photographers, the 5d mark iii caters to the occasional time when you want to lend your camera to a less-experienced photographer, perhaps to get in the shot yourself.
thanks to its full-frame sensor, there's  no focal length crop.
for video mode, the  upper limit is capped at iso 25,600 equivalent.
interestingly, as well as using the secondary card as an overflow or duplicate, or to segregate by file type, you can also record different raw or jpeg types to each card.
the 5d mark iii also offers up a multiple exposure function.
(you can also adjust  iso sensitivity, shutter speed, and aperture as the video is captured.)
the eos 5d mark iii's body includes weather-sealing to a level said to be  better than that of the 5d mark ii, but not to the same degree as an eos  1-series body like the eos-1d x.
dimensions are 6.0 x 4.6 x 3.0 inches (152.0 x 116.4 x 76.4mm).
the top deck includes a mode dial with the auto+ mode, combined from the creative auto and green zone modes on the 5d mark ii.
of course, there's still a monochrome status display on the top deck, as well.

just like the 1d x, you can combine up to nine frames into a single exposure in-camera.
these images are best quality jpegs straight out of  the camera, at default settings including noise reduction.
dual card slots mean that the 5d mark iii can now record to either udma 7 compactflash or secure digital cards, including sdhc and sdxc.

while the 5d mark iii has slightly better detail in higher contrast subjects, the d4 renders the troublesome red swatch as if it were no problem at all.
the 5d mark iii uses a new bg-e11 battery grip, which includes a duplicate multi-controller for portrait shooting.
as well as the previously-mentioned microphone and headphone jacks, the 5d  mark iii also offers up a pc sync terminal, combined standard-def av output /  usb 2.0 high speed port, wired remote control port, and high-def hdmi video  output.
we shot some videos to illustrate the canon 5d mark iii's various new features, as well as a video of how the canon 600ex rt's radio flash works with the 5d mark iii.
the shutter mechanism is rated as good for 150,000 shots, unchanged from  the 5d mark ii.
of the latter, five will work as high-precision points to f/2.8.
the 5d mark iii renders the pink swatch a  little more magenta than it should.
remote camera triggering is possible from a flash strobe.
the mode dial has a central locking button, as seen on the 60d. (this was  also available as an option on the 7d and 5d mark ii, but here it's the  default.)
the 5d mark ii's images  look downright hazy by comparison.
the 600ex-rt has a guide number of 60 meters / 197 feet at maximum zoom, and has a zoom range of 20 to 200mm.

the 5d mark iii's 63-zone dual-layer ifcl metering sensor was first seen in the eos 7d.
nikon's 16.2-megapixel d4 took a different approach to full-frame, preferring low res for better low-light performance and higher frame rate in their pro press camera, and it clearly pays off here.
also, because the 5d  mark iii is a beta unit, keep in mind image quality may not be representative  of final production models.
there's a new wft-e7a wireless file transmitter that also supports the eos  7d and 60d, and includes 802.11a/b/g/n wi-fi and gigabit ethernet.
this full-color metering allows better subject detection, information which is also fed back to the autofocus system to further aid subject tracking.
