the camera uses a vcm (voice coil motor) for high-speed, quiet, energy-efficient lens movement with precise control.canon features ud glass, double-sided aspherical glass-molded and ultra-high-refraction-index glass lens elements to effectively suppress chromatic aberration while maintaining a remarkably compact size.the canon sx40 hs features advanced multi-area white balance optimizing color tones of both subject and background under multiple light sources.similarly as canon, fuji features high optical performance glass lens elements (aspherical, high refractive index, and ed glass lenses) make the exceptional brightness of f2.8 at wide angle and f5.6 at telephoto possible.but we should not forget about canon sx 40 hs sensor and image processor, canon sx 40 hs uses newly developed bsi cmos sensor and digic 5 image processor, the digic 5 image processor creates 75% less noise and 6x faster compared to digic 4 image processor, due to new sensor and image processor you get more details and less noise in high iso settings.but we should not forget about canon sx 40 hs sensor and image processor, canon sx 40 hs uses newly developed bsi cmos sensor and digic 5 image processor, the digic 5 image processor creates 75% less noise and 6x faster compared to digic 4 image processor,  due to new sensor and image processor you get more details and less noise in high iso settings.multi-area white balance in sx 40 hs: the canon sx40 hs features advanced multi-area white balance optimizing color tones of both subject and background under multiple light sources.the new sensor of fuji x s1 allows you capture 3 exposures of the same scenewith high-speed continuous shooting, each at a different dynamic range setting (100%, 200% and 400%).images captured with image sensor shift vibration reduction enabled are further processed with electronic vr for images that are sharper and exhibit less blur.canon sx 40hs features 6 is modes and optical is the new hybrid system of canon sx 40 hs features six  intelligent is modes, canon sx 40 hs automatically chooses from six different modes (normal, macro, panning, dynamic, powered, tripod) to optimize image stabilization and help achieve crisp, blur-free images for various shooting conditions nikon features image sensor shift(not optical) + electronic vibration reduction (vr) function.canon sx 40hs features 6 is modes and optical is the new hybrid system of canon sx 40 hs features six intelligent is modes, canon sx 40 hs automatically chooses from six different modes (normal, macro, panning, dynamic, powered, tripod) to optimize image stabilization and help achieve crisp, blur-free images for various shooting conditions nikon features image sensor shift(not optical) + electronic vibration reduction (vr) function.image processor: image processor of both canon and fuji are very fast, both can capture 10 shot/sec in high speed shooting mode, nikon p500 is limited to 8 shot/sec only.raw: only fujifilm x s1 features raw format capture, fujifilm x s1 features in camera raw converter, the conversion of raw data not only takes into account exposure compensation, white balance and other in-camera image quality control settings, but also lets the user apply film simulation modes in the converter mode.nikon p500 image sensor captures more noise and less details compared to canon sx 40 hs (see here).nikon p500 features 36x zoom and nikkor ed glass.
