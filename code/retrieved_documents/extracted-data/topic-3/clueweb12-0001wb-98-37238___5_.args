the canon produces excellent images in bothraw and jpeg formats, and it copes very well at high isos, offering users the option to reduce noise to their own set trade-offs against image detail and quality.both cameras have solid and reliable autofocus, although the nikon's speed is reliant on whatever lens you're using, as it has no in-body autofocus motor.the nikon also produces excellent images in both raw and jpeg, and it does an even better job of keeping thenoise down at high isos.autofocus and af points both cameras have solid and reliable autofocus, although the nikon's speed is reliant on whatever lens you're using, as it has no in-body autofocus motor.it also has better dynamic range and color depth than the canon.the t3i is also more prone to chromatic aberration than the d5100.however, image quality is where it counts, so, if you're new to digital cameras, then the nikon has the edge.the canon's hand grip is perhaps marginally easier to use, but both cameras have articulated lcd screens.however, the t3i yet again has canon's trademark problems in coping with artificial light when using auto white balance, as images are distinctly orange.while both cameras produce great images, the d5100 is just a little bit better in most respects.the only place where the canon falls down on controls is in the inexplicable change of functionsÂ of the 4-way controller once the camera is in live view or movie mode.the only place where the canon falls down on controls is in the inexplicable change of functions of the 4-way controller once the camera is in live view or movie mode.canon's t3i has 18mp of resolution compared to nikon's 16.2mp.i personally find the layout and control system of the nikon confusing and somewhat lacking in key areas.best of all, it doesn't seem to share other dslrs' tendencies to overexpose in high contrast situations.
