sampling the image at 36 megapixels opens up new horizons in photography, new creative possibilities, increased realism, the ability to crop, to downsample, etc.based on nikon’s past history (e.g., d3x / d3s), and the sony nex-7 image quality (even smaller photosites), i predict that the 2-3 years of sensor technology improvements are going to produce stunning image quality at iso 100 - 400, along with very good image quality thereafter.resolution based on nikon’s past history (e.g., d3x / d3s), and the sony nex-7 image quality (even smaller photosites), i predict that the 2-3 years of sensor technology improvements are going to produce stunning image quality at iso 100 - 400, along with very good image quality thereafter.setting aside the cost of the d800, it also means that a cropped sensor dx-format camera is pointless for the purposes of getting closer to a distant subject (e.g. wildlife), since the d800 can be cropped down to its dx area for 16mp images.while zooms are much better than they were even 5 years ago, one’s image quality standards have to be rock-bottom to posit that a 28-300 would be a good lens on a 36mp camera.still, the size and weight of the camera mean that it might yet prove to be the first video cameraand that with most lenses, the camera will be so good that only the failure to use a better lens will keep the photographer thinking that the optical quality is good.the 921k pixel screen is claimed to have some improvements in viewing quality, but i was hoping that the 36mp sensor would be matched by a 1.5 or 2+ million pixel lcd.i doubt very much that landscape and similar shots which require whole-frame sharpness will realize the potential of the d800 using most of the nikon lens lineup, at least most of the zoom lineup.i’ll suggest that 100-200 megapixels would be ideal for the sampling frequency of a dslr, which might meanfinished images in the 50-60 megapixel range.for those who must have ultra low-light capability, the nikon d800e + nikon d4 seem to me to be a tantalizing combination.i predict that most nikon zooms and some primes will not be up to snuff over the whole frame, but will provide very acceptable results in the central 1/2 to 2/3 area, which is where portraits and similar shots need the sharpness.lenses i predict that most nikon zooms and some primes will not be up to snuff over the whole frame, but will provide very acceptable results in the central 1/2 to 2/3 area, which is where portraits and similar shots need the sharpness.the existing virtual horizon feature on the d3x / d3s is not accurate to more than ~1°, so buildings visibly tilt, something i’ve seen over and over with my nikon pro bodies.this is very exciting and useful, given the 36mp resolution.
