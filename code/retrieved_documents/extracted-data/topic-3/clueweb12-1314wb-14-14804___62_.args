any one individual lens may have sluggish diaphragm, indeed a common cause of overexposure in all a-mount lenses is incomplete stop-down.the pixel alignment seems very accurate and shots at settings like iso 3200 show an improvement in detail which would be hard to obtain even by good raw processing.it makes the transition from optical to electronic viewfinders likely for everything except a limited choice of professional optical viewfinder dslrs.evfs will not be unique to sony and it will continue to develop in resolution, colour fidelity and refresh rate.the post-processing method offered by nikon and others, where you can apply similar effects to raw or jpeg files already stored on your memory card and create a new version, is preferable.the a77 can do that sort of wrong stuff if left on wide area focus – but it doesn’t light up the wrong af points in the finder to fool you, and it does not require programming of af preferences to avoid proximity or response speed errors (both canon and nikon pro models can disappoint if used ‘out of the box’, and need their defaults changing depending on your typical photo situations).if anything the glass thickness and distinct double air to glass surfaces of a rear mounted filter make it far more likely to degrade an image than the slt.the a77 eyepiece glass is much closer to the eye than the a55 or previous slr models, and the upper positioned eye-sensor turns the finder on and off with precision saving power but causing no delays.the most important change for professional and enthusiast owners is the long-overdue addition of a menu item which prevents the evf or lcd live view from showing actual exposure when manual aperture and shutter are set.the viewfinder is a pleasure to use, though evfs differ from optical screens in one important respect, that the eye can not compensate for small errors in the dioptre setting.the colour is also very consistent indeed across the iso range and the feathers in the mask retain the expected detail up to iso 3200.it also makes the a77 finder view an almost perfect match for nikon’s full frame dslrs, which have a slightly smaller apparent screen size than the a900.the hinge design makes a vertical grip possible and also allows a wider range of tripods or quickmount plates.if you choose your start position well (including the brightest highlight area of importance) exposure is very reliable, and at low iso with fine quality, the jpeg is of a professional standard.the camera needs an option to disable auto gain so that a preamp or mic with db cut choices can be used to control a fixed sound level; better would be three levels, like nikon; even better still a proper sound level monitor display and full control in fine steps like canon.
