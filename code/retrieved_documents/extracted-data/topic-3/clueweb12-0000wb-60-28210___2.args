i keep thinking video might be useful for me.
still, the size and weight of the camera mean that it might yet prove to be the first video camera i really use.
which suggests to me that with even halfway decent lighting and the very best lenses, we might be in for a jaw-dropping camera.
this is very exciting and useful, given the 36mp resolution.
but even it it were close to the d3x on a per-pixel basis, having 50% more pixels is an intriguing tradeoff for some shooting.
no doubt the d800 / d800e will have some disappointments and limitations, but it looks about as appealing to me as any nikon dslr yet.
the 921k pixel screen is claimed to have some improvements in viewing quality, but i was hoping that the 36mp sensor would be matched by a 1.5 or 2+ million pixel lcd.
let the megapixel haters stew in their own mental vomit.
while zooms are much better than they were even 5 years ago, one’s image quality standards have to be rock-bottom to posit that a 28-300 would be a good lens on a 36mp camera.
the existing virtual horizon feature on the d3x / d3s is not accurate to more than ~1°, so buildings visibly tilt, something i’ve seen over and over with my nikon pro bodies.
i’ll suggest that 100-200 megapixels would be ideal for the sampling frequency of a dslr, which might meanfinished images in the 50-60 megapixel range.
well, 2+ years of sensor technology development has to count for something.
lenses i predict that most nikon zooms and some primes will not be up to snuff over the whole frame, but will provide very acceptable results in the central 1/2 to 2/3 area, which is where portraits and similar shots need the sharpness.
i predict that failure to match the d800 resolution will grow nikon’s market share substantially.
i am buying the d800e, getting a loaner d800.
the d800 / d800e will even flush out the few weaker offerings in thezeiss lineup.
friday, february 10, 2012 my thoughts on d800/d800e features b&h photo has the nikon d800 and d800e available for pre-order .
for those who must have ultra low-light capability, the nikon d800e + nikon d4 seem to me to be a tantalizing combination.
setting aside the cost of the d800, it also means that a cropped sensor dx-format camera is pointless for the purposes of getting closer to a distant subject (e.g. wildlife), since the d800 can be cropped down to its dx area for 16mp images.
i do hope that nikon has fixed the white-out bug in the d3x and the bang-bang mirror slap problem and has implemented canon-style “mode 2” exposure, and also has not gone and introduced some fundamental flaw.
and a big deal: superior quality including the option to rescue an image or use a wide-gamut spacewhen srgb or adobergb would flatten the color response (increasingly common).
autofocus accuracy i don’t believe in the tooth fairy or santa claus.
“but i only want 18mp jpegs in srgb” easy: shoot in raw, batch process to beautiful artifact-free 18mp jpegs with proper white balance and sharpening and low compression, then toss the raw files.
usb 3.0 useless for mac users as yet.
sampling the image at 36 megapixels opens up new horizons in photography, new creative possibilities, increased realism, the ability to crop, to downsample, etc.

the existing virtual horizon feature on the d3x / d3s is not accurate to more than ~1°, so buildings visibly tilt, something i’ve seen over and over with my nikon pro bodies.
and that with most lenses, the camera will be so good that only the failure to use a better lens will keep the photographer thinking that the optical quality is good.
based on nikon’s past history (e.g., d3x / d3s), and the sony nex-7 image quality (even smaller photosites), i predict that the 2-3 years of sensor technology improvements are going to produce stunning image quality at iso 100 - 400, along with very good image quality thereafter.
i thought were were finally done with the dual card slots taking incompatible cards.
but even it it were close to the d3x on a per-pixel basis, having 50% more pixels is an intriguing tradeoff for some shooting.

note that by going nikon, one can buy zeiss zf.2 lenses, and these can also be used on canon with an adapter.
this is very exciting and useful, given the 36mp resolution.
overall nikon appears to have produced a home run, especially since canon has nothing near it (yet).
long exposures being able to set an exposure longer than 30 seconds without resorting to a programmable remote release.

like clockwork, nikon claims improved metering once again.

of course i would use my zeiss lenses, because nikon af lenses for manual focus are an exercise in frustration.

i hope that the ambient light sensor for the lcd does not go haywire when using afocusing loupe.
too bad the d800 cannot shoot 4k video.

but now if you also carry a nikon d4, that high speed xqd card is useless in a d800/d800e, leading to one more planning complication for those of us carrying a system with both cameras.

thus the d800 represents a best of all worlds scenario.

i doubt very much that landscape and similar shots which require whole-frame sharpness will realize the potential of the d800 using most of the nikon lens lineup, at least most of the zoom lineup.
the 921k pixel screen is claimed to have some improvements in viewing quality, but i was hoping that the 36mp sensor would be matched by a 1.5 or 2+ million pixel lcd.

lcd display i am disappointed here.
