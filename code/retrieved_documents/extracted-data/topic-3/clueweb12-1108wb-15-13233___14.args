that said, nikon has tuned the d3s’s contrast detection system to provide focusing support during movie capture and live view shooting.
combined with slight underexposure, the colours seemed more ‘conservative’ than those captured by the 1d mark iv.
having tested both cameras extensively, we have to call this fight a dead heat.
the fact that both cameras were able to deliver this quality of image when shooting at 9 frames per second or more is simply astonishing.
however, images with both cameras shot at iso 12800 were impressive and very usable.
on the following pages, we’ll look at the key characteristics that make these cameras stand out, and then compare them head-to-head.
if you’ve read our nikon d3s and canon eos 1d mark iv reviews, you’ll know that both these high-end dslrs have been designed for the same purpose – high-speed photography.
in these shots we took a spot meter reading from the boxer’s knee.
whennikon revealed the d3s back in october 2009 it wowed the ever-demanding photographic community with astronomically high iso settings.
while it might not boast the impressive pixel count of the mark iv it’s arguably not a camera targeted at the pixel-counting audience, and there are still more than enough pixels to facilitate a tighter crop if needed.
the mark iv performed extremely well too.
both cameras have evolved relatively seamlessly from their predecessors (the d3 and 1d mark iii, respectively), so users already familiar with the canon or nikon layout will feel instantly at home.
combined with slight underexposure, the colours seemed more ‘conservative’ than those captured by the 1d mark iv.
but at the end of the day, in use, both cameras deliver unparalleled user experience and outstanding image quality in the toughest of shooting situations.
as befits such heavy hitters, we tested the cameras in a boxing gym.
stats like this don’t come cheap, but the cameras are also competitive when it comes to price.
both cameras are tough, robust and built with a spec list sure to impress photographers who need accurate high-speed performance they can rely on.
the large pixel pitch and a modified inner structure catapulted nikon to the front of the iso race, with staggeringly impressive low-light performance thanks to an iso range of 200 to 12800.
the d3s boasts a 51-point af system with 15 cross points, and it was fast and effective in our tests.

while not quite as impressive as images from the d3s, the level of detail and definition captured by the 1d mark iv is still pretty amazing.
the d3s shoots at 9 frames per second (fps), unless you’re using a nikkor dx lens – then the camera switches to crop mode, and the frame rate is increased to 11fps.
combine this with the high-spec lenses you would need to maximise performance and you’re looking at a considerable investment.
what distinguishes these cameras from other dslrs is their ability to capture fast-moving action shots and work in low-light situations.
out of the box thecanon eos 1d mark iv delivered more accurate metering and colour rendition than the nikon d3s, but the d3s could easily be customised to compensate for this.

the new pro eos badly needed smarter autofocus.
the canon eos 1d mark iv has a uniquely sized 16.1mp cmos aps-h sensor, which is half way between full frame and aps-c. this gives a crop factor of x1.3, and while some users might be disappointed that the camera isn’t full frame, others – especially sports photographers shooting from the touchline – will find that little bit of extra reach they can get from their telephoto lenses a real bonus nikon has gone for full-frame, offering a 12.1mp fx cmos sensor.
as a result, they’re targeted at professional photographers, especially those who shoot sports, press photos or wildlife.
these subjects can present some of the most challenging and demanding conditions for photographers to work in.
while images taken at this boosted iso setting are incredibly noisy, it will facilitate hand-held shooting in near darkness without the need for a flash.

this could prove a shrewd decision by nikon, which has anticipated the demands of photographers and sought to combine the best of both worlds with impressive speed and guaranteed quality in equal measure.

the good news is that pro technology has a habit of migrating down the ranks, and it probably won’t be long before you see some of these cameras’ staggering features on cameras at the more affordable end of the range.
however, when put next to the d3s it’s clear to see which camera’s packing the punches.
the canon offers a constant 10fps, making it the winner in the speed stakes.

first of all, let’s look at the sensors.

we tested the cameras in a variety of set-ups and modes, from the fully auto 3d colour matrix metering on thenikon d3s and evaluative mode on the canon eos 1d mark iv to the spot metering modes on both cameras.
the d3s’s 51-point af system was fast and responsive in demanding lighting conditions.
it’s fair to say that both cameras are fast enough for most shooting situations, and while it might be superficial they sound and feel awesome too, especially when you fire off a round of shots.
when it comes to speed, both of these cameras are pretty spectacular, especially when usingautofocus in fast-paced continuous shooting situations.
it’s now got 45 af sensors, 39 of which are cross-shaped (horizontal and vertical line detection).
vs canon eos 1d mark iv: autofocus and frame rate fast, accurate focusing combined with a fast frame rate (and generous buffer) is critical for action, press and wildlife photographers, and in this area both cameras performed exceptionally well in our tests, which we carried out under limited indoor light.
the d3s can record standard hd movies at 720p and 24fps, which is impressive, but not compared with the 1d mark iv’s full hd 1080p at 29.97fps.
