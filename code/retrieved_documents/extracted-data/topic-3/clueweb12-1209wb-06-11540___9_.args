like most lenses, when you have a large amount of light pouring directly into the lens, your images are going to come out with less than ideal contrast and they will look washed out.beyond the build quality and great looks, this lens produces excellent results.it’s a very natural focal length and by that i mean it produces a perspective that is close to what the human eye sees.they allow you to zone focus or you can even preset your focus if you can guesstimate your distance from your subject before you bring the camera up to your face.and i’ll say it again, this lens produces images that have an unexplainable uniqueness to them; subjects seem to really pop from the background areas.this will drastically reduce your focus time once you have the camera up to your eye.i feel that this is important when reproducing photographs that depict everyday life.as i said in the last post, chromatic aberration is apparent at the lenses widest apertures but it is not as bad as some of the other lenses i’ve tested (e.g. sigma 85mm f/1.4).carrying this lens and a camera in your hand for an extended period of time can get old very quickly.i think if you can live with occasionally missing a shot or if you want to dedicate time to perfecting your manual focusing technique, then you will be more than happy with thezeiss 35mm f/1.4.i mean it produces a perspective that is close to what the human eye sees.when paired with a crop body, thezeiss 35mm f/1.4 will end up being closer to a 50mm lens which is what i personally prefer to shoot with.canon 5d with zeiss 35mm f/1.4 - shot at iso 100, f/3.2, 1/2000 sec the carl zeiss distagon t* 35mm f/1.4 ze feels great mated to my 5d. a 35mm lens on a full frame body is great for environmental portraits and street photography.the 35mm focal length canon 5d with zeiss 35mm f/1.4 - shot at iso 100, f/3.2, 1/2000 sec the carl zeiss distagon t* 35mm f/1.4 ze feels great mated to my 5d. a 35mm lens on a full frame body is great for environmental portraits and street photography.while thecanon 5d does have a nice big and bright viewfinder, i cannot always tell when i have my subject 100% in focus.
