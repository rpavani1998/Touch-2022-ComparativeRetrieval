canon and nikon are just better at developing and marketing new products.their dslrs are considered by many to offer very good value for money.they are still a fairly strong player in the advanced amateur category at #3 in dslr (albeit a long way behind canon and nikon).they are still a fairly strong player in the advanced > amateur category at #3 in dslr (albeit a long way behind canon and nikon).the new k200d and k20d, just like their predecessors the k100d and k10d both offer features that will cost a lot more to get in any other brand.on nikon, just about every ai lens or later will mount and work, with some limitations in functionality, just like pentax.just like their predecessors the k100d and k10d both offer features that will cost a lot more to get in any other brand.their k-10d is one of the top rated dslrs, and they've just announced a k-20d @ 14mpx - body about $1k. and unlike nikon and canon pentax dslrs are backward compatible with all of pentax's legacy lenses; going all the way back to screw mount (although somewhat grudgingly and with some limitations in functionality - but you can use them).as p&ss get smaller, and lcd screens get bigger, there's simply not enough room for a viewfinder on many of the cameras.they're not as big as nikon or canon but they do offer a decent alternative.actually nikon have only been a major player again in the last couple of years - they almost became marginalised too - the d40/d40x were the start of their clawback, helped by the d200, and now with the d3/d300 they are well and truly back in the game.although there are some limitations with focus and metering, you can attach, and then take a photograph with all old pentax k mount lenses, or with a suitable adapter you can also use thread, 645 and 67 lenses.and unlike nikon and canon pentax dslrs are backward compatible with all > of pentax's legacy lenses; going all the way back to screw mount > (although somewhat grudgingly and with some limitations in functionality > - but you can use them).i can't think of any reason why the quality of pentax film cameras should not have carried over into the digital world.and unlike nikon and canon pentax dslrs are backward compatible with all >> of pentax's legacy lenses; going all the way back to screw mount >> (although somewhat grudgingly and with some limitations in functionality >> - but you can use them).
