this is an accepted method  of describing lcd resolution within the lcd industry, and it is approved by  cipa.
thanks again, i think you are the only to pick up on this!
a printer may use 6 or more dots (from individual color cartridges) to form the image of a single full-color pixel captured by a camera or scanner.
but a standard vga monitor has 640 horizontal x 480 vertical pixels, equaling 307,000 pixels–so how can a monitor have both maximum resolutions (920,000 pixels and 307,000 pixels)?
frankly, i wish nikon would stick to the pixel method of describing lcd monitor resolution, or that all manufacturers would agree to use dots but then describe the actual horizontal and vertical pixel dimensions of the screen (as nikon did by giving the vga tag).
in contrast, the d3's stripe array maps to standard vga resolution (640x480).
if the ultimate proof of nikon's claim is that the resolution of the new lcd is twice that of canon's (and former nikon lcds), then the side-by-side comparison now available on another prominent digital camera review site rather dramatically and convincingly supports nikon.

new lcd for d3/d300 has 640x480x3 (rgb stripe array filter) = 921,600 dots.
a printer may use 6 or more dots  (from individual color cartridges) to form the image of a single full-color  pixel captured by a camera or scanner.
search for us in the internet – use next words .
fortunately, nikon added that vga tag in all of its literature to clarify the meaning of the specification.
our current lcd (d2xs) has 960x240 (delta array filter)
they are dots or subpixels.
either way, it describes a monitor with more pixels than any  found on competitive camera lcds (at least at the time of this posting).
we wait for you at our site.
imageiseverything | september 09, 2007 at 02:18 pm confusing yes - but from what i've seen the d300 display is much better than the competition -
whichever way you look at it the d3 area resolution is 4 times as much as the old 230k qvga lcds.

oh well in 18 months everyone will have this (or at least this quality of a display), so the wait will be short.

unfortunately, many reviewers missed  that and erroneously thought that the lcd had a super-high 920,000-pixel  resolution—which would make it twice as sharp as the 230,000-pixel  monitors on the new canons (remember, it takes 4x as many pixels in a two  dimensional array to equal twice the resolution).
(not 320x240x3) stripe filter array lcd is more expensive but suits display geometrical  data better (character, cg, line).

almost all dsc use delta array lcd because of lower cost.
fortunately, nikon added that vga tag in all of its literature to  clarify the meaning of the specification.
this rgb arrangement has been inherited by their lcd on the d300 and d3.
these map to a standard qvga 320x240 resolution.
see it this way: you cannot map the screen dimensions to 960x240 real pixels.

usually, maximum computer monitor resolution is listed in horizontal and vertical pixels.

b) cipa guideline: number of pixels/dots: this means the number of effective pixels or dots of (picture/lcd) monitor, where the number means the effective pixels or dots of the area excluding all sections that do not contribute to the display of images or characters.

it does not mean that what you get is high definition just a brighter and maybe cleaner example of a typical 320x240 vga display.
there is definately more rgb pods onthe d3 and d300 but not in terms of area resolution which is similar to the 230k display of the canon.

the math is easy: 640 x 480 x 3= @920,000 dots.
to my recollection it hasn't been used in the camera industry to describe lcd monitor resolution until now.
the advantage of stripe over triad rgb is that it let out more backlight allowing the display to look brighter.
