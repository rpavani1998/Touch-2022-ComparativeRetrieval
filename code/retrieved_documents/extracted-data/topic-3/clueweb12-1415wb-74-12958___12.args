nikon’s announcement of this camera is receiving lots of interest by serious photographers.
you would love the image quality but the 3.9 mps may not be enough for wildlife shots.
but, it will cost one heck of a lot more than the 1ds mark iii which is available today.
most consumer grade cameras won’t get close to that number.
after all, i have spent probably as much as the camera is worth just getting to where i am about to shoot.
i want something that works when the light is there before me.
when one travels and when one enters into the real world of nature photography, the affects of weather on equipment is paramount.
only the best glass can be used with these cameras.
i can buy a 1ds mark iii for about $1,500 less than the d3x.
i want a camera that will withstand what i will put it through.
the 5d mark ii offers the photographer a 21.1 megapixel camera with a full-frame sensor and something entirely new, hd movies!
if i did, a hassy would already be in my camera bag.
heavy is something i detest, but heavy means solid and heavy means better photographs.
what is good is that we do have some amazing options today.
besides the cost will come down substantially in the next six months.
at this level, lens diffraction will be a major issue, especially for nature photography where one wants greater depth of field.
like the nikon, it is a professional grade camera.
problem is, the movies i have seen are terrible, with jerky motion.
and yes, a good camera will produce better images, even though the key ingredient is always the photographer and the photographer’s skills.
nikon d3x is a clear winner .
in other words, it’s better than its sibling, but not yet a professional grade camera.
by the way, i purchased the 5d mk ii and it is a great camera.
if interested, contact me at bill@lockharts.comthis entry was posted in equipment/reviews, thoughts along the way.
canon has to make a pro replacement for the 1ds mark iii soon because the 5d mk ii has a better processor, same megapixels, etc.
at 24mp there is nothing out there, other than the sony alpha, that offers this much resolution.
course any new camera will have production issues.
besides the cost will come down substantially in the next six months.
which is superior is splitting hairs and, if you have one, the question of buying the other should be answered by your accountant.
any flaw in a lens will show.
i want a camera that will withstand what i will put it through.
canon says it has improved the weather sealing.
and i am very happy with the 1ds mkiii’s resolution, just not happy with canon quality-control.
the d3x does not offer sensor cleaning.
with outstanding image quality, it is difficult to pass up, particularly if the price for it drops in the next six months, and likely it will when its replacement is announced.
he says that heavy is better.
and yes, more megapixels produce better resolution.
the 5d mark ii offers the photographer a 21.1 megapixel camera with a full-frame sensor and something entirely new, hd movies!
as these high-end cameras become more complex, and quality-control becomes more and more of an issue, professionals will need to demand more from nikon and canon, and stop tolerating poor workmanship and performance.

it has one great advantage over the nikon d3x, and that is sensor cleaning.
in other words, it’s better than its sibling, but not yet a professional grade camera.
at 21.1 megapixels it is a tad shy of the nikon d3x offering, but it has been around for a good while and the images it produces are equal, in my opinon, to the new nikon offering.
i just stumbled upon your blog and wanted to say that i have really enjoyed browsing your blog posts.
when one travels and when one enters into the real world of nature photography, the affects of weather on equipment is paramount.
the scores of the d3x indicate it is the best of the lot.
second, just getting to the spot that one is about to shoot in involves airplanes, safari vehicles, trekking across long distances, dust, and sometimes moving by boat in both fresh and salt water.
he says that heavy is better.
course, the major consideration for me is that i own lots of canon l glass.
full frame and partial frame at higher speeds.
very high resolution and reduced resolution for images per second.
proven image results.
it produces fantastic images.
the only beneficiary of that merry-go-round are camera dealers and used camera buyers.
if i was you i would wait a bit and keep your ear to the ground.
because canon will respond to the nikon d3x challenge with a mega mega megapixel camera.
for those of us who do nature stuff, well, we have to hang our hats on what manufacturers offer to full-time photographers.
all full frame cameras with no multipliers.
i want a camera that will work when i need it to work.
bill makes a telling statement but doesn’t follow through on it.
it has a scratch on the selection wheel, but other than that it is in perfect condition.
so, maybe nikon isn’t too far off in the price.
the first is weather sealing.
weather sealed and built like a small abrams tank.
the equipment must stand up to extreme temperatures, rain, snow, sleet, and heat.
it has a scratch on the selection wheel, but other than that it is in perfect condition.
at first blush, the nikon d3x sounds like the answer, giving the photographer the option of shooting full-frame or a reduced sized shot at higher speeds.
if interested, contact me at bill@lockharts.com this entry was posted in equipment/reviews, thoughts along the way.
but, canon does not rate it as a professional grade camera.
as to the 5d mark ii, we are reading some bad experiences with new owners.
at 21.1 megapixels it is a tad shy of the nikon d3x offering, but it has been around for a good while and the images it produces are equal, in my opinon, to the new nikon offering.
and yes, a good camera will produce better images, even though the key ingredient is always the photographer and the photographer’s skills.
course, i remember buying the 1ds for that four years ago, so perhaps it is not out of line.
all produce images above 21 mp.
it just isn’t built well enough.
i can buy one for about $2,700, which is substantially less than the d3x and the 1ds iii.
but, in terms of image quality, in my opinion, it is as good as the nikon.
but, heavy means the camera can take better photos at lower shutter speeds.
i hate to even think about it, i yearn for a light-weight camera that produces great images.
i hate having to spend hours and hours getting rid of dust spots on my images.
the first is weather sealing.
best regards, billreply bill, i think the camera you want hasn’t been sold yet.
but, heavy means the camera can take better photos at lower shutter speeds.
one can only tell when we compare the detailed shots taken by nikon d3x and canon 5dm2.
best regards, billreply after sending my canon 20d back to canon 5 times; getting a brand new canon 1ds mkii with a bad sensor; and sending my canon 1ds mkiii back to canon for underexposing 2 full stops, i was ready to sell all my canon lenses and move back to nikon.
i hate to even think about it, i yearn for a light-weight camera that produces great images.
like the nikon, it is a professional grade camera.
i can’t up the frames per second by choosing a different format.
what a revolution that will offer the photographer if it does mature.
the second is build quality and durability.
no it does not offer different shooting modes.
and yes, more megapixels produce better resolution.
but, one thing is for sure, i don’t envision that anytime soon i would have the funds to jump into the medium format arena.
that capability would simply change everything we do with a camera and offer up a new world of light.
nikon d3x is a clear winner .
so, a weather sealed camera with top notch construction is a major consideration.
problem is, the movies i have seen are terrible, with jerky motion.
i hate having to spend hours and hours getting rid of dust spots on my images.
it has one great advantage over the nikon d3x, and that is sensor cleaning.
the real market for both the d3x and the 1ds mark iii, is not nature photographers, it is the professional photographer who does studio work, weddings, or the sports shooters and newspaper reporters who use the camera on a daily basis.

yes, a canon xti will produce great images, i have some to prove it, but it won’t last very long with the kind of travel photography that i do.
why?  well, first, it tops the megapixel race.
at 24mp there is nothing out there, other than the sony alpha, that offers this much resolution.
wow, it may offer those of us who do both landscapes and wildlife photography a great resource.
heck, one trip will buy any of these cameras, and i do about four major trips per year.
i can buy a 1ds mark iii for about $1,500 less than the d3x.
both the mk iii and the d3x are good top of the line pro cameras.
i am pleased with the 1ds mark ii, although the speed of the 1d mark iin and the 1.3 multiplier sure is great for wildlife.

most consumer grade cameras won’t get close to that number.
but, canon does not rate it as a professional grade camera.
and it can do neat stuff, like move into another mode and capture shots at less megapixels but with astonishing speed.
well, first, it tops the megapixel race.
but, it will cost one heck of a lot more than the 1ds mark iii which is available today.
my quandary is wanting one camera that will do both, one that will withstand the rough treatment of travel and usage.
replacing my canon lenses with nikon lenses will push the price tag close to $20,000!
your email address will not be published.
but, in terms of image quality, in my opinion, it is as good as the nikon.
nikon d3x is an awesome camera .

five years ahead, we might very well be totally shocked at what is produced as technology gets better and better.

i just stumbled upon your blog and wanted to say that i have really enjoyed browsing your blog posts.
very high resolution and reduced resolution for images per second.
five years ago we could not have foreseen what the technology would produce in such a short time.
even if the camera is what canon says it is, i am still concerned about whether it will withstand the rigors i know i will put it through.
i want something that works when the light is there before me.
if he really means it, he should dump all his canon equipment, not even consider nikon, and immediately run out and buy a couple of mamiya rz67 pro iid bodies, a bunch of lenses, 2 leaf backs, and a bunch of car batteries.
nikon’s announcement of this camera is receiving lots of interest by serious photographers.
but, i suspect that there are lots of photographers like myself out in the real world who are going through the same process that i am, that are looking at real choices that are available now.
i can’t up the frames per second by choosing a different format.

and choices of lenses will be the bane of the photographer.
and it can do neat stuff, like move into another mode and capture shots at less megapixels but with astonishing speed.
one example is “black silicon” which is 100-500 times more sensitive to light that current silicon used in sensors.
course, the major consideration for me is that i own lots of canon l glass.
but, one thing is for sure, i don’t envision that anytime soon i would have the funds to jump into the medium format arena.
which is superior is splitting hairs and, if you have one, the question of buying the other should be answered by your accountant.
the 1ds mark iii originally hit the market at around that amount as well.

i can buy one for about $2,700, which is substantially less than the d3x and the 1ds iii.
