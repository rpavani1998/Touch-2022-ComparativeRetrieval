many of these cameras, like canon powershots and nikon coolpix actually have macro modes that bring you closer than most lenses for the dslrs–and lcd viewing screens can give you a better idea of the final result tham through the lens viewing on a dslr.for example, a 70mm lens on a nikon d70 digital slr will show you the same angle of view as a 105mm lens on a 35mm camera.you should know that lcd equipped non-slr digital cameras actually have some advantages over heavier (and apparently more professional) dslrs.canon always seems to be a little ahead in digital technology, while nikon lenses may be just a little bit better.nikon lens on a nikon dslr have an equivalent focal ange of 1.5x the same lens put on a 35mm camera.for this reason, the nikon 10.5mm digital fisheye, shown in the photo at the top of this story, actually reduces the image optically inside the lens.the 1:1 ratio makes wide angles photography much easier (although you lose the telephoto free-ride kicker).this is great for telephoto lenses, essentially a free ride with greater magnification.as you get interested in digital photography, you may want to “move up” from a point-and-shoot style digital camera to a digital single lens reflex (“dslr”).once you learn toprocess these in photoshop or photoshop elements, you’ll get far better results than with photos saved as jpeg files.i often get questions from readers about what digital cameras they should buy.for macro shots, i use a 105mm macro lens, with the camera always on a tripod, and a set of 1x, 2x, and 3x extension tubes.paparazzi on february 26, 2007 at 5:24 pm [...] air temperature may be chilly, but everyone is warm and friendly, sharing shop talk about canon versus nikon and the like.for example, a reader writes: i can’t seem to get the macro shots i want with my current camera, and want to buy a dslr.but it is not so cool for wide angle lenses, and makes it hard to get true extreme wide angle shots with your dslr.
