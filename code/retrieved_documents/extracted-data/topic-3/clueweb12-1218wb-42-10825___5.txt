last night mark downloaded  the ice chart and the pack ice is 80 miles to the north.
in short, the sensor produced great images to start with when using a low iso and then genuine fractals did the rest.

boththese cameras are apparently doing very well.
they never published any calendar we did together that featured the photography smaller than 16×20 inches and never once did they complain.

if you’re interested you can read about my last trip to this amazing wilderness on our blog/corkboard.
with the announcement  of the gf2 panasonic seems to have taken two steps back when they could have  gone two steps forward.
the story jeanne described, as usual, was hilarious with the central  theme pivoting on the idea that the agent just could not get the concept that  the boat she was scheduled to board was something smaller than the typical 1500  passenger cruise ship.
understand that i was one of the very few photographers who actually bought nikon’s d2h that sported a measly 4.1 megapixel sensor.
i like the pro roller option the best since obviously i can keep my  eye on my gear.
i fell in love with the gf1 for several reasons.
i hooked this little device up to the d7000 several times and it recorded those images with an exact gps location that are noted as a small red pin on the places section within aperture.

i specifically state nikon since canon’s version of the flexible program is a bit different and can be frustrating to rely on.
not the largest they  make in the pro roller series but not the smallest either.
the ice is nearly 80 miles offshore, so any bears that are stranded on the islands of svalbard migrate towards the top getting as close to the ice pack as possible.
svalbard, norway two years ago on my first trip to svalbard we found a dead whale, floating in the waters of holmiabukta.
read more... on our recent winter photography tour to yellowstone national park i had a chance to capture some exciting images that just would not have been possible without the high iso capabilities of the nikon d700.
if nikon can sell to the masses, the technology and research eventually makes it over to the more serious professional side.
was easy enough to straighten out but i’m guessing the connection is going to give at some point if i continue doing that.

olympus and panasonic chose the micro 4/3′s route with a magnification factor of 2x. nikon decided to go with an even smaller sensor that has a magnification factor of 2.7x. below i’ve included a graphic provided bycameradebate.com that gives you an easier to understand visual of the differences between all these different sized digital capture sensors.

nikon has given us several options for changing the camera over to a dx format which also increases the frame rate.
for two days now we’ve had skies with virtually no clouds.
however, i believe if more photographers would investigate the benefits of the flexible program option, in the nikon system, they would come to understand the tremendous benefits.

all the photos were shot at 2500 iso except for the last image which was shot at 1600 iso.

please note that the size of the visuals are not the actual size of the sensors but rather size comparisons of all options.
what’s  particularly interesting about this case is it’s semi-transformer  personality.
all of these issues required the use of a great sensor that can handle low-light conditions with ease.

additionally, i shot that camera like i do all digital cameras which means i shot it as if i were shooting 35mm film.
first and  foremost when in the alaska wilderness you want to make sure you stay dry so i  highly recommend bringing a good quality rain/waterproof jacket.
as i mentioned in an earlier post, it seems there is another camera missing from nikon’s lineup that truly would be a competitor to the eos 5d mark iii.
i’ll be snooping and pocking and asking lots of questions about this, that and lots of other things.
a guess but enough time in the outdoors makes it relatively accurate.

surprisingly, with  all the necessary restrictions we had a fairly productive shoot capturing  walrus coming and going.
i carry a small body with a minimum of 28mm lens to record special moments that i find while traveling.
additional reasons for needing the ability to go to a higher iso was the relatively low light due to it being early morning with heavy overcast and falling snow.

i’ll be getting something a bit more robust for my travels in the  future but for now the air temperature feels something close to 45f.
the one downside is that the device plugs into the  side of the camera and makes it a bit uncomfortable to hold not to mention  i’ve bent the connection at least twice.

the old rule of thumb is a shutter speed equal to or greater than the length of the lens you are shooting and that’s if you just want to steady minor lens shake from hand holding.

as most of the comments above show, using anything but manual or aperture priority is not very popular.

first and foremost when in the alaska wilderness you want to make sure you stay dry so i highly recommend bringing a good quality rain/waterproof jacket.
here you will find all the details and if you like you can even signup for the same adventure yourself for next year.

was easy enough to straighten  out
it’s never been easer to be prepared for that special image that presents itself.
i’m hoping to get my hands on one or both to give them a good once over.
it was partially beached, the underside of its  large, bloated carcass coming aground on the bottom of the fjord, 50 feet or  more from the gray, rocky shoreline recently void of ice.
i’ll be getting something a bit more robust for my travels in the future but for now the air temperature feels something close to 45f.

what’s particularly interesting about this case is it’s semi-transformer personality.

jeanne, one of our dear and long-time friends, and a retired, 30-year 757 pilot for united airlines, arrived in longyearbyen minus her luggage.
true to form she had a huge smile on her face and lots of great stories about the turmoil she faced trying to explain to the “lost luggage department” where they needed to deliver her bags once they found them.

first of all when tanya and i travel together and particularly when we  leave north america i almost always use the lowepro roller bags.
we’ve incorporated this  trip into ourinvitational photo tours schedule so we’ll be meeting  numerous guests who’ve become friends and a few new faces that have never  traveled with us before.
i’m disappointed not to be able to get an accurate reading of the outside temps.

equally amazing is that i first started hearing people talk about the “unusual year” over ten years ago.
this morning is cold.
i hooked this little device up to the d7000 several times and it recorded  those images with an exact gps location that are noted as a small red pin on  the places section within aperture.
we were all thrilled to be taking pictures.
might even be able to talk my friends in to letting me give them a try.
if you’re interested you  can read about my last trip to this amazing wilderness on our   blog/corkboard.

these images were shot at 1/1600th of a second to make sure we stopped the action.
stay tuned and stop by to see what i come up with.
during our original visit we spent several days working the nearly dozen or so bears that were feasting on the cetaceation’s rotting flesh.
why was the d700 so advantageous?
below is a video i created from still images that i shot of two coyotes fighting over breeding rights and territorial dominancy.

i’m not a big fan of  labeling the exact location of every photo but for the arctic documentary  project this technology is a tremendous asset.
a fancy little red car in the lot of our hotel in oslo.
i was hoping desperately the new improvements would take the  panasonic line of mirrorless cameras to the next level.
before i left i purchased thenikon gps unit gp-1 for the d7000.
with the announcement of the gf2 panasonic seems to have taken two steps back when they could have gone two steps forward.
fast motion and powerful telephotos require a faster shutter speed.
on the back side of the inner case are backpack straps that make it easy to sling over your shoulders.
first, these two aggressive creatures were moving very, very fast.
it’s a guess but enough time in the outdoors makes it relatively accurate.
summer brown bear photography in alaska has a few special requirements.
i carry a small body with a minimum of 28mm lens to record special  moments that i find while traveling.
well, a lot of things can change in two weeks and so they have with nikon finally joining the mirrorless group with their introduction of a new line of photographic tools called the nikon 1 j1 and the nikon 1 v1.
there in the midst of darkest death was the angelic  like wings of an ivory gull as purely white as its name described, a bird of  such beauty in this scene of death.
this situation was exactly the type of opportunity i keep my d700 around for.
it’s good for everyone wanting to capture great memories.
we’ll all have to wait to see if this will be a serious flaw to the new line of nikon cameras since in general, smaller sensors produce lower quality images.
before i left i  purchased thenikon gps unit gp-1 for the d7000.
equally amazing is that i first  started hearing people talk about the “unusual year” over ten years  ago.
the story jeanne described, as usual, was hilarious with the central theme pivoting on the idea that the agent just could not get the concept that the boat she was scheduled to board was something smaller than the typical 1500 passenger cruise ship.
there are so many great options to choose  from today such as nikon advanced coolpix 5700.

the good stuff is towards the middle and below.
the moment she boarded the bobbing smorgasbord of blubber, skin and barnacles, the feasting young bruin came sprinting down the carcass length, diving off the other end, leaping into the water in a full race horse gallop.

by  zipping out the inside protective enclosure you remove the hard sided outer  shell.
around 10:00am we caught the well-organized, pleasant and  clean bus to the airport.
the night passed quickly, never  really getting dark.
rising from my bunk and making my way into the galley was painful due to the intense glare off the water.

gulls scattered in every direction lifting off to hang in the gusting winds blowing from the glacier.
i can see this being extremely useful for  documenting specific areas within the arctic for the arctic documentary  project.
i just have to let things flow.

will be extremely nice once all cameras have this  technology built in and able to turn on and off at will.

photo tip keeping a camera close has always been the answer to great pictures.
the first trip went really well, but every adventure to the field is new, so it’s always in your mind that the the next can be even better.
soon i will be there  again and this blog post is the beginning of my report from what is an  incredible land of ice, water, wildlife and sky.
a minimal backpack harness good for short hauls onto a plane or a few hundred yards to a blind.
nikon has a built-in flash.

the canon has no such options.
if not then they will only be cameras for the point and shoot crowd.
it was a surreal site,  sometimes four polar bears distributed its length, standing their ground, their  teeth tearing at the hide of the ghastly, bloated corpse.
it’s never been easer to be prepared for that special image that presents  itself.

nikon 1 v1 mirrorless camera
i’ve supplied dozens of images to a german calendar publisher that were proceed from the d2h and these guys are picky.
with the introduction of these two cameras they have brought some interesting new technologies to the game that sound quite interesting.
i’m really hoping they will be amazing!
the brilliance sent me  scurrying back to my dark, little cabin to retrieve sunglasses before making my  way on deck.
it’s a bit large for smaller planes overhead bins but with a  quick zip of the inner case, you can reduce it’s size substantially.
rising from my bunk and making my way into the galley  was painful due to the intense glare off the water.
i’m disappointed not to be able to get an accurate reading of the outside  temps.
skip to that if you don’t care for my period of warming up.
