this may be a dedicated depth of field preview button.
there is a new ‘rate’ button, second from top in the row of buttons on the left side of the lcd.
this post is a quick comparison between the latest nikon and canon full-frame digital slrs.
full-frame cameras, by virtue of their large sensors, have much better low-light performance, color rendition, dynamic range (the range of levels it can show between highlight and shadow) than their aps-c cousins.
- the ‘menu and info buttons have moved up from their previous positions to the left of the viewfinder.
something that its competitor- the nikon d700 completely lacked; a higher megapixel sensor, and was overall lighter than the d700.

high dynamic range (hdr) mode.
this makes it much better in terms of quickly turning on the camera and shooting.
shutter durability of 150,000 cycles.
the differences are more for their handling and features over and above great iq.
- improved metering which allows better scene recognition, including face detection.
apart from that, the top bank of buttons near the top lcd are the same.
5 fps with battery grip, 6 fps in dx mode.
a full-frame sensor (36mm x 24mm) has the same physical dimensions as 35mm film.
- shutter durability of 150,000 cycles.
- quiet shooting mode.

the ‘eos 5d’ badge is more 7d like.
- new af module capable of focusing at low light down to -2ev.
full hd 1080 movie, including raw hd output over hdmi.
there is also an additional (probably picture control) button between the selector wheel and joystick at the back.
the d700 did have a superior autofocus (af) system, but that was really about it.
most consumer dslrs have smaller sensors, called aps-c sensors (25mm x 16mm, which stands for advanced photo system type-classic).
this seems to be a dedicated video recording button.
- full hd 1080 movie, including raw hd output over hdmi.
you also tend to get shallower depth of field for the same aperture on a full-frame than on an aps-c camera.
the differences are more for their handling and features over and above great iq.
an additional button added to the front, at approximately 8 o’clock when the mount is viewed from the front.
it had great video shooting capabilities-
there is a new ‘rate’ button, second from top in the row of buttons on the left side of the lcd.
quiet shooting mode.
- 61 point autofocus, up to 41 cross type sensors.
the d700 did have a superior autofocus (af) system, but that was really about it.
- 51 point autofocus with 15 cross-type sensors.
a few observations about the 5dm3′s design (based solely on the leaked pictures): canon has finally fixed the position of the on/off switch from near the back lower right of the lcd to the top of the camera, behind the main mode selector.
51 point autofocus with 15 cross-type sensors.
last month, nikon came back roaring to release the d800.
61 point autofocus, up to 41 cross type sensors.
shutter durability of 200,000 cycles.
depth of field preview?) button close to the shutter release.
depth of field preview?) button close to the shutter release.
improved durability, water and dust resistance.
you also tend to get shallower depth of field for the same aperture on a full-frame than on an aps-c camera.
- silent and low vibration shooting modes.
- improved weather sealing and durable magnesium alloy construction.
this makes it much better in terms of quickly turning on the camera and shooting.
it’s specifications list is quite impressive: 36.3 megapixel full frame cmos sensor.
apart from that, the top bank of buttons near the top lcd are the same.
it had great video shooting capabilities-
improved metering which allows better scene recognition, including face detection.
a 36 megapixel imaging monster, this camera delivers almost every conceivable video option and then some.
there is also an additional (probably picture control) button between the selector wheel and joystick at the back.
not to be outdone, here comes canon’s 5d mark iii (as yet unreleased): what is inside is equally as impressive: 22.3 megapixel full frame cmos sensor.
the information presented here is not official canon information, but a very reliable leak a few hours before the actual announcement.
