is film or digital better?
(seemy  photoshop directory for some useful scripts, including those that were used to  generate the jpegs you see on this page.)
after you have felt the full impact of the above  photo, go read bob atkins'preview of the canon 1d mark iii.
looking back over this entire thread, it is astonishing how emotional people can get over film v. digital and canon v. nikon, etc.
had i not invested a good number of canon l glasses, i would definitely go for mamiya or nikon d3.
except the lcd screen.
film is more organic and like many examples of older technology it will always have its place and use and class (i have a fine omega mechanical wristwatch; sure it isn't as accurate as a quartz watch but it has class).
but it's time to get something more durable and higher  resolution.
this is not a great idea when trying to shoot a wedding.
at the 10k range, the benefit of mf is obvious, the single pixel size (pitch) is much larger (8.4um) than the 1ds mkiii's 6.4um.
owning a 30d with satisfies me quite well, i must say that i miss the  perspectives of the full frame, 5d is definitely the choice for me.
while i was impressed with the images, i'm disappointed that i'm returned the camera again.
i suggest mr. greenspun do a little more research before making completely invalid statements which mislead camera buyers and uniformed photographers.
for taking pictures of sporting events without breaking your arm, you'll  want acanon ef 300mm f/4l is usm, (compare prices) (review).
clients get  nervous and models get bored and lose interest, you have to capture the moment
it is much cheaper for canon to make a small sensor than a big sensor.
i am assuming this  lens is not designed for the 5d. could someone with more knowledge on this  issue please expound?
i am aware that there appears to have been a batch of 5d's that had dust  problems, but mine (luckly) was not one of them and when i did finally get  somedust on the sensor (bad handling on my part), it was easy enough to clean  w/o the need for a sensor cleaning kit or canon' service facility.
my 20d exposes backlighting perfectly and this camera costs over half as much of a 5d.
if someone is prepared to arm themselves with generic photographic  techniques in order to digitally capture the best possible image in front of  the camera, then manipulate that image's properties to produce a work of art,  then surely their efforts and dedication to the photographic art should be  encouraged and commended?
i have covered a  summarised review on my website: http://digital_camera_reviews.protechltd.com folarin s , february 05, 2009; 09:00 p.m. a new perspective as a new member on photo.net,i have to say that many of the above views  relating to the respective merits of film vs. digital and full frame vs 1.6  crop factor have been tremendously helpful.
cody jorgensen , june 03, 2007; 06:28 p.m. i know that the first comment on this review, that discusses the debate between film vs.
i'm wondering if anyone else is having this problem.
without some kind of linguistic shorthand here, we are going to have to teach basic physics every time we try to discuss lens selection--leaving the typical photographer with either glazed eyes or a dumbfounded expression.
colin mark chapman , may 21, 2007; 03:10 p.m. i was just at my local jessops store & the guy there told me that production on the 5d has now ceased!
arunas salkauskas , december 10, 2006; 02:09 a.m. "a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
that change makes sense.
i do like the fact that it does have the 35mm size sensors and that it is built so similar to the 30d. i have been price checking and find several hundred dollars variation in prices.
i have to admit, however, that both the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x shoot more frames per second than the 5d.
things keep changing.
it also allows me a  greater amount of control over the in camera exposure settings and my results  are getting better all the time.
of course,  the resolution of the 5d is so high that you could pull out the central 8 mp of  a canon eos 5d image and it would be almost as though you had taken the photo  with a canon 30d or digital rebel.
i have to agree totally with this review of the 5d. as one who has shot  leica equipment for over 30 years, this was the system of choice for me when i  decided to make the transition from my trusty leica r8's & leica lenses to  the digital world of the 5d with ef-l lenses.
you  can't keep adjusting your lights and changing your settings.
i see the 5d more adequated for great prints  with their big sensor allied with excelent characteristics.
i really don't enjoy the digital darkroom.
jean-baptiste avril , may 23, 2006; 03:55 p.m.ellypses bought an eos 5d two months ago.
this is one area where the canon eos 1ds justifies its $7000 price with a standard professional 100 percent viewfinder.
it always fascinates me, just how much passion can be stirred up by the discussion of an artistic tool, in this case, the 5d. i guess painters must debate paintbrush issues as hotly on their forums??
on the price, are you getting one used?
i found it very relaxing.
robert sault , january 31, 2008; 08:06 p.m. i just talked to canon on the phone today, and they have no plans for a  makeover of the 5d, it will possibly be the 7d in q3/q4 of 08.
i am hoping to use a d2x and get the same quality but maybe the 5d  will do well.
do you recommend a 5d for what i do?
this month covers the topic of  white balance.
the auto iso is one of the best features that can be put into a digital slr.
what about autofocus in 5d. i've heard lot complaints from those who  used nikon d200 and switched to canon 5d. after this they appreciate af they  used to have in nikon.
it does just about everything that an $7000 eos 1ds body from 2004 did at about half the weight (2 lbs).
i had two samples of this camera sent to me by b&h and canon broke my  heart twice (actually 3 times!).
and traditional slides still have more of both, resoloution and contrast.
had i not invested a good number of  canon l glasses, i would definitely go for mamiya or nikon d3.
i've got one issue to  clear up.
so, please  tell me that canon did some progress in this case in 5d best regards radek buck lovell , july 13, 2007; 05:44 p.m. philip greenspuns very ignorant statement in his review "the  small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses"  bring into question his entire review.
by the same token, i cannot afford any of the more upmarket canon full frame digitals.
we  have millions of average joe's with an $800 dslr that can produce great quality  artistic photos.....and that will obviously blow the ego of anyone who's  labored in a darkroom for any amount of time.
if the 5d is a tough as my 30d i will be well pleased.
i have used a canon 1ds mark i and ii and i found the quality to be excellent.
where to buy you may still be able to find the canon eos 5d, (compare prices),  available from one of our partners.
you cannot use those mediums in the same way yet you have what  is called a 'painting' in the end.
again, my answer is only a guess.
i received my 5d for xmass this year.
you know that a good print (say lambda) must be 300dpi to be called a good photo-print...and so?
contributed content used with permission.
i agree it would be nice to have the price of canon l series drop.
p.m. straight  from the camera, no photoshop except to sign & size it.
i will go digital when they make the first 1,000,000 dollar digital camera which will be 108mp mamiya ofcourse, and it will accept all my rb67 lenses and ektars.
article revised february 2011.
i have a friend that purchased a 40d. he likes the fps but wishes he had purchased the 5d. if you have not used a 5d, perhaps you might borrow or rent one and see if it suits you.
having recently found a great deal on a 16-35l,it seems clear that i should do the right thing and move from a rebel to a 5d(mkii still a little pricey) to get the full-impact of the glass.
four years old and still no dust in the viewfinder.
concerning film versus digital: both have advantages, but it is mainly a  very personal question.
(am i making any sense?)
the best test really is to hand the camera to a novice and see what happens.
i can't get close to that with my d200.
to recharge the battery you must carry a chunky travel charger that plugs directly into a wall socket.
of course, the resolution of the 5d is so high that you could pull out the central 8 mp of a canon eos 5d image and it would be almost as though you had taken the photo with a canon 30d or digital rebel.
if the rumors are true and canon is going to come out with a replacement to the 5d i might be interested in that as well.
after you have felt the full impact of the above photo, go read bob atkins'preview of the canon 1d mark iii.
having taught photography back in the days when dinosaurs were just crawling out from the sea, i think 'wet' photography will be with us for a long time just as oil on canvas is still here.
so i am in the same: will continue scanning till they get a product that won't be obsolete in less than five years.
digital is just someone's opinion, but i find it highly  inflammatory for no reason at all.
do you want to have all your work essentially be defined by 1's and zero's?
no dings, scratches, and best of all no internal damage to camera or  lens.
i've found the review quite irritating for more or less the same reasons that vincent martin wrote about -despite
be smart, do the  research.
if you're considering purchasing this camera from an online retailer, buyer beware.
when using digital you need to 'think' digital.
thus you're able to manually adjust focus but have automatic assistance  available when desired.
the only disadvantage to having a full-frame sensor compared  to a small-sensor digital slr body (canon digital rebel or any nikon) is that  the small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses,  which can be useful when you are doing sports or bird photography.
or you'll lose the momentum.
i loved the slide films in the studio.
i know the problem from my old film eos and i've never been happy  about this af.
i'll have to bring (perhaps even legally) that case to their marketting dpt as 3000 euros is quiet an investement, even for a professional.
nedine o'brien , february 27, 2007; 06:21 a.m. greetings all, i've only been studying photography for three years and started doing b&w film in a wet darkroom.
but  if you use the camera like a creative tool maybe the question makes a little  more sense.
hi brian-i don't think i am really qualified to answer any questions in  this forum but will take a guess at the answer to this one simply because no  one else has replied.
it's just a hard camera to use for glamour.
any price that would fall more than, lets say,  20% or more out of that was proven to be a scam (in all cases).
this is one area where the canon eos 1ds justifies its $7000 price with a  standard professional 100 percent viewfinder.
having taught  photography back in the days when dinosaurs were just crawling out from the  sea, i think 'wet' photography will be with us for a long time just as oil on  canvas is still here.
p.m. anyone know when canon will be updating the 5d?
i think i will prbably not upgrade to the canon 5d mk ii as it is too expensive but will wait for the next eolution to appear.
that's why 5d is such an amazing gear, will so is  the nikon d3.
only canon builds dslr with full frame sensor right now.
here are some things that would be nice for the next version of the 5d: reminder of what iso speed is set automatic iso mode smart enough to look at the shutter speed and whether  or not the camera is sufficiently stable (i.e., tripod or not) and set the iso  accordingly to avoid camera shake compared to the cheaper canon bodies can you get a dramatically better photo with the eos 5d and a canon 50/1.4  compared to what you'd get withcanon digital rebel xti (black) and sigma 30mm  f/1.4
while i was impressed with  the images, i'm disappointed that i'm returned the camera again.
flash system is average.
nicholas eskey , april 03, 2008; 02:10 a.m. i was in ritz camera store today, looking to see if they still had canon  5d's in stock, since most of the camera stores in san diego seem to not, and i  spoke with the counter guy about it.
the 13-megapixel canon eos 5d single-lens reflex digital camera is the first consumer-priced ($2700) full-frame sensor body.
some artists work with a knife and others with a fine brush.
the underscore means the white space was changed from srgb to adobe  rgb.
i think i may be selling this one soon.
thanks~shellie ringo taylhardat , february 07, 2010; 09:06 p.m. i am planning on buying a used 5d for $1500.00, as i am on a strict budget.
but i noticed right away when shooting some models with strobes, they looked like crap and i though my light meter was off.
i love the medium format slides in the glassed gepe frames.
add a comment ed sweeney , may 18, 2006; 07:18
as a  canon user with too much money sunk into the system to switch on a whim like  the beginners without a good set of lenses or the moneyed elite who seem to  switch weekly, i hope that nikon absolutely trounces canon with its new full  frame d3 and its d300 cameras.
george pentzikis , january 15, 2007; 03:22 p.m. tc-80n3.
is there a view that the 5d is just the first full frame pro-sumer digital  that will soon be replaced by canon?
if you do not create your art and have a bonafide craft in digital art (like making fantastic looking things painstakingly in photoshop or other based primarily on visions in your head), then you are basically putting your faith in those who decided how a certain color etc. should be rendered on a screen ie color spaces, color balance and the like.
i do weddings, seniors, kids, families etc...  i'm a canon user
but i've read all the review
i know i don't need glasses.
05:07 a.m. i have had my canon 5d for about 10 weeks now and i love it a superb camera,you can crop a small part of a file and the result is still very good,i also like the idea of changing the iso for each shot when i want to and i can do it just over a second with no bother at all,the only setting i use is the iso 50 setting for when i want to use it,some times i use the mirror setting so when you press the shutter release the mirror shoots up and went you press the shuter release again it will take the photo which is a good idea when taking macro shots as the mirror will not vibrate then !
brandon boghosian , may 26, 2008; 10:55 p.m. alan, the same way hybrid's are killing the suv market.
and, that there are no plans for an upgrade or the inevertable 3d.
http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/tc-80n3.shtml, http://www.usa.canon.com/html/cameras_slr/eos3acc.html michael brown , january 23, 2007; 12:55 a.m. vincent, that is the most ridiculous statement i have ever heard.
robert nurse , may 23, 2007; 02:45 p.m. dof button?
can someone please explain this?
like me, they have taken the time and effort to understand, for example, what a colour space is and whether a device uses an rgb or cymk model.
mister ken (given to me by my students in egypt) image attachment: 0303 needs restoration battleshiprs800.jpg felix müller , september 08, 2006; 03:24 p.m. how can you call $2900.00 consumer-priced?
ok  sure and when i whip out the 11x14 empire state and make selinium oxide silver  contact prints (or whatever they are called) you will see who has cooler  pictures.
i noticed the vingetting.
there was one less mis-interpretation of the  colour of the original.
a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a  3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
the canon eos 5d has an almost identical and equally simple user interface  to the cheaper canon 20d and 30d bodies.
note that, as with most digital single lens reflex cameras, the 5d cannot provide you with a preview in the rear lcd because the sensor is occluded by the viewing mirror until you press the shutter release.
even a camera like the d40 has a much superior lcd than the 5d.tests say the nikon's vibration reduction system is better than canon's is system.
however, the issue of the cropping factor continues to be a source of frustration.
p.m. combining the 5d's high iso cleanliness + is provides hand held capabilities previously unheard of erwin baeyens , august 13, 2007;
with the 50/1.4 lens: the 16-35/2.8l lens: the 24-70/2.8l lens (mostly from the robinson r44): one perceived problem with professional-grade cameras is that they can't be used by novices.
i just wonder whether the 'dust  magnet' issue will come back to haunt me further down the line.
evita m , october 17, 2006; 03:42 a.m. "digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images " i still think it's the one behind the lens who makes an image terrific or not, the camera itself, whatever camera, just makes a picture.
canon  still has a bit to learn from nikon in some areas.
the d2xs is a superb camera, but don't have the large canon's sensor nor  the tremendous s5 dynamic range.
p.m. hello all, i am in the market for a new pro camera - i currently do "pro"  work with a nikon d70
i can do in 15 minutes what used to  take me all day in the dark room
such are the relative natures  of well-established and on the other hand, emerging technologies.
when you are deciding on which lens designed for 24 x 36 should be used with a camera having a sensor 2/3 the length and width of that, you can use the multiplicative inverse of 2/3, which is 1.5, and thereby compute what the effective focal length will be as it affects magnification, i.e., image size.
one last thing, i found my 28-80 was not wide enough in some situations for weddings.
if you're going to take a lot of portraits, e.g., of a baby, and don't  want to endure the weight of the 70-200/2.8, consider a primecanon ef 100mm f/2  usm, (compare prices) (review).
there are many settings if  you would need them but to many for what i need,i will not need another camera
i still have my old pentax and it is loaded, but i don't know when i'll find the time to take it off the shelf and finish the roll.
but canon doesn't communicate at all on problems with this particular lens and generally says it efficient in all situations.
dedicated canon accessory flash units mount in the hot shoe above the viewfinder and the camera is able to control flash exposure via a through-the-lens sensor.
add some fantastic filters (which digital users throw away now) and accessories and you will be taking phenominal pictures no matter what.
do you want to have all your  work essentially be defined by 1's and zero's?
you lose image stabilization, but gain one f-stop in aperture so you can use higher shutter speeds and the viewfinder will be brighter.
i will never miss the kodak 14n that it replaced, although i occasionally miss the aperture rings on my nikon lenses that i had to sell to be able to get both (1) full frame and (2) low noise at high iso.
even tried my hand at oil.
vermac santos , march 31, 2007; 07:52 p.m. jonathan, i'm in the same dilemma, thinking about 5d, finepix s5 or simply  buy a nikon fisheye for my d200 for my landscape images.
after that i've found so many scams like that one that i  recommend everyone doing the same before they buy their camera online.
i would  not sell any of my images.
i am aware that there appears to have been a batch of 5d's that had dust problems, but mine (luckly) was not one of them and when i did finally get somedust on the sensor (bad handling on my part), it was easy enough to clean w/o the need for a sensor cleaning kit or canon' service facility.
it is also interesting to look here if you want to get one indicator of  relative market shares for the various companies, not just canon and nikon--and  not just at the high end.
i will never  miss the kodak 14n that it replaced, although i occasionally miss the aperture  rings on my nikon lenses that i had to sell to be able to get both (1) full  frame and (2) low noise at high iso.
i have done clay, batique as well as crayons.
reliability and durability i've had this eos 5d for nearly a year and it has survived a trip through  mexico and being vibrated for two cross-country helicopter trips.
nikon is a small company with clever optical engineers.
vermac santos , march 31, 2007; 07:52 p.m. jonathan, i'm in the same dilemma, thinking about 5d, finepix s5 or simply buy a nikon fisheye for my d200 for my landscape images.
i don't agree totally with your post vincent-.
(i flew the jet ranger helicopter on the left for three hours while  commander chuck street reported the traffic and talked me through the  occasional confined or pinnacle approach; i did not fly the helicopter on the  right, which is a static display at the titan missile museum near tucson,  arizona.)
saying  this though, your sigma lens should produce 17mm pictures without a problem.
steve wright , december 21, 2006; 10:15 p.m. well.. what to say?
in other words an image captured with the camera held vertically will  appear on a computer screen in a vertical orientation.
(the guys you see  on television might have the 600/4, but that comes in its own suitcase and  costs more than a small kia sedan.)
the 5d, on the other hand, is better in the following situations: the canon eos 5d has an almost identical and equally simple user interface to the cheaper canon 20d and 30d bodies.
i believe that you have to approach digital completely differently to  film.
if you downloadmicrosoft raw image thumbnailer and viewer for windows xp, you can sort photos to some extent just using the standard windows file browser.
however, the issue of the cropping factor continues to be a source of  frustration.
if you are rich and dumb, i would definitly suggest  going digital.
that difference really shows now that the making of cameras has come down to "how much can you invest in silicon chips?" the canon eos 5d is the essential camera for everything that photographers used to do with 35mm film.
do i need a xsi or a 5d?
tom moore , january 25, 2007; 08:35 p.m. i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with  film.
i still can't get over that 5d viewfinder, though, and that's the one absolutely unavoidable drawback of four thirds - technology improvements and price/size economies mean the smaller sensors will just lag 35mm sensors by two or three years (in resolution and sensitivity), but there's no way with that imaging circle to get abigger viewfinder image than the e1's.
i was not sure what you meant by "effect".
in very practical terms, that  is, a 600mm lens will give results in terms of image size comparable to 900mm  lens when used on a sensor approximately 2/3 the length and width of a full  frame sensor.
cheers michael brown , july 29, 2007; 06:40
there is no color settings to adjust the lcd, you can only adjust the brightness levels.
wow that would have been sweet.
the canon 5d mark 2 has generally been given rave reiviews and has be tagged as the wedding photographers camera of choice.
i  love the medium format slides in the glassed gepe frames.
i also want to use my 50mm 1.4,  especially for low-light photography, so the 5d is the only choice.
by that time i hope nikon will also be  truly in te (full) frame and be producing a lower price competitor so that i  can think aout returning to nikon.
highlights can burn out much easier and in the  shadows the transition from very dark to real black can be quite sudden.
but if you would like to present your  pictures to your friends an family or any other larger group of people you do a  slideshow.
there are few industries as heart-wrenching as the fine art business.
i don't agree totally with  your post vincent-.
the only exception to this rule is if you try to  take pictures continuously at a rate that exceeds three photos per second.
bernie ess , april 01, 2007; 06:35
and you don't even need electricity for that one!!
any idiot can use a  7000 dollar digital camera.
the best  professional solution isadobe photoshop cs2, which comes with an image editing  tool called "adobe bridge".
so the 3 fps works well.
i also want to use my 50mm 1.4, especially for low-light photography, so the 5d is the only choice.
i will go digital when they make the first 1,000,000 dollar
the following images were taken at iso 800: batteries the included lith-ion battery is adequate for a day of active photography,  somewhere between 300 and 500 photos plus review.
ok...for a photojournalist, a sport phtographer, a reporter like for a  "common user" a digital vs. film question simply makes no sense.
and when i whip out the 11x14 empire state and make selinium oxide silver contact prints (or whatever they are called) you will see who has cooler pictures.
who  knows where digital will take us in the future?
odd that the canon tech didn't know this.)
" it's important to remember that even if you can scan something at a  million dots per inch - you may just be fooling yourself.
instead of buying a wider lens i opted to go with a bigger frame 5d. best regards.
cody jorgensen , june 03, 2007; 06:28 p.m. i know that the first comment on this review, that discusses the debate  between film vs.
i'm sort of at a loss.
single pixel size matters!
i don't know if the 3" lcd  will fit onto the back though.
claudia michael kelly , september 21, 2006; 10:48 a.m. i've gone through two eos 5d bodies in one week, both purchased from amazon.com.
search for similar products on pricegrabber results by  pricegrabber.com canon eos 5d 12.8 megapixel digital slr  camera body only vendor vendor rating availability price
it is the same as film and digital to me, you end up with a photograph at the end but they are not the same.
i got two cheap lenses: the ordinary ef 28-90 and a voigtlander 19-35mm.
but somehow, after a few  drinks that tasted wierd but have a tequila like effect, i figured that they  have some kind of machines were i could use a plastic card to get money out of  it.
the have been there and done that (film that is).
evita m , october 17, 2006; 03:42 a.m. "digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images " i still think it's the one behind the lens who makes an image terrific or  not, the camera itself, whatever camera, just makes a picture.
i don't know if the 3" lcd will fit onto the back though.
this  is a big step up from the 10d and 20d which i use for back up, but i agree that  the industry is geting too pricy for consumer or semi pro photographers.
personally i dislike taking hundreds of shots to get a few good ones and  take my time to capture a great photo.
the canon eos 5d has been replaced by the canon eos 5d mark ii, (compare prices) (review), and it might be more worth  your money to purchase the current version.
in addition, the build quality of nikon cameras is  legendary.
when i got my 5d things changed, there are no 'cheat' modes on this camera, you actually have to know what you are doing.
03:13 a.m. i started out with pen and ink, moved to pastels, charcoal, watercolor airbrushing.
i'm not saying one is better than the other.
guido ersettigh (milan) , october 08, 2006; 05:45 p.m. claudia our friend knows well perspective theory in fact he used a lens that lets you basculate its axis in order to correct perspective distortion along one direction - optical bank lets you move, thanks to the bellow system, in any direction so you can correct distortion along any axis or put an whole item in focus even if it's not parallel to the lens -.
i have much more respect for a photographer who creates a wonderful sunset  image with both the sky and foreground having a good balance of exposure than  someone who merged two images together and created a high dynamic range image.
a  cheaper alternative but still good is the tamron range of lenses and they go  down to f2.8 aswell for a fairly wide angled lens.
do a store review  before purchasing.
for some people, the film v digital argument is relevant and will  legitimately continue for a long time.
85mm for portrait, 28 as wide angle, and selective dof/ unsharpness when i wish.
xiaoyuan gu , november 28, 2007; 10:12 a.m. it is time for canon to throw the goodies of 1d mkiii and 40d to a 5d mkii,  to seriously compete with the nikon d3.
canon includes some image library management software with the eos 5d, including the zoom browser ex.
so, my procedure was the following: 1.

vertino machado david alpert , march 31, 2007; 11:31 p.m. the 5d is excellent in low light.
how much better  is eleven megapixels?
i have not thrown away  my watercolors or my 35 mm cameras etc., i have just added to what i enjoy.
and i am fine with 3-5 fps,  as i am, like most people out there, not a sport event shooter (5fps will do  the job well, though).
floyd h , february 28, 2007; 01:14 a.m.lcd screen troubles greetings camera fans, i've had my canon 5d for at least six months and everything is great
i still can't get over that 5d viewfinder, though, and that's the one  absolutely unavoidable drawback of four thirds - technology improvements and  price/size economies mean the smaller sensors will just lag 35mm sensors by two  or three years (in resolution and sensitivity), but there's no way with that  imaging circle to get abigger viewfinder image than the e1's.
the only exception to this rule is if you try to take pictures continuously at a rate that exceeds three photos per second.
if you need high frames per second, i would not recommend this camera.
not enough people have the resources to set up a full b&w/color photo lab to be able to manipulate photo's on the required level of "fine art".
if it is not going to be printed bigger than 8x10 or if it is for web use then virtually every digital becomes the same whether it is $150 or $3000.
these are all valid tools.
i have not experienced any camera software problems or freezes.
that difference really shows now that the  making of cameras has come down to "how much can you invest in silicon  chips?
so what's the  big deal?
maximum flash sync speed is 1/200th.
let the camera rest for a few minutes and the battery voltage will come back.
there is a difference between art and digital is all that i am saying.
he said i should hold off buying it, because that the next upgrade to the 5d was going to be announced pretty soon, ranging from $2500-3500.
these are all  valid tools.
amazon... not so much- trying to be everything to everyone has negatively impacted their customer service.
it lacks a proper lcd  display.
quico álvarez , december 06, 2007; 02:44 p.m. i found it: eos-5d is 12 bit per channel in color depth.
i put aside all thought of film and decided to  learn how to use digital properly.
i've seen some great stuff from my students using pin-hole cameras.
whatever software you choose to use, you won't have to spend too much time post-processing due to the eos 5d's inclusion of a mercury switch to orient photos.
in film, someone pains in a dark room for hours, using tangible tools that move and change light as its placed onto a print.
people throw away old  computers just like they will throw away digital cameras.
it is a patient studio photographer's camera.
personally i dislike taking hundreds of shots to get a few good ones and take my time to capture a great photo.
the light meter of both 5ds consistently underexposed when faced with backlit situations.
by that time i hope nikon will also be truly in te (full) frame and be producing a lower price competitor so that i can think aout returning to nikon.
no, nikon cannot match canon's  sensor technology;they are not the electronics giant that canon is.
a recent review of a top photo printer (and by that i mean one  costing over 500 pounds sterling, rather than in the 200 pounds sterling price  range) by someone experienced in both digital and darkroom techniques, said  that it produced the best prints he had ever seen, including those from a  traditional darkroom.
the full-frame canon eos 5d is cheaper than nikon's top-of-the-line small-sensor body.
without reading the manual, you can go into the custom function menu and the camera to lock up the mirror before taking a picture (then set self-timer mode on the drive button and the camera automatically configures itself for a 2-second self-timer delay; press the button and the mirror locks up, then the shutter opens two seconds later).
the 30d got jerked off a folding table and hit a concrete  floor and bounced first on one corner, next on the lens shade, and finally on  it's back.
karl westphal , april 28, 2007; 10:22 p.m. southern ladies i was thinking about buying a 5d but have decided to wait a month and buy a  1d mark iii.
but if  canon is so capable, why is their flash metering system so inferior compared to  nikon?
it is the  first in what olympus is calling it's om-d line of micro four thirds bodies.
microdrives work in the camera, but operate very slowly if you are taking 14 mb  raw images.
nikon's build quality  and ergronomics are way ahead of canon's.
i am waiting for the 5d mkii, and keeping my finger  crossed that canon with stay with 12mp to keep the single pixel size of 8.2um  of the 5d, and come up with a quality lcd such as that found on the new nikons,  dust removal (5d is a dust magnet) and liveview functions.
canon, forget about the megapixel and fps fight!
this  is very useful for tripod and macro work.
the only thing that worked was when the salesman used spot metering on the subject's face by going up in his face to lock in the exposure.
robert nurse , may 15, 2007; 11:41 a.m. hi beren, have you read anything about the 5d mark ii or any type of replacement?
wishlist for the canon eos 5d mark ii
but if you would like to present your pictures to your friends an family or any other larger group of people you do a slideshow.
i enjoyed making  prints in my dark room i did pr, weddings, events, sports, newspaper work,  portraits and even printed some in a couple of other peoples books.
review by philip greenspun, september 2006 (updated february 2011)
the 70-200mm f/4l is a lot cheaper (the f/4l is is cheaper  than the non-is f/2.8l) and a lot lighter (the f/4l is is about half the weight  of the f/2.8l is).
i enrolled in a digital class and things changed.
s3pro is what i liked best as far as digital.
the have been  there and done that (film that is).
although i have never shot either, the  specs on the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x are very, very impressive.
the 5d has the standard focus modes of any canon slr: manual, single-shot auto, continuous auto, and "ai focus" where the camera tries to figure out whether or not your subject is moving.
and colin, if you hear anything more about the end of 5d  production, please let us know.
although not the fastest camera for action shots, it is hardly "a patient studio photographer's camera," and no one who has used it would characterize it thus.
i've also lost a lot of digital files over the years, but i still have our old slides from the 1960's.
a  new lineup that is intended to attract a more... pentax k-01 preview eight neat products from ces 2012 latest learning articles three tips for selling/showing your photos in a gallery
well, i guess it's not a big news for you guys :).
more and more people are going digital, thus driving down demand and prices for film gear.
if they have not explored film far enough, and do not require some huge size out of the ordinary output, they probably will not know what they are missing switching to digital.
meanwhile it is instructive to look at the posts above if only to note that the predictions and rumours in them are all entirely wrong.
it really is a great camera for what i do, mainly  portraiture and some landscape.
it's status as 'last season's fashion' will help drive second hand prices lower.
alan cukurs , january 16, 2008; 01:01 a.m. get the 5d. if you like wide, the full frame will be a big benefit.
danny yee , december 30, 2006; 06:35 p.m. the one thing that really impressed me when i had a play with a friend's 5d was the viewfinder.
it is a crop factor only.
however have been used to 12mp files  from the fuji, although it was an interpolated 12mp, and the fujis - both s2  and s3 - made nicer colors.
being very uneducated on the 5d sensor, i went along with his request.
i have not been able to resolve this megapixel issue in my head i.e what is an acceptable minimum?
"that's the way it is".
p.m. hello all, i am in the market for a new pro camera - i currently do "pro" work with a nikon d70
when i purchased my first 35mm camera 26 years ago,  i realized a new brush.
available light photography in available, i.e., low, light is a pleasure with the canon  eos 5d because the typical lenses that you'd use with this camera include the  standard 50/1.4 from the film world.
i then went to a local camera store and had the sales person recreate a  backlit situation in store with the same results.
you can't be going into the bride and groom's face to lock in an exposure  reading.
per minute atleast 10 images or less??
its hard to find real photographers now as anyone with a  fairly good digital is now branding themselves as pro photographers......
i love the fact that the 5d has 12.8 megs of image boosting power but for difficult shoots i find myself using the 20d. i really think canon dropped the ball on this one.
my camera choices are: nikon d2x, nikon d200, canon 5d, canon 1ds mark ii (or wait for the new canon 1d mark iii (8mps)).
i started with the 300d, switched to the 20d and now have the 5d.
before digital, i had to pay to have the negatives developed and the  photos printed--the good ones and the bad ones!
if you dislike digital for some of the reasons vincent or i have brought up you can still use a digital camera like a film camera and make a decision to not use advanced digital editing or decide to not simply hold the trigger down and take thousands of photos at a location to get a few good ones.
i keep a small pocket-sized book with me with prints of my favorite photos.
images that would have been difficult to attain (or costly, using a pro lab) straight from camera to high street developer.
collect cans and shoot weddings with a popcan  pinhole array!
at least 3 of the first five pictures are having some exposure issues,  and the first one is obviously the worst.
they're 13mpx, that's to say near the state of the art for a  digital 35mm size-like camera.
but i need my lcd to show me exactly  what i'm getting.
i have been looking at the 5d as my primary and my 30d as my backup so  i won't be losing time changing lenses.
let the camera rest for a few minutes  and the battery voltage will come back.
yes, canon can do 14bit ad conversion, but if the pixel picks up only nosier data at first hand, more resolution in the ad stage simply won't help much - (amplifying the noise)?
asher . , april 14, 2007; 02:01 p.m.b&h, not amazon phil- not sure if pn has some backroom deal going with amazon, but by far the best mail order photography supplier isb&h photo: huge selection, iron-clad reputation, great prices, super fast shipping, and the best customer service i've ever experienced.
and i think there lies a fundamental principal.
concerning film versus digital: both have advantages, but it is mainly a very personal question.
the 5d especially is excellent with wide angle and fish eye lenses.
and the 50d with its big pixel count in a small  crop sensor and the full frame 5d mk ii are both more capable in their noise  reduction and in other ways.
digital, is insulting.
the primary advantages of having a digital sensor the same size (24x36mm)  as a frame of 35mm film are (1) higher image quality, especially in terms of  noise and especially in lower light situations, and (2) the ability to use very  wide angle lenses.
it has meant a  huge learning curve for me.
there is a woman who  does blurry monotypes from my digital wildlife photos and sells them for more  than i can sell the originals.
it's  in fact a scam!
also,  compared to film the quality wasn't even close!
i have not been able to resolve this  megapixel issue in my head i.e what is an acceptable minimum?
i believe that you have to approach digital completely differently to film.
there is a woman who does blurry monotypes from my digital wildlife photos and sells them for more than i can sell the originals.
i will have to get him into a darkroom.
it's the firlst camera with full frame  from this category of cameras.
incredible  photos, i have no more need for film.
for the most part i keep the original raw files and print the best of them.
ok...for a photojournalist, a sport phtographer, a reporter like for a "common user" a digital vs. film question simply makes no sense.
i went digital in 2001 on a trip to egypt to teach laboratory sciences and did not want to cart around several pounds of film together with all the other stuff i brought.
a.m. hi how do you leave the 5d on a tripod and use a self timer that lasts for  atleast an hour and shoot continously.
now, though not being a maniac of the very latest gadget, the possibility of a new 5d version makes me slow down my upgrade...
a good image is a good image whether it was shot on film, with digital, or hand drawn on the back of a stained bar coaster.
you may want to do what i'm going to do, buy it from a local retailer where you can inspect it first.
it also allows me a greater amount of control over the in camera exposure settings and my results are getting better all the time.
the camera  is always ready when you are.
in digital, you have to master the  craft of working with tools that are intangible, and exist in the realm of  mathematics (1's, and 0's).
instead of buying a wider lens i opted to go with a bigger frame 5d. best  regards.
i work mostly with available light so i have to have to  make sure i buy a camera that is best for low lighting conditions - i shoot  hotel interiors and exteriors as well as very high resolution virtual tours of  cockpits.
but i also love the grainless look of the digital.
and colin, if you hear anything more about the end of 5d production, please let us know.
it  doesn't matter whether you use film or digital.
by the same token, i cannot afford any of the more upmarket canon full  frame digitals.
i ended up using it like a (very  expensive!)point and shoot.
85mm  for portrait, 28 as wide angle, and selective dof/ unsharpness when i wish.
http://www.michaelclarkphoto.com/d2xreview.html david falk , april 06, 2007; 03:45
saying this though, your sigma lens should produce 17mm pictures without a problem.
there is no color settings to  adjust the lcd, you can only adjust the brightness levels.
whilst film reigns supreme in many people's opinions, others would argue  differently.
for the most part i keep the  original raw files and print the best of them.
so the only way to frame an image precisely is to take a test picture, look at the edges on the bright 2.5" rear lcd, and then recompose and click again.
and, that there are no plans for an  upgrade or the inevertable 3d.
i went digital in 2001 on a trip to egypt to teach laboratory  sciences and did not want to cart around several pounds of film together with  all the other stuff i brought.
like me, they have taken the time and effort to  understand, for example, what a colour space is and whether a device uses an  rgb or cymk model.
p.m. i have to agree totally with this review of the 5d. as one who has shot leica equipment for over 30 years, this was the system of choice for me when i decided to make the transition from my trusty leica r8's & leica lenses to the digital world of the 5d with ef-l lenses.
i'm saying your argument sounds like someone that hates  anything other than film and it just doesn't make any sense.
flash the canon eos 5d does not have a built-in flash.
all in all, the 5d has made me shoot things i would never have shot without it.
i just got everything in the mail today and i am experiencing major  vignetting from this lens.
i shot with a rebel xti and when i went to the full frame
my purpose buying it was to do architecture (50% of my assignements) with the 24 tse i already had on a eos 1n rs, amazing lens.
for that, you're in my debt.
also, compared to film the quality wasn't even close!
if you insist on having a wide-to-tele zoom, the standard choice is thecanon ef 24-70mm f/2.8l usm, (compare prices) (review ), which is useful for event photography such as wedding receptions.
it  really is hard to find a true proffessional photographer.
digicams will all turn to dust but the film cameras  of yesterday will be solid as a rock.
my  purpose buying it was to do architecture (50% of my assignements) with the 24  tse i already had on a eos 1n rs, amazing lens.
i thought i was going to get that and more when i bought my 5d. boy was i in for a surprise.
i know some of you are probably saying "use the histogram"!
sometimes readers, in their emotion, do not read  quite so carefully.
i'm torn on  buying the 5d. this dust thing seems to be an issue, vignetting due to light  not falling evenly on full frame sensors(apparently a big problem for canon  right now).
who cares if it is 3000 or even 10,000.
thanks, carlos henry h , june 22, 2010;
although the d70 would make a great backup camera.
microdrives work in the camera, but operate very slowly if you are taking 14 mb raw images.
i would like to return to the days of full frame picutures and hence the  5d appeals, even if the "motor drive" is limited to 3 fps.
some reviewers think that the 70-200mm f/4l is is a "better" lens (sharpness, etc) than the f/2.8l at the same apertures.
george slusher , august 23, 2008; 06:59 p.m. nice review.
it  is like a million times easier."
the canon 17mm-40mm f4 lens works beautifuly with the 5d and if you want the f2.8 then try the canon 24mm-70mm pro lens.
the picasa program from google also can understand the eos 5d's .cr2 raw files.
that's pretty sad, considering what a tour de force of  technology the 5d's sensor is.
and you will have spent a lot less than 3000 i guarantee.
it is hard to tell whether the dust problems began with amazon.com or are the result of poor quality control from canon.
quico álvarez , december 05, 2007; 06:03 a.m. hi, folks: i am professional, and like that it is not the same to spend $2,000 than  $7,000, so i think that my choice should be the eos-5d. the only thing that  stops me is not be able to know if this camera's a/d conversion is 12 or 14  bits.
a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
the best is the enemy of the good and is hard on the pandl.
the picasa program from google also  can understand the eos 5d's .cr2 raw files.
the 24-70/2.8l lens (mostly from the robinson r44): the  70-200/2.8l lens: bob atkins review of the eos 5d footnote: what happens when you hand the camera to someone else? one perceived problem with professional-grade cameras is that they can't  be used by novices.
arunas salkauskas , december 10, 2006; 02:09 a.m. "a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives  to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
because this is not a zoom lens, it has many fewer individual pieces of glass inside and therefore you'll get the highest possible contrast and image quality.
i  would say that if you have the money to spend on a canon 5d then definately try  to get proffesional canon lenses.
both  media have their weaknesses.
sensitivity is adjustable from iso 50-3200 but there is no good reminder of what you've got set and the setting is persistent if you turn the camera off and back on overnight.
i found  it very relaxing.
there is no magnification with the smaller sensor cameras.
it is maybe not a spectacular, but a very solid and high quality  camera that can give very good files.
i just wonder whether the 'dust magnet' issue will come back to haunt me further down the line.
shall we not suspend judgment until we have actually tried them?
the 5d has a green "idiot mode" on the left control dial.
in my humble opinion, it is not the equipment  or the media it is the art, the composition, inspiration and good light that  makes a good picture.
a little consideration more: the hasselblad h3d-22 (that's a heavy medium format bazooka) has a 4080x5440 square format sensor that produce a 22mpx file or, in print-size terms, a 13x18 print.
do i  need a xsi or a 5d?
the only problem for deciding for 5d is the price.
i would say that if you have the money to spend on a canon 5d then definately try to get proffesional canon lenses.
photo processing stores).
digital allows photographers to experiment and create images with the camera in a way that is much too expensive for most people to do with film.
ok, i had no plans to shelv my pentax k1000, and  even still had a desire to eventually convert an unused bathroom into a  darkroom.
the common error that philip greenspun's review push  forward is thinking that digital camera is the best solution for all or, in  another formulation, that digital camera are simply better than film ones.
just google the  name of the shop and reviews, like, in my case was: "bestpricecameras  reviews" so, it seems that the cheapest 40d (not scam) price was around $1000 and  the 5d around $2200.
the mid game is still years away.
the daunting nature of the processes involved in film would explain (along with relative cost) the explosion of new digital users.
the canon speedlite 580ex ii flash, (compare prices) (review) is canon's current top of the line and it usefully covers an angle as wide as a 14mm lens.
canon's wide zooms are good, but very far from the level of the nikon.
an  alternative is thecanon ef 24-105mm f/4 l is usm, (compare prices) (review),  which has the advantages of light weight and image-stabilization at the cost of  one f-stop in maximum aperture, which means that the viewfinder will be only  half as bright.
that's why 5d is such an amazing gear, will so is the nikon d3.

if you are a wide-angle junkie and have a bunch of older canon eos lenses  designed for film cameras, you'll love having the eos 5d.
the difference is that  you can shoot 5000 images in one day with out spending $7000 dollars on film  and carrying around a 100 pound duffle bag full of film.
there are certainly a lot of good nikon cameras, as shown by the reviews  at thislink for nikon products.
i know some of you  are probably saying "use the histogram"!
digital unlocks creative possibilities because you never have to worry about how many shots you have left (or how many you need to get the image you want).
is full frame visibly sharper to the viewer than 1.6 at usual viewing distances?
as a very late visitor to this page, long after the mk ii is out, and after  i have bought myself a nice used 5d, i have to say that the original review was  nice, but many of the comments above seem tome to be by people who  either haven't ever actually used the camera, or, at the least, have never read  the manual.
i do not choose a camera based solely on market  share, of course, but such data are not irrelevant to me.
the creative process is not  dependant on the tools.
the camera can capture 3 frames per second continuously.
does the 5d has it all or is there any solid rumour of upcoming good upgrades on it in the coming 6 month ?
for my purposes, though, resolution and low light performance aren't huge  issues, so my olympus e1 is actually better in other regards: much smaller and  lighter, weatherproofed, and better lenses (in my price range).
the light meter of both 5ds consistently  underexposed when faced with backlit situations.
i see the 5d more adequated for great prints with their big sensor allied with excelent characteristics.
but i'm still a little lost!
i can do in 15 minutes what used to take me all day in the dark room
a new lineup that is intended to attract a more... there are few industries as heart-wrenching as the fine art business.
and in  this time i have started selling images through stock agencies.
heck, the pentax k10d trounces the 40d due solely to its in body anti shake.
lol a bit of dust and air  pollution is not enough to name mexico a measure parameter for camera  resistance.
both media have their weaknesses.
just looking for some recommendations from who to buy from for the best price.
http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/tc-80n3.shtml,  http://www.usa.canon.com/html/cameras_slr/eos3acc.html michael brown , january 23, 2007; 12:55 a.m. vincent, that is the most ridiculous statement i have ever heard.
it is also  a good bit less expensive than the nikon d2xs.
i don't own many lenses - 10.5mm and the 18-70 that came with the d70.
--lannie shane phil , july 21, 2007; 01:13 a.m. lannie, thanks for your comments.
i had considered getting a 30d with the es-f 10-22mm zoom, which has been reported to be a great combination for landscape and architecture photography, but i'm not sure i like spending the money for a lens that will only work on the 30d and not the 1d or my canon film bodies.
there are a lot of good cameras out there from quite a number of manufacturers.
i  had considered getting a 30d with the es-f 10-22mm zoom, which has been  reported to be a great combination for landscape and architecture photography,
looking back over this entire thread, it is astonishing how emotional  people can get over film v. digital and canon v. nikon, etc.
you lose image stabilization, but gain one  f-stop in aperture so you can use higher shutter speeds and the viewfinder will  be brighter.
there are two control wheels so that you can adjust aperture and shutter speed simultaneously.
check out thomas hawk's photos  www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk which are never shot with a flash and he often  shoots in very lowlight at iso 1600.
i enjoyed making prints in my dark room i did pr, weddings, events, sports, newspaper work, portraits and even printed some in a couple of other peoples books.
the canon eos 5d cannot run on disposable aa batteries.
i have shot over 8000 images with  my 5d now and evey single one has rivaled the quality of scanned negatives shot  with my leica.
if i decide to switch to canon now is the time since i don't have too much nikon equipment.
find a extremely rare and sought after  collectors film camera and outfit it with the outstanding rare and obscure  sought after glass.
in a year or two, of course, it will be just one more good camera.
my canon eos 10 is still my favourite camera
they are  very fast for dslrs.
andrew klerck , may 12, 2007; 04:19 a.m. hey robert, well the 5d is a full frame sensor (like a film slr).
patty larue , october 28, 2010; 10:20 a.m. i have the canon 5d and have been using with the 70-200 heavy lens for portrait work and weddings can someone please tell me what other lens to buy to replace this heavy lens for every day before i have to have surgery my neck can not take it.
be smart, do the research.
i have won awards in art shows with digital pictures taken with a  canon d60 at 6.3 megapixels, printed on an i9900 printer at 13x19.
5d i noticed the vingetting.
aside from all my rambling though, the 5d is definately the best digital camera out there!
if you decide to go the photoshop/bridge route, you might find the dam
i enjoy shooting with my elan7, as well as my canon 5d. i have  noticed a big difference in image quality going from my xti to the 5d.
if you need high frames per second, i would not  recommend this camera.
so i'm hoping that i've found the best of both worlds.
i've also lost a lot of digital files  over the years, but i still have our old slides from the 1960's.
and we all know that good home cooking is best, but sometimes a quick takeaway  hits the spot as well.
i could buy the 1ds mark ii as a  backup (kidding!).
********************************************
any price that would fall more than, lets say, 20% or more out of that was proven to be a scam (in all cases).
if so, i would prefer to get by with the quality small sensor 40d.
tom h , october 18, 2006; 09:59 a.m. evita it might be true that if you don't have an eye for shooting  photographs a better camera will not change that.
as a very late visitor to this page, long after the mk ii is out, and after i have bought myself a nice used 5d, i have to say that the original review was nice, but many of the comments above seem tome to be by people who either haven't ever actually used the camera, or, at the least, have never read the manual.
the viewfinder image is substantially larger than on the small-sensor canon bodies.
there are remedies for this, similar to shooting 35mm film with a wide angle lens.
i have found some really good deals on medium format cameras.
highlights can burn out much easier and in the shadows the transition from very dark to real black can be quite sudden.
i also enjoy digital photography and have been able to support my hobby by creating portraits for people through digital art.
viewfinder viewfinder coverage on the canon eos 5d is standard for an advanced  amateur single-lens reflex camera, about 96 percent of what is recorded on the  sensor is displayed in the viewfinder.
antonio (italy) , october 13, 2006; 03:46 p.m. hi to all!
however have been used to 12mp files from the fuji, although it was an interpolated 12mp, and the fujis - both s2 and s3 - made nicer colors.
i'll be a die hard film fanatic as long as the good men and women at kodak keep cranking out the precious 35mms.
i'll be a die hard film fanatic as long as the good men and women at kodak keep  cranking out the precious 35mms.
this is particularly the case as i like to take a fair number of  wide angle - generally 25mm ( in 35 mm slr speak) to 35mm.
i would guess that the photographer (myself included) can take way more  pictures and cheaper than using film because digital pictures are all free  until processed.
robert ingram , may 11, 2007; 12:39 p.m. i just bought a canon 5d. apparently, the salesperson did not know what they were talking about, because he encouraged me to buy the canon 5d with the sigma dc 17-70 f/2.8 lens.
i have been using a 1d for the last 4 years.
a real photographer is the one who composes the  shot perfectly and with their knowledge and technical ability will be able to  capture a beautiful photo in 1 single shot rather than taking hundreds and  finding the best one.
it lacks a proper lcd display.
i don't see the  interpolated finepix megapixels exceed the canon.
here are some things that would be nice for the next version of the 5d: can you get a dramatically better photo with the eos 5d and a canon 50/1.4 compared to what you'd get withcanon digital rebel xti (black) and sigma 30mm f/1.4
it is my opinion that it is "cheating" to use some of the more advanced photoshop functions to manipulate your image because they allow you to create a "better" image than you originally captured.
as a matter of  fact, i print photos not posters most of the time.
i understand vincent's viewpoint but we all have different levels of purism.
01:56 p.m. definitely go for it!
to make a very long story short: both fuji and canon have their strengths, the canon with the right converter for raw (i prefer canons own one) can produce quite nice looking results, sharp, low noise etc.
at the moment i have the following canon lens: 24- 70 2.8l; 70 -200 /4l;  135/2l; 80/1.8 ,non l; 50/1.4.
so i got myself a 300d.
i have a friend that purchased a 40d. he likes the fps but wishes he had  purchased the 5d. if you have not used a 5d, perhaps you might borrow or rent  one and see if it suits you.
and i'm very happy about that.
the current relative  merits and weaknesses of both media have been well-detailed and seem almost  rhetorical now.
if the rumors are true and canon is  going to come out with a replacement to the 5d i might be interested in that as  well.
not unless you want to blow up the image to  poster size and then the 13 megapixels of the 5d will be dramatically sharper  than the 8 megapixels of the rebel.
shooting with film makes you think about so much more and makes you  get a grip on things that digital will never teach you.
nothing but giant prints or croping.
my comments have no impact whatsoever on the market image of either canon or nikon.
different ways to achieve what in principle, should be the same end, surely?
they are different mediums same as the way you would use either oils or  water colours.
there are no "winners" just have fun with what you like, and stop putting others down just to satisfy your own egomania.
image attachment: rasberry ripple !.jpg
but if you are smart and creative and artistic (and do not prefer to show this through computer illustration) but rather photography, shoot film.
any advice you have for me would be greatly appreciated.
thanks, sincerely, david beren patterson , march 12, 2007; 02:32 a.m. i'm hanging out for the 5d mark ii!
it is also interesting to look here if you want to get one indicator of relative market shares for the various companies, not just canon and nikon--and not just at the high end.
alan cukurs , october 28, 2007;
in very practical terms, that is, a 600mm lens will give results in terms of image size comparable to 900mm lens when used on a sensor approximately 2/3 the length and width of a full frame sensor.
film is more organic and like many examples of older  technology it will always have its place and use and class (i have a fine omega  mechanical wristwatch; sure it isn't as accurate as a quartz watch but it has  class).
the canon 17mm-40mm f4 lens works beautifuly  with the 5d and if you want the f2.8 then try the canon 24mm-70mm pro lens.
not unless you want to blow up the image to poster size and then the 13 megapixels of the 5d will be dramatically sharper than the 8 megapixels of the rebel.
i never considered film photographers artistic because all one was doing was pushing a button.
too  bad even my photos are great with this camera.
the "problem" with that image that you have [posted here is not the lens or the camera's problem...
it's  a six-car pileup at the intersection of art and commerce and the amount of  opinion and hyperbole that is somehow labeled as... dslrs in the movies: 'hellbent' the ten best action films of 2011 understanding dpi: the solution to resolution ready, set, go:
compared to nikon the full-frame canon eos 5d is cheaper than nikon's top-of-the-line  small-sensor body.
brian cincotta , february 02, 2007; 04:58 p.m. tom, you made a comment and you said: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."
i'm not saying one is  better than the other.
as for printing, guess what, i can print to slides from digital just as easy as printing on paper if i want to go wet.

andrew robertson , august 24, 2007; 02:32 a.m. come on, i see at least 2 or 3 nikons out of the 60 or so cameras in that  olympics shot.
who knows where digital will take us in the future?
unfortunately, i'm in the middle of a job and now will have to rely on my 1d to  finish it.
put another away, using a 100mm lens is going to give you an effective  focal length of [approximately] 150mm when used with the 10d, 20d, 30d, and  digital rebel series.
i have a quality range of l series glass and if i went down the full frame  path, would purchase couple of wide angle primes.
i perfectly understand all these older guys that shot film for years and  years all of a sudden going, "wow i can do this with this new thing and
digital has mainstreamed the amount of people that can produce an amazing  shot (by themselves, digital photography largely cuts out the middleman in  mainstream film, ie.
the difference is that you can shoot 5000 images in one day with out spending $7000 dollars on film and carrying around a 100 pound duffle bag full of film.
i'm very fond of wide lens photography and i wouldn't like  to lose my cheap 19-35mm :).
i would like to return to the days of full frame picutures and hence the 5d appeals, even if the "motor drive" is limited to 3 fps.
i do notice  that sales are going up and higher resolution, better colours, less distortion  etc. is not the last reason for that :) and don't forget glass.
--lannie shane phil , july 19, 2007; 12:46 a.m. i have tried both canon and nikon systems, and here is my 2 cents worth:  canon is an excellent system if you have the time and patience to play around  with its settings, especially the iso which is not automatic.
so, i hope he really did have the inside info, and that a canon "5d ii" is on the way.
imagine all the gold coins and  shillings you would collect!
i'm no big fan of nikon, i just like the cameras  they make.
i perfectly understand all these older guys that shot film for years and years all of a sudden going, "wow i can do this with this new thing and it is like a million times easier."
in addition, the build quality of nikon cameras is legendary.
i don't really mind if their isn't a significant increase in resolution, but i would love to see the dust reduction system and the 3" lcd off the 1d mark iii.
i thought i was going to get that and more  when i bought my 5d. boy was i in for a surprise.
is there a view that the 5d is just the first full frame pro-sumer digital that will soon be replaced by canon?
owning a 30d with satisfies me quite well, i must say that i miss the perspectives of the full frame, 5d is definitely the choice for me.
if you insist on having a wide-to-tele zoom,  the standard choice is thecanon ef 24-70mm f/2.8l usm, (compare prices) (review ), which is useful for event photography such as wedding receptions.
it is the first in what olympus is calling it's om-d line of micro four thirds bodies.
i do not know about the engineering but i seem to get  much better pictures in low light situations with the fullframe.
i had own my own photo business which i closed about  the time i converted to digital in 2003.
if you take 100 pictures in quick succession, don't be alarmed when the  "low battery" symbols flashes.
the original 5d is looking rather outdated.
the noise just looks like a bad quality image to me it doesn't give the atmosphere or mood that film grain does.
it always fascinates me, just how much passion can be  stirred up by the discussion of an artistic tool, in this case, the 5d. i guess  painters must debate paintbrush issues as hotly on their forums??
want to really do something?
i found two shops that sell the 5d for $849 and the 400d for $339 which is incredibly cheap.
both richer and more pleasing, and more "film  like".
he said i should hold off buying it,  because that the next upgrade to the 5d was going to be announced pretty soon,
clients get nervous and models get bored and lose interest, you have to capture the moment or you'll lose the momentum.
my oldest son it taking a photography class, and i found out to my dismay, it is a digital photography class.
compared to th 300d the 5d gives me quality prints close enough to film.
if i shoot at iso 100 or 200 with a longer shutter speed will i notice as  much noise?
i loved  shooting in film for sooo long, but even the negs of the pictures i took are  just sitting up in a box somewhere.
if you are a wide-angle junkie and have a bunch of older canon eos lenses designed for film cameras, you'll love having the eos 5d.
there was one less mis-interpretation of the colour of the original.
so, your max print size will be a great...9,4x14.
i use photoshop and shoot raw.
plus, you can take more...many more of them and print or save only the good photos.
the canon always looks to me like reduced, i guess it is the color  palette, or the cmos sensors.
either  way, i have found the driving factor for great image quality is the glass,  namely l-glass.
being very uneducated on the 5d sensor, i went along  with his request.
regards, bernie jonathan farmer , april 06, 2007; 10:51 a.m. thanks guys for your advice.
welcome to photo.net:
but much more important than  resouloution is the amount of contrast that you can record.
as far as i am concerned, if you are trying to make what you do take less time and be more efficient, then perhaps you should rethink what it is you are doing.
i have the 100mm f/2 just for that first instance, where 2 stops can make a big difference in stopping the motion of a galloping horse.
but i need my lcd to show me exactly what i'm getting.
i enjoy film and still purchase film equipment.
a recent review of a top photo printer (and by that i mean one costing over 500 pounds sterling, rather than in the 200 pounds sterling price range) by someone experienced in both digital and darkroom techniques, said that it produced the best prints he had ever seen, including those from a traditional darkroom.
meanwhile it is instructive to look at the posts above if only to note  that the predictions and rumours in them are all entirely wrong.
that is a rough rounded-off number and a rough way of getting the point across, but it works as very good shorthand in practice when deciding on a lens--and when writing reviews for a general audience.
as evita m put it so concisely, the real magic lies with the person taking the photograph.. and frequently, the luck of catching a passing moment as it happens.. whether a facial expression or the momentous interplay of light and landscape.
(it turns out this is not a  problem.
it is also a good bit less expensive than the nikon d2xs.
camera is just great, but for the tse system... http://www.jb-avril.com tony (anthony) rowell , july 08, 2006;
but then i got so many projects going using the "dry" darkroom in my computer.
i gave a huge sigh of relief when finally getting a digital slr - i could skip a generation in the process of getting digital prints.
i love my canon digital rebel!
they are different mediums same as the way you would use either oils or water colours.
i still have my old pentax and it is  loaded, but i don't know when i'll find the time to take it off the shelf and  finish the roll.
now that we are at this point, give me a linhof super  technika only it is an 8x10 and a mountain of 8x10 polaroid film and a  processor.
it certainly depends on the person using the camera and i believe  that you need to have the flare and artistic ability to be able to use any  camera (including digital) to produce beautiful images.
its almost a non-comparison.
we have millions of average joe's with an $800 dslr that can produce great quality artistic photos.....and that will obviously blow the ego of anyone who's labored in a darkroom for any amount of time.
i for one regret immensely never being schooled  in film, however there is so much to learn in digital as well.
without reading the manual, you can  go into the custom function menu and the camera to lock up the mirror before  taking a picture (then set self-timer mode on the drive button and the camera  automatically configures itself for a 2-second self-timer delay; press the  button and the mirror locks up, then the shutter opens two seconds later).
so  you did a million weddings and a zillion portraits?
an alternative is thecanon ef 24-105mm f/4 l is usm, (compare prices) (review), which has the advantages of light weight and image-stabilization at the cost of one f-stop in maximum aperture, which means that the viewfinder will be only half as bright.
the "problem" with that image that you have [posted here is not  the lens or the camera's problem...
compared to any of the smaller sensor dslrs i've used - and certainly the 350d and various olympus cameras - it's huge.
digital allows  photographers to experiment and create images with the camera in a way that is  much too expensive for most people to do with film.
not enough people have the  resources to set up a full b&w/color photo lab to be able to manipulate  photo's on the required level of "fine art".
do you want to be a photographic machine?
it really is a great camera for what i do, mainly portraiture and some landscape.
so you did a million weddings and a zillion portraits?
i gave a huge sigh  of relief when finally getting a digital slr - i could skip a generation in the  process of getting digital prints.
p.m. the film vs. digital is such a worn out debate.
however, whilst there are many happy-snappers  out there, who go from low resolution jpeg straight to printer, without so much  as a mention of photoshop or the like, there are also photographers, amateur  and professional, who are increasingly learning to understand and use the  digital medium to great effect.
(the actual conversion factor is going to be about 1.6 for the canon small sensors, and about 1.5 for the nikon sensors, but 1.5 is close enough to be useful in practice for all of them.)
all this competition is really going to benefit everybody here.
unfortunately that  particular lens with 5d seems to produce an elliptical unexpected distortion.
someone  commented on how digital is almost catching film resolution or something.
i've suddenly  rediscovered my love of photography.
the small sensor canon bodies turn an exciting 20mm wide angle lens into a boring 30mm perspective.
book: digital asset management for photographers (peter krogh; o'reilly 2005)  helpful.
if you dislike digital for some of the reasons vincent or i have  brought up you can still use a digital camera like a film camera and make a  decision to not use advanced digital editing or decide to not simply hold the  trigger down and take thousands of photos at a location to get a few good ones.
there are certainly a lot of good nikon cameras, as shown by the reviews at thislink for nikon products.
i wonder how many photographers have never gone to the trouble  and expense of having their own darkroom, but in recent years have successfully  used their computer to shape and knock out great images from their digital  camera?
what  you see is what you get.
(it turns out this is not a problem.
i have covered a summarised review on my website: http://digital_camera_reviews.protechltd.com folarin s , february 05, 2009; 09:00 p.m. as a new member on photo.net,i have to say that many of the above views relating to the respective merits of film vs. digital and full frame vs 1.6 crop factor have been tremendously helpful.
i typically am not shooting high speed photography so the 3 fps works well.
whilst film reigns supreme in many people's opinions, others would argue differently.
03:13 a.m. i started out with pen and ink, moved to pastels, charcoal, watercolor  airbrushing.
i can readily purchase a quality 40d, but to me that is not going forward.
but canon doesn't communicate  at all on problems with this particular lens and generally says it efficient in  all situations.
i shoot glamour and getting those warm glowing  skintones is paramount.
i've done both, and personally, digital allows me sooo much more access to  my photos.
nothing  like objectivity. .
i want to be able to deliver to my client larger prints with little or no noise in shadow areas.
needless to say i am still using my 20d for demanding shoots, but i am  considering a 1d mark iii or a 1ds mark ii.
as for the 5d, yes, i believe that it has been worth the hype, in spite of its limitations in terms of speed.
and i'm very happy about  that.
why would i spend extra money on development and enlargement on a photo that cannot even be manipulated on basic levels that is such commonplace in digital photography today?
in film, someone pains in a dark room for hours, using tangible tools that move  and change light as its placed onto a print.
for me, the  argument in favour of digital is all about time, practicality and  accessibility.
my only  recourse is to purchase from a local dealer where i can inspect the camera  before i buy it to make sure there is no dust in the viewfinder.
quico álvarez , december 05, 2007; 06:03 a.m. hi, folks: i am professional, and like that it is not the same to spend $2,000 than $7,000, so i think that my choice should be the eos-5d. the only thing that stops me is not be able to know if this camera's a/d conversion is 12 or 14 bits.
so, my  procedure was the following: 1.
there is a pc  connector on the side for studio strobes.
i enjoy shooting with my elan7, as well as my canon 5d. i have noticed a big difference in image quality going from my xti to the 5d. either way, i have found the driving factor for great image quality is the glass, namely l-glass.
it does just about  everything that an $7000 eos 1ds body from 2004 did at about half the weight (2  lbs).
i am assuming this lens is not designed for the 5d. could someone with more knowledge on this issue please expound?
robert sault , january 31, 2008; 08:06 p.m. i just talked to canon on the phone today, and they have no plans for a makeover of the 5d, it will possibly be the 7d in q3/q4 of 08.
operation is modeless.
canon is a massive company with the $billions to invest in building  semiconductor fabrication lines.
the best digital camera available.?
weather proofing, d o f button on the left(i hate it here, total pain to use with your thumb) i just wish that one camera would do all i want, the closest is the 1d mk3.
so the only way to frame an image precisely is to take a  test picture, look at the edges on the bright 2.5" rear lcd, and then  recompose and click again.
anyone know anymore about when this will happen?
shall we not use them?
has anyone else heared of this?
after much review, i am purchasing the 5d. i think it will be a wonderful brush to paint with.
it's the firlst camera with full frame from this category of cameras.
the 70-200mm f/4l is a lot cheaper (the f/4l is is cheaper than the non-is f/2.8l) and a lot lighter (the f/4l is is about half the weight of the f/2.8l is).
i'm in the market for a 5d and wouldn't mind waiting if i knew what the feature set would be.
anyone know  anymore about when this will happen?
i think i  will prbably not upgrade to the canon 5d mk ii as it is too expensive but will  wait for the next eolution to appear.
it's just seems ironic to me that a  $3000-2500 camera doesn't have a lcd screen as good as my $500 point and shoot.
so far as this is concerned, given the very diffucult engineering required  to produce a high quality wide angle zoom, i would prefer to purchase wide  angle prime lens :
colin carron , october 03, 2008; 05:16 a.m. now that the canon 5d mk ii has appeared (september 2008)
i make all kind of pictures, from sport to landscape and i am planning to buy the 40 d. however i am very tempted by the 5d. i have 3 lenses all l ones.
i wonder how many photographers have never gone to the trouble and expense of having their own darkroom, but in recent years have successfully used their computer to shape and knock out great images from their digital camera?
images that would have been difficult to attain (or costly, using a pro  lab) straight from camera to high street developer.
artistic film, and artistic digital photography are two different beasts.
sure, i could  build a great vintage camera for much less money than a 5d, but i'd spend more  on film, paper, chemicals and processing in 1 month than i would on a good  digital camera.
to be perfectly honest, if you were a person that was extremely well  versed in the digital tools, your ability to manipulate a photograph for  artistic purposes is, and to "tweak" a photograph is so much greater  than that if film.
i'm saying your argument sounds like someone that hates anything other than film
it is disappointing to see the lack of film photography being taught.
i want to be able to deliver to my client larger prints with little or no  noise in shadow areas.
a good photograph on  a slide is still better resolution than most digital cameras (perhaps all), but  if you scan it - you're re-sampling data, and that will cost you, and you might  be better off with having taken the original with a digital camera.
in all seriousness, nikon has been lagging behind canon for years now,  especially when it comes to long lenses and of course full frame digital.
radek hensler , june 14, 2007; 02:01 p.m.
digital pictures are different but damn, some of  them are of wonderful color and quality.
and what can you do with 13mp?
nikon is a versatile system if you are on the street and every moment counts.
again, i am no expert
and traditional  slides still have more of both, resoloution and contrast.
i have come to really enjoy photogarphy as an artform.
and they are the  present and the future of photography, i know that
at least 3 of the first five pictures are having some exposure issues, and the first one is obviously the worst.
whatever lens you get, you will be able to shoot at the correct focal length as opposed to the previous models (20d, 30d etc) which were x1.6 or thereabouts.
i only shoot in digital and believe my photography is beauty which i have created and cherish the percentage of the shots which are excellent.
" it's important to remember that even if you can scan something at a million dots per inch - you may just be fooling yourself.
a photographer has to be more skilled to use film than digital.
i have the 100mm f/2 just for that first instance, where 2 stops  can make a big difference in stopping the motion of a galloping horse.
i have read that nikon produce better color and resolution and that many  people are sold more on the amount of megapixles than anything else, please see  the link below.

the difference between film and digital isn't that any rich moron can take great pictures with a $7000 camera (they can't).
its just my personal opinion just like  anyone else's on this site.
it's a six-car pileup at the intersection of art and commerce and the amount of opinion and hyperbole that is somehow labeled as... by philip greenspun, september 2006 (updated february 2011)
about the only reason i can see to ante up the extra money and haul around the added weight of the 70-200mm f/2.8l would be if one routinely takes action pictures in low light or if one is obsessively enamored of blurry backgrounds.
you've successfully driven the price of a eos 3 down to a paltry $248.50 on ebay.
but if you are smart and creative and artistic (and do not  prefer to show this through computer illustration) but rather photography,  shoot film.
i do, however, use l lenses which i think more important than a couple of megapixels.
the learning curve is real and no less valid than that of  understanding film and darkroom techniques.
i am thinking about a 5d, but frankly i shoot wildlife on the wing that shows well and once in a while sells with the 6.3 i have.
add some fantastic filters (which digital users throw away  now) and accessories and you will be taking phenominal pictures no matter what.
what about film  cameras?
i just can't seem to get a saturated look on the lcd and it causes frustration during the shoot.
i just wish that one camera would do all i want,  the closest is the 1d mk3.
i must say that the 5d's image quality is great.
if you've pressed the playback button and are  reviewing images, a quick touch of the shutter release readies the camera to  take pictures again.
get the lcd and autofocusing right!
that is a rough rounded-off number and a rough way of  getting the point across, but it works as very good shorthand in practice when  deciding on a lens--and when writing reviews for a general audience.
thanks for the helpfull post.
each camera had dust in the viewfinder and on the imaging sensor,  the second body also had a problem (i thought) with the image numbering system,  showing them as _mg_0001 rather than img_0001.
ranging from $2500-3500.
i've had this eos 5d for nearly a year and it has survived a trip through mexico and being vibrated for two cross-country helicopter trips.

the bigger the film the better!
i shoot mostly landscapes, some architectural and event photography, so  the full frame is desired.

andrew robertson , august 24, 2007; 02:32 a.m. come on, i see at least 2 or 3 nikons out of the 60 or so cameras in that olympics shot.
i'll have to bring (perhaps even legally) that case to their  marketting dpt as 3000 euros is quiet an investement, even for a professional.
canon 5d or 1d are beautiful  cameras
the viewfinder image is substantially larger than on the small-sensor  canon bodies.

there is a greenish hue to  everything, which is unnerving when you are under the gun on a paid shoot.
the small sensor  canon bodies turn an exciting 20mm wide angle lens into a boring 30mm  perspective.
but i'm not sure i like spending the money for a lens that will only work on  the 30d and not the 1d or my canon film bodies.
i bought the digirebel (body only) 18 mos ago and this camera paid for itself immediately because i used to spend-at a minimum-at least $100 per month in film and developing.
in all it's been a hell of a workhorse camera for me, producing consistently high quality images even under adverse conditions.
perhaps i don't keep up as well as when i had the business.
beyond the canon ef 50mm f/1.4
i've seen some great stuff from my students using  pin-hole cameras.

so, i hope he really did have the inside info, and  that a canon "5d ii" is on the way.

zhero.net jonathan farmer , march 22, 2007; 01:31 p.m. can anyone give a honest opinion on how the 5d, d2xs and the finepix s5  compare with respect to image quality.
i shot with a rebel xti and when i went to the full frame 5d
it is hard to tell whether the dust problems began with amazon.com or are the  result of poor quality control from canon.
photography in available, i.e., low, light is a pleasure with the canon eos 5d because the typical lenses that you'd use with this camera include the standard 50/1.4 from the film world.
i am afraid that the answer is the first one, because canon don't say  anything about it in the "specs", anouncing it proudly when they  explain the advantages of the new brand eos-1ds mark iii.
one thing to note which i think is common to wide angle lenses, especially cheap lenses, is the light fall off or vignetting around the edges.
someone commented on how digital is almost catching film resolution or something.
when you are deciding  on which lens designed for 24 x 36 should be used with a camera having a sensor  2/3 the length and width of that, you can use the multiplicative inverse of  2/3, which is 1.5, and thereby compute what the effective focal length will be  as it affects magnification, i.e., image size.
i've found the review quite irritating for more or less the same  reasons that vincent martin wrote about -despite
dedicated canon accessory  flash units mount in the hot shoe above the viewfinder and the camera is able  to control flash exposure via a through-the-lens sensor.
i do,  however, use l lenses which i think more important than a couple of megapixels.
get the lcd and  autofocusing right!
robert ingram , may 11, 2007; 12:39 p.m. i just bought a canon 5d. apparently, the salesperson did not know what  they were talking about, because he encouraged me to buy the canon 5d with the  sigma dc 17-70 f/2.8 lens.
i am having so much fun with it!
if you decide to go the photoshop/bridge route, you might find the dam book: digital asset management for photographers (peter krogh; o'reilly 2005) helpful.
if you are a workhorse photographer, that is you are commercial, then you have things like time and money to worry about, and you need to find the best and most efficient and inexpensive tool for the job.
i shoot mostly landscapes, some architectural and event photography, so the full frame is desired.
but i am learning and starting to get results.
i think  the true test of a photographer is attempting to take the same quality images  with a film camera, as you can create using a digital camera with hours of  photoshop work afterwards.
they are now approaching what i use to produce with my film camera.
and i think  there lies a fundamental principal.
i've got two extra batteries so i may bring them along, although i'm all but certain no one will let me take a photo to test the sensor.
also i use the 24mm ts-e shift lens a lot for architecture, which would be  impossible with any nikon or fuji camera.
in all things artistic it  is the message not the media which is important.
i got mine used for $1000!
i am sure you will enjoy your eos3.
well, i love the 5d camera, but to dismiss nikon as a small company with clever optical engineers is, well, way, way off.
they are now approaching what i use to produce  with my film camera.
when i got my 5d things changed, there are no 'cheat' modes on this  camera, you actually have to know what you are doing.
to be perfectly honest, if you were a person that was extremely well versed in the digital tools, your ability to manipulate a photograph for artistic purposes is, and to "tweak" a photograph is so much greater than that if film.
brian cincotta , february 02, 2007; 04:58 p.m. tom, you made a comment and you said: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever  did with film."
but somehow, after a few drinks that tasted wierd but have a tequila like effect, i figured that they have some kind of machines were i could use a plastic card to get money out of it.
i don't really mind if their isn't a  significant increase in resolution, but i would love to see the dust reduction  system and the 3" lcd off the 1d mark iii.
it's "almost" like the canon 1ds mark ii at a much lower price so for me it"s grate really
in other words an image captured with the camera held vertically will appear on a computer screen in a vertical orientation.
in digital, you have to master the craft of working with tools that are intangible, and exist in the realm of mathematics (1's, and 0's).
some  artists work with a knife and others with a fine brush.
this sounds great and indeed would be  great on a film camera where slide mounts and cropping during enlargement often  result in the sacrifice of some of the image at the edges.
one thing to note which i think is common to wide  angle lenses, especially cheap lenses, is the light fall off or vignetting  around the edges.
i never considered film photographers artistic because all one was  doing was pushing a button.
whatever  lens you get, you will be able to shoot at the correct focal length as opposed  to the previous models (20d, 30d etc) which were x1.6 or thereabouts.
for some people, the film v digital argument is relevant and will legitimately continue for a long time.
brandon boghosian , april 05, 2008; 11:09 p.m. i'd like to thank everyone out there buying canon 5d's and other dslr's.
do not complain about high digicam prices.
shooting with film makes you think about so much more and makes you get a grip on things that digital will never teach you.
that is a bold statement, but having bought the very same  printer myself and seeing the results from images taken with my 5d, i can  understand his claim.
it's always  good to hear people getting good cameras for a good price.
the is will help with camera shake more than the extra stop will for the same money.
http://www.michaelclarkphoto.com/d2xreview.html regards jonathan david falk , april 06, 2007; 03:45 p.m. anyone know when canon will be updating the 5d?
so, please tell me that canon did some progress in this case in 5d best regards radek buck lovell , july 13, 2007; 05:44 p.m. philip greenspuns very ignorant statement in his review "the small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses" bring into question his entire review.
compared to the more expensive canon bodies if you have $7000 to spend, a strong back to carry the weight, and a quick  mind to take in the many displays and complex user interface, the eos 1ds mark  ii might be better than the 5d. the canon eos 5d, however, will do most professional jobs.
i have so much control over my images, it scares me.
it really is hard to find a true proffessional photographer.
arguing that shooting film is a more creative process  than shooting digital is like saying writing a novel with a pen and ink is more  creative than using a typewriter or computer.
one nit: the 100mm f/2 is not the only alternative to the 70-200mm f/2.8l.
as soon as you scan a negative to digital in order to make an enlargement, you are losing quality, no matter how good the scanner is.
i really enjoyed being in the darkroom.
but then i got so many projects going using the "dry"  darkroom in my computer.
what about film cameras?
so, given the fact that the 5d is  so cheap, should i buy that one instead given the facts that i presented to you?
canon 5d or 1d are beautiful cameras but i think film camera are still useful today.
the remark is also extremely snobbish.
so far there is no firmware update to  correct this.
no, nikon cannot match canon's sensor technology;they are not the electronics giant that canon is.
even af from basic minolta worked better than mine.
they are simply different.
well, everyone says it's a perfect camera, but...
put another away, using a 100mm lens is going to give you an effective focal length of [approximately] 150mm when used with the 10d, 20d, 30d, and digital rebel series.
that's pretty good market share for grandpa's camera brand!
p.m. education bldg albany ny combining the 5d's high iso cleanliness + is provides hand held  capabilities previously unheard of erwin baeyens , august 13, 2007; 10:54 a.m. frankly for being such a fantastic camera and for philip being an  experienced photographer there are some seriously over exposed pictures on this  review.
usm, (compare prices) (review), which is essential for day-to-day and low light photography, you will probably want the following standard professional zoom lenses: mercifully, canon does not include a cheap zoom lens as part of a "kit" with the eos 5d.
so it is not so professional as pretended.
digital pictures are different but damn, some of them are of wonderful color and quality.
what about autofocus in 5d. i've heard lot complaints from those who used nikon d200 and switched to canon 5d. after this they appreciate af they used to have in nikon.
canon's eos 5d has the standard four exposure modes: metered manual, aperture-priority, shutter-priority, and program autoexposure.
tom http://www.thomasdmoore.com dick arnold , january 28, 2007; 09:38
so a total of 3 5ds and all of them underexposed with backlighting.
who cares if it is 3000 or  even 10,000.
so, your max print size will  be a great...9,4x14.
compared to any of the smaller sensor dslrs i've used - and  certainly the 350d and various olympus cameras - it's huge.
ofcourse the brand has no impact on the photos you make, and neither does it make you a better photographer than you are.
even tried my hand  at oil.
at the 10k  range, the benefit of mf is obvious, the single pixel size (pitch) is much  larger (8.4um) than the 1ds mkiii's 6.4um.
are you ever actually going to look at any of those pictures again?
a good camera without the right glass is useless too tom antonio (italy) , october 18, 2006; 05:49 p.m. i apologize for bad english grammar in my previous post... pedro p. polakoff iii , october 22, 2006; 03:24
unfortunately, i'm in the middle of a job and now will have to rely on my 1d to finish it.
the sensor plane is closer to the front of the camera with the smaller sensor cameras, nothing else.
however i like to use lenses as with film cameras: no crop factor.
and i am fine with 3-5 fps, as i am, like most people out there, not a sport event shooter (5fps will do the job well, though).
the 5d is a spectacular body.
as soon as you scan a negative to digital in order to make an enlargement,  you are losing quality, no matter how good the scanner is.
joao pedro jorge , january 13, 2008; 02:36 p.m. i've been reading reviews on the 5d and the 40d because i'm thinking of  buying a new camera.
why can't canon create a metering system like nikon's color 3d matrix metering?
i think all we have seen thus far in the dslr game is not even the entire opening, to use a chess term.
in the digital world, however, what you capture in the camera is what you'll be delivering in a jpeg file, unless you go into a photo editing program and take the trouble to crop.
difficult to recreat with 35 mm, large format, or even  digital cameras.
but try that little experiment: you took some photos with your brand new 2,799usd canon5d, some are truly artistic masterpieces and you want to print them.
they hold thier value beautifully.
this is a photo of pro photographers using predominantly eos systems at the  olympics in 2004, a very demanding situation where "every moment  counts" (your phrase).
there is a diopter adjustment and you can change the focusing screen as well.
the only thing that worked was when the  salesman used spot metering on the subject's face by going up in his face to  lock in the exposure.
you may still be able to find the canon eos 5d, (compare prices), available from one of our partners.
canon is a massive company with the $billions to invest in building semiconductor fabrication lines.
a good photograph on a slide is still better resolution than most digital cameras (perhaps all), but if you scan it - you're re-sampling data, and that will cost you, and you might be better off with having taken the original with a digital camera.
i'm torn on buying the 5d. this dust thing seems to be an issue, vignetting due to light not falling evenly on full frame sensors(apparently a big problem for canon right now).
so a total of 3 5ds and all  of them underexposed with backlighting.
i don't recommend using it.
obviously there is nothing better to them than full-frame sensor in 5d but how really bad is with autofocus in 5d?
the 5d has a green "idiot mode" on the left  control dial.
all canonusa could do for me was apologize and take down my information.
zoe hellar , january 01, 2009; 03:51 a.m.
the 5d especially  is excellent with wide angle and fish eye lenses.
you can't keep adjusting your lights and changing your settings.
too bad even my photos are great with this camera.
it certainly depends on the person using the camera and i believe that you need to have the flare and artistic ability to be able to use any camera (including digital) to produce beautiful images.
if it is not going to be printed  bigger than 8x10 or if it is for web use then virtually every digital becomes  the same whether it is $150 or $3000.
the 5d does not shoot at the blazing speeds  of the newest canon dslr, but at present neither nikon nor anyone else has a  digital camera with the kind of speed the 1d mark iii does.
p.m. i am not an expert.
i could buy the 1ds mark ii as a backup (kidding!).
so for many looking for a full frame caera a used 5d may well still be a good buy.
that is a bold statement, but having bought the very same printer myself and seeing the results from images taken with my 5d, i can understand his claim.
george carter , december 16, 2006; 03:19 p.m. i bought my first dslr a canon 30d about 6 months ago and have been well  pleased.
as a matter of fact, i print photos not posters most of the time.
each camera had dust in the viewfinder and on the imaging sensor, the second body also had a problem (i thought) with the image numbering system, showing them as _mg_0001 rather than img_0001.
philippe poussier , may 09, 2007; 11:27 a.m. thanks for the review first.
(the  actual conversion factor is going to be about 1.6 for the canon small sensors,  and about 1.5 for the nikon sensors, but 1.5 is close enough to be useful in  practice for all of them.)
tom h , october 18, 2006; 09:59 a.m. evita it might be true that if you don't have an eye for shooting photographs a better camera will not change that.
i used bronicas and a number of canon  bodies and lenses.
a cheaper alternative but still good is the tamron range of lenses and they go down to f2.8 aswell for a fairly wide angled lens.
there is a pc connector on the side for studio strobes.
i currently own a 20d and prior to purchasing it had actually never used a "real" film camera (don't laugh but the only camera i had used was a single use disposable film camera).
it's "almost" like the canon 1ds mark ii at a much lower  price so for me it"s grate really
the primary advantages of having a digital sensor the same size (24x36mm) as a frame of 35mm film are (1) higher image quality, especially in terms of noise and especially in lower light situations, and (2) the ability to use very wide angle lenses.
i use the 645 lenses on the 5d with a  mirex adapter (shift comes in handy, since i do a lot of architecture).
it's always good to hear people getting good cameras for a good price.
in a year or two, of course, it  will be just one more good camera.
digital has made it too easy for anyone to get into photography (i'm not saying this is a bad thing!).
sure, i know it's a lot bigger than than the 20d and i've read all the who-ha of people praising it
just looking for some  recommendations from who to buy from for the best price.
if  you're considering purchasing this camera from an online retailer, buyer  beware.
it makes an image that goes into the computer nice n easy.
it needs to be supported with acceptable, not super, equipment.
only canon builds dslr with full  frame sensor right now.
it is more than good enough for most professional photojournalism applications, but still simple enough that a yuppie can get one to throw in the glovebox of his bmw suv and take pictures at the school soccer game.
you will have more fun.
the lcd is saturated and colors pop.
i've only used the camera for a brief moment.
ok, i had no plans to shelv my pentax k1000, and even still had a desire to eventually convert an unused bathroom into a darkroom.
with the 5d, what you got with your 20mm lens on the film camera  is what you get with the 5d. the canon eos 5d is compact and plasticky, but solidly built.
i think all we have seen thus far in the dslr game is not even the entire  opening, to use a chess term.
in all things artistic it is the message not the media which is important.
now, if digital only had the same effect on  good canon glass...... alan cukurs , april 17, 2008; 01:42 a.m.
autofocus performance is superb, even in dim light, with 15 af sensors distributed around the frame.
the learning curve is real and no less valid than that of understanding film and darkroom techniques.
i've suddenly rediscovered my love of photography.
note that, as with most digital  single lens reflex cameras, the 5d cannot provide you with a preview in the  rear lcd because the sensor is occluded by the viewing mirror until you press  the shutter release.
you are not asking the design  engineers to overcome significant and difficult design compromises by desiging  "one wide angle zoom that suits all" etc.
after that i've found so many scams like that one that i recommend everyone doing the same before they buy their camera online.
the 5d does not shoot at the blazing speeds of the newest canon dslr, but at present neither nikon nor anyone else has a digital camera with the kind of speed the 1d mark iii does.
digital has mainstreamed the amount of people that can produce an amazing shot (by themselves, digital photography largely cuts out the middleman in mainstream film, ie.
now that we are at this point, give me a linhof super technika only it is an 8x10 and a mountain of 8x10 polaroid film and a processor.
however i know that doing a wedding or journalism is so much simpler with  digital.
weather proofing, d o f button on the left(i hate it here, total  pain to use with your thumb)
my camera choices are: nikon d2x, nikon d200, canon 5d, canon 1ds mark ii  (or wait for the new canon 1d mark iii (8mps)).
i'm in the market for a 5d and wouldn't mind  waiting if i knew what the feature set would be.
if i shoot at iso 100 or 200 with a longer shutter speed will i notice as much noise?
but it is now in need of repair :-(
autofocus performance is superb, even in dim light,  with 15 af sensors distributed around the frame.
the canon 5d mark 2 has generally been given rave reiviews and has be  tagged as the wedding photographers camera of choice.
because this is not a zoom lens, it has many  fewer individual pieces of glass inside and therefore you'll get the highest  possible contrast and image quality.
if you are on the street and would like a  dependable camera that understands you...go nikon.
i almost lost it in a pawnshop in las vegas after i ran out of money!
landrum kelly , july 19, 2007; 09:10 a.m. go nikon!
the canon eos 5d has been replaced by the canon eos 5d mark ii, (compare prices) (review), and it might be more worth your money to purchase the current version.
from where you stay it's normal to have  perspective because the viewpoint where you are when taking that photo is lower  not perfectly "perpendicular" and also in the middle of the buildyng  (sorry my english, i'm not a native...)
i currently own a 20d and prior to purchasing it had actually never used a  "real" film camera (don't laugh but the only camera i had used was a  single use disposable film camera).
compared to th 300d  the 5d gives me quality prints close enough to film.
also i use the 24mm ts-e shift lens a lot for architecture, which would be impossible with any nikon or fuji camera.

i have won awards in art shows with digital pictures taken with a canon d60 at 6.3 megapixels, printed on an i9900 printer at 13x19.
i keep a small pocket-sized book  with me with prints of my favorite photos.
both richer and more pleasing, and more "film like".
the  best digital camera available.?
i do like the fact that it does have the 35mm size sensors  and that it is built so similar to the 30d. i have been price checking and find  several hundred dollars variation in prices.
jeremey barrett , may 18, 2007; 12:22 a.m. robert (ingram), the sigma dc 17-70 is designed for aps-c sized sensors,  not full frame sensors like the 5d. the salesperson should absolutely have  known that and they should take it back, it simply won't produce usable images  on the 5d (light is only going to fall on portion of the sensor).
a good image is a good image  whether it was shot on film, with digital, or hand drawn on the back of a  stained bar coaster.
i think this is going to be my next birthday  present, its just the weight & cost thats going to hurt - ouch.
but nonetheless the 5d is still probably the most affordable full frame around.
check out thomas hawk's photos www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk which are never shot with a flash and he often shoots in very lowlight at iso 1600.
the camera is always ready when you are.
perspective is a natural resolt of that...
this is a photo of pro photographers using predominantly eos systems at the olympics in 2004, a very demanding situation where "every moment counts" (your phrase).
ofcourse the brand has no impact on the photos you make, and neither does  it make you a better photographer than you are.
it is my opinion that it is "cheating" to use some of the  more advanced photoshop functions to manipulate your image because they allow  you to create a "better" image than you originally captured.
and then there were the old family photos, one dating  to 1899.
and, with that said, what would be my best alternative for event  photography?
microdrives are also more prone to failure than the solid-state cf  cards and i do not recommend them.
i have used a canon 1ds mark i and ii and i found the quality to be  excellent.
when i purchased my first 35mm camera 26 years ago, i realized a new brush.
not that it matters, but i think one would do better to search for 5d on the eos forum than to pay much attention to the comments here.
if you are on the street and would like a dependable camera that understands you...go nikon.
it is still a hard decision; i think i will be shooting with the d200 for a bit longer and wait to see if nikon do go ff or if they stay with dx.
mark powell , april 14, 2007; 03:58
you could be in the middle ages  handing out 8x10 prints to spectators moments after the joust ended in a fatal  impalement.
needless to say i am still using my 20d for demanding shoots, but i am considering a 1d mark iii or a 1ds mark ii.
it doesn't matter whether you use film or digital.
there is a greenish hue to everything, which is unnerving when you are under the gun on a paid shoot.
and, with that said, what would be my best alternative for event photography?
one last  thing, i found my 28-80 was not wide enough in some situations for weddings.
i'll bring both along  with me and use 3 or 4 lenses interchangeably (along with a little lx3 for  videos and stereo shots).
but i have taken a lot of  pictures.
there are a lot of good cameras out there from quite a number of  manufacturers.

--lannie shane phil , july 19, 2007; 12:46 a.m. i have tried both canon and nikon systems, and here is my 2 cents worth: canon is an excellent system if you have the time and patience to play around with its settings, especially the iso which is not automatic.
digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images and are  extremely useful tool for the most common circumstances.
a.m. hi how do you leave the 5d on a tripod and use a self timer that lasts for atleast an hour and shoot continously.
my 20d exposes backlighting  perfectly and this camera costs over half as much of a 5d.
you could be in the middle ages handing out 8x10 prints to spectators moments after the joust ended in a fatal impalement.
can anybody give me some suggestions?
and we all know that good home cooking is best, but sometimes a quick takeaway hits the spot as well.
so i am in the same:  will continue scanning till they get a product that won't be obsolete in less  than five years.
they are very fast for dslrs.
i still don't enjoy the digital darkroom  that much
i just got everything in the mail today and i am experiencing major vignetting from this lens.
its just my personal opinion just like anyone else's on this site.
this month covers the topic of white balance.
jeremey barrett , may 18, 2007; 12:22 a.m. robert (ingram), the sigma dc 17-70 is designed for aps-c sized sensors, not full frame sensors like the 5d. the salesperson should absolutely have known that and they should take it back, it simply won't produce usable images on the 5d (light is only going to fall on portion of the sensor).
the eos 5d is not designed for use in a continuous downpour or very dusty  environment like the canon eos 1ds mark ii, though it is a basically rugged and  well-sealed design.
it needs to be supported with acceptable, not super,  equipment.
the daunting nature of the  processes involved in film would explain (along with relative cost) the  explosion of new digital users.
i won't perform any  manipulations such as replacing colors or pasting other  "non-original" images into the photoa.
i love the fact that the 5d has 12.8 megs of  image boosting power but for difficult shoots i find myself using the 20d. i  really think canon dropped the ball on this one.
tom moore , january 25, 2007; 08:35 p.m. i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film.
the eos 5d is not designed for use in a continuous downpour or very dusty environment like the canon eos 1ds mark ii, though it is a basically rugged and well-sealed design.
if someone is prepared to arm themselves with generic photographic techniques in order to digitally capture the best possible image in front of the camera, then manipulate that image's properties to produce a work of art, then surely their efforts and dedication to the photographic art should be encouraged and commended?
what specifically is the effect you are talking about?
controls canon's eos 5d has the standard four exposure modes: metered manual,  aperture-priority, shutter-priority, and program autoexposure.
there is no magnification with the  smaller sensor cameras.
a little over sampling and sharpening seems to make  a very nice print at 13x19.
whatever software you choose to use, you won't have to spend too much time  post-processing due to the eos 5d's inclusion of a mercury switch to orient  photos.
the 1.6 sensor makes my 400mm 640.
nikon's metering and flash systems are state of the art.
thanks, david beren patterson , march 12, 2007; 02:32 a.m. i'm hanging out for the 5d mark ii!
i got mine  used for $1000!
again,  my answer is only a guess.
alan cukurs , may 30, 2008; 02:11 a.m. gotcha.
similarly, if we assert that digital photographers are somehow disadvantaged by having to contend with the colour space interpretations of a third-party, while not mentioning the colour bias traditionally imparted by different makes of film, it seems nonsensical.
usm, (compare prices) (review), which is  essential for day-to-day and low light photography, you will probably want the  following standard professional zoom lenses: canon ef 16-35mm f/2.8l ii usm, (compare prices) canon ef 70-200 f/2.8l is ii usm, (compare prices)
find a extremely rare and sought after collectors film camera and outfit it with the outstanding rare and obscure sought after glass.
thus you're able to manually adjust focus but have automatic assistance available when desired.
i'm very fond of wide lens photography and i wouldn't like to lose my cheap 19-35mm :).
siya singh , january 14, 2007; 09:40
i've read many posts regarding dust issues right out of the box.
wow, we are in the early  stages of digital photography, think how people will see early digital as  oldskool and cool, a footprint of our current age.
i  think i may be selling this one soon.
i do not choose a camera based solely on market share, of course, but such data are not irrelevant to me.
be aware of online scams.
it is possible, just a question of  self- control.
antonio correia , october 21, 2007; 06:14 p.m. at the moment - october 2007 - with the 40d in the market would you still buy the 5d, instead ?
i do not know about the engineering but i seem to get much better pictures in low light situations with the fullframe.

as  far as i am concerned, if you are trying to make what you do take less time and  be more efficient, then perhaps you should rethink what it is you are doing.
collect cans and shoot weddings with a popcan pinhole array!
but in order to do that you first have to downsize the pictures to  match the beamer's resoloution, which is somewhat less than 1.75mp if it is  bang up to date and hd-ready with 1080i.
i found two shops that sell the 5d for $849 and  the 400d for $339 which is incredibly cheap.
i ended up using it like a (very expensive!)point and shoot.
the 13-megapixel canon eos 5d single-lens reflex digital camera is the  first consumer-priced ($2700) full-frame sensor body.
you may want to do what i'm going to do, buy it from a local retailer  where you can inspect it first.
as with all of the great  canon eos bodies over the decades, if you drill down into the custom function  menus, you can figure out how to make the autoexposure lock button on the back  of the camera into a "burst of af" thumb switch while in manual focus  mode.
the camera has an internal buffer memory for rapid sequence photography (17 raws or 60 jpegs).
why can't canon make a wide angle zoom as good as nikon's 17-35 2.8?
george carter , december 16, 2006; 03:19 p.m. i bought my first dslr a canon 30d about 6 months ago and have been well pleased.
you will also see who has thier work hanging in art galleries and  museums, and all the true art publications.

i already own a sigma  10-20mm and a nikon 18-200mm for this job.
karl westphal , april 28, 2007; 10:22 p.m. i was thinking about buying a 5d but have decided to wait a month and buy a 1d mark iii.
vincent martin's compelling contribution to this discussion highlights the  superiority of both the quality and professionalism associated with  state-of-the-art film-based work.
nedine o'brien , february 27, 2007; 06:21 a.m. greetings all, i've only been studying photography for three years and started doing  b&w film in a wet darkroom.
but having a crappy camera  and a great eye prevents you from getting the right output especially if you  think of commercially gaining from it.
the only problem for deciding  for 5d is the price.
from where you stay it's normal to have perspective because the viewpoint where you are when taking that photo is lower not perfectly "perpendicular" and also in the middle of the buildyng (sorry my english, i'm not a native...)
just great for reportage, especially in low light situations.
david palermo , march 01, 2007; 03:45
i don't see the interpolated finepix megapixels exceed the canon.
there are two  control wheels so that you can adjust aperture and shutter speed simultaneously.

imagine all the gold coins and shillings you would collect!
about the only reason i can see to ante up the extra money and haul  around the added weight of the 70-200mm f/2.8l would be if one routinely takes  action pictures in low light or if one is obsessively enamored of blurry  backgrounds.
for taking pictures of sporting events without breaking your arm, you'll want acanon ef 300mm f/4l is usm, (compare prices) (review).
joao pedro jorge , january 13, 2008; 02:36 p.m. i've been reading reviews on the 5d and the 40d because i'm thinking of buying a new camera.
the is will help with camera shake more than the extra stop will for the same  money.
my 5ds had a defective light meter.
so hurray  nikon and hurray pentax.
are you ever actually going  to look at any of those pictures again?
i do weddings, seniors, kids, families etc... i'm a canon user
now, if digital only had the same effect on good canon glass...... alan cukurs , april 17, 2008; 01:42 a.m.
just great for reportage, especially in  low light situations.
a little consideration more: the  hasselblad h3d-22 (that's a heavy medium format bazooka) has a 4080x5440 square  format sensor that produce a 22mpx file or, in print-size terms, a 13x18 print.
i.e., sports photographers might want to consider one of the eos 1d bodies  specifically designed for their rapid-fire needs.
no dings, scratches, and best of all no internal damage to camera or lens.
eye relief is just barely adequate for people wearing eyeglasses.
heck, the pentax k10d trounces the 40d due  solely to its in body anti shake.
it is possible, just a question of self- control.
memory card i can shoot away all day long and statistically speaking i will have a few great images; with film unless i had tons of cash i would have to plan my shots and make decisions on which to take.
claudia veja , september 16, 2006; 08:15 a.m. about ellypses @ jean-baptiste avril
digital has made it too easy for anyone to get into photography (i'm not  saying this is a bad thing!).
there are many settings if you would need them but to many for what i need,i will not need another camera now i have this one what ever canon brings out,mind you if i was a lottery winner,well, say no more !
for me, the argument in favour of digital is all about time, practicality and accessibility.
the original 5d  is looking rather outdated.
when i work i  constantly use the histogram and i need to make snap judgments based on the lcd  image and my exposure readings.
kudos to the many moderate voices above and those that focus on the individual's artistic process above considerations of equipment and technology.
maximum flash sync  speed is 1/200th.
the reason why you don't  have perfect paralel lings there.
i must say that the  5d's image quality is great.
dust is an issue with digital slrs, but not right out of the box!
it is more than good enough for most professional  photojournalism applications, but still simple enough that a yuppie can get one  to throw in the glovebox of his bmw suv and take pictures at the school soccer  game.
i put aside all thought of film and decided to learn how to use digital properly.
would be quite happy using l series primes, only need to purchase 25mm l and that would complete my lens complement.
why would i spend extra money on  development and enlargement on a photo that cannot even be manipulated on basic  levels that is such commonplace in digital photography today?
and they are the present and the future of photography, i know that
arguing that shooting film is a more creative process than shooting digital is like saying writing a novel with a pen and ink is more creative than using a typewriter or computer.
the difference between film and digital isn't that any rich moron can  take great pictures with a $7000 camera (they can't).
the canon always looks to me like reduced, i guess it is the color palette, or the cmos sensors.
i would not sell any of my images.
******************************************** hi brian-i don't think i am really qualified to answer any questions in this forum but will take a guess at the answer to this one simply because no one else has replied.
i enrolled in a digital class and things  changed.
this is particularly the case as i like to take a fair number of wide angle - generally 25mm ( in 35 mm slr speak) to 35mm.
janice m , february 19, 2007; 01:29 a.m. brian's question: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot  then then i ever did with film."
so far as this is concerned, given the very diffucult engineering required to produce a high quality wide angle zoom, i would prefer to purchase wide angle prime lens :
though noisier than a point-and-shoot digital camera, the canon eos 5d is extremely quiet in operation, quieter than any modern film body and with a slightly more muted and lower frequency shutter "thunk" than the small sensor canon bodies.
digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images and are extremely useful tool for the most common circumstances.
microdrives are also more prone to failure than the solid-state cf cards and i do not recommend them.
in some respects, art is the way one interprets what one perceives and presents that interpretation so others can experience that expression.
crop and zoom are clear and sharp.
cheers shane michael brown , july 29, 2007; 06:40
i only shoot in digital and believe my photography is beauty which i have  created and cherish the percentage of the shots which are excellent.
i have not thrown away my watercolors or my 35 mm cameras etc., i have just added to what i enjoy.
i've read many posts regarding dust  issues right out of the box.
dynamic range while ok in the 5d is not as good as the s3 pro (and now the s5).
if you are rich and dumb, i would definitly suggest going digital.
if you're going to take a lot of portraits, e.g., of a baby, and don't want to endure the weight of the 70-200/2.8, consider a primecanon ef 100mm f/2 usm, (compare prices) (review).
just google the name of the shop and reviews, like, in my case was: "bestpricecameras reviews" so, it seems that the cheapest 40d (not scam) price was around $1000 and the 5d around $2200.
one nit: the 100mm f/2 is not the only alternative to the  70-200mm f/2.8l.
the d2xs is a superb camera, but don't have the large canon's sensor nor the tremendous s5 dynamic range.
nicholas eskey , april 03, 2008; 02:10 a.m. i was in ritz camera store today, looking to see if they still had canon 5d's in stock, since most of the camera stores in san diego seem to not, and i spoke with the counter guy about it.
i use photoshop but only to do the most basic image adjustments such as  cropping, resizing, adjusting levels and curves, etc.
amazon... not so much- trying to be everything to everyone has negatively  impacted their customer service.
the 5d has the standard focus modes of any canon slr: manual, single-shot  auto, continuous auto, and "ai focus" where the camera tries to  figure out whether or not your subject is moving.
i bought the digirebel (body only) 18 mos ago and this camera paid for  itself immediately because i used to spend-at a minimum-at least $100 per month  in film and developing.
but hey, you got to  pay the bills right?
i do notice that sales are going up and higher resolution, better colours, less distortion etc. is not the last reason for that :) and don't forget glass.
this is a big step up from the 10d and 20d which i use for back up, but i agree that the industry is geting too pricy for consumer or semi pro photographers.
as for the 5d, i bought mine over a year ago and love it every second of the time i am using it, as well as looking at the finished work.
i am sure you will  enjoy your eos3.
but try that little experiment: you took some photos with your brand new  2,799usd canon5d, some are truly artistic masterpieces and you want to print  them.
without some kind of linguistic shorthand here, we are going to  have to teach basic physics every time we try to discuss lens  selection--leaving the typical photographer with either glazed eyes or a  dumbfounded expression.
sensitivity is adjustable from iso 50-3200 but there is no good reminder  of what you've got set and the setting is persistent if you turn the camera off  and back on overnight.
viewfinder coverage on the canon eos 5d is standard for an advanced amateur single-lens reflex camera, about 96 percent of what is recorded on the sensor is displayed in the viewfinder.
would be quite happy using  l series primes, only need to purchase 25mm l and that would complete my lens  complement.
in all seriousness, nikon has been lagging behind canon for years now, especially when it comes to long lenses and of course full frame digital.
if you are a serious photographer, you will want to purchase and carry a  backup bp-511a battery (the same battery that canon has used in the 20d and the  gn point-and-shoot models).
however i know that doing a wedding or journalism is so much simpler with digital.
that's pretty sad, considering what a tour de force of technology the 5d's sensor is.
vincent martin , july 30, 2006; 05:01 a.m. i have read the above and there are a great variety of inputs and some poinient and timely infomrations.
i  suggest mr. greenspun do a little more research before making completely  invalid statements which mislead camera buyers and uniformed photographers.
xiaoyuan gu , november 28, 2007; 10:12 a.m. it is time for canon to throw the goodies of 1d mkiii and 40d to a 5d mkii, to seriously compete with the nikon d3.
i've got one issue to clear up.
if so, i would prefer to get by with the  quality small sensor 40d.
i have a quality range of l series glass and if i went down the full frame path, would purchase couple of wide angle primes.
dynamic range while ok in the 5d is not as good  as the s3 pro (and now the s5).
the canon eos 5d cannot run  on disposable aa batteries.
with the 5d, what you got with your 20mm lens on the film camera is what you get with the 5d. the canon eos 5d is compact and plasticky, but solidly built.
i got two cheap lenses: the ordinary ef 28-90 and a  voigtlander 19-35mm.
it's status as 'last season's fashion' will help drive second hand
if the 5d is a tough as my 30d i will  be well pleased.
it's just seems ironic to me that a $3000-2500 camera doesn't have a lcd screen as good as my $500 point and shoot.
the 5d takes a single compact flash card, either type i and ii.
i for one regret immensely never being schooled in film, however there is so much to learn in digital as well.
perhaps i don't keep up as well  as when i had the business.
i would also, obviously, love their to be a  price reduction, but that might be wishful thinking.
the canon eos 5d turns on almost instantly and has unmeasureable delays for taking pictures, displaying previews, and waking up once asleep.
but i think film camera are still useful today.
then i could have some real fun!!
more and more  people are going digital, thus driving down demand and prices for film gear.
after seeing countless people come in with photos  from a hell of a lot of different proffessional cameras, i would have to say  that almost everything from the canon 5d has been the closest i have seen to  film quality.
i think the true test of a photographer is attempting to take the same quality images with a film camera, as you can create using a digital camera with hours of photoshop work afterwards.
if i decide to  switch to canon now is the time since i don't have too much nikon equipment.
as for the 5d, i bought mine over a year ago and love it every second of  the time i am using it, as well as looking at the finished work.
but i have taken a lot of pictures.
do a store review before purchasing.
not in my experience.
if you downloadmicrosoft raw image  thumbnailer and viewer for windows xp, you can sort photos to some extent just  using the standard windows file browser.
operating speed the canon eos 5d turns on almost instantly and has unmeasureable delays  for taking pictures, displaying previews, and waking up once asleep.
you can't be going into the bride and groom's face to lock in an exposure reading.
when working with raw images, this is rather sluggish on all but the very newest and most powerful pcs.
after 'restoring' them for presentation at my father's 90th birthday, i found i rather liked the feel of these vintage images and now find myself trying to make new images look old.
the underscore means the white space was changed from srgb to adobe rgb.
i still don't enjoy the digital darkroom that much
digital unlocks  creative possibilities because you never have to worry about how many shots you  have left (or how many you need to get the image you want).
as a canon user with too much money sunk into the system to switch on a whim like the beginners without a good set of lenses or the moneyed elite who seem to switch weekly, i hope that nikon absolutely trounces canon with its new full frame d3 and its d300 cameras.
such are the relative natures of well-established and on the other hand, emerging technologies.
in all it's been a hell of a workhorse camera for me, producing  consistently high quality images even under adverse conditions.
the current relative merits and weaknesses of both media have been well-detailed and seem almost rhetorical now.
if you are a workhorse photographer, that is you are commercial, then you  have things like time and money to worry about, and you need to find the best  and most efficient and inexpensive tool for the job.
canon's quality control has diminished in my mind and i'm disappointed that all they would do was document my two cases of dust right out of the box.
i have found some really good deals on medium format  cameras.
but much more important than resouloution is the amount of contrast that you can record.
i used bronicas and a number of canon bodies and lenses.
the canon eos 5d does not have a built-in flash.
shane, here is a group of guys who just might disagree with you.
search for prices for the camera i wanted.
the noise just looks like a bad quality image to me  it doesn't give the atmosphere or mood that film grain does.
zhero.net jonathan farmer , march 22, 2007; 01:31 p.m. can anyone give a honest opinion on how the 5d, d2xs and the finepix s5 compare with respect to image quality.
" conclusion the canon eos 5d is the essential camera for everything that photographers  used to do with 35mm film.
if you are a serious photographer, you will want to purchase and carry a backup bp-511a battery (the same battery that canon has used in the 20d and the gn point-and-shoot models).
but nonetheless the 5d is still probably the most affordable full frame  around.
in my humble opinion, it is not the equipment or the media it is the art, the composition, inspiration and good light that makes a good picture.
10:54 a.m. frankly for being such a fantastic camera and for philip being an experienced photographer there are some seriously over exposed pictures on this review.
there are remedies for this, similar to shooting 35mm  film with a wide angle lens.
my oldest son it taking a photography class, and i found out to my dismay, it  is a digital photography class.
it makes an image that goes into the  computer nice n easy.
digital cameras and the digital workflow have made creating or capturing a  great image much easier and much more likely for novice and amateur  photographers (i admit i am one of these people however i have a "moral  code" regarding the level of digital adjustments i will make).
you will also see who has thier work hanging in art galleries and museums, and all the true art publications.
cheers robert cudlipp , june 04, 2008; 05:12 a.m. i have a canon 20 d and am very happy with it.
i understand vincent's viewpoint but we all have different levels of  purism.
but i also love  the grainless look of the digital.
for my purposes, though, resolution and low light performance aren't huge issues, so my olympus e1 is actually better in other regards: much smaller and lighter, weatherproofed, and better lenses (in my price range).
i'm no big fan of nikon, i just like the cameras they make.
get a sort of average price.
my only recourse is to purchase from a local dealer where i can inspect the camera before i buy it to make sure there is no dust in the viewfinder.
but if you use the camera like a creative tool maybe the question makes a little more sense.
i shoot glamour and getting those warm glowing skintones is paramount.
all in all, the 5d has made me shoot things i would never have shot  without it.
as a keen amateur for 25 years, i've owned a 5d for almost a year now and continue to be wowed by the results it yields, with, like any camera, a discerning eye, a sensitivity for the subject matter and a sense of imagination...
i have read that nikon produce better color and resolution and that many people are sold more on the amount of megapixles than anything else, please see the link below.
i took it to canon factory service and they said there was nothing they could do.
the common error that philip greenspun's review push forward is thinking that digital camera is the best solution for all or, in another formulation, that digital camera are simply better than film ones.
so i'm  hoping that i've found the best of both worlds.
mercifully, canon does not include a cheap zoom lens as part of a  "kit" with the eos 5d.
these may be more expensive than the sigma but the point of having a 5d is so you can produce quality pictures, so go with the quality lens aswell!!
with digital one has to be very precise and disciplined  in order to not "overshoot" and make thousands of worthless crap  pictures without any appeal and interest.
home > equipment > canon > eos 5d jon sienckiewicz offers a juiced-up user guide for creative people via his "missing pages" column on photo.net.
it is  still a great camera but showing its age with only a 4.1 mp imaging sensor.
all i'm finding are rumors.
i.e., sports photographers might want to consider one of the eos 1d bodies specifically designed for their rapid-fire needs.
you are not asking the design engineers to overcome significant and difficult design compromises by desiging "one wide angle zoom that suits all" etc.
now, i just delete the bad ones and print only the good ones!
balancing flash and natural light is straightforward.
memory card i can shoot away all day long and statistically speaking i  will have a few great images; with film unless i had tons of cash i would have  to plan my shots and make decisions on which to take.
you know that a good print (say lambda) must be  300dpi to be called a good photo-print...and so?
sure, i could build a great vintage camera for much less money than a 5d, but i'd spend more on film, paper, chemicals and processing in 1 month than i would on a good digital camera.
well, i love the 5d camera, but to dismiss nikon as a small company with  clever optical engineers is, well, way, way off.
after much review, i am purchasing the  5d. i think it will be a wonderful brush to paint with.
the 30d got jerked off a folding table and hit a concrete floor and bounced first on one corner, next on the lens shade, and finally on it's back.
now i have this one what ever canon brings out,mind you if i was a lottery  winner,well, say no more !
the 5d, on the other hand, is  better in the following situations: you have a lot of older canon eos lenses that cast a full-frame image you love wide angle photography and want to have a good choice of wide  angle lenses you want to take pictures in low light without a flash you think it is ridiculous to haul around a huge heavy lens designed to  cover the 24x36mm frame of film and then only capture the central 15x22mm  portion with a small sensor slr.
i have used 1d mkii, 14n, slr/n, s3pro.
film kills digital, i know this.
now, though not being a maniac of the very latest gadget, the possibility  of a new 5d version makes me slow down my upgrade...
it is still a hard decision; i think i will be  shooting with the d200 for a bit longer and wait to see if nikon do go ff or if  they stay with dx.
this is very useful for tripod and macro work.
and you  don't even need electricity for that one!!
vincent martin's compelling contribution to this discussion highlights the superiority of both the quality and professionalism associated with state-of-the-art film-based work.
on the  price, are you getting one used?
i enjoy film and still  purchase film equipment.
its hard to find real photographers now as anyone with a fairly good digital is now branding themselves as pro photographers......
i am waiting for the 5d mkii, and keeping my finger crossed that canon with stay with 12mp to keep the single pixel size of 8.2um of the 5d, and come up with a quality lcd such as that found on the new nikons, dust removal (5d is a dust magnet) and liveview functions.
the reason why you don't have perfect paralel lings there.
i'll bring both along with me and use 3 or 4 lenses interchangeably (along with a little lx3 for videos and stereo shots).
it is much cheaper for  canon to make a small sensor than a big sensor.
but it is now in  need of repair :-(
where n is there is option?
if you have $7000 to spend, a strong back to carry the weight, and a quick mind to take in the many displays and complex user interface, the eos 1ds mark ii might be better than the 5d. the canon eos 5d, however, will do most professional jobs.
digital cameras and the digital workflow have made creating or capturing a great image much easier and much more likely for novice and amateur photographers (i admit i am one of these people however i have a "moral code" regarding the level of digital adjustments i will make).
to recharge the battery you must carry a chunky  travel charger that plugs directly into a wall socket.
and in this time i have started selling images through stock agencies.
similarly, if we assert that digital photographers are  somehow disadvantaged by having to contend with the colour space  interpretations of a third-party, while not mentioning the colour bias  traditionally imparted by different makes of film, it seems nonsensical.
canon still has a bit to learn from nikon in some areas.
the following images were taken at iso 800: the included lith-ion battery is adequate for a day of active photography, somewhere between 300 and 500 photos plus review.
a child's first year canon eos 5d
i just can't seem to get a saturated look on the lcd  and it causes frustration during the shoot.
if you take 100 pictures in quick succession, don't be alarmed when the "low battery" symbols flashes.
after 'restoring' them for presentation at my father's 90th birthday,  i found i rather liked the feel of these vintage images and now find myself  trying to make new images look old.
these may be more expensive than the sigma but the point of having a 5d is so  you can produce quality pictures, so go with the quality lens aswell!!
landrum kelly , july 19, 2007; 09:10 a.m.go nikon!
i am thinking about a 5d, but frankly i shoot  wildlife on the wing that shows well and once in a while sells with the 6.3 i  have.
i have much more respect for a photographer who creates a wonderful sunset image with both the sky and foreground having a good balance of exposure than someone who merged two images together and created a high dynamic range image.
it is still a great camera but showing its age with only a 4.1 mp imaging sensor.
i use photoshop but only to do the most basic image adjustments such as cropping, resizing, adjusting levels and curves, etc.
evan bedford , january 07, 2012; 09:48 p.m. i have a 5d and a mamiya 645.
best regards andrew klerck , may 03, 2007; 03:44 a.m. i work at a photo lab.
so what's the big deal?
alan cukurs , june 07, 2008; 02:56 a.m.
it is the same as film and digital to me,  you end up with a photograph at the end but they are not the same.
i typically am not shooting high speed photography
although i have never shot either, the specs on the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x are very, very impressive.
i had own my own photo business which i closed about the time i converted to digital in 2003.
antonio correia , october 21, 2007; 06:14 p.m. at the moment - october 2007 - with the 40d in the market would you still  buy the 5d, instead ?
so for many looking for a full frame caera a used 5d may well  still be a good buy.
claudia michael kelly , september 21, 2006; 10:48 a.m. i've gone through two eos 5d bodies in one week, both purchased from  amazon.com.
it has meant a huge learning curve for me.
before digital, i had to pay to have the negatives developed and the photos printed--the good ones and the bad ones!
i don't believe you can take a grainy image with digital.
is full frame visibly sharper to the viewer than 1.6 at  usual viewing distances?
and i  though my light meter was off.
a little over sampling and sharpening seems to make a very nice print at 13x19.
joao pedro jorge , january 19, 2008; 10:08 p.m. thanks alan!
yes, i chose my camera based on my requirements, and i recommended them on  this site.
i know the problem from my old film eos and i've never been happy about this af.
i almost lost it in  a pawnshop in las vegas after i ran out of money!
patty larue , october 28, 2010; 10:20 a.m. i have the canon 5d and have been using with the 70-200 heavy lens for portrait work and weddings can someone please tell me what  other lens to buy to replace this heavy lens for every day before i have to  have surgery my neck can not take it.
whilst recent advances have  been made in the film domain, they are small and in the future, further  advances are likely to remain small, when compared to the strides that have  been taken in the digital domain in recent years.
if you do not create your art  and have a bonafide craft in digital art (like making fantastic looking things  painstakingly in photoshop or other based primarily on visions in your head),  then you are basically putting your faith in those who decided how a certain  color etc. should be rendered on a screen ie color spaces, color balance and  the like.
why can't canon create a metering system like nikon's color 3d matrix  metering?
the creative process is not dependant on the tools.
i then went to a local camera store and had the sales person recreate a backlit situation in store with the same results.
nikon is a small company with clever optical  engineers.
the richness and detail of his photos at  1600 are amazing.
i rather, uh, suspect that phil g. is aware of the crop factor if an idiot  such as myself is, and that is why he was very careful to insert the word  "effectively."
shellie latham , november 03, 2009; 12:12 p.m. i need help picking a camera!
sure, i know it's a lot bigger than  than the 20d and i've read all the who-ha of people praising it
some reviewers think that the 70-200mm f/4l is is a  "better" lens (sharpness, etc) than the f/2.8l at the same apertures.
guido ersettigh (milan) , october 08, 2006; 05:45 p.m. claudia our friend knows well perspective theory in fact he used a lens  that lets you basculate its axis in order to correct perspective distortion  along one direction - optical bank lets you move, thanks to the bellow system,  in any direction so you can correct distortion along any axis or put an whole  item in focus even if it's not parallel to the lens -.
but having a crappy camera and a great eye prevents you from getting the right output especially if you think of commercially gaining from it.
the camera has an internal buffer memory for rapid sequence photography  (17 raws or 60 jpegs).
i think this is going to be my next birthday present, its just the weight & cost thats going to hurt - ouch.
i am afraid that the answer is the first one, because canon don't say anything about it in the "specs", anouncing it proudly when they explain the advantages of the new brand eos-1ds mark iii.
after seeing countless people come in with photos from a hell of a lot of different proffessional cameras, i would have to say that almost everything from the canon 5d has been the closest i have seen to film quality.
nikon's build quality and ergronomics are way ahead of canon's.
even a camera like the d40 has a much  superior lcd than the 5d.tests say the nikon's vibration reduction system is  better than canon's is system.
i won't perform any manipulations such as replacing colors or pasting other "non-original" images into the photoa.
i enjoy using my 5d as much as ever and will continue to do so.
i am hoping to use a d2x and get the same quality but maybe the 5d will do well.
jdm von weinberg , june 16, 2009; 02:52 p.m.
digital is just someone's opinion, but i find it highly inflammatory for no reason at all.
nothing like objectivity. .
actually i've done exactly that, and you were right :(.
it may not make a lot of sense to anyone else, but i've found utility in blue-channel noise that most everyone else wants to disown.
they're 13mpx, that's to say near the state of the art for a digital 35mm size-like camera.

if he had not seen the problem, he would not have chosen his words so carefully.
the canon speedlite 580ex ii flash, (compare prices) (review) is canon's  current top of the line and it usefully covers an angle as wide as a 14mm lens.
obviously there is nothing better to them than  full-frame sensor in 5d but how really bad is with autofocus in 5d?
it is maybe not a spectacular, but a very solid and high quality camera that can give very good files.
if they have not explored film far enough,  and do not require some huge size out of the ordinary output, they probably  will not know what they are missing switching to digital.
so far there is no firmware update to correct this.
janice m , february 19, 2007; 01:29 a.m. brian's question: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."
you cannot use those mediums in the same way yet you have what is called a 'painting' in the end.
i loved shooting in film for sooo long, but even the negs of the pictures i took are just sitting up in a box somewhere.
maybe i just bought the only 5d  lemon.
vincent martin , july 30, 2006; 05:01 a.m. i have read the above and there are a great variety of inputs and some  poinient and timely infomrations.
although not the fastest camera  for action shots, it is hardly "a patient studio photographer's  camera," and no one who has used it would characterize it thus.
the eos 30d and digital rebel are better values.
i have to admit, however, that both the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x shoot  more frames per second than the 5d.
unfortunately that particular lens with 5d seems to produce an elliptical unexpected distortion.
this link is not bios in my opinion and it is not writen by nikon.
buck lovell landrum kelly , july 16, 2007; 10:41 a.m. buck, the key word here is "effectively."
i've got two  extra batteries so i may bring them along, although i'm all but certain no one  will let me take a photo to test the sensor.
this sounds great and indeed would be great on a film camera where slide mounts and cropping during enlargement often result in the sacrifice of some of the image at the edges.
how much better is eleven megapixels?
as for printing, guess what, i can print to slides from  digital just as easy as printing on paper if i want to go wet.
but i noticed  right away when shooting some models with strobes, they looked like crap
i took it to canon factory service and they said there was nothing they could  do.
(the guys you see on television might have the 600/4, but that comes in its own suitcase and costs more than a small kia sedan.)
i work mostly with available light so i have to have to make sure i buy a camera that is best for low lighting conditions - i shoot hotel interiors and exteriors as well as very high resolution virtual tours of cockpits.
shall we not suspend judgment until we have  actually tried them?
i took my d200 to the usa and it survived too!!

it may not make a lot of sense  to anyone else, but i've found utility in blue-channel noise that most everyone  else wants to disown.
and it just doesn't make any sense.
the richness and detail of his photos at 1600 are amazing.
i have shot over 8000 images with my 5d now and evey single one has rivaled the quality of scanned negatives shot with my leica.
i find myself now with amazing  distortions (ellypses) and the canon pro services recently told me it was the  "inconvenience" of full frame captors.
though  noisier than a point-and-shoot digital camera, the canon eos 5d is extremely  quiet in operation, quieter than any modern film body and with a slightly more  muted and lower frequency shutter "thunk" than the small sensor canon  bodies.
if he had not seen the problem, he would not have  chosen his words so carefully.
when working with raw images, this is  rather sluggish on all but the very newest and most powerful pcs.
but if canon is so capable, why is their flash metering system so inferior compared to nikon?
however, digital still-image capture is still very much in its infancy, when compared to the length of time that film has been with us.
as evita m put it so concisely, the real  magic lies with the person taking the photograph.. and frequently, the luck of  catching a passing moment as it happens.. whether a facial expression or the  momentous interplay of light and landscape.
a photographer has to be more skilled to use  film than digital.
does the 5d has it all or is there any solid rumour of upcoming good  upgrades on it in the coming 6 month ?
i also enjoy digital photography and have been able to support my hobby by  creating portraits for people through digital art.
the sensor plane is closer to  the front of the camera with the smaller sensor cameras, nothing else.
i use the 645 lenses on the 5d with a mirex adapter (shift comes in handy, since i do a lot of architecture).
i don't own many lenses - 10.5mm and the 18-70 that came with the  d70.
a real photographer is the one who composes the shot perfectly and with their knowledge and technical ability will be able to capture a beautiful photo in 1 single shot rather than taking hundreds and finding the best one.
aside from all my rambling though, the 5d is definately the best digital  camera out there!
whilst recent advances have been made in the film domain, they are small and in the future, further advances are likely to remain small, when compared to the strides that have been taken in the digital domain in recent years.
i don't believe you can take a  grainy image with digital.

in some respects, art is the  way one interprets what one perceives and presents that interpretation so  others can experience that expression.
kudos to the many moderate voices above and those that focus on the  individual's artistic process above considerations of equipment and technology.
dont know why anyone should get upset over it.
at the moment i have the following canon lens: 24- 70 2.8l; 70 -200 /4l; 135/2l; 80/1.8 ,non l; 50/1.4.
i would guess that the photographer (myself included) can take way more pictures and cheaper than using film because digital pictures are all free until processed.

yes, i chose my camera based on my requirements, and i recommended them on this site.
i do not care about the difference between 12mp and 22mp.
as with all of the great canon eos bodies over the decades, if you drill down into the custom function menus, you can figure out how to make the autoexposure lock button on the back of the camera into a "burst of af" thumb switch while in manual focus mode.
i have been looking at the 5d as my primary and my 30d as my backup so i won't be losing time changing lenses.
p.m. hi, i have the 5d since 1 year now, before the fuji s2 and s3.
i felt compelled to speak up when i read that philip said this is ?
do not complain  about high digicam prices.

i am at the cross roads of staying with nikon optics or going over to canon full frame system (a major expence)
maybe i just bought the only 5d lemon.
the only disadvantage to having a full-frame sensor compared to a small-sensor digital slr body (canon digital rebel or any nikon) is that the small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses, which can be useful when you are doing sports or bird photography.

olympus today announced a new micro four thirds body, the e-m5.
any idiot can use a 7000 dollar digital camera.
when i work i constantly use the histogram and i need to make snap judgments based on the lcd image and my exposure readings.
(seemy photoshop directory for some useful scripts, including those that were used to generate the jpegs you see on this page.)
so it is not so  professional as pretended.
i've done both, and personally, digital allows me sooo much more access to my photos.
digicams will all turn to dust but the film cameras of yesterday will be solid as a rock.
i already own a sigma 10-20mm and a nikon 18-200mm for this job.
a.m. i am six months with this camera and it continues to amaze me.
with digital one has to be very precise and disciplined in order to not "overshoot" and make thousands of worthless crap pictures without any appeal and interest.
to make a  very long story short: both fuji and canon have their strengths, the canon with  the right converter for raw (i prefer canons own one) can produce quite nice  looking results, sharp, low noise etc.
but in order to do that you first have to downsize the pictures to match the beamer's resoloution, which is somewhat less than 1.75mp if it is bang up to date and hd-ready with 1080i.
in the digital  world, however, what you capture in the camera is what you'll be delivering in  a jpeg file, unless you go into a photo editing program and take the trouble to  crop.
and the 50d with its big pixel count in a small crop sensor and the full frame 5d mk ii are both more capable in their noise reduction and in other ways.
plus, you can take more...many more of them and print or save  only the good photos.
lol a bit of dust and air pollution is not enough to name mexico a measure parameter for camera resistance.
on the lcd skintones look washed out, the  finally result on my laptop looked fine
not that it matters, but i think one would do better to search for 5d on  the eos forum than to pay much attention to the comments here.
wow, we are in the early stages of digital photography, think how people will see early digital as oldskool and cool, a footprint of our current age.
having recently found a great deal on a 16-35l,it seems clear that i  should do the right thing and move from a rebel to a 5d(mkii still a little  pricey) to get the full-impact of the glass.
my comments have no impact whatsoever on the  market image of either canon or nikon.
however, whilst there are many happy-snappers out there, who go from low resolution jpeg straight to printer, without so much as a mention of photoshop or the like, there are also photographers, amateur and professional, who are increasingly learning to understand and use the digital medium to great effect.
but it's time to get something more durable and higher resolution.
i find myself now with amazing distortions (ellypses) and the canon pro services recently told me it was the "inconvenience" of full frame captors.
i rather, uh, suspect that phil g. is aware of the crop factor if an idiot such as myself is, and that is why he was very careful to insert the word "effectively."
there is a nice hefty dose of text.
canon's quality control has diminished in my mind and i'm disappointed  that all they would do was document my two cases of dust right out of the box.
difficult to recreat with 35 mm, large format, or even digital cameras.
incredible photos, i have no more need for film.
if you've pressed the playback button and are reviewing images, a quick touch of the shutter release readies the camera to take pictures again.
this link is not bios in my opinion and it is not writen by  nikon.
the best test really is to hand the camera to a novice and see  what happens.
on the lcd skintones look washed out, the finally result on my laptop looked fine
as a keen  amateur for 25 years, i've owned a 5d for almost a year now and continue to be  wowed by the results it yields, with, like any camera, a discerning eye, a  sensitivity for the subject matter and a sense of imagination...
i am at the cross roads of staying with  nikon optics or going over to canon full frame system (a major expence)
05:07 a.m. i have had my canon 5d for about 10 weeks now and i love it a superb  camera,you can crop a small part of a file and the result is still very good,i  also like the idea of changing the iso for each shot when i want to and i can  do it just over a second with no bother at all,the only setting i use is the  iso 50 setting for when i want to use it,some times i use the mirror setting so  when you press the shutter release the mirror shoots up and went you press the  shuter release again it will take the photo which is a good idea when taking  macro shots as the mirror will not vibrate then !
so, given the fact that the 5d is so cheap, should i buy that one instead given the facts that i presented to you?
i would also, obviously, love their to be a price reduction, but that might be wishful thinking.
people throw away old computers just like they will throw away digital cameras.
but hey, you got to pay the bills right?
danny yee , december 30, 2006; 06:35 p.m. the one thing that really impressed me when i had a play with a friend's 5d  was the viewfinder.
yes, canon can do 14bit ad  conversion, but if the pixel picks up only nosier data at first hand, more  resolution in the ad stage simply won't help much - (amplifying the noise)?
sometimes readers, in their emotion, do not read quite so carefully.
as for the 5d, yes, i believe that it has been worth the hype,  in spite of its limitations in terms of speed.
