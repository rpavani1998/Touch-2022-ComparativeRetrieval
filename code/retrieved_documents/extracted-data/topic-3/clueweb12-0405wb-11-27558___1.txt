probably not a lot of difference.

overall, the dust removal system may mean a little less dust on the sensor, but since dust isn't that big a problem in the first place for most users...

i can't really comment on that, other than that i'm happy with the autofocus on the d70 and the d200.
it seems to me this is a gimmick, more or less forced on canon by the "popularity" of the same gimmick in other cameras.
or, perhaps, i should say, why will the dust be attracted to the sticky strip?

it's sometimes (not always) also a function of the lens, if you don't have afs or usm lenses.
i don't think it is any more important than canon's anti-dust feature.
but then, new dust enters too.
there are dogs in every camera system, but you tend to recognize these very quickly once you handle them.

mercedes even tested this technology for their windshields.

so do i, but then cameras are aimed at a certain group of people (the companies of course want these groups to be as large as possible).
re: is dust much of a problem?
and i'm not a very versed person in things small and fiddly.
it is highly questionable whether canon's system is even slightly more effective than a bulb blower.
the d100 or f100 are built like tanks, the d70 would have profited from a bit more environmental sealing.
are there any studies that actually show it works?

just looking for any information that the experts can pass along.
all seem to be a good choice.
my observations of dust say no, it won't.
and the results were what?
a dust removal system and a "composition help" are  two fundamentally different things.
i've watched dust (boredom is a terrible thing!); if the dust removal system were to be used in a situation where the camera was sitting in a table somewhere for several minutes after it was activated, maybe it would work.
not most important, but important, yes.

i still think it's not needed, and not very usefull.
reviewers seem to give nikon lenses the edge, but the differences are minor in any event.
