wynngd member - join date - dec 2005 - location - philippines - posts - 88 between d40 and d50, i'll go for d50 since d40 has less options than d40 but with a few features of d80.
only buy it if you can deal with only auto focusing with motorized lenses.
the 350d has an internal auto focus motor.
true, it has less options but for  it's current going price, it's great value for money and there are alot of  prowd owners shooting amazing photos with this camera.
i have the dilemma of getting a new dslr for a gift for someone(no experience with slr cameras at all).
if budget  isn't an issue, i think the 350d would be the better of the lot.

thank you all for any help.
the 350d is good if you need to crop because you have more room to crop pictures.

the d40 is also lighter and smaller than the d50 and 350d.the d40 has a flash  sync of 1/500th of a second which some people don't use and is usually only  available on higher-end cameras

the image sensor and the rest came from d50.
the 350d has an internal auto  focus motor.
if budget isn't an issue, i think the 350d would be the better of the lot.

the feel of the d40 is much better and it doesn't feel like a toy like the 350d.
between d50 and 350d, well  350d advantage is 8 megapixels while the advantage of d50 is a good ergonomics.
hopefully someone can benefit from this.

350d is too small for me.

only buy it if you can deal  with only auto focusing with motorized lenses.
in d40 you need a lens with autofocus motor.
i'm aiming at the 500-600$ price range(lens included), been reading different reviews for a week and still can't decide which one to choose: nikon d40, nikon d50 or the canon 350d.
the kit lens is moterized and it does a great job too.
canon 350d= 8mp nikon d50,d40=6mp the d40's disadvantage only auto focuses with motorized lenses.

both lenses that come with it auto focus with it too.

the time now is 02:37 pm.
the d50's advantage is that it doesn't require a  motorized lens to focus.
i had the same dilemma earlier this year but after much research i bought the d40.
the 350d is good if you need to  crop because you have more room to crop pictures.
