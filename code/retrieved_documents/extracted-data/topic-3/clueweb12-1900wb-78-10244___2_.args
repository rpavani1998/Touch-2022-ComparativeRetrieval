the 36 x 24mm sensor size - the same size as traditional 35mm film - is ideal for producing the utmost in image quality, and offers greater depth of field control than small sensors.the 18.1mp full-frame sensor can churn out images at 12fps (14fps in high speed mode) and offers other mind-bending features such as extended sensitivity up to iso 204,800 and a 61-point autofocus system.the sheer level of customisation available is phenomenal - it's great for professional photographers who know exactly how they want to set up their focusing system's responsiveness.it's canon's most affordable eos dslr by quite a margin, which makes it best for those on a budget who are looking to step into first-time dslr use.a great choice for professional sports and wildlife photographers, the canon eos 1d mark iv's 1.3x crop factor gives ef lenses (ef-s lenses aren't compatible) that extra reach compared to the full-frame eos models found further up the range.loyal customers help contribute to this success, yet canon's world-class range of up-to-date products ensures there's always something worth coming back for.in the dslr market it's the key player, and has outsold its nearest rivals for several years.a 12 megapixel aps-c sensor delivers decent images, whether using the full array of manual controls or the point-and-shoot creative auto mode.the canon eos 7d is best for demanding amateurs, but is easily good enough to be used professionally.a focusing system with 19 cross-type focus points mean the camera zips onto subjects in portrait or landscape orientation, and the 8fps continuous shooting mode is far quicker than the 60d's 5.3fps burst.but also, due to their design difference, mounting an ef-s lens on a larger-sensor canon dslr would result in damage, due to a clash between the camera's mirror and the rear lens element.although the60d and 7d have a very similar 18mp aps-c sensor as in the 600d, the 7d's higher price and additional features such as full environmental sealing make it canon's highest specified eos dslr with an aps-c sensor.the canon eos 1dx is suited for us by professional photographers working in the studio, out in the field or a mix of both.this means that on an aps-c format canon camera a 100mm lens produces images similar to a 160mm on a full-frame camera, whereas 100mm on a nikon/sony/pentax dslr offers a 150mm equivalent.canon also makes a full-frame dslr series that's a great option for professionals or serious amateurs.
