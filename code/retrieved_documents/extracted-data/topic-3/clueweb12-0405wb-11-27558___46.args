if you buy later, you get the benefit of nothing until later.
i guess it will remove a little bit (the bits that are at the bottom of the sensor) each time it gets switched on.
i don't think it is any more important than canon's anti-dust feature.
the d80 has the ability to turn on a grid helping out with composition >according to the rule of thirds.
i have to admit, though, that i very much like the nikon autofocus system in general.
some say that the color is more of a mutes pastel and appears richer.
i admit, not much useful information, but i hope it helps a bit.
i still think it's not needed, and not very usefull.
>round of camera is shipped.
as for nikon d80 some say that the color is more of a mutes pastel and appears richer.
instead, it's activated when you turn the camera on, and the camera is then moved around.

i can't really comment on that, other than that i'm happy with the autofocus on the d70 and the d200.
bigger grains will obviously drop down more readily.

would the canon on 6mp be inferior in resolution and anti shake perf.
some say that nikon and their lenses have somewhat better construction.
i know the d80 is new and i'm not even sure you can buy one yet.
i think, pick the camera that satisfies your requirements with respect to image quality, ease of use, flexibility, handling etc.
therefore the likelyhood of the dust hitting the sticky bit increases too.

i've watched dust (boredom is a terrible thing!); if the dust removal system were to be used in a situation where the camera was sitting in a table somewhere for several minutes after it was activated, maybe it would work.
just how much of a problem is dust if you change lenses >>frequently? >> >> > >i've watched dust (boredom is a terrible thing!); if the dust removal >system were to be used in a situation where the camera was sitting in >a table somewhere for several minutes after it was activated, maybe it >would work.
on the other hand according to surveys, it noticeably changed their car's image.
they miss out, in the hope that they will get their reward later.
i'm guessing the d80 is better but just wonder how much better.
if you always want the newest, bestest digital camera, you'll be spending lots of money in the coming years.
both cameras are highly dependent on menus to access important settings.
the dust removal system of the canon seems like a very important feature.
which are the better optics.
i think, the "mid-range" lenses (from a price point of view) that both manufacturers sell, are just great w.r.t.
>... > > >>the d80 has the ability to turn on a grid helping out with composition >>according to the rule of thirds.
windshields aren't in the same sort of environlemt as a sensor in a dslr.
dust doesn't fall neatly down, to stick to a vertical sticky strip.
some prelim reviews claim that the canon has a faster and more accurate auto focus.
and the sticky strip is smaller than the sensor, so the dust is more likely to stick on the sensor than on the strip.

few of us here have used both cameras, so it is hard to tell.
the d80 has the ability to turn on a grid helping out with composition according to the rule of thirds.
the idea that any dust knocked off >>the sensor will somehow fall on a (vertical) sticky strip that's many >>time smaller than the sensor is, imho, ludicrous.
before i went the nikon route (back in the film days), i tried to handle as many camera brands as i could to make up my mind.
a nice feature, but not essential.

it just so happened that the nikons tended to feel good in my hands, the controls were in all the right places (with some exceptions, though nothing critical) and the weight and bulk felt "just right" for me.
the dust removal system of the canon seems like a very important feature.
i absolutely love the on-demand grid lines, they help me a lot to keep my photos straight.
no matter what camera you buy, a better one for less money will be available in six months.
> however, they did have a 1/500 flash sync that they removed.
if you plan on waiting until no more significant improvements are being made in digital cameras before buying one, you are going to have a very long wait.
well - if its ultrasound technology, i do assume it works.

we will be looking at the lower end, 350d/400d/d50/d70s/d80 and spend a bit on lenses.
i can use the windshield washer to clean my windshield; i suppose the 8d will have a sensor washer.
there have been threads in this ng which pointed to galleries of sample pics.
pro's may not need it, but i as an amateur certainly think i do.
i would love to have an automatic dust removal system, but i've cleaned my d70 once in the two years i've owned it, it was a 3 minute thing with the right tools.
therefore the percentage of surface covered by the sticky strip increases.
i've had 2 dslrs now, and i don't have a dust problem, so it's not needed.
putting a samyang 19-35 on a f100 and then complaining about the lousy sharpness and the heavy flaring.

the d100 or f100 are built like tanks, the d70 would have profited from a bit more environmental sealing.

the shaking of the sensor occurs when the camera is turned on, meaning it's probably in motion, and the air will be disturbed by the camera's motion.
i'm not in a bad situation now, the d200 being my primary camera, with the d70 as the backup body, should i need it.
i admit, not much useful information, but i hope it helps a bit.
it will be disturbed more by the actuation of the shutter and mirror movement.
by making >one surface vibrate you decerase the surface available for the dust.
so do i, but then cameras are aimed at a certain group of people (the companies of course want these groups to be as large as possible).

you can produce a picture with nikon that looks like a canon picture and vice versa.

overall, the dust removal system may mean a little less dust on the sensor, but since dust isn't that big a problem in the first place for most users...

i have the 18-70 kit lens which has afs, and it's quick and snappy on both cameras, whereas the old 70-300g lens hunts for focus on d70, d200 and f100.

my impression is that canon cameras *by default* have more saturated color.
the importance of good glass cannot be understated.

construction and quality.
mercedes even tested this technology for their windshields.

that is not a huge difference, but when canon claims to be more innovative, they are lying.
the more you can do with an easily accessible dial or button the better.

imo, if you can't visualize such a grid, it probably doesn't matter.

the vibrations will stop, the dust will be in the air.
i think that by then nikon will wake up.
