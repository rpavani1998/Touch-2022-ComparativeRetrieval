i couldn’t put a card in unfortunately, i was handling a pre-production model.

ease of use since i am used to both canon and nikon’s systems, using this camera felt very familiar to me.
online [en] what to say, i am sorry, but shooting with the a77 is just a real pleasure, everything is there … wherever i am, i am shooting and i am really glad with the result, just great … and with the 85mm f1.4 zeiss, ….
however, sony has made a very impressive step forward with the a77.
i couldn’t put a card in unfortunately, i was handling a pre-production model.
the focusing with the lens was also relatively quick, but i still feel that my 7d wins in this case.
overall, the build quality of the a77 seemed very impressive.
though the reviews have already started to come out, i’m still waiting for my units to give them a full run through.
above the lcd screen is that big, gorgeous, and amazing oled viewfinder that i really love.

the sony nex-7 is a much better buy.

hands on: sony a77 by chris gampat on september 28, 2011 the other day, i finally got my hands on the extremely coveted sony a77 camera.

the grip and shutter release are in an interesting position ergonomically, and if i did use it, it would take some getting used to as opposed to those from canon and nikon.
with lcd monitor for videos dimensions 142.6 x 104.0 x 80.9mm (excluding protrusions) weight 732g with battery and card ergonomics the sony a77 is one heck of a beefy dslr camera; especially with the grip on.
there is also a custom function button, display button, and that big lcd screen that flips out in a very innovative way.
