vs canon eos 1d mark iv: iso and noise low-light shooting and super-high iso performance appear to be the priority for the manufacturers of both cameras.
the d3s was tested with a nikon af-s 24-70mm f/2.8g ed lens,  and the 1d with a canon ef 24-105mm f/4l is usm.
both of  the images below were shot hand-held.
both cameras also have a hefty price tag – an rrp of over  £4,000 and street prices of £3,600 and £3,850 for the nikon  and canon respectively.

the fact that both cameras were able to deliver this quality of image when shooting at 9 frames per second or more is simply astonishing.
however, images with both cameras shot at iso 12800 were impressive and very usable.
we tested the cameras in a variety of set-ups and modes, from the fully auto 3d colour matrix metering on thenikon d3s and evaluative mode on the canon eos 1d mark iv to the spot metering modes on both cameras.
the 1d mark iv also did a good job of capturing a range of tones  correctly in tricky lighting conditions.
the canon eos 1d mark iv has  a uniquely sized 16.1mp cmos aps-h sensor, which is half way between full frame  and aps-c. this gives a crop factor of x1.3, and while some users might be  disappointed that the camera isn’t full frame, others – especially  sports photographers shooting from the touchline – will find that little  bit of extra reach they can get from their telephoto lenses a real bonus nikon has gone for full-frame, offering a 12.1mp fx cmos sensor.
both cameras are outstanding, and it’s unlikely  that anyone would be disappointed with their performance and the quality of  images they produce.
the camera produced clean and crisp images despite the fact that it has fewer pixels.
