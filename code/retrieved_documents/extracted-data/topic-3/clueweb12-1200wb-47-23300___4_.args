but a lot of the newer lenses don't "feel good" to old-timers since they're lighter-weight and have less friction in focusing so that auto-focus can work faster.the battery pack with strap makes the camera bigger and heavier but the camera is "on my hand" the entire time that i'm shooting and there's no grip change to move between horizontal and vertical positions.this zoom demonstrated to me that canon was serious about supporting the 1.6x fov form factor cameras via the ef-s lens line, where the image circle is set back farther toward the sensor into the camera.i find too, that with the battery pack/handstrap i'm able to hold the camera on my shoulder or at my side with ease whether i'm shooting in the studio or the field."light and cheap" is a pretty reliable indicator of quality, but a great counter to that notion is canon's ultra-light, ultra-cheap 50mm 1.8.in general, i find the l-series lenses focus faster than the 20d kit lens, despite any disparities in mass or friction.yes, both canon 50mm's, the f/1.8 and the f/1.4 are very nice optically, and they're reasonably tough.i know that in the old days of pure manual-focus lenses, it was nice to have friction so you could smoothly make small adjustments.i've read of it referred to as "not really l quality" and "just a marketing gimmick" but i have to say that i've recently started fantasising about this lens.they're really nice on a 20d, because they're effectively 80mm lens, which is pretty nice working distance and it's also for a wicked fast lens.however, that 20d kit lens is really not terrible optically and it is light.i think it may even be a sort of "second-generation" design, because if you look carefully at the 2x teleconvertor ii (say, for use with the 70-200mm f/2.8l is), you see a very similar optical interfacing trick.i believe tamron makes theirs in a pentax mount plus pentax lenses have traditionally been very good.i appreciate that a 10x zoom ain't gonna be as sharp as a prime, but i don't want it to be worse than the ef-s 17-85mm i have at the moment.wafer-light and sells new for 'round $70-80 but surprisingly sturdy and optically impressive.
