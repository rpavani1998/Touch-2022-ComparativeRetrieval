the shaking of the sensor occurs when the camera is turned on, meaning it's probably in motion, and the air will be disturbed by the camera's motion.i think, pick the camera that satisfies your requirements with respect to image quality, ease of use, flexibility, handling etc.some prelim reviews claim that the canon has a faster and more accurate auto focus.the d100 or f100 are built like tanks, the d70 would have profited from a bit more environmental sealing.both cameras are highly dependent on menus to access important settings.comments please i think, both canon and nikon make very rugged cameras in the "higher class", and both make cameras that are less well built, but still very good.it just so happened that the nikons tended to feel good in my hands, the controls were in all the right places (with some exceptions, though nothing critical) and the weight and bulk felt "just right" for me.i'm not in a bad situation now, the d200 being my primary camera, with the d70 as the backup body, should i need it.i absolutely love the on-demand grid lines, they help me a lot to keep my photos straight.the d80 has the ability to turn on a grid helping out with composition according to the rule of thirds.the photographer takes the pictures, not the camera.the d100 or f100 are built like tanks, the > d70 would have profited from a bit more environmental sealing.you can produce a picture with nikon that looks like a canon picture and vice versa.comments please > > i think, both canon and nikon make very rugged cameras in the "higher > class", and both make cameras that are less well built, but still very > good.some prelim reviews claim that the canon has a faster and more accurate > auto focus.
