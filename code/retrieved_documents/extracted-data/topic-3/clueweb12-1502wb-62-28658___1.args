it also has a then "new" metering system with a 63-zone dual-layer system that gives the user focus and color information to ensure accurate exposure of pictures even when the lighting is difficult or bad.
by contrast, thenikon d300s has a 12.3 megapixel cmos image sensor.
like the d700 which came before, it also has a multi-controller with a separate button in the centre that you use to start recording movies in live view.
no other nikon digital camera prior to the d300s was able to do this.
the nikon's iso range is only 200-3200, although it can be extended up to the equivalent of iso 6400 and down to the equivalent of iso 100.
in fact the high definition video feature is one of this camera's major selling points.
the canon is manufactured with a 19-af system (all cross-type with the centre point offering f/2.8 and f/5.6 sensors), while the nikon boasts 51 af points with 3d tracking.
however, even some ardent nikon enthusiasts will admit that thecanon 7d has the edge, with its 18 megapixel cmos sensor that offers superb resolution.
this is, in any case, now a standard feature of nikon digital cameras.
it offers 1.0x magnification and 100% coverage which its predecessor, the eos 50d didn't offer (that model has only 0.95x magnification and 95% coverage).
thenikon, on the other hand, allows 7 fps continuous shooting, although you can upgrade to 8 fps if you use the optional mb-d10 battery pack.
launched in 2009, several months after thenikon d300s, canon's 7d introduced a new, improved auto-focus system that has a dedicated dual digic 4 processor as well as a different shutter mechanism that enables an unbelievably good 8 fps (frames per second) burst mode.
the settings display screen of the nikon d300s is better than the older d300 (which was launched in 2007).

with the canon you can shoot 18 mp 14-bit images as 8 fps as standard, in a burst of up to 126 large jpegs.
next comes the fact that the nikon d300s offers a 720p hd video.
the idea is that you use one card after the other, for instance writing backups to the second card after saving the photo files; saving raw files to one and jpegs to the other; using one for stills and the other for videos, and so on.
but there is so much more, including an autofocus (af) function that allows you to detect contrast while in movie mode.
this camera has a non-latched memory card opening that was launched with the d700, but with both cf and sd slots which offers amazing flexibility.

in spite of their megapixel differences, both cameras have image sensors that deliver stunning resolution.
what the canon 7d has to offer the canon eos 7d's 18 mp sensor (which canon calls its "intelligent view finder" ) is one of the best things about it, largely due to the new technology it represents.

their lcd (liquid crystal display) screens are also the same size – 3 inches – and both offer 100% viewfinder accuracy and 920,000 dots.

it also has a then "new" metering system with a 63-zone dual-layer system that gives the user focus and color information to ensure accurate exposure of pictures even when the lighting is difficult or bad.
the canon has high sensitivity (iso 12800 – ideal for low light situations where you don't want to use flash) and offers speeds of up to 6400.
