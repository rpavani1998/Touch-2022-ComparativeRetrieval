the nikon pictures works more brilianter because no back light effect.
also, i was wondering if you did a test with these on manual for those who only shoot on m. thanks, great article.
i noticed that when i brought them into lightroom.
being a canon 5d mk ii and 85mm f1.8 usm owner, i decided to put the two lenses in a non-scientific and totally practical test using all available light at around 7pm in nyc and only shooting at f4 and wider for a portrait.
but in this test, i let the cameras do all the work at aperture priority to simulate their metering methods in real life as well.
in the export process, they were resized to 1.5mb on export and 300dpi. image samples
the canon images may be darker and therefore also have a perceived better sharpness, but it’s not really true.
the new nikon 85mm f1.8 is far newer than the canon version: which actually dates back to the film days.
nikon’s front filter thread is just a bit larger than canon’s and the overall feel of the lens is a bit less plasticy.

please support the phoblographer we love to bring you guys the latest and greatest news and gear related stuff.
a known problem with it though is the color fringing wide open; but this is also a problem that plague’s nikon’s optics as shown in theprevious test.

i set both cameras to aperture priority and focused on the same spot of dennis’s eye.
nikon’s metering is better.

chrisgampat agreed das completely disagree.
gear used ergonomics both 85mm f1.8 lenses are very similar.
at this point though, i’d like to remind all the forum readers and people that like to generally sit there and bitch about minor problems like this that those issues are generally easily fixed in post-production software.
i think the pictures of canon for this reason are darker.

the light sky works like back light and affects themselves naturally negatively.

battle of the 85mm lenses: canon 85mm f1.8 vs nikon 85mm f1.8 by chris gampat on march 25, 2012 i was recently able to test fire and show a couple of sample images with the new nikon 85mm f1.8 on my d5100, however i also was able to get my hands on a d700.
also, i was wondering if you did a test with these on manual for those who only shoot on m. thanks, great article.
though their meter readings were very slightly off in aperture priority, it should be noted that in general, canon and nikon do have slightly different metering algorithms and this is just part of how they work.
but the nikon seems to be much sharper — looks like the canon is not properly focused or needs a micro-focus adjustment).
process of the test i tried to shoot this test during the golden hour.
interestingly, both lens focusing rings feel identical.
for this reason when i’m using my nikon cameras, i always usually set the camera to be -1/3 and canon i overexpose by around 2/3 of a stop.

i am fansinated by how still the guy is in both sets of pics i also noticed that the canon shots were darker but assumed you had taken them after the nikon shots and it may have been getting darker out.
most of new york city is covered in buildings, and therefore needed to shoot at iso 800 because of the diffused shadow lighting around the area.
at this point though, i’d like to remind all the forum readers and people that like to generally sit there and bitch about minor problems like this that those issues are generally easily fixed in post-production software.
the images were then brought into lightroom 4 beta and had the clarity and sharpness adjusted the exact same amount for each image.

the canon pics have more sky in the background, for this reason the comparison is difficult and not fair.

the canon ones are pretty alright on their own, but seen alongside the nikon, they just look way harsher.

chrisgampat i noticed that when i brought them into lightroom.
both lenses focus extremely fast, though in real life practice i felt that canon’s 85mm f1.8 is still the current champ.
the nikon has much more pleasing bokeh.

the canon has better (sonnar-like) bokeh.

still though, i’d be doing an injustice if i didn’t report on it.

the non-round bokeh balls once stopped down doesn’t help either.
