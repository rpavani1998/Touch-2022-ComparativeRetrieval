so those that think there's a commercial motivation to this are simply being malicious and are spouting uninformed nonsense.
as could be expected, a number of ill-mannered individuals with an apparent axe to grind started commenting on other discussion forums (no guts to do so here, it would seem) ascribing all sorts of motivations to this, most of them uncomplimentary if not downright rude and unkind.
so i picked two lenses which were at least reasonably close, thenikkor 24-120mm f/3.5-5.6 vr and the canon 24-105mm f/4 is.
possibly there's a bit more shadow detail in the canon frame though (look at the iris).
rather, this move is intended to expand my abilities, coverage, and therefore audience.
but a low light level / high contrast situation like this was pretty good for testing available light type shooting.
i have no idea, since we didn't have one handy that day.
the nikon d300 was also on hand, and so i did some comparison shots with it as well.
background regular readers will have noted that i shoot primarily with canon cameras and lenses.
those judgments will have to wait for me to spend more time with a d300 and d3, but will follow in the weeks and months ahead.
but a low light level / high contrast situation like this was pretty good for testing available light type shooting.
we can't shoot with the same lens on both cameras, at least not with the lens selection we had available that day.
but with the introduction of the d300 and d3 a few months ago, and the commencement of their shipping during the last week of november, '07, i now believe that nikon is back in the game.
the 1d mkiii's sensor at 10mp is closer to the d3's 12mp than the 1ds mkiii's 21mp, and the pixels of the nikon are bigger, so theoretically of lower noise.
i had few regrets at the switch through the first 7 years of this decade during the transition to digital, because it's my opinion that with its full frame sensors and superior high iso noise capabilities canon had a clear edge.
and don't lose sight of the fact that you can do so at 5 fps in 14 bit mode, and with 21 megapixel files – the previous domain of medium format.
and lets not forget that by adding nikon to the mix on a regular basis i'm increasing my work load, not to mention the confusion factor when working in the field.

it better suites my needs.
the speeds of iso 6400, 12,800 and 25,600 are also possible on the nikon d3, but not on the canon, so there's no comparison to be made at these levels.
the nikon exposed at 1/50th second and the canon at 1/40th second – not identical but close enough.
nothing terribly formal, but enough tests, with enough pairs of experienced eyes, both canon and nikon users, to come to some preliminary conclusions.
the shot above and its 100% crop show what the camera is capable of at iso 3200.

i don't care for canon's dpp, and haven't yet become familiar with nikon's capture nx.
the d3 is also closer in price to the 1d mkiii than to the 1ds mkiii.
the nikon exposed at 1/50th second and the canon at 1/40th second – not identical but close enough.
in about 1996 i switched from 30 years of shooting nikon because i was attracted to lenses which nikon didn't offer at the time, the canon's t/s and is lines.
this kind of sensitivity provides the ability to capture an image when another camera would simply record soot and shadow, or be forced to use a shutter speed so low as to render an unusable image.
december, 2007 update: i forgot to mention that all images were shot raw and were processed in lightroom 1.3.1.
for this reason i recently purchased a d300 and a few lenses to begin refamiliarizing myself with the current nikon line, and mentioned this on what's new.
so, this isn't about my needing more cameras, or switching from canon to nikon, (which i'm not), or having money burning a hole in my pocket.
so those that think there's a commercial motivation to this are simply being malicious and are spouting uninformed nonsense.
in a 16x20" print none of the artifacts seen in the 100% crop above is visible, and noise is extremely low.
this obviously isn't about advertising, because the only ads on this site (other than my own) are from b&h photo , and they'll happily sell you whatever brand you wish.
as i wrote a little while earlier, based on initial impressions of the d300, and now their first full-frame cmos camera, the d3, nikon is now back in the iq game.
i also did shooting at other speeds, but not in a somewhat controlled comparison like this.
the lighting in my gallery is designed to illuminate framed photographs, not for shooting portraits.
and don't lose sight of the fact that you can do so at 5 fps in 14 bit mode, and with 21 megapixel files – the previous domain of medium format.
and unless you're a total gearheaded pixel-peeper, getting a photograph in tough conditions is much more important than any noise complaints.
if you're a nikon user, or thinking of becoming one and don't have the budget for a d3, the d300 is an extremely capable camera, as will be seen in my forthcoming review.
but with some one million unique readers a month this site needs to reflect from time to time the interests of a broader constituency, and in this case i felt that my lack of nikon coverage was doing a disservice to that segment of the community, especially pros for whom nikon is their tool of choice.
noise is more apparent, and though the exposure was 1/50th second vs the d3's 1/60th second (essentially identical), the image was overall quite a bit darker, indicating that the iso was likely not what the camera indicated it was; maybe iso 1000 in reality, and the apparent dynamic range somewhat less as well.
because that's the canon's highest setting without going into a boost mode.
don't do it on some other site where you know i won't respond.
as for pixel count, 24mp makes sense if you scale up the 12mp d300's 1.5x chip.
both cameras produced iso 1600 images of astonishing quality.
aperture was set to f/6.3 and the shots were taken in aperture priority mode at iso 1600.
regulars on my forum know that i never censor anything other than spam or obscene language.
i don't care that it's noisy.
we can't shoot with the same lens on both cameras, at least not with the lens selection we had available that day.
i mention this because the day before he arrived in toronto i took delivery of thecanon 1ds mkiii that i had ordered after my madagascar shoot, where i took some some 5,500 frames with a pre-production mkiiis.
i know that if we did the test with one camera at a settable iso and the other boosted i'd hear no end of it.
put aside the use of different lenses and the different sensor resolutions and just look at the noise and iq characteristics.

compare the nikon d3 and the canon 1ds mkiii, especially at high iso, since the buzz about the new nikon is its claimed very low noise capability at high iso ( up to iso 25,600).
but now with the d3 nikon has upped the ante, producing a camera that appears to offer lower noise than canon (at least against the flagship 1ds mkiii), and higher available speeds as well.

the nikon doesn't go into a boost mode until above iso 6400.
a higher megapixel full frame chip is absolutely inevitable, and the d300's noise characteristics may give us a hint at what to expect from a higher resolution d3 sensor.
whichever way i do it someone in the online world with greater tribal loyalties than common sense will get pissed off and claim foul, so i'll just do a test that satisfies my curiosity, and people can natter about it one way or the other if they wish.

nikon d300 @ iso 1600, 100% enlargement sad to say, it's not in the same low noise league as either the d3 or the 1ds mkiii.
i also thought it worth throwing the d300 into this comparison because clearly the d3 is not the end of the road for nikon's flagship camera line.
