best of all, it doesn't seem to share other dslrs' tendencies to overexpose in high contrast situations.
resolution, body and controls canon's t3i has 18mp of resolution compared to nikon's 16.2mp.
in these modes, the controller only allows for moving the af-point around its nine points.

they're both sturdy little cameras, and they feel substantial.
the t3i has a four-way controller (which is a little on the small side), giving access towhite balance, focus, drive modes, and picture styles.
i'll take a look at the key points on each camera to help you make a more informed decision.
however, the t3i yet again has canon's trademark problems in coping with artificial light when using auto white balance, as images are distinctly orange.
both cameras have their plus points though, and users are unlikely to be disappointed by either machine.
it also has better dynamic range and color depth than the canon.

the only place where the canon falls down on controls is in the inexplicable change of functionsÂ of the 4-way controller once the camera is in live view or movie mode.
there's also a dedicated button foriso, something which the nikon d5100 is lacking.
if you're not tied into a system, the choice of cameras can seem bewildering.
while both cameras produce great images, the d5100 is just a little bit better in most respects.

when it comes to controls and ease of use, i feel that the canon is still yards ahead of the nikon.

in conclusion i personally find the layout and control system of the nikon confusing and somewhat lacking in key areas.

the canon produces excellent images in bothraw and jpeg formats, and it copes very well at high isos, offering users the option to reduce noise to their own set trade-offs against image detail and quality.
the canon's hand grip is perhaps marginally easier to use, but both cameras have articulated lcd screens.

however, image quality is where it counts, so, if you're new to digital cameras, then the nikon has the edge.

existing nikon users will also be confused by the re-design of control layout on the d5100 due to the articulated lcd screen.

however, the nikon'saf points are part of a far more sophisticated system than the canon's.
the t3i is also more prone to chromatic aberration than the d5100.

autofocus and af points both cameras have solid and reliable autofocus, although the nikon's speed is reliant on whatever lens you're using, as it has no in-body autofocus motor.
