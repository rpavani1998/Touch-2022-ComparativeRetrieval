it can even detect human faces when you're using the viewfinder, not live view, and it feeds into the d800's advanced scene recognition system to make metering even more foolproof.it's standard practice for medium-format cameras and it makes ultra-fine detail even sharper, though you will need to use software filters to remove moire effects in shots with fine, regular patterns, like fabrics.it can now focus down to a light level of -2ev and it still offers 11 af points even with lenses with a maximum aperture of f8.do not submit anything which may violate theterms of use or another person's rights including copyrighted or offensive materials.but the d800 steams in with multiple frame sizes for different focal length and depth of field effects, a 60p/50p 1280 x 720 slo-mo mode, clean, uncompressed hdmi output and the thing videographers have been screaming for in a d-slr - an audio jack for monitoring sound while filming.medium-format quality there's more to medium-format than pixels - the sensor size makes a major difference too.the d800 is £2,400 while the eos 5d mark ii can be found for around £1,700, but that's because it's an older camera that's being discounted.what's significant is that the eos 1d x costs more than the d4, so if that pattern is repeated, the eos 5d mark ii replacement will cost more than the d800.the d800 has two card slots, one for cf (udma 7 compatible) and one for sd/sdhc/sdxc, and you can use them for extra capacity, backups, one for jpegs and one for raw and so on.current eos 5d mark iii rumours predict either 19 af points, like the eos 7d, or the eos-1dx's 61-point system, but even that can't match the d800's low-light/small aperture af capabilities.there's more to medium-format than pixels - the sensor size makes a major difference too.even so, the d800's brand new 91k-pixel metering sensor sounds impressive.rod lawton is nphoto's technique editor, so obviously he's biased towards nikons.canon did usher in a new 100,000k-pixel sensor with thecanon eos 1dx, though.correction: the canon 1dx does not have a 100,000k-pixel metering sensor.
