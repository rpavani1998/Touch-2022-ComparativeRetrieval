the nikon d3s offers class leading performance at high iso settings, and features excellent dynamic range.the image quality produced by it is also superb, with vibrant punchy colours and low noise compared to many other cameras available today.advances in sensor technology in the last year or so have produced cameras that are able to take images in incredibly difficult condition, at very high sensitivities, that just wouldn't have been possible with film.both are capable of producing superb quality images in the right hands, both are superbly built and both handle really well.nikon's 14-24mm f/2.8 lens has garnered a superb reputation and is perfect for getting in close to the action.image quality both cameras produce images of excellent quality in decent conditions, with images straight from the canon having a more vivid appearance when the standard picture style is used.pushing the sensitivity beyond the camera's native range results in visibly higher levels of noise and loss of fine detail, although shots taken at iso25600 still keep chroma noise to levels which aren't too disturbing, which is excellent performance for such a high iso and images at this setting should be fine for reproduction in less critical applications, such as for the web, or at small sizes in newspapers or magazines.canon's auto iso is very simple, providing a shutter speed that is safe for hand-holding the camera where possible in aperture priority and program modes, and the give the correctly metered exposure in shutter priority and manual modes.also, the lower resolution of the nikon, coupled with the larger sensor size results in larger photosites on the sensor, which should also result in better noise performance at high iso sensitivities.quick exposure compensation adjustments can be applied in either shutter or aperture priority modes by turning the rear dial, which is excellent for shooting under rapidly changing conditions.as far as handling is concerned, both cameras feel excellent to use and are built to exceptionally high standards.most lenses will give good optical performance when stopped down.the canon eos 1d mkiv makes a compelling argument for itself, and offers exceptional performance.for example, the canon has a slightly higher resolution sensor, is slightly lighter and has a higher resolution video mode, whereas the nikon is capable of shooting at higher speeds in dx crop mode, and has a marginally higher resolution screen.pushing the camera beyond its native sensitivity range results in visible softening and loss of colour saturation due to the noise reduction making every attempt to control chroma noise levels.
