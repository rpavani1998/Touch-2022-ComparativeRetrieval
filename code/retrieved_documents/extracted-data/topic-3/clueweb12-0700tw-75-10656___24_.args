although resolution is almost unchanged, it now features eight-channel readout, gapless microlenses, and boasts improvements in transistor structure and on-chip noise reduction that should yield improved image quality, even for raw shooters.the system is the result of two technologies: a high-sensitivity imaging sensor that's able to capture more light and canon's digic image processor, which actively reduces noise with high-speed image processing, delivering maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas.the original 5d's 12.8-megapixel full-frame sensor produced legendary image quality, and the 5d mark ii raised the resolution to 21.1 megapixels and added superb video quality to the mix, creating a sensation in video production.as well as enabling faster 6 fps burst shooting, there's also more power for noise reduction, and canon is predicting a two-stop improvement for jpeg shooting.this full-color metering allows better subject detection, information which is also fed back to the autofocus system to further aid subject tracking.the 5d mark iii's viewfinder now has 100% coverage and a 22mm eyepoint, both slightly upgraded from the previous model.noise and noise suppression continue to mar the sony a77's images at iso 3,200, with a slight loss of color as well.the canon 5d mark iii raises the game in terms of overall camera performance, from frame rate to autofocus, while increasing the resolution only slightly (by just over a million pixels to 22.3-megapixels).we'll go over the other features in more detail below, but the canon 5d mark iii also includes a 150,000-cycle shutter rating; a new hdr mode; full hd, 1080p video at 24, 25, and 30 frames per second; a 3.2-inch, 1.04m-dot lcd; a new cmos sensor with higher sensitivity and an eight-channel readout that allows a 6-frame-per-second frame rate; a quick control dial that includes touch capability for silent adjustments while in video mode; multiple raw image sizes; 100-percent viewfinder coverage with an adjustable lcd grid and af overlay; a 1.5 percent spot meter; a dual-axis leveling system; and standard or quiet operation modes.as well as supporting new features of the camera, it adds a digital lens optimizer function for still images.the superior resolution of the sony a77 is lost a bit to noise suppression in the smaller sensor, particularly noticeable in the shadows and the dark mosaic background.a 'silent' shooting mode reduces operation noise, but reduces burst-shooting speed to three frames per second.canon 5d mark iii versus sony a77 at iso 3,200 canon 5d mark iii at iso 3,200 sony a77 at iso 3,200 noise and noise suppression continue to mar the sony a77's images at iso 3,200, with a slight loss of color as well.although the target market is clearly experienced photographers, the 5d mark iii caters to the occasional time when you want to lend your camera to a less-experienced photographer, perhaps to get in the shot yourself.the full auto mode has been upgraded, and canon says it will now do a better job of recognizing the appropriate scene type.
