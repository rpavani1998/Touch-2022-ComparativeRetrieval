as digital projection becomes more prevalent, projection frame rate might become a creative choice.they are targeting at normal consumers who just want to point and shoot without getting into technics, or the cameras are so much expensive, that they are out of questions for low budget filmmaking.i almost exclusively see my hollywood movies at digital theatres--the quality is easily superior and doesn't degrade over time.most of the camcorders, they produce for an affordable price lack of nice manual control or other options which are important for being creative.don't get me wrong, it's preferable for filmmaking, but i think 35mm dof is far more impactful on cinematic storytelling than the perceived difference between 24p and 30p.the nikon uses a really low bitrate (averaging somewhere between 11-20mbs) on a much less efficient "nice intra-frame compression" system.it makes editing and final quality much harder than it should be."it's still not "live" looking and can feel filmic, in terms of being "cinematic".right here in salt lake city, a good deal of theatres have switched to all digital projection, which could easily accomodate 30p content.when we shot 35mm film in still cameras and 35mm in motion cameras, we did not expect to have one camera to shoot stills and motion.it's disappointing that it isn't the big bang camera every indie dreams of, but it's also a nice indicator of things to come.the 5d mkii has been officially announced, and the features match most of what was rumored, including a 1080p movie mode.based on some d90 footage i've seen recently which shows how evil the "rolling shutter" artifacts can be, i'm not totally convinced that dslrs are the best option for indie filmmaking (and especially in cases with camera tracking for vfx).canon should have done the right thing: selectable frame rates at exactly 29.97, 25.00, 24.00 and 23.976.learning to do lock down setups may prove to be a great experience, so when we get to a non shearing image dslr we will have learned the fine art of less is more.
