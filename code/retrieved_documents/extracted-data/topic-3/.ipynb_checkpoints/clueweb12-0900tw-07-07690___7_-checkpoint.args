the cameras (no matter what brand), for all intents and purposes, take fantastic images if used correctly.these two lenses were selected because they fall in line with my shooting style and fondness for prime lenses.paired with the 7d, the camera gave my images a great softness when shot wide open and the colors were rendered very well.it is a piece of equipment there to help explain visually: textures, structures, living forms, explosion, eruptions, the earth itself.photographers must find which cameras they are most comfortable with, that is all.finding the shutter, aperture, exposure compensation, and iso eventually become second nature.i totally agree agree with you: a skilled photographer can produce excellent picture regardless of the brand of the camera.the camera has great form and function.this camera would work well in pretty much any style of photography.the effect of the camera on me was mind blowing especially with thecanon 35mm f1.4 and the canon 50mm f1.4.the canon 7d has been added to the long list of cameras i have had the honor of playing with here on the phoblographer and the images are produced ’with the camera by me’, not ‘by the camera’.shooting with the 7d was so good and so refreshing and made me feel right at home.the 35mm f1.4 and the 50mm f1.4 were perfect for coffee photography.however if i did not have and understanding of photography fundamentals, i would not be able to use most of them at all.compared to the nikon d90, thed7000, d300, and the d700 (my preferred camera bodies) the camera is a complete joy to hold.
