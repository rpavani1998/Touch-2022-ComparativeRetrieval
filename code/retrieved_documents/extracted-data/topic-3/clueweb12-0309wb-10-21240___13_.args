this opens up a huge range of creative opportunities that are unavailable to most users of 35mm and medium format gear.the best digital cameras offer comparable image quality, instant previewing, and near-instant sharing via the internet.these are extremely versatile instruments in the right hands and can take beautiful pictures if used with care.the 35mm slr is a 50-year-old technology, the market is quite competitive, and the systems have become rather similar.finally, nikon and canon are probably the lowest cost systems for serious photographers because they have high resale value and economies of scale on the big lenses (e.g., a nikon 80-200/2.8 costs less than a pentax 80-200/2.8 because the nikon is mass-produced for photojournalists whereas only a handful of pentax's customers are in the market for lenses that cost over $1000).this was fast enough to permit available-light photography and freed the student to think about composition rather than where to set the zoom on a zoom lens.another advantage of having used a view camera is that it gives you an understanding of perspective.there are good reasons for this and the dominance tends to be self-perpetuating because off-brand manufacturers don't have much incentive to invest in r&d.most people don't realize that their p&s cameras have exposure and focus lock (press halfway down), the same reliable flash exposure control system as a new nikon (and therefore better than a $1500 canon eos-1n), and can give great results on a tripod.to produce a physical image you could buy and learn how to use a high-quality ink-jet or fujix printer.the less obvious problem with digital cameras is that they force the photographer into a world of computer pain.a lens for a canon eos film camera must project a large enough image to cover the 24mmx36mm frame of 35mm film.and the automated features may prove useful later in the student's photographic career.those under $1000 are aimed at point-and-shooters and people accustomed to slrs will be disappointed in the lack the creative freedom and tiny viewfinders.it is much better to have a good lens on a cheap body than vice versa.
