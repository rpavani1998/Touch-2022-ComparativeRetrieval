the first method is based on encoding rule sets with bit string genomes and the second one utilizes genetic programming to create decision trees with arbitrary expressions attached to the nodes.

comparisons with some sophisticated standard approaches, such as c4.5 and random-forest, show that the performance of the evolved classifiers can be very competitive.
