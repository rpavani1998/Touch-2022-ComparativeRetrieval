the results of our experiments show that the proposed approach has a comparable performance to that of random forests, with the added advantage of being applicable to any base-level algorithm without the need to randomize the latter.

the results of our experiments show that the proposed approach has a comparable performance to that of random forests, with the added advantage of being applicable to any base-level algorithm without the need to randomize the latter.
they derive their strength from two aspects: using random subsamples of the training data (as in bagging) and randomizing the algorithm for learning base-level classifiers (decision trees).
