although we can make recommendations as to which splitting rule is best suited to which type of problem, it is good practice to always use several splitting rules and compare the results.
variations on twoing an important variation of the twoing rule is power-modified twoing, which places an even heavier weight on splitting the data in a node into two equal-sized partitions.
with multiple classes, you might care how the errors are distributed across classes.
unfortunately, previous examinations of splitting rule performance, the ones that found no differences, did not look at data-mining problems with large data sets where obtaining a good answer is genuinely difficult.
while imperfect, it is still an unusually accurate tree.
as you work with different types of data and problems, you will begin to learn which splitting rules typically work best for specific problem types.
in this example of vehicle choice, the twoing rule was the winner; in other data sets, the winner might be power-modified twoing, gini, or yet another rule.
if the purpose of a decision tree is to yield insight into a causal process or into the structure of a database, splitting rules of similar accuracy can yield trees that vary greatly in their usefulness for interpreting and understanding the data.

for target variables with four to nine levels, twoing has a good chance of being the best splitting rule.
once the first split is made, gini continues attempting to split the data that require further segmentation, i.e., the right child node that contains classes b, c and d. using the same strategy, gini attempts to pull out all the class b records, separating them from the other classes in the node.
a data-mining project concerning consumer choice from a set of 28 vehicles is a typical example of the substantial differences that can be observed across alternative splitting rules.
in such circumstances, the difference between gini and twoing could easily be the difference between success and failure (e.g., in the case of fraud detection).
as you work with different types of data and problems, you will begin to learn which splitting rules typically work best for specific problem types.
it will always favor working on the largest or, if you use costs or weights, the most "important" class in a node.
although the second tree also has quite a high error rate in percentage of error terms, it is a dramatic improvement over the first.

when you are trying to detect fraud, identify borrowers who will declare bankruptcy in the next 12 months, target a direct mail campaign, or tackle other real-world business problems that do not admit of 90+ percent accuracy rates (with currently available data), the splitting rule you choose could materially affect the accuracy and value of your decision tree.
further, even when different splitting rules yield similarly accurate classifiers, the differences between them may still matter.
contrary to popular opinion in data mining circles, our experience indicates that splitting criteria do matter; in fact, the difference between using the right rule and the wrong rule could add up to millions of dollars of lost opportunity.
for example, with four classes, a, b, c, and d, representing 40, 30, 20, and 10 percent of the data, respectively, the gini rule would immediately attempt to pull out the class a records into one node.

there will also be times when the value of a decision tree is determined by how rich the best nodes are in certain values of the target variable, and the overall accuracy of the tree is irrelevant.
a data-mining project concerning consumer choice from a set of 28 vehicles is a typical example of the substantial differences that can be observed across alternative splitting rules.
rather than initially pulling out a single class, twoing first segments the classes into two groups, attempting to find groups that together add up to 50 percent of the data.
general rules of thumb the following rules of thumb are based on our experience in the telecommunications, banking, and market research arenas, and may not apply literally to other subject matters or even other data sets.
the second run, using cart's twoing rule, grew a tree with 50 nodes with a relative error of 0.876.
therefore, we cannot expect to grow trees like the one above routinely; however, gini will try to come as close as possible to this ideal.
if they were, no one would ever receive an unwelcome direct mail piece and bank losses on bad debts would be zero.
reviewing the tree sequences below, one can see that the twoing rule makes a better first split and continues to pull ahead of gini on progressively larger trees.

when your golf ball is one inch from the cup, which club or even which end you use is not important because you will be able to sink the ball in one stroke.

reviewing the tree sequences below, one can see that the twoing rule makes a better first split and continues to pull ahead of gini on progressively larger trees.
given that there is no one best splitting rule for all problem types or all purposes, it is important that the decision-tree tool you employ offer several proven splitting rules with distinct styles and operating characteristics.
the second run, using cart's twoing rule, grew a tree with 50 nodes with a relative error of 0.876.
even when the overall accuracy of two trees grown by different splitting rules is identical, the usefulness of the trees for revealing data structure can be quite different.
gini then tackles the last heterogeneous node, striving to separate class c from class d. if the gini rule is successful, the final tree would contain four "pure" child nodes: a pure decision tree such as the above is attainable only in very rare circumstances; in most real world applications, database fields that clearly partition class from class are not available.
while this approach might seem short sighted, gini performance is frequently so good that you should always experiment with it to see how well it does.
when only imperfect partitions are available, power-modified twoing is more likely to generate a near 50-50 partition of the data than is simple twoing.
once the first split is made, gini continues attempting to split the data that require further segmentation, i.e., the right child node that contains classes b, c and d. using the same strategy, gini attempts to pull out all the class b records, separating them from the other classes in the node.
for target variables with four to nine levels, twoing has a good chance of being the best splitting rule.
the list of variables in this exercise was quite limited; in particular, the trees needed to be grown without reference to important drivers of choice such as income or price, so the level of accuracy attainable was expected to be low.

gini splitting rule gini looks for the largest class in your database (e.g., class a) and strives to isolate it from all other classes.
