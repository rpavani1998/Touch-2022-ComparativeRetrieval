indeed, writing a computer program is essentially about building a model.
as we learn more about the new complex idea we change our model to better reflect the idea, until eventually we have a model that matches the idea enough for us to make good effect of our understanding of the idea.
we can think of the discovered knowledge, or the model, as being expressed as sentences in a language.

once we have some basic models we can start to get ideas about more complex models, building on what has come before.

in understanding new complex ideas we often begin by trying to map the idea into concepts or constructs that we already know, by bringing those constructs together in different ways that reflect how we understand the new complex idea.

but even more than that, our models are often useful to give us guidance in how to deal with and interact with the real world!
in this section we present a framework within which we cast the task of data mining--the task being model building.

in essence, the model builders differ in how they represent the models they build (i.e., the discovered knowledge) and how they find (or search for) the best model within this representation.
