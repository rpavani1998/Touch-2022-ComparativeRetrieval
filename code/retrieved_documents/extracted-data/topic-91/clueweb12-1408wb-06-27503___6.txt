those entites in the training data which the model was  unable to capture (i.e., the model mis-classifies those entites) have their  weights boosted.
the final model is then an additive model constructed  from the sequence of models, each model's output weighted by some score.
those entites in the training data which the model was unable to capture (i.e., the model mis-classifies those entites) have their weights boosted.
boosting builds a collection of models using a ``weak learner'' and  thereby reduces misclassification error, bias, and variance (, ,).

the result is then a panel of models used to make a decision on new data by combining the ``expertise'' of each model in such a way that the more accurate experts carry more weight.
a weak learning algorithm is one that is only somewhat better than random guessing in terms of error rates (i.e., the error rate is just below 50%).
