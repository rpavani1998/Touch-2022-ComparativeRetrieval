the experimental results show that these algorithms perform competitively with previously published results for the datasets used, while often exhibiting lower runtime than other tested systems.this demonstrates that sufficient information for classification and clustering is retained in the rule generation process and that learning with random rules is efficient.the new algorithms are shown to achieve better root mean squared error rates than existing approaches on artificial data generated according to the underlying assumptions.they offer the advantage to provide sound, probabilistic scores.propositionalisation allows single-table algorithms for classification and clustering to be applied to the resulting data, reducing the amount of relational processing required.further results show that techniques for utilising additional unlabeled training data improve accuracy of classification in the semi-supervised setting.randomization based on random relational rules can work both with and without a class attribute and can therefore be applied simultaneously to both the labeled and the unlabeled portion of the data present in semi-supervised learning.this allows the classification process to inherently take into account correlations between labels.in this paper we investigate an approach to semi-supervised learning based on randomized propositionalization, which allows for applying standard propositional classification algorithms like support vector machines to multi-relational data.continuous learning is able to improve the performance achieved with static models but the rate of improvement drops over time and the computer player is still unable to beat the opponent.this indicates a need for algorithms that can operate efficiently on relational data and exploit the larger body of work produced in the area of single-table techniques.the assumption is that random rules enable efficient and effective relational learning, and this thesis presents evidence that this is indeed the case.reinforcement learning methods have the highest rate of improvement but the lowest initial performance.to this end we first identify a way of performing a fair comparison between the techniques concerned and present an adaptation of standard cross-validation.in this paper, we hope to stimulate the development of such learning experiment repositories by providing a bird's-eye view of how they can be created and used in practice, bringing together existing approaches and new ideas.
