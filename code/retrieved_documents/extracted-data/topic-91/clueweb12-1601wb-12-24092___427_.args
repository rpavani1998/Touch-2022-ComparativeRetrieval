classifier systems are well tested vehicles for implementing genetic algorithms in machine learning environments.our results indicate that inaccurate over-general classifiers can interact with the classifier-generation mechanisms to cause catastrophic breakdowns in overall system performance.learning classifier systems represent a potentially useful tool that combines the transparency of symbolic approaches (such as decision trees) with the learning ability of connectionist approaches (such as artificial neural networks) to machine learning.recent advances in xcs technology have shown that self-adaptive mutation can be highly useful to speed-up the evolutionary progress in xcs.genetic algorithms (ga) have shown great promise on complex search domains, and hence suggest a means for overcoming these limitations.these networks have been integrated with a classifier system to produce a hybrid learning system (hls) that exhibits adaptive behaviour when driven by low level environmental feedback.message-passing, rule-based production systems in which many rules are active simultaneously offer attractive possibilities for the exploitation of general-purpose machine learning algorithms.the quality of a set of classifiers and consequently also the optimal set of classifiers is defined by the application of bayesian model selection, which turns finding this set into a principled optimisation task.this novel technique is theoretically shown to be approximately equivalent to, and empirically demonstrated to perform at least as well as eligibility traces, while it gives impressive computational savings.classifier systems are designed to absorb new information continuously from such environments, devising sets of competing hypotheses (expressed as rules) without disturbing significantly capabilities already acquired.results show that although simple classifier systems can capture qualitatively results from humans, they fail to show elegant solutions to problems and are limited in the tasks they can model.it has been shown that xcsf solves function approximation problems with an accuracy, noise robustness, and generalization capability comparable to other statistical machine learning techniques and that xcsf outperforms simple clustering techniques to which linear approximations are added.the results obtained so far suggest that genetic search may be a valuable alternative to logic-based approaches to learning concepts, when no (or little) a priori knowledge is available and a very large hypothesis space has to be explored.it has been shown empirically that the xcs classifier system solves typical classification problems in a machine learning competitive way.these encodings give classifier systems the ability to represent ordinal and nominal attributes as expressively as most symbolic machine learning systems, without sacrificing the building blocks required by the genetic algorithm.
