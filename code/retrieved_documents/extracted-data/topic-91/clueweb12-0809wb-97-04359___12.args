we also assessed the degree to which real gene expression data fits the multivariate gaussian mixture assumptions on several common data transformations.
one main advantage of our approach is the ability to automatically select the number of clusters present in the document collection via bayes factors.

furthermore, these results also suggested that there is a trade-off between weak dependence and expected margins: to compensate for low expected margins, there should be low mutual dependence among the classifiers making up the combination.
in it we benchmarked the performance of model-based clustering on several synthetic and real gene expression data sets for which external validation were available.
a key advantage of model-based refractionation over other competing clustering of large data sets approaches is that it does not require the number of clusters be known a priori.
in the absence of such techniques, efficient and reliable clustering methods whose score functions are based on similarity or distance matrices are advantageous.
i showed that if both this dependence is low and the expected margins are large, then decision rules based on linear combinations of these classifiers can achieve error rates that decrease exponentially fast.
amit, y. and murua, a. (2001), "speech recognition using randomized relational decision trees," ieee transactions on speech and audio processing, 9, 333-341.. in this work we recognized speech signals using a large collection of coarse acoustic events which describe temporal relations between a few local cues in the spectrogram.
this latter procedure proved successful even when dealing with di cult situations comprising sets with large numbers of small clusters.
this research is partly based on the belief that the key to the success of modeling complex data structures lies in the embedding of kernel-based methods within parametric and bayesian models.
the main idea is to reduce the data size by working with meta-data form by clusters of data points.
however to the best of our knowledge kernels have not been used in mixture models.
in particular, the link between the potts and the random cluster model models allows us to elucidate, using random graph theory, a very informative prior for the temperature parameter.

it uses these two findings to present a powerful kernel-based clustering methodology based on potts model, kernel density estimation, and consensus clustering.
murua alejandro research the goal of every clustering (or unsupervised classification) method is to estimate the "true" clustering structure or partition underlying the feature space.
kernel methods and their extensions such as kernel k-means, multiway normalized cut (mncut), and, recently, adaptive potts model clustering use the similarity matrix information in an effective way, often yielding good results.
this latter procedure proved successful even when dealing with di cult situations comprising sets with large numbers of small clusters.
several experiments showed that the three common methods used to construct multiple classifiers from the same training data -bagging, boosting and randomized trees (random forests)- produce mutually weakly dependent trees.
we showed that suitable chosen transformations can greatly enhance normality in gene expression data, and that models have varying performance on data sets that are transformed di erently.
the goal is to facilitate bayesian inference techniques to a larger audience than just statisticians in academia.

sound machine learning and statistical methods for variable selection and/or data reduction based on the intrinsic structure of the data are needed.
we showed that on real gene expression data model-based clustering performed as well as leading heuristic clustering methods.

note that one of the main di culties with genome data is the usually small sample size together with the high-dimensionality of the data.

a comparison with other popular classification methods such as support vector machines, shows that our method is very competitive and computationally efficient.

they o er a flexibility in the modeling process through the kernel trick which enables capturing interesting features in some cases more easily than just using the standard methods.
for example, the bayesian parametric paradigm gives a framework for introducing structural constraints, whereas the kernel based methods introduces flexibility (e.g. local, spatial and/or temporal adaptation).

the invariance to changes in duration of speech signal events was addressed by defining temporal relations in a rather coarse manner, allowing a large degree of slack.
