stochastic discrimination, random forests and boosting tend to form more accurate classifiers than decision trees alone, since they are able to better capture the true structure of the data.
the weak classifiers are assigned at random and checked to see if they conform to: encouragement (they predict better than 50%) thickness (they generalise to new examples in the class) non-special (adjustments to equalise coverage of easy and hard-to-classify points) a similar technique, which is an example of stochastic discrimination but was invented separately by leo breiman, is 'random forests'.
if dealing with cars, for instance, the label might be 'price' with features such as colour, weight, manufacturer or type.
if there is no label, the task might be to cluster the data into like groups.
the ideal is top-down management harvesting of bottom-up results; after all, this is a profit centre.

otherwise, the organisation will be subject to untapped losses, unpredicted equipment failures and slower diagnostics.
the data is fed back in to see how bad the predictive performance is.
note that in bayesian networks causality is directed but signals flow both ways (wet grass means that it is more likely that rain occurred).
so, the cut-off point is divided down the tree, reusing feature variables as necessary, until the data in the 'leaves' is pure, or within a small percentage of being so.
statistical boosting"bayesian networks use conditional independence to factor a distribution, resulting in large memory and computational savings."
using the importance variable method, these classifiers can be used in place of single trees and still find important dependencies in the data.
alternatively, one of the features can be selected as a label and the remaining features used to learn and predict that label.
techniques "decision trees and dependency networks have the greatest range of usability, since trees handle mixed data types, as well as missing and hidden variables.

the potential applications of bayesian networks in semiconductor manufacturing are vast, but greatest in the introduction of cost-based decision-making influence diagrams.
good manufacturing applications might be: predicting machine failure and which components will turn out well (and can undergo reduced testing); finding multiple causes of failure; and diagnosing causes of failure.
statistics can only express correlation (for example, rain and wet grass occur together) while bayesian networks express the causality (rain > wet grass).
classification and regression trees (cart)"manufacturing management must create a top-down push for end-to-end use of machine learning and allow a bottom-up initiative to find specific applications."
bayesian networks may also be seen as circuit diagrams of probability models.
the main difficulties lie in collecting and organising the data that these routines need, and diffusing knowledge of them throughout the organisation.
the payoffs will easily exceed the effort put in.
after training the classifier, each feature is taken in turn and randomly permuted.

the trees then get an equal vote on the point's class.
the software cited offers many ways of solving, approximating and learning bayesian networks.
with the explosion in internal and external networks, which allow the pooling of data, advantages such as cost savings, sophisticated trouble-shooting and automatic diagnostics are available with even the simplest applications.

svms can be powerful prediction and classification machines.
for example, to divide cars into a high-mileage and low-mileage group, he best split variable might be weight (with two tonnes and over being the cut-off point).
typically, there is a 'training set' of data that can be used to learn the classifier responses or establish the categories.
this has produced mature tools that will return multiples of the time and money spent learning them: binary decision trees (cart, c4.5) and their statistically boosted variants (adaboost, mart, random forests); discrete graphical models in the form of diagnostic networks and influence diagrams; and support vector machines for prediction and feature selection.
stopping at a split level that is too high in the tree will lead to 'underfitting'.
