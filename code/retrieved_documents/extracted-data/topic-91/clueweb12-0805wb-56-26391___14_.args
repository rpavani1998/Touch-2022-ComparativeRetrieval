accurate prediction of benthic biomass can facilitate ecosystem based management (ebm) on socioeconomically important species[90].as a result, standing stock biomass has been used as a surrogate for biomass production and carbon flow to and through an ecosystem, without necessarily defining the taxa contributing to the biomass.rf is robust to outlier and unbalanced data, making it a better choice than traditional statistical methods[12].predictive mapping of this kind can fill the gaps where critical biomass information is lacking, since a true ‘census’ of global living carbon is expensive and practically impossible.the shift of biomass dominance groups with depth is shown to be affected by the decrease in average body size rather than abundance, presumably due to decrease in quantity and quality of food supply.this biomass census and associated maps are vital components of mechanistic deep-sea food web models and global carbon cycling, and as such provide fundamental information that can be incorporated into evidence-based management.predictive accuracy requires low bias and low correlation between decision trees[11].unlike traditional rta, the rf algorithm searches the best split from a random subset of predictors (1/3 of all variables) and the prediction can be made from new data (environmental) by averaging the model outputs of all trees.the machine-learning algorithm, random forests, was employed to model and predict seafloor standing stocks from surface primary production, water-column integrated and export particulate organic matter (pom), seafloor relief, and bottom water properties.it is also extremely useful for generating and testing large scale hypotheses (e.g. latitudinal and cross-basin comparison) and planning shipboard surveys.the predictive models explain 63% to 88% of stock variance among the major size groups.on the other hand, by analyzing the statistical relationships of diversity to biomass, it might be possible to make some practical inferences about the effects that productivity might have on diversity[1], as this is an open question that has generated considerable conjecture[2].a biomass census therefore has relevance to societies because human populations are putting a ‘tax’ on the ocean biota in the form of valuable protein in fisheries products.applying such equations is conceptually intuitive but the relationships tend sometimes to fall apart in large scale predictive mapping.each tree is grown from a bootstrap sample of response variable and each node is guided by a predictor value to maximize differences in offspring branches.
