the results of our experiments show that the  proposed approach has a comparable performance to that of random forests, with  the added advantage of being applicable to any base-level algorithm without the  need to randomize the latter.

the base-level algorithm randomly  selects a subset of the features at each step of tree construction and chooses  the best among these.

the latter randomly  select a subset of the features at the start and use a deterministic version of  the base-level algorithm (and is thus somewhat similar to the randomized  version of the algorithm).

the results of our experiments show that the proposed approach has a comparable performance to that of random forests, with the added advantage of being applicable to any base-level algorithm without the need to randomize the latter.
the latter randomly select a subset of the features at the start and use a deterministic version of the base-level algorithm (and is thus somewhat similar to the randomized version of the algorithm).
they derive their strength from two aspects: using random subsamples of the training data (as in bagging) and randomizing the algorithm for learning base-level classifiers (decision trees).
