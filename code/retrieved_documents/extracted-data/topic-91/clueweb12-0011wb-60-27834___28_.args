future work to more closely integrate a user's email environment with their browser could alleviate these problems, and would actually provide a potentially richer context in which to make a decision.for almost all of the high-performing classifiers, the difference in accuracy is not statistically significant, and none are statistically significantly better.we also prevent the loss of productivity suffered by a user who has to take time to read, process, and delete these attack emails.looking farther into the future, deeper knowledge-based models of the user and the types of prior relationships she may or may not have with different sites or organizations could also help fend off more sophisticated phishing attacks.this combination of information is then used as the input to a classifier, the result of which is a decision on whether the input contained data designed to deceive the user.we present a method for detecting these attacks, which in its most general form is an application of machine learning on a feature set designed to highlight user-targeted deception in electronic communication.at this point, however, we are able to obtain high accuracy with only ten features, which makes the decision boundaries less complex, and therefore both more intuitive and faster to evaluate.this method is applicable, with slight modification, to detection of phishing websites, or the emails used to direct victims to these sites.this might not be optimal, but it makes parsing much simpler, especially when dealing with attacks that contain malformed html.some number of users fall for these attacks by providing the requested information, which can lead to fraudulent charges against credit cards, withdrawals from bank accounts, or other undesirable effects.as the phishing attacks evolve over time to employ alternate deceptive behaviors, so does the information available to combat these attacks.as the nature of phishing attacks changes, additional features may become more powerful, and pilfer can easily be adapted by providing such new features to the classifier.while pilfer without the spam filter's input has comparable accuracy to the spam filter, the accuracy obtained by providing the spam filter's decision as an input to pilfer, i.e. the combination of the two, improves the accuracy to be much better than either one alone.as such, it is our belief that to stop phishing emails, we need to look at features selected specifically to detect this class of emails.in this paper, we have shown that it is possible to detect phishing emails with high accuracy by using a specialized filter,
