breiman (1997) showed that this algorithm is a form of gradient optimization in function space with the goal of minimizing the objective function the quantity yih(xi) is called the margin , because it is the amount by whichxi is correctly classified.
dietterich and bakiri (1995) report that this technique improves the performance of both decision-tree and backpropagation learning algorithms on a variety of difficult classification problems.
the primary exception are data sets in which there is a high level of mislabeled training data points.
experimentally, adaboost has been shown to be very effective at increasing the margins on the training data points; this result suggests that adaboost will make few errors on new data points.

recent experiments suggest that breiman’s combination of bagging and the random subspace method is the method of choice for decision trees: it gives excellent accuracy and works well even when there is substantial noise in the training data.
for example, in a project to identify volcanoes on venus, cherkauer (1996) trained an ensemble of 32 neural networks.
consequently, ensembles of decision tree classifiers perform much better than individual decision trees.

there is a risk that the chosen hypothesis will not predict future data points well.
the nearest neighbor algorithm does not satisfy this constraint, because it merely identifies the training data pointxi nearest to the new point x and outputs the corresponding valueyi as the prediction for h(x ), regardless of howyi is encoded.
the quantity yih(xi) is called the margin , because it is the amount by whichxi is correctly classified.
the input data can then be relabeled so that any of the original classes in setak are given the derived label −1 and the original classes in setbk are given the derived label +1.
in addition, the base learning algorithm must be sensitive to the encoding of the output values.
this relabeled data is then given to the learning algorithm, which constructs a classifierhk.
freund and schapire (1996) showed improved performance on 22 benchmark problems, equal performance on one problem, and worse performance on four problems.
to determine which hypothesish is best, a learning algorithm can measure how well h matches f on the training data points, and it can also assess how consistenth is with any available prior knowledge about the problem.
if hk(x) = −1, then each class inak receives a vote.
hence, methods like bagging that rely on instability do not produce diverse ensembles.
the computational problem arises when the learning algorithm cannot guarantee finding the best hypothesis within the hypothesis space.
hence, by taking a weighted vote of hypotheses, the learning algorithm may be able to form a more accurate approximation tof.
experimentally, adaboost has been shown to be very effective at increasing the margins on the training data points; this result suggests that adaboost will make few errors on new data points.

in most experimental studies ( freund and schapire, 1996 ; bauer and kohavi, 1999; dietterich, 2000 ), adaboost (and algorithms based on it) gives the best performance on the vast majority of data sets.
in addition, the base learning algorithm must be sensitive to the encoding of the output values.
first, the bound is not tight, so it may be hiding the real explanation for adaboost’s success.
however, because the output coding can create difficult two-class learning problems, it is important that the base learner be very expressive.
experimental evidence has shown that ensemble methods are often much more accurate than any single hypothesis.
in all cases, these algorithms find one best hypothesis h and output it as the “solution” to the learning problem.
a third way to force diversity is to manipulate the output labels of the training data.
these heuristics (such as gradient descent) can get stuck in local minima and hence fail to find the best hypothesis.

in neural network and decision tree algorithms, for example, the task of finding the hypothesis that best fits the training data is computationally intractable, so heuristic methods must be employed.
the computational problem arises when the learning algorithm cannot guarantee finding the best hypothesis within the hypothesis space.
hence, methods like bagging that rely on instability do not produce diverse ensembles.
this work shows that the error of an ensemble on new data points is bounded by the fraction of training data points for which the margin is less than some quantity θ > 0 plus a term that grows as ignoring constant factors and some log terms.
the second approach to designing ensembles is to construct the hypotheses in a coupled fashion so that the weighted vote of the hypotheses gives a good fit to the data.
after each of the k classifiers has voted, the class with the highest number of votes is selected as the prediction of the ensemble.
decision tree learning algorithms are known to suffer from high variance, because they make a cascade of choices (of which variable and value to test at each internal node in the decision tree) such that one incorrect choice has an impact on all subsequent decisions.
this creates a resampled data set in which some data points appear multiple times and other data points do not appear at all.
as with the statistical problem, a weighted combination of several different local minima can reduce the risk of choosing the wrong local minimum to output.
decision tree algorithms can be randomized by adding randomness to the process of choosing which feature and threshold to split on.
for example, in a project to identify volcanoes on venus, cherkauer (1996) trained an ensemble of 32 neural networks.
the ensemble’s prediction is the classj whose codewordcj is closest (measured by the number of bits that agree) to the k-bit output string.
in addition, because the internal nodes of the tree test only a single variable, this creates axis-parallel rectangular decision regions that can have high bias.
given a set ofm training data points, bagging chooses in each iteration a set of data points of sizem by sampling uniformly with replacement from the original data points.
second, even when adaboost is applied to large decision trees and neural networks, it is observed to work very well even though these representations have high vc-dimension.
the goal of the learning algorithm is to find a good approximationh to f that can be applied to assign labels to newx values.
there is a risk that the chosen hypothesis will not predict future data points well.
the kth learned classifier attempts to predict bitk of these codewords (a prediction of −1 is treated as a binary value of 0).
if such an ensemble of hypotheses can be constructed, it is easy to see that it will be more accurate than any of its component classifiers, because the disagreements will cancel out.
intuitively, this formula says that if the ensemble learning algorithm can achieve a large “margin of safety” on each training data point while using only a weighted sum of simple classifiers,then the resulting voted classifier is likely to be very accurate.

a second way to force diversity is to provide a different subset of the input features in each call to the learning algorithm.
because the generalization ability of a single feedforward neural network is usually very good, neural networks benefit less from ensemble methods.
the algorithms are very stable, which means that even substantial (random) changes to the training data do not cause the learned discrimination rule to change very much.

in neural network and decision tree algorithms, for example, the task of finding the hypothesis that best fits the training data is computationally intractable,
the first approach is to construct each hypothesis independently in such a way that the resulting set of hypotheses is accurate and diverse, that is, each individual hypothesis has a reasonably low error rate for making new predictions and yet the hypotheses disagree with each other in many of their predictions.
the input data can then be relabeled so that any of the original classes in setak are given the derived label −1 and the original classes in setbk are given the derived label +1.
breiman (2001) combines bagging with the random subspace method to grow random decision forests that give excellent performance.
review of ensemble algorithms ensemble learning algorithms work by running a base learning algorithm multiple times, and forming a vote out of the resulting hypotheses.
rather than finding one best hypothesis to explain the data, they construct aset of hypotheses (sometimes called acommittee or ensemble) and then have those hypotheses “vote” in some fashion to predict the label of new data points.
this relabeled data is then given to the learning algorithm, which constructs a classifierhk.
