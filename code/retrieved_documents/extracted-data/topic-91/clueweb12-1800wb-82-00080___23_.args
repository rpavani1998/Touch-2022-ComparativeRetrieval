credit scoring has proved very successful at assessing the relative risk of individual borrowers defaulting.in particular, the lack of models for the credit risk of portfolios of consumer loans and not modelling how economic conditions affect credit scores is now recognised as having exacerbated the credit crunch of 2008/2009.this idea of building a large number of models and choosing what the majority predicts could be used with all the classification methodologies, not just classification trees.thus, one needs to build lifetime value models that can cope with the changes in economic and market conditions over long time intervals as well as forecasting the changes in the customer's situation and priorities.so, not only is it proving difficult to get reasonable estimates of lgd and rr using existing data, but building models to optimise or at least improve the collections process is likely to mean that rrs in the future will be significantly improved on those found in these data.for example, many of the newer methods essentially construct non-linear scorecards with interactions between characteristics, but experts in the linear approaches to credit scorecard building—logistic and linear regression—tend to know from experience about such interactions and allow for them by building separate scorecards for different segments of the population or by introducing interaction variables.thus, researchers are looking to see whether they can devise classification trees that mimic the performance of the 'black box' and hence give reasons for assuming the applicant is bad and should be rejected.by applying monte carlo simulation, using different future economic scenarios, one can then use such a model to estimate portfolio-level default rates.this will prove a vital tool in meeting several of the challenges outlined previously.the critical assumption in credit scoring is that the score is all that is required for predicting the probability of the applicant being good.one can do this by sensitivity analysis in which one changes the value of one of the factors that impacts on the model, or by scenario analysis.thus, one needs to build scorecards that can respond very quickly to changes in economic and market behaviour and to immediate changes in the borrower's behaviour, and circumstances.one advantage of the survival analysis approach is that the competing risk idea means that one can use the same data to estimate several different events.the assumption that credit worthiness is time independent over intervals of 3 or 4 years meant that credit scores have been built using the socio-demographic characteristics of the borrower, the credit bureau information about the borrower, details of the loan and even the repayment performance of the borrower on the loan, but not using anything about the current economic and market conditions.lenders want to use 'credit scoring' to help make these variable pricing decisions and to determine the long-term profitability of a customer under different lender actions.
