in stochastic gradient boosting, small trees, very slow learning rates, mandatory sampling from the training data, and redefinition of the target variable are all combined to produce a remarkably fast and robust learner, capable of handling both regression and classification even under fairly adverse circumstances of dirty data.breiman also introduced novel post-processing in which he uses the random forest trees to generate a non-metric distance between any two records in a data set, thus supporting new ways to cluster data and identify anomalies and outliers.fp-tree based approaches are among the leading state of the art techniques for frequent itemset mining, and the concepts have also proven useful for other patterns (sequences, episodes) and pattern types (maximal, closed).user data is randomized to disallow recovery of anything meaningful at the individual level, while still allowing recovery of aggregate information to build mining models.he followed up with stochastic gradient boosting, which generalizes boosting to a very large class of problems, eliminating the tendency of classical boosting to seriously mistrack when presented with mislabeled target data.the method combines shrinking of regression coefficients towards zero, non-uniformly allowing some coefficients to reach zero and thus accomplishing variable selection.this is done using a novel database structure, the fp-tree, which condenses the set of transactions into a form that is more compact than the original representation and amenable to a new depth-first pattern search method called fp-growth.the resulting classifications and regressions are often considerably more accurate than the bagger and are competitive with the best methods now extant.the methodology, called "mart" for multiple additive regression trees, includes visualization to convey the relationships between the target and predictors; it has been released commercially as treenet(tm).he has given strong theoretical results for many data mining problems, including association rules and frequent time sequences.this clearly indicates the quality of his work, his influence in the field, and his contributions to many topics of data mining.srikant's publications have had significant impact on the research community evidenced by their very high citations.variable selection, missing value handling, and variable transformation are all automated.his work on applications of data mining and statistical pattern recognition to massive scientific data sets in astronomy, planetary geology, and remote sensing at nasa's jet propulsion lab (jpl), california institute of technology have led to solving significant scientific advances and new discoveries in those fields.his work also introduced a new construct for analysis of ordered data, reflected in the inclusion of window functions in the sql language.
