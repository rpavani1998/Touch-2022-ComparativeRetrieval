a closer look reveals that this prediction is true for developed countries, where the volume of catch has steadily declined since 1979.
others include irrigation systems, groundwater basins, pastures and grazing systems, lakes, oceans, and the earth’s atmosphere.11 chapter 10 of the brundtland report primarily discusses the problematic condition of common-pool resources in the late 1980s; thus this update will focus on common-pool resources.
thus, policies to reduce deforestation by communities and small-scale owners may not directly affect the extent of damage in this and many other regions affected by large-scale clearing of private land driven largely by commodity markets.
the iceland itq system appears to have averted the collapse of many valuable species for the iceland fishery but has been less successful in restoring the icelandic cod stocks.
while the harvesting volume has doubled, the population of many species harvested for food has declined or disappeared.18 a basic problem leading to massive overfishing in the oceans is the lack ofany property rights for the many commercially valuable species in the open ocean.
the mea noted that the global area containing forested land has been cut in half over the past three centuries: forests have effectively disappeared in 25 countries, and another 29 have lost more than 90% of their forest cover.
while many policy analysts think that extending private ownership of a common-pool resource is an assured method for long-term sustainability, private ownership of forests does not guarantee long-term protection.
the most pressing commons problem at a global level is the need to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations substantially.
the lobster fishery also has evolved toward a monoculture that leaves it exposed to the threat of diverse ecological problems, including an epidemic among the lobster.
the specific designs of long-enduring governance regimes related to common-pool resources vary substantially from one another because of resource system diversity, as well as the social and economic settings of these resources.
without an active dialogue, the world would simply continue on the path toward an unsustainable future instead of searching for ways to avert the disaster that may ensue if we do not confront the massive overharvesting of fisheries and forests around the world, as well as the challenge of substantially reducing carbon emissions.
if the global community can apply these lessons, invest in adaptive governance, treasure institutional diversity as much as it treasures biodiversity, and see all policies as experiments that need to be evaluated over time based on new information, we may move toward a more sustainable path.
as can be seen in figure 2 of their article, 31 the percentage of eggs conserved steadily rose from the commencement of the pawikan program in the mid-1980s through the 1990s without any major conflict among participants.
in fact, findings from multiple studies of government- or community-managed forests illustrate the crucial role monitoring played in impacting the cohesiveness of institutions, as well as the success of diverse forest management initiatives.50 when harvesting rules are effectively monitored and enforced, they prevent the spread of freeriding behavior, thereby instilling a sense of trust in the community.
as of 2005, just 20 percent of the total catch is now harvested in developed-country fisheries.
the system is still evolving and faces problems related to mismatches among the temporary and spatial dimensions of the property rights assigned to diverse groups.36 in 1990, iceland also introduced an itq system after multiple crises in icelandic fishery
these problems, unless addressed, will substantially diminish the benefits that future generations obtain from ecosystems.8 thus, the most recent worldwide review of our common future warned that major changes threatened our future.
by comparison, itq systems that lack an effective monitoring system have suffered from considerable underreporting of catch levels.
the only major increases in forested areas have occurred in east asia, where china has, taken aggressive steps to reduce deforestation, and in the caribbean, where substantial urban migration has led to reforestation of the highland areas of puerto rico and the dominican republic.40
nested enterprises (for resources that are parts of larger systems).
the mea also advised that policymakers search for solutions for specific niches rather than generalized problems and avoid standardized solutions.
further, policies also have to fit with the local culture and institutional environments of those who depend on ecosystems for their livelihood.
the rights of users to devise their own institutions are not challenged by external governmental authorities, and users have long-term tenure rights to the resource.
this resurgence is due to favorable environmental conditions combined with the evolution of effective rules of diverse origins.
instead, many governments subsidized an expansion of their own national fleets, leading to increased rather than decreased fishing in coastal regions.
34 new zealand authorities found that the biological models underlying the initial allocation of permanent allocation of fixed quotas needed to be adjusted over time in light of further evidence.
fishery after fishery has been subject to massive overfishing, including the tuna and whale fisheries in the pacific, the cod fishery in the atlantic, and the lobster and conch fisheries in the caribbean.19 in 1982, the united nations conference on the law of the sea did remove around one-third of the oceans from the international realm by establishing exclusive economic zones (eezs) that extend 200 nautical miles along the oceanic borders of coastal states.
rather, the users of a commons, who are frequently widely dispersed, need to take some responsibility for monitoring.
the itq system has collected more valid data, decreased fleet overcapacity, recorded catch levels close to allocated quotas, and reduced discard of unwanted species.
as of 2005, just 20 percent of the total catch is now harvested in developed-country fisheries.
we can, however, recognize our growing capabilities and those of the individuals we study to experiment with rules, learn from the experiments, and, if the broader institutional and cultural milieu facilitates, gradually improve outcomes so they are sustainable over time.
the mea also advised that policymakers search for solutions for specific niches rather than generalized problems and avoid standardized solutions.
this resurgence is due to favorable environmental conditions combined with the evolution of effective rules of diverse origins.
designing multiple tiers of arenas that can engage in rapid discovery of conflicts and effective conflict resolution is essential.
international regimes for sustainable development major international problems—such as cross-state rivers and lake pollution, transmission of air pollutants across long distances, and pressures to use outer space and the north and south poles for imperial and commercial purposes—have challenged scholars and public officials to create international regimes for sustainable uses of these diverse commons.55 some large-scale resources have been protected successfully through appropriate international governance regimes such as the montreal protocol on stratospheric ozone, which was signed in 1987—the same year the brundtland report was released.
scholars have learned that ecosystems are diverse, complex, and uncertain, and sustainable management requires substantial investment in acquiring accurate data to learn more about patterns of interaction and adapt policies over time that are better fitted to particular systems.
about 4.6 billion people depend for all or some of their water on supplies from forest systems.
due to developments in the technology of fishing, large, high-powered boats can zoom into a local fishery, massively harvest it for a valuable species in the international market, and then move to another location before local authorities respond.
another recommendation related to both reducing deforestation and decreasing global warming is payment for environmental services (pes) for protecting biodiversity and forests.52 pes programs charge residents of the developed world for protecting ecologically diverse sites in the developing world.
james wilson of the university of maine and colleagues have developed a detailed set of simulations showing that if fishers had not taken substantial responsibility for monitoring each other’s harvesting behavior, the successful fishery would have been overharvested—and potentially may have collapsed like many others around the world.28
monitors, who actively audit biophysical conditions and user behavior, are at least partially accountable to users and/or are users themselves.
governance systems that ignore the possibility of conflict over diverse issues may increase the likelihood of these conflicts, which could eventually erupt into major problems.
proponents stress that pes policies are strongly related to sustainable development since payments could be allocated to poorer residents of tropical forests who have a financial, as well as a lifestyle, motivation to protect forests.
the pictures they provide are, of course, mixed, with their own share of environmental horrors, economic greed, and program failures.
thus, policies to reduce deforestation by communities and small-scale owners may not directly affect the extent of damage in this and many other regions affected by large-scale clearing of private land driven largely by commodity markets.
34 new zealand authorities found that the biological models underlying the initial allocation of permanent allocation of fixed quotas needed to be adjusted over time in light of further evidence.
users and their officials have rapid access to low-cost, local arenas to resolve conflict among users or between users and officials.
the ecological services of these developing countries serve the entire world, while the costs of preservation are borne by residents of the developed world.
these problems, unless addressed, will substantially diminish the benefits that future generations obtain from ecosystems.8 thus, the most recent worldwide review of our common future warned that major changes threatened our future.
continued overharvesting of forest resources forest resources were not a focus of chapter 10 of the wced’s report, but they have become major news of recent times, especially given the impact of deforestation on global climate change.
building respectful collaborations between local users, public officials, and scientific experts is a vital requisite of adaptive governance.
further, each person’s use of such resources subtracts benefits that others might enjoy.10 fisheries and forests are two common-pool resources that are of great concern in this era of major ecological challenges.
this generates a measure of forest condition that is comparable across different ecological regions.
designing a system in a top-down fashion and imposing it on the harvesters is not as successful as working with the users of a common-pool resource over time to develop a system that is well-matched to the ecological system as well as to the practices, norms, and long-term economic welfare of the participants, as was accomplished in new zealand.
thus, the forester or ecologist who supervises the collection of forest data at a set of international forestry resources and institutions sites is asked after completing these measurements to rate the forest on a five-point scale from very sparse to very abundant.
since the ecological, technological, economic, and social factors affecting the performance of any commons regime change over time, information about the conditions of the resource and its users also needs to be updated regularly.
the dfo reopened the fishery several years later with new regulations, including an annual itq system.33 further, they established a rigorous monitoring program in which onboard observers record all catches.
while the news related to ocean fisheries and many coastal fisheries is bleak, it is not entirely grim for fishery stocks on all coasts.
without an active dialogue, the world would simply continue on the path toward an unsustainable future instead of searching for ways to avert the disaster that may ensue if we do not confront the massive overharvesting of fisheries and forests around the world, as well as the challenge of substantially reducing carbon emissions.

the mea noted that the global area containing forested land has been cut in half over the past three centuries: forests have effectively disappeared in 25 countries, and another 29 have lost more than 90% of their forest cover.
in his classic article, “the tragedy of the commons,” leading ecologist garrett hardin confused open-access commons with commons that are the joint property of a community.14 while hardin correctly pointed out that valuable open-access common-pool resources would be overharvested, his conclusion of an inevitable tragedy was too sweeping.
a closer look reveals that this prediction is true for developed countries, where the volume of catch has steadily declined since 1979.
thus, the authority to act and the willingness to make decisions that involve short-term costs for the fishing industry (even when it is in their long-term interest) are not equivalent.
the system is still evolving and faces problems related to mismatches among the temporary and spatial dimensions of the property rights assigned to diverse groups.36 in 1990, iceland also introduced an itq system after multiple crises in icelandic fishery
the real tragedy here is that the local fishers, who had established local rules for managing the fishery before the government’s intervention and were the backbone of local economies, paid the cost of the collapse rather than the officials who had not listened to them.
instead, many governments subsidized an expansion of their own national fleets, leading to increased rather than decreased fishing in coastal regions.
tragically, national officials did not recognize local rules when they passed the wildlife resources conservation and protection act in 2001, which prohibted hunting of threatened wildlife and banned the collection of marine turtle eggs.

thus, the authority to act and the willingness to make decisions that involve short-term costs for the fishing industry (even when it is in their long-term interest) are not equivalent.
as a result, in 1990, the commercial fishers received a revised itq based on a proportion of the total catch assigned annually.35 over time, the original itq system has evolved into a comanagement system in which the fishers participate in gathering data and making policies.
scholars have learned that ecosystems are diverse, complex, and uncertain, and sustainable management requires substantial investment in acquiring accurate data to learn more about patterns of interaction and adapt policies over time that are better fitted to particular systems.
while the harvesting volume has doubled, the population of many species harvested for food has declined or disappeared.18 a basic problem leading to massive overfishing in the oceans is the lack ofany property rights for the many commercially valuable species in the open ocean.
in addition, many voluntary programs have been established on multiple scales and generated diverse results.58 considerable learning can be achieved from comparative study of their performances.
an overemphasis on engineered works such as highways, railways, electricity networks, and modern irrigation systems, however, especially if these works are designed without much awareness of the relevant institutional arrangements of a particular regime, may be counterproductive.
these roving bandits have depleted the sea urchin fisheries in japan, korea, mexico, chile, russia, alaska, the eastern coast of canada, and the northwestern and northeastern coasts of the united states.
with the establishment of eezs, some coastal fisheries in canada, new zealand, and iceland have been able to develop individual transferable quota (itq) systems that have reduced the level of harvesting in key coastal fisheries.
new technologies, including remote sensing and gis, provide more accurate information to localities that can be used for better decisionmaking.
the lobster fishery also has evolved toward a monoculture that leaves it exposed to the threat of diverse ecological problems, including an epidemic among the lobster.
their second major finding was that while these changes have led to substantial net gains in economic development and human well-being, the gains have been achieved at growing costs in the form of the degradation of many ecosystem services, increased risks of nonlinear changes, and the exacerbation of poverty for some groups of people.
the specific designs of long-enduring governance regimes related to common-pool resources vary substantially from one another because of resource system diversity, as well as the social and economic settings of these resources.
however, in some specific niches, such as the maine lobster fishery, the commons are in better condition today than they were a decade or two ago.
further, we need to recognize the thrust of massive damage to forests from uncontrolled insect infestations.
proponents stress that pes policies are strongly related to sustainable development since payments could be allocated to poorer residents of tropical forests who have a financial, as well as a lifestyle, motivation to protect forests.
many of the individuals affected by harvesting and protection rules are included in the group who can modify these rules.
designing multiple tiers of arenas that can engage in rapid discovery of conflicts and effective conflict resolution is essential.

this generates a measure of forest condition that is comparable across different ecological regions.
the cod fishery has not yet recovered: the cod fishers have had to leave local villages, find jobs elsewhere, or go on welfare.
in the state of maine, for example, local fishers and state officials have successfully evolved ways to manage lobster stocks.
thus, specific institutional arrangements that work best in a particular location need to take into account the appropriate spatial and temporal scales as well as the type of interactions that occur on the ground.
for example, some modern irrigation systems are constructed without information on farmers’ property rights and cause considerable disruption.68 the diverse types of infrastructure need to work and change together over time.
a team led by fikret berkes of the university of manitoba’s natural resources institute documents another harvesting process practiced by “roving bandits” that is sequentially devastating coastal fisheries even within eezs: “roving banditry is different from most commons dilemmas in that a new dynamic has arisen in the globalized world: new markets can develop so rapidly that the speed of resource exploitation often overwhelms the ability of local institutions to respond.
in the november 2007 issue ofenvironment, raul p. lejano and helen ingram of the university of california, irvine, document a very successful local system that evolved over a decade in the turtle islands of the philippines.30 while outsiders were deeply involved in the effort to find mechanisms that would control overfishing of turtle eggs, they worked very closely with local fishers and officials to develop a system, the pawikan conservation project, which was well-matched to the local economy.
setting up strict hierarchical systems may increase the speed of decisions but ignore the interests of some participants who eventually erupt and potentially destroy an operational system.
with the establishment of eezs, some coastal fisheries in canada, new zealand, and iceland have been able to develop individual transferable quota (itq) systems that have reduced the level of harvesting in key coastal fisheries.
in addition, many voluntary programs have been established on multiple scales and generated diverse results.58 considerable learning can be achieved from comparative study of their performances.
in canada, for example, the department of fisheries and oceans (dfo) used a model of stock regeneration for northern cod that scientists later determined was flawed.23 further, highly aggregated and incomplete data was used in deciding on quotas.
about 4.6 billion people depend for all or some of their water on supplies from forest systems.
in the state of maine, for example, local fishers and state officials have successfully evolved ways to manage lobster stocks.
a study of the distribution of pes payments in costa rica, for example, found that payments tended to be allocated to large landowners with high incomes.53

part of the reason for the mixed results is that most common-pool resources differ vastly from one another.
inour common future, the commission wrote, “humanity has the ability to make development sustainable—to ensure it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
monitoring by officials or users of a forest makes a consistent difference in the forest conditions found in government and community forests.49
in his analysis of the long and conflict-ridden road to the icelandic itq system, new york university professor of politics thráinn eggertsson38 reflects that introducing major institutional changes is a “subtle art” compared to using a simpler “one-size-fits-all” formula.

in the two decades that followed, humans have failed to halt the tragedy of massive overfishing of the oceans, major deforestation, and excessive dumping of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
their second major finding was that while these changes have led to substantial net gains in economic development and human well-being, the gains have been achieved at growing costs in the form of the degradation of many ecosystem services, increased risks of nonlinear changes, and the exacerbation of poverty for some groups of people.
setting up strict hierarchical systems may increase the speed of decisions but ignore the interests of some participants who eventually erupt and potentially destroy an operational system.
that future is severely threatened, however, if we do not focus on how to protect our common heritage while endeavoring to achieve greater economic returns for the peoples of the world.
eezs assign sovereign powers to coastal states to manage these resources and assure they are not endangered by overexploitation.20 that agreement was heralded by the wced, which stated “not only do governments now have the legal power and the self-interest to apply sound principles of resource management within this area, but they have an obligation to do so.
while many environmental and social problems are worse today than two decades ago, the authors of the wced report should be congratulated for stimulating an essential dialogue among scholars, public officials, nongovernmental organizations, and citizens about strategies for achieving sustainable development.
these rules give effective protection to juvenile lobsters and proven breeding stock as well as limit the number of lobster traps.
these rules give effective protection to juvenile lobsters and proven breeding stock as well as limit the number of lobster traps.
from 1990 to 2000, the global area of temperate forest increased by almost 3 million hectares per year, while deforestation in the tropics occurred at an average rate exceeding 2 million hectares per year over the past two decades.39 as table 2 shows below, total hectares of forested land have steadily declined between 1990 and 2005.
the rights of users to devise their own institutions are not challenged by external governmental authorities, and users have long-term tenure rights to the resource.
as a result, in 1990, the commercial fishers received a revised itq based on a proportion of the total catch assigned annually.35 over time, the original itq system has evolved into a comanagement system in which the fishers participate in gathering data and making policies.
the 2007 fishing quota established by the european union for eastern baltic cod, for example, ignored the warning of the international council for the exploitation of the sea (ices), the scientific body advising the european union on catch sizes, which strongly advised skipping at least one year in authorizing any catch.25 even the reduced catch levels set for western baltic cod remained 30 percent over the level recommended by ices.

in 1979, according to data cited in this chapter, the total volume of fish captured (from wild fisheries and aquaculture—cultivating fish, especially for food) was more than 70 million tons, and overexploitation threatened many fishery stocks.
on the other hand, harvesting from fisheries of developing countries, but not necessarily by local fishers, has continued to grow and is now 80 percent of the vastly increased overall total.
fishery after fishery has been subject to massive overfishing, including the tuna and whale fisheries in the pacific, the cod fishery in the atlantic, and the lobster and conch fisheries in the caribbean.19 in 1982, the united nations conference on the law of the sea did remove around one-third of the oceans from the international realm by establishing exclusive economic zones (eezs) that extend 200 nautical miles along the oceanic borders of coastal states.
rules specifying the amount of resource products that a user is allocated are related to local conditions and rules requiring labor, materials, and/or money inputs.
no question exists that some protected areas are very successful in protecting local forests, such as the tikal national park in guatemala or the machadinho d’oeste reserves in rondônia, brazil.45 on the other hand, deforestation threatens many areas around the world that are designated as protected but are not sufficiently budgeted or staffed to actually protect the forest.46
a second set of territorial rules developed by fishers allocate fishing locations to fishers living near and fishing from a particular harbor.
the real tragedy here is that the local fishers, who had established local rules for managing the fishery before the government’s intervention and were the backbone of local economies, paid the cost of the collapse rather than the officials who had not listened to them.
for example, some modern irrigation systems are constructed without information on farmers’ property rights and cause considerable disruption.68 the diverse types of infrastructure need to work and change together over time.
in contrast, while international groups, state-level public officials, and the fishers tried to regulate the lobster fisheries in the caribbean, none of these groups’ efforts have been able to stem the overharvesting of lobster in this region.29

governments assign itqs, official harvesting quotas, to a fisher that then may use them to harvest his or her assigned quantity or sell them to another fisher (hence the term “transferable”).
without active monitoring, however, the incentive to freeride on the cooperation of others can generate a tragedy of the commons.
even though local fishers in newfoundland feared a collapse was near, the canadian dfo assured everyone that the cod fishery was recuperating from earlier excessive harvests.
the challenge is combining accurate scientific understanding of coupled human-environmental systems and expected changes in these variables over time with information available to the users about their own future and the changes they can make in governance as well as use.
in contrast, common-pool resources are sufficiently large that it is difficult, but not impossible, to define recognized users and exclude other users altogether.

the most pressing commons problem at a global level is the need to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations substantially.
rather, the users of a commons, who are frequently widely dispersed, need to take some responsibility for monitoring.
setting scientifically recommended fishing quotas for large coastal fisheries—even when official authority exists—frequently has been difficult and conflict-laden for public officials.

these roving bandits have depleted the sea urchin fisheries in japan, korea, mexico, chile, russia, alaska, the eastern coast of canada, and the northwestern and northeastern coasts of the united states.
as a result of extensive studies, however, we are learning some key lessons that, if applied, may enable the humans living on earth to improve on their past performance.60 no cure-alls the most important lesson that needs wide dissemination is that simple panaceas offered for solving problems related to the commons—whether they are for government, private, or community ownership—may work in some settings but fail in others.61 as examples have shown, quick fixes may cause more harm than good.62 instead, officials and citizens need to craft institutions at multiple levels built on accurate data gathered at appropriate scales given the type of resource involved.
national governments also tended to use relatively crude models of fishery dynamics in the early years of their responsibilities and had insufficient data to assess stocks.22

it is better to induce cooperation with institutional arrangements fitted to local ecosystems than to try to command it from afar.63 users need to perceive and understand the rules as legitimate, or they will invest heavily in illegal harvesting.

in a study of three amazonian states in brazil (acre, pará, and rondônia), indiana university professor eduardo brondizio and colleagues used official deforestation data from the brazilian-based national institute for space research (instituto nacional de pesquisas espaciais) to study the relative contribution of deforested patches of different sizes to total deforestation in each state.51 they found that clearings associated with smaller-sized holdings dominate the number of clearings, but the percent of land cleared in areas that are equal to or larger than 2,000 hectares exceeded 85 percent of total deforested area in all three states (85.9 in acre, 91.2 in pará, and 94.5 in rondônia).
comparing forest measures such as the average diameter at breast height or basal area across ecological zones is misleading since these measures are strongly affected by precipitation, soils, elevation, and other factors that dramatically vary across zones.
whereas open access to oceans, compounded by roving bandits and ineffective governance in eezs, is a major cause of overfishing, one cannot blame the problem of overharvested timber and deforestation on lack of ownership.
monitors, who actively audit biophysical conditions and user behavior, are at least partially accountable to users and/or are users themselves.
the only major increases in forested areas have occurred in east asia, where china has, taken aggressive steps to reduce deforestation, and in the caribbean, where substantial urban migration has led to reforestation of the highland areas of puerto rico and the dominican republic.40 whereas open access to oceans, compounded by roving bandits and ineffective governance in eezs, is a major cause of overfishing, one cannot blame the problem of overharvested timber and deforestation on lack of ownership.
it is better to induce cooperation with institutional arrangements fitted to local ecosystems than to try to command it from afar.63 users need to perceive and understand the rules as legitimate, or they will invest heavily in illegal harvesting.
designing a system in a top-down fashion and imposing it on the harvesters is not as successful as working with the users of a common-pool resource over time to develop a system that is well-matched to the ecological system as well as to the practices, norms, and long-term economic welfare of the participants, as was accomplished in new zealand.
in a study of three amazonian states in brazil (acre, pará, and rondônia), indiana university professor eduardo brondizio and colleagues used official deforestation data from the brazilian-based national institute for space research (instituto nacional de pesquisas espaciais) to study the relative contribution of deforested patches of different sizes to total deforestation in each state.51 they found that clearings associated with smaller-sized holdings dominate the number of clearings, but the percent of land cleared in areas that are equal to or larger than 2,000 hectares exceeded 85 percent of total deforested area in all three states (85.9 in acre, 91.2 in pará, and 94.5 in rondônia).
we are fallible humans studying fallible human behavior within institutional structures constructed by other fallible humans.
another recommendation related to both reducing deforestation and decreasing global warming is payment for environmental services (pes) for protecting biodiversity and forests.52 pes programs charge residents of the developed world for protecting ecologically diverse sites in the developing world.
the cod fishery has not yet recovered: the cod fishers have had to leave local villages, find jobs elsewhere, or go on welfare.
while many environmental and social problems are worse today than two decades ago, the authors of the wced report should be congratulated for stimulating an essential dialogue among scholars, public officials, nongovernmental organizations, and citizens about strategies for achieving sustainable development.
tragically, national officials did not recognize local rules when they passed the wildlife resources conservation and protection act in 2001, which prohibted hunting of threatened wildlife and banned the collection of marine turtle eggs.
users who violate rules-in-use are likely to receive graduated sanctions (depending on the seriousness and context of the offense) from other users, officials accountable to these users, or both.
the itq system has collected more valid data, decreased fleet overcapacity, recorded catch levels close to allocated quotas, and reduced discard of unwanted species.
users who violate rules-in-use are likely to receive graduated sanctions (depending on the seriousness and context of the offense) from other users, officials accountable to these users, or both.
further, we need to recognize the thrust of massive damage to forests from uncontrolled insect infestations.
the boundaries of the resource system, such as irrigation systems or fisheries, and the individuals or households with rights to harvest resource units are clearly defined.
most of the ocean fisheries are truly open access.
even though local fishers in newfoundland feared a collapse was near, the canadian dfo assured everyone that the cod fishery was recuperating from earlier excessive harvests.
others include irrigation systems, groundwater basins, pastures and grazing systems, lakes, oceans, and the earth’s atmosphere.11 chapter 10 of the brundtland report primarily discusses the problematic condition of common-pool resources in the late 1980s; thus this update will focus on common-pool resources.
an overemphasis on engineered works such as highways, railways, electricity networks, and modern irrigation systems, however, especially if these works are designed without much awareness of the relevant institutional arrangements of a particular regime, may be counterproductive.
further, policies also have to fit with the local culture and institutional environments of those who depend on ecosystems for their livelihood.
the dfo reopened the fishery several years later with new regulations, including an annual itq system.33 further, they established a rigorous monitoring program in which onboard observers record all catches.
stocks.37 similar to the evolved new zealand itq system, quotas do not assign fixed quantities but rather a share of the annual authorized catch level set by the government.
further, each person’s use of such resources subtracts benefits that others might enjoy.10 fisheries and forests are two common-pool resources that are of great concern in this era of major ecological challenges.
on the other hand, harvesting from fisheries of developing countries, but not necessarily by local fishers, has continued to grow and is now 80 percent of the vastly increased overall total.
continued overharvesting of forest resources forest resources were not a focus of chapter 10 of the wced’s report, but they have become major news of recent times, especially given the impact of deforestation on global climate change.
thus, specific institutional arrangements that work best in a particular location need to take into account the appropriate spatial and temporal scales as well as the type of interactions that occur on the ground.
the law was largely based on international conventions that stress the importance of protecting endangered species.
depending on the setting, government ownership, private property, community property, and comanagement may succeed or fail in sustaining resources and providing good economic returns.13 open-access resources—common-pool resources that anyone can enter and/or harvest—are likely to be overharvested and potentially destroyed.
as a result of extensive studies, however, we are learning some key lessons that, if applied, may enable the humans living on earth to improve on their past performance.60 no cure-alls the most important lesson that needs wide dissemination is that simple panaceas offered for solving problems related to the commons—whether they are for government, private, or community ownership—may work in some settings but fail in others.61 as examples have shown, quick fixes may cause more harm than good.62 instead, officials and citizens need to craft institutions at multiple levels built on accurate data gathered at appropriate scales given the type of resource involved.
governments assign itqs, official harvesting quotas, to a fisher that then may use them to harvest his or her assigned quantity or sell them to another fisher (hence the term “transferable”).
thus, the forester or ecologist who supervises the collection of forest data at a set of international forestry resources and institutions sites is asked after completing these measurements to rate the forest on a five-point scale from very sparse to very abundant.
a second study of the costa rica pes experiment based on remote sensing and geographic information systems (gis) found that deforestation was not significantly less in regions where large allocations of pes payments had been invested.54 hopefully, some of the initial experiments will provide some insight on how to achieve these complex goals.
due to developments in the technology of fishing, large, high-powered boats can zoom into a local fishery, massively harvest it for a valuable species in the international market, and then move to another location before local authorities respond.
the boundaries of the resource system, such as irrigation systems or fisheries, and the individuals or households with rights to harvest resource units are clearly defined.
monitoring by officials or users of a forest makes a consistent difference in the forest conditions found in government and community forests.49
in 1979, according to data cited in this chapter, the total volume of fish captured (from wild fisheries and aquaculture—cultivating fish, especially for food) was more than 70 million tons, and overexploitation threatened many fishery stocks.
comparing forest measures such as the average diameter at breast height or basal area across ecological zones is misleading since these measures are strongly affected by precipitation, soils, elevation, and other factors that dramatically vary across zones.
forest systems are associated with the regulation of 57% of total water runoff.
the challenge is combining accurate scientific understanding of coupled human-environmental systems and expected changes in these variables over time with information available to the users about their own future and the changes they can make in governance as well as use.
in the two decades that followed, humans have failed to halt the tragedy of massive overfishing of the oceans, major deforestation, and excessive dumping of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
while many policy analysts think that extending private ownership of a common-pool resource is an assured method for long-term sustainability, private ownership of forests does not guarantee long-term protection.
a second set of territorial rules developed by fishers allocate fishing locations to fishers living near and fishing from a particular harbor.
depending on the setting, government ownership, private property, community property, and comanagement may succeed or fail in sustaining resources and providing good economic returns.13 open-access resources—common-pool resources that anyone can enter and/or harvest—are likely to be overharvested and potentially destroyed.
a study of the distribution of pes payments in costa rica, for example, found that payments tended to be allocated to large landowners with high incomes.53 a second study of the costa rica pes experiment based on remote sensing and geographic information systems (gis) found that deforestation was not significantly less in regions where large allocations of pes payments had been invested.54 hopefully, some of the initial experiments will provide some insight on how to achieve these complex goals.
the iceland itq system appears to have averted the collapse of many valuable species for the iceland fishery but has been less successful in restoring the icelandic cod stocks.
setting scientifically recommended fishing quotas for large coastal fisheries—even when official authority exists—frequently has been difficult and conflict-laden for public officials.
stocks.37 similar to the evolved new zealand itq system, quotas do not assign fixed quantities but rather a share of the annual authorized catch level set by the government.
