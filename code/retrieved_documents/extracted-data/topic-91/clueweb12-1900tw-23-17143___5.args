what they'll need most of all is the kind of knee-bending humility evoked in the final line of the poem earlier i promised not to quote: "...only god can make a tree.
more to the point, the agency's century-long inability to rearrange the san gabriels' biota to its liking is a powerful rejoinder to those who so confidently believe that planting trees, indiscriminately and in large number, will help resolve some of the challenges that a climate-changed world is bringing.

because of their remarkable -- their life-essential task -- of converting carbon dioxide into organic compounds such as sugar and then releasing oxygen (their waste, our gain), trees have the unusual ability to cleanse the air we breathe.
flintham's successor, spencer turner, "was disillusioned with the high tree mortality," according to a county report, and recognized the "value of chaparral as a precious watershed cover that perhaps is fire dependent and best adapted to the site.

after all, when some of the world's most-accomplished land managers have a hard time getting it right, it's difficult to believe that modern-day johnny appleseeds will do better.
their canopy as forests, and as cover along streets, can cool soil and concrete, decreasing temperatures and moderating heat-island effects; by releasing an aerosol mist (forest bathing, the japanese call it) they can make life more bearable for any species inhabiting these particular landscapes.
"then the ground dried out and there just wasn't enough moisture after we planted."
"then the ground dried out and there just wasn't enough moisture after we planted." the forest service has gone back to the drawing board, shrinking the number of acres to be planted and, where possible, switching to tree species that are indigenous to the san gabriel mountains.
to restrain it, the research team sprayed the grass-planted watersheds with herbicides, a strategy that comes with two ironies.
the scientists did not fully accept the evidence their research revealed; instead, they insisted that under ideal conditions -- ample rain, significant labor, and chemical applications -- "land managers appear justified in trying to establish a grass crop."
still, they admitted, "this treatment should not be taken as a cure-all."
only about 25 percent of the seedlings dug into charred slopes, cindered meadows, and blackened canyon floors have survived, a mortality rate that has stunned agency foresters.
" undaunted, as the smoke cleared from a 1960 blaze that roared through upper san dimas canyon, agency researchers decided again that chaparral had to go.
the news of the past year's die-off came as no surprise: "the reality we live in is a mediterranean climate, and there is just not enough water to create what they have in mind.
like a host of foresters and urban planners, robbins is convinced too that trees form a kind of green shield.
" in 1930, three years after turner and his colleagues paid tribute to the late flintham's devoted service byplanting in his memory a 20-acre coulter-pine plantation in the angeles national forest, (it was incinerated in the 2002 williams fire), the new chief issued a restraining order: his foresters henceforth would "plant less, plant better."
"when we planted seedlings, conditions were ideal in terms of soil composition and temperature, rainfall and weather trends,"one of them told the la times.

yes it is true it is not always necessary to plant trees to combat climate change.

by themselves, they cannot compensate for the all toxins that blow out of the tailpipes, smokestacks, or cooling towers in los angeles or houston -- cities with some of the nation's dirtiest air.
when he was hired in 1911 as the county's first trained forester (and later its fire warden),stuart j. flintham instigated an aggressive firefighting operation throughout the foothills; it included lookout towers, an extensive network of firebreaks, and the massing of tools and men to help suppress wildfire.

sure: if we had a more complete picture of the variations of potential temperature change across ecosystems and typographies; if we could pinpoint when and where alterations in precipitation will occur; and were we able to calibrate the shifting influence that heat, light, and wet will have on differing soil types, then we might have a clue about what tree species to plant in which biota and at what times.

so to plant trees in hopes that they will survive -- and thus increase the odds of us doing so -- seems, at best, random.
after four years these and other opportunistic plants had revegetated approximately 50 percent of the burned watersheds, a speed of recovery and density of cover that modern technology could not replicate.

they're "capable of cleaning up the most toxic wastes, including explosives, solvents and organic wastes, largely through a dense community of microbes around the tree's roots that clean water in exchange for nutrients, a process known as phytoremediation." because of their remarkable -- their life-essential task -- of converting carbon dioxide into organic compounds such as sugar and then releasing oxygen (their waste, our gain), trees have the unusual ability to cleanse the air we breathe.
despite what federal foresters long have understood about the low fertility of local soils, mercurial weather patterns, and steep canyon walls, they have repeatedly endeavored to re-engineer the san gabriels' ground cover.
