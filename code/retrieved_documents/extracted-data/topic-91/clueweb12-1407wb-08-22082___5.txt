in summary, a random forest model is a good choice for model building for  a number of reasons.
the generalisation error rate from random forests tends to compare favourably to boosting approaches, yet the approach tends to be more robust to noise in the training dataset, and so tends to be a very stable model builder, not suffering the sensitivity to noise in a dataset that single decision tree induction does.

the random forest model builder is able to target the most useful variables.
the randomness introduced by the random forest model builder in the dataset selection and in the variable selection delivers considerable robustness to noise, outliers, and over-fitting, when compared to a single tree classifier.
the random forest model builder can also report on the input variables that are actually most important in determining the values of the output variable.

a random forest is an ensemble (i.e., a collection) of unpruned  decision trees.
in building the random forest model we have options to choose the number of trees to build, to choose the training dataset sample size to use for building each decision tree, and to choose the number of variables to randomly select when considering how to partition the training dataset at each node.

each decision tree is built from a random subset of the training dataset,  using what is called replacement (thus it is doing what is known as bagging),  in performing this sampling.
also, at each node in the process of building the  decision tree, only a small fraction of all of the available variables are  considered when determining how to best partition the dataset.
in summary, a random forest model is a good choice for model building for a number of reasons.
in building the random forest model we have options to choose the number  of trees to build, to choose the training dataset sample size to use for  building each decision tree, and to choose the number of variables to randomly  select when considering how to partition the training dataset at each node.
thirdly, because many trees are built and there are two  levels of randomness and each tree is effectively an independent model, the  model builder tends not to overfit to the training dataset.
