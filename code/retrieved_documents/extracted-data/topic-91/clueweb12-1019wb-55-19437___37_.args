we applied random forests to determine a good classifier based on a subset of our loci and determined that combined use of the same four top markers allows identification of lung cancer tissue from non-lung cancer tissue with 94% sensitivity and 90% specificity.this would greatly increase the chances of curative resection of lung cancer, while minimizing unnecessary and potentially life-threatening procedures in patients with benign lesions.our analyses of the present sample collection, which contains modest numbers of representatives from all these groups, is very encouraging as they suggest that the markers function independently of subject age, gender or ethnic subgroup, and are positive in early stage cancer.to determine which combinations of markers would be most effective to correctly identify tumor vs. non-tumor samples, we fit a random forest classifier to the data set, using 87 samples and 28 variables (2 ad samples with missing pmr data were omitted, resulting in 49 ad vs. 38 adjntl).this suggests that basal dna methylation is high but variable at this locus; elevated dna methylation in tumors is likely masked by interpatient variability and only becomes visible when samples from the same patient are compared.dna hypermethylation at promoter cpg islands shows great promise as a cancer-specific marker that would complement visual lung cancer screening tools such as spiral ct, improving early detection.to make an impact on long term survival, better strategies are needed for early detection.given the histopathologic, clinical and molecular differences between lung cancer subtypes, we believe that markers should be developed individually for the major histological subtypes.of the many potential molecular markers, dna hypermethylation – an epigenetic alteration – shows great promise.if molecular markers with high sensitivity and specificity for cancers that will progress can be identified, such markers could be combined with spiral ct to screen high-risk individuals, allowing molecular detection and visualization of clinically relevant early lesions.to date the penetrance of dna methylation at any single locus has been too low to provide great clinical sensitivity.to determine which combinations of markers would be most effective to correctly identify tumor vs. non-tumor samples, we fit a random forest classifier to the data set, using the r programming language (v 2.5[39]) and 87 samples and 28 variables (2 ad samples with missing pmr data were omitted, resulting in 49 ad/38 adjntl).environmental exposures, such as those arising from tobacco smoke, could lead to higher basal levels of methylation in non-tumor lung[12], which might affect the background signal when any resulting markers are applied to non-invasive molecular analyses of bodily fluids in the future.ideal dna hypermethylation markers for lung adenocarcinoma should show a high frequency of methylation in tumors as well as dna methylation levels that are significantly elevated in tumor compared to non-tumor lung tissue.quantitative assessment of dna methylation levels allows a more detailed evaluation of candidate dna methylation markers, and of their suitability for correctly identifying a cancer vs. non-cancer sample.
