a multi-level object-oriented and decision-tree classifier for detailed habitat mapping in rugged terrain.rule-based classifications incorporating spectral and ancillary data.alternative splitting rules for classification tree analysis had only minor effects on overall accuracy results of classified imagery, although, individual class accuracies varied widely.0803 an svm based multi-source classification shows a significant increase in the classification accuracy with incorporation of ancillary data over the classification performed solely on the basis of spectral data from remote sensing sensors.0702 mathematical morphology; dynamics; graph; watershed; minimum spanning tree; component tree necessary and sufficient conditions which indicate when a transformation preserves the dynamics of the regional maxima.0404 model trees extend regression trees by having multiple regression models.bibref garcia-gutierrez, j.[jorge], gon√ßalves-seco, l.[luis], riquelme-santos, j.c.[jose c.], decision trees on lidar to classify land uses and covers, laser09(323).0701 class distribution; decision tree; sampling; comprehensibility; c4.5bibref gurrutxaga, i.[ibai], albisua, i.[inaki], arbelaitz, o.[olatz], martin, j.i.[jose i.], muguerza, j.[javier], perez, j.m.[jesus m.], perona, i.[inigo], sep/cop: an efficient method to find the best partition in hierarchical clustering based on a new cluster validity index, pr(43), no. 10, october 2010, pp.bibref li, w.l.[wen-long], liang, t.g.[tian-gang], wang, x.[xun] , remote sensing image extraction and precision analysis for alpine wetland based on coupling analysis of multispectral factor pca and decision tree , cisp09(1-6).bibref 8300 chapter on pattern recognition, clustering, statistics, grammars, learning, neural nets, genetic algorithms continues in context and structure for classification.springer doi link 0608 create a decision tree classifier, where each node is based on viola-jones ( see alsorobust real-time face detection. ).bibref isukapalli, r.[ramana], elgammal, a.m.[ahmed m.], greiner, r.[russell], learning to detect objects of many classes using binary classifiers, eccv06(i: 352-364).0404 optimize misclassification rate.m1 work for weak base classifiers by changing only one line of the code. )
