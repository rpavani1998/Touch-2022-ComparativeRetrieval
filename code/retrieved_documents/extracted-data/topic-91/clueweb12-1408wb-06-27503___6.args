a series of models are built and the weights are increased (boosted) if a model incorrectly classifies the observation.

those entites in the training data which the model was unable to capture (i.e., the model mis-classifies those entites) have their weights boosted.

boosting builds a collection of models using a ``weak learner'' and thereby reduces misclassification error, bias, and variance (, ,).
the result is then a panel of models used to make a decision on new data by combining the ``expertise'' of each model in such a way that the more accurate experts carry more weight.
a weak learning algorithm is one that is only somewhat better than random guessing in terms of error rates (i.e., the error rate is just below 50%).

boosting algorithms build multiple models from a dataset, using some other model builders, such as a decision tree builder, that need not be a particularly good model builder.
