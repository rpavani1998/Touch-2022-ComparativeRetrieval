by placing all the things in a priority queue and pulling them off in order, we can improve performance over linear search or sorting, particularly if the weights change.this suggests a dynamic programming-like strategy, where we store the distance froms to all nearby nodes, and use them to find the shortest path to more distant nodes.thus we need a data structure for maintaining sets which can test if two elements are in the same and merge two sets together.dynamic programming works best on objects which are linearly ordered and cannot be rearranged - characters in a string, matrices in a chain, points around the boundary of a polygon, the left-to-right order of leaves in a search tree.backtracking ensures correctness by enumerating all possibilities.this gives us a recursive sorting algorithm, since we can use the partitioning approach to sort each subproblem.picking the first or last candidate gives us a probability of 1/n of getting the best.there are two aspects to any data structure: the fact that we can describe the behavior of our data structures in terms of abstract operations explains why we can use them without thinking, while the fact that we have different implementation of the same abstract operations enables us to optimize performance.knowing the dominance relation between common functions is important because we want algorithms whose time complexity is as low as possible in the hierarchy.an implementation of dijkstra's algorithm would be faster for sparse graphs, and comes from using a heap of the vertices (ordered by distance), and updating the distance to each vertex (if necessary) in time for each edge out from freshly known vertices.rules for algorithm design the secret to successful algorithm design, and problem solving in general, is to make sure you ask the right questions.deletion in an open addressing scheme is ugly, since removing one element can break a chain of insertions, making some elements inaccessible.this very slow growth means it pays to commit one crime stealing a lot of money, rather than many small crimes adding up to the same amount of money, because the time to serve if you get caught is much less.red-black trees are binary search trees where each node is assigned a color, where the coloring scheme helps us maintain the height as .as we will see, induction provides a useful tool to solve recurrences - guess a solution and prove it by induction.
