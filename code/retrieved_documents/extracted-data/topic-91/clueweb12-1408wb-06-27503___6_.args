a weak learning algorithm is one that is only somewhat better than random guessing in terms of error rates (i.e., the error rate is just below 50%).boosting builds a collection of models using a ``weak learner'' and thereby reduces misclassification error, bias, and variance (, ,).boosting algorithms build multiple models from a dataset, using some other model builders, such as a decision tree builder, that need not be a particularly good model builder.we note that boosting can fail to perform if there is insufficient data or if the weak models are overly complex.the result is then a panel of models used to make a decision on new data by combining the ``expertise'' of each model in such a way that the more accurate experts carry more weight.a series of models are built and the weights are increased (boosted) if a model incorrectly classifies the observation.the key is the use of a weak learning algorithm--essentially any weak learner can be used.as a meta learner boosting employs some other simple learning algorithm to build the models.boosting is also susceptible to noise.this model building followed by boosting is repeated until the specific generated model performs no better than random.the algorithm is quite simple, beginning by building an initial model from the training dataset.an example might be decision trees of depth 1 (i.e., decision stumps).a new model is then built with these boosted entities, which we might think of as the problematic entities in the training dataset.the roc curve other examples 10 fold cross validation area under curve calibration curves reporting generating open document format getting started with odfweave openoffice.org macro support generating html generating pdf with latex configuration figure sizes fraud analysis archetype analysis boosting the boosting meta-algorithm is an efficient, simple, and easy to understand model building strategy.formatted output automatically generate filenames reading a large file manipulating data manipulating data as sql using sqlite odbc data database connection excel access clipboard data spatial data simple map
