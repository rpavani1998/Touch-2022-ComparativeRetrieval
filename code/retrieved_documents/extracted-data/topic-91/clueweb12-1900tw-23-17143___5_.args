that they can sequester carbon has been much touted in policymaking circles as one tool to help shrink our carbon footprint; and thus trees seem critical to the larger effort to reduce global warming.because of their remarkable -- their life-essential task -- of converting carbon dioxide into organic compounds such as sugar and then releasing oxygen (their waste, our gain), trees have the unusual ability to cleanse the air we breathe.central to his claim for why trees matter is the positive role they can play in sustaining public health.so to plant trees in hopes that they will survive -- and thus increase the odds of us doing so -- seems, at best, random.sure: if we had a more complete picture of the variations of potential temperature change across ecosystems and typographies; if we could pinpoint when and where alterations in precipitation will occur; and were we able to calibrate the shifting influence that heat, light, and wet will have on differing soil types, then we might have a clue about what tree species to plant in which biota and at what times.yet at a more micro-level, such as a blockface, their presence has been linked to the reduction of asthma.they're "capable of cleaning up the most toxic wastes, including explosives, solvents and organic wastes, largely through a dense community of microbes around the tree's roots that clean water in exchange for nutrients, a process known as phytoremediation." because of their remarkable -- their life-essential task -- of converting carbon dioxide into organic compounds such as sugar and then releasing oxygen (their waste, our gain), trees have the unusual ability to cleanse the air we breathe.like a host of foresters and urban planners, robbins is convinced too that trees form a kind of green shield.their canopy as forests, and as cover along streets, can cool soil and concrete, decreasing temperatures and moderating heat-island effects; by releasing an aerosol mist (forest bathing, the japanese call it) they can make life more bearable for any species inhabiting these particular landscapes.after four years these and other opportunistic plants had revegetated approximately 50 percent of the burned watersheds, a speed of recovery and density of cover that modern technology could not replicate.more to the point, the agency's century-long inability to rearrange the san gabriels' biota to its liking is a powerful rejoinder to those who so confidently believe that planting trees, indiscriminately and in large number, will help resolve some of the challenges that a climate-changed world is bringing.despite what federal foresters long have understood about the low fertility of local soils, mercurial weather patterns, and steep canyon walls, they have repeatedly endeavored to re-engineer the san gabriels' ground cover.as part of a revegetation project, scientists at the san dimas experimental forest randomly selected eight watersheds to seed with annual grasses and eight with perennial grasses; four were left untouched as a control group.donate online so more of your contribution can go towards programming.more on climate, trees, and firefighting book review: bill mckibben's doomsday book 'eaarth' opinion: the problem with planting trees in los angeles history: remembering the la county fire department's 100 years of service he observes not surprisingly that trees are quite efficient water filters.
