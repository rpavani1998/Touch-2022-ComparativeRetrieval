there are three components to building a model: how do we represent the  knowledge (thelanguage for building models); how do we search through all the  possible ways of building the model (sentences in the language); and how do we  know when we have a good model (measurement).
indeed, writing a computer program is essentially about building a model.

as we learn more about the new complex idea we change our model to better reflect the idea, until eventually we have a model that matches the idea enough for us to make good effect of our understanding of the idea.

rattle supports a number of model builders, including decision tree induction, boosted decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, logistic regression, kmeans, and association rules.
in  essence, the model builders differ in how they represent the models they build  (i.e., the discovered knowledge) and how they find (or search for) the best  model within this representation.
