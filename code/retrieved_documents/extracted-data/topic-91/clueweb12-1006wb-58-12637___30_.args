from a cost-sensitive classifier point of view, the experiments show that these types of classifiers are capable of producing some good true positive rates with a controllable false positive rate for highly imbalanced data.as a random forest classifier is an ensemble classifier (an ensemble of random trees), it requires more computational memory than the other classifiers.one of the advantages of using cost-sensitive classifiers is that the number of false positives may be controlled - increasing the misclassification cost of the false negatives will potentially increase both the number of false positives and the number of true positives.as mentioned previously, one of the advantages of using cost-sensitive classifiers is that the false positive rate may be controlled.most classifiers assume equal weighting of the classes in terms of both the number of instances and the level of importance - misclassifying class a has the same importance as misclassifying class b. however, when trying to predict a minority class in an imbalanced dataset or when a false negative is deemed more important than a false positive, standard data mining techniques are not successful.the results have been disappointing and the best true positive rate that can be achieved with under a 20% false positive rate is approximately 55% - this is worse than for the large, highly imbalanced data.weka is a tool that is used by the academic community for both primary and comparative studies and it is important to explain how the cost-sensitive classifiers handle misclassification costs.this is achieved by choosing several compounds that have known activity for a specific biological target and building predictive models that can discriminate between the active and inactive compounds.this means that standard techniques, which assume equality, are not very effective at building predictive models when there is a low minority class ratio.cost-sensitive classifiers most classifiers assume equal weighting of the classes in terms of both the number of instances and the level of importance - misclassifying class a has the same importance as misclassifying class b.though classifier accuracy and precision are not the best statistical evaluation methods for imbalanced datasets, the results of these may be found in the supplementary excel results file.this research has shown that the bioassay data at pubchem is not recorded in a standard and consistent way and some entries contain erroneous information.these experiments are more of a survey of the classifiers rather than an experiment to gain insightful information about potential drugs for the particular targets.structuring the data this way also hinders the investigation in to why so many compounds end up as being false positives in the primary screening process.however, when trying to predict a minority class in an imbalanced dataset or when a false negative is deemed more important than a false positive, standard data mining techniques are not successful.
