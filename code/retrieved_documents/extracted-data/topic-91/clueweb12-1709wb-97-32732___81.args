in the illustration shown above the area outside the upper specification limit (greater than usl) is defined as one million opportunities to produce defects.
however, in practice, we usually ignore the lower tail of the normal curve because (1) in many cases, the process "naturally" has one-sided specification limits (e.g., very low delay times are not really a defect, only very long times; very few customer complaints are not a problem, only very many, etc.), and (2) when a 6 * sigma process has been achieved, the area under the normal curve below the lower specification limit is negligible.
this important transformation will bring all values (regardless of their distributions and original units of measurement) to compatible units from a distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

each computes predicted classifications for a crossvalidation sample, from which overall goodness-of-fit statistics (e.g., misclassification rates) can be computed.
in other words, assuming that in the population there was no relation between those variables whatsoever, and we were repeating experiments like ours one after another, we could expect that approximately in every 20 replications of the experiment there would be one in which the relation between the variables in question would be equal or stronger than in ours.

for example, in two dimensions (i.e., when there are two parameters to be estimated), the program will evaluate the function at three points around the current optimum.
if the ratio is one or lower, making the variable "unavailable" either has no effect on the performance of the network, or actually enhances it.
if applied to the input data, standardization also makes the results of a variety of statistical techniques entirely independent of the ranges of values or the units of measurements (see the discussion of these issues inelementary concepts, basic statistics, multiple regression, factor analysis, and others).

in simple terms, what this means is that the hessian is not used to help find the direction for the next step.
the space plots specific layout may facilitate exploratory examination of specific types of three-dimensional data.

for example, you are trying to predict the times of runners in a 40 meter dash.
worse, if only part of the interdependent set is included, their sensitivity will be zero, as they carry no discernable information.
to the right of this point, presumably, we find only "factorial scree" – "scree" is the geological term referring to the debris that collects on the lower part of a rocky slope.
instead of discarding such observations from the data analysis all together (i.e., unnecessarily loose potentially useful information) survival analysis techniques can accommodate censored observations, and "use" them in statistical significance testing and model fitting.
a surface is fitted to the xyz coordinate data using the bicubic spline smoothing procedure.
these methods are called supervised learning algorithms because the learning (fitting of models) is "guided" or "supervised" by the observed classifications recorded in the data file.
statistica multistream is a complete enterprise system built on a robust, advanced client-server (and fully web-enabled) architecture, offers central administration and management of deployment of models, as well as cutting edge root-cause analysis and predictive data mining technology, and its analytics are seamlessly integrated with a built-in document management system.
by default the window is zero, which means that the minimum improvement stopping condition is not used at all.
to reiterate, we may want to estimatesigma from a set of samples that are known to be in control (the computation set), and use that estimate for establishing control limits for all remaining and new samples (the application set).
suppose your data mining project includes tree classifiers, such as c&rt and  chaid, linear discriminant analysis (e.g., see gda), and neural networks.
the term six sigma derives from the goal to achieve a process variation, so that ± 6 * sigma (the estimate of the population standard deviation) will "fit" inside the lower and upper specification limits for the process.
individual data points are represented by point markers in two-dimensional space, where axes represent the variables.
if applied to the input data, standardization also makes the results of a variety of statistical techniques entirely independent of the ranges of values or the units of measurements (see the discussion of these issues inelementary concepts, basic statistics, multiple regression, factor analysis, and others).
a nonlinear estimation algorithm that does not rely on the computation or estimation of the derivatives of theloss function.
for more examples of how scatterplot data helps identify the patterns of relations between variables, seeoutliers and brushing.
a lower s.d. ratio indicates a better prediction.
in the stub-and-banner table, one list will be tabulated in the columns (horizontally) and the second list will be tabulated in the rows (vertically) of the scrollsheet.
also, we may want to compute the control limits and center line values from aset of samples that are known to be in control, and apply those values to all subsequent samples.

statsoft's statistica base offers a comprehensive set of essential statistics in a user-friendly package with flexible output management and web enablement features; it also includes all statistica graphics tools and a comprehensive visual basic development environment.
the window factor is the number of epochs across which the error must fail to improve by the specified amount, before the algorithm is deemed to have slowed down too much and is stopped.
only after identifying certain clusters can you begin to assign labels, for example, based on subsequent research (e.g., after identifying one group of customers as "young risk takers").
for example, in catalog retailing the response rate to particular catalog offers can be below 1%, and when analyzing historical data (from prior campaigns) to build a model for targeting potential customers more successfully, it is desirable to over-sample past respondents (i.e., the "rare" respondents who ordered from the catalog); we can then apply the various model building techniques for classification (seedata mining) to a sample consisting of approximately 50% responders and 50% non-responders.
finally,survival analysis includes the use of regression models for estimating the relationship of (multiple) continuous variables to survival times.
data sets with censored observations can be analyzed via survival analysis orweibull and reliability/failure time analysis.
this sequential plot fits a spline-smoothed surface to each data point.
to reiterate, we may want to estimatesigma from a set of samples that are known to be in control (the computation set), and use that estimate for establishing control limits for all remaining and new samples (the application set).
statistica multistream was designed for process industries in general.
radial units are used in the second layer of kohonen, radial basis function, clustering, and probabilistic and generalized regression networks.
in summary, sensitivity analysis does not rate the "usefulness" of variables in modeling in a reliable or absolute manner.
cases in the two groups would be assigned values of 1 or -1, respectively, on the coded predictor variable, so that if the regression coefficient for the variable is positive, the group coded as 1 on the predictor variable will have a higher predicted value (i.e., a higher group mean) on the dependent variable, and if the regression coefficient is negative, the group coded as -1 on the predictor variable will have a higher predicted value on the dependent variable.
based on more than 20 years of experience in applying advanced data driven, predictive data mining/optimization technologies for process optimization in various industries, statistica powersolutions enables power plants to get the most out of their existing equipment and control systems by leveraging all data collected at their sites to identify opportunities for improvement, even for older designs such as coal-fired cyclone furnaces (as well as wall-fired or t-fired designs).
for example in theneural network time series analysis, the number of consecutive time steps from which input variable values should be drawn to be fed into the neural network input units.
we then run the network again using the same cases, but this time replacing the observed values ofv with the value estimated by the missing value procedure, and again accumulate the network error.
in addition to standardized residuals several methods (including studentized residuals,studentized deleted residuals, dffits, andstandardized dffits) are available for detecting outlying values (observations with extreme values on the set of predictor variables or the dependent variable).
in summary, sensitivity analysis does not rate the "usefulness" of variables in modeling in a reliable or absolute manner.
sequential/stacked plots, 2d - area.
in this sequential plot, a spline-smoothed surface is fit to each data point.
it may therefore rate the variables as of low sensitivity, even though they might encode key information.
so, for example, the predicted classifications from the tree classifiers, linear model, and the neural network classifier(s) can be used as input variables into a neural network meta-classifier, which will attempt to "learn" from the data how to combine the predictions from the different models to yield maximum classification accuracy.
one component graph is produced for each level of the grouping variable (or user-defined subset of data) and all the component graphs are arranged in one display to allow for comparisons between the subsets of data (categories).
if a trend emerges in those lines, or if samples fall outside pre-specified limits, then the process is declared to be out of control and the operator will take action to find the cause of the problem.
if the variables are not related, then the points form an irregular "cloud" (see the categorized scatterplot below for examples of both types of data sets).
in that case, even if the process mean shifts by 1.5 * sigma in one direction (e.g., to +1.5 sigma in the direction of the upper specification limit), then the process will still produce very few defects.
in time series analysis, the general purpose of smoothing techniques is to "bring out" the major patterns or trends in a time series, while de-emphasizing minor fluctuations (random noise).
for example, if we were to take a simple random sample with a sampling fraction of 1/10,000 from a population of 1,000,000 cases, each case would have a 1/10,000 probability of being selected into the sample, which will consist of approximately 1/10,000 * 1,000,000 = 100 observations.
the control limits computed for those transformed values can then be applied to determine if the production process is in control, to monitor continuing production, and to establish procedures for continuous quality improvement.
however, we can also define stopping conditions that may cause training to determine earlier.
the concept of the six sigma process is important insix sigma quality improvement programs.
altering original variable values (according to a specific function or an algorithm) into a range that meet particular criteria (e.g., positive numbers, fractions, numbers less than 10e12, numbers with a large relative variance).
for example, there is a correlation between the total amount of losses in a fire and the number of firemen that were putting out the fire; however, what this correlation does not indicate is that if we call fewer firemen, we would lower the losses.

areboosting and bagging (voting ).
sets of samples in quality control charts.
consider, for example, the case where two input variables encode the same information (they might even be copies of the same variable).
in stacking, the predictions from different classifiers are used as input into ameta-learner, which attempts to combine the predictions to create a final best predicted classification.
sequential/stacked plots, 2d - lines.
each computes predicted classifications for a crossvalidation sample, from which overall goodness-of-fit statistics (e.g., misclassification rates) can be computed.
however, in biomedical research multiple censoring often exists, for example, when patients are discharged from a hospital after different amounts (times) of treatment, and the researcher knows that the patient survived up to those (differential) points of censoring.
the program represents a stand-alone module that can be used for both model building and deployment.
the spectral plot makes it easier to see that the relationship betweenpressure and yield changes from an "inverted u" to a "u".
however, in practice, we usually ignore the lower tail of the normal curve because (1) in many cases, the process "naturally" has one-sided specification limits (e.g., very low delay times are not really a defect, only very long times; very few customer complaints are not a problem, only very many, etc.), and (2) when a 6 * sigma process has been achieved, the area under the normal curve below the lower specification limit is negligible.
also, we may want to compute the control limits and center line values from aset of samples that are known to be in control, and apply those values to all subsequent samples.
sensitivity analysis can give important insights into the usefulness of individual variables.
the more sensitive the network is to a particular input, the greater the deterioration we can expect, and therefore the greater the ratio.
in a regression problem, the ratio of the prediction error standard deviation to the original output data standard deviation.
if the ratio is one or lower, making the variable "unavailable" either has no effect on the performance of the network, or actually enhances it.
of course, in many cases any "outcomes" (e.g., parts) that are produced that fall below the specification limit can be equally defective.
altering original variable values (according to a specific function or an algorithm) into a range that meet particular criteria (e.g., positive numbers, fractions, numbers less than 10e12, numbers with a large relative variance).
if a trend emerges in those lines, or if samples fall outside pre-specified limits, then the process is declared to be out of control and the operator will take action to find the cause of the problem.
thus, every 3d histogram can be turned into a smoothed surface providing a sensitive method for revealing non-salient overall patterns of data and/or identifying patterns to use in developing quantitative models of the investigated phenomenon.

they attempt to perform classification by dividing pattern space into sections using intersecting hyperplanes.
the basic measure of sensitivity is the ratio of the error with missing value substitution to the original error.
an example of a non-scalable architecture is the dos directory structure (adding files will eventually require splitting them into subdirectories).
thus, the semi-partial or part correlation is a better indicator of the "practical relevance" of a predictor, because it is scaled to (i.e., relative to) the total variability in the dependent (response) variable.
in combination with thecross entropy error function, allows multilayer perceptron networks to be modified for class probability estimation (bishop, 1995; bridle, 1990).

presenting training cases in a random order on eachepoch to prevent various undesirable effects that can otherwise occur (such as oscillation and convergence to local minima).
an example of a non-scalable architecture is the dos directory structure (adding files will eventually require splitting them into subdirectories).
a defining characteristic of survival time data is that they usually include so-calledcensored observations, e.g., observations that "survived" to a certain point in time, and then dropped out from the study (e.g., patients who are discharged from a hospital).
the higher thep- value, the less we can believe that the observed relation between variables in the sample is a reliable indicator of the relation between the respective variables in the population.
the multiple scatterplot is used to compare images of several correlations by overlaying them in a single graph that uses one common set of scales (e.g., to reveal the underlying structure of factors or dimensions in discriminant function analysis).
the assignment of application samples to sets proceeds in a hierarchical manner, i.e., each sample is assigned to the first set where it "fits" (where the definition of the application sample set would include the respective sample).
one component graph is produced for each level of the grouping variable (or user-defined subset of data) and all the component graphs are arranged in one display to allow for comparisons between the subsets of data (categories).
the squared distance is multiplied by the threshold (which is, therefore, actually a deviation value in radial units) to produce the post synaptic value of the unit (which is then passed to the unit's activation function).
worse, if only part of the interdependent set is included, their sensitivity will be zero, as they carry no discernable information.
in this case, the program may iterate into a region of the parameter space from which recovery (i.e., successful iteration to the true minimum point) is not possible.
