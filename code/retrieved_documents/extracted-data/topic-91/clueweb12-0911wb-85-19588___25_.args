recent research has shown that many real-world problems require integration of several dm algorithms from different paradigms in order to produce a better solution elevating the importance of practice-oriented aspects also in dm research.breiman in his introductory paper on random forests claims that they are more robust than boosting with respect to overfitting noise, and are able to compete with boosting in terms of predictive performance.in this paper, we demonstrate that the prediction performance of random forests may still be improved in some domains by replacing the combination function.we review the related work on learning from noisy data and propose to use feature extraction as a pre-processing step to diminish the effect of class noise on the learning process.however, it is clear that each decision tree in a random forest may have different contribution in classifying a certain instance.it clearly results in higher classification accuracy of learnt models without the separate explicit elimination of noisy instances.thus, it should have important implications for the methodology of modern research in cognitive psychology.the game we work with is the classic space invaders game and we show that case-based plan recognition can produce good prediction accuracy in real-time, working with a fairly simple game representation.however, when dynamic integration takes place in high dimensions the search for the neighborhood of a new instance is problematic, since the majority of space is empty and neighbors can in fact be located far from each other.unfortunately the advances in hardware (e.g. device size), have not been matched by software to help manage, organise and analyse this data deluge.since context-specific behaviour tends to crosscut base programs, it can advantageously be implemented as aspects.it is based on the technique of dynamic integration, in which local accuracy estimates are calculated for each base classifier of an ensemble, in the neighborhood of a new instance to be processed.as a research topic computer game playing has contributed problems to ai that manifest exponential growth in the problem space.our experiments with 8 medical datasets show that feature extraction indeed helps to deal with class noise.in this paper we analyze the effect of class noise on supervised learning in medical domains.
