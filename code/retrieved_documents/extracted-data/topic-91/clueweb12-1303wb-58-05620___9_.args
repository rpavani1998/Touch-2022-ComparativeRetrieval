the random forest (rf) method from machine learning (ml) was adapted to predict cause of death by training random forests to distinguish between each pair of causes, and then combining the results through a novel ranking technique.this population-level metric of analysis quality gave results qualitatively similar to the individual-level metric on a cause-specific basis.it should be noted that, while in the literature it is suggested that increasing the number of trees increases the classification precision, as our overall rf method includes an ensemble of one-versus-one classifiers (e.g., for adult vas, rf has one-versus-one classifiers, each including 100 trees), the overall number of trees is high, which results in stable performance.for example, nonuniformly increasing the number of trees in the forest to have proportionately more for select causes (in the spirit of boosting[17]) is a potential direction for future exploration.the decision trees in breiman's random forest method are generated by a randomized algorithm from bootstrap-resampled training data, but the resulting trees are somewhat analogous to the expert algorithms used in early approaches to automatic va analysis.methods the random forest (rf) method from machine learning (ml) was adapted to predict cause of death by training random forests to distinguish between each pair of causes, and then combining the results through a novel ranking technique.unlike expert algorithms, however, the decision trees in breiman's random forest are generated automatically from labeled examples (the training dataset), without guidance from human experts.we assessed quality of the new method at the individual level using chance-corrected concordance and at the population level using cause-specific mortality fraction (csmf) accuracy as well as linear regression.for example, for adult deaths due to tuberculosis, aids, diabetes, and asthma, chance-corrected concordance increased by more than 20 percentage points when hce variables were included.this shows that rf attains higher cause-specific chance-corrected concordances as a result of better classification, not simply by assigning a higher portion of deaths to some causes.this is an important advantage over pcva, which can produce results of widely varying quality among different physicians, according to their training and experience[14].keywords: verbal autopsy; cause of death certification; validation; machine learning; random forests introduction verbal autopsy (va) is a technique for measuring the cause-specific mortality burden for deaths that occur outside of hospitals.further, metrics of individual concordance need to be corrected for chance to adequately capture how well a method does over random or equal assignment across causes.we conducted an extensive sensitivity analysis to understand the importance of decisions between levels of tariff-based item reduction, the choice of number of signs and symptoms at every decision node (m), the choice of number of trees (n) in each one-versus-one cause classification, and the difference between max-score and max-rank cause assignment.in addition, using machine learning leads to reliability, since the same interview responses will lead to the same cause assignment every time.
