we applied random forests to determine a good classifier based on a subset of our loci and determined that combined use of the same four top markers allows identification of lung cancer tissue from non-lung cancer tissue with 94% sensitivity and 90% specificity.

while these dna methylation markers are ultimately intended for the non-invasive analysis of patient bodily fluids, a preliminary indication of their potential to sensitively and specifically detect cancer could be obtained by plotting roc curves using the pmr values from the tumor vs. adjacent non-tumor samples.

in an analysis of eight adenocarcinomas and matching adjacent lung, substantial dna methylation of the hoxa and d clusters was observed[26].
this can happen when genes are very heavily methylated in the cancer sample, while the sssi-treated sample (in spite of extensivein vitro dna methylation) is not fully methylated at that locus.
in addition, all four markers remained significantly hypermethylated in tumor vs. adjntl when subjects were stratified by gender or by ethnic group (p < 0.05) (table3).
ages ranged from 37–82 years old at time of surgery (median: 58 years old).
kds oversaw statistical analysis and drafted statistical sections of the manuscript.
dna methylation of these loci did not differ significantly based on gender, race, age or tumor stage, indicating their wide applicability as potential lung adenocarcinoma markers.
using bootstrap samples of the data, we grew a forest of 30,000 trees.
the ability of the top four candidates, cdkn2a ex2, cdx2, hoxa1 and opcml (all p < 1 × 10-9), to individually identify lung cancer samples was next evaluated.

in lung cancer patients, such hypermethylation is detectable in a variety of samples ranging from tumor material to blood and sputum.
all studies were institutionally approved by the university of southern california institutional review board (irb# hs-016041, hs-06-00447), and the identities of patients were not made available to laboratory investigators.
the paired adjntl form an exquisite control for the cancer-specific nature of the observed dna methylation changes, as each of these samples conforms to its tumor sample in patient age, environmental exposure, and genetic background.
discussion based on the results of our analyses, four loci that are very strong candidates for a dna methylation panel aimed at early lung adenocarcinoma detection have been identified: cdkn2a ex2, cdx2, hoxa1 and opcml.
nine loci, cdh13, sfrp1, opcml, twist1, sfrp5, cdkn2a ex2, cdx2, hoxa1 and rassf1, clustered together (bottom right), showing heavier dna methylation in the tumor samples.
interestingly, for one locus, lzts1 (leftmost locus in fig.1), the dna methylation pattern appeared to be reversed; ntl showed the highest level of dna methylation, while ad samples were least methylated.
very recently, high throughput dna methylation profiling of 11 lung adenocarcinomas and control lung identified a number of cpg dinucleotides methylated in the cancer samples[32].
apc methylation was found to be statistically significantly different only when paired tumor and non-tumor lung samples were compared.

the identification of eight cpg island loci showing highly significant hypermethylation in lung adenocarcinoma provides strong candidates for evaluation in patient remote media such as plasma and sputum.
to ensure that these markers detect cancer-specifichypermethylation changes, associated with histologically visible lung cancer (allowing surgical resection), we compared the dna methylation profiles of the tumors with histologically normal adjacent lung tissue (adjntl) from lung cancer patients.

distribution according to histologic type and outcome by gender and age group in taiwanese patients with lung carcinoma.
conclusion the identification of eight cpg island loci showing highly significant hypermethylation in lung adenocarcinoma provides strong candidates for evaluation in patient remote media such as plasma and sputum.
all of these except cdh1 remained significant when ad samples were compared to adjntl, while all except lzts1 remained significant in the comparison of ad to paired adjntl.
dna methylation of hox genes, encoding homeobox transcription factors involved in embryogenesis and differentiation, had recently been observed in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung cancer.
dna methylation of these loci did not differ significantly based on gender, race, age or tumor stage, indicating their wide applicability as potential lung adenocarcinoma markers.
among others, the 28 loci included cpg islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes and genes with important roles in cell cycle regulation, dna repair, and apoptosis (table1).
dna hypermethylation at promoter cpg islands shows great promise as a cancer-specific marker that would complement visual lung cancer screening tools such as spiral ct, improving early detection.
three quarters of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with regionally or distantly disseminated disease; their 5-year survival is only 15%.
authors' contributions jat was involved in marker design, experimental execution and initial analysis.
thirteen of the analyzed loci showed statistically significant differences in dna methylation when ad samples were compared to all ntl samples: opcml, cdx2, hoxa1, cdkn2a ex2, sfrp1, cdh13, twist1, lzts1, rassf1, sfrp4 and 5, esr1, and cdh1.
a recent analysis of prospectively collected sputum showed cdkn2a methylation in 39% of cases and 25% of controls; methylation of this gene was associated with an elevated risk of lung cancer[20].
for the comparison of paired ad and adjntl samples from the same patients, the wilcoxon signed rank test was used.
thus, we suggest that cdkn2a ex2, cdx2, hoxa1 and opcml are the top candidates from the 28 tested, and should be validated as dna methylation markers for lung adenocarcinoma.
here we demonstrate that hoxa1 is a very promising dna methylation marker for lung adenocarcinoma.
st helped locate and section most of the tissues and provided the linked and de-identified clinicopathological information.
the percentage methylated reference (pmr) was calculated as the gene:reference ratio of a sample divided by the gene:reference ratio ofin vitro methylated ( sssi-treated) human white blood cell dna and multiplying by 100 [14].
these adjacent non-tumor lung samples were supplemented with 6 additional cancer-free archival samples from lung cancer patients for which the tumor block was unavailable, and 11 archival non-tumor lung samples from patients operated for non-cancer reasons, such as pneumothorax or emphysema.
reducing the locus number to 13 did not affect sensitivity and specificity, and limiting our markers to the top-ranked four (hoxa1, opcml, cdkn2aex2 and cdx2, which were also the most significant based on our statistical analysis) resulted in a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 90%.
in fact, methylation of the cdkn2a promoter cpg island has been observed in the sputum of subjects at risk for lung cancer 3 years prior to diagnosis[18] and in the sputum of asymptomatic heavy smokers[19].
to make an impact on long term survival, better strategies are needed for early detection.
molecular analyses of plasma, sputum, and bronchial lavage fluids have also shown promise as strategies for early detection, but these methods still lack sensitivity[10].
this suggests that basal dna methylation is high but variable at this locus; elevated dna methylation in tumors is likely masked by interpatient variability and only becomes visible when samples from the same patient are compared.
dna methylation analysis dna methylation analysis was done by methylight as previously described [14 ].
a loss of sensitivity might be foreseen due to the small amounts of dna shed into the blood of each patient, but at the same time, an increase in specificity might be expected if tumor dna is shed more readily into the bloodstream than dna from adjacent histologically normal tissue.
jsg was involved in experimental execution and extensive data analysis, drafting the manuscript, and generation of figures.
environmental exposures, such as those arising from tobacco smoke, could lead to higher basal levels of methylation in non-tumor lung[12], which might affect the background signal when any resulting markers are applied to non-invasive molecular analyses of bodily fluids in the future.
it is thought that dna methylation observed in the sputum is indicative of field cancerization of the airways and not necessarily a symptom of a present cancer[20].
while each of the four top-ranked loci is of interest as a dna methylation marker, it is as apanel that they promise to be most powerful.
importantly, all four markers were significantly hypermethylated in stage ia cancers.
one probe identified dna methylation in the area covered by the opcml probe used here.
in lung cancer patients, such hypermethylation is detectable in a variety of samples ranging from tumor material to blood and sputum.
while substantial methylation at the exon 2 cpg island is detected in histologically normal adjntl, by comparison, dna methylation in adenocarcinoma is highly significantly elevated (p ≤ 1 × 10e-10).
recent results from the early lung cancer action project (elcap) indicate that this approach allows detection of early stage lung cancer[8], but in this and other studies, non-cancerous lesions far outnumber malignancies (less than 10% of lesions are cancer).
note that for all four markers, the mean value in non-tumor lung fromnon-cancer patients is lower than that of adjacent non-tumor lung fromlung cancer patients.
the dna was bisulfite converted as previously described[13].
all but one of the tumor samples clustered together in a major branch of the dendrogram, while the majority of non-tumor lung samples grouped in a separate cluster.
in the center, dna methylation levels are indicated by a color gradient, with the highest dna methylation levels for each locus indicated in red and the lowest in deep blue.
however, the biological consequences of the observed hypermethylation would also be worth investigating.
hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides were reviewed by an experienced lung pathologist (mnk) to support the original classification of the tumor and to select optimal tumor and non-tumor areas of the specimens.
dna was extracted from microdissected tumor and non-tumor lung samples via proteinase k digestion[ 35].
importantly, all four markers were significantly hypermethylated in stage ia cancers.
dna methylation of hox genes, encoding homeobox transcription factors involved in embryogenesis and differentiation, had recently been observed in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung cancer.
a recent analysis suggests spiral ct screening may not reduce lung cancer mortality[9].
briefly, cells were lysed in a solution containing 100 mmol/l tris-hcl (ph 8.0), 10 mmol/l edta (ph 8.0), 1 mg/ml proteinase k, and 0.05 mg/ml trna and incubated at 50°c overnight.
given the histopathologic, clinical and molecular differences between lung cancer subtypes, we believe that markers should be developed individually for the major histological subtypes.
this does not affect the significance of the loci identified in this study, as the same batch ofsssi-treated dna was used throughout the study.
we determined error rates using the observations that were not used to generate the trees.
the detection of cdkn2a methylation in a high fraction of lung cancer patient plasma samples bodes well for its application to non-invasive detection[23].

only cdkn2a ex2 hypermethylation was significant in stage ib tumors, but this could be due to the small number of paired samples (n = 6).
because of the costs associated with quantitative molecular analyses, it would be important to limit the number of markers included in the panel.
quantitative assessment of dna methylation levels allows a more detailed evaluation of candidate dna methylation markers, and of their suitability for correctly identifying a cancer vs. non-cancer sample.
fig.4 shows that the area under the curve (auc, and indicator of marker performance that would be 1 for a marker showing 100% specificity and sensitivty) is 0.87–0.95 for the four top loci.
while the population analyzed in the current study is small, we reasoned that an indication of the potential of our top four markers to broadly identify lung adenocarcinoma might be obtained.
to avoid assigning statistical significance to spurious associations, we incorporated a multiple comparisons threshold for those loci that at time of analysis lacked any prior data suggesting they might be hypermethylated in lung adenocarcinoma (table2, before-last column, [15] see materials and methods for details).
here we demonstrate that hoxa1 is a very promising dna methylation marker for lung adenocarcinoma.
frequency and median pmr values of ad, adj ntl and ntl tissues for 28 loci of the thirteen significant loci, opcml, cdx2, hoxa1, cdkn2a ex2, sfrp1, cdh13, twist1 and rassf1 show considerable promise as cancer-specific dna methylation markers, exhibiting highly significant hypermethylation in tumors compared to paired non-tumor tissues (p ≤ 1 × 10-7, table 2).
st helped locate and section most of the tissues and provided the linked and de-identified clinicopathological information.
mnk reviewed all slides prior to microdissection.
the relationship of samples is indicated at right in the same color schematic as the labels.
potential "remote" media to be considered are sputum, bronchioalveolar lavage, and blood plasma, all of which we are in the process of collecting for examination.
to our knowledge, cdkn2a ex2, cdx2, hoxa1 and opcml constitute the strongest lung adenocarcinoma dna methylation markers identified to date, and we are working on further evaluations of their potential with great anticipation.
we also included many loci that appeared promising based on previous reports describing their dna methylation in lung cancer or other cancers, so that all markers of interest could be compared on one set of tissues using a single technique and platform.
dna hypermethylation occurs in all cancers, frequently leading to gene silencing through methylation of cpg-rich regions (cpg islands) near the transcriptional start sites of genes[11 ].
despite the promising auc values, the sensitivity and specificity of these top four markers, usedindividually and determined using the current sample collection in a five-fold cross-validation, was limited: 67–86% and 74–82% respectively.
receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves were plotted using the ad vs. all adjntl lung pmr values and jmp 6.0 software (sas institute, cary, nc).
we find it to be methylated in 100% of lung adenocarcinomas, showing a 10-fold higher median methylation than adjntl tissue (table2).
given that opioids have demonstrated growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects in lung cancer cells[29 -31], it is perhaps not surprising that the opcml promoter cpg island might be a target for dna methylation in lung cancer.
molecular analyses of plasma, sputum, and bronchial lavage fluids have also shown promise as strategies for early detection, but these methods still lack sensitivity[10].
quantitative assessment of dna methylation levels allows a more detailed evaluation of candidate dna methylation markers, and of their suitability for correctly identifying a cancer vs. non-cancer sample.
the ward hierarchical clustering method was used to categorize between cancer and non-tumor samples.
these markers can later be combined into a lung cancer hypermethylation panel that can be used for detection of all lung cancers.
for this reason, we used the bisulfite conversion based real-time pcr technique, methylight, to measure dna methylation in tumor and control tissues[13].

reducing the locus number to 13 did not affect sensitivity and specificity, and limiting our markers to the top-ranked four (hoxa1, opcml, cdkn2aex2 and cdx2, which were also the most significant based on our statistical analysis) resulted in a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 90%.

these analyses indicate that the top four markers show high potential for identification of lung adenocarcinoma, even in its earliest stages, an important characteristic if these markers are to be used for early detection.
clinical information was missing for 5 patients.
thus, we suggest that cdkn2a ex2, cdx2, hoxa1 and opcml are the top candidates from the 28 tested, and should be validated as dna methylation markers for lung adenocarcinoma.

this emphasizes the importance of using histologically normal tissue adjacent to lung cancer for comparison; such tissue may show higher basal dna methylation levels while appearing histologically normal, and should be used for comparison with lung cancer tissue to ensure identification ofcancer-specific markers.

this does not affect the significance of the loci identified in this study, as the same batch ofsssi-treated dna was used throughout the study.
all ad and adjntl lung samples for which there was complete dna methylation data were used for the analysis.
dna hypermethylation at promoter cpg islands shows great promise as a cancer-specific marker that would complement visual lung cancer screening tools such as spiral ct, improving early detection.
to address the first question, we assessed correlations to age and determined whether each of the four markers showed statistically significant hypermethylation in tumor vs. adjacent normal tissues in men, women, and all four racial/ethnic groups.
lung adenocarcinoma and when available adjacent non-tumor lung was obtained from archival paraffin blocks from 51 subjects who had been treated at three los angeles hospitals: the los angeles county hospital, the usc university hospital and the norris comprehensive cancer center.
the ability of our four-marker panel to clinically detect lung cancer with high sensitivity and specificity will depend on many factors.
although the exposure history of these ntl samples is unknown, their generally lower dna methylation levels emphasize that these samples may not be the best controls when searching for loci that show cancer-specific hypermethylation.
we also examined non-tumor lung from non-cancer patients (ntl).
the four most highly ranked loci, cdkn2a ex2, cdx2, hoxa1 and opcml, which show significant dna methylation even in stage ia tumor samples, merit further investigation as some of the most promising lung adenocarcinoma markers identified to date.
dna was extracted from microdissected tumor and non-tumor lung samples via proteinase k digestion[ 35].
thus, these four markers appear to be highly promising dna hypermethylation markers for development into non-invasive molecular markers of lung adenocarcinoma, through examination of dna shed into bodily fluids such as sputum, bronchioalveolar lavage, or blood.
indeed, waki and coworkers have observed frequent dna methylation of apc in non-cancer lung and other organs[16].
in fact, methylation of the cdkn2a promoter cpg island has been observed in the sputum of subjects at risk for lung cancer 3 years prior to diagnosis[18] and in the sputum of asymptomatic heavy smokers[19].
the 5-year survival of lung cancer patients is only 15%, largely due to the fact that three quarters of lung cancer patients are diagnosed when their disease has spread regionally or distantly[7].
in lung cancer patients, such hypermethylation is quantitatively detectable in a variety of samples ranging from tumor material to blood and sputum[10].
vhl, which was negative in all specimens, was omitted from the clustering analysis.
while all four markers show increased dna methylation in adenocarcinoma compared to adjacent non-tumor tissue, the spread of dna methylation levels differs, which would affect their sensitivity and specificity in future detection strategies.
gene name and function of the 28 loci studied the results of the dna methylation analyses for the 28 loci in 51 ad, 38 adjntl and 11 ntl samples are shown in fig.1.
because our primary goal is marker development, here we focused only on whether loci showed consistent hypermethylation.
despite the promising auc values, the sensitivity and specificity of these top four markers, usedindividually and determined using the current sample collection in a five-fold cross-validation, was limited: 67–86% and 74–82% respectively.
because of its increasing frequency and its preponderance in non- and previous smokers, we focused first on lung adenocarcinoma (ad).
of the many potential molecular markers, dna hypermethylation – an epigenetic alteration – shows great promise.
we applied two-dimensional hierarchical clustering to examine the relationship between the loci and the tumor and non-tumor lung samples (fig2; vhl was omitted because it showed no dna methylation in any samples).
acknowledgements the authors thank members of the laird lab for help with methylight and probe/primer design, and laird-offringa lab members for critical comments on the manuscript.
the marker potential of quantitative markers is frequently presented in the form of a receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve, in which sensitivity vs. 1-specificity at all possible cut-off values is plotted.
a loss of sensitivity might be foreseen due to the small amounts of dna shed into the blood of each patient, but at the same time, an increase in specificity might be expected if tumor dna is shed more readily into the bloodstream than dna from adjacent histologically normal tissue.
in addition to primers and probe sets designed specifically for the gene of interest, an internal reference primer and probe set designed to analyze alu repeats (alu) was included in the analysis to normalize for input dna[38].
adenocarcinoma is also the most common lung cancer subtype in non- and previous smokers[6].
given that opioids have demonstrated growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects in lung cancer cells[29 -31]
our analyses of the present sample collection, which contains modest numbers of representatives from all these groups, is very encouraging as they suggest that the markers function independently of subject age, gender or ethnic subgroup, and are positive in early stage cancer.
in a different study, analysis of a stage i adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung carcinoma showed dna methylation of the hox clusters, and examination of the hoxa and d clusters in more detail in squamous cell cancers and control tissue indicated a dna methylation frequency of 45–80% for hoxa7-9, but methylation of hoxa1 was limited[27].
if molecular markers with high sensitivity and specificity for cancers that will progress can be identified, such markers could be combined with spiral ct to screen high-risk individuals, allowing molecular detection and visualization of clinically relevant early lesions.
associations between age, gender and race of ad cases were tested by dichotomizing the subjects either by the presence/absence of dna methylation, or, if the samples were frequently methylated, by the median of all positive pmr values.
based on the results of our analyses, four loci that are very strong candidates for a dna methylation panel aimed at early lung adenocarcinoma detection have been identified: cdkn2a ex2, cdx2, hoxa1 and opcml.
it allows detailed imaging of the lung, and can detect very small lesions.
in addition to primers and probe sets designed specifically for the gene of interest, an internal reference primer and probe set designed to analyze alu repeats (alu) was included in the analysis to normalize for input dna[38].
these markers can later be combined into a lung cancer hypermethylation panel that can be used for detection of all lung cancers.
the four most significant markers also ranked as the top four to be used in a marker panel, as determined by a random forest approach.
however, the biological consequences of the observed hypermethylation would also be worth investigating.
the adjntl sections were derived from separate, histologically verified cancer-free paraffin blocks.

results ideal dna hypermethylation markers for lung adenocarcinoma should show a high frequency of methylation in tumors as well as dna methylation levels that are significantly elevated in tumor compared to non-tumor lung tissue.
to date the penetrance of dna methylation at any single locus has been too low to provide great clinical sensitivity.
because of its increasing frequency and its preponderance in non- and previous smokers, we focused first on lung adenocarcinoma (ad).
the ability of our four-marker panel to clinically detect lung cancer with high sensitivity and specificity will depend on many factors.
the only exception was cdkn2a ex2 methylation in asian subjects (p = 0.11), which may be related to the small sample size but will need to be further explored.
thus, these four markers appear to be highly promising dna hypermethylation markers for development into non-invasive molecular markers of lung adenocarcinoma, through examination of dna shed into bodily fluids such as sputum, bronchioalveolar lavage, or blood.
performance of top four markers in samples based on gender, race/ethnicity and stage to address the second question, we determined whether each of the four markers was significantly hypermethylated in early and later stage tumors, using paired samples (table3).
potential "remote" media to be considered are sputum, bronchioalveolar lavage, and blood plasma, all of which we are in the process of collecting for examination.
five cancer samples showed dna methylation of hoxa1, while only one adjntl sample was methylated at this locus.
in a different study, analysis of a stage i adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung carcinoma showed dna methylation of the hox clusters, and examination of the hoxa and d clusters in more detail in squamous cell cancers and control tissue indicated a dna methylation frequency of 45–80% for hoxa7-9, but methylation of hoxa1 was limited[27].
the ward hierarchical clustering method was used to categorize between cancer and non-tumor samples.
of the many potential molecular markers, dna hypermethylation – an epigenetic alteration – shows great promise.
the differences between the obtained results might be due to the examination of a different cpg island or a different population.
our focus is to increase the repertoire of sensitive dna hypermethylation markers for lung cancer, and to compose a small panel of molecular markers that could be used to detect lung cancer with high sensitivity and specificity.
vhl, which was negative in all specimens, was omitted from the clustering analysis.
for this reason, we used the bisulfite conversion based real-time pcr technique, methylight, to measure dna methylation in tumor and control tissues[13].
fig.3 shows the distribution of pmr values in the examined sample collection.
to our knowledge, we are the first to examine cdkn2a ex2, cdx2, hoxa1 and opcml in combination.
environmental exposures, such as those arising from tobacco smoke, could lead to higher basal levels of methylation in non-tumor lung[12], which might affect the background signal when any resulting markers are applied to non-invasive molecular analyses of bodily fluids in the future.
the four most highly ranked loci, cdkn2a ex2, cdx2, hoxa1 and opcml, which show significant dna methylation even in stage ia tumor samples, merit further investigation as some of the most promising lung adenocarcinoma markers identified to date.
however, to date the penetrance of dna methylation at any single locus has not been high enough to provide great clinical sensitivity.
very recently, high throughput dna methylation profiling of 11 lung adenocarcinomas and control lung identified a number of cpg dinucleotides methylated in the cancer samples[32].
using bootstrap samples of the data, we grew a forest of 30,000 trees.
clinical information was missing for 5 patients.
dna methylation, expressed as the percentage methylated reference (pmr[14]) is visualized by color coding.
using the gini index from the random forest classifier (last column, table2) to measure locus importance, we restricted our analysis to the most highly ranked variables.
we had evaluated dna methylation of the cdkn2a promoter cpg island as a cancer indicator, but found substantial dna methylation in adjntl, and no significant difference between adjntl and cancer (data not shown).
we have also observed dna methylation of additional hox genes (unpublished studies), but hoxa1 appears to be particularly informative.
while these dna methylation markers are ultimately intended for the non-invasive analysis of patient bodily fluids, a preliminary indication of their potential to sensitively and specifically detect cancer could be obtained by plotting roc curves using the pmr values from the tumor vs. adjacent non-tumor samples.
all of these except cdh1 remained significant when ad samples were compared to adjntl, while all except lzts1 remained significant in the comparison of ad to paired adjntl.
we also examined a number of non-tumor lung (ntl) samples from patients operated for non-cancer reasons (emphysema, lung collapse, etc.).

for 32 of these cases, a separate paraffin block containing histologically verified cancer-free lung was available.
a recent analysis of prospectively collected sputum showed cdkn2a methylation in 39% of cases and 25% of controls; methylation of this gene was associated with an elevated risk of lung cancer[20].
comparison of ad in fig.1 panel a with adjntl in panel b shows that a number of loci are more heavily methylated in ad.
among others, the 28 loci included cpg islands in the promoters of tumor suppressor genes and genes with important roles in cell cycle regulation, dna repair, and apoptosis (table1).
prior experience with chest x-ray, sputum cytology, and fiberoptic examination have failed to decrease lung cancer patient mortality, although several recent strategies show promise.
if molecular markers with high sensitivity and specificity for cancers that will progress can be identified, such markers could be combined with spiral ct to screen high-risk individuals, allowing molecular detection and visualization of clinically relevant early lesions.

jah provided non-cancer lung samples and statistical discussions.
we found no correlation of methylation of cdkn2a ex2, cdx2, hoxa1 and opcml with the age.
to ensure that these markers detect cancer-specifichypermethylation changes, associated with histologically visible lung cancer (allowing surgical resection), we compared the dna methylation profiles of the tumors with histologically normal adjacent lung tissue (adjntl) from lung cancer patients.
associations between age, gender and race of ad cases were tested by dichotomizing the subjects either by the presence/absence of dna methylation, or, if the samples were frequently methylated, by the median of all positive pmr values.
ialo designed the study, oversaw all aspects of the project, mentored jat and jsg, and revised manuscript drafts.
pwl provided experimental advice and mentoring for jat.
our analyses of the present sample collection, which contains modest numbers of representatives from all these groups, is very encouraging as they suggest that the markers function independently of subject age, gender or ethnic subgroup, and are positive in early stage cancer.
fig.4 shows that the area under the curve (auc, and indicator of marker performance that would be 1 for a marker showing 100% specificity and sensitivty) is 0.87–0.95 for the four top loci.
to determine which combinations of markers would be most effective to correctly identify tumor vs. non-tumor samples, we fit a random forest classifier to the data set, using 87 samples and 28 variables (2 ad samples with missing pmr data were omitted, resulting in 49 ad vs. 38 adjntl).
we next analyzed the statistical significance of the differences in dna methylation levels for individual markers and different combinations of tissue samples (table2): ad vs. all ntl samples, ad vs. adjntl, and ad vs. paired adjntl (32 of the 38 adjntl samples were derived from the ad patients in fig.1a).

ages ranged from 37–82 years old at time of surgery (median: 58 years old).
prior experience with chest x-ray, sputum cytology, and fiberoptic examination have failed to decrease lung cancer patient mortality, although several recent strategies show promise.
we applied random forests to determine a good classifier based on a subset of our loci and determined that combined use of the same four top markers allows identification of lung cancer tissue from non-lung cancer tissue with 94% sensitivity and 90% specificity.
to our knowledge, cdkn2a ex2, cdx2, hoxa1 and opcml constitute the strongest lung adenocarcinoma dna methylation markers identified to date, and we are working on further evaluations of their potential with great anticipation.
note that for all four markers, the mean value in non-tumor lung fromnon-cancer patients is lower than that of adjacent non-tumor lung fromlung cancer patients.
gene name and function of the 28 loci studied the results of the dna methylation analyses for the 28 loci in 51 ad, 38 adjntl and 11 ntl samples are shown in fig.1.
only cdkn2a ex2 hypermethylation was significant in stage ib tumors, but this could be due to the small number of paired samples (n = 6).
this supports the notion that dna hypermethylation markers are best used in the form of a panel.
while all four markers show increased dna methylation in adenocarcinoma compared to adjacent non-tumor tissue, the spread of dna methylation levels differs, which would affect their sensitivity and specificity in future detection strategies.
all ad and adjntl lung samples for which there was complete dna methylation data were used for the analysis.

for the comparison of paired ad and adjntl samples from the same patients, the wilcoxon signed rank test was used.
, it is perhaps not surprising that the opcml promoter cpg island might be a target for dna methylation in lung cancer.
the only exception was cdkn2a ex2 methylation in asian subjects (p = 0.11), which may be related to the small sample size but will need to be further explored.
we also included many loci that appeared promising based on previous reports describing their dna methylation in lung cancer or other cancers, so that all markers of interest could be compared on one set of tissues using a single technique and platform.
