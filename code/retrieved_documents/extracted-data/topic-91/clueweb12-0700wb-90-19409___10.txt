machine learning is the ability of a machine to improve its performance based on its past performance, to then be used for prediction or classification purposes.
statistics tended to focus on problems such as the limit convergence of estimators until brieman, friedman, olshen and stone, and later hastie and tibshirani.
stochastic discrimination, random forests and boosting tend to form more  accurate classifiers than decision trees alone, since they are able to better  capture the true structure of the data.
the weak classifiers are assigned  at random and checked to see if they conform to: encouragement (they predict better than 50%) thickness (they generalise to new examples in the class) non-special (adjustments to equalise coverage of easy and hard-to-classify  points) a similar technique, which is an example of stochastic discrimination but  was invented separately by leo breiman, is 'random forests'.
