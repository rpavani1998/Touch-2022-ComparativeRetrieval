these results suggest that svms can function as an efficient gait classifier for recognition of young and elderly gait patterns, and has the potential for wider applications in gait identification for falls-risk minimization in the elderly.support vector machine (svm), a novel type of learning machine based on statistical learning theory, can be used for regression and time series prediction and have been reported to perform well by some promising results.automated recognition of gait changes has many advantages including, early identification of at-risk gait and monitoring the progress of treatment outcomes.forward-selection and backward-elimination methodology further improved the classification rate and also has the potential to reduce testing time by diminishing the number of visual-field location measurements.machine learning classifiers can learn complex patterns and trends in data and adapt to create a decision surface without the constraints imposed by statistical classifiers.we anticipate that this automation framework will be generally applicable to the generation and evaluation of large numbers of mhc predictive methods and tools, and will be of value to centralize and rationalize the process of evaluation of mhc predictions.once these predictive models have been validated, they can be used as an automated prediction tool for virtual high-throughput screening (vhts).generative classifiers, which first model the data probability density and then perform classification via bayes' rule, usually give deeper insight into the structure of the data space.the accurate models for air pollutant prediction are needed because such models would allow forecasting and diagnosing potential compliance or non-compliance in both short- and long-term aspects.using cross-validation, we demonstrate that svms can be trained on relatively small data sets to provide prediction more accurate than those based on previously published methods or on mhc binding.both the statistical and the classification results have proven the explicit correlation of all the selected features with the final diagnosis, qualifying them as an adequate input base for any type of similar automated diagnosis system.these data indicate that valid predictions could be made based on gene expression changes from a small set of expression profiles.these problems become magnified with automatic modelling processes, as there is no human input to correct mistakes.recently, gene expression profiling using dna microarrays has been shown to be a viable and accurate diagnostic tool to identify the known prognostically important all subtypes.without prior explicit bias almost all of these clustering methods applied to gene expression data not only produce different results, but may also produce clusters with little or no biological relevance.
