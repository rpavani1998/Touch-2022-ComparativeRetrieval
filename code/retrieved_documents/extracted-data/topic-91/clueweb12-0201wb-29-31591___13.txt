crfs outperform both memms and hmms on a number of real-world tasks in many fields, including bioinformatics, computational linguistics and speech recognition.
the primary advantage  of crfs over hidden markov models is their conditional nature, resulting in the  relaxation of the independence assumptions required by hmms in order to ensure  tractable inference.
