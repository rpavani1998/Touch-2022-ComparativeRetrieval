the experimental results show that these algorithms perform competitively with previously published results for the datasets used, while often exhibiting lower runtime than other tested systems.this demonstrates that sufficient information for classification and clustering is retained in the rule generation process and that learning with random rules is efficient.the results show that the inclusion of spatial relationships leads to a measurable increase in performance for two of the most challenging datasets.experimental results also demonstrate that the new algorithms are competitive with existing approaches on real-world problems.the new algorithms are shown to achieve better root mean squared error rates than existing approaches on artificial data generated according to the underlying assumptions.they offer the advantage to provide sound, probabilistic scores.propositionalisation allows single-table algorithms for classification and clustering to be applied to the resulting data, reducing the amount of relational processing required.experimental results show that our methods produce competitive results.further results show that techniques for utilising additional unlabeled training data improve accuracy of classification in the semi-supervised setting.the results from experimental evaluation on a variety of multi-label datasets show that [e]ps can achieve better performance and train much faster than other multi-label methods.randomization based on random relational rules can work both with and without a class attribute and can therefore be applied simultaneously to both the labeled and the unlabeled portion of the data present in semi-supervised learning.this allows the classification process to inherently take into account correlations between labels.continuous learning is able to improve the performance achieved with static models but the rate of improvement drops over time and the computer player is still unable to beat the opponent.this indicates a need for algorithms that can operate efficiently on relational data and exploit the larger body of work produced in the area of single-table techniques.the assumption is that random rules enable efficient and effective relational learning, and this thesis presents evidence that this is indeed the case.
