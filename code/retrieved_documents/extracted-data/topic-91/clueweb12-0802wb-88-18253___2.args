segmentation and recognition using structure from motion point clouds.
in this tutorial, we review boosting and random forest and present comparative studies with insightful discussions.
a boosting classifier has been so successful owing to its fast computation and yet comparable accuracy to kernel methods, being a standard method in related fields over past decades.

toshiba research europe ltd cambridge, uk bjorn.stenger[at]crl.toshiba.co.uk abstract many visual recognition tasks such as object tracking, detection and segmentation favour fast and yet accurate classification methods.

tracking using online feature selection and a local generative model.
boosting as a representative ensemble learning method, which aggregates simple weak learners, can be seen as a flat tree structure when each learner is a decision-stump.

the classification speed is not just a matter of time-efficiency but is often crucial to achieve good accuracy, which is manifest in e.g. tracking problems.

it is also pertinent for online learning for adaptation and tracking.

the flat structure ensures reasonably smooth decision regions for good generalisation, however, is not optimal in classification time.
a hierarchical structure having many short paths, i.e. a decision tree, is advantageous in speed but is notoriously bad at generalisation.
standard kernel machines e.g. support vector machine and gaussian process classifier are slow and methods for rapid classification have been pursued.
