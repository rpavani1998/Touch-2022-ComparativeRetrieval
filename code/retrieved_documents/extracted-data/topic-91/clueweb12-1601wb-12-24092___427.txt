social  simulation using a multi-agent model based on classifier systems:
the type of cognitive system (cs) studied here has four basic parts: (1) a set of interacting elementary productions, called classifiers, (2) a performance algorithm that directs the action of the system in the environment, (3) a simple learning algorithm that keeps a record of each classifier's success in bringing about rewards, and (4) a more complex learning algorithm, called the genetic algorithm, that modifies the set of classifiers so that variants of good classifiers persist and new, potentially better ones are created in a provably efficient manner.
