in supervised data mining scenarios.
abstract data mining is an important process, with applications found in many  business, science and industrial problems.
the first method is based on encoding rule sets with bit string genomes and the second one utilizes genetic programming to create decision trees with arbitrary expressions attached to the nodes.
we further demonstrate that both proposed approaches work well  across different configurations of the eas.
data mining is an important process, with applications found in many business, science and industrial problems.
while a wide variety of algorithms have already been proposed in the literature for classification tasks in large data sets, and the majority of them have been proven to be very effective, not all of them are flexible and easily extensible.

while a wide variety of algorithms  have already been proposed in the literature for classification tasks in large  data sets, and the majority of them have been proven to be very effective, not  all of them are flexible and easily extensible.
comparisons with some sophisticated standard approaches, such as c4.5 and  random-forest, show that the performance of the evolved classifiers can be very  competitive.
