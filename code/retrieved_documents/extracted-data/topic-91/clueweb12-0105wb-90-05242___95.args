number the vertices from1 to n. let be the shortest path from i to j using only vertices from 1, 2,...,k as possible intermediate vertices.
listening to part 8-2 9.1-4 show that the lower bound for sorting still holds with ternary comparisons.
besides, the asymptotic answer won't change so long the fraction is less than one.
making a heuristic more complicated does not necessarily make it better.
properly compressed, the full semester's audio requires less than 300 megabytes of storage, which is much less than i would have imagined.
if we were allowed to visit cities more than once, doing a depth-first traversal of a mst, and then walking out the tour specified is at most twice the cost of mst.
if you have an algorithm which runs in time, take it, because this is blindingly fast even on very large instances.
this suggests a dynamic programming-like strategy, where we store the distance froms to all nearby nodes, and use them to find the shortest path to more distant nodes.
listening to part 8-3 binary search trees ``i think that i shall never see a poem as lovely as a tree poem's are wrote by fools like me but only g-d can make a tree `` - joyce kilmer binary search trees provide a data structure which efficiently supports all six dictionary operations.
assuming the initialization for substring matching, we seek the cheapest matching of the full pattern ending anywhere in the text.
np observe that any ndtm program which takes time p(n) can simulated in time on a deterministic machine, by running the checking program times, once on each possible guessed string.

read polya's book how to solve it.
with the implicit tree defined by array positions, (i.e. the ith position is the parent of the2ith and (2i+1)st positions) the leaves start out as heaps.
no boolean variable and its complement will both be true, so it is a legal assignment with also must satisfy the clauses.
an implementation of dijkstra's algorithm would be faster for sparse graphs, and comes from using a heap of the vertices (ordered by distance), and updating the distance to each vertex (if necessary) in time for each edge out from freshly known vertices.
to enable the robot arm to do a soldering job, we must construct an ordering of the contact points, so the robot visits (and solders) the first contact point, then visits the second point, third, and so forth until the job is done.
knowing the dominance relation between common functions is important because we want algorithms whose time complexity is as low as possible in the hierarchy.
however, we will not use it much in proving the efficiency of our algorithms, since the worst-case time is unpredictable.
after adding a vertex to the tree, running through its adjacency list to update the cost of adding fringe vertices (there may be a cheaper way through the new vertex) can be done ino(n) time.
for the traveling salesman, we can check if the points lie on a line, and if so output the points in that order.
if we could do convex hull in better than , we could sort faster than - which violates our lower bound.
observe that any convex hull algorithm also gives us a complicated but correct sorting algorithm as well.
thus we cannot go wrong with the greedy strategy the way we could with the traveling salesman problem.
integer partition in s vc in gany solution tos must contain exactly k vertex/numbers.
further since neighboring points on the convex hull have neighboringx values, the convex hull returns the points sorted byx-coordinate, ie.
(again, the prevention of carrys across digits prevents any other possibilites).
specifically, each piece can threaten a certain maximum number of squares (queen 27, king 8, rook 14, etc.)
ex: the traveling salesman problem the guessing module can easily write a permutation of the vertices in polynomial time.
we can run dijkstra's algorithm n times (once from each possible start vertex) to solve all-pairs shortest path problem in .
my favorites are: listening to part 26-7 you are trying to translate one problem into another, while making them stay the same as much as possible.
we can only usek x vertex/numbers, because of the high order digit of the target.
note that time complexity is every bit as well defined a function as or you bank account as a function of time.
cook's theorem proved satisfiability was np-hard by using a polynomial time reduction translating each problem innp into an instance of sat: since a polynomial time algorithm for sat would imply a polynomial time algorithm for everything innp, sat is np -hard.
another idea would be to repeatedly connect the closest pair of points whose connection will not cause a cycle or a three-way branch to be formed, until we have a single chain with all the points in it.
to convince ourselves it really is an answer, we can run another program to check it.
deletion in an open addressing scheme is ugly, since removing one element can break a chain of insertions, making some elements inaccessible.
as you can see, the reductions can be very clever and very complicated.
dynamic programming works best on objects which are linearly ordered and cannot be rearranged - characters in a string, matrices in a chain, points around the boundary of a polygon, the left-to-right order of leaves in a search tree.
red-black trees are binary search trees where each node is assigned a color, where the coloring scheme helps us maintain the height as .
a faster algorithm running on a slower computer will always win for sufficiently large instances, as we shall see.
unfortunately, because we won't have the full matrix we cannot reconstruct the alignment, as above.
since the set of3-sat instances is smaller and more regular than thesat instances, it will be easier to use 3 -sat for future reductions.
thus we need a data structure for maintaining sets which can test if two elements are in the same and merge two sets together.
this is the first and easiest place to go wrong.
the translation was initiated by algorithms on mon jun 2 09:21:39 edt 1997 algorithms
by analyzing the bit patterns of the numbers from0 to n which end with this bit.
note that there can be an exponential number of shortest paths between two nodes - so we cannot report all shortest paths efficiently.
because it is usually very hard to compute the average running time, since we must somehow average over all the instances, we usually strive to analyze the worst case running time.

in practice, the fastest sorting algorithm is quicksort, which uses partitioning as its main idea.
my approach is: realize that linear, finite history, constant coefficient recurrences always can be solvedcheck out any combinatorics or differential equations book for a procedure.
you too can fight the combinatorial explosion!
= prev[x] sentinels boundary conditions can be eliminated using a sentinel element which doesn't go away.
however, it breaks down when we try to use it for2-sat, since there is no way to stuff anything into the chain of clauses.
minimum spanning trees are uneffected by negative cost edges.
fortunately, there is a clever divide-and-conquer algorithm which computes the actual alignment ino(nm) time and o(m) space.
