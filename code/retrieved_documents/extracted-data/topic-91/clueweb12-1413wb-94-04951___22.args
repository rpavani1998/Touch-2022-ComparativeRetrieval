after each of the k classifiers has voted, the class with the highest number of votes is selected as the prediction of the ensemble.
the kth learned classifier attempts to predict bitk of these codewords (a prediction of −1 is treated as a binary value of 0).
this relabeled data is then given to the learning algorithm, which constructs a classifierhk.
the ensemble’s prediction is the classj whose codewordcj is closest (measured by the number of bits that agree) to the k-bit output string.
the best experimental results have been obtained with very large decision trees and neural networks.
the input data can then be relabeled so that any of the original classes in setak are given the derived label −1 and the original classes in setbk are given the derived label +1.
recent experiments suggest that breiman’s combination of bagging and the random subspace method is the method of choice for decision trees: it gives excellent accuracy and works well even when there is substantial noise in the training data.
this work shows that the error of an ensemble on new data points is bounded by the fraction of training data points for which the margin is less than some quantity θ > 0 plus a term that grows as ignoring constant factors and some log terms.
each new hypothesis is constructed by a learning algorithm that seeks to minimize the classification error on aweighted training data set.

adaboost is probably the best method to apply, but favorable results have been obtained just by training several networks from different random starting weight values, and bagging is also quite effective.
freund and schapire (1996) showed improved performance on 22 benchmark problems, equal performance on one problem, and worse performance on four problems.
the input feature subsets were selected (by hand) to group together features that were basedon different image processing operations (such as principal component analysis and the fast fourier transform).
the primary exception are data sets in which there is a high level of mislabeled training data points.
in addition, the base learning algorithm must be sensitive to the encoding of the output values.

in such cases, adaboost will put very high weights on the noisy data points and learn very poor classifiers.
breiman (2001) combines bagging with the random subspace method to grow random decision forests that give excellent performance.
however, because the output coding can create difficult two-class learning problems, it is important that the base learner be very expressive.
experimentally, adaboost has been shown to be very effective at increasing the margins on the training data points; this result suggests that adaboost will make few errors on new data points.
intuitively, this formula says that if the ensemble learning algorithm can achieve a large “margin of safety” on each training data point while using only a weighted sum of simple classifiers,then the resulting voted classifier is likely to be very accurate.
hence, ensemble methods can reduce both the bias and the variance of learning algorithms.
in most experimental studies ( freund and schapire, 1996 ; bauer and kohavi, 1999; dietterich, 2000 ), adaboost (and algorithms based on it) gives the best performance on the vast majority of data sets.

experimental evidence has shown that ensemble methods are often much more accurate than any single hypothesis.
the first approach is to construct each hypothesis independently in such a way that the resulting set of hypotheses is accurate and diverse, that is, each individual hypothesis has a reasonably low error rate for making new predictions and yet the hypotheses disagree with each other in many of their predictions.
the goal of the learning algorithm is to find a good approximationh to f that can be applied to assign labels to newx values.

if not, the feature x3 is tested to see if it is the letter n. k is pronounced only if x2 is not c and x3 is notn.
if the learning algorithm isunstable—that is, if small changes in the training data lead to large changes in the resulting hypothesis— then bagging will produce a diverse ensemble of hypotheses.
in all cases, these algorithms find one best hypothesis h and output it as the “solution” to the learning problem.
a fourth way of generating accurate and diverse ensembles is to inject randomness into the learning algorithm.
in addition, because the internal nodes of the tree test only a single variable, this creates axis-parallel rectangular decision regions that can have high bias.
this creates a resampled data set in which some data points appear multiple times and other data points do not appear at all.
rather than finding one best hypothesis to explain the data, they construct aset of hypotheses (sometimes called acommittee or ensemble) and then have those hypotheses “vote” in some fashion to predict the label of new data points.

for example, the backpropagation algorithm can be run many times, starting each time from a different random setting of the weights.
one way to force a learning algorithm to construct multiple hypotheses is to run the algorithm several times and provide it with somewhat different training data in each run.
because the generalization ability of a single feedforward neural network is usually very good, neural networks benefit less from ensemble methods.
if such an ensemble of hypotheses can be constructed, it is easy to see that it will be more accurate than any of its component classifiers, because the disagreements will cancel out.
