the training of the classifier by means of a pointing device (mouse or tablet pen) is fully interactive in the sense that a real-time display of the current predictions allows the user to iteratively provide more labels and hence improve the classifier performance.once the classifier has been trained on a representative subset of the data, predictions on a very large dataset can be performed off-line in batch-processing mode.rather than devise decision rules by hand, we use statistical learning from a labeled training set to infer robust classification rules.our contribution proposes an automated approach of this type and shows, through quantitative evaluation on a set of 111 synapses, that state-of-the-art machine learning methods can now achieve detection rates comparable to those of humans for asymmetric synapses in fib/sem data.as for any machine learning-based algorithm, the performance of ilastik depends significantly on how well the training dataset represents the true variability of the test data.a meaningful measure of success is how well the automated predictions on a separate test set agree with those of the human.even though our approach does not explicitly implement the morphological criteria listed above, it finds enough evidence in the geometric features, extracted from a local neighborhood of each voxel, to mimic the decisions of the human expert.rather than explicitly implementing the currently used criteria, machine learning allows to imitate the overall decisions of a human.adding more labels did not improve the classification performance, as long as the already labeled set represented the data well, which can be judged, for example, by looking at the current algorithm predictions for some non-labeled synapses (fig. 1, bottom row).analysis of synapse size, shape and distribution contributes essential information to the understanding of neural circuitry, its function and its plasticity.in the interactive mode, it allows the user to immediately see the effect of newly added labels on the classifier's predictions, and therefore reduces the necessary labeling time.the resulting set of 111 synapses formed the gold standard and was used to estimate the error rates of both the original human annotations and the results obtained by the algorithm.we expect the proposed tool to be useful not only for synapse counting, synapse density estimation or estimation of synapse-to-neuron ratio, but also for the ongoing efforts in the reconstruction of neural circuits[8], [9], [26] â€“[29].ilastik ( www.ilastik.org) is a freely available interactive learning and segmentation toolkit, which relies on a rich family of generic (nonlinear) image features and a robust nonlinear classifier[25] to estimate the probability of belonging to a synapse for each individual voxel.uncertain detections are then filtered out by considering only those clusters of voxels with synapse probability greater than a given threshold and with size of at least 1000 voxels.
