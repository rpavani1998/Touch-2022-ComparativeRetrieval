data mining is about building models that give us insights into the world and how the world works.as we learn more about the new complex idea we change our model to better reflect the idea, until eventually we have a model that matches the idea enough for us to make good effect of our understanding of the idea.once we have some basic models we can start to get ideas about more complex models, building on what has come before.in human language we are generally very well skilled at choosing sentences from this infinite number of possibilities to best represent what we would like to communicate.in essence, the model builders differ in how they represent the models they build (i.e., the discovered knowledge) and how they find (or search for) the best model within this representation.but even more than that, our models are often useful to give us guidance in how to deal with and interact with the real world!we can think of the discovered knowledge, or the model, as being expressed as sentences in a language.in understanding new complex ideas we often begin by trying to map the idea into concepts or constructs that we already know, by bringing those constructs together in different ways that reflect how we understand the new complex idea.the skill is to express within the language chosen the best sentences that capture what it is we are attempting to model.we are familiar with the fact that we express ourselves using sentences in our own specific human languages (whether that be english, french, or chinese, for example).in this section we present a framework within which we cast the task of data mining--the task being model building.indeed, writing a computer program is essentially about building a model.formatted output automatically generate filenames reading a large file manipulating data manipulating data as sql using sqlite odbc data database connection excel access clipboard data spatial data simple mapclustered box plot further resources map displays further resources preparing data data selection and extraction training and test datasets data cleaning review data selectively changing vector values replace indices by names missing values remove levels from a factor variable manipulations remove columns reorder columns remove non-numeric columns remove variables with no variance cleaning the wine dataset cleaning the cardiac dataset cleaning the survey dataset imputation nearest neighboursreverse a list sorting unique values loading data interactive responses interactive data entry available datasets
