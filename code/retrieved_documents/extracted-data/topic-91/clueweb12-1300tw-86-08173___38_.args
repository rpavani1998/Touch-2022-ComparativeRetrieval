from the knowledge discovery perspective, the ability to track and evaluate every step in the decision-making process is one of the most important factors for trusting the decisions gained from data-mining methods.although current state-of-the art classifiers (e.g. support vector machines[11]) or ensembles of classifiers (e.g. random forest [12] or rotation forest[13]) significantly outperform classical decision tree classification models in terms of classification accuracy or other classification performance metrics, they are not suitable for knowledge discovery process.due to their popularity, decision trees have been applied to different research fields including bioinformatics[5], [6] , medicine[7] and image classification [8].in such cases the complexity of decision trees, which is usually measured as the number of nodes or the number of rules that can be extracted from a tree, is of high importance and can influence the evaluation of the discovered knowledge by domain experts[14].through application of decision trees to different fields of research and their use in open source and commercial software for machine learning and data mining, it has been demonstrated that end-users still prefer node-link diagrams although their space covering is not optimal.the empirical results demonstrate that by building simple models constrained by predefined visual boundaries, one not only achieves good comprehensibility, but also very good classification performance that does not differ from usually more complex models built using default settings of the classical decision tree algorithm.one of the main reasons for this is decision trees' ability to represent the results in a simple decision tree format which is easy to interpret for experts, as they can see the structure of decisions in the classifying process.in addition to their simplicity, building decision trees is often a less time consuming classification process compared to other classification techniques[2], and decision tree rules can be directly used as statements in a database access language (e.g. sql).examples of such techniques are decision trees that possess an important advantage in comparison with competitive classification methods - i.e., the symbolic representation of the extracted knowledge.although we did not expected significant differences in classification performance, the results demonstrate a significant increase of accuracy in less complex visually tuned decision trees.this method helps data analysts in building effective decision tree representations with spending less time on setting and tuning the parameters of decision tree induction algorithm when compared to classical methods.from the analyst's perspective it is very important that the produced representation of the decision tree allows effective communication with end-users (i.e. customers) or domain experts in cases of decision tree applications in research.as already mentioned, one should be cautious when interpreting the results above, since accuracy is not a well suited performance measure in cases of unbalanced multi-class datasets.in addition, our study demonstrates the suitability of visually tuned decision trees for datasets with binary class attributes and a high number of possibly redundant attributes that are very common in bioinformatics.by tuning the parameters, without interfering with the internal decision tree building process and constraining the tuning only by the dimensions of the decision tree, the bias of influencing the classification performance is avoided.
