it is therefore the preferred method for evaluating the statistical significance of parameter estimates in stepwise or best-subset model building methods.sensitivity analysis can give important insights into the usefulness of individual variables.a model-building technique that finds subsets of predictor variables that most adequately predict responses on a dependent variable by linear (or nonlinear) regression, given the specified criteria for adequacy of model fit.survival analysis (exploratory and hypothesis testing) techniques include descriptive methods for estimating the distribution of survival times from a sample, methods for comparing survival in two or more groups, and techniques for fitting linear or non-linear regression models to survival data.sensitivity analysis rates variables according to the deterioration in modeling performance that occurs if that variable is no longer available to the model.these methods are called supervised learning algorithms because the learning (fitting of models) is "guided" or "supervised" by the observed classifications recorded in the data file.with statistica variance estimation and precision, you can obtain estimates of variance components and use them to make precision statements while at the same time comparing fixed effects in the presence of multiple sources of variation.this type of task calls for an unsupervised learning algorithm, because learning (fitting of models) in this case cannot be guided by previously known classifications.so, for example, the predicted classifications from the tree classifiers, linear model, and the neural network classifier(s) can be used as input variables into a neural network meta-classifier, which will attempt to "learn" from the data how to combine the predictions from the different models to yield maximum classification accuracy.instead of discarding such observations from the data analysis all together (i.e., unnecessarily loose potentially useful information) survival analysis techniques can accommodate censored observations, and "use" them in statistical significance testing and model fitting.given that we have effectively removed some information that presumably the network uses (i.e. one of its input variables), we would reasonably expect some deterioration in error to occur.statistica process optimization integrates all quality control charts, process capability analyses, experimental design procedures, and six sigma methods with a comprehensive library of cutting-edge techniques for exploratory and predictive data mining.a suppressor variable (in multiple regression ) has zero (or close to zero) correlation with the criterion but is correlated with one or more of the predictor variables, and therefore, it will suppress irrelevant variance of independent variables.if height is a suppressor variable, then it will suppress, or control for, irrelevant variance (i.e., variance that is shared with the predictor and not the criterion), thus increasing the partial correlation.finally,survival analysis includes the use of regression models for estimating the relationship of (multiple) continuous variables to survival times.
