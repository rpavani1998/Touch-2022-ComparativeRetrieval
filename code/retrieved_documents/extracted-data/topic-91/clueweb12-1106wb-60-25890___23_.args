scholars have learned that ecosystems are diverse, complex, and uncertain, and sustainable management requires substantial investment in acquiring accurate data to learn more about patterns of interaction and adapt policies over time that are better fitted to particular systems.their second major finding was that while these changes have led to substantial net gains in economic development and human well-being, the gains have been achieved at growing costs in the form of the degradation of many ecosystem services, increased risks of nonlinear changes, and the exacerbation of poverty for some groups of people.we can, however, recognize our growing capabilities and those of the individuals we study to experiment with rules, learn from the experiments, and, if the broader institutional and cultural milieu facilitates, gradually improve outcomes so they are sustainable over time.new technologies, including remote sensing and gis, provide more accurate information to localities that can be used for better decisionmaking.setting up strict hierarchical systems may increase the speed of decisions but ignore the interests of some participants who eventually erupt and potentially destroy an operational system.this generates a measure of forest condition that is comparable across different ecological regions.forest systems are associated with the regulation of 57% of total water runoff.building respectful collaborations between local users, public officials, and scientific experts is a vital requisite of adaptive governance.governance systems that ignore the possibility of conflict over diverse issues may increase the likelihood of these conflicts, which could eventually erupt into major problems.comparing forest measures such as the average diameter at breast height or basal area across ecological zones is misleading since these measures are strongly affected by precipitation, soils, elevation, and other factors that dramatically vary across zones.proponents stress that pes policies are strongly related to sustainable development since payments could be allocated to poorer residents of tropical forests who have a financial, as well as a lifestyle, motivation to protect forests.in fact, findings from multiple studies of government- or community-managed forests illustrate the crucial role monitoring played in impacting the cohesiveness of institutions, as well as the success of diverse forest management initiatives.50 when harvesting rules are effectively monitored and enforced, they prevent the spread of freeriding behavior, thereby instilling a sense of trust in the community.by comparison, itq systems that lack an effective monitoring system have suffered from considerable underreporting of catch levels.the challenge is combining accurate scientific understanding of coupled human-environmental systems and expected changes in these variables over time with information available to the users about their own future and the changes they can make in governance as well as use.about 4.6 billion people depend for all or some of their water on supplies from forest systems.
