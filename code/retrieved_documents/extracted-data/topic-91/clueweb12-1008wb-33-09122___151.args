we get 0.9546, i.e., we are in the prediction interval in (more than) 5% of the cases -- but the prediction interval is huge: it tells us that we cannot predict much.
those points will "touch" the thick hyperplane, they will limit its thickness -- actually, you can even forget the other points 2.
first, we remark that the error rate is optimistic (26% instead of 33% -- and the oob bootstrap is supposed to be pessimistic...).

combining regressions (bma,...) tests and confidence intervals after this bird's eye view of several regression techniques, let us come back to linear regression.
often, you can solve the problem by transforming the variables (so that the outliers and influential observations disappear, so that the residuals look normal, so that the residuals have the same variance -- quite often, you can do all this at the same time), by altering the model (for a simpler or more complex one) or by using another regression (gls to account for heteroskedasticity and correlated residuals, robust regression to account for remaining influencial observations).
if you end with a temperature # equal to zero, you get a single solution, as with the # steepest descent, but you are less likely to be stuck in # a local minimum (this is called simulated annealing); if # you decrease the temperature until 1, you get another # mcmc, with a different burn-up period.
bagging (bootstrap aggregation) one idea, to increase the quality on an estimator (a non-linear and unstable one, e.g., a regression tree) is simply to compute its "mean" on several bootstrap samples.
even from a statistical point of view, they look different.
i wanted to prove, here, on an example, that non gaussian residuals produces confidence intervals too small and thus incorrect results.
[1] 19 in short, to have the most incorrect prediction intervals, take large values of x, bit not too large (close to 0, the predictions are correct, away from 0, the prediction intervals are huge).
the vc dimension of the classification algorithm f is the largest number of points shattered by f.
too many variables todo explain what you can do if there are more variables than observations.
some points might bear an abnormally high influence on the regression results.
in r, this method is available in the "superpc" package and can accomodate classical or survival regression.
i was wrong: the confidence intervals are correct but very large, to the point that the forecasts are useless.
if you use algorithms that do not use coordinates but just scalar products, this trick (the "kernel trick") allows you to increase the dimension without having to compute the actual coordinates.
that f(.,a) makes no mistakes on the training set.
we get 0.9546, i.e., we are in the prediction interval in (more than) 5% of the cases -- but the prediction interval is huge: it tells us that we cannot predict much.
we also get the confusion matrix, that gives the "distances" between the classes: we can use it to plot the classes in the plane, with a distance analysis algorithm (mds (multidimensional scaling), etc. -- we have already mentionned this).
you can also measure the effect of each observation on the regression: remove the point, compute the regression, the predicted values and compare them with the values predicted from the whole sample: plot(dffits(r),type='h',lwd=3) you can also compare the coefficients: plot(dfbetas(r)[,1],type='h',lwd=3) plot(dfbetas(r)[,2],type='h',lwd=3)
you can try with moving window to find the most probable date for the structural change (you can take a window with a constant width, or one with a constrant number of observations).

# the second version also accepts models that are slightly # worse, with a certain probability (high if the model is # only slightly worse, low if it is really worse).
if you know where the change occurs, you just split your sample into several chuks and perform a regression on each (to make sure that a change occured, you can test the equality of the coefficients in the chunks).

these quantities are important when you compare models with a different number of parameters: the log-likelihood will always increase if you add more variables, falling in the "overfit" trap.
regression problems -- and their solutions tests and confidence intervals partial residual plots, added variable plots some plots to explore a regression overfit the curse of dimension wide problems in this chapter, we list some of the problems that may occur in a regression and explain how to spot them -- graphically.
in some cases, you can even get contradictory results: depending on the order of the predictive variables, you can find that z sometimes depends on x, sometimes not.
# you can also change the "temperature", i.e., the # probability that a worse model will be accepted, when # the algorithm proceeds.
if the sample is too small, you will not be able to estimate much, in such situationm you have to restrict yourself to simple (simplistic) models, such as linear models, becaus the overfitting risk is too high.
the "summary" function gave us the results of a student t test on the regression coefficients -- that answered the question "is this coefficient significantly different from zero?".
important variables may be missing, that can change the results of the regression and their interpretation.

well, the actual algorithm is slightly more complicated: one does not directly us the correlation to select the variables.

remark: the structure of the estimator is lost -- if it was a tree, you get a bunch of trees (a forest), whose predictions are more reliable, but which is harder to interpret.
