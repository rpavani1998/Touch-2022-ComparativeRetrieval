furthermore it is easily extensible and allows to automate benchmarking of different agents.the aim is to provide reusable components that can be quickly applied to machine learning problems.it bundles tools for data retrieval, text analysis, clustering and classification, and data visualization.it provides high-level abstraction of typical processing steps (e.g. data preparation, classification, feature selection, [...]this makes it easy to parallelise things such as n-fold cross validation (each fold runs on its own processor) or multiple kmeans random starts.it does not provide any ml algorithms, has no gui, and it is restricted to experiments that fulfill a certain uniformity.this is targeted at a research and rapid prototyping audience.the scikit-learn aims to provide state of the art standard machine learning algorithms in python.moreover, the default splitter of crossvalidation is more robust in terms of number and type of created splits for common usage patterns (i.e. together with partitioners).this is significantly more efficient for big constant arrays.faulty drivers results in in wrong results for reduce operations.it should reduce run-time impact of debug() calls in regular, non -o mode of python operation., gpualloc are not always pre-computed (constant_folding optimization) at compile time if all their inputs are constant.the default behavior, stacking as multiple samples, is unchanged.deep learning tutorials illustrate deep learning with theano.
