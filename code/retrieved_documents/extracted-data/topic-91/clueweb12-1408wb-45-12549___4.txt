it all depends on how well the model builder  works on your data, and, in fact, how you measure the performance on the model.

the key conclusion, they found, was that boosted trees and random forests generally perform the best, and that decision trees, logistic regression and boosted stumps generally perform the worst.
the tricky bits are tuning the model builders (requiring an understanding of the sometimes very many and very complex model builder parameters) and selecting the right criteria to assess the performance of the model (a criteria to match the task at hand--noting that raw accuracy is not always, and maybe not often, the right criteria).

for example, if the  task is one of information retrieval then a precision/recall measure may be  best.
an overall conclusion from such comparative studies, then, is that often it is best to deploy different model builders over the dataset to investigate which performs the best.
that is a question that has challenged us for a long time, and still there remains no definitive answer.
so, in conclusion, it is good to build multiple models using multiple  model builders.
