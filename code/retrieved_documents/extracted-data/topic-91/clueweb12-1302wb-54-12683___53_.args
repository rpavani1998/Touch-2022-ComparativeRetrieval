this method constructs a decision tree based classifier that maintains highest accuracy on training data and improves on generalization accuracy as it grows in complexity.this metaclassifier makes its base classifier cost-sensitive.- conditional box plot - a box plot displays robust statistical parameters for numerical attributes and identifies extreme outliers.ordinalclassclassifier - meta classifier that allows standard classification algorithms to be applied to ordinal class problems.this node uses a svm model generated by the svm learner node to predict the output for given parameters.the conditional box plot partitions the data of one column into classes and creates a box plot for each of them.feature list filter - this filter either bypasses or filters the network elements (nodes/edges) which features match the values of the given data table.weka predictor - the weka predictor takes a model generated in a weka node and classifies the test data at the inport.this class implements a single conjunctive rule learner that can predict for numeric and nominal class labels.- feature list filter - this filter either bypasses or filters the network elements (nodes/edges) which features match the values of the given data table.metacost - this metaclassifier makes its base classifier cost-sensitive.- weka predictor - the weka predictor takes a model generated in a weka node and classifies the test data at the inport.rules conjunctiverule - this class implements a single conjunctive rule learner that can predict for numeric and nominal class labels.predictors weka cluster assigner - the weka cluster assigner takes a cluster model generated in a weka node and assigns the data at the inport to the corresponding clusters.- feature value filter - this filter either bypasses or filters the network elements (nodes/edges) that match the given filter value.
