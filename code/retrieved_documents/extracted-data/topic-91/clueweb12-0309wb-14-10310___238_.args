thus, a process for gene selection and error estimation is made practical, ensuring control of the selection bias, and providing additional diagnostic indicators of gene importance.owing to the amount and complexity of the generated experimental data, machine learning techniques provide a promising approach to investigate novel patterns in high-dimensional metabolic data which form the source for constructing classification rules with high discriminatory power.their ability to work in high dimension, to process non-vectorial data, and the natural framework they provide to integrate heterogeneous data are particularly relevant to various problems arising in computational biology.it has been shown to produce lower prediction error compared to classifiers based on other methods like artificial neural networks, especially when large numbers of features are considered for sample description.as high-throughput technology for snps improves and as more snps are identified, it is likely that much higher predictive accuracy will be achieved and a useful clinical tool developed.we show experimentally that the new method results in a superior performance across a wide range of organisms and that it improves even upon our own earlier method by an average of 10% across all examined genomes.thus, robust methods for fast feature selection are of key importance in extracting knowledge from complex biological data.these findings indicate that incorporating structural information is critical to achieving good prediction accuracy when sufficient evolutionary information is not available.the binary kernel discrimination approach yielded consistently superior rankings and would appear to have considerable potential for chemical screening applications.data mining research suggests that the use of frequent patterns has good performance in aiding the development of accurate and efficient classification algorithms.this new approach provides superior prediction performance compared with existing algorithms based on amino acid composition and can be a complementary method to other existing methods based on sorting signals.our data indicate that supervised learning classification techniques can predict outcome in dlbcl and identify rational targets for intervention.svms show better generalization performance, but decision trees have the advantage of generating interpretable rules with robust estimates of prediction confidence.experimental comparisons using kernel classifiers demonstrate both parsimonious feature selection and excellent classification accuracy on a range of synthetic and benchmark data sets.taken together, these results demonstrate the feasibility of accurate, multiclass molecular cancer classification and suggest a strategy for future clinical implementation of molecular cancer diagnostics.
