in order to explore the airs sensitivity to these parameters, leave-20%-out (five-fold) cross-validation predictions were performed over a wide range of values for the airs parameters.
the chemical structure was encoded with 159 structural descriptors from five classes, namely constitutional, topological indices, electrotopological state indices, quantum descriptors, and geometrical indices.
abstract: artificial immune systems (ais) are machine learning  procedures inspired by the structure and function of the biological immune  system.
the learning task was to classify a dataset of 196 drugs into a subset of 131 that penetrate the human intestine and a subset of 65 drugs that do not penetrate the intestine.
in this paper we present the first application of the artificial immune recognition system (airs) to the modeling of the human intestinal absorption (hia) of drugs.
the best predictions of  the airs algorithm (selectivity 0.794, specificity 0.615, accuracy 0.735, and  matthews correlation coefficient 0.406) surpass those obtained with several  well-established machine learning methods.
october 2006, volume 5, number 10, 515-529 artificial immune system prediction of the human intestinal absorption  of drugs with airs (artificial immune recognition system)
in a comparison with 13 machine  learning algorithms, airs predictions were better in seven cases (bayesian  network, naïve bayes classifier, updateable naïve bayes classifier,  logistic regression, gaussian radial basis function network, decision tree with  naïve bayes classifiers at the leaves, and random tree), and worse in six  cases (k* instance-based classifier, alternating decision tree, c4.5 decision  tree, logistic model trees, random forest, and fast decision tree learner).
the affinity  threshold scalar has the highest influence on the prediction quality, whereas  the remaining parameters have only a marginal effect.

the results obtained suggest that classifiers based on artificial immune systems may be successful in structure-activity relationships (sar), quantitative structure-activity relationships (qsar), drug design, and virtual screening of chemical libraries.

eight user defined parameters influences the classification  performance of the airs algorithm, namely affinity threshold scalar, clonal  rate, hypermutation rate, number of nearest neighbors, initial memory cell pool  size, number of instances to compute the affinity threshold, stimulation  threshold, and total resources.
