subsampling with shrinkage can further increase the accuracy of the model.
the former is the number of trees in the forest.
empirical evidence suggests that small values oflearn_rate favor better test error.[htf2009] recommend to set the learning rate to a small constant (e.g. learn_rate <= 0.1) and choose n_estimators by early stopping.
the number of weak learners (i.e. regression trees) is controlled by the parametern_estimators; the maximum depth of each tree is controlled via max_depth.
note that because of inter-process communication overhead, the speedup might not be linear (i.e., usingk jobs will unfortunately not be k times as fast).
at each iterationn_classes regression trees have to be constructed which makes gbrt rather inefficient for data sets with a large number of classes.
when training on large datasets, where runtime and memory requirements are important, it might also be beneficial to adjust themin_density parameter, that controls a heuristic for speeding up computations in each tree.
this usually allows to reduce the variance of the model a bit more, at the expense of a slightly greater increase in bias: >>> from sklearn.cross_validation import cross_val_score >>>from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs >>> from sklearn.ensemble import randomforestclassifier >>> from sklearn.ensemble import extratreesclassifier >>> from sklearn.tree import decisiontreeclassifier >>> x, y = make_blobs(n_samples=10000, n_features=10, centers=100, ... random_state=0) >>> clf =
subsampling without shrinkage, on the other hand, does poorly.
in contrast to the original publication [b2001], the scikit-learn implementation combines classifiers by averaging their probabilistic prediction, instead of letting each classifier vote for a single class.
as a result of this randomness, the bias of the forest usually slightly increases (with respect to the bias of a single non-random tree) but, due to averaging, its variance also decreases, usually more than compensating for the increase in bias, hence yielding an overall better model.
the plot on the right shows the feature importances which can be optained via thefeature_importance property.
smaller values oflearn_rate require larger numbers of weak learners to maintain a constant training error.
plots like these are often used for early stopping.
parallelization¶ finally, this module also features the parallel construction of the trees and the parallel computation of the predictions through then_jobs parameter.
the following example shows how to fit a gradient boosting classifier with 100 decision stumps as weak learners: >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_hastie_10_2 >>> from sklearn.ensemble import gradientboostingclassifier >>> x, y = make_hastie_10_2(random_state=0) >>> x_train, x_test = x[:2000], x[2000 :] >>> y_train, y_test = y[:2000], y[2000:] >>> clf = gradientboostingclassifier(n_estimators=100, learn_rate=1.0, ... max_depth=1, random_state=0).fit(x_train, y_train) >>> clf.score(x_test, y_test) 0.913...
the natural choice for regression due to its superior computational properties.

the figure below shows the results of applying gradientboostingregressor with least squares loss and 500 base learners to the boston house-price dataset (seesklearn.datasets.load_boston).
in addition, when splitting a node during the construction of the tree, the split that is chosen is no longer the best split among all features.
note that because of inter-process communication overhead, the speedup might not be linear (i.e., usingk jobs will unfortunately not be k times as fast).

at each iteration the base classifier is trained on a fractionsubsample of the available training data.
the disadvantages of gbrt are: - scalability, due to the sequential nature of boosting it can hardly be parallelized.
as other classifiers, forest classifiers have to be fitted with two arrays: an array x of size[n_samples, n_features] holding the training samples, and an array y of size[n_samples] holding the target values (class labels) for the training samples: >>> from sklearn.ensemble import randomforestclassifier >>>x =
gradient tree boosting uses decision trees of fixed size as weak learners.
if n_jobs=k then computations are partitioned into k jobs, and run on k cores of the machine.
if n_jobs=k then computations are partitioned into k jobs, and run on k cores of the machine.
the plot on the left shows the train and test error at each iteration.
subsampling with shrinkage can further increase the accuracy of the model.
classification¶ gradientboostingclassifier supports both binary and multi-class classification via the deviance loss function (loss='deviance').
we can clearly see that shrinkage outperforms no-shrinkage.
in random forests (see randomforestclassifier and randomforestregressor classes), each tree in the ensemble is built from a sample drawn with replacement (i.e., a bootstrap sample) from the training set.
ifn_jobs=-1 then all cores available on the machine are used.
the advantages of gbrt are: natural handling of data of mixed type (= heterogeneous features) predictive power robustness to outliers in input space (via robust loss functions)

the number of weak learners (i.e. regression trees) is controlled by the parametern_estimators; the maximum depth of each tree is controlled via max_depth.
decision trees have a number of abilities that make them valuable for boosting, namely the ability to handle data of mixed type and the ability to model complex functions.
significant speedup can still be achieved though when building a large number of trees, or when building a single tree requires a fair amount of time (e.g., on large datasets).
the module sklearn.ensemble provides methods for both classification and regression via gradient boosted regression trees.

by contrast, in boosting methods, models are built sequentially and one tries to reduce the bias of the combined model.
in addition, note that bootstrap samples are used by default in random forests ( bootstrap=true) while the default strategy is to use the original dataset for building extra-trees (bootstrap=false).

empiricial good default values are max_features=n_features for regression problems, and max_features=sqrt(n_features) for classification tasks (where n_features is the number of features in the data).
