the results obtained suggest that classifiers based on artificial immune systems may be successful in structure-activity relationships (sar), quantitative structure-activity relationships (qsar), drug design, and virtual screening of chemical libraries.the affinity threshold scalar has the highest influence on the prediction quality, whereas the remaining parameters have only a marginal effect.the best predictions of the airs algorithm (selectivity 0.794, specificity 0.615, accuracy 0.735, and matthews correlation coefficient 0.406) surpass those obtained with several well-established machine learning methods.in a comparison with 13 machine learning algorithms, airs predictions were better in seven cases (bayesian network, naïve bayes classifier, updateable naïve bayes classifier, logistic regression, gaussian radial basis function network, decision tree with naïve bayes classifiers at the leaves, and random tree), and worse in six cases (k* instance-based classifier, alternating decision tree, c4.5 decision tree, logistic model trees, random forest, and fast decision tree learner).eight user defined parameters influences the classification performance of the airs algorithm, namely affinity threshold scalar, clonal rate, hypermutation rate, number of nearest neighbors, initial memory cell pool size, number of instances to compute the affinity threshold, stimulation threshold, and total resources.the learning task was to classify a dataset of 196 drugs into a subset of 131 that penetrate the human intestine and a subset of 65 drugs that do not penetrate the intestine.in this paper we present the first application of the artificial immune recognition system (airs) to the modeling of the human intestinal absorption (hia) of drugs.abstract: artificial immune systems (ais) are machine learning procedures inspired by the structure and function of the biological immune system.2006, 5, 515-529 abstract: artificial immune systems (ais) are machine learning procedures inspired by the structure and function of the biological immune system.the chemical structure was encoded with 159 structural descriptors from five classes, namely constitutional, topological indices, electrotopological state indices, quantum descriptors, and geometrical indices.free: download the paper in pdf format return to table of contents get acrobat reader to view and print the paper home | news | current issue | journal index | iecmd 2004 | preprint index | instructions for authors | send the manuscript | special issue last changes: january 5, 2006 webmaster http://www.biochempress.com/internet electronic journal of molecular design - iejmd, issn 1538-6414, coden iejmat artificial immune system prediction of the human intestinal absorption of drugs with airs (artificial immune recognition system) ovidiu ivanciuc internet electron.
