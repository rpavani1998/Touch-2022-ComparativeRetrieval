february 12, 2011, 23:53:03 cleaned up and tested code.
fixed a tricky bug in sda and a few minor issues elsewhere speed improvements.
for unsupervised learning, milk supports k-means clustering and affinity propagation.
changes to previous version: added a new module: milk.ext.jugparallel to interface with jug  (http://luispedro.org/software/jug).
add some new functions: measures.curves.precision_recall,  milk.unsupervised.kmeans.select_best.kmeans.

its focus is on supervised classification with several classifiers  available: svms (based on libsvm), k-nn, random forests, decision trees.
these classifiers can be combined in many ways  to form different classification systems.
added folds argument to nfoldcrossvalidation.
it  also performs feature selection.

it works over many datatypes, with a  preference for numpy arrays.

this makes it easy to parallelise things such as n-fold cross validation (each fold runs on its own processor) or multiple kmeans random starts.
removed files from the distribution that were mistakenly included.
added folds argument to  nfoldcrossvalidation.
better documentation.

changed the classification interface to separate model learning from model usage.
perhaps you'd like to be the first?
