because of their remarkable -- their life-essential task -- of converting carbon dioxide into organic compounds such as sugar and then releasing oxygen (their waste, our gain), trees have the unusual ability to cleanse the air we breathe.

"then the ground dried out and there just wasn't enough moisture after we planted." the forest service has gone back to the drawing board, shrinking the number of acres to be planted and, where possible, switching to tree species that are indigenous to the san gabriel mountains.
to restrain it, the research team sprayed the grass-planted watersheds with  herbicides, a strategy that comes with two ironies.
the scientists did not fully accept the evidence their research revealed;  instead, they insisted that under ideal conditions -- ample rain, significant  labor, and chemical applications -- "land managers appear justified in  trying to establish a grass crop."

early in the 20th-century, they collaborated with county efforts to plant seedlings in this rough terrain, with predictable results: "in the 1920s, a million trees including exotic canary island pines were planted in the san gabriel mountains in a misguided effort to fix something that was not a problem -- a predominance of native chaparral," asserted rick halsey.
