this is a highly promising result, indicating that such parameter estimation techniques make crfs a practical and efficient choice for labelling sequential data, as well as a theoretically sound and principled probabilistic framework.automated feature induction enables not only improved accuracy and dramatic reduction in parameter count, but also the use of larger cliques, and more freedom to liberally hypothesize atomic input variables that may be relevant to a task.linear-chain conditional random fields (crfs) have been shown to perform well for information extraction and other language modelling tasks due to their ability to capture arbitrary, overlapping features of the input in a markov model.in contrast, conditional models like the crfs seamlessly represent contextual dependencies, support efficient, exact inference using dynamic programming, and their parameters can be trained using convex optimization.conditional random fields offer several advantages over hidden markov models and stochastic grammars for such tasks, including the ability to relax strong independence assumptions made in those models.state-of-the-art methods have achieved low error rates but invariably make a number of errors.as a result, gradient tree boosting scales linearly in the order of the markov model and in the order of the feature interactions, rather than exponentially like previous algorithms based on iterative scaling and gradient descent.the ability to find tables and extract information from them is a necessary component of data mining, question answering, and other information retrieval tasks.conditional random fields (crfs; lafferty, mccallum, & pereira, 2001) provide a flexible and powerful model for learning to assign labels to elements of sequences in such applications as part-of-speech tagging, text-to-speech mapping, protein and dna sequence analysis, and information extraction from web pages.improved training methods based on modern optimization algorithms were critical in achieving these results.conversely, probabilistic graphical models, such as markov networks, can represent correlations between labels, by exploiting problem structure, but cannot handle high-dimensional feature spaces, and lack strong theoretical generalization guarantees.with only five days development time and little knowledge of this language, we automatically discover relevant features by providing a large array of lexical tests and using feature induction to automatically construct the features that most increase conditional likelihood.experimental results from a genomics domain show that our models are more accurate at locating instances of overlapping patterns than are baseline models based on hmms.the connections between individual pixels are not very informative, but by using dense graphs, we can pool information from large regions of the image; dense models also support efficient inference.this can be particularly important for gene finding, where including evidence from protein databases, est data, or tiling arrays may improve accuracy.
