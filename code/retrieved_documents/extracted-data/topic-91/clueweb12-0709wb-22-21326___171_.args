results are promising since with very limited computation and low sensitivity to the quality of prior knowledge, potentially dangerous situations are successfully detected and classified.some nodes may behave maliciously, resulting in degradation of the performance of the network or even disruption of its operation altogether.this necessitates frequent long distance network transfers of data (potentially repeatedly) which results in a high response time for users, and is wasteful of the available network bandwidth.by resorting to automated data acquisition our architecture allows for the evaluation of the predictions made and subsequent action aiming at improving the predictive performance thus enhancing adaptive capacities.agents are considered as advanced tools for resolving complex issues in networking based on intelligent and dynamic features.the proposed hybrid model could function as an effective tool for clinical diagnostics in the future clinical circumstance.previously unknown knowledge can be extracted from that data in order to create prediction and decision models.experimental results demonstrate that the algorithm is robust, and can denoise the noise efficiently while preserving the surface features.as the size of samples grows, the size of generated decision trees grows with some improvement in error rates.thus, the simulation on the computer of the phenomena that take place during road events can be studied more comprehensively, and may allow optimize passive safety systems in order to diminish adverse effects of these phenomena.but selecting proper samples for a given decision tree algorithm is not easy, because each decision tree algorithm has its own property in generating trees and selecting appropriate samples that represent given target data setcompression algorithms allow defining a similarity measure based on the degree of common information, whereas clustering methods allow clustering similar data without any previous knowledge.simulation results show the efficiency of integrating agents within telecommunication networks and also prove that such a dual simulation environment is needed to test new techniques based on agents and multi-agent systems in networking.the main findings of the study were a clear causality between quality of the taught semantic networks in game world and players' knowledge in real life and an evidence that learning away is an important feature when trying to enable conceptual change in educational games.but selecting proper samples for a given decision tree algorithm is not easy, because each decision tree algorithm has its own property in generating trees and selecting appropriate samples that represent given target data set well is difficult.
