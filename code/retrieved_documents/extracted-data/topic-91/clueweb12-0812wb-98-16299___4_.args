this makes it easy to parallelise things such as n-fold cross validation (each fold runs on its own processor) or multiple kmeans random starts.for unsupervised learning, milk supports k-means clustering and affinity propagation.it works over many datatypes, with a preference for numpy arrays.it also performs feature selection.changed the classification interface to separate model learning from model usage.agnostic data formats: none, agnostic tags: python, svm, feature selection, kmeans, decision tree learning, random forests, supervised, libsvm, affinity propagation, nonnegative matrix factorization archive: download here version changelog date 0.3.10 added a new module: milk.ext.jugparallel to interface with jug (http://luispedro.org/software/jug).better documentation.by luispedro - may 11, 2011, 04:18:53 cet [ ] view (3 today), download ( 0 today ), 1 subscription overalloverall milk is a machine learning toolkit in python.changes to previous version: added a new module: milk.ext.jugparallel to interface with jug (http://luispedro.org/software/jug).added assign_centroids function fix compilation on windows.added a new module: milk.ext.jugparallel to interface with jug (http://luispedro.org/software/jug).removed files from the distribution that were mistakenly included.fixed a tricky bug in sda and a few minor issues elsewhere added a new module: milk.ext.jugparallel to interface with jug (http://luispedro.org/software/jug).fixed a tricky bug in sda and a few minor issues elsewhere speed improvements.may 21, 2010, 22:05:04 improved performance.
