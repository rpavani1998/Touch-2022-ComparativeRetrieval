this adds significant 3d performance such that the laptop is now a viable casual pc gaming platform.while it does drop the blu-ray drive and quad core processor in favor of a dual core, the addition of a dedicated nvidia graphics processor boosts the overall capabilities of what the laptop can be used for.because of this, toshiba has reduced the processor down to an intel core i5-2430m dual core which still offers a fair amount of performance and more than enough for the average user.this includes a 750gb hard drive that is larger than the average 17-inch laptop currently so there is more space for storing applications, data and media files.memory stays the same at 6gb of ddr3 memory that allows for a generally smooth overall experience with the windows 7 operating system.performance from the panel is fairly typical and the standard glossy coating can make it difficult to use outdoors or in certain conditions without a fair amount of glare and reflections.the drive spins at the traditional 5400rpm rate that means it it lacks a bit in performance compared to systems using 7200rpm drives.it would have been nice to see them keep the blu-ray at this price point and drop the number of applications installed that slow down the boot times but overall, toshiba's changes are generally an improvement for consumers looking at a general purpose 17-inch laptop.since the high definition optical format hasn't taken off like dvd did and more people are using digital media files and streaming, this isn't a big loss for some but it is notable as toshiba does market the p series laptops as entertainment focused.users will want to pick and choose what they want to keep and remove.in addition to helping 3d applications, the nvidia graphics offer a broader support foraccelerating non-3d applications such as photoshop compared to the intel quicksync feature.toshiba has installed a large number of branded utilities and software applications onto the system.it still may struggle to have high detail levels especially at higher resolutions but this isn't designed for gaming like theqosmio series is.this is great for those looking to do tasks like desktop video work.in addition to reducing the processor, toshiba has replaced the blu-ray compatible optical drive with a standard dual-layer dvd burner.
