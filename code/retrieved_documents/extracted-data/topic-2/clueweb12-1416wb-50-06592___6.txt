so i think that's enough for comparing these two if you are a developer then laptop will be pretty frustrating to work with.
desktops all the way, double the power, half the price, enough said!
i rarely use my laptop, only if i'm not at home.
it's stronger than laptop and scree is much bigger than on lap top :)

i guess it's partly true because almost  everyone i know uses a laptop instead of a proper desktop pc.
however, many are not aware of the health hazards that using a laptop  presents.
but i still find them more useful for email and internet surfing.
however, laptops are great when i travel (when i pretend i'm doing work, when i'm actually watching a film =p) i do find that when i'm working or watching a film, after a while my back/neck just starts to ache.
in fact it would be wrong to refer to some  of them as "laptops" - a few of my friends have ones with massive  17" screens and weigh over 9 lbs.
now , i 'm using a laptop.
i have had a laptop as my primary machine for about 5 years now.
using them placed on your lap for even  half an hour would fry your private parts and might stop the blood circulation  on your legs as well.
most of  them use it as a desktop pc replacement.
(of course, as head of it, i have 6 computers, both pcs and macs, running windows, os/x and linux - but my laptop is still my main comp).
if i'm working, i prefer to work on a desktop.
i am never going back to a desktop ever again.
the other thing is, you can get a really nice beefed up desktop for very little money.
laptop of course, is ceap, portable, and i love it...
i must be old fashioned because i choose the desktop.
i would say both are equally important as per work.
do you prefer a laptop or a desktop pc?
the small screens (in majority) and tiny closely set keyboards are not  exactly ergonomic either.
i will always prefer desktops because they are so much easier to upgrade and parts are cheaper for them then laptops.
laptop don't have good graphic card.
however, for sheer practicality, i will say i prefer laptops.
but i would definitely buy a desktop for a wider flat screen monitor and for speed .i think both are complimentary and can't outdo much .
it's worked well for me.
if i am working with dreamweaver, photoshop and other programs running, i'll take my loaded desktop thanks.
as you say we use them sitting and lying in awkward positions.
i was using a desktop pc in college .
due to it's portability, a lot of people work with a laptop in  awkward positions - lying on the bed, hunched over it on a park bench and so  on.
and i never leavemy home lately :d i prefer using a laptop, simply bcos of my relatively high mobility, and i'm not a pc gamer.
i cannot play a game that need fast graphic card in my laptop.
it's quite affordable to have a lappie with 3gb or 4gb ram, which translates to a speedy performer.
i have both desktop and laptop.
8 jan 2009 laptops vs desktop pcs a recent reuters' article asks: " is  it the end of the desktop pc?".
right now i have my eye on thedell inspiron mini 9.
both desktop and laptop have different function.
personally i prefer my my extremely fast desktop  pc, with the ergonomic microsoft keyboard and wide 22" flat screen  monitor.
however, i might go for one of those  mini laptops.
in the office, however, there are desktop machines for everyone, and those that travel a lot have laptops as well.
i guess the main  reason is that they are so handy - they take up little space and are portable.
if you'll be using it in the same place 85% of the time or more, i'd say get a nice desktop and a cheap and/or refurbished laptop that you'll use just on occasion and traveling.
i guess the only disadvantage is that i cannot lug it around with me  all the time but then neither do most of my friends using a laptop.
the graphics cards in the laptops now are sufficient for gaming as well, so i am not lacking at all.
i prefer pc over laptop as i like wide screens which laptops cant provide it sucks, because i really like laptops, but your arguments are 100% on, which is why i rarely if ever use mine (and why i got it cheap, just for travel in the first place).
i would like a laptop eventually, when i have the money because it would mean i could watch tv and surf the net.
moreover, ram nowadays is cheap.
you can screw you wrist, shoulders and back up at a desktop bad enough.
laptop is good for professionals while desktop is better for students and medium person being of cheaper accessories.
i believe people still need desktop.
indeed many of us have overlooked the health aspects.
using them like that for hours together is bound to show in increased back and neck stress.
yeah laptops arehandy
most notebook users have no idea what they're doing to themselves.
