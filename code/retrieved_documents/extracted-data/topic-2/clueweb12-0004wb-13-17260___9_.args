this makes the entry to a 17-inch apple laptop a bit more affordable for those that don't necessarily need the slight boosts made in this revision.since most people don't get a macbook pro for gaming, it will be more beneficial to those using it toaccelerate video, bitcoin mining or accelerating applications like photoshop.it still has the same flaws as the version it replaces though including the lack of usb 3.0, a sd card slot and just 4gb of memory compared to most similarly priced laptops featuring twice as much.the increased speed will benefit those that run tasks that actually will utilize the 3d acceleration features.it functions as both a mini-displayport port and a high speed interface for external devices such as storage.a dual layer dvd burner is there for those that still use physical media to load programs or watch movies.everything else remains the same which means that it still has the thinnest profile and lightest weight of 17-inch laptops as well as some of the best battery life.the price remains unchanged which is nice for those that want the added performance.battery life for the macbook pro 17 is still incredible thanks to its large internal lithium polymer battery pack with its 95 whr capacity rating.there are also high performance multi-card or compactflash readers for digital photographers.it is possible to have a custom built model with asolid state drive installed but the cost is just way too much for an already quite expensive system.it still retains the feature where it will switch automatically between the integrated intel hd graphics 3000 that is built into the core i7 processor and the amd radeon graphics when an application requires it.in dvd playback tests, it still exceeds over five hours of playback time which is far longer than the majority of 17-inch laptops on the market.the past amd radeon hd 6750m has been upgraded to the amd radeon hd 6770m. for the most part, this won't have a huge impact for many users.the firewire 800 port is a bit dated now but still can be used for external storage.
