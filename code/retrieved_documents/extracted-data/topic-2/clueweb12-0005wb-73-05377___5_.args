their hardware is rock solid, their software is reasonable, the drivers are strong, the customer support is good and even the battery life is a solid performer.they are cheap, reliable and wonderfully middle-of-the-line.amending my earlier post, when i recommended a net-top it was just for data input and such at school, and i would have foreseen the bulk of the actual work happening at home on the desktop, with such added benefits of cheaper, faster internet thrown in.as long as it's got a decent clock speed, and a decent amount of memory, you'll be fine.i'll be going to college soon, so first and foremost, i'm looking for something that's reliable and built well.you will struggle to find a gaming laptop below $800, but bargains can be found, really for gaming on a budget a desktop is needed.i didn't know much about lenovo laptops at all, but from what i've read seems they're very solidly built and made to last, which is a first on my priority list.alienware is generally too expensive, the m11x is underpowered, explained by the lower price.you can happily run windows 7 along with photoshop and other movie editing software on a dual-core processor with 4gb of ram.a basic gaming desktop, capable of playing any modern game but not about to win any competitions regarding frame rates etc, can be put together for about 400 bucks, then you will need a screen as well.the reason they make such good laptops is because they aim their services at rich executives with expensive suits, fast cars and (probably) small penises.if you just want the game to play acceptably, then many laptops have sufficiently good inbuilt graphics for the job.64 bit operating systems can handle well over 128gb of ram.hi folks, i'll be getting a new laptop soon, but my knowledge on computers and understanding of what i really need is limited.it may not be the best, but it will do the goddamn job, and do it well, and probably save you 100-200 dollars in the process.
