it still relies on the dated usb 2.0 ports and lacks anyusb 3.0 or esata ports for use with high speed storage peripherals.
it still features a decently sized 640gb hard drive that offers a fair amount of space for applications, data and media files.
sony claims that this can achieve up to three hours of dvd playback time.

the bottom line jan 12 2012 - sony's updated vaio ej laptop is an attempt to give the original version a boost in overall performance by moving from the slower core i3 to core i5 mobile processor.
sony equips the vaio ej series laptops with a fairly typical six-cell battery pack that comes with a 4400mah capacity rating.
the display and graphics system also remains unchanged from last year's model.
while it is nice that it can boost performance of encoding video with quicksync enabled applications, it still lacks any real 3d performance for even casual pc gaming.
the graphics are also still the intel hd graphics 3000 that are built into the core i5 processor.
