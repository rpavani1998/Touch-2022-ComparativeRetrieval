linux is (should be) perfect to utilize older hardware because it isn't as bloated as new oss in order to get more modern functionality.if the major manufacturers put as much engineering into the linux desktop as they put into windows, they would produce a superior product for their customers.as far as my home computer, i prefer to work on a tower based system because it allows me to use a large lcd monitor, runs much faster and simply performs better than the laptop.everything else is perfect and overall it suits my needs but as always, it all depends what you want and what trade-offs you are willing to make.in my view, a laptop is a battery powered computer that i can take with me when i board a plane and use it to do work or watch a dvd.of course, having all laptop functions fully operational at all times reduces the battery life.that doesn't mean the laptop isn't a great tool for traveling or for heading over to a starbucks and working wirelessly.what he means is that manufacturers should use components with native linux drivers available and give the option of obtaining the laptop with a linux distro preloaded, or withno os, but with the guarantee that every single feature works with linux, and state that clearly on their sites.i agree with the article if time was spent in configuring a linux laptop instead of a windows one it would be superior in all aspects.like mandriva, it is a distro that supports the free ethos and has a strong community around it with plenty of online-documentation/support, and it seems to 'just work' for a lot of people.so, preserving battery life and connecting wirelessly seem important.in a way, it helps prove up my argument that if linux were bundled on hp, lenovo, dell, gateway and so on, it would be as acceptable to users as is os x or windows.this involved making sure that acpi was off and apm on (lilo and services sections in the control center), using the laptop control in the configuration menu (i use kde) to enable and configure the battery monitoring/power-saving and making a couple of changes to the config file /etc/sysconfig/suspend to fix screen corruption, avoid being asked for a password after resuming and choose services to stop/start.recently, i had the opportunity to install linux on an ibm thinkpad, and both ingenuity and a commitment to complete the job were required.the renown stability of linux implies being able to go for weeks on a desktop without a reboot by simply doing a quick s3 suspend and resume as we've done with the older windows oss.
