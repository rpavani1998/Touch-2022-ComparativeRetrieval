with a free operating system, a community of cooperating hackers would be able to use a computer without starting to deprive his or her friend.ubuntu linux is not only much secure than windows os, but it also includes free apps and renders safe and fast web browsing.depending on your budget, security concerns and familiarity with the computer language, you can pick either of them and successfully run a dynamic website for a long time to come.with this solution you can safeguard the remainder of your personal and software data on a second partition.linux here is substantially cheaper, as it is an open-source system, and most of its applications are also under gnu public licenses – in other words, free.a. linux is free and it comes with a licence known as “gnu gpl”, which grants free use, free access to the source code (linux distributions often come with both binaries and the source code), freedom to copy, modify and distribute it.you have the freedom to distribute modified versions of the program, so that the community can benefit from your improvements.however, cross-platform scripting will never give the smooth performance that a program does when run on its native platform – it is a bit like using emulators to run programs that are not native to the os.it will be necessary to learn from new software, a new interface, with a new manner of making.after losing his community, stallman always had the choice of joining the proprietary software world, writing code under nondisclosure agreements, which he believed divided the software society and a means for not helping a fellow hacker (“someone who loves to program and enjoys being clever about it”) or quitting the computer field, which was rather an unpleasant thing to do as it would have wasted his skills as an operating system developer.while this is demonstrably true – think of the millions of viruses for windows systems, and the rare bug that crops up in linux – it is also true that efficient server administration can render a windows system as secure as a linux one.most of these distributors add up their own features, targeting specific areas like enterprise, desktop, multimedia etc., to the existing gnu system, to cater diverse user sections.however, the learning curve in asp or asp(dot)net is much steeper than in php – something that can backfire for advanced users looking for greater control and freedom.php, however, is still one of the most popular scripts around thanks to its versatility and the solid, useful applications being written using it.windows hosting comes with the added cost of the os, and certain applications that the hosting company has to continually pay for.
