with a price around $1400, it also is quite affordable for such a high level of performance.it comes with a sizable 500gb hard drive that provides plenty of space for applications, data and media files.to do this, they have chosen to use the intel core i7-720qm quad core processor with its auto clocking features to allow the system to function well between single threaded games or multi-threaded desktop video applications.graphics and performance are both very strong and should handle gaming just fine.while the gx740 does an excellent job for gaming albeit with a few quirks with the keyboard, the system actually does a better job at being a more general purpose desktop replacement that also can be used for gaming.color is bright and response times are quick which is good for gaming and fast video.a standard dual layer dvd burner handles playback and recording of cd and dvd media.it should be noted that this battery pack does extend out the back of the laptop behind the screen and can cause issue with some cable placements for the power cord.it spins at the faster 7200rpm desktop rate for improved data access rates.this gives the system a slightly higher 1680x1050 resolution compared to 1600x900 but it still falls short of a full 1080p high definition panel.the msi gx740-079us is a 17-inch laptop that is designed for gamers on the go and it does this job quite well.the right hand shift key is also a smaller size and placed next to the arrow keys that could cause issue for gamers and regular touch typists.this allows the system to fully handle games up to and past the panel's native resolution and even allows for the use of filters.with 1gb memory - gigabit ethernet, 802.11a/g/n wireless, bluetooth - four usb 2.0, esata, expresscard/54, hdmi, vga,the 4gb of ddr3 memory let it cruise through most applications without an issue.
