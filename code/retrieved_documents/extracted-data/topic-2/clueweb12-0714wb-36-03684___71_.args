they control low- level functions, including two- dimensional (2-d) graphics acceleration; support for input devices such as joysticks, keyboards, and mice; and control of sound mixing and sound output.another note to self, buying "bleeding edge" hardware is the surest way to guarantee that things will change and your hardware will be soon outpaced by commodity "mainstream" hardware at half to a third of the price.i'd just hope that eventually, there's more actual competition again, and both companies (and new companies) actually respect and care about standards compliance and that both they and the standards bodies start to care about what customers actually doing with their hardware.not to a 7800-series or comparable, and certainly not to an 8x00 or upcoming 9x00 geforce, unless driver stability improves dramatically, and they can add more real-world-useful features, particularly without the need for windows vista.by requiring the hardware to support to be '10.1 compatible' they are merely pandering to the majority of gamers out there.another great thing about sound in vista is that even with an old ac'97 sound card and just stereo speakers on a desktop or laptop, the sound fidelity is significantly better than xp or os x by several factors.that stuff doesn't cause major programming difficulties and in any case third-party libraries (such as miles in the case of sound) do it better and are more portable than microsoft's stuff.it, however, required a lot more ram and faster cpu in order to run smoothly.a fixed feature set is what allows developers to squeze out every drop of performance from ps2 hardware to make amazing looking graphics, even though your mobile phone might have more processing power available to it.if games are easier to write (skipping over the effectiveness/perceived effectiveness of any 'platform'), then there are more people writing games and becoming developers, which would make the game market more competitive, and thusly we would have better games!from http://www.gamesforwindows.com/en-us/aboutgfw/pag e s/directx10.aspx [gamesforwindows.com] : directxÂ® apis gives multimedia applications access to the advanced features of high-performance hardware such as three-dimensional (3-d) graphics acceleration chips and sound cards.sdl is comparable to directx as it offers control over sound, graphics, mouse/keyboard/joystick.if you get upset every time people make revisions and improvements to software and hardware, i suggest you packup your computer and return it to avoid further heart ache.graphics and computing power is fabulous compared to what it was just a few years ago, and the fact that ms has set an actual standard is kick assbeing able to immediately switch from rendering one small bit, to starting to render something else, which would theorhetically make all of the compiz/aero type stuff be able to run much more smoothly in conjunction with real 3d rendering (ie, games, cad).
