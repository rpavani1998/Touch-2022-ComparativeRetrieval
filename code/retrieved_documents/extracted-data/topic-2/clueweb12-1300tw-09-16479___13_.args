although the new version -- which offers a complete revamp of the ui since the release of windows 95 -- is seemingly well suited for touch-based devices, it's reportedly a headache for the desktop user accustomed to accessing the computer's installed programs through the start menu.this is not what i want, i want to have a clear, clean, fast, customizable utility to do what i desire.whereas i understand them wanting to make the interface identical across all formats of computing, pretty much everyone agrees the metro interface is not as useful on a desktop or laptop pc as it is on a phone or a tablet.just because ram and hdd are cheap (relatively ) doesnt give them the right to keep increasing its usage........these things should happen in the background, and not distract me from doing the things i want (games, internet, word, excel, etc.).i don't understand how there are so many 'common' people that have good ideas, yet microsoft pays millions for a couple of people that clearly don't...i want to see my os do all the back-end stuff (anti-virus, backup, file management, etc.) in the cleanest, fastest way possible.if people want to use them, they can, if they want to go to the start menu or task bar and launch from there as they have in the past, they still could.instead of making touch devices better, they just decide to make the desktop pc worse - that also works to bring them to the same level!let's all call it a day, and jump over to linux, now that all 3 platforms are performing about the same, but at least with linux, you have a simplified user interface, and you can do os customizations via all kinds of advanced menu's and the shell; something which might take forever in windows 8.reller also assured investors that office 15 will feel unaltered in windows 8's desktop mode when using office even though the new suite has been metro-ized.they should at least allow people to turn on the start button from somewhere in the settings, not get rid of it completely.as it stands now, windows 8 doesn't feature a start button, but rather depends on hot corners for essential functionality.without any instructions whatsoever, desktop users must figure out how to navigate through the new metro ui and access the metro commands to get back to the start screen.this is just microsoft seeing apple's success and trying to replicate that in ways and places that just do not work.
