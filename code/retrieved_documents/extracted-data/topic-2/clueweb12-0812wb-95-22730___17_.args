the display has some colour quirks that put it one or two steps below a good desktop display, and it's important to maintain a consistent, front-and-centre viewing angle, but as with the previous generation of this apple laptop, display quality is absolutely acceptable and usable for image assessment and simple photoshop edits in the field, as long as you're aware of the display's particular blend of strengths and weaknesses.all in all, this display is delivering more quality than one could reasonably hope for from a machine in this price class.screen brightness is impressively even, as is black and white photo rendering, while overall colour accuracy is decent.the glass sheet in front of the screen is about as reflective as it could be, which means that in a coffee shop, on an airplane or even a typical office, the glossiness is either a minor irritant or a major distraction, depending on the surroundings and your tolerance for screen reflections.to have a computer this capable, that is also small enough and light enough to slip into pretty much any camera bag, it has been a workflow-altering experience.this is a computer to enjoy in the office, hotel room or at the event, but is too unwieldy for use on most planes, trains and automobiles that you might take to travel to these places.this means it's well put together and it runs the mac os plus various mac-only applications, which for some - including us - is a benefit.overall, the thinkpad t60's 1400 x 1050 pixel flexview display is sweet, and it set a new standard in laptop displays in its time.this pint-sized wonder has sufficient oomph for a variety of tasks, and once we got it outfitted with 2gb ram and a 32gb ssd it has become a constant companion that we've used to import, select and transmit jpegs, edit short video clips plus the usual netbook stuff like email, web browsing and even video chats using the built-in camera.overall colour accuracy is on par with a fine desktop display.in short, the screen was good and it responded well to hardware profiling but overall accuracy was a couple of notches below a good desktop display.outside of that, there's little in the way of real innovation in this model that specifically targets or benefits the field shooter.unlike every other laptop we've ever looked at, the w700 shows no significant colour accuracy errors at all, is only a touch less neutral through white, grey and black than the t60 flexview and reveals just a hint of deep shadow posterization.the mini 9 is a low-budget gem for a number of reasons, including its photography-friendly led-backlit display.each has different strengths, with ips panels generally providing good colour reproduction and the widest viewing angles.
