it achieves this by opting to use the amd fusion platform that consolidates features into fewer parts to keep overall costs down.
this is a bit below average but considering the cost is not a huge tradeoff.
the graphics system is integrated using the amd fusion design.
in dvd playback tests, the system was able to run for just over three hours before going into standby mode.
performance wise, it falls well behind the intel quad core mobile processors for demanding tasks but it does quite well with general purpose tasks and those that want to multitask average productivity programs.
it uses your typical tn panel that offers decent but not outstanding colors or viewing angles.
as with most gateway and acer systems in the past year, the nv75s17u is plagued with a large amount oftrialware applications that come preloaded on the system.
but you still wouldn't want to use it for more than casual pc gaming at lower resolutions and detail levels.
blu-ray playback will yield around two hours as it is more demanding.
the resolution is decent for its price at 1600x900 but it is disappointing that it can't reach a full 1080p high definition resolution for supporting blu-ray movies as best as it can.
this makes it a good option for those that want an affordable laptop with a large display.
it would be nice to see eitherusb 3.0 or esata on this laptop to give it a bit more external expansion capabilities.
while these don't take up much of the storage space compared to the days when hard drives were much smaller, they still can adversely affect the overall performance of the system particularly when a system boots up.
this includes a display that won't do full hd video resolutions and peripheral ports that will limit the effectiveness of external expansion.
the one really bright spot in terms of features on the gateway nv75s17u is the addition of a blu-ray compatible drive.
for this processor, it comes matched up with the amd radeon hd 6620g which is certainly a step above what intel has to offer with its intel hd graphics.

blu-ray playback will yield around two hours as it is more demanding.
for this desktop replacement class system, they chose to use the quad core a8-3500m that falls in the middle of the amd quad core a series processor lineup.
this is a bit below average but considering the cost is not a huge tradeoff.
what it does do is offer a bit more when it comes tousing it with non-3d applications such as photoshop.
the big disappointment is the lack of the high speed peripheral ports used for high speed external storage.
this is another area where gateway seems to be cutting costs a bit.
rather than using an eight or nine cell battery pack, it comes with a six cell version with a relatively low 4000ma capacity rating.
for its price, it certainly does a good job.
while these don't take up much of the storage space compared to the days when hard drives were much smaller, they still can adversely affect the overall performance of the system particularly when a system boots up.
in terms of a budget 17-inch system, it has some good points to it including a quad core processor, improved integrated graphics and a blu-ray compatible drive.
the 17.3-inch display of the gateway nc75s17u is nothing special.
the spec sheet for the gateway nv75s17u may make it seem like a high end desktop replacement laptop but its price under $650 is much more telling.
storage space for applications, data and media files is also quite good thanks to a decently sized 640gb hard drive that is still the size found in most laptops almost twice its price.
for this processor, it comes matched up with the amd radeon hd 6620g which is certainly a step above what intel has to offer with its intel hd graphics.
in dvd playback tests, the system was able to run for just over three hours before going into standby mode.
now, this is not an uncommon battery size in models that are looking to reduce weight but this laptop weighs a pretty hefty 7.3 lbs.
rather than using an eight or nine cell battery pack, it comes with a six cell version with a relatively low 4000ma capacity rating.
for one, it has full direct x 11 support and better overall 3d performance but you still wouldn't want to use it for more than casual pc gaming at lower resolutions and detail levels.

it achieves this by opting to use the amd fusion platform that consolidates features into fewer parts to keep overall costs down.
it does spin at the more traditional 5400rpm rate which gives it modest performance compared to those that use 7200rpm drives.

the graphics system is integrated using the amd fusion design.
still, it is very affordable option for those looking at a low cost media laptop.
what it does do is offer a bit more when it comes tousing it with non-3d applications such as photoshop.
the drive can also handle playback and recording of dvd and cd media.
