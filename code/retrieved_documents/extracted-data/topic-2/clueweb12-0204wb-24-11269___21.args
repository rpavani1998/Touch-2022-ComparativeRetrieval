before people start writing comments about how much better their distributions run than the one i chose, let me say i played no favorites.
the information in the article was useful.
this comment made from a position of relative ignorance as i haven't actually tried either of these distros on my thinkpad (i used plain debian, which also works all the function keys and volume keys 'out of the box' so far as i can tell), but the above is what i have gleaned from postings on the thinkpad mailing list.
but that linux has such a hard time with suspend and resume in general "implies" (i understand why but to newbs this is what it seems like) either someone is asleep at the wheel, or there is some underlying stick in the spokes of the whole linux os preventing it from smoothly implementing such a basic function as a suspend/resume.
the first packages i added include linux-image- 2.6.10-5-686, linux-source-2.10.10 and linux-headers-2.6.10-5.
call it a challenge, but many postings exist on the mailing lists i follow from international users who simply can't afford to upgrade their memory.
to an american, it doesn't seem so unrealistic simply to upgrade.
the user would just do their work and have no adminstration tasks.
i decided to stay with 256mb of ram, primarily so i could help linux users who could not afford to add the memory needed to get to 512mb.
acpi works for suspend-to-ram but not suspend-to-disk.
tpb has a on-screen display (osd) to show volume, mute, brightness and some other informations.
i don't find them necessary and never installed them in 10.1 although they are available without needing any compiling etc. tpctl seems to be installed by default when the installer detects a thinkpad.
last new, i just arrived to configure and connect through wvdial and kinternet, > but the dns connection and lookup failed to view any internet site... > > >
i installed mandrake 10.1 on my toshiba satellite (128mb ram, 20g hard drive) and it has been working great for over 8 months.
suspend-to-ram then worked perfectly using the appropriate keys (fn-f4).
don't fall into that trap if you can avoid it.
magic sys-request is enabled and alt-graphics is enabled as the compose key for áccêntèd chðract€rs.
although the fedora tutorial gave me many of hints on how to configure tools to take advantage of the thinkpad's built-in functionality, fedora did not work for me.
the media, on the other hand, ran with the quote attributed to him.
and, if you look at his history, he did take the initiative and helped create the internet.
tallying the results, i decided to go with an ibm thinkpad.
the package is set up so that make-kpkg compiles the correct driver sources for the kernel you are running.
as far as my home computer, i prefer to work on a tower based system because it allows me to use a large lcd monitor, runs much faster and simply performs better than the laptop.
screenshot of configure-thinkpad here, you need to do some command-line work to get ubuntu to work with the packages you downloaded.
he also has an ibook.
to friends in hungary, the costs seem high.
of course, something that works easily doesn't offer much for a professional problem-solver to write about :-)
every relative newb who tries this thinks there must be something simple they are overlooking to get something so basic to work, hence the newb questions, expecting not a complete set of instructions (which is needed) but a quick one line "just hit this switch or run this one command" - not expecting that to get it to do that is as complicated as it is for them.
when i go out of my home and have to connect me under linux on internet through a basic or standard phone line ...
to use suspend-to-disk you need to create the suspend partition first using a utility from the ibm thinkpad support on the web.
like mandriva, it is a distro that supports the free ethos and has a strong community around it with plenty of online-documentation/support, and it seems to 'just work' for a lot of people.
it can also control the resources used by the parallel and serial ports.
unfortunately, i didn't find configure-thinkpad in the ubuntu repositories.
kde includes the tools for viao toshiba and ibm laptops by default.
i'm reminded of statement attributed to al gore that he "invented the internet".
tpctl gives the user access to all the functions of the smapi bios that are documented in the various thinkpad technical reference manuals.
followed by all of the usual "problems" usually caused by poor research and not paying attention to details.
tpctl contains everything but the drivers.
my partner bought a thinkpad t21 and has liked it a lot.
for others to jump on top of that with bogus pedantic rantings merely cements the misconceptions about the community.
i use a couple of different wi-fi cards (smc 2632w and aironet 340) and also move seamlessly between home and a wi-fi hot-spot.
the media, on the other hand, ran with the quote attributed to him.
fedora and ubunto both include tools for ibm laptops.
specifically, apm does not work for me at all.
it can also control the resources used by the parallel and serial ports.
right now, i'm running my primary desktop system and it has fedora core 4 running at the moment.
of course, having all laptop functions fully operational at all times reduces the battery life.
in a way, it helps prove up my argument that if linux were bundled on hp, lenovo, dell, gateway and so on, it would be as acceptable to users as is os x or windows.
i found ubuntu to work best on my particular laptop.
it is of course well-known that although he is a major pundit, tom never mentions mandriva in his articles for some reason.
next, using synaptic, i searched for "thinkpad" and found thinkpad-base and thinkpad-source.
it takes a a thick hide to hang around this community.
so, i have the same damn laptop and it runs xp and pretty well.
right now i have both (a laptop and a beefy tower), but the tower is more of a server than a workstation.
hope this info helps somebody.
especially useful are things like the way it automatically switches from using wireless to ethernet for example.
not to mention a number of "readers" available.
furthermore tpb supports a software mixer, as the r series thinkpads have no hardware mixer to change the volume.
for this, you need the thinkpad-modules package, which can be built from the thinkpad-source package.
david tansey, a ubuntu user and contributor who has written howtos for the community, provided us with some commands through the thinkpad mailing list.
next, i searched, found and installed the tpb package through ubuntu's synaptic application.
then: cd modules/thinkpad/2.6/drivers make sudo make install this creates the /dev/think device needed to run tpctl.
but yes, i did read the article and yes, i can confirm that the volume and mute buttons and all the special key functions - i.e. reading light on/off, screen brightness, switch to external display, screen off - worked immediately 'out of the box' under mandriva 10.1 .
the added commentary was also useful but it was presented in an adversarial fashion.
let's see i've run suse since 6.2, redhat first started about 4.2 (along with afterstep) heavily into mandrake since 6.0 came out.
after some false starts i learned to do this before doing the full installation (only needs to be done once, not every re-install etc).
once i installed ubuntu on the thinkpad, i had to add packages from various repositories, including universe and multiverse.
to a newb, all the hype and promise of linux evaporates rapidly when faced with that.
your article is great, but it's bit thinkpad oriented.
the only "fast" distro is gentoo, but you have to get a little dirty piecing it together.
in 2005le fn-f3 (screen off) does not work for me - possibly another x issue - and i have had bigger problems with power-saving but every other button and fn key again works (ahem) 'out of the box'.
i only can say: good work, and let those lamers who have nothing better to do then to flame, be what they are: lamers.
once the laptop arrived, i began searching around on google to see which linux distributions people used on thinkpads.
on a slightly different but related issue, tv-out may not work, nor does 3d graphics.
finally, i discovered configure-thinkpad, a gnome gui tool for tpctl.
afaik this is an xorg issue which is the same for all distros although there is a proprietary free-beer driver available which apparently gives 3d graphics and may support tv-out.
it turned out to have very little use and the price was fine.
but, i did find nuggets of gold that allowed me to use my thinkpad the way i wanted.
included are the sources for drivers of the super i/o and rt/cmos ram chips, for an interface to the ibm thinkpad smapi bios, and for an interface to the thinkpad apm subsystem.
seeing comments referring to the battery as a ups gave it away.
my choise was debian without bigger investigations.
to sum up, i suppose that i consider laptops necessary to consultants and sales people.
maybe the reason tom's suse-using friend didn't know they were there was for the same reason (i.e. maybe the laptop works fine with the standard install).
before running around like crazy being leet and cool and grabbing software left and right ..... check out what is already there in your distro.
i find a useful article and it's all creeped out with your mouthy comments.
that doesn't mean the laptop isn't a great tool for traveling or for heading over to a starbucks and working wirelessly.
reading through the archives of the mailing lists, i started to conclude that most people used linux on laptops as portable computers.
thanks for taking the time and making the effort.
linux is (should be) perfect to utilize older hardware because it isn't as bloated as new oss in order to get more modern functionality.
you can download the tarball from the tpctl site, though, and configure it using these steps, once you satisfy all the dependencies.
furthermore, many of the items i did find seemed less than useful.
suspend-to-ram is easily enabled by clicking through a few menus although editing one config file may be necessary.
then, i started asking some hard questions and the answers convinced me that an information void exists.
in a way, it helps prove up my argument that if linux were bundled on hp, lenovo, dell, gateway and so on, it would be as acceptable to users as is os x or windows.
so, if you have a problem with using proper english on a "blog" (linux journal's web site uses blogging software) then please don't comment.
in fact,he said, "during my service in the united states congress, i took the initiative in creating the internet".
first, you need to provide the linux kernel source.
recently, i had the opportunity to install linux on an ibm thinkpad, and both ingenuity and a commitment to complete the job were required.
btw 256mb is more than enough.
if you plan to write comments, you could at least use proper english and correct your typos.
i found linux useful immediately.
with tpb it is possible to bind a program to the thinkpad, mail, home and search button.
in my view, a laptop is a battery powered computer that i can take with me when i board a plane and use it to do work or watch a dvd.
either to disk or to ram, i don't care, it's the one single thing i couldn't get working with gentoo on my laptop (a dell lattitude d800) it does longer on batteries in linux than in windows, but not being able to suspend it really is a pain...
just have a look here: http://www.ubuntu.com/support/custom/hplaptops you see, it is possible.....
included are the sources for drivers of the super i/o and rt/cmos ram chips, for an interface to the ibm thinkpad smapi bios, and for an interface to the thinkpad apm subsystem.
hopefully tom will post a follow-up that gives some more detail about exactly what works and what doesn't including installing and configuring the wireless networking which hopefully is as trivial a non-issue in ubuntu as it was in mandriva.
before people start writing comments about how much better their distributions run than the one i chose, let me say i played no favorites.
well - as long you have an internet-connection, the driver-installation is extremely painless (in windows-xp), as the latest drivers are downloaded from the ms-database.
the purpose of this tool is to make configuring thinkpad easier.
recently, i had the opportunity to install linux on an ibm thinkpad, and both ingenuity and a commitment to complete the job were required.
tpb can also run a callback program on each state change with the changed state and the new state as options.
i use the acpitool -s option, and my ibm thinkpad t21 suspends without problems.
desktop linux on a laptop recently, i bought a laptop.
the author was ignorant of these inclusions (he was running gnome afterall and many of the "included" configurators were in kde) and it would have been great to say, "hey, good info, but did you know that blah, blah, blah....?
the purpose of this tool is to make configuring thinkpad easier.
i believe a manufacturer should do the things i did to get ubuntu working on the thinkpad.
i marked those for installation and clicked apply.
the package is set up so that make-kpkg compiles the correct driver sources for the kernel you are running.
and that one guy is right about having to be thick skinned to dare posting to a linux board.
for this, you need the thinkpad-modules package, which can be built from the thinkpad-source package.
the usage output and the readme file should give a rough idea of what the program can do... packages included in tpctl include: - tpctl -- command line thinkpad control program - ntpctl -- ncurses thinkpad control program - tpctlir -- a utility that enables or disables the infrared subsystem on thinkpads with programmable option select - apmiser -- a daemon that automatically controls power expenditure mode (using tpctl) according to cpu usage
as i continued to research linux on the laptop, i found a scarcity of new material.
but for doing it work, i prefer working on a fast and more powerful pc.
everything else is perfect and overall it suits my needs but as always, it all depends what you want and what trade-offs you are willing to make.
next, using synaptic, i searched for "thinkpad" and found thinkpad-base and thinkpad-source.
ignoring the joky 'fan-boy' subject-line, i do use other distros and now there is a new version of ubuntu i'll try it again when i have time and see if it now meets my needs, especially regarding the easy networking configuration and use.
having said that, i am using linux on every computer in my house and still believe in it.
i have also had toshibas and compaqs.
so, preserving battery life and connecting wirelessly seem important.
it's nice to know that that are reasonable non-windows, non-mac mobile solutions for professionals; thanks for putting another stone on the path that paves the way.
all this material helped me and i'm obviously not as brillant and charismatic as you.
if the major manufacturers put as much engineering into the linux desktop as they put into windows, they would produce a superior product for their customers.
they also thought that the battery life seemed short.
the first packages i added include linux-image- 2.6.10-5-686, linux-source-2.10.10 and linux-headers-2.6.10-5.
you really did manage to take something as simple as installing linux and turn it into a problem.
i have typically used thinkpads in the past and so i am familiar with them.
next, i searched, found and installed the tpb package through ubuntu's synaptic application.
according to theweb site: "configure-thinkpad is a gnome thinkpad configuration tool written by cheuksan edward wang.
i did have an ibook a couple of years ago and it was ok but didn't work that well with linux.
i checked around and other friends were using thinkpads.
i even found a thinkpad mailing list and some distribution-oriented laptop ones.
desktop linux on a laptop recently, i bought a laptop.
no free linux distro will suspend/resume out of the box on a t20 except for possibly suse, which is almost too big for it.
when i got home, i copied my files to this desktop and now i'm set to work again in the us.
tallying the results, i decided to go with an ibm thinkpad.
i believe a manufacturer should do the things i did to get ubuntu working on the thinkpad.
the first laptops were actually portable computers.
the usage output and the readme file should give a rough idea of what the program can do... packages included in tpctl include: tpctl -- command line thinkpad control program ntpctl -- ncurses thinkpad control program tpctlir -- a utility that enables or disables the infrared subsystem on thinkpads with programmable option select apmiser -- a daemon that automatically controls power expenditure mode (using tpctl) according to cpu usage
later, i found the software i needed to make it work the way one would expect from a manufacturer.
perhaps if i upgraded to a higher level of memory, i could use fedora.
i noticed the ability to change the volume and use other keys immediately.
it simply performed the best in this case.
according to thetpb web site: tpb is a little program that enables you to use the ibm thinkpad(tm) special keys.
he didn't say anything about a piece of junk that wouldn't run xp so let's try linux.
i don't think i could have survived another hour if i didn't know that.
i decided to stay with 256mb of ram, primarily so i could help linux users who could not afford to add the memory needed to get to 512mb.
he said, the linux desktop works.
as i continued to research linux on the laptop, i found a scarcity of new material.
at 256mb of ram, however, fedora creeped.
david tansey, a ubuntu user and contributor who has written howtos for the community, provided us with some commands through the thinkpad mailing list.
once i added the packages, i rebooted into the linux 686 environment.
most of the times you don't even need the driver-cd.
last week, i took my recently acquired laptop to the middle east with me and it worked fine.
the original note was written may 1897 in the author's hand.
according to the maintainer's web site: this package contains the source code for the loadable driver modules used by the tpctl utility for configuring ibm thinkpad laptop computers.
i don't use the internal modem and have a pcmcia wi-fi card i.e. it is not a model with built-in wireless card.
the renown stability of linux implies being able to go for weeks on a desktop without a reboot by simply doing a quick s3 suspend and resume as we've done with the older windows oss.
i agree with the article if time was spent in configuring a linux laptop instead of a windows one it would be superior in all aspects.
again, hopfully this is not something unusual otherwise i'll start to understand why some people think desktop linux is so difficult.
when you installed linux-source, it downloaded linux-source-2.6.10.tar.bz2 into the directory /usr/src.
once i added the packages, i rebooted into the linux 686 environment.
the poster had a legitimate comment.
and, if you look at his history, he did take the initiative and helped create the internet.
i marked those for installation and clicked apply.
the person who created this page did do this with the intent to share information.
so, i just went to ebay and bought one.
in fact,he said, "during my service in the united states congress, i took the initiative in creating the internet".
later, i found the software i needed to make it work the way one would expect from a manufacturer.
once i installed ubuntu on the thinkpad, i had to add packages from various repositories, including universe and multiverse.
to unpack it, use the command sudo tar jxvf linux-source-2.6.10.tar.bz2 now, your sources are available.
it simply performed the best in this case.
i also want to use the time to work.
but xp does seem to need a minimum of about 10gigs space), exited the install, created the suspend partition then installed mandriva.
at 256mb of ram, however, fedora creeped.
tpb has a on-screen display (osd) to show volume, mute, brightness and some other informations.
8-) hello dear ibm, linux and suse, users or experts, this article seems very interesting and perhaps around it, you could give me some helpfull advices about linux t21 modem software customization.
i need that there was a running modem or linmodem to surf above internet and retrieve informations or mails outside !
as the web page refers to tpctl, i searched for that package in synaptic and also installed it.
i think you added enormous value to the experience by pointing that out.
when you installed linux-source, it downloaded linux-source-2.6.10.tar.bz2 into the directory /usr/src.
if you want a snappy window manager on a low powered system, the easy trick is to use a lightweight window manager like blackbox.
the next one was a compaq and finally i bought an ibm portable.
i'm reminded of statement attributed to al gore that he "invented the internet".
hey troll, you didn't read the article.
my next adventure will include installing freenx on the laptop to see if i can sync my directories while on the road.
i was pretty sure they kept the laptop biz.
it's gnome based and easy to sync directories when i return.
as you might guess, they didn't use them.
best regards that's not what he meant, that's support from the distro out, not support from the vendor itself.
i went back to my friends and began asking how they used the function keys and buttons on their thinkpads.
according to the maintainer's web site: this package contains the source code for the loadable driver modules used by the tpctl utility for configuring ibm thinkpad laptop computers.
you certainly can use a laptop as a portable computer, but that's not how i intended to use it.
the trackpoint works too as does a usb mouse and external keyboard.
i have had no problem, well thats maybe an understatement, sometimes after suspending the laptop xwindow is kind of schrewed up, but this is how i do it.
i have an ibm thinkpad t21 on which i have installed linux 2.6 within suse 9.3, and unlucky, there was a winmodem installed on, combined with an ethernet connection.
it creates a bad experience for the rest of us.
they also thought that the battery life seemed short.
i wanted performance and i got it with ubuntu.
nice article, but the gentleman's name was spelled "clemens."
i went back to my friends and began asking how they used the function keys and buttons on their thinkpads.
but i guess the vendors would rather download all these anti-programs and give the customer crap software with otherwise outstanding hardware.
" making people feel like a twit in order to appear superior is a small-minded tactic and does the community no favors.
you certainly can use a laptop as a portable computer, but that's not how i intended to use it.
reading through the archives of the mailing lists, i started to conclude that most people used linux on laptops as portable computers.
what he means is that manufacturers should use components with native linux drivers available and give the option of obtaining the laptop with a linux distro preloaded, or withno os, but with the guarantee that every single feature works with linux, and state that clearly on their sites.
i even found a thinkpad mailing list and some distribution-oriented laptop ones.
unfortunately, i didn't find configure-thinkpad in the ubuntu repositories.
then, i started asking some hard questions and the answers convinced me that an information void exists.
but, i did find nuggets of gold that allowed me to use my thinkpad the way i wanted.
if you need to run ndiswrapper for something as common (we're talking laptops here) as a wireless card then your system isnot well supported.
with tpb it is possible to bind a program to the thinkpad, mail, home and search button.
i also know how to multi-boot.... ooooooooooooo.....
thinkpad-source contains the source code for the drivers.
to an american, it doesn't seem so unrealistic simply to upgrade.
they didn't have batteries.
the original note was written may 1897 in the author's hand.
furthermore tpb supports a software mixer, as the r series thinkpads have no hardware mixer to change the volume.

tpb can also run a callback program on each state change with the changed state and the new state as options.
it doubles as the computer i use to make presentations.
to friends in hungary, the costs seem high.
i used the partitioning tool in the mandriva installer to shrink the xp ntfs partition first (works very well and no data loss btw
call it a challenge, but many postings exist on the mailing lists i follow from international users who simply can't afford to upgrade their memory.
screenshot of configure-thinkpad here, you need to do some command-line work to get ubuntu to work with the packages you downloaded.
tom's article is ok as far as it goes but doesn't really say much except to advise you to install a few well-known thinkpad utilities.
this involved making sure that acpi was off and apm on (lilo and services sections in the control center), using the laptop control in the configuration menu (i use kde) to enable and configure the battery monitoring/power-saving and making a couple of changes to the config file /etc/sysconfig/suspend to fix screen corruption, avoid being asked for a password after resuming and choose services to stop/start.
of course, having all laptop functions fully operational at all times reduces the battery life.
i may have two trips and three presentations between now and early september and i'll take the laptop with me and use it for both presentation purposes and to work while i'm away.
i don't think ubuuntu is particularly faster, it's just that it installs a lot less by default so you don't have a pile of daemons using up your lovely memory and then making everything go v e r y s
making the thinkpad act like a laptop later this month, i will cross the globe.
did the above config steps and fn-f12 suspend-to-disk was functioning.
thinkpad-source contains the source code for the drivers.
i also want to use the time to work.
i had very old gentoo release with outdated packages, so i didn't want't to recompile allmost every package i have.
you can download the tarball from the tpctl site, though, and configure it using these steps, once you satisfy all the dependencies.
seeing comments referring to the battery as a ups gave it away.
and i found it very frustrating - download this driver download this anti-something program.
in fact i've got a couple of old 233mhz thinkpads running as semi-thin clients.
most of the time (as in 99.9%) i don't need to create non ascii documents.
as the web page refers to tpctl, i searched for that package in synaptic and also installed it.
according to theweb site: "configure-thinkpad is a gnome thinkpad configuration tool written by cheuksan edward wang.
