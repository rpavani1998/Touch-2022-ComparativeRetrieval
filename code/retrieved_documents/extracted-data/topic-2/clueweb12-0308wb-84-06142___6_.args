performance is good even with the core i3 processor and the media features including the blu-ray compatible drive are a nice addition.this is one step up from intel's base core i3 model and fares very well compared to the lower end core i5 dual core processors thanks to its clock speed bump.this is a good resolution compared to those found in smaller laptops but it falls short of the necessary pixels to fully support 1080p high definition video streams which is a bit disappointing.for the hard drive, sony uses a fairly typical 500gb hard drive that provides plenty of storage space for applications, data and media files.this is a good processor for dealing with hd video or playing casual games but it falls short for anyone who wants to play 3d games seriously on the laptop.this is a good processor for dealing with hd video or playing casual games butin addition to being able to play blu-ray movies, the drive can also be used to record and playback cds and dvds.like most laptops today, it uses a glossy coating but it didn't tend to produce as much glare or reflections as many others on the market.rather than a faster 7200rpm spin rate drive that is equivalent to desktop speeds, it uses the more sedate 5400rpm rate that does impact data access speeds somewhat.the feel is a bit softer than previous models but this may likely be by design so that it can accommodate a silicon based keyboard skin to prevent debris or liquid from getting inside the keyboard.while priced under $1000, there are similarly equipped laptops from the likes of gateway and toshiba that can be found for even less.the 4gb of memory should help keep multitasking issues to a minimum.in order to achieve these dimensions, sony uses a relatively small 3500mah battery pack.compatible - solid performance from core i3 processor - glossy display coating does better than average job with reflections and glare cons - slightly more expensive than similarly equipped laptops - display falls short of full 1080p video support - dedicated graphics best suited for hdin my dvd rundown test, the laptop was able to run just over two and a quarter hours before going into standby mode.
