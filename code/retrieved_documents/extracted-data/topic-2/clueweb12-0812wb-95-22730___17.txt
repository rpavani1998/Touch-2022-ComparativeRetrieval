do these two different panels also differ in  display quality and profilability?
this probably partly explains the areas in which it trails the t60's flexview display, including: the w700 has many fine features for photographers, but the standout feature is the combination of its display and easy-to-use embedded calibrator (we say more about the calibrator and its software in the testing notes section on the next page).

the thinkpad w700 is the antithesis of the mini 9.
in fact, looking from the extreme left, extreme right or practically straight down, the onscreen appearance of a picture doesn't really change from being slightly darker and slightly flatter than the straight-on view.
the rest of this portable computer is typical of the current apple: it's sleek, skinny and beautiful to behold.
a truer photo of the thinkpad w700 is below, with a mini 9 for scale.
at the time, apple was beginning the transition to led backlights in its laptop line, and what we found was the display was incrementally better than the company's previous offerings in this size and offered a decent platform for assessing and doing basic adjusting of pictures in the field.
eighteen months have elapsed since then, and the laptop display landscape has changed plenty.
starting on a positive note, the display quality is comparable to what we've seen before in earlier editions of the led-backlit macbook pro 15 inch.
this is explained partly by its 1920 x 1200 pixel resolution; that's a lot of pixels to stuff into a 17 inch (diagonal) display, which means each pixel is particularly small.
and lenovo has delivered: the w700 is a powerful photo processing machine that, when tricked out with all the options, includes a 2.53ghz intel core 2 quad extreme processor, 8gb ram, nvidia quadro fx 3700m graphics, 17 inch (diagonal), 1920 x 1200 pixel, matte-surface display with dual fluorescent (ccfl) backlights, twin raid-configured hard drives, three video out ports (vga, dual-link dvi and displayport), compactflash slot, expresscard 34 slot, a miniature wacom tablet and a custom hueypro calibrator in the palmrest.
the w700 is lenovo's effort to create a notebook  computer that would have the key features photographers told them they wanted,  from fast raw conversions to a built-in compactflash reader and everything  in-between.

this also means we needed to see if its glossy screen was both tolerable to use, profilable and at least on par with the quality of the previous generation macbook pro 15 inch.
the only real  colour hangups are oversaturated reds and oranges, including skin tones to some  extent, plus there's a slight pink shift in lighter reds.

in its heyday back in 2006-2007, the t60  could be configured with a 14.1 inch, 1400 x 1050 pixel, matte-surface flexview  display featuring in-plane switching (ips) panel technology.
- even screen brightness there is slight darkening in the upper corners, otherwise it's about as even from edge to edge as a better quality desktop display.
note: some online sleuthing turns up the fact that apple may be sourcing display panels for this mac from more than one manufacturer.

the screen is also exceptionally sharp.
move your head far away from the sweet spot and photos retain their slightly darker and slightly flatter appearance.
we looked at a total of 81  pictures, gathered over time to evaluate computer displays, both desktop and  laptop.
the only truly bothersome feature of the mini 9 that's brought about by its small size has been the cramped keyboard, and that's mostly because of the odd placement of the right shift key.
that's understating it: most of the time we're not even aware of its gloss, let alone bothered by it.
like the late-2008 macbook pro 15 inch, the mini 9's display is glossy, and it's not available in a matte surface.
the w700 has many  fine features for photographers, but the standout feature is the combination of  its display and easy-to-use embedded calibrator (we say more about the  calibrator and its software in the testing notes section on the next page).
colour  accuracy is also very good, but not quite at the level of the three attributes  listed above.
but only slightly, the shift is quite subtle.
its 1.6ghz intel atom-series processor  chokes on raw conversions - it'll do them, if you're really patient - but for  photo browsing and basic image editing steps the performance is okay.
in an airplane with a mix of window shades open and closed, for example, the reflections become much worse, obscuring sections of not just darker photos but all photos, as well as the photoshop panels and other interface elements around the periphery.
but be careful what you wish for: by giving photographers almost everything on their wish list, lenovo has created a pc that is so darned big it seriously stretches the definition of a portable computer.
rounding  out this featherweight computer are three usb ports (which are fast for usb in  our testing), 802.11g wi-fi, 10/100 ethernet, vga monitor out and bluetooth.
dell inspiron mini 9
aperture and photoshop cs4 users will appreciate the beefier graphics  subsystem, while the keyboard and trackpad are nice.
this is not the first glossy laptop display of this size we've used, but it's by far the most reflective.
several of the photos are in three different colour  spaces - srgb, adobe rgb and prophoto rgb.
unfortunately, at least from a photographer's perspective, a few things were lost in the transition to the sleek new design, including a firewire 400 port, one usb 2.0 port and a matte display option.
each has different strengths, with ips panels generally providing good colour reproduction and the widest viewing angles.
starting on a positive note, the  display quality is comparable to what we've seen before in earlier editions of  the led-backlit macbook pro 15 inch.
trouble is, somebody forgot to mention that to the designers, because both the t60, and the w700 discussed next, incorporate displays geared to pro photography.

coaxing the display to give this level of accuracy is simple, thanks to the built-in pantone calibrator (which is an embedded version of a huey colorimeter utilizing a custom filter set tuned to the w700 display).
if only to see what all the fuss was about.
that's because maximum screen luminance, which was at about 180 cd/m2 when we got it, has already faded to about 135cd/m2, and once it dips below about 110 cd/m2 it will be getting too dim to be usable for accurate photo viewing in anything other than low ambient light.
hands on: the w700's trackpad, optional built-in calibrator and wacom tablet.
this means it's well put together and it runs the mac os plus various mac-only applications, which for some - including us - is a benefit.
the mini 9 and thinkpad t60 also have sharp displays, while the late-2008 macbook pro 15 inch's display is slightly softer.
outside of that, there's little in the way of real innovation in this model that specifically targets or benefits the field shooter.

for a computer that starts at about us$300 in the u.s. right now, we had modest expectations.
weight watcher: a side view of the late-2008 apple macbook pro 15 inch (photo by rob galbraith/little guy media)
unlike every other laptop we've ever looked at, the w700 shows no  significant colour accuracy errors at all, is only a touch less neutral through  white, grey and black than the t60 flexview and reveals just a hint of deep  shadow posterization.
as it turns out, the display profiles well, neutrals are reasonably neutral with minimal colour shifting in whites, grays or blacks and overall colour accuracy is very good for a laptop.
accessorize: the optional compactflash slot.
well, make that four laptops.
all in all, this  display is delivering more quality than one could reasonably hope for from a  machine in this price class.
to that end, we've gathered and tested the displays in three current laptops: thelate-2008 macbook pro 15 inch, lenovo thinkpad w700 and dell inspiron mini 9.
overall, the thinkpad t60's 1400 x 1050 pixel  flexview display is sweet, and it set a new standard in laptop displays in its  time.
we saw the result, nicknamed  the mattebook pro by the company, earlier this month at the macworld expo trade  show in san francisco, and it looks really well done.

there is also some unevenness in brightness top to bottom, though this is mitigated by the fact the screen isn't terribly tall.
to have a computer this capable,  that is also small enough and light enough to slip into pretty much any camera  bag, it has been a workflow-altering experience.
trying placing a print in front your laptop's display, then viewing that from a variety of angles, and you'll have an idea of how wide this display's viewing angle is.
the w700 is lenovo's effort to create a notebook computer that would have the key features photographers told them they wanted, from fast raw conversions to a built-in compactflash reader and everything in-between.
several of the photos are in three different colour spaces - srgb, adobe rgb and prophoto rgb.
briefly, there are three broad categories of lcd panel types: twisted nematic (tn), vertical alignment (va, and variants like pva and mva) and ips.
in short, the screen was good and it responded well to hardware  profiling but overall accuracy was a couple of notches below a good desktop  display.
togetherness: the mini 9 and a small kit of nikon gear inside a think tank  photo streetwalker pro backpack.
the only truly bothersome feature of the mini 9 that's brought about by its  small size has been the cramped keyboard, and that's mostly because of the odd  placement of the right shift key.
lenovo thinkpad w700 last but definitely not  least is the thinkpad w700.
the  w700's display is really, really good, but it's not perfect.
the mini  9's optimum viewing position is the only position in which you get the screen's  full goodness.
we saw the result, nicknamed the mattebook pro by the company, earlier this month at the macworld expo trade show in san francisco, and it looks really well done.
a representative said that the matte panel they swap in is the same as the one they take out, except for the glossy finish (though this doesn't necessarily guarantee that the display's characteristics will be an exact match or that it will respond the same way to profiling).
wide, wide viewing angle like all laptop displays, this one has a viewing  position sweet spot.
for evenness, this display is average at best.
the mini 9 is a low-budget gem for a number of  reasons, including its photography-friendly led-backlit display.
the w700's display darkens noticeably in the upper corners, and has an overly light strip that runs almost the full width of the lower edge.
unlike every other laptop we've ever looked at, the w700 shows no significant colour accuracy errors at all, is only a touch less neutral through white, grey and black than the t60 flexview and reveals just a hint of deep shadow posterization.
apple macbook  pro 15 inch released in the fourth quarter of 2008, this computer's  display incorporates an all-glass front designed to minimize flex in the lid.
the u.s.-based computer repair outfit's  us$199 service sees the glass front removed and the glossy panel underneath  replaced with a matte panel and bezel surround.
a representative said  that the matte panel they swap in is the same as the one they take out, except  for the glossy finish (though this doesn't necessarily guarantee that the  display's characteristics will be an exact match or that it will respond the  same way to profiling).
the panel  in the unit we tested is model "9c84" (as described in the metadata  of its default monitor profile), while there are apparently units of the same  mac with "9c85" panels.
we know of no ips screens in current-model laptops, thinkpads or otherwise, and it's a shame, because our t60's flexview display has some killer attributes.
the left/right viewing angles are more forgiving, to a point; exceed a certain angle and image reversal kicks in.
this means it's  well put together and it runs the mac os plus various mac-only applications,  which for some - including us - is a benefit.
overall hue accuracy, in fact, is better than the late-2008 macbook pro 15 inch.
it's easily the best laptop screen we've encountered  for viewing black-and-white photos.
overall, the thinkpad t60's 1400 x 1050 pixel flexview display is sweet, and it set a new standard in laptop displays in its time.
the rest of this portable computer is typical of the current apple: it's sleek,  skinny and beautiful to behold.
secondarily, and far less noticeable, are slight yellow and blue shifts in open shadows.
profiling is as easy as launching the included hueypro application, closing the  lid, waiting 70 seconds for three short beeps to signal the end of the  measurement process, opening the lid, choosing a colour temperature and gamma  and that's it.
to have a computer this capable, that is also small enough and light enough to slip into pretty much any camera bag, it has been a workflow-altering experience.
a purchase of a used t60 equipped with this same display, however, may not be the best idea, unless you can find one with a backlight that hasn't faded much.
but it can be a  pain, if not downright impractical on occasion, to drag along a full-size  laptop for this.
the profiling tools we used are described at the end of the article.
flexview display featuring in-plane switching (ips) panel technology.
from the time you think of profiling the display to the time you're done is three minutes, tops.
the photos themselves are a mix of black and white and colour, some with muted shades and some that are richly saturated, some that are moody and some that are high key.
screen brightness is impressively even, as  is black and white photo rendering, while overall colour accuracy is decent.
if you roll your cursor over the photo below, you'll see  an example of this in an environment that rates as only mildly reflective, and  the resulting reflections are at the minor irritant level.
its contrastiness is also a contributing factor.
you won't see the fairly rosy picture  being described above unless you're looking straight at the screen.
in all cases the displays were profiled with a monitor profiling package consisting of a colorimeter or spectrophotometer for screen measurements and software to create the profile.
in its heyday back in 2006-2007, the t60 could be configured with a 14.1 inch, 1400 x 1050 pixel, matte-surface
also note that we haven't tested the slide-out second screen of the w700ds.
secondarily, and far less noticeable, are slight yellow and  blue shifts in open shadows.
as you'll read in the testing  notes section ahead, we worked through a handful of monitor profiling packages  with each computer.
in an airplane with  a mix of window shades open and closed, for example, the reflections become  much worse, obscuring sections of not just darker photos but all photos, as  well as the photoshop panels and other interface elements around the periphery.
lenovo thinkpad w700 last but definitely not least is the thinkpad w700.
still, we concluded that apple was making one of the finest laptop screens we'd seen for use in a pro digital photography workflow.
- colour shifts with viewing angle changing your head position up or down brings about an obvious change in skin tones (and anything else in the red/yellow/orange range), while a yellowy-red cast intrudes when looking at the screen from the extreme left or right.
that's because maximum  screen luminance, which was at about 180 cd/m2 when we got it, has already  faded to about 135cd/m2, and once it dips below about 110 cd/m2 it will be  getting too dim to be usable for accurate photo viewing in anything other than  low ambient light.
what follows is an assessment of the screens in these four road machines, done in a manner similar to ourjuly 2007 report.
some shadow posterization is visible too, but it's not significant.
if you must have  this computer, or you've already taken the plunge and find that you can't get  comfortable with its ultraglossy display, you may wish to investigate techrestore's matte screen alternative.
mini might: the dell inspiron  mini 9.

and as long as the ambient light is subdued.
ibm/lenovo thinkpad t60 the thinkpad series from lenovo is their business laptop line.
it's  worth all of that and more.
the w700ds variant adds a 10.6 inch, 768 x 1280 pixel  led-backlit second display that slides out from behind the main one.
note: the w700 is available with either a standard 17 inch display (called  17" wxga+ lcd 200 nit on lenovo's order pages) or the twin-backlight  premium one we tested (which goes by 17" wuxga 400nit tft).

move  your head far away from the sweet spot and photos retain their slightly darker  and slightly flatter appearance.
we've not been able to find out what kind of panel it uses, but wes williams, worldwide thinkpad product marketing manager at lenovo, was able to tell us what it's not: ips.
the key  point to remember for now is that we did all evaluations with a profile loaded  that produced the best result, so that each display was putting its best foot  forward.

note: the w700 is available with either a standard 17 inch display (called 17" wxga+ lcd 200 nit on lenovo's order pages) or the twin-backlight premium one we tested (which goes by 17" wuxga 400nit tft).
overall hue accuracy, in  fact, is better than the late-2008 macbook pro 15 inch.
the photos themselves are a mix of black and white and colour, some  with muted shades and some that are richly saturated, some that are moody and  some that are high key.
the display has  some colour quirks that put it one or two steps below a good desktop display,  and it's important to maintain a consistent, front-and-centre viewing angle,  but as with the previous generation of this apple laptop, display quality is  absolutely acceptable and usable for image assessment and simple photoshop  edits in the field, as long as you're aware of the display's particular blend  of strengths and weaknesses.
as you can see in the photo below, the diminutive  dell slips easily into this compact, narrow photo backpack and leaves plenty of  room for a carry-about camera kit (the mini 9 is on the left side of the bag in  the photo on the right).
profiling is as easy as launching the included hueypro application, closing the lid, waiting 70 seconds for three short beeps to signal the end of the measurement process, opening the lid, choosing a colour temperature and gamma and that's it.
the result is  a mix of good news and bad news.
as you can see in the photo below, the diminutive dell slips easily into this compact, narrow photo backpack and leaves plenty of room for a carry-about camera kit (the mini 9 is on the left side of the bag in the photo on the right).
the small size of the screen, and its comparatively duller glossiness, means that reflections are less of a problem.

in short, the screen was good and it responded well to hardware profiling but overall accuracy was a couple of notches below a good desktop display.
and that it does, as the lid is both impressively thin and impressively rigid.
at the time, apple was beginning the transition to led  backlights in its laptop line, and what we found was the display was  incrementally better than the company's previous offerings in this size and  offered a decent platform for assessing and doing basic adjusting of pictures  in the field.
but  there's something else good going on in this display that makes sharp pictures  and text look especially edgy.
it's easily the best laptop screen we've encountered for viewing black-and-white photos.
that said, the colour shifts in this screen brought on by a change in viewing angle we'd rank as being less than most, even if the t60's flexview display is better.

a truer photo of the  thinkpad w700 is below, with a mini 9 for scale.
they include: colour accuracy is also very good, but not quite at the level of the three attributes listed above.
from the time you think of profiling the display to the time  you're done is three minutes, tops.
the glass sheet in front of the screen is about as reflective as it could be, which means that in a coffee shop, on an airplane or even a typical office, the glossiness is either a minor irritant or a major distraction, depending on the surroundings and your tolerance for screen reflections.
as you'll read in the testing notes section ahead, we worked through a handful of monitor profiling packages with each computer.
when the inspiron mini 9 arrived, it quickly became  clear it was going to be useful for a lot more than setting up remotes.
you won't see the fairly rosy picture being described above unless you're looking straight at the screen.
whatever criticisms we have about that, however, melt  away when the computer is switched on and a photo is opened across its 17 inch  display.
the only significant colour error is in reds and oranges, which  are considerably skewed in both hue and saturation and really don't look right  on this display.
so yes, we're not crazy about the size.
do these two different panels also differ in display quality and profilability?
this  pint-sized wonder has sufficient oomph for a variety of tasks, and once we got  it outfitted with 2gb ram and a 32gb ssd it has become a constant companion  that we've used to import, select and transmit jpegs, edit short video clips  plus the usual netbook stuff like email, web browsing and even video chats  using the built-in camera.
trouble is, somebody forgot to mention that to the  designers, because both the t60, and the w700 discussed next, incorporate  displays geared to pro photography.
aperture and photoshop cs4 users will appreciate the beefier graphics subsystem, while the keyboard and trackpad are nice.
hands on: the w700's  trackpad, optional built-in calibrator and wacom tablet.
some wide angle perspective distortion in the photo leading off this article underplays its size.
thanks in part to the mini 9,  i've personally switched to using thethink tank photo streetwalker pro for  light duty gear carrying.
this doesn't, however, impact how photos look on the display (nor does it impair the watching of movies).
what follows is an assessment of the screens in these four road machines,  done in a manner similar to ourjuly 2007 report.
unfortunately, at least from a photographer's  perspective, a few things were lost in the transition to the sleek new design,  including a firewire 400 port, one usb 2.0 port and a matte display option.
we set out to do the same with the w700, but once we saw  how good the results were from the built-in huey we couldn't think of a  compelling enough reason to continue.
colour shifts with viewing angle changing your head position up or down  brings about an obvious change in skin tones (and anything else in the  red/yellow/orange range), while a yellowy-red cast intrudes when looking at the  screen from the extreme left or right.
all in all, the late-2008 macbook  pro 15 inch has a decent, profilable display, much like the previous generation  of this model, but is marred by an omnipresent glare from its mirror-like front.
deep shadow posterization, a common laptop screen problem, is present but kept  to a minimum.
whatever criticisms we have about that, however, melt away when the computer is switched on and a photo is opened across its 17 inch display.
the w700's display is really, really good, but it's not perfect.
the left/right viewing angles are more forgiving, to a point; exceed a  certain angle and image reversal kicks in.
while  discontinued - and not always readily available when it was still officially an  option - this laptop's display is so well regarded by those outside the world  of photography that when we needed to replace a windows laptop in the fall of  2007, we opted for this computer with this screen.
we've not been  able to find out what kind of panel it uses, but wes williams, worldwide  thinkpad product marketing manager at lenovo, was able to tell us what it's  not: ips.
its characteristics are very similar to the macbook pro 15 inch we wrote about in july 2007, and others we've set up since.
but be careful  what you wish for: by giving photographers almost everything on their wish  list, lenovo has created a pc that is so darned big it seriously stretches the  definition of a portable computer.

- wide, wide viewing angle like all laptop displays, this one has a viewing position sweet spot.
why does  the panel technology matter?
but there's something else good going on in this display that makes sharp pictures and text look especially edgy.
note: some online sleuthing turns up the fact that apple may be  sourcing display panels for this mac from more than one manufacturer.
thanks in part to the mini 9, i've personally switched to using thethink tank photo streetwalker pro for light duty gear carrying.
it's a major distraction.
also, we're not sure how much  longer this monitor is going to deliver the goods.
we know of no  ips screens in current-model laptops, thinkpads or otherwise, and it's a shame,  because our t60's flexview display has some killer attributes.
some shadow  posterization is visible too, but it's not significant.
the mini 9's optimum viewing position is the only position in which you get the screen's full goodness.
the only real colour hangups are oversaturated reds and oranges, including skin tones to some extent, plus there's a slight pink shift in lighter reds.
as it turns out, the display profiles well, neutrals are  reasonably neutral with minimal colour shifting in whites, grays or blacks and  overall colour accuracy is very good for a laptop.
still, we concluded that apple was making one of the finest laptop  screens we'd seen for use in a pro digital photography workflow.
other than the restrictive viewing position, the only  other sign the mini 9 contains an inexpensive panel is the pronounced ghosting  when moving windows around.
bad things happen when the viewing angle shifts up, down, left or right, with the up/down angles bringing about big brightness and colour shifts.
the mini 9 is a low-budget gem for a number of reasons, including its photography-friendly led-backlit display.
trying placing a print in front your laptop's  display, then viewing that from a variety of angles, and you'll have an idea of  how wide this display's viewing angle is.
this also means we needed to see  if its glossy screen was both tolerable to use, profilable and at least on par  with the quality of the previous generation macbook pro 15 inch.
the above assumes a fixed, head-on viewing position.
