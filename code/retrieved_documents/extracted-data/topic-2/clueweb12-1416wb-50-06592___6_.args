it's quite affordable to have a lappie with 3gb or 4gb ram, which translates to a speedy performer.however, many are not aware of the health hazards that using a laptop presents.i guess the main reason is that they are so handy - they take up little space and are portable.due to it's portability, a lot of people work with a laptop in awkward positions - lying on the bed, hunched over it on a park bench and so on.if you'll be using it in the same place 85% of the time or more, i'd say get a nice desktop and a cheap and/or refurbished laptop that you'll use just on occasion and traveling.using them like that for hours together is bound to show in increased back and neck stress.however, laptops are great when i travel (when i pretend i'm doing work, when i'm actually watching a film =p) i do find that when i'm working or watching a film, after a while my back/neck just starts to ache.i will always prefer desktops because they are so much easier to upgrade and parts are cheaper for them then laptops.in the office, however, there are desktop machines for everyone, and those that travel a lot have laptops as well.i would like a laptop eventually, when i have the money because it would mean i could watch tv and surf the net.but i would definitely buy a desktop for a wider flat screen monitor and for speed .i think both are complimentary and can't outdo much .the small screens (in majority) and tiny closely set keyboards are not exactly ergonomic either.using them placed on your lap for even half an hour would fry your private parts and might stop the blood circulation on your legs as well.laptop is good for professionals while desktop is better for students and medium person being of cheaper accessories.i guess the only disadvantage is that i cannot lug it around with me all the time but then neither do most of my friends using a laptop.
