the 500gb hard drive is fairly typical of the desktop replacement market now and provides a good amount of space for applications and data.this allows the system to be used as a mobile high definition blu-ray player or for playback and recording of cd and dvd media.it uses a standard glossy coating like most laptops do now that can be prone to glare and reflections in certain lighting conditions.this provides for a very smooth overall experience in most computing tasks.it does spin at a more traditional 5400rpm spin rate rather than the faster 7200rpm desktop rate which impacts performance slightly.an optional 9-cell battery pack option is available that will give it more running time but add to its bulk and cost.the inspiron 17r comes with a few key applications but without as much bloat as competing systems which clutter the system and performance.the glossy exterior will quickly pick up fingerprints and smudges but the interior is a bit more resistant albeit still glossy.this includes a new external case design that has a sleeker look and profile that the last version.it does a decent job of being a good general purpose desktop replacement without costing too much.it will fall short of higher end core i5 and core i7 processors but most people probably won't see the difference unless they do video editing or similar heavy computing tasks.it is sufficient for handling all hd video streaming and casual pc gaming but will likely have to play 3d games below the panel's full resolution.lt;/p> to keep the profile slimmer on the inspiron 17r, dell ships most with a standard 6-cell battery pack.this high end model comes equipped with a higher resolution display and blu-ray drive.the 17.3-inch panel uses a 1600x900 resolution that falls short of providing full 1080p hd video support.the panel does use an led backlight that provides a good level of color but a tad bit more subdued in brightness.
