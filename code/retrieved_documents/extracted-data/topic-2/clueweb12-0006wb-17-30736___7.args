the big issue for many with this laptop is going to be the graphics themselves.
like many laptops on the market, the msi fr720-002us comes with a six-cell battery pack rated at 4400ma capacity.
in particular, a blu-ray compatible drive would be a nice step up from the base included dual-layer dvd burner.

this isn't a major issue as the laptop does not come with a blu-ray drive.
this is pretty typical of laptops in this class and battery size.
it does not use a dedicated graphics and instead relies on the new intel hd graphics 3000 that are built into the new intel processors.
storage features for the msi fr720-002us are pretty typically for its $900 list price but it would be nice to see a bit more.
the partitioning of the drive is also a bit weird with data and os partitions that could have been allocated space a little more logically.
many low cost laptops from the major companies come loaded with a large amount of applications, most of them trialware.
the 640gb capacity hard drive is fairly standard although there are competing models that have 750gb for those that need a bit more space for applications, data or media files.
thanks to its size, a full sized numeric keypad is also included on the keyboard.
this is a big step up from the previous gma graphics especially for those looking to do video encoding work.
in dvd playback testing, this yielded just over two and three quarter hours of running time before going into standby mode.
this is a welcome experience compared to some systems that can take forever to boot because of all the applications not to mention having to sort through them on the start menus.
it comes with a relatively high 1600x900 resolution that supports 720p high definition video but falls short of 1080p.

msi provides a much more streamlined environment on the fr720 with very few applications preinstalled on the system.
it comes equipped with the latest generation intel core i7-2630qm quad core processor.
the trackpad is now centered off the space bar rather than offset like some previous msi laptops.

with a list price of just $900, it is one of the most affordable laptops to feature this combination of processor and memory.
