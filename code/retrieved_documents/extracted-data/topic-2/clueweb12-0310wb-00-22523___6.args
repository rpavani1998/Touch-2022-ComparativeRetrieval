this falls squarely in the middle of the desktop replacement laptops in terms of battery life.
this includes a new external case design that has a sleeker look and profile that the last version.
it does use an ati radeon mobility hd 5470 dedicated graphics with 1gb of memory but series gamers will want to look elsewhere.
while the majority of the inspiron 17r units come with a standard dual layer dvd burner, this $1000 version includes a blu-ray combo drive.
the inspiron 17r comes with a few key applications but without as much bloat as competing systems which clutter the system and performance.
the glossy exterior will quickly pick up fingerprints and smudges but the interior is a bit more resistant albeit still glossy.
it does spin at a more traditional 5400rpm spin rate rather than the faster 7200rpm desktop rate which impacts performance slightly.
in the unit reviewed, a moderate level core i5-450m dual core processor is teamed up with 4gb of ddr3 memory.
the 500gb hard drive is fairly typical of the desktop replacement market now and provides a good amount of space for applications and data.
pros - blu-ray drive - good performance - software installation free of much bloatware cons - exterior shows lots of fingerprints and smudges - display can't handle 1080p hd video - 3d graphics best suited for casual gaming description - intel core i5-450m dual core mobile processor - 4gb pc3-8500 ddr3 - 500gb 5400rpm sata hard drive - blu-ray reader and dual layer dvd burner combo drive - 17.3" wsxga+ (1600x900)
it is sufficient for handling all hd video streaming and casual pc gaming but will likely have to play 3d games below the panel's full resolution.lt;/p> to keep the profile slimmer on the inspiron 17r, dell ships most with a standard 6-cell battery pack.
it will fall short of higher end core i5 and core i7 processors but most people probably won't see the difference unless they do video editing or similar heavy computing tasks.
one nice aspect of dell's latest computers is the limited amount of software installed on them.
the 17.3-inch panel uses a 1600x900 resolution that falls short of providing full 1080p hd video support.
this allows the system to be used as a mobile high definition blu-ray player or for playback and recording of cd and dvd media.
at $1000, there are less expensive blu-ray equipped systems or models with better graphics for gaming.
in my dvd playback tests, this resulted in under three hours before going into standby mode.
the panel does use an led backlight that provides a good level of color but a tad bit more subdued in brightness.

powering the inspiron 17r is the new intel 2010 core mobile processors.
it uses a standard glossy coating like most laptops do now that can be prone to glare and reflections in certain lighting conditions.
this provides for a very smooth overall experience in most computing tasks.
