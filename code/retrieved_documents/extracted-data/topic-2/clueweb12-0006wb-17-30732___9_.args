this gives the system a bit of a performance boost that is especially beneficial for those looking to use it for media editing as well as playback.it still falters when compared to the quad core core i7 when it comes to more demanding tasks such as video work but should be sufficient for the average consumer.it still features a decently sized 640gb hard drive that offers a fair amount of space for applications, data and media files.while it is certainly affordable for a sony laptop with a $800 price tag, there are just too many alternatives at this price point for other 17-inch laptops that just have a better mix of features for a variety of different users.gateway's nv75s17u is more affordable, offers more memory and ram and has better integrated graphics but no blu-ray drive.while it is nice that it can boost performance of encoding video with quicksync enabled applications, it still lacks any real 3d performance for even casual pc gaming.blu-ray playback is a bit more demanding and will result in shorter running times.overall, each of these options is just a bit better than sony's depending upon the needs of the consumer.once again, a media focused laptop that is based around the blu-ray format can't display 1080p high definition video without using the external hdmi connector with a monitor.there is a blu-ray compatible drive which is useful for watching the high definition movie format on the go.they still do offer bluetooth which is nice but becoming more common for lower cost laptops such as this.it is a bit smaller than some others on the market but it does come with dedicated right and left mouse buttons that are larger and much easier to use than the single thin rocker bars on many consumer laptops.overall, the design works well, is quite comfortable and accurate to use.it does spin at the slower 5400rpm spin rate still which means it isn't quite as fast as the 7200rpm based laptops or newer ones with solid state and hybrid drives.the drive also supports playback and recording of cd or dvd media.
