while these don't take up much of the storage space compared to the days when hard drives were much smaller, they still can adversely affect the overall performance of the system particularly when a system boots up.performance wise, it falls well behind the intel quad core mobile processors for demanding tasks but it does quite well with general purpose tasks and those that want to multitask average productivity programs.this makes it a good option for those that want an affordable laptop with a large display.this allows the laptop to be used as a mobile blu-ray movie player either via the laptop itself or attached to an hdtv via the hdmi port.storage space for applications, data and media files is also quite good thanks to a decently sized 640gb hard drive that is still the size found in most laptops almost twice its price.it does spin at the more traditional 5400rpm rate which gives it modest performance compared to those that use 7200rpm drives.it achieves this by opting to use the amd fusion platform that consolidates features into fewer parts to keep overall costs down.this includes a display that won't do full hd video resolutions and peripheral ports that will limit the effectiveness of external expansion.in terms of a budget 17-inch system, it has some good points to it including a quad core processor, improved integrated graphics and a blu-ray compatible drive.the drive can also handle playback and recording of dvd and cd media.batteries can also be very expensive for manufacturers to put into a laptop.for one, it has full direct x 11 support and better overall 3d performance but you still wouldn't want to use it for more than casual pc gaming at lower resolutions and detail levels.the resolution is decent for its price at 1600x900 but it is disappointing that it can't reach a full 1080p high definition resolution for supporting blu-ray movies as best as it can.blu-ray playback will yield around two hours as it is more demanding.for one, it has full direct x 11 support and better overall 3d performance
