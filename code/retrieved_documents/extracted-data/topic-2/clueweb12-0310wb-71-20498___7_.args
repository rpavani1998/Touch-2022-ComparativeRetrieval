in this case, it comes with an intel core i7-2630qm quad core processor that offers a high level of performance for those looking to do some serious computing including desktop video work.in addition to this, they support 6gb of ddr3 memory that allows it to run smoothly through most applications or when multitasking.this is a modest 3d graphics processor that can be used for casual gaming at lower resolutions and detail levels.it uses a hybrid graphics system that will use the intel hd graphics system built into the processor when the dedicated graphics is not required in order to conserve battery power.this seems to be the new standard for those laptops that want to have a lot of space for applications, data and media files.the 17.3-inch display offers a fairly typical 1600x900 resolution found in many laptops of this size.it doesn't have the same level of quality as the envy series but is a step up from the traditional plastics found in most consumer laptops.the drive also has the ability to playback or record to cd and dvd media.colors and viewing angles are pretty typical and the glossy display does make it difficult to use outside.in addition to this, hp also includes a blu-ray compatible drive that allows the system to playback high definition blu-ray movies.while the past model used a unified button design, this one returns to the traditional right and left mouse button which greatly increases the accuracy of clicking.one other feature that laptop has is the ability to use a widi compatible box to stream the display to an external hdtv or monitor.this is even higher than apple's macbook pro that claims upwards of seven hours running time.while most consumer laptops come equipped with a six-cell battery pack, hp is packing a nine-cell battery with a surprisingly high 100whr rating.blu-ray playback will likely yield a little more than three while more traditional usage should yield over five hours.
