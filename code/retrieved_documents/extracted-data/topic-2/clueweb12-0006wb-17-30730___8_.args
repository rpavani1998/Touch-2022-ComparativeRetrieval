while it provides a good amount of space for applications, data and media files, the performance is a bit underwhelming due to the traditional 5400rpm spin rate.still, the system does have some better aspects including some good customization options that can boost general performance without costing much and it offers a better range of high speed external peripheral ports.with its base price tag just over $1100, it certainly is much more affordable than many dedicated gaming laptops but it does sacrifice some performance to achieve this.like most laptops now, it comes with a glossy coating which can help increase the contrast but has the tendency to produce glare in certain lighting particularly in bight outdoor lighting.solid state drives are also available but they will heavily restrict the storage space or cost a lot more.most notable, the graphics processor can't quite handle the full 1920x1080 resolution of the display and the smaller battery pack limits unplugged gaming time.this is beneficial for those wanting to use only the integrated graphics to try and extend the battery life.this is a good overall choice for performance that does a very good job at gaming or even dealing with demanding non-gaming tasks like desktop video.the company offers a wide range of customization options most of which will add features but will also add to the cost of the laptop.one nice aspect of the system is the inclusion of 8gb of ddr3 memory that provide it with a very smooth overall experience in windows and is nice to see over the 6gb many companies are providing at this price range.the laptop features a 17.3-inch display panel with a 1920x1080 resolution for full 1080p high definition video support.this can allow the user to disable the auto switching and have it be fixed into a certain mode.in order to keep the weight of this gaming laptop below seven pounds, it uses a smaller six-cell battery pack that features a 48.8 whr capacity rating.a standard dual layer dvd burner handles playback or recording of cd and dvd media.now, the actual running time if the system is used for gaming is going to be below two hours as that is extremely power demanding.
