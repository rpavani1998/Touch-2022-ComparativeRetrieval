it comes with a spacious 750gb hard drive that provides plenty of space for applications, data and media files.this certainly provides good performance for most cases but those wanting to do desktop video would be better served by a quad core i7 processor.the drive also has the capability to read or record to dvd and cd media as well.it can do 3d gaming with direct x 10 support but at much lower resolutions and detail levels than the 17-inch panel can support.continuing with the more budget theme, the processor is matched up with 4gb of ddr3 memory which lets it run smoothly but 8gb would be a better overall room for growth.there is a lot of wasted space around the keyboard that could have been used for larger keys making it more comfortable to use for those with large fingers.this puts it about average for a laptop with these features and price.it uses the isolated style that the company has been using for some time and it works quite well.the drive does spin at a more modest 5400rpm rate but this is fairly typical for this price range.it features a 1600x900 resolution that falls short of full 1080p hd video support for the blu-ray drive but it does offer a fairly typical resolution for this size.while the asus k73e-xa1 uses a six-cell battery pack, it has a slightly higher 5200ma rated capacity.the keyboard design of the asus k73e overall is pretty good but could use a bit of improvement.in dvd playback tests, the laptop will run roughly two and three quarter hours before going into standby mode.those hoping to connect some high speed external storage will be disappointed that it does not come with usb 3.0 or esata ports at all.storage features for the asus k73e-xa1 are actually quite good for a laptop of this price range.
