the display for the asus k73e is the same that was used in the previous k72 series.
storage features for the asus k73e-xa1 are actually quite good for a laptop  of this price range.
this puts it about average for a laptop with these features and price.
this is clearly evident as the current high end model k73e-xa1 uses a middle classed intel core i5-2410m dual core processor.

those hoping to connect some high speed external storage will be disappointed that it does not come with usb 3.0 or esata ports at all.
it can do 3d gaming with direct x 10 support but at much lower  resolutions and detail levels than the 17-inch panel can support.
they even manage to put a full size numeric keypad in with it.
it comes with a spacious 750gb hard drive that provides  plenty of space for applications, data and media files.

the keyboard design of the asus k73e overall is pretty good but could use a bit of improvement.
this certainly provides good performance for most cases but those wanting to do desktop video would be better served by a quad core i7 processor.
in dvd playback tests, the laptop will run roughly two and three quarter hours before going into standby mode.
the trackpad is spacious and  this time around features individual right and left buttons rather than the  rocker bar design.
