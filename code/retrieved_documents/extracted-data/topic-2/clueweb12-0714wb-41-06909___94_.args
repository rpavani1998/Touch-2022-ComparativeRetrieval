it made their os flexible, scalable and more open to community involvement.though a desktop is largely perceived as an appliance - it's an utilitarian box that you use to do stuff with - a laptop has the additional function of being a status symbol and expression of personal taste.this made them profitable and restored people's trust in apple producing a reliable, desirable product.that probably represents just 15% of the market but it's an important 15% and giving those people better tools to do what they do is going to be beneficial for everyone.their it department is top notch and tracks the students' activities thoroughly.now that the laptop market has become so important, apple is in a great position to capitalize on their previously under-exploited brand identity.there is an inperceivable performance difference between macbook pros and desktop computers, which makes the choice (as a mac users) to buy a laptop a no-brainer, whereas a pc user is more used to expecting a mobile computer to have serious performance issues compared to equiso overall, we have not seen any reduction in quality over the past few years, no increase in maintenance costs, and they are very reliable units.in addition to that, they have hit the sweetest spots on both desktop and laptop markets with their high-end intel based hardware.macs, if you use them heavily, need regular maintenance to keep them running smoothly.i currently have three of them assigned to me that i use daily as well (a t60 at home, a x32 for utility work and testing in the server room, and a t43 at my desk which is about to go back on lease which i will replace with a t61) overall, the quality on these laptops is outstanding and they are very durable and very stable.the application menu constrained to the top of the screen hides information present in other applications and forces the user to either learn all the shortcut keys or suffer rediculous amounts of additional mouse travel.i think a lot of people are discovering that os x just works, and doesnt need the sort of tinkering and maintenance that windows rigs generally do to stay in top running shape.there are also a lot of tools available in the command-line environment, as well as open source software that can be compiled for mac os x.pair that up with the fact that their design team is solid and is producing exceptional quality designs such as the ipod line and the iphone.
