this lets the  system power though just about any application that can be thrown at it  including processor intensive desktop video work or pc gaming.
graphics on the hp pavilion dv7-4080us have been upgraded thanks to the use of the ati radeon mobility hd 5650 graphics processor.
the biggest downside is the display panel that doesn't reach full 1080p resolutions but with a $1300 price tag that is a sacrifice many will accept.
the nine cell battery has helped push it to be slightly better than  average.
the new brushed aluminum exterior gives it a nicer feel but it is the terabyte of storage space, blu-ray drive and improved ati graphics that make this system a good choice for just about any type of pc using.

graphics on the hp pavilion dv7-4080us have been upgraded thanks to the use  of the ati radeon mobility hd 5650 graphics processor.
it is certainly a step up from the plastic employed by the majority of laptop manufacturers but it does fall short of hp's envy line or apple's macbook pro's.
rather than using a single drive, hp has packed in two 500gb hard drives to provide just under one terabyte of storage space.
it is possible to find the system for just under $1300 which is a good deal less than what many other companies are charging for a similar set of features.
