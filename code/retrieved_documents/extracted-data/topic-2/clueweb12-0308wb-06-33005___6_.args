it offers decent performance, improved battery life and some unique features to help let the laptop have a long lifespan, but there are too many features missing for its base price tag.consumers can find alternatives that are smaller, more affordable and have additional features.the 4gb of memory is standard of most laptops and helps it run things smoothly.performance is strong with the system thanks to the higher clock speed intel core i7-620m dual core processor.another unique feature to the laptop is a dust filter on the bottom of the laptop that can help extend the life of the laptop provided users remember to periodically clean it.sure it can playback and record cds or dvds but missing out on playing hd movies on the go even though many similarly priced laptops are now offering this.it does not support direct x 11 graphics and is better suited for hd media and casual pc gaming.even though it uses a large 18.4-inch display, it is one of the lightest laptops to use such a display.thanks to the large size of the laptop, it comes with a full sized keyboard that includes a numeric keypad.it isn't as high capacity as some but does give it a bit more running time than most.but it spins at the more sedate 5400rpm rate that does impact performance compared to others than use 7200rpm.in dvd playback tests, it yield just over two hours of running time before going into standby mode.in addition, the color and brightness just aren't as good as some of the other laptops out there.one nice aspect of display though is an anti-glare coating that does help reduce glare and reflections.some older games will run smoothly at the maximum resolution but most will require reduced settings.
