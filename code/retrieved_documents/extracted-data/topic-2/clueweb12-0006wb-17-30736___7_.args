this combined with 6gb of ddr3 memory allows the system to power through some of the most demanding applications including desktop video editing.with a list price of just $900, it is one of the most affordable laptops to feature this combination of processor and memory.it has the ability to playback and record cd or dvd media but that is typical of any laptop that comes with an optical drive.the 640gb capacity hard drive is fairly standard although there are competing models that have 750gb for those that need a bit more space for applications, data or media files.the keyboard on the msi fr720 uses an isolated or chiclet style keyboard that provides a comfortable and accurate experience.brightness and color are acceptable and the viewing angles are fairly narrow especially on the vertical angles.many low cost laptops from the major companies come loaded with a large amount of applications, most of them trialware.the problems is that the 3d performance is still severely limited to just basic 3d gaming at low resolution and detail levels with just direct x 10 support.it comes with a relatively high 1600x900 resolution that supports 720p high definition video but falls short of 1080p.at least msi has included two of the new usb 3.0 ports for high speed external storage if you need additional storage space.it comes equipped with the latest generation intel core i7-2630qm quad core processor.msi provides a much more streamlined environment on the fr720 with very few applications preinstalled on the system.this is a welcome experience compared to some systems that can take forever to boot because of all the applications not to mention having to sort through them on the start menus.thanks to its size, a full sized numeric keypad is also included on the keyboard.in particular, a blu-ray compatible drive would be a nice step up from the base included dual-layer dvd burner.
