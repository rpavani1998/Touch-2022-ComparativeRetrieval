knowing how to take care of your batteries prolongs service life, improves reliability of portable equipment and saves money.self definable power schemes give full control over power control features and allow easy and automatic switching between performance or power saving settings for each hardware component.although there are some caveats, linux is a better choice for mobile computer devices than most other operating systems, because it supports numerous installation methods, works in many heterogeneous environments and needs smaller resources.it saves battery and lowers temperature, without affecting the performance of interactive applications.active matrix displays have better color and contrast, but usually cost more and use more power.the itsy prototype offered considerably more computing power and memory than other pdas of its time, enabling demanding applications such as speech recognition.it has been reported to cause a significant improvement in battery life (for usage patterns that allow it).almost all gsm phones can send and receive sms messages, so this is a way to serve many more clients than just those using a new wap phone.it's fast, generally efficient, and is a good choice on memory or cpu constrained machines.the objective is to reduce hard disk usage to minimum, because on most laptops it is the primary source of noise and energy consumption.compared to the pentium-4 mobile cpu, the pentium-m will allow a smaller form factor for laptops, making them more portable and lighter.it makes mobile internet usage on laptops fairly inexpensive.therefore from the ecological point of view it is better to buy an old computer that didn't need the energy for a new production and which consumes less electricity while it is being used.a bigger screen weighs more, costs more, and is harder to carry, but is good for a portable desktop replacement.it is perfect for laptops and workstations that need to run quietly with low power consumption, or switch to full performance mode if needed.
