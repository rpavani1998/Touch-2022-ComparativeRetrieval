this provides roughly double what most desktop replacements in its price range provide giving more than enough space for programs, data and media files.the new brushed aluminum exterior gives it a nicer feel but it is the terabyte of storage space, blu-ray drive and improved ati graphics that make this system a good choice for just about any type of pc using.this lets the system power though just about any application that can be thrown at it including processor intensive desktop video work or pc gaming.the drives also spin at the faster 7200rpm desktop rate for quick data access.with all the space and performance, it doesn't slow things down much but it does still take up drive space and leave random shortcuts.like its previous version, it comes equipped with a quad core intel core i7-720qm mobile processor paired up with 6gb of ddr3 memory.in addition to this, hp continues to include a blu-ray combo drive that can playback blu-ray movies or be used to playback and record cds and dvds.storage is what really sets the hp pavilion apart from other desktop replacement laptops.most notable of these is the new brushed aluminum exterior that gives the system a new look and feel.the biggest downside is the display panel that doesn't reach full 1080p resolutions but with a $1300 price tag that is a sacrifice many will accept.this gives the new version full direct x 11 capabilities for improved 3d graphics in modern games.rather than using a single drive, hp has packed in two 500gb hard drives to provide just under one terabyte of storage space.it is possible to find the system for just under $1300 which is a good deal less than what many other companies are charging for a similar set of features.more traditional laptop usage adds about an extra hour which is above most system but still well short of apple's macbook pro 17.at least the new graphics can support the panel's resolution better than the previous version.
