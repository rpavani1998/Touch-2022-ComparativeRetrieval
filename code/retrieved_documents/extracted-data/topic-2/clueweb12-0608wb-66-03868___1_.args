the desktop user may have a limited budget but will have the ability to continually upgrade the desktop over time to continue to preserve its longevity and life in an increasingly growing industry.desktop computers are the ultimate powerhouse, out perform laptops and are much cheaper with the ability to upgrade making them less obsolete and preserving your investment longer.the user for a laptop should be purchasing the laptop because they want to carry it around with them and be mobile with their computing.laptop computers are portable, have the “virtual” no cord image and can travel with you.they are becoming very light, increasingly more powerful and have better features as the days go on.they should not care too much about battery life and be willing to spend more money to purchase less.a desktop user should be looking for a more high end type of computer but lack of portability.i am not sure if laptops are just replacing desktops and if i should just not waste my money on a desktop or if they are still better computers.homeforumscontact hijackthissearchhelpplease visit our forums for help with malware removal or any tech support question.laptop rss feed for comments on this post name (required) e-mail (required, never displayed)
