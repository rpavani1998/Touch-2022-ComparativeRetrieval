before we can begin we have to be explicit about how the complexity of a sentence is to be measured: word count, verb count, character count, parse-tree depth, etc.
decorate-sort-undecorate in chapter 4 we saw how to sort a list of items according to some property of the list.
now, as we saw above, python provides a built-in function sort() that performs this task efficiently.
the stack keeps track of this level of nesting, exploiting the fact that the item at the top of the stack is actually shared with a more deeply nested item.
here we will generate a grid of letters, containing words found in the dictionary.
here's how queues can be implemented using lists.
as we will see insection 8.6, the space of possible parse trees is very large; a parser can be thought of as providing a relatively efficient way to find the right solution(s) within a very large space of candidates.
we could use a queue of length n to create all the n-grams of a text.
although the program in example 4.2 is a useful illustration of stacks, it is overkill because we could have done a direct count:phrase.count('(')
this class is derived from python's built-in list class, permitting us to use standard list operations to access the children of a tree node.
we will seldom have to deal with stacks explicitly, as the implementation of nltk parsers, treebank corpus readers, (and even python functions), all use stacks behind the scenes.
a return statement can be used to pass multiple values back to the calling program, by packing them into a tuple.
with appropriate support on your terminal, the escaped text string inside the element above will be rendered as the following string of ideographs: 甚至猫以人贵.

this method was for accessing a child node.
hill-climbing search starting from a given location in the search space, evaluate nearby locations and move to a new location only if it is an improvement on the current location.
to illustrate the difference in efficiency, we will create a list of 1000 numbers, randomize the list, then sort it, counting the number of list manipulations required.
however, it is important to understand what stacks are and how they work.
arecursive descent parser performs backtracking search, applying grammar productions in turn until a match with the next input word is found, and backtracking when there is no match.
[write version with two separate functions] 4.5   algorithm design an algorithm is a "recipe" for solving a problem.
>>>queue.pop(0) 'the' >>> queue.pop(0) 'cat' >>> queue['sat', 'on', 'the', 'branch'] note the list-based implementation of queues is inefficient for large queues.
as with stacks, we will seldom have to deal with queues explicitly, as the implementation of nltk n-gram taggers (section 5.5) and chart parsers use queues behind the scenes.
queue['sat', 'on', 'the', 'branch'] note the list-based implementation of queues is inefficient for large queues.
[write version with two separate functions] an algorithm is a "recipe" for solving a problem.
this approach has a further benefit: it makes it more likely that the function will only return a single type.
the loop pushes material onto the stack when it gets an open parenthesis, and pops the stack when it gets a close parenthesis.
we can also read in the contents of an xml file using the etree package (at least, if the file is encoded as utf-8 — as of writing, there seems to be a problem reading gb2312-encoded files inetree).
observe that this output contains redundant information; each word and its reverse is included.
starting from a given location in the search space, evaluate nearby locations and move to a new location only if it is an improvement on the current location.
an important data type in language processing is the syntactic tree.
koai find words which, when reversed, make legal words.
the comparison function says that we compare two times of the form ('mar', '2004') by reversing the order of the month and year, and converting the month into a number to get('2004', '3'), then using python's built-in cmp function to compare them.
as another example of search, suppose we want to find the most complex sentence in a text corpus.
before we can begin we have to be explicit about how the complexity of a sentence is to be measured: word count, verb count, character count, parse-tree depth, etc.
the outer loop will iterate over each token in the list, while the inner loop will iterate over each character of a string.
this class is derived from python's built-in list class, permitting us to use standard list operations to access the children of a tree node.

this approach has a further benefit: it makes it more likely that the function will only return a single type.
we can compare its performance by timing how long it takes to execute it a million times.
a return statement can be used to pass multiple values back to the calling program, by packing them into a tuple.
list(vowels)]['sequoia'] indexing fuzzy spelling many nlp tasks can be construed as search problems.

in this section we show you how to create simple data classes and processing classes by example.

we can also read in the contents of an xml file using the etree package (at least, if the file is encoded as utf-8 — as of writing, there seems to be a problem reading gb2312-encoded files inetree).
however, we can use stacks for more sophisticated processing of strings containing nested structure, as shown inexample 4.3.
for example, the task of a parser is to identify one or more parse trees for a given sentence.
here we will generate a grid of letters, containing words found in the dictionary.
here's how queues can be implemented using lists.
in such cases, it is better to use python's built-in support for "double-ended queues",collections.deque.
in chapter 4 we saw how to sort a list of items according to some property of the list.
now we can try a simple sort method called bubble sort, that scans through the list many times, exchanging adjacent items if they are out of order.
as we will see insection 8.6, the space of possible parse trees is very large; a parser can be thought of as providing a relatively efficient way to find the right solution(s) within a very large space of candidates.
the program inexample 4.2 processes a sentence with phrase markers, and checks that the parentheses are balanced.

we can try the same task using various sorting algorithms.

however, we can use stacks for more sophisticated processing of strings containing nested structure, as shown inexample 4.3.
we can use lists to implement so-called abstract data types such as stacks and queues.
the __repr__() function produces a string representation of the object, one that can be executed to re-create the object, and is accessed from the interpreter simply by typing the name of the object and pressing 'enter'.
for example, the task of a parser is to identify one or more parse trees for a given sentence.
the loop pushes material onto the stack when it gets an open parenthesis, and pops the stack when it gets a close parenthesis.

evidently merge sort is much better than bubble sort, and quicksort is better still.
in such cases, it is better to use python's built-in support for "double-ended queues",collections.deque.
