the methods to sort data are as varied as there are ways to visualize it, each algorithm and its implementation is crafted with an artistic touch.algorithms are used for calculation, data processing, and automated reasoning.sha-1 is a more recent standard for secure cryptography but is susceptible to other known vulnerabilities (is nothing sacred).(source) understanding strategies beats memorizing tactics algorithms are well specified techniques for performing an unbounded variety of tasks (good luck learning all algorithms).the algorithms average and worst case performance is o(n^2) heapsort the heapsort finds an extreme element (largest or smallest) and places it at one end of the list, continuing until the entire list is sorted.much of my sophomoric understanding of computer science comes from iterative practice, reading, and communicating with folks much smarter than myself.merge sort the merge sort implements a divide and conquer strategy.heapsort begins by building a heap out of the data set, and then removing the largest item and placing it at the end of the partially sorted array.the heapsort finds an extreme element (largest or smallest) and places it at one end of the list, continuing until the entire list is sorted.they are the tactics employed by computer scientists day in and day out, many times without even conscious awareness until further optimization is needed.the mht associates combinations of measurements (factorial growth), calculates likelihood scores, and retains a set number of associations per iteration.after removing the largest item, it reconstructs the heap, removes the largest remaining item, and places it in the next open position from the end of the partially sorted array.the merge sort has an average and worst case performance of o(nlogn).sorting algorithms i blame the cruel mistress entropy for the heroic efforts needed to repeatedly sort unorganized data, such is nature.2) reorder the list so that all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot, while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it (equal values can go either way).
