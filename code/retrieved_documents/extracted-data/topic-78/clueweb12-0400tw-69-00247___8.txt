on the other hand, it is obvious that by comparing items that lie apart the  list can’t be sorted in one pass like insertion sort.
well, as insertion sort and bubble sort, shell sort is not very effective  compared to quicksort or merge sort.

insertion sort compares every single item with all the rest elements of the list in order to find its place, while shell sort compares items that lie far apart.
$gap; $i = $gap && $arr[$j - $gap] > $temp) { $arr[$j] = $arr[$j  - $gap]; $j -= $gap; } $arr[$j] = $temp; } $gap = array_pop($gaps); } return  $arr; } // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 shell_sort($input); it’s easy to change this code in order to work with shell  sequence.
insertion sort compares every single item with all the rest elements  of the list in order to find its place, while shell sort compares items that  lie far apart.
however it is intuitively clear that shell sort may need even more  comparisons than insertion sort.
that is why in 1959donald shell proposed an algorithm that tries to overcome this problem by comparing items of the list that lie far apart.
the best approach is the knuth sequence where the complexity is o(n3/2), as you can see on the diagram bellow.
this means light elements move faster to the front of the list.
with shell sort, once the list is sorted for gap =
that is why on each pass we should use a fixed gap between the items, then decrease the value on every consecutive iteration.

array(6, 5, 3, 1, 8, 7, 2, 4); function shell_sort($arr) { $len = count($arr); $gap = floor($len/2); while($gap > 0) { for($i = $gap;
$i = $gap && $arr[$j - $gap] > $temp) { $arr[$j] = $arr[$j - $gap]; $j -= $gap; } $arr[$j] = $temp; } $gap = floor($gap/2); } return $arr; } // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 shell_sort($input); yet again we can’t determine the exact complexity of this algorithm, because it depends on the gap sequence.

the thing is that insertion sort is not an effective sorting algorithm at all, but in some cases, when the list is almost sorted it can be quite useful.
perhaps the main advantage of shell sort is that the list can be sorted for a gap greater than 1 and thus making less exchanges than insertion sort.

we start to compare items with a fixed gap, that becomes lesser on  each iteration until it gets to 1.

the good thing is that it is quite easy to  implement (not easier than insertion sort), but in general it should be avoided  for large data sets.
for the shell’s sequence the complexity is o(n2), while for the pratt’s sequence it is o(n*log2(n)).
