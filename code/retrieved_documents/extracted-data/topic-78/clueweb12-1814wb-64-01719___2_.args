a quicksort is generally considered to be faster than a merge sort but isn't stable and doesn't guarantee n log(n)performance.a quicksort is generally considered to be faster than a merge sort but isn't stable and doesn't guaranteen log(n) performance.the sort operation uses a slightly optimized merge sort algorithmwhich is fast and stable: fast: it is guaranteed to run in n log(n) time and runs substantially faster on nearly sorted lists.empirical tests showed it to be as fast as a highly optimized quicksort.the sortoperation uses a slightly optimized merge sort algorithmwhich is fast and stable: the followingthe following - fast: it is guaranteed to run in n log(n)time and runs substantially faster on nearly sorted lists.if a user of a mail program sorts the inbox by mailing date and then sorts it by sender, the user naturally expects that the now-contiguous list of messages from a given sender will (still) be sorted by mailing date.the sort algorithm can be used to sort thelist prior to calling binarysearch.the program was included only to show you that algorithms really are as easy to use as they appear to be.[i, line, the, walk] the second form of sorttakes a comparatorin addition to a listand sorts the elements with the comparator.then the code sorts thislist, using a comparator that expectslist instances, and implements reverse size-ordering.then the code sorts this list, using a comparatorthat expects listinstances, and implements reverse size-ordering.[i, line, the, walk] the program was included only to show you that algorithms really are as easy to use as they appear to be.for example, it could be used to shuffle alist of card objects representing a deck.for example, it could be used to shuffle a listof cardobjects representing a deck.finally, the code iterates through the sorted list, printing its elements (the anagram groups).finally, the code iterates through the sortedlist, printing its elements (the anagram groups).
