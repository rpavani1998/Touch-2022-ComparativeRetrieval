it is much less efficient on large lists than the more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort, but it has various advantages: simple to implement efficient on (quite) small data sets efficient on data sets which are already substantially sorted more efficient in practice than most other simple o(n2) algorithms such as selection sort or bubble sort stable (does not change the relative order of elements with equal keys)
in each step, the first remaining entry of the input is removed, inserted into the result at the right position.
in other words, call the perl you will want from a web browser.

no comments » 13th january 2006 - by paradochs quicksort is a well-known sorting algorithm developed by c. a. r. hoare that, on average, makes o(n log n) comparisons to sort n items.
by paradochs this code implements and runs the sort algorithm code in other sort articles found here.
to perform insertion sort, start at the left end of the array and invoke insert to insert each element encountered into its correct position.
typically, quicksort is significantly faster in practice than other o(n log n) algorithms, because its inner loop can be efficiently implemented on most architectures, and in most real-world data it is possible to make design choices which minimize the possibility of requiring quadratic time.
the result array after k iterations contains the first k entries of the input array and is sorted.

it is an online algorithm, in that it can sort a list as it receives it.
if http://www.yoursite.com/cgi-bin/helloworld.pl works right, then you’re set.
quicksort sorts by employing a divide and conquer strategy to divide a list into two sub-lists.
in each step, the first remaining entry of the input is removed, inserted into the result at the right position.
first off, you need to have your web server correctly serving the perl as is.
