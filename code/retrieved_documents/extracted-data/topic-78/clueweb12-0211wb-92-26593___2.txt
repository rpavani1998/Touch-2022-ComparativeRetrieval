- in bucket sort, we build a set of buckets that correspond to the range of elements.
in each round, we spend o(n) time taking stuff out of the vector (assuming that we can append to each bucket in constant time) and o(m+n) time putting stuff back into the vector.
if there are two elements that were never compared, they may not be in the correct place.
- what is the extra space requirement? o(m).

well, there are o(l) rounds, where l is the  number of positions in the sequences.
we'll leave that question to the future.
after each partition, we glue the partitions back together, smallest to largest.
we then step through our array, copying or  moving each element to the appropriate bucket.

if you are restricted to compare and swap, it turns out that you can't do better than n*log_2(n) steps.

if we know that the elements in our array are in a restricted range, we  can do a sort that array without comparing and swapping, if we're willing to  use some extra space.

a careful analysis will show you that if  you use fewer steps, you won't have been able to compare each element to every  other element (directly or indirectly).
some are o(n*n) one (merge sort) is o(n*log_2(n)), but requires significantly extra space.

why is this an unsatisfying algorithm?

(in the extreme case, we only use two buckets in each sort or subsort, giving us something close to quick sort.)

e.g., if a precedes b after the first partitioning, and a and b end up in the same group in the second partitioning, then a must precede b in its group.
- in radix sort, one repeatedly partitions the objects based on one of the elements of the sequence, moving from least significant to most significant element of the sequence.
- however, we can often call l and m constants (e.g., for integers, l is always 32 and m is always 2), so that's a running time of o(n).

other sorting algorithms
in bucket sort, we build a set of buckets that  correspond to the range of elements.
if each object to be sorted can be represented as a sequence of values (e.g., a sequence of digits in a decimal number, a sequence of characters in words, a sequence of bits in the binary representation of the object) and sorting can be based on that sequence, then it is possible to sort based on those sequences.
