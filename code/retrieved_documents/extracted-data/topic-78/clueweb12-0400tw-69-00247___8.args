on the other hand, it is obvious that by comparing items that lie apart the list can’t be sorted in one pass like insertion sort.
well, as insertion sort and bubble sort, shell sort is not very effective compared to quicksort or merge sort.
insertion sort compares every single item with all the rest elements of the list in order to find its place, while shell sort compares items that lie far apart.
insertion sort compares every single item with all the rest elements of the list in order to find its place, while shell sort compares items that lie far apart.
however it is intuitively clear that shell sort may need even more comparisons than insertion sort.
this means light elements move faster to the front of the list.

the thing is that insertion sort is not an effective sorting algorithm at all, but in some cases, when the list is almost sorted it can be quite useful.
perhaps the main advantage of shell sort is that the list can be sorted for a gap greater than 1 and thus making less exchanges than insertion sort.
experience all that the html5 microzone has to offer on our homepage and check out the cutting edge web development tutorials on script junkie, build my pinned site, and the html5 devcenter.

more this section is brought to you in partnership with: insertion sort is a great algorithm, because it’s very intuitive and it is easy to implement, but the problem is that it makes many exchanges for each “light” element in order to put it on the right place.
the good thing is that it is quite easy to implement (not easier than insertion sort), but in general it should be avoided for large data sets.

thus “light” elements at the end of the list may slow down the performance of insertion sort a lot.
