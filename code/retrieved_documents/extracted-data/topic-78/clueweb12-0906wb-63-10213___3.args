however, with a comparison such as { substr($a, 0, 3) cmp substr($b, 0, 3) } stability might matter because elements that compare equal on the first 3 characters may be distinguished based on subsequent characters.
on the other hand, quicksort is often faster for small arrays, and on platforms with small memory caches that are much faster than main memory.
mergesort also takes advantage of pre-existing order, so it would be favored for using sort to merge several sorted arrays.
on average, mergesort does fewer comparisons than quicksort, so it may be better when complicated comparison routines are used.
a stable sort means that for records that compare equal, the original input ordering is preserved.
mergesort also takes advantage of pre-existing order, so it would be favored for using sort to merge several sorted arrays.
you can force the choice of algorithm with this pragma, but this feels heavy-handed, so the subpragmas beginning with a _ may not persist beyond perl 5.8.
that means that simple numerical and lexical sorts do not profit from stability, since equal elements are indistinguishable.
with the sort pragma you can control the behaviour of the builtin sort() function.
in perl 5.8 and later, quicksort can be stabilized, but doing so will add overhead, so it should only be done if it matters.
