there are faster algorithms for some sets of data types quicksort is beautiful because of the elegant idea behind its principles.

but recursion is dangerous sometimes, so an iterative approach is also available.
the problem is that in the worst case it is o(n2) – same as bubble sort.
the thing is that in the worst case quicksort is not so effective and it’s practically as slow as bubble sort and insertion sort.
of course the best pivot is the middle element from the list.
array_push($stack, $left); } return $sorted; } // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 print_r(quicksort_iterative($list)); the complexity of quicksort in the average case is o(n*log(n)) – same as merge sort.

choosing a pivot of course the best pivot is the middle element from the list.
as i said above recursive approach is something very natural for quicksort as it follows the divide and conquer principles.
the good thing is that in practice with randomly generated lists there is not a high possibility to go into the worst case of quicksort.
in fact quicksort is a very elegant general purpose sorting algorithm and every developer should be familiar with its principles.
elegant solution with no tricky merging as merge sort why not using quicksort as slow as bubble sort in the worst case!
quicksort is beautiful because of the elegant idea behind its principles.
indeed if you have two sorted lists one with items with a greater value from a given value and the other with items smaller form that given value you can simply concatenate them and you can be sure that the resulting list will be sorted with no need of special merge.

the problem is that there’s not an easy way to get the middle element from a list and this will slow down the algorithm.
back in 1960 c. a. r. hoare comes with a brilliant sorting algorithm.
the thing is that in the worst case quicksort is not so effective and it’s practically as slow as bubble sort and insertion sort.
first we’ve to choose an element from the list (called a pivot) then we must put all the elements with value less than the pivot on the left side of the pivot and all the items with value greater than the pivot on its right side.
if you do that on each step you’ll practically go into the worst scenario and that is no good.

that is a typical divide and conquer algorithm and it just follows the intuitive approach of speeding up the sorting process by reducing the number of comparisons.

why using quicksort in general its speed is same as merge sort – o(n*log(n))
quicksort posted on march 13, 2012 by stoimen introduction when it comes to sorting items by comparing them merge sort is one very natural approach.
