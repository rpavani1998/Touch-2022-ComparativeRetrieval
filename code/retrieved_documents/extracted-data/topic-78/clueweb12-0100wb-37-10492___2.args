it is very easy to make errors when programming quick sort.
the whole array is scanned at eachlevel of calls, so the total work done is o(n*log(n)).
in this case push thelarger partition on the stack while the smaller section is sorted, because this limits the stack requirements to o(log2(n)).
this occurs when the estimate of the median is systematically always poor, e.g. on already sorted data, but this is very unlikely to happen by chance.

ideally, partitioning would use the median of the given values, but the median can only be found by scanning the whole array and this would slow the algorithm down.
quick sort can be made faster, i.e. its constant of proportionality reduced, by various techniques: use a simpler sort, e.g. insertion sort, when the section of the array to be sorted is "small".
