the thing is that insertion sort is not an effective sorting algorithm at all, but in some cases, when the list is almost sorted it can be quite useful.on the other hand, it is obvious that by comparing items that lie apart the list can’t be sorted in one pass like insertion sort.perhaps the main advantage of shell sort is that the list can be sorted for a gap greater than 1 and thus making less exchanges than insertion sort.more this section is brought to you in partnership with: insertion sort is a great algorithm, because it’s very intuitive and it is easy to implement, but the problem is that it makes many exchanges for each “light” element in order to put it on the right place.insertion sort compares every single item with all the rest elements of the list in order to find its place, while shell sort compares items that lie far apart.the good thing is that it is quite easy to implement (not easier than insertion sort), but in general it should be avoided for large data sets.share it with your friends:| more this section is brought to you in partnership with: insertion sort is a great algorithm, because it’s very intuitive and it is easy to implement, but the problem is that it makes many exchanges for each “light” element in order to put it on the right place.thus “light” elements at the end of the list may slow down the performance of insertion sort a lot.well, as insertion sort and bubble sort, shell sort is not very effective compared to quicksort or merge sort.however it is intuitively clear that shell sort may need even more comparisons than insertion sort.this means light elements move faster to the front of the list.view full user profile algorithm of the week: shell sort february 28, 2012 at 12:01 am tweet the html5 microzone is presented by dzone and microsoft to bring you the most interesting and relevant content on emerging web standards.related posts: source: http://www.stoimen.com/blog/2012/02/27/computer-algorithms-shell-sort/ this section is brought to you in partnership with: programming groovy is easy to start with.complexity of shell sort with different gap sequences.dzone has great portals forpython, cloud, nosql, and html5!
