elegant solution with no tricky merging as merge sort why not using quicksort as slow as bubble sort in the worst case!

it is a pure divide and conquer approach like merge sort, but while merge sort’s tricky part was merging the sorted sub-lists, in quicksort there are other things to consider.

if you have two sorted lists, one with items with a greater value  from a given value and the other with items smaller form that given value, you  can simply concatenate them and you can be sure that the resulting list will be  sorted with no need of special merge.
after choosing a pivot the rest is simple.

it is natural because it simply divides the list into two  equal sub-lists then sorts these two partitions applying the same rule.
so typically we can get for a pivot the first or the last item of the list.
first of all, the best choice for a pivot is the bottleneck.

dzone has great portals forpython, cloud, nosql, and html5!
the good thing is that in practice with  randomly generated lists there is not a high possibility to go into the worst  case of quicksort.
on each step we  divide the list in two and we pass those sub-lists to our recursive function.
after that we must repeat these steps for the left and the right sub-lists.
choosing a pivot of course the best pivot is the middle element from the list, leaving the list divided into two fairly equal sub-lists.
indeed it all  depends on that pivot.
