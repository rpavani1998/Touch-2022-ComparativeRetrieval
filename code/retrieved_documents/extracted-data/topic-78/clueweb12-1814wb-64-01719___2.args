finally, the code iterates through the sortedlist, printing its elements (the anagram groups).
[i, line, the, walk] the program was included only to show you that algorithms really are as easy to use as they appear to be.
for example, it could be used to shuffle a listof cardobjects representing a deck.

the revised printing code iterates through themap's values view, putting every list that passes the minimum-size test into alist of lists.
a quicksort is generally considered to be faster than a merge sort but isn't stable and doesn't guarantee n log(n)performance.
if it is longer, the remaining elements in the destinationlist are unaffected.
the destination listmust be at least as long as the source.
if a user of a mail program sorts the inbox by mailing date and then sorts it by sender, the user naturally expects that the now-contiguous list of messages from a given sender will (still) be sorted by mailing date.
then the code sorts thislist, using a comparator that expectslist instances, and implements reverse size-ordering.

also, it's useful for generating test cases.

for example, it could be used to shuffle alist of card objects representing a deck.
if the list contains the search key, its index is returned.
empirical tests showed it to be as fast as a highly optimized quicksort.
the sortalgorithm can be used to sort the listprior to calling binarysearch.
recall that the anagram groups are stored as values in a map, in the form of listinstances.
the sort operation uses a slightly optimized merge sort algorithmwhich is fast and stable: fast: it is guaranteed to run in n log(n) time and runs substantially faster on nearly sorted lists.
