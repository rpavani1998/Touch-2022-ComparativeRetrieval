it is natural, because simply divides the list into two equal  sub-lists then sort these two partitions applying the same rule.
it is a pure divide and conquer approach as merge sort, but while merge sort’s tricky part was merging the sorted sub-lists, in quicksort there are other things to consider.
there are faster algorithms for some sets of data types quicksort is beautiful because of the elegant idea behind its principles.

application quicksort is a great sorting algorithm and developers often go for it, but  let’s see some pros and cons of it.
== 1) { $sorted[] = $temp[0]; continue; }   $pivot = $temp[0]; $left = $right = array();   for ($i = 1; $i  $temp[$i]) { $left[] = $temp[$i]; } else { $right[] = $temp[$i]; } }   $left[] = $pivot;   if (count($right))

but because recursion can be heavy, there is an  iterative approach.
choosing a pivot of course the best pivot is the middle element from the list.
as i said above recursive approach is something very natural for quicksort as it follows the divide and conquer principles.
← algorithm cheatsheet: quicksort you think you  know php.
first of all obviously the choice of a pivot is the bottleneck.
on each step we divide the  list in two and we pass those sub-lists to our recursive function.
in  general quicksort consists of some very simple steps.
the good thing is that in practice with  randomly generated lists there is not a high possibility to go into the worst  case of quicksort.
so typically we can get for a pivot the first or the last item of the list.
in fact quicksort is a very elegant general purpose sorting algorithm and  every developer should be familiar with its principles.
indeed it  all depends on that pivot.

elegant solution with no tricky merging as merge sort why not using quicksort as slow as bubble sort in the worst case!

quicksort is beautiful because of the elegant idea behind its principles.
thus the list will be divided into two fairly equal sub-lists.
thus the list  will be divided into two fairly equal sub-lists.
typically iterative approaches “model” recursion with extra memory  and a model of a stack, which is our case.
indeed it all depends on that pivot.
indeed if you have two sorted lists one with items with a greater value from a given value and the other with items smaller form that given value you can simply concatenate them and you can be sure that the resulting list will be sorted with no need of special merge.

such an algorithm is quicksort.
recursive quicksort $list = array(5,3,9,8,7,2,4,1,6,5);   // recursive function quicksort ($array) { if (count($array)
the problem is that  there’s not an easy way to get the middle element from a list and this  will slow down the algorithm.
it’s clear that with this algorithm naturally we’re going into  a recursive solution.
back in 1960 c. a. r. hoare comes with a brilliant sorting algorithm.
here we have two examples of  quicksort – recursive and iterative in php.
however there are other “divide and conquer” sorting algorithms that do not follow the merge sort scheme, while they have practically the same success.
the thing is that  in the worst case quicksort is not so effective and it’s practically as  slow as bubble sort and insertion sort.
typically every divide and conquer approach is easy to  implement with recursion.
in general quicksort consists of some very simple steps.
first we’ve to choose an element from the list (called a pivot) then we must put all the elements with value less than the pivot on the left side of the pivot and all the items with value greater than the pivot on its right side.
if you do that on each step you’ll practically go into the worst scenario and that is no good.
$list = array(5,3,9,8,7,2,4,1,6,5); // recursive function quicksort ($array) { if (count($array)

array_push($stack, $right); if (count($left))
the problem is that in the worst case it is o(n2) – same as bubble sort.
== 0) { return array(); } $pivot = $array[0] ; $left =
but we  should consider that in practice we don’t quite use sorted lists that we  have to sort again, right?
$right = array(); for ($i = 1; $i  0) { $temp = array_pop($stack); if ( count($temp) =

let’s go first with the  recursion.
when it comes to sorting items by comparing them merge sort is one very natural approach.
after that we  must repeat these steps for the left and the right sub-lists.
put every item with a greater  value on the right and every item with a lesser value on the left.
that is a typical divide and conquer algorithm and it just follows the intuitive approach of speeding up the sorting process by reducing the number of comparisons.

however there are other “divide and conquer” sorting algorithms  that do not follow the merge sort scheme, while they have practically the same  success.
imagine that you choose the greatest value from the list – than you’ve to put all the other items of the list into the “left” sub-list.

iterative implementation isn’t easy

quicksort – difference between php and javascript computer algorithms: merge sort
indeed if you have two sorted lists one with items with a greater value from a  given value and the other with items smaller form that given value you can  simply concatenate them and you can be sure that the resulting list will be  sorted with no need of special merge.
after choosing a pivot the rest is simple.
