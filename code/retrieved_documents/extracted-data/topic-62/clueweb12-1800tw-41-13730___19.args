we were about 12: harold mcgee looking owlish, heston blumenthal with his arm in a sling, some academics, journalists and prs.
to me, these varied only in their metal-ness – copper tasted more metallic than stainless steel, which tasted more metallic than gold.
as a child i remember the metal cups at school too, but it was the camping trips, all the food and drink had that strong plastic taste from the plates, cups and cutlery 20 april 2012 1:43pm stainless steel isn't the best metal for cutlery, perhaps metal isn't the best material for cutlery at all – though on current evidence i reckon it is.
and the taste of an eating implement does affect the taste of the food.
perhaps stainless steel isn't the best metal for cutlery, perhaps metal isn't the best material for cutlery at all – though on current evidence i reckon it is.
maybe for that reason i enjoyed eating my soup with a wooden spoon at my granny's.
what about a series of columns entitled "consider........" that might be really interesting on a friday afternoon!
it's the perfect antidote for all this rain.

22 april 2012 2:11pmresponse to ambikadevi, 21 april 2012 7:12pm copper, in small amounts, has an anti-bacterial action, it also has excellent heat transfer qualities, so it would be great for holding water (as we know, as we use copper water pipes).
but you have to accept black steel is cheaper and you can season that (as you can cast iron but it is heavy and can break if dropped).
beling somewhat plebian, i am happy to use stainless steel.

i don’t know about gold, i don’t have any.
the gold spoonwas nicer than most of the others: it was neutral and clean and barely tasted metallic.
i'm sure that when the new-fangled plastic ones were introduced, we all went for those first because they didn't affect the taste of the cheap orange squash we were drinking.
to me this dinner, with its tasting notes and the rest, seemed like the dernier cri in shark-jumping foodie bullshit.
plastic medicine spoons also are guilty of being too curvaceous.
well not forks and knives, but spoons.
even blumenthal, who looked thoroughly baffled by proceedings, gamely chipped in by observing "there's a bitterness to the zinc".
"check out the taste profile of silver with beer foam!" raved another.
20 april 2012 5:53pm this experiment was worthless because it wasn't a blind tasting/testing.
12:34pm we had those metal beakers at my primary school too.
even blumenthal, who looked thoroughly baffled by proceedings, gamely chipped in by observing "there's a bitterness to the zinc".
as a child, i was taught that chowing down on your cutlery was rather rude and that in polite company you weren't supposed to chew on your spoons . . .
5:28am stainless steel isn't the best metal for cutlery, perhaps metal isn't the best material for cutlery at all – though on current evidence i reckon it is.
with a decent selection of acidic foods linked in series you could probably get a decent voltage up.
when private eye asks the question, the answer is usually no: the me and my spoon column features spoons because spoons aren't especially interesting.
a friend of mine loves the wooden stick at the end of a lolly, while i hate its splinters and the way it dries your tongue.
when i was a kid, we were taught that it is the height of bad manners to chow down on your cutlery.
it's not so much that i think it tastes different to a stainless steel spoon or a wooden one, more that the low density/heat capacity means that you don't burn your lips/tongue so often 20 april 2012 2:02pm

almost all food preparation will involve a knife, there are two main materials, carbon steel and stainless steel.
or, more specifically, on what spoons are made of, which would be a good name for an inspirational movie about spoons.
i've noticed my elderly mother find deep dessert spoons to much for her now.
they are so tactile and a gorgeous colour.
to me this dinner, with its tasting notes and the rest, seemed like the dernier cri in shark-jumping foodie bullshit.
i can feel my teeth going on edge remembering the weird plastic taste of a kia ora orange in the cinema circa 1969 - the square clear plastic carton and the strangely hard straw.
it broke" my mother wacked my hand once with the wooden spoon and it broke.

20 april 2012 7:27pm the most important thing about spoons is the depth.
then he would wash his hands and transfer his ring back.
given all this i fail to see how the spoon can compete.
an overly concave spoon seems to leave a residue in the bottom so requiring the eater to turn the spoon over in the mouth.
or, more specifically, on what spoons are made of, which would be a good name for an inspirational movie about spoons.
for example most kitchens will be using black steel pans (they aren’t black when new but become black with use).
20 april 2012 5:35pm other restaurants will use untreated aluminium and lots will use aluminium based stainless steel pots like i do - bourgeat is a great brand.
a silver or gold flute would sound great but i'd also be fascinated to try to play the same materials as the spoons are one of my secondary instruments!
no annoying taste with porcelain spoons.
they say caviar should be eaten from bone.
it's the raw immediacy of the metal, the touch of it on your palate, its cold bite on your teeth.
although i can't entirely blame the plates for the dreadful food, the water, served in cups made of the same metal, was truly disgusting.
plastic spoons always taste greasy, and are only good for babies.

finally there are your fillings, if you have the traditional amalgam fillings in your mouth then they contain 50% mercury and descending amounts of silver, tin and copper, plus other trace metals.
and the taste of an eating implement does affect the taste of the food.
once in our local cafe we came across a table of four south africans (not that nationality has anything to do with it) with teaspoons hanging off the ends of their noses -- if you lick a teaspoon of the right bowl dimension it will stick to your nose -- it was hilarious.
however, milk always seemed colder in the metal ones (pre-thatcher, natch).
apart from being the best made, most expensive socks i own, they also do work- in that they stop foot rot and stinky feet, you can wear them for days, which is important if you are going on a hike for a few days or more.
20 april 2012 8:08pmresponse to jamesramsden, 20 april 2012 7:10pm if your teeth are in reasonable condition (and not magic) then they don’t feel anything, except pain.
copper, when used in cooking pots is invariably tinned for the same reasons- copper pots are rare these days as there are better alternatives.
copper, i read with a creeping sense of terror, is "found to slightly inhibit saltiness", silver has "a slight bitterness", zinc carries an "earthly, dry, rasping tendency" while poor old stainless steel was prosaically glossed as "familiar".
a spoon should be like the diver in an olympic event, in to the mouth with minimal splash.
in thailand you can get beautiful teaspoons carved from mango wood.
20 april 2012 2:07pm basil fawlty hit manuel with a spoon, he couldn't have done this with a fork or a knife.
the food at quilon is deliciously spiced and complex: it was impossible to focus on the spoons.
stainless is what the environmental health will recommend and is what i use in the main, i also use anodised aluminium.
your tongue and nose do the tasting, if i smell a silver (plated) spoon i am highly unlikely to notice a difference between that and a stainless steel spoon and as i have explained, eating curry isn’t going to have any effect regardless of what metal you use, somebody’s aftershave would have more effect.
i asked him why and he said this was so that tiny particles of gold would mix into the food over time and enter his system.
it would have to be organized as a blind taste test to determine if the material the cutlery is made of has anything effect on taste.
infact, some ayurvedic medicines are made with fine gold dust and herbs....as for the taste of food....
harold mcgee looking owlish, heston blumenthal with his arm in a sling, some academics, journalists and prs.
the problem with all the other alternatives (and anodised to an extent) is they can’t be given a good scrubbing, with stainless you can take a metal scourer (sp?) to it with impunity.
i really hate tin cutlery.
20 april 2012 1:59pm i have to admit that i often use my titanium 'camping' spoon (due to being lightweight and attachable to things because it has a hole in the handle) when tasting stuff during cooking.
the dinner was organised by something calledthe institute of making, which sounds like a university for toddlers but is in fact "a multidisciplinary research club for those interested in the made world".
"check out the taste profile of silver with beer foam!" raved another.
you could use pyrex or duran pots, ceramic knives (expensive) and chinese ceramic spoons.
the food at quilon is deliciously spiced and complex: it was impossible to focus on the spoons.
" i'm finally convinced that the daily mail was, in fact, right all along and we are all being escorted to hell in a handcart.
i'm pretty sure that when the new fangled palstic ones were introduced, we'd all go for them first, presumably because they didn't affect the taste of the cheap orange squash we were drinking.
much more fun than trying to analyse the taste profile of silver with beer foam.
a friend of mine loves the wooden stick at the end of a lolly, while i hate its splinters and the way it dries your tongue.
12:10pm sometimes i feel guardian articles are explaining too much, often leaving less room for creative thought.
in the gdr, at school, we had aluminium cutlery.
bit dissapointed to not have a column about actual food today, oliver.
my parents have nasty nickel plated cutlery which tastes horrid and finally you can't eat a boiled egg with a metal spoon - must be horn or bone.
to me, these varied only in their metal-ness – copper tasted more metallic than stainless steel, which tasted more metallic than gold.
other restaurants will use untreated aluminium, it has superior heat qualities (although cast iron has better heat retention properties), but isn’t advised by the fsa as it can react with foods and cause a build-up of aluminium in the body (a bad thing).
20 april 2012 4:57pm what i don’t quite understand is why the fascination with the material used in the spoon effecting flavour when the material used in the cooking pot is going to have a much larger effect since it is in contact with the food for much longer.
(she also had real spoons, but on that way it was very stylish.)
stainless steel is non-reactive (but harder to sharpen) while carbon steel is reactive, even slicing a tomato can cause a reaction (it’s easier to keep sharp but holds a blade for a shorter time, hence a straightening steel).
12:34pm i too remember the awful institutional crockery, cups and cutlery at school - they used to make your mouth and teeth tingle and not in a good way!
also if you cook with cast iron (not enamelled) pans like a dutch oven then the food will, variables aside, supply enough trace iron to supply your daily requirements.
makes each meal interesting coz your hands would prob taste different each time.
nothing boring about them at all, try living without them.
silver also has similar properties, i have a pair of hiking socks (well i have two pairs) and they are woven with small amounts of silver.
the gold spoonwas nicer than most of the others: it was neutral and clean and barely tasted metallic.
my grandmom was such a fantastic cook, i never noticed anything else!!!!
20 april 2012 5:09pm incidentally, if my post has frightened anyone, don’t have nightmares.
looking back, in my grandfather's house in south india, water was always served in little copper pots, we ate and drank from pure, solid silver plates and glasses and a very strange thing my grandfather did at every mealtime....he would transfer his big gold wedding ring from his left hand to his right hand while eating.
anyway, i'm a bit disappointed not to have a column about actual food on a friday afternoon oliver.
so yeah, the metal affects taste.
a shallow bowl should render the food easier to slide off with the lips.
as for me, plebian that i am, i am quite happy with stainless steel.
as long as it's dishwasher safe i don't give a stuff.
share comments (…) spoons made from different metals.
