depending on the orchid type, high humidity isn't always necessary, & more orchids die from overwatering than underwatering - particularly those with aerial root systems grown in a bark medium.a few applications of safer insecticidal soap keeps things under control.and as also stated, terracotta orchid pots with the little slits in the sides are best for good drainage & aeration.although i don't know how "organic" it is, i also use a fertilizer specifically meant for orchids.this way you can water your plant, anytime of the day/night.from a google search for peace lily, i gather that they pretty much thrive on neglect?i've never owned either of these plants so i'm needing to learn about their care.the only pest i've ever had a problem with is mealybug, which seems to arrive on every orchid i've purchased or received.but if i were you, i'd consider that these orchids are true tropicals, & ice-cold melting water isn't really optimum.a friend stopped by today and told me she has orchids like mine and waters them by putting three ice cubes on the soil once a week.these plants were given as memorials to my sister so i'm hoping to be able to keep them around.soil kept just moist works best; overwatering will yellow & rot them.1/4 strength will do ok, in the growing season use porous orchid mix; then you can water/fertilize with about 80 degree warm water, any time of the day, during the growing season.i lost all my big orchid plants recently and am down to one phaelenopsis which has yet to bloom, but looks nice and healthy.special orchid clay pots have holes and slits all around the pot.
