soap remains the best long term agent/survival-tool for killing germs (while other sanitation substances do exist); soap is available for sale at most commercial areas enroute for travelers (store, shop or roadside stand).liquefied gas stoves are especially practical for travel in the usa, europe, japan, and populated areas of asia and north america (versus mongolia, afghanistan, alaska, and the yukon) - the most accessible and most available fuel on the planet is unleaded gasoline (not wood, not propane).these trees usually live but the trees are stressed and will not hold up well to subsequent micro-biological plant or animal attacks.synthetic clothing tends to be much more prone to fire spark damage and burns faster than organic clothing if flash exposed to open fire.this action may allow cyclists to get moving or keep moving at key times and therefore not leave a person extra hurried or worried in case of a breakdown or other untoward situation.synthetic clothing, when worn in a fire/hot atmosphere will damage the human body more than its organic clothing counterpart, in fact cotton and wool offer a little protection or burn delay when compared to synthetic clothing.synthetic clothing, when designed for such, can wick moisture away from the body far better than for organic clothing.some work effort can be saved by soaking clothing before washing and in certain cases, apply some soap directly to a soiled or stained area for soaking.it takes too much time and energy to thaw frozen water and it takes too many human calories to warm water in the body.the use of disposable gloves (latex, nitrile, ...) helps greatly to keep one's self clean.while unprocessed oil comes from the ground/earth, returning processed oil to the earth is bad for drinking water and water tables.aircraft bearing based moving parts see a lot of heat and a lot of activity and are carefully monitored - lives depend on processes working correctly and dependably.water boils at lower temperatures at higher altitudes, which is potentially both a sanitation and cooking issue (air pressure).which is one of the reasons why it is wise to have institutions of learning to record ideas, test concepts, and advance proven arguments.while cosmoline or similar preservatives prevent rust or corrosion, it attracts and holds dirty particles like dust, dirt, or earth debris.
