many bathrooms are  wired so that all the lights go out if a gfci is tripped.
the main material choices for kitchen and bathroom sinks are outlined below  (table 6-9).
a variation on cement backerboard, hardibacker (james hardie building products), is made of fiber-cement.
for example, choose only nonskid flooring types and select tub and shower controls with foolproof antiscald protection.
rigid thermofoil (rtf) cabinets.
a guide to kitchen & bath faucet styles most homeowners find single-handle faucets more convenient, and experts  consider them safer for kids than separate hot and cold levers, which are more  likely to cause a scalding injury.
let them dry for an hour and then see how easily they clean up with normal household cleansers and nonabrasive cleaning pads.
if a crack in the concrete substrate runs  diagonal to the grout joints, the soft joint must run in a zigzag pattern on  each side of the crack.
lay  the plywood with its long dimension across the joists and use solid blocking at  all open joints.
side-by-side units with doors that swing back a full 180 degrees are preferable to up-and-down models.
tiles, stones, and grout joints crack easily from stresses imposed by  movement.
seating widths have  been increased to 30 inches in the 30-inch-high seating area to accommodate  wheelchairs.
if loads are likely to exceed these, upgrade to a stronger shelf (see table 5-11, page 186).
the pump comes with a cord and plug that requires a gfci-protected receptacle.
on large spans or where significant  movement is expected in the floor due to wide moisture or temperature swings, a  crack-isolation membrane is recommended as a precaution against cracking.
directly over any expansion, control, construction, or  cold joint expansion joints should be at least 1/4 inch wide and free of grout,  backerboard, or tile adhesive.
power-assisted toilets cost about $100 to $150 more than comparable  gravity models.
a polished finish offers some protection against stains but  can also make floors slippery and requires maintenance to preserve the sheen.
these materials are described in greater detail below.
one-piece units tend to have low sleek lines and cost substantially more than standard two-piece models where the tank is bolted to the bowl during installation (figure 6-55).
limestones and softer marbles are not suitable for floors either.
vacuum-assisted toilets use the same flush and fill valves as gravity flush  toilets, making them easy to maintain.

because it is tough and durable, mosaic tile can work well on just about any application, including floors, shower stalls, and counters.
while  most of the materials discussed below are at least moderately stain-resistant,  the actual performance will vary, depending on the specific color, pattern,  finish texture (gloss vs. matte), and porosity of the material.
please see kitchen layouts, typical for the detailed, illustrated version of this section.
with nonvitreous tiles, which soak up moisture, it is best to mist or  sponge the tiles just before grouting so the grout will cure properly.
strength and water absorption of ceramic tiles the body of a ceramic tile, also called the bisque, is made by heating a  mixture of clay and other additives in a kiln.
recommend that homeowners set water heaters to no more than 120°f as an added precaution.
because cbus provide little added  stiffness, it is best to upgrade to a 23/32-inch subfloor.
because porcelain is impervious to water absorption and because the mounting sheet can interfere with the bond, it should be installed with a polymer-modified thinset mortar made for use with porcelain.
midrange faucets use brass or chrome plating on zinc alloys, which provides good durability, but must be replaced when the plating wears through.
tiles can be applied directly to a clean, smooth concrete slab with a latex portland cement mortar.
the alumina trihydrate filler also makes solid surfacing fire resistant, although it is possible to scorch the surface.
operating characteristics of power-assisted toilets widely used in commercial settings, these toilets have a sealed chamber in  the tank that fills after each flush, using the home’s water pressure to  compress the air trapped inside.
most solid surface sinks have a  matte finish, which is easier to maintain than a semi gloss or high-gloss.
this type of sink provides  the most streamlined appearance and easiest cleanup, but it is also the most  costly to buy and install.
most solid surfacing used on countertops has a matte-satin finish, which is the easiest to maintain.

sand is added to grout to strengthen the grout where joints are wider than 1/8 inch.
some manufacturers allow the buyer to specify the pump location for better access.
there are many styles of mixer valves in tubs and showers, but all should  have some sort of protection against scalding.
if using a postformed counter with a miter joint, it is essential to  mechanically draw the joint tight and to seal that joint to prevent water  intrusion, which will degrade the particleboard and open the joint.
before selecting a countertop color, it is a good idea to test a few sample  squares with an indelible marker to see how easily the marks clean off.
from there, work typically flows to the sink and food prep area, then on to the cooktop or oven, and eating area.
a check valve is required on the cold water side to prevent backflow, and a hot-water expansion tank is recommended to prevent excessive pressure on the hot water side.
acrylic bathtub & shower properties see description (above), under sink materials.
a few tubs are designed with individual bearing points molded into the bottom of the tub.
upgrading to 23/32- inch plywood will stiffen the subfloor by almost 80% and provide a more solid feeling floor.
to prevent moisture from passing through the tile and substrate to the plywood or wood framing, a moisture barrier is required in areas subject to high moisture levels or occasional wetting, such as tub surrounds and kitchen counters.
very high heat or humidity can cause cracking or  delamination.

installation procedures for stone tiles installation of stone tile is essentially the same as with ceramic tile  except for the following: deflection of substrate.
most grouts also contain latex or acrylic additives to  improve their performance.
driven by cost savings on both materials  and installation, manufactures have introduced lighter-weight alternatives  using molded plastics (table 6-10).
either a power-blast cleaning machine or a rotary sander with a coarse  carborundum sanding sheet can be used.
it is applied as described above under “membranes” (previous  page), although joints between sheets do not need to be solvent welded unless  waterproofing is also required.
cleaning instructions vary  from manufacturer to manufacturer, but most recommend mild nonabrasive  cleansers and nylon scrub pads for everyday cleaning and  scotchbriteâ„¢ pads and abrasive cleansers as needed.
composite sink guide similar to solid surfacing, composite sinks are a cast polymer using  crushed quartz or granite as the filler.

use the tip of a margin trowel to clean up any corners or problem joints.
inspectapedia tolerates no conflicts of interest.
polymer-modified thinset can absorb small amounts of movement, but where more significant movement is expected, a crack isolation membrane is the safest approach.
it provides high-bond strength and impact-resistance over most sound substrates, including plywood.
for example, memrysafe and scaldshield (antiscald inc.) are inexpensive retrofit devices that reduce the water flow to less than 1/4 gallon per minute when the water temperature at the faucet or showerhead exceeds 120°f.
plywood is made from thin wood sheets laminated to each  other with the grain running at right angles in alternate plies for strength.
the garbage  disposal must also be offset so it does not interfere with knee space.
(tca specs now permit 1/4 inch in 10 feet, but this can be problematic for the  large tiles popular today.)
setting compounds, grouts, preformed shower  pans, curbs, and niches.
also,  colored grouts, plumber’s putty, and some caulks will stain  lighter-colored stones and porous stones.
coverage varies depending on the type of substrate and tile, as  well as the heat and humidity in the environment.

grout installation details: mixing & application mix the tile grout by hand or with a paddle bit run at slow speed (air  bubbles from fast mixing will weaker the mix).
properly formed joints are generally flat for square-edge tiles and slightly concave for rounded-edge tiles.
if all these  products are installed following the manufacturer’s instructions as well  as the specifications of the tile council of america (tca), the result should  be an attractive and durable job.
for a successful installation, the structure underneath must be very  stiff.
the sheen, however, can be restored with a thin coat of auto wax or gel gloss (tr industries).
similar to solid surfacing, composite sinks are a cast polymer using crushed quartz or granite as the filler.
in lower-end cabinets, drawer sides are often particleboard or mdf wrapped in vinyl and nailed or stapled and glued together, with a particleboard or hardboard bottom.
using a rubber grout float held at about 45 degrees to the tiles, force  the grout into the joints from several directions.
if the client plans to wash hair, water plants, or perform other household chores at the lavatory, an oversized bowl is recommended.
once the grout is firm, typically in 15 to 30 minutes, clean the surface  of the tiles with a sweeping motion, using a large clean round-edged sponge  squeezed as dry as possible (water splashed on the joint lines can weaken the  grout or cause splotchy coloring).

details about anti-scald  protection and devices are found atmixing / anti-scald valves.
avoid designs with sunken tubs or tub surrounds with steps, both of which are hazards.
it is widely used in vanity sinks, but because the china substrate will chip more easily than other materials, it is not commonly used in kitchens.
since all exhaust fans require makeup air, the bathroom door needs to be undercut to provide makeup air when bathroom windows are closed.
also make sure the base (foot) of the toilet is flat or it will have a  tendency to rock and break the seal, leading to odors and leakage.
protect users from exposed pipes and mechanicals with a protective panel and insulation (figure 6-12).
softer tiles are prone to chipping, but damaged tiles  can be removed and replaced if necessary.
most industry experts recommend that overhead range hoods have a minimum  capacity of 150 cfm and recommend higher capacity fans for open grilling,  high-btu commercial-style ranges, and other cooking styles that generate  greater than average steam or smoke (seetable 6-14).

on the other hand it is very heavy, cold to the touch, and  available only in pretty basic shapes.
also,  it is best if the toilet sits on top of the finished flooring rather than  having a dirt-trapping joint where the finished floor abuts the fixture.
at the curb, the membrane must be cut so  it can fold over the top of the curb.
while this strategy is helpful, it is not always reliable and can cause other problems: this is the most commonly used point-of-supply approach.
for larger scratches, use 400- to 600-grit sandpaper and buff with baking soda.

as with other  tile substrates, follow manufacturer’s instructions closely regarding  framing, installation, and tile application.
bathroom ventilation should be powerful enough to remove excess moisture before it has time to condense on cold walls and windows, potentially damaging finishes, or escape into wall or ceiling cavities, where it may lead to decay or peeling paint.
most early models were essentially 3.5 gallon designs hastily modified with  smaller tanks and narrower trapways intended to increase the flow rate.
two details that will enhance a tile counter are a v-cap nosing tile, which  will create a clean-looking dripless edge, and a coved corner at the  backsplash, which will make it easier to keep the corner clean.
how well a glaze resists abrasion and shows scratches depends on several factors: unglazed tiles show the natural color of the clay, although some unglazed mosaics have pigment added to the clay.
they are usually made from semivitreous or vitreous clay or  impervious porcelain, making them suitable for outdoor use.

if used on a counter, make sure the sealer is suitable for use around food.
with high-powered fans, multi speed controls are best so the fan speed (and noise) can be lowered when full power is not required.
while not as strong as cement backerboard, gypsum-based backerboard  installs faster since it cuts and installs like drywall.
epoxy tile grouts resist stains for a higher degree of stain-resistance as well as moderate resistance to  some chemicals, epoxy grout is a good option for applications such as showers,  bathroom floors, or heavily used kitchen counters.
it can be seamlessly welded to itself at joints and to under mount sinks made of the same material.
this type of sink, sometimes called a  “tile edge” sink, is designed to sit level with the countertop and  is often used with tile counters.
the metal will tarnish, however, when the coating  eventually wears off or where it gets scratched.
the main problem with tile counters are the grout joints, which tend to discolor over time.
damp curing recommended for portland cement grout traditional portland cement grout requires several days of damp curing to  reach its full strength.

pumps range from 1/2 to 3 horsepower, and many manufacturers offer a horsepower upgrade for a modest price increase, often a worthwhile expense.
one-piece models are generally easier to clean, since there are fewer crevices between the bowl and tank to collect dirt.
while the standard vanity or sink height is 30 to  32 inches, 34 inches is a better compromise between shorter and taller users.
the gypsum core is treated with silicone to make it water-resistant, and the fiberglass and acrylic facing acts as a surface vapor barrier.
also the  center panel in a frame-and-panel door may show a paint line if the panel  shrinks during the heating season.
the advertised airflow of bath fans is typically based on  a static pressure of 0.1 (inches of water gauge) although some also publish the  airflow rating at 0.25 inches, which gives a better estimate of actual airflow  in most installations.
harsh, abrasive cleansers and abrasive pads  will dull the surface and a hard enough blow with a sharp object can chip the  coating exposing the iron beneath to rust.
unvented range hoods offer no protection  against moisture and combustion gases and provide only minimal protection  against grease, smoke, and odors trapped by the filter.
pre sealers, applied before grouting, help prevent stains and simplify cleanup, particularly with non polished finishes.
use of water pressure-balancing valves to control temperature & avoid  scalding this is the most commonly used point-of-supply approach.
on any stone floor, sand, dirt, and grit do the most damage due to their  abrasiveness.
one exception is a corner-recessed tall tower if knee space is planned to one side.
in new construction  bathrooms, cultured marble is the leading material for lavatory sinks, while  the more expensive vitreous china leads in remodels.

these have a rubber washer on the bottom of a  threaded stem, which opens and closes as the knob is twisted.
if  cold water is diverted to a flushing toilet or other appliance and the pressure  drops, the valve automatically reduces the hot water flow proportionately to  maintain the temperature.
polymer-modified mortar uses for floor tile installation polymer modified mortar for floor tiles is essentially dry-set mortar with  latex or acrylic polymers added to increase the bond strength, compressive  strength, and flexibility of the compound.
the facings on better cabinets are usually high-pressure  laminate or real wood veneer.
the material is stiffer and quieter than regular enameled steel, but it is half the weight of cast iron.
solid surfacing also offers great design flexibility, as most fabricators can build nearly any configuration desired.
many “builders’ grade” lavatory sinks are undersized for  basic grooming tasks, such as tooth brushing and face washing without splashing  water across the vanity top.
in repair work or other jobs where covering an entire floor with isolation  membrane is not feasible, a strip of membrane can be installed over just a  crack, change of materials, or control joint where minor movement is expected.
a tub with a nonslip surface is recommended for safety.
sheet membranes can be applied to most tile substrates with either thinset mortar or a proprietary adhesive, and tiles are bonded directly to the membrane.
finally, it is critical that the installer leave the required expansion  joints at the room perimeter, tub lips, and other places the tile is  restrainedâ€”the source of many tile callbacks.

do not separate two primary work centers (primary sink, refrigerator, preparation area, or cooking center) by a full-height, full depth tower such as an oven cabinet, pantry cabinet, or refrigerator.
with larger tubs, often holding 50 to 80  gallons of water (at 8 pounds per gallon), the framing and subfloor may need to  be reinforced to support the total weight of the tub, water, and bathers.
because they are handmade, they have uneven faces and vary in color and texture from tile to tile, giving a floor a rustic appearance (figure 6-31).
small chips can be repaired with special sealers, but scratches and burns are permanent.
a ventilating fan must overcome the resistance, called “static pressure,” created by the ductwork, including transitions, elbows, and the wall or roof cap.
use of doormats and frequent sweeping  to remove abrasives from the floor will help prolong the finish.
penetrating sealers have the advantage of easy refinishing of worn  spots, whereas surface coatings need to be stripped before being reapplied.
energy-efficient models capture waste heat from the motor and  pump to provide a modest degree of supplemental heat, while others use a  conventional electrical heating element that can maintain the water temperature  indefinitely.

the nonporous surface is virtually stain-proof and very scratch-resistant, although it should not be used as a cutting board.
typical bathroom layouts with minimum dimensions for  comfortable use are shown infigure 6-20.
these are either site-mixed from a bag or installed by a specialty subcontractor.
it is important to have solidly built drawers, since they get a lot of use and abuse.
typical installations include: backerboard on walls: cbus can go directly over studs at  16 inches on-center or over drywall, and it is fastened with 1 1/2 -inch  galvanized roofing nails or special self-countersinking galvanized screws at 6  to 8 inches on-center.
the type and amount of filler largely determines the hardness, stain  resistance, and overall durability of the product.
we have no relationship with advertisers  nor with topics or services discussed at this website.
because there is no standardized testing, figuring out which models perform  well is difficult.
if the  cold water fails or the tempered water is still too hot for any reason, the  unit will shut off the flow.
a tile sold for use on floors will not  necessarily have a hard scratch-resistant glaze, however.
in addition to providing a visual focal point, durable and easy-to-clean counters are critical for both hygiene and efficiency.
also, with some types of membrane, the contractor can offset the  sealant-filled “soft joints” in the tile, so they do not have to  fall directly over the crack or control joint in a concrete slab.
while this strategy is helpful, it is not  always reliable and can cause other problems: noncompliance: many homeowners turn the thermostats up to  increase supply.
neoangle showers: neoangle showers are popular space  savers, but the showering area is reduced in size due to the cut-off corner.
for best performance  use a heavy-duty sheet membrane, such as 40-mil chloraloy (noble company),  which is designed for use in shower pans and similar applications.

they are common on lower-end cabinets.
most now use a water-soluble formula, although some still use petroleum-based solvents.
the substrate must be very flat, since mastic is troweled on thin and cannot bridge low spots or uneven joints.
it is also useful with questionable substrates such as existing tile, sheet vinyl, or plastic laminate, all of which are suitable for epoxy as long as they are sound and the surfaces are roughed up.
we found that some brands (including  kohler™) can list stunning prices for small replacement parts for  faucets, cartridges, and handles - df.
backs and floors if cabinets range from flimsy 1/8- or 1/4 -inch hardboard  to thicker particleboard, mdf, or plywood (in order of stiffness).

thermofoil is available in many colors and woodgrain patterns, although white  is the most common.
a manual override  allows normal operation of the fan for other bathroom uses.
between coats,  fabricators typically reinforce tub and shower walls and floors with blocks of  wood or corrugated cardboard.
handmade pavers, on the other hand, tend to be relatively soft, unglazed,  nonvitreous tiles, so they are not suitable for wet interior applications or  outdoors in areas subject to freeze/thaw cycles.
a shower pan must be completely watertight and able to hold pooled water should the drain get clogged.
unsuitable substrates that should not be used under tile include  oriented-strand board (osb), lower grades of plywood with voids, and interior  grade plywoods such as lauan.
the most common method to support the tub bottom and dampen vibration is to  set the tub onto several small mounds of wet plaster or mortar mix that  compress and conform to the shape of the tub bottom as it is installed.
lever-action handles work well for doors and faucets.
elastomeric and  liquid-applied membranes, self-leveling underlayments, setting compounds, and  grouts laticrete international www.laticrete.com
grab bars should be from 1 1/4
another option for floors are honed or thermal finished granite tiles,  which are more commonly used outdoors.
from there,  work typically flows to the sink and food prep area, then on to the cooktop or  oven, and eating area.
to prevent moisture  from passing through the tile and substrate to the plywood or wood framing, a  moisture barrier is required in areas subject to high moisture levels or  occasional wetting, such as tub surrounds and kitchen counters.
an oven with a side-hinged door rather than the usual pull-down style works well.
swing angles range from 95 to 175 degrees, with typical doors opening from 105  to 110 degrees.
abrasive cleansers must not be used.
another option is a de humidistat switch, which will automatically operate the fan whenever the humidity level rises above a preset level.

around the perimeter of a room or wherever tile meets a  different material or abuts restraining surfaces, such as curbs, columns, or  pipes.
one of the premium manufacturers of fiberglass tubs, aqua glass, uses a layer of rigid polyurethane foam between fiberglass coats, creating a stiffer assembly that helps the tub retain heat and deadens sound.
select grade 3 or higher where scratching of  the tile surface is a concern.
some store three or more gallons in the tank to create greater pressure, but only let 1.6 gallons drain in each flush.
with high-powered fans, multi speed controls are best so  the fan speed (and noise) can be lowered when full power is not required.
because solid surfacing is nonporous, stains do not penetrate and it will  not support mold or bacterial growth.
also apply thinset mortar to only one small section at a  timeâ€”no larger than the area that can be tiled before the  thinset skins over.
in general, they provide excellent resistance against stains, scratches, chips, and fading.
unglazed tiles show the natural color of the clay, although some unglazed  mosaics have pigment added to the clay.
some require setting in sand, wet mortar, or plaster.
if the kitchen has a second wall, use it for storage with  pegboards or shelving narrow enough to leave adequate clearance.
a  fiberglass mesh may also be laminated to the back to provide stability.
if household traffic must regularly pass through, provide at least 48 inches of clearance between counters.
this layout provides adequate counter space and creates an efficient work triangle away from the household traffic flow.
avoid making wrinkles here or along the bottom of the pan.
if a wood floor or slab needs leveling, you can use special cement leveling compounds formulated for use as a substrate for ceramic tile or stone tile.
hinges attach to these face-frames, which are  usually partly or fully visible with the doors closed.
softer and more porous stones, such as limestone and sandstones, are prone to excess wear and staining and are rarely used in kitchens and baths.
these are commonly used with solar water heaters but can also be tied to a conventional water heater.
there are now many alternatives to the traditional square edge that exposes  the dark edge of the horizontal sheet of laminate.
some of the softer stones, such  as marble and limestone, require a stiffer floor than the l/360 required for  ceramic tile.
marble comes in a wide variety of colors and levels of quality, ranging from grade a with few to no flaws or voids to grade d, which has a large proportion of flaws, voids, veins, and lines of separation that need to be repaired with fillers and adhesives during fabrication of the tiles.
the faucet valve is the mechanism that regulates the flow of water when you turn the lever or knob.
because it is only  1/4 inch thick, it is usually installed over 1/4 -inch plywood, both for  stiffness and to bring it flush with the surrounding drywall.
with vinyl flooring, the flange can sit directly on the  subfloor.
since no one product can meet every need in a home, it often makes sense to mix and match materials, particularly in the kitchen.
edge treatment choices for countertops
as long as the subfloor is sufficiently stiff to prevent  flexing, these units should perform well with 4x4â€“inch tiles.
this is a concern wherever floors are subject to wetting, but particularly on shower floors and bathroom floors near tubs and showers.
in retrofits, point-of-use devices can be installed by a plumber or homeowner to limit water temperatures to 120°f.
lavatories: sink clearances, heights, measurements clearances.

these are partially concealed  when closed and are usually adjustable in two directions by loosening the  hinge-mounting screws.
although it will not burn or scorch, placing hot pots directly on the surface can cause surface damage from the thermal shock.
with any product, it is important to  follow the manufacturer’s instructions regarding application and  compatibility with the particular substrate (seetable 6-7).
electric cooktops with a smooth  surface and controls on the front work best so the user does not have to reach  over the top.
also, household traffic is naturally directed around the work area, keeping it clear for kitchen tasks.
also, screws in the upper layer, which serves as underlayment for the tile, should penetrate the subfloor only and not the joists.
solid bridging should also be  added to help distribute the load to the surrounding joists.
how well a particular fan can overcome the ductwork’s resistance to  airflow is highly variable and is indicated by its fan curve, available from  the manufacturer.
metal scouring pads or cast-iron cookware can leave rust stains on composite sinks.
wood-framed floors with long joist spans of 16  feet or more are also good candidates for isolation membranes.
installation is with  roofing nails or galvanized bugle-head drywall screws, which should be driven  flush with the surface but should not break the waterproof skin.
so they do not interfere with sight lines.
noise issues with jetted tubs & spas jetted tubs can be rather noisy.
the minimum guidelines below, based on ansi standard a117.1, are a good starting point in design, but they should be tailored to the size, reach, and specific capabilities of the occupants.
a manual override allows normal operation of the fan for other bathroom uses.
high-pressure plastic laminate cabinet doors and drawer fronts are more durable than melamine (low-pressure laminate).
how well a glaze resists abrasion and shows  scratches depends on several factors: temperature: glazes fired hotter and longer tend to be  harder and more scratch-resistant.
for a standard installation, choose a slightly larger fan  size than required.
marble and limestone tile use & installation advice for kitchens &  baths both marble and limestone are carbonates, made from ancient shells, sand,  and mud, although marbles have been additionally heated and squeezed until  crystallized.
darker stones will etch more noticeably.
in addition to their higher cost, these products have precise mixing requirements, a short pot life, and more difficult cleanup than standard thinsets.
bathroom safety concerns should be paramount in design decisions and material choices.
types of jets used in whirlpools & spas or tubs some manufacturers offer different types of jets with different flow  characteristics.
advice for bath fan controls the home ventilating institute (hvi) recommends that a fan be left on for  20 minutes after use of a bath or shower to remove all excess moisture from the  room and ductwork.
after the cabinets, the countertop is the most visible element in most kitchen and bath designs.
use a separate wall-mounted oven, not an under-counter design.
in response, many state and local codes now require antiscald  protection in residential tubs and showers.
this makes them easier to reach for all users.
like other acrylic fixtures, it is reinforced with a fiberglass backing.
panels are butted tightly and the joints are taped and embedded with latex  portland cement mortar, also used to set the tile.
it swells and degrades when wet and is used for drawer bottoms, backs,  and bottoms of lower-end cabinets.
nonporous surfaces like plastic laminate, solid surface, and engineered  stone fit the bill well.
for example, a bathroom with a toilet, shower, and jetted tub  would require 200 cfm (50 + 50 + 100) of ventilation either in a single fan or  multiple fans placed over the fixtures being vented.
while relatively easy to scratch or scorch, this type of damage is superficial and is easy to sand away with fine sandpaper or a scotchbriteâ¢ pad.
most modern grouts with latex or acrylic additives, however, do not require wet curing except in very hot, dry weather.
frame-and-panel wood doors are  typically more expensive than laminate or thermofoil doors.
solid bridging should also be added to help distribute the load to the surrounding joists.
driven by cost savings on both materials and installation, manufactures have introduced lighter-weight alternatives using molded plastics (table 6-10).
most faucets also have improved valve  systems that make leaky faucets a thing of the past.
dry-set mortar use for floor tiles dry set mortar for floor tile installation is a factory blend of sand,  cement, retarders, and other additives that is mixed with water on the job  site.
stone and agglomerate stone tiles are popular choices in kitchens and baths due to their durability and natural beauty.

the company also adds an antimicrobial compound to the gel coat to inhibit the growth of bacteria and mold.
to insure longevity, use brass closet bolts, nuts, and washers rather  than the plated steel that is often packaged with the toilet.
for larger scratches,  use 400- to 600-grit sandpaper and buff with baking soda.
some tile has a special nonskid surface made by adding an abrasive grit to the tile face or glaze.
used in both flat and raised panels, veneer provides good grain matching.
although cured grout, like other masonry products, is unaffected by water, it cannot be relied on as a waterproof material.
many natural stone tiles require stiffer conditions, ranging from l/480 to as stiff as l/720.
curing compounds or old adhesives used for carpeting or resilient flooring will act as bond breakers, so they need to be removed before installing the tile.
sheet membranes: these single-layer elastomerics, such as  chlorinated polyethylene (cpe), are bonded to the  substrateâ€”typically cement backerboard, plywood, or a mortar  bedâ€”with a compatible thinset mortar or proprietary adhesive ( figure 6-36).
examples are noble-seal  ts (noble company) and dal-seal ts (dal-tile corp.), both 30-mil thick cpe.

the membrane should run up all sides of the shower, at least 3 inches above the height of the finished curb.
in smaller bathrooms, these all share one common space, while in more spacious rooms, the grooming area or toilet area may be separated to allow greater flexibility and privacy for multiple users.
when  using wood-grain thermofoil, it is best to use full-overlay doors and matching  thermofoil moldings, since real wood finishes will age differently than the  thermofoil.
a raised or  gooseneck-type faucet allows large pots to be easily rinsed or filled (figure  6-48).
some economy  models use plastic.
provide the minimum cabinet frontage shown in table 6-1 below.
a relative newcomer, acrylic sinks are made of the same materials as acrylic tubs or showers.

also solvents, such as nail polish  remover (acetone), can soften the epoxy coating.
standard cast-iron and  stainless-steel sinks have a metal flange that hides any rough cuts in the  countertop but tends to collect grime where it joins the counter.
install ground-fault circuit interrupters (gfcis) on all receptacles within the kitchen.
for example, the sinks made  from moenstone (moen) and kindred granite (fhp kindred) can tolerate  temperatures up to 530°f for short periods.
one way to assess quality is to look for tubs that conform to the voluntary standard ansi z-124, which requires that a random sampling of acrylic and gel-coat tubs undergo a variety of durability tests.
the substructure must be stiff enough to support the tile without excess  movement or deflection, and the tile, backerboard, adhesive, grout, and any  waterproofing membrane must be compatible with one another.
each line comes in a limited number of materials,  styles, and options.
it does not easily mold into the  body-hugging contours found on many of the plastic units.
while this may be  adequate for a small bath, the guidelines of the home ventilating institute  (hvi) are more suitable for larger rooms: small baths:
dark green marble, called serpentine, is actually a much harder silicate.
this is a  concern wherever floors are subject to wetting, but particularly on shower  floors and bathroom floors near tubs and showers.
cement backerboard is impervious to moisture, but may let moisture pass through, so it should always be backed by a waterproof barrier, such as polyethylene sheeting or asphalt-impregnated felt.
the main advantage of solid-surface sinks is that they can be installed seamlessly to the underside of a solid-surface counters.
the nonporous surface resists mildew and most stains and is  easily cleaned with nonabrasive cleaning agents.
the vanity area should include both overhead and side lighting.
some high-capacity ventilators are designed to work from 24 to 30 inches above the cooking surface, but the stronger fans increase the risk of backdrafting other combustion appliances.
safety rails should be installed to help users get in  and out of any tub configuration.
polymer modified mortar for floor tiles is essentially dry-set mortar with latex or acrylic polymers added to increase the bond strength, compressive strength, and flexibility of the compound.

these finishes are easy to apply and do not need stripping for touch-up  reapplication.
a layer of sealant applied between the membrane and lower flange serves as backup waterproofing.
fillers are used to fit the  cabinets into place.
also this does not prevent  dripping from the bowl or water supply line.
rinse the sponge frequently, always  keeping it as dry as possible.
also, with some types of membrane, the contractor can offset the sealant-filled “soft joints” in the tile, so they do not have to fall directly over the crack or control joint in a concrete slab.
as with all tile products, check the label for instructions.
the best solution is to use an epoxy grout and to choose a dark or neutral grout color such as gray.
a fiberglass mesh may also be laminated to the back to provide stability.
access panel designs for whirlpool baths, jetted tubs, spas with a custom-built surround, it is necessary to leave an access panel.
because they are farther from the cooktop and subject to passing air currents, they require more powerful fans than standard wall-mounted hoods.
when installing serpentine, epoxy-based mortars and adhesives are preferable to water- or latex-based products.
under mount slides have the advantage of helping to support the drawer while remaining out of sight.
tile contractors typically use the same type of elastomeric membrane used for waterproofing, such as noble- seal ts (noble company) or dal-seal ts (dal tile).
since these are made to order,  however, the buyer has many more choices for wood species and finishes,  laminates, door styles, and storage options and accessories.
polymer additives for tile grout most grouts now have latex or acrylic compounds added either to the dry  mix at the factory or as liquid on the job site.
inset doors provide an attractive furniture like appearance, but they are  also a common cause of callbacks, since the slightest movement in cabinets or  hinges can cause the doors or drawers to rub.
good quality hinges are sturdy, smooth to operate, and easy to adjust.
the unit will compensate for changes in either pressure or  temperature to maintain a constant delivery temperature and flow rate.
use a shallow sink mounted at 32 to 34 inches (32 preferred) with the drain in the rear so it does not interfere with knee space (figure 6-15).
epoxy mortar for flooring is generally used for floors and countertops that require moderate chemical resistance, or where higher bond strength is needed to withstand greater loading, impacts, and flexing.
the highest-quality faucets use solid forged or machined brass, which will  last the longest and require the least care, particularly in areas with hard  water.
many manufacturers now rate the abrasion resistance of their tile using the  guidelines of the porcelain enamel institute (pei).
it is applied as described above under “membranes” (previous page), although joints between sheets do not need to be solvent welded unless waterproofing is also required.
for either type of shower, an additional 12 to 18 inches beyond each end is desirable for better access to controls and to ease transfers (figure 6-25).
provide at least 15 inches of landing space, a  minimum of 16 inches deep above, below, or to the side of the microwave oven.
jetted tubs can be rather noisy.
kitchen cabinets range widely in styles, materials, and levels of quality.
this will limit any movement in the fixture that could break the seal at the wax ring.
to  ensure safety, make sure that the unit purchased is ul-listed for the entire  system, not just the individual components.
whether designing a small galley kitchen or an expansive space for multiple cooks and entertaining, the same rules apply regarding clearances and relationships between key work centers so that work in the kitchen flows smoothly and efficiently.
instructions for tile preparation & tile grouting allow the adhesive to dry at least overnight, or longer if recommended by  the manufacturer, before grouting.
kitchen range hood location advice research at the university of minnesota has shown that many range hoods are  too small, too high, or not oriented properly to do their job well.
the cabinet industry generally divides cabinets into three main grades:  stock, semicustom, and custom.
kitchen work triangle specifications the shortest walking distance between the refrigerator, primary sink, and  primary cooktop should be 26 feet or less, as shown infigure 6-1 above.
bath fan ductwork specifications a ventilating fan must overcome the resistance, called “static  pressure,” created by the ductwork, including transitions, elbows, and  the wall or roof cap.

when selecting a material and finish, consider durability and  ease-of-cleaning as well as appearance.
beveled  laminate, solid surfacing, and hardwood edging are common details.
guide to types of cabinet hinges good quality hinges are sturdy, smooth to operate, and easy to adjust.
the polished disks are  nearly indestructible, but eventually the grease between the disks washes out  or the washers or o-rings wear out.
whatever style is chosen, levers are easier  to manipulate than knobs, particularly for anyone with restricted mobility.
if this is the home’s only tub, be  aware that deep tubs with a wide top edge or tile ledge can be awkward for  bathing small children.
while granite holds its polish longer than marble and is not  bothered by mild acids, such as orange juice or vinegar, over time the traffic  on a kitchen floor will dull the finish.
if the occupants expect to take long soaks in the tub, an accessory heater is advisable.
secure the membrane to the framing with galvanized staples or roofing nails along the top edge, being careful to make no holes in the membrane any lower than 2 inches above the finished curb.
the manufacturer claims that the high gloss finish has the durability of acrylic and the ease of repair of fiberglass at roughly 40% less than the cost of acrylic.
also, clip or round over countertop corners and edges to eliminate sharp edges.
plywood is the strongest shelving material, followed by mdf, then particleboard.
a coved corner at the backsplash makes this joint easier  to keep clean.
with some cabinet lines, it is possible to order plywood sides only where  needed, for example, on the sink base and wherever there is an exposed end  panel, which might be subject to wetting or the occasional dent or nick.
although this is  allowed by code, it is neither safe nor convenient for the homeowners.
a few companies also  sell stand-alone solid-surface shower pans.
scrape away the excess grout with the float held at about 90 degrees to  the surface.
grab bar locations & installation requirements for accessible bathrooms these should be installed in the bathtub or shower and toilet areas for  full accessibility.
taller people will generally need larger  tubs to stretch out.
for example, memrysafe and scaldshield (antiscald inc.) are inexpensive  retrofit devices that reduce the water flow to less than 1/4 gallon per minute  when the water temperature at the faucet or showerhead exceeds 120°f.
however, when congress mandated in 1992 that manufacturers had two years to  reduce water usage to 1.6 gpf, the engineering challenges were much greater.
one type, called epoxy-emulsion grout, mixes a two-part epoxy with portland cement and sand.
(seekitchen lighting requirements).
it comes  applied to particleboard or mdf with a paper layer under the melamine that  provides the color or wood grain.
one-piece models are generally easier to clean, since there are fewer  crevices between the bowl and tank to collect dirt.
competing with cement backerboard, gypsum products such as georgia  pacific’s dens-shield® are designed as tile substrates for damp  areas.
re polishing the granite tends to be expensive due to the hardness of the material.
another option is a de humidistat switch, which will automatically operate the  fan whenever the humidity level rises above a preset level.
cultured marble, for example, which uses crushed limestone as a filler, is relatively soft and porous and needs to be protected by a gel coat.

please see grout installation, tile for the detailed, illustrated version of this section.
many require reapplication annually or more often, depending on the specific use.
while most of the materials discussed below are at least moderately stain-resistant, the actual performance will vary, depending on the specific color, pattern, finish texture (gloss vs. matte), and porosity of the material.
thin-walled pvc pipe works well and is easy to seal.
with sanded grout, it is also a good idea to strike the joints with a curved metal implement, such as the back of a spoon, a steel chisel handle, or the side of a nail set to help force any exposed sand below the surface.
in general, unglazed tiles or textured patterns will be less slippery.
porcelain mosaics are usually unglazed and are colored by adding pigment directly to the clay.
it is generally uniform in color and has high compressive strength and abrasion resistance.
this  make the joint smoother and easier to clean.
while these toilets are not for everyone, they are  particularly useful in retrofits where drainage is a problem, for example,  where venting is inadequate or where the toilet sits at the end of a long  drainage run with no fixtures upstream to wash the line.
with any membrane, check the label for compatibility with the  substrate and adhesives.
when set back in place and beat in with a rubber mallet (larger tiles) or beating block (smaller tiles such as mosaics), the setting bed should be about 3/32 inch but not larger than 1/4 inch, unless medium-set mortar is used.
typically sized at 400 to 600 cfm or more, they do a reasonable job of venting barbecues and grills, but are less effective with pots and pans taller than about 3 inches.

finishes range from matte to a satin semigloss.
jetted tubs come in a wide range of shapes, sizes, and depths and are designed for either a drop-in or niche installation with a tile flange.
the guidelines below, based on ansi (american national  standards institute) a117.1 standards, are a good starting point in design, but  they should be tailored to the size, reach, and specific capabilities of the  occupants.
small  1x1â€“inch porcelain tiles are commonly used on shower and  bathroom floors.
since all exhaust fans require makeup air, the  bathroom door needs to be undercut to provide makeup air when bathroom windows  are closed.
considered the most reliable  approach, this new type of valve uses hard ceramic disks that rotate in a  cartridge until the holes line up to release water.
in general, they provide excellent resistance against stains, scratches,  chips, and fading.
offset controls in  showers and tubs toward the room side, as shown infigure 6-27.
mount wall cabinet doors at the bottom of the cabinets and base cabinet pulls at the top of the cabinets.
for consumers seeking a resilient walking surface but reluctant to use  vinyl for environmental or health reasons, newer options include a variety of  cork products, newly introduced lines of traditional linoleum, and a variety of  laminated bamboo products that perform essentially the same as solid hardwood  flooring.
selecting tile for kitchens & baths a wide array of tiles are readily available.
density classes are l  (low), m (medium), and h (high).
in addition to traditional gravity designs, two types of  pressurized designs have been introduced: pressure-assisted and  vacuum-assisted.

in a u-shaped kitchen the minimum clearance between counters is 60  inches (figure 6-11).
initially introduced as corrigan® by dupont almost 40 years ago, solid surfacing products consist of mineral fillers, usually alumina trihydrate (a product of bauxite), and acrylic or polyester resins.
for either type of shower, an additional 12 to 18 inches beyond each  end is desirable for better access to controls and to ease transfers (figure  6-25).
larger spaces also allow for greater storage, such as a linen closet,  within the bathroom space.
if joint cleaning is rushed, the grout pulls out and smears the tile; too much delay causes it to harden before you can shape the joints.
all drawer slides, even with the same rating, are not alike.
it is commonly used over concrete  slabs, mortar beds, or cement backerboards.
guide to using tile grout sealers while latex or acrylic additives help protect the grout from staining,

a variation on cement backerboard, hardibacker  (james hardie building products), is made of fiber-cement.
place side lighting centered at eye level (seebathroom lighting guidelines).
they can be installed either inline near the water heater or as part of the shower control.
although the  first low-flow gravity toilets had trouble, many of the newer models have been  re engineered with higher tanks and larger trapways to improve the flush.
gravity-flush models are generally easy to maintain, although they are a  little more finicky than older 3.5 gallon models.
locate storage for toiletries, linens, and bathroom supplies within 15 to 48 inches from the floor.
although the surface is the most durable for molded tubs, it is not  indestructible.
however, demand has been growing for flush-set and under mount sinks, which cost more to buy and install, but have the benefits of a more streamlined appearance and easy cleaning (figure 6-49).
an application of gel-glosâ¢ (t.r. industries) or invisible shield® (unelko corp.) is recommended by some manufacturers to maintain the sheen and ease of cleaning.
vacuum-assisted toilets use the same flush and fill valves as gravity flush toilets, making them easy to maintain.
many tile manufacturers use a coefficient of friction (cof) to rate the traction a tile provides.
respectable drawers are also built with sides of 1/2 -inch or thicker  plywood or melamine stock dowelled together.
lavatory height and knee space for accessible bathrooms
the minimum ventilation rate for bathrooms required by the 2003  international residential code (irc) is 50 cfm intermittent or 20 cfm  continuous (if part of a whole-house ventilation system).
regardless, to keep grout from darkening and  staining, it will need regular cleaning with a grout cleaner or mild detergent.
to ensure safety, make sure that the unit purchased is ul-listed for the entire system, not just the individual components.
while accessible design  principles are provided separately below, nkba now incorporates these  principles into their recommendations for all projects.
typically, the whole cartridge is replaced.
as with the pressure-balancing valve, the installer sets a temperature limit stop to prevent the user from turning the shower control to scalding temperatures.
guide to using floor leveling compounds for setting tile
however, many customers prefer the look of a drop-in model with a custom tile  surround (seefigure 6-53).
they range in color from gray to browns and reds, depending on the type  of clay and firing temperature.
wall cabinet shelves should be adjustable and have solid clips, preferably metal.
they range in color from gray to browns and reds, depending on the type of clay and firing temperature.
these sinks weigh half or less than a comparable cast-iron model, making them easier on the installer.
floors must be level and subject to minimal deflection under uniform or point loads.
they also tolerate heat well.
in general, acrylic units cost more than fiberglass but are stronger and less prone to flexing and cracking.
agglomerate tiles consist of graded chips of marble or granite mixed with a resin binder and stone dust.
the main panel products, typically covered with a wood, melamine, or vinyl veneer, are listed below: these are the most common finish materials used for cabinet sides, interiors, and door and drawer fronts.
a hybrid alternative is american standard’s americast, which is a porcelain enameled steel reinforced on the back with a cast polymer.
full waterproofing is required in construction that must retain water, such as shower pans and tiled tubs.
wet or exterior applications require 95% coverage.
to  accommodate a seated user, below-counter knee space should be a minimum of 30  inches wide, 27 inches high in front, and 19 inches deep, with a minimum  9-inch-high toe space, which will accommodate most wheelchair footrests.
the tiles will stain, however, so they should be sealed with surface sealers where that is a concern (the material is too dense for penetrating oil sealers).
the plywood should be free of internal  voids such as underlayment grade, cc-plugged, or plugged crossbands , and if  tiling directly to plywood, it should have a sanded face free of voids, surface  resin, or other surface defects.
also if a chip is not repaired quickly, water can penetrate to the backing and cause the damage to spread.
it is best to test a sample for  compatibility before installation.
please see floor, stone, granite, marble, agglomer for the detailed, illustrated version of this section.
two-cook kitchen work triangles
comparison of the properties of glazed vs. unglazed ceramic tile
mix the tile grout by hand or with a paddle bit run at slow speed (air bubbles from fast mixing will weaker the mix).
a tile sold for use on floors will not necessarily have a hard scratch-resistant glaze, however.
doors for showers: shower doors must open into the  bathroom, not into the shower stall.
also avoid steel sinks with a polished finish, which is difficult to maintain.
many higher-end faucets now use a new high-tech plating technology called  physical-vapor deposition or pvd, which can imitate almost any metallic finish  from brass to pewter to gold.
the new granite and quartz “engineered stone” composites, on the other hand, are nearly indestructible.
well-made cultured marble, however, treated with reasonable care, can provide years of satisfactory service.
where the tub rim meets tile at a wall or the top of the surround, use a flexible caulk rather than grout, which will crack as the tub flexes, and expands and contracts with temperature changes.
in this case,  create soft joints on both sides of the crack or joint (figure 6-38), using a  flexible sealant instead of grout.
to guarantee that any trapped water will drain properly, the membrane is  placed on a layer of latex-modified mortar sloped 1/4 inch per foot toward the  drain.
originally designed for full-overlay doors on  frameless cabinets, concealed cup hinges are now available for most types of  doors and cabinets (figure 6-45).
(for more  information,see “backdrafting,” page 295).
is bonded to the subfloor with latex modified thinset, coated with a liquid waterproofing membrane, and is then ready to tile.
high-quality composites have similar characteristics to engineered stone counters, and in some cases are seamlessly cast from the same material (figure 6-50).
guide to moisture and water barriers for kitchen or bath tile although glazed ceramic tile is waterproof, neither the grout joints nor  the cement backerboard behind the tile are water barriers.
let them dry for an hour and then see how easily they clean up with  normal household cleansers and nonabrasive cleaning pads.
side-mounted slides that wrap around the drawer bottom also provide good support.
the unit will compensate for changes in either pressure or temperature to maintain a constant delivery temperature and flow rate.
do not count difficult-to-reach wall cabinets over hoods or refrigerators unless special access is provided.
the metal valve  seats also get worn over time and need to be ground with fine sandpaper to  prevent leaks.
may  need sealers depending on quality of stone.
some products require regular reapplication and may cause a surface buildup unless stripped.
the doors attach directly to the  inside face of the cabinet sides with cup hinges.
the material has no gel coat or layers to chip or crack and has color all  the way through.
white and light colors show stains the most.
the honed finish must be sealed to prevent permanent staining of the porous marble.
because porcelain is impervious to water absorption and because the mounting  sheet can interfere with the bond, it should be installed with a  polymer-modified thinset mortar made for use with porcelain.
in general, the longer the clay  is fired and the higher the temperature, the denser and stronger the tile will  be and the more impervious to water absorption.
irregular-shaped handmade tiles need some adhesive “back buttered” directly to the tile to obtain proper coverage.
built-in-place shower floors using a mortar bed and modern waterproofing membranes can provide many years of trouble-free service.
gravity-flush models are generally easy to maintain, although they are a little more finicky than older 3.5 gallon models.
while not as hard as the original iron tubs, the plastic alternatives have  improved over the years and provide great flexibility for designers.
seat the backerboard evenly with a beating block, then secure with roofing  nails or special backerboard screws.
respectable drawers are also built with sides of 1/2 -inch or thicker plywood or melamine stock dowelled together.
these include antiscald showerheads, as well as point-of-use devices that fit into individual plumbing fixtures, such as showerheads and bath and sink faucets.
walkways with counters or appliances on only one side can be 36 inches wide, but if a walkway turns a corner, as infigure 6-1 , one leg should be widened to 42 inches for a wheelchair to make the turn.
manufacturers offer a wide range of setting compounds formulated for different setting beds and conditions.
cast polymer products consist of a plastic  resin, either acrylic or polyester, and a mineral filler.
if a wood floor or slab needs leveling, you can use special cement leveling  compounds formulated for use as a substrate for ceramic tile or stone tile.
although glazed ceramic tile is waterproof, neither the grout joints nor the cement backerboard behind the tile are water barriers.
also, abrasive pads, such as steel wool or scotchbrite®, can scratch these or any finish with enough effort.
one alternative is a hybrid  from american standard called americast, introduced in the late 1980s, which  uses enameled steel on the inside and a cast-polymer composite on the outside  to create a sturdy tub with half the weight of cast iron.
however, accessibility experts often place them higher or lower based on an individual’s specific needs.
traditional portland cement grout requires several days of damp curing to reach its full strength.
while all toilets sold in the united states must meet the american society of mechanical engineers (asme) performance standard a112.119.2m, this only guarantees basic functionality.
small 1x1âinch porcelain tiles are commonly used on shower and bathroom floors.
using 5/8-inch drywall  or a second layer of 1/2-inch will provide a stiffer wall.
while not as hard as the original iron tubs, the plastic alternatives have improved over the years and provide great flexibility for designers.
sleeve-cartridges have a hollow stem that rotates inside  a metal or plastic sleeve to control the water flow in both one- and two-handle
with the exception of quarry tile, terra-cotta, and some porcelains and  mosaics, most tiles come glazed.
island hoods are typically installed at least 27 inches above the cook surface so they do not interfere with sight lines.
where irregularities in the substrate or tile shape, such as handmade pavers, require a setting bead thicker than 1/4 inch, choose a medium-set mortar or an all-purpose thinset approved for medium-set usage.
other tile substrates used in remodeling
notches range from about 3/16 inch for thin tile to 3/8 inch for tiles 12x12 inches and larger or irregular tiles such as handmade pavers.

these finishes are easy to apply and do not need stripping for touch-up reapplication.
with large-capacity exhaust fans of 200 cfm or greater, there is a risk of causing backdrafting of a fireplace or atmospherically vented boiler, furnace, or water heater.
tough stains as well as minor scratches or burns can be buffed out of a matte finish with an abrasive cleanser and scotch-brite pad, or wet sanded with very fine sandpaper (start with 1000-grit and use coarser grits as needed).
tubs are the same as described above.
use of doormats and frequent sweeping to remove abrasives from the floor will help prolong the finish.
if homeowners use abrasive cleansers and pads, over time the finish will dull.
these dense, thick tiles have through-color, making them very durable and suitable for heavy traffic as well as wet or exterior applications.
the most effective  way to remove the moisture and contaminants from a cooktop is with an overhead  range hood vented to the outdoors.
with gravity flush toilets, it is harder for designers to achieve a sufficient head of water without the height of a standard tank, although redesigning other components has overcome this in at least some models.
light-colored glazes tend to be harder than dark  colors and conceal scratches better.
competing with cement backerboard, gypsum products such as georgia pacific’s dens-shield® are designed as tile substrates for damp areas.
the optimal location of grab bars will  depend on the users’ specific needs, such as whether they will be sitting  or standing and which types of movements they can and cannot perform.
for joints wider than 1/2 inch, special grout with coarser sand is recommended.
offset the upper layer so the  joints do not line up with the joints in the lower layer or the joists.
plus, many cup hinges have a convenient  “snap-on” feature that allows removal of the door without tools.
if  loads are likely to exceed these, upgrade to a stronger shelf (see table 5-11,  page 186).
it will not etch but has a tendency to warp when wet, so it should not be installed in wet areas or exposed to standing water when cleaned.
now is also the time to pack fresh grout into any voids you discover and clean the grout out of any “soft joints” that are to be filled with sealant.
the minimum work aisle with counters or appliances on both sides should be 40 inches.
with nonvitreous tiles, which soak up moisture, it is best to mist or sponge the tiles just before grouting so the grout will cure properly.
floor space at shower in accessible baths
storage located from about 20 to 44 inches is considered optimal.
cultured marble, for  example, which uses crushed limestone as a filler, is relatively soft and  porous and needs to be protected by a gel coat.
on tiled walls, protect the wood framing from water intrusion, using either 6-mil poly or 15-pound asphalt-impregnated felt lapped to shed water.
with a side-by-side unit, provide easy access to a counter from the fresh food side ( figure 6-7).
the most durable type of tub, enameled cast iron, has limited offerings and  are very heavy so they are not often used.
where the problem persists,  consider added an anti sweat valve (beacon valves) that tempers the incoming  cold water with a little bit of hot water to bring it up to room temperature.
if the slab has cracks or control  joints, a crack isolation membrane should be used (seeisolation membranes).
sealing is generally done before grouting.
downdraft fans are either flush-mounted at counter level or pop up about 8 inches at the back of the range.
antiscald protection advice for bathrooms protect all tubs and showers with a pressure-balancing valve or  thermostatically controlled valve to limit water temperatures at a faucet or  showerhead to 120°f or less.
bakers like the cool, smooth surface for handling dough.
the installed showerhead will be  4 to 6 inches lower.
natural lighting for kitchens the combined area of windows and skylights should equal at least 10% of the  square footage of the kitchen.
nevamar decorative surfaces www.nevamar.com pionite decorative surfaces www.pionite.com
upgrading to  23/32- inch plywood will stiffen the subfloor by almost 80% and provide a more  solid feeling floor.
generally mosaics are mounted in  sheets and should be installed with latex-modified thinset mortar (figure 6-30).
a rule of thumb for high-output ranges is 1 cfm of ventilation per 100  btu’s of output.
look for units with staggered burners for easier access to back burners.
work aisles and passageways in accessible kitchen design clear space at doorways and passageways must be at least 32 inches wide and  no more than 24 inches long in the direction of travel.
mounting procedures for sink fixtures (faucets) most kitchen and bath sinks are self-rimming and sit on top of the counter  surface.
larger spaces also allow for greater storage, such as a linen closet, within the bathroom space.
the home ventilating institute (hvi) recommends that a fan be left on for 20 minutes after use of a bath or shower to remove all excess moisture from the room and ductwork.
on the plus side, acrylic has good noise dampening characteristics and can  tolerate bleach when needed for a difficult stain.
although it will not burn or scorch,  placing hot pots directly on the surface can cause surface damage from the  thermal shock.
unvented range hoods offer no protection against moisture and combustion gases and provide only minimal protection against grease, smoke, and odors trapped by the filter.
cultured marble, solid surfacing, engineered stone, and most other composites used in kitchen and bath counters, sinks, and wall panels are different types of cast polymer.
interior grades, typically used in cabinets, use urea-formaldehyde resin.
alternately, provide 15 inches of countertop directly across from the refrigerator and no more than 48 inches away.
kitchens produce particulates and atomized grease from cooking, and with a gas range, they also produce combustion by-products including nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide.
a simple approach is to tile the access panel, hang it with magnets, and  caulk the joint between the access panel and surrounding tiles.
the toughest finishes are available only on prefinished flooring, but seams  between the boards could allow water to penetrate if exposed to standing water  (seefloor, wood finishes).
most substrates can be used with  either organic mastic or thinset mortar, but the installer should always check  the adhesive label for compatibility with the substrate.
joints should be  taped and one coat of joint compound applied to joints and nails.
wall tiles are typically 1/4  inch thick and range in size from 4x4 to 12x12 inches.
plywood resists water damage.
size: provide a minimum clear floor space inside the  shower stall of 34x34 inches, preferably 36x36 inches or larger.
green links show where you are in a  document series or at this website.
mastic  should be avoided in applications subject to high temperatures.
for example, granite agglomerates are harder than marble agglomerates, and  the polish on granite can withstand greater abrasion and last longer.
generally mosaics are mounted in sheets and should be installed with latex-modified thinset mortar (figure 6-30).
kitchens and bathrooms are key sources of indoor moisture and other pollutants.
guide to using kitchen or bath tile sealers please see floor tile sealers, ceramic/stone for  the detailed, illustrated version of this section.
because they are farther  from the cooktop and subject to passing air currents, they require more  powerful fans than standard wall-mounted hoods.
while not as strong as cement backerboard, gypsum-based backerboard installs faster since it cuts and installs like drywall.
one side benefit to this approach is less sweating in hot weather, since only a portion of the water in the tank is replaced with new cold water.
for a successful installation, the structure underneath must be very stiff.
although this is allowed by code, it is neither safe nor convenient for the homeowners.
for optimal ventilation, locate the exhaust grilles near the source to be ventilated, typically over the tub or shower.
many manufacturers make a  tapered model designed to replace a standard 30x60â€“inch tub.
the minimum walkway shown in front of the sink may not allow full accessibility  (seefigure 6-16).
for best results, follow  recommendations of the stone supplier and use products with an established  track record.
in some cases, the room will need to be enlarged to accommodate a roll-in shower or to allow room for wheelchair users to reverse direction.
all pavers should be set with a thinset adhesive.
it  can be scratched with a knife, however, or scorched with a hot pot.
in new construction bathrooms, cultured marble is the leading material for lavatory sinks, while the more expensive vitreous china leads in remodels.
these are less slippery when wet than  polished granite.
glazes provide decorative color and protect the surface of porous tiles  from absorbing water and stains.
most solid surface sinks have a matte finish, which is easier to maintain than a semi gloss or high-gloss.
it is also vulnerable to petroleum based chemicals and heat, for example from a hot skillet.
the other has dry polymers blended into the dry mix at the factory so only water is added on site.
well-made cabinets feature sturdy cabinet boxes and drawers, stiff shelves that  resist sagging, and solid hardware that operates smoothly.

floor substrates for ceramic tile: concrete, cement backerboard, plywood,  drywall, plaster ceramic tile can be installed over clean and sound concrete, plywood,  cement backerboard, drywall, or plaster.
its main advantages are high durability and imperviousness to heat and water.
where greater stiffness is required in a  floor, it is worth the effort to also glue the underlayment to the subfloor and  upgrade from nails to screws.
many organizations advocate setting water heaters to no more than  120°f, which gives bathers significantly more time to move away or adjust  the temperature before a burn occurs.
although the first low-flow gravity toilets had trouble, many of the newer models have been re engineered with higher tanks and larger trapways to improve the flush.
a quality ceramic tile job starts with proper framing to support the tile and the selection of tile materials that are right for the application and compatible with each other.
porcelain tile is available unglazed or glazed with a matte or high-gloss finish, and comes in a wide variety of sizes, colors, and shapes.

some  manufacturers will customize jet locations.
doors and passageways for accessible bathrooms clear space at doorways and passageways should be at least 32 inches wide  and no more than 24 inches long in the direction of travel.
glazed tiles will not stain, and tiles rated for use on floors and counters are very scratch resistant.
also, screws in the upper layer, which serves as underlayment for the tile,  should penetrate the subfloor only and not the joists.
the downside is that nonglossy surfaces are somewhat harder to keep clean.
often called  “plastic laminate,” high-pressure laminate is composed of layers of  resin-saturated kraft paper with a clear melamine finish.
the sheen, however, can be restored with a thin coat of auto wax or gel  gloss (tr industries).
the pump comes with a cord and plug that requires a gfci-protected  receptacle.
a typical installation with two elbows and 20 to 30 feet of duct reduces the rated airflow of a standard fan by anywhere from 10 to 30%.

one formulation uses a latex or  acrylic liquid added to the dry mix at the job site.
in toilet areas,  install one grab bar behind the toilet and one on the side wall closest to the  toilet.
nonporous tiles that absorb little water will perform better in wet  applications than porous tiles.
most  did not work well and required two and sometimes three flushes, negating much  of the benefit to water conservation.
a  simple test is to try to operate the controls with a closed fist.
for thicker applications, let the first layer dry before adding more, or fill lower areas with plywood shims before adding the compound.
a larger water heater may also be needed.
with this type, it is important to make sure that the  bearing points fall on joists or solid blocking.
in humid areas with cold incoming water, sweating on the outside of the  porcelain tank can be a significant problem, in some cases rotting the flooring  around the toilets.

provide a minimum of 3 inches of countertop frontage on one side of a  secondary sink and at least 18 inches on the other side.
tile and grout are fairly unforgiving of movement in the substrate.
to simplify  transfers, leave as much free space on one side of the toilet as possible ( figure 6-23).
with each flush,  a partial vacuum is created in the chamber, which connects to the trapway with  tubing.
well-made cultured marble, however, treated  with reasonable care, can provide years of satisfactory service.
locate the dishwasher adjacent to the sink or no more than 12 inches away.
ansi  standards require that dry interior tiles be evenly covered over at least 80%  of their surface area (figure 6-39).
space planning revolves around the main fixtures and their required  clearances.
flush-mounted fans are typically located in the center of  the cooktop or to one side.
still, for function and economy, steel is hard to beat.
stone tiles typically measure  from 3/8 to over 1 inch thick, making some 12-inch square tiles weigh over 10  pounds.
locate with the center 26 inches  above the floor, about 8 inches forward from the front of the toilet.
this creates an attractive, continuous work surface  that is easy to wipe clean.
the nonporous surface resists mildew and most stains and is easily cleaned with nonabrasive cleaning agents.
porcelain tile characteristics porcelain tile is fired at high temperatures, creating a dense and strong  material that is impervious to water absorption.
while cultured marble is stronger and less brittle than natural marble, it is less impact-resistant and scratch resistant than other cast polymers such as solid surfacing.
the leading choices for kitchen and bath flooring installed in new homes  are sheet vinyl and ceramic tile, chosen for their durability, ease of  maintenance, and tolerance of water (figure 6-28 and figure 6-29).
the result is a lustrous and thick acrylic finish with  excellent durability.
test results on individual models performed by the national association of home builders, consumer reports, and other groups are a useful guide, but results are not consistent due to differing test methods.
high-arch or gooseneck designs are often a good solution (seefigure 6-48).
in smaller baths, a single, central exhaust point is usually adequate, while in larger baths, multiple smaller fans (or a remote fan with separate pickups) will be more effective.
if the cold water fails or the tempered water is still too hot for any reason, the unit will shut off the flow.
to ensure good airflow, follow these guidelines: use smooth ductwork of the same size or slightly larger  than the fan outlet.
locate the dishwasher within 36 inches of the sink and allow at least 21 inches of clearance between the dishwasher and any counters, cabinets, or appliances placed at a right angle to the dishwasher.
also many  lower-quality cabinets use the drawer front as the front of the drawer box, a  weaker detail.
in general, mastics are the least expensive setting material and provide the least strength and flexibility.
the most common countertop materials and their characteristics  are shown intable 6-8.
to ensure good airflow, follow these guidelines: condensation in ductwork is also a concern in cold climates.
with a  side-by-side unit, provide easy access to a counter from the fresh food side ( figure 6-7).
these must be stripped of any sealers or waxes and scarified with a coarse sander before applying the new adhesive.
and although good quality stainless is tough to damage, it is not  indestructible.
special hinges are available for nearly every door  configuration and self-closing types eliminate the need for magnetic or  mechanical catches.
it has very low absorption, but some types, especially the popular swirl types (technically called gneiss), are subject to staining if not sealed.
conflicting kitchen entry, appliance, cabinet doors all entry doors, appliance doors, and cabinet doors should swing freely  without interfering with another door.
to make a bathroom fully functional for wheelchair users and other seated  occupants requires commonsense changes, such as using universal controls and  placing them within reach, as well as some significant changes, such as  lowering sinks and providing knee space below.
stone tiles typically measure from 3/8 to over 1 inch thick, making some 12-inch square tiles weigh over 10 pounds.
the minimum ventilation rate for kitchens required by the 2003 international residential code is 100 cfm intermittent or 25 cfm continuous (if part of a whole-house ventilation system).
to insure longevity, use brass closet bolts, nuts, and washers rather than the plated steel that is often packaged with the toilet.
a casual seating area adjacent to the  kitchen work space allows other family members or friends to visit and  socialize with the cook.
waxing and special coatings may help protect the polished finish, but frequent stripping and reapplication can, by itself, cause excessive wear.
to avoid tile cracks caused by tight-fitting plywood joints, it is best to  use square-edged subflooring under tile and leave an 1/8-inch gap between  sheets (unless the setting material specifications require tight joints).
because of the mixing requirements and faster setup,  skilled applicators are required.

granite is a hard, granular igneous rock that contains mostly quartz and feldspars and ranges in color from pink and red to light or dark gray or a mix of these.
clean until just a light haze remains, which can be wiped off with a  damp rag when the grout is dry.
in  addition to stopping water, cpe membranes act as an isolation membrane,  protecting the tile and grout from movement in the substrate (see  “isolation membranes,” p. 237).
since  most surface sealers are not suitable for food contact, quarry tile is not a  good choice for counters where staining is a concern.
the company also  adds an antimicrobial compound to the gel coat to inhibit the growth of  bacteria and mold.
also, it is best if the toilet sits on top of the finished flooring rather than having a dirt-trapping joint where the finished floor abuts the fixture.
as with all tile products, check the  label for instructions.
these materials are described in  greater detail below.
the porcelain finish is durable but not indestructible.

most are built in place over a mortar bed with a  waterproof membrane liner.
however, some  frameless cabinets now offer more traditional wooden doors that leave a narrow  band of the cabinet fronts exposed.
typical installations include: regular 1/2-inch drywall over 2x4 framing or steel studs 16 inches on-center is a suitable substrate for dry installations.
the toughest finishes are available only on prefinished flooring, but seams between the boards could allow water to penetrate if exposed to standing water (seefloor, wood finishes).
scratches and damage are difficult to repair, however.
the least expensive is a postformed counter with either a seamless square edge or raised dripless edge.
tile membranes for wet areas, bathrooms, showers full waterproofing is required in construction that must retain water, such  as shower pans and tiled tubs.
with some cabinet lines, it is possible to order plywood sides only where needed, for example, on the sink base and wherever there is an exposed end panel, which might be subject to wetting or the occasional dent or nick.
when selecting a table, pay close attention to  whether leg placement will interfere with the number of chairs planned.

this is particularly  important with tile 12x12 inches or larger.
also, the silica sand presents a respiratory hazard.
in addition to aesthetic concerns, tiles vary in strength, water absorption, scratch resistance, ease of cleaning, and slip resistance.
the newest class of cast polymer, sometimes called composite or engineered stone, uses a high percentage of quartz, quartz silica, and granite to produce a material with the hardness of natural stone and the easy maintenance of solid surfacing.
overlapping work centers where countertop areas of two work centers (e.g., sink, refrigerator, food  preparation) overlap, the minimum counter frontage between the centers should  equal the longest of the required two lengths plus 12 inches.
other thinset mortars are not strong enough when built up to that depth.
green links show where you are in a document series or at this website.
it is unaffected by heat and most chemicals and the surface  will not absorb stains, odors, or oils.
a satin finish is preferable in a high-traffic area like a kitchen, since it shows scratches less than a glossy finish.
this was typically done by covering the freshly  grouted tile with kraft paper and periodically misting or sponging the tile.
also, granite agglomerates will resist mild household acids, such as citrus juice and vinegar, while these will tend to etch marble agglomerates.
also keep any metal duct seams facing upward and slope the duct slightly toward the exterior outlet so that any condensation drains to the outside.
in general, natural stone is hard, heavy, and cold, and is unaffected by  heat and water.
clear floor spaces in front of fixtures may overlap and may include up to 12 inches deep of knee space below the sink.
however, thinset mortars are better  suited for floors and wet applications, for a modest increase in cost.
most  homeowners choose single-level models for the convenience of one-handed  control, and chrome remains the most popular finish because of its durability  and easy cleaning.
silicone or special laminate seam sealer can be used.

some tile has a special nonskid  surface made by adding an abrasive grit to the tile face or glaze.
flooring choices & suggestions for bathrooms make all bathroom flooring slip-resistant.
avoid designs with  sunken tubs or tub surrounds with steps, both of which are hazards.
the main  panel products, typically covered with a wood, melamine, or vinyl veneer, are  listed below: hardboard, sometimes referred to by the brand  masonite®, is made from compressed wood fibers and lignin or phenolic  resin.
because of its stiffness and durability, exterior plywood makes an excellent substrate for tile in relatively dry applications.
if possible, allow 30 inches of clear floor space on each side of the dishwasher so two people can work at the same time (figure 6-3).
to accommodate a seated user, below-counter knee space should be a minimum of 30 inches wide, 27 inches high in front, and 19 inches deep, with a minimum 9-inch-high toe space, which will accommodate most wheelchair footrests.

cabinet bottoms should be  rigid enough not to flex under the weight of pots and pans.
if homeowners use abrasive cleansers and pads, over time the  finish will dull.
after letting the grout “slake” for 10 minutes, which allows the ingredients to fully react, the material is remixed and ready to apply as follows, working one small area of several square feet at time (seefigure 6-40): 1.
between coats, fabricators typically reinforce tub and shower walls and floors with blocks of wood or corrugated cardboard.
many organizations advocate setting water heaters to no more than 120°f, which gives bathers significantly more time to move away or adjust the temperature before a burn occurs.
floor space requirements at bathtub in accessible bathrooms provide a minimum clear floor space of 60 inches along the length of the  tub by 30 inches deep for a parallel approach or by 48 inches deep for a  perpendicular approach.

it can be seamlessly welded to itself at joints and to under mount sinks  made of the same material.
some of the new flushing strategies alleviate the problem  somewhat: in gravity toilets that store 3 or more gallons of water  in the tank, the incoming 1.6 gallons of cold water is tempered by the retained  water in the tank.
natural stone tiles characteristics stone and agglomerate stone tiles are popular choices in kitchens and  baths due to their durability and natural beauty.
for people who shower standing, provide a minimum 36x36âinch shower with appropriate grab bars, and provide a minimum clear floor space in front, 36 inches deep by the width of the shower plus 12 inches.
while building codes limit deflection in  living spaces to l/360 under uniform loads, code-compliant floors may still  have too much flexing between joists under point loads.
vinyl is a plastic sheet material that  comes applied to a particleboard or mdf substrate, and is printed with a  wood-grain or other pattern.
nonporous tiles that absorb little water will perform better in wet applications than porous tiles.
they generally do an adequate job of capturing  combustion gases, as well as water vapor and cooking odors from pans 3 inches  or shorter.
because it is  tough and durable, mosaic tile can work well on just about any application,  including floors, shower stalls, and counters.
guide to types of kitchen or bathroom cabinet shelves shelves in cabinets range from 1/2 -inch particleboard, which will bow  under the weight of dishes, to 3/4 -inch plywood.
most stains can be wiped away with a nonabrasive pad and mild cleanser, although bleach is ok if needed.
avoid the cheapest sinks, which use lightweight steel (20 to 23 gauge), as  they can flex or dent; also avoid low-nickel alloys, such as 18-8, which can  tarnish.
a waterproof joint where the counter meets the backsplash and side  splashes.
keep duct runs as short and straight as possible.
in toilet areas, install one grab bar behind the toilet and one on the side wall closest to the toilet.

in use since 1987, dens-shield® is well-suited to tub surrounds and  other light-duty wall applications, but it is not suitable for saunas, steam  rooms, or other applications facing extreme heat and humidity.
the other type of thermostatic valve is built into some high-end showers ( figure 6-54).
two layers of 19/32 inch plywood glued and screwed together on 6-inch centers is several times stiffer than a single layer (and over four times as stiff as a single layer of 23/32-inch plywood).
fifteen inches is the allowable minimum from  the centerline of toilets and bidets to a fixture or wall, while 17 to 18  inches will create a more comfortable space (figure 6-19).
manufacturers offer a wide range of setting compounds formulated for  different setting beds and conditions.
concentrated bleaches, paint strippers, or products containing  formic acid (drain cleaner) can discolor the surface.
the rim  should be sealed to the counter with silicone sealant.
if installed correctly, however, epoxy grout offers excellent protection against staining and does not require sealing.
nearly all cultured marble products are finished with a thin clear or  colored gel coat, which provides the color and pattern and creates a relatively  hard and stain-resistant skin.
where there is no backsplash, as in an island or peninsula, provide a  minimum of 9 inches behind the cooktop for safety reasons (figure 6-6).
clearances to walls.
the garbage disposal must also be offset so it does not interfere with knee space.

shower clearances & measurements for bathrooms clearances: allow a minimum 21-inch walkway (30 inches  preferred) from the front of the shower stall to a wall or fixture.
if cold water is diverted to a flushing toilet or other appliance and the pressure drops, the valve automatically reduces the hot water flow proportionately to maintain the temperature.
other options to consider are: pumps are usually located at the opposite end from the drain and fill area.
this is a simple operation, which costs about $10 to $20 for parts.
protect all tubs and showers with a pressure-balancing valve or thermostatically controlled valve to limit water temperatures at a faucet or showerhead to 120°f or less.

single-wall kitchen layout the simplest kitchen plan is designed for one cook and primarily used in  small apartments.
under mount slides have the advantage  of helping to support the drawer while remaining out of sight.
most faucet finishes are guaranteed for life.
other options to consider are: recessed jets that do not protrude individually adjustable jets, including on-off controls an in-line heater if long soaks are desired a built-in cleaning system to keep the internal plumbing  free from mold and other residues.
the inline type of valve, also called a  tempering valve, adds cold water to the hot water as it leaves the water heater  to maintain a constant temperature, set by the installer.
the concrete should be properly cured, be level to 1/4 inch in 10 feet, and have a steel trowel or fine broom finish.

closely follow manufacturers instructions, which vary a little from product  to product.
select grade 3 or higher where scratching of the tile surface is a concern.
many bathrooms are wired so that all the lights go out if a gfci is tripped.
jets high and on the sides will provide swirling water, while jets placed where bathers will sit and directed toward the back and other stress points will provide a more effective massage.
hardwood, too, has become popular in kitchens as kitchens have evolved into primary centers for recreation and socializing.
the advertised airflow of bath fans is typically based on a static pressure of 0.1 (inches of water gauge) although some also publish the airflow rating at 0.25 inches, which gives a better estimate of actual airflow in most installations.
in general, this will work where cracks are less than 1/8 inch wide, and there  is no vertical movement.
look for a durable double interlock hose that will not kink.

catalyzed enamel paint is a less  expensive option that uses a two-part formula to achieve a similar lacquer like  finish.
mount wall cabinet doors at the bottom of the cabinets and base cabinet  pulls at the top of the cabinets.
while the traditional american kitchen developed around three main  appliancesâ€”the sink, range, and  refrigeratorâ€”today’s kitchen may have many more centers  of activity, including the following list adapted from the national kitchen and  bath association (nkba): primary clean-up center: includes the main sink,  dishwasher, recycling center, and waste disposer.
also provide a minimum 30x48-inch clear floor space (preferably 48x48 inches) in front of the toilet or bidet.
more sizes,  including special heights and depths, are often available.
before installing a toilet, examine it for manufacturing defects that can cause leaks or prevent it from sealing fully to the closet flange.
it is used on door and drawer fronts and occasionally on side panels.
the gypsum core is treated with silicone to make it water-resistant, and  the fiberglass and acrylic facing acts as a surface vapor barrier.
small imperfections in size due to the high firing temperatures give it a less formal look than standard tiles.
in general, natural stone is hard, heavy, and cold, and is unaffected by heat and water.
irregular-shaped handmade tiles
avoid oil-based soaps as they tend to darken grout.
polished marble is suitable  for walls or bathroom floors, but the polish will generally not hold up well on  kitchen floors or countertops due to wear and tear and mild acid spills.
one exception is a  corner-recessed tall tower if knee space is planned to one side.
if this is a concern, look for a unit with flexible hoses connected to the pump, which helps reduce the vibration and noise transmitted to the tub.
use of thermostatic mixing valves to avoid scalding burns these are more expensive than pressure-balancing valves and not widely used  in the united states.
a hand-held  shower is always an option.

how well a particular fan can overcome the ductwork’s resistance to airflow is highly variable and is indicated by its fan curve, available from the manufacturer.
for joints wider than 1/2 inch, special grout with coarser sand is  recommended.
also, every work surface should be well illuminated by appropriate task or general lighting.
in remodeling, tiles can be successfully installed over existing ceramic  tile, plastic laminate, or resilient flooring (except the cushioned type) that  is well bonded.
the metal will tarnish, however, when the coating eventually wears off or where it gets scratched.
modified-epoxy mortar and grout system for floor tile installation epoxy mortar for flooring is generally used for floors and countertops that  require moderate chemical resistance, or where higher bond strength is needed  to withstand greater loading, impacts, and flexing.
the company literature claims that the surface is more durable and slip resistant than standard porcelain enamel and that the composite layer helps retain heat.
handmade paver tiles may come prefinished or require sealing by the  installer with either a surface coating or penetrating sealer to provide a wear  surface.
toilets and bidet layout & clearances for bathrooms clearances.
most fall into one of the categories described below: glazed ceramic tile properties the most common type of tile, glazed ceramic tile, is usually marketed as  either a wall or floor tile, depending on the hardness and water-absorption of  the underlying clay body of the tile or bisque.
downdraft fans for kitchens because they lack a canopy to catch contaminants and must overcome natural  convection, downdraft fans are less effective than overhead range hoods.
also pay  attention to jet locations.
some hoods are rated as low as 2.5 sones, although most range from 4 to 7 sones at full power (one sone roughly equals the sound of one quiet refrigerator).
serving center: this area stores dishes and other serving  items and may be in the kitchen or closer to the dining area.

apply the thinset with the flat side of a 1/4 -inch notched  trowel, then rake with the notched side to provide a continuous level setting  bed.
installation should be  with thinset adhesive.
seating in shower stalls: shower stalls should include a  bench or seat that is 17 to 19 inches high and a minimum of 15 inches deep.
cultured marble is commonly used for vanity tops with integral sinks, as well as shower and tub enclosures, but it is rarely used for kitchen counters.
granite is stained  by oil and grease, however.
the subflooring should be level to 1/8 inch in 10 feet.

a rule of thumb for high-output ranges is 1 cfm of ventilation per 100 btu’s of output.
one formulation uses a latex or acrylic liquid added to the dry mix at the job site.
if joint cleaning  is rushed, the grout pulls out and smears the tile; too much delay causes it to  harden before you can shape the joints.
the tile bisques manufactured according to ansi standards are rated from nonvitreous to impervious (seetable 6-4).
because the material has little inherent strength, it relies on the structure beneath for stiffness when used on floors and other applications subject to significant loads.
if all these products are installed following the manufacturer’s instructions as well as the specifications of the tile council of america (tca), the result should be an attractive and durable job.
many manufacturers now rate the abrasion resistance of their tile using the guidelines of the porcelain enamel institute (pei).
these may not work with low-flow designs, however.
handmade pavers, on the other hand, tend to be relatively soft, unglazed, nonvitreous tiles, so they are not suitable for wet interior applications or outdoors in areas subject to freeze/thaw cycles.
a less expensive option is to combine tiled walls with a one-piece fiberglass or acrylic shower pan (not to be tiled).
reinforce inside and outside  corners with three pieces of 2-inch tape or one piece of 4-inch tape.
most  cartridges are easy to replace, but some faucets require a special tool to pry  out the cartridge.

(list adapted with permission from john wiley & sons from  essential kitchen design guide, © nkba, 1996.)
ball valves last a long  time, and replacement parts are inexpensive (under $10), but the small parts  can be tricky to assemble.
most substrates can be used with either organic mastic or thinset mortar, but the installer should always check the adhesive label for compatibility with the substrate.
undersized or poor quality hinges, on the other hand, can lead to sagging or  rubbing doors and are a common problem with low-end cabinets.
expansion joint requirements in tile surfaces tile and grout are fairly unforgiving of movement in the substrate.
for example, choose only nonskid flooring types and select  tub and shower controls with foolproof antiscald protection.
natural stone has become as popular as solid surfacing in the past few years as stone prices have dropped and finished stone slabs have become more widely available.
so it does not interfere with knee space (figure 6-15).
while granite holds its polish longer than marble and is not bothered by mild acids, such as orange juice or vinegar, over time the traffic on a kitchen floor will dull the finish.
a drop-in requires a custom-built surround and requires more floor space (seefigure 6-52).
although a ceramic tile installation is not completely waterproof without the addition of a waterproofing membrane, the tile itself, along with the cement backerboards and thinset mortars used in quality installations, are unaffected by water.
leave a 1/8 -inch gap between  sheets and make sure the edges of adjacent plywood sheets are no more than 1/32  inch out of plane.
many tile manufacturers use a coefficient of friction (cof) to rate the  traction a tile provides.

one that  swings out of the way can increase the useful space.
a simple preliminary test can be done by holding a stick of incense next to the draft diverter or dilution port of each combustion appliance with the furnace fan on and off.
if the tiles are nonvitreous and unglazed, as with handmade  pavers, they may need to be sealed prior to grouting to prevent staining.
provide a minimum clear floor space of 60 inches along the length of the tub by 30 inches deep for a parallel approach or by 48 inches deep for a perpendicular approach.
space planning revolves around the main fixtures and their required clearances.
the most common stones are marble and granite, since they both can take  a high polish.
one good indication of overall durability is  certification by the kitchen cabinet manufacturers association, which has a  rigorous testing and certification program that measures such things as  structural integrity, shelf strength, hardware durability, and quality of  finishes.
high-quality drawers typically have solid hardwood or poplar sides  and backs, with minimum 1/4 -inch plywood bottoms glued into dados.
rabbeted or partial-overlay doors are the easiest to fit and adjust since they have considerable play.
bath fan noise issues the biggest homeowner objection to bath fans, their noise, has been  addressed with the introduction of whisper-quiet bath fans from a number of  manufacturers.
he optimal height for most seated occupants at counters, sinks, and cooktops is about 32 inches and should be no higher than 34 inches.
most seated users can fully reach shelving located from 15 to 48 inches high.
although access to the mechanicals is rarely needed, it should not require tearing apart the tile surround.
if using a postformed counter with a miter joint, it is essential to mechanically draw the joint tight and to seal that joint to prevent water intrusion, which will degrade the particleboard and open the joint.
quarry tile characteristics originally made from quarried stone, quarry tiles are typically unglazed,  semivitreous or vitreous tiles made from extruded slabs of clay or shale.
if a bath has more than one vanity, set one at 30 to 34 inches and the other at  34 to 42 inches high.
a few tubs are designed with individual bearing points molded into the  bottom of the tub.
for a higher degree of stain-resistance as well as moderate resistance to some chemicals, epoxy grout is a good option for applications such as showers, bathroom floors, or heavily used kitchen counters.
for most seated users, the recommended sink height is 32 inches (figure 6-21 ).
walkways with counters or appliances on only one side can be 36  inches wide, but if a walkway turns a corner, as infigure 6-1 , one leg should  be widened to 42 inches for a wheelchair to make the turn.
this was typically done by covering the freshly grouted tile with kraft paper and periodically misting or sponging the tile.
many “builders’ grade” lavatory sinks are undersized for basic grooming tasks, such as tooth brushing and face washing without splashing water across the vanity top.
a wide variety of proprietary sealers are available to protect natural stone against staining from grout, dirt, foods, and household products.
while tca specs allow 15/32-inch plywood  underlayment over a 19/32 inch subfloor in residential work, upgrading to 19/32  inch underlayment is recommended for a trouble-free floor (figure 6-32).
bathroom ventilation design recommendations bathroom ventilation should be powerful enough to remove excess moisture  before it has time to condense on cold walls and windows, potentially damaging  finishes, or escape into wall or ceiling cavities, where it may lead to decay  or peeling paint.
