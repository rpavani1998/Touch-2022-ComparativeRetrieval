grow boxes and training pots 3 posted june 16, 2006 by will  heath intechniques common procedures for developing a bonsai from seedlings or young stock  involve first ground or grow box growth during which the plant undergoes many  trunk chops and cut backs of branching to encourage back budding and to add  movement to the trunk as well as developing taper.
in the following article i will separate the two and explain in detail the uses of both.
ramification and finer development can also be started while the tree is in a training pot.
not to mention bringing growing conditions as close to actual  ground growing as possible.
with collected trees this also holds true.
later, once the growers’ goals are met concerning the trunk, taper,  and movement, the plant is transferred to a training pot to define the nebari  and create finer “feeder” roots while accustoming the plant to a  container.
finer root development can be obtained by using a pot with screened sides and bottom.
photograph by vance wood grow boxes are typically slightly oversized pots or boxes used for the  expressed purpose of obtaining faster growth, trunk and root development than  would be unobtainable in a regular bonsai pot.
training pots once the trunk thickness, nebari, and branching have been achieved in a  grow box, it is time to more the tree into a training pot so that it can  develop the fine root system it will need to survive life in a bonsai pot.
multiple sacrifice branches  are encouraged in order to thicken the trunk.

can redwood fencing be used for grow box materials?reply

these are available made exclusively for this purpose or you could also use pond baskets, which are not as attractive but work in basically the same way and are available at low prices at most pond stores and box stores in the pond department.
i personally use self adhesive drywall mesh for this purpose and it comes in a roll, can be easily cut to size, will not decompose, and it inexpensive.

i recently built a deck around my pool using plastic lumber which saws, nails, and screws just like wood, but will never rot.
these come in various sizes  and are quite inexpensive; the 2-gallon size shown was purchased for under a  dollar.
once the roots colonize the new soil, if more growth is required, the plant can be slipped potted into a larger container without distributing the roots or, if the desired results have been obtained, it can be moved into a training pot.
the answer is no because pots are just not like the ground, the drainage and water retention are not the same.
i know that the common response to this practice is the question that if plants grow the best in the ground, wouldn’t it best to try and duplicate that environment in a super sized pot with lots of excess soil.
for further reading on this subject i would recommend two of brent walstons’ excellent articles, “overpotting” and “ why the earth is not like a pot“.
photograph by vance wood sometimes the development of the trunk and nebari in collected stock and  nursery stock is already at an advanced state and the grow box step can be  skipped altogether so that the tree can be placed directly into a training pot.

a grow box that is a few inches bigger than the root mass is all that is needed.
illustration by will heath you can get as fancy as you wish; one club member cuts his end pieces taller and cuts ovals for handles on the top.
another nice feature of vance’s pots is that the bottom is not fastened in and can be pushed upwards which makes removing the root mass a breeze.
during this period ramification and final branch placement are also begun.
a grow box should be only a few inches wider at most than the root mass of the plant being put into it.
i leave spaces between the bottom boards for drainage.
excellent guidance thank you…………reply great article!
grow boxes are also used to place freshly collected stock into in order for  the plant to recover and become accustomed to life out of the ground while  waiting for it to become strong enough to begin training.
being shallow, they help to create the nebari we  desire in bonsai.
the grow box is used instead of a training pot to accompany the larger root mass in need of fine feeder roots which is typical of collected trees.
the root tips that reach the light  through the screen stop growing, which allows resources to be redirected to  other roots deeper within the soil and closer to the trunk, creating excellent  ramification of the roots and creating a mass of fine feeder roots.
they can be buried for winter if needed and like the wooden framed pot, has excellent drainage all around.

the fine root systems that result from the use of screen sided training pots has convinced me never to use anything else.
this period of allowing growth  and then cutting it back is continued until the desired trunk size, taper, and  movement are achieved.
a common misconception is that the larger the container, the faster and better the growth, this is a myth and actually could be more detrimental in the long run due to the fact that the massive amount of excess soil surrounding the root ball may never get the chance to dry out.
once  the roots colonize the new soil, if more growth is required, the plant can be  slipped potted into a larger container without distributing the roots or, if  the desired results have been obtained, it can be moved into a training pot.

finer root development can be obtained by using a pot with screened sides  and bottom.
they start out seedlings in very small pots and then once the roots fill  the container, they move it up into the next size pot and then once the roots  have filled this, they move it one size up again.
finally, the plant is transferred into bonsai pot where it will spend  the remainder of its lifetime.

you gave me a lot of information with plenty of explanation!reply great info-
for more information on brent walston, who is certainly the leading authority on growing and developing stock for bonsai in the united states, you can see an in-depth interview atartofbonsai.org as mentioned above, almost any container will work as a grow box as long as it is not too large, typically 2 to 3 inches of new soil around the root mass is plenty, any more and you risk the overall health of the tree.
for further reading on this subject i would recommend two of  brent walstons’ excellent articles, “overpotting” and “ why the earth is not like a pot“.
as the roots are usually damaged slightly and feeder roots are low in numbers, it is important not to place them in a overly large soil mass.
whatever your material or design, keep a few boxes of varying sizes handy  and material to create a custom sized box when the need arises.
although grow boxes and training pots are often considered as the same thing, they serve two completely different purposes.

vance’s redwood pots are very attractive they look great around the yard and both his pots and pond baskets work better than any other training pots i have used.

considering that nurseries make their  profit selling plants and that they can sell bigger stock for more money than  small stock, you must admit that they have to get stock to grow as quickly as  humanly possible.
a grow box that is a few inches bigger than the  root mass is all that is needed.
i hope that i have successfully explained the differences between a grow  box and a training pot as well as clearly explained the uses and advantages of  both.
the scraps from the deck have given me material for many grow boxes.
i wire two long and narrow blocks to the bottom to act as feet so that air can circulate underneath the pot and so water can drain out of the screened bottom better.
the addition of feet are not necessary with vance  wood’s planters shown above, as the bottom screen is already designed to  be off of the surface of the bench.
screen  sided pots help in root development and they effectively prevent the circling  of roots common in all other types of pots.

growing in the ground will achieve these results quicker yet some people do not have the space to maintain a growing bed so grow boxes are a substitute and are the next best thing.
the common denominator is using a container  that will allow good drainage, root ramification, and that is reasonably  affordable.
these are quickly becoming very popular  with bonsai enthusiasts everywhere.

grow boxes growing or grow boxes can be defined as any container that will allow free,  almost unrestricted growth of a plant in order to increase the size of the  trunk, root mass, branch numbers, and/or height of the tree.

many people use basic garden center plastic liners, larger bonsai pots and such for training pots however, these do little for fine root development and are not usually recommended.
the typical wooden box is most likely the most efficient and attractive, but i  have seen dish washing pans, dresser drawers, small tires, large nursery pots,  large bonsai pots, azalea pots, cooking pans, produce boxes, and tupperware  containers used for this purpose.

if you think about how nurseries grow stock in pots this will make more sense.
not to mention bringing growing conditions as close to actual ground growing as possible.

a grow box should be only a few  inches wider at most than the root mass of the plant being put into it.
any type of screen that is bigger than  window screen and will not rust can be used over the slats to prevent your soil  mix from falling through.
i personally prefer using wooden boxes as shown above for this purpose as they are shallow, easily built to size from inexpensive materials, lightweight, and relatively attractive.
i have had  excellent results with screen sided pots.

since collected trees usually take awhile before fully participating in the transfer of water out of the soil, having to big of a pot and thereby, too much soil, can lead to an overly wet environment.

although, for simplicity and  clarity, i have used the term “grow boxes” in this article, the  term is used here to encompass all oversized containers that can be used for  the purposes outlined.
