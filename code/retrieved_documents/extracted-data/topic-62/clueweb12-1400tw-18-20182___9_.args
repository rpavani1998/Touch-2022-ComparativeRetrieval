to keep the system working optimally, add more water to the pots as needed and avoid letting them dry out completely.each pot will water the plants within its immediate area (responding to the soil moisture tension around it).this will slowly release the water into the soil, reducing the need for soaker hoses.keep the mouth of the jar covered to prevent insects and debris from getting inside and to help reduce water loss through evaporation.since the pots are buried, water is delivered more efficiently at root level rather than above the soil surface (with water needing to travel a few inches down to reach the roots).it’s a new concept to me but this method has apparently been around for centuries yet still offers value to today’s gardener.this method can be used in container gardening as well, you’ll just need to use smaller clay pots that will fit inside the containers or planter boxes leaving enough room for the plants to thrive.as the soil dries, suction develops and the water slowly seeps out from inside the pot and into the soil around it (the suction force is created by soil moisture tension and/or plant roots themselves,source).this is a naturally automatic system, if it’s been raining, the soil is wet so there is no moisture tension and the pots don’t release any water.bonus: because the soil is kept moist inches below the soil surface, this helps reduce the growth of weeds (also means less water consumption and less maintenance).the larger the pot you use, the larger the area it covers (and the less often you have to top it up with water).they advise painting the top of the olla with white paint to reduce evaporation (top part of the jar will be exposed to the sun).the soil gets just what it needs, right when it needs it with no gadgets or sensors required!there is no moisture tension and the pots don’t release any water.they also show a diy using regular clay flowerpots attached to each other using waterproof gorilla glue and silicon caulking.
