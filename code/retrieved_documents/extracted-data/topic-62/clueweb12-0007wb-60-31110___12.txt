for foods such as beans, it is essential to turn the box at least once.
in most homemade panel or funnel cookers or box ovens, cooking is a slower, gentler process that generally takes two to five times as long, but the food tastes better, is more nutritious, and needs very little fussing (sometimes none) while cooking.
squash, zucchini: 1 hour.
pots with thin walls that conduct heat well heat up faster.
roasting nuts - bake uncovered.
make the cooker about 1" (2.5 cm) deeper than your pots are high (including lid).

this is especially helpful if the grain is either very slow to  tenderize (brown rice, hulled but not pearled barley) or gets mushy easily  (quinoa, millet).
cooking is possible with some clouds or haze, but times will be slower.
vegetables - add no water.
as for when to check on the food, if skies are clear and you haven't overloaded your cooker, check it at twice the time recommended for conventional cooking and judge accordingly.
to clear  condensation between the panes, remove the corks and allow the cooker to heat.
while there are a few things that can be overcooked in a solar  cooker (vegetables such as tender greens, broccoli, and asparagus, or soft  fruits, for example), most foods will only get more tender and flavorful.
increase cooking  times for larger amounts.
two hours for hard yolks.
if your sky conditions are less than ideal, you may have better luck if you preheat the water and grain separately, as suggested for pasta.
- for an alternative method that is much less messy and results in a smoother, better appearance, coat the relevant cooker surface with a thick but not dripping layer of white glue (a sponge brush works very well for this).
a clean black sock can be put over an ear of corn to help absorb  heat for faster cooking time.
added by tom sponheim - to achieve frying temperatures in a single reflector cooker elevate a shallow, dark pan (without a lid) so that it touches the glass inside.

the husk will hold the moisture in and protect the kernels  naturally.
added by tom sponheim - a cardboard cooker can be made water-proof using glue and wax (beeswax or candle wax): - cover the outside of the cooker with pieces of cloth that have been dipped in white glue or wheatpaste.
when fabric is  lined up and smoothed out satisfactorily, use the sponge brush to completely  cover the fabric with a generous amount of glue, making sure that the fabric is  completely saturated with glue.
blackened canning jars (use masking tape to leave a viewing strip) often cook  the fastest because of the slight pressurization.
if you are making something like a soup or stew that mixes hard vegetable (carrots or potatoes, for example) with tender ones (spinach or baby peas, for example), add the hard vegetables first.
other food can be baked at the same time in the rest of the oven.

equal pots of stew (veggies and meat cut large) and soup (veggies and meat cut smaller) might get hot at about the same rate, but the stew will take a longer time of simmering for the vegetable and meat to tenderize.
