container plantings are perfect for gardeners with limited outdoor space, and they're great for making entrances, decks, and patios feel more welcoming.a big benefit here is that perennials and even shrubs in containers will overwinter and come back bigger and better in subsequent years.the key is to choose plants for their foliage, not their flowers.the past few years i've been experimenting with containers filled mostly with plants i've divided from my garden, and while the effect may be subtle, it can be very effective.houseplants like fancy-leaved geraniums and different succulents can also work in outside containers.using a cheap plastic planter is fine, but you may want something more attractive and more permanent like terra cotta, ceramic, or metal, all of which should last for many years.stems of both these can be snapped off the parent plant and stuck directly in the dirt, where they will form roots quickly.oddly, it's actually been more fun to design containers using what i already have in the ground and in the house than what i find in the store.most perennials have a short bloom season, so the leaves need to hold the interest for the rest of the year.if you browse yard sales, flea markets and thrift shops you might find some good deals and unique containers to use as planters.you can also try evergreens as an anchor in your containers, and fill in with some small plants seasonally.as spring marches onwards, now is when gardeners look at empty pots and planters and think about what to put inside them.i plunked one of each into two containers on my neighbor's shady landing a few years ago and they're still going strong and look great.traditionally, containers gardens are designed with annuals, using something tall in the back, a trailing plant in the front, and a medium height plant with colorful flowers in the center.a few weeks ago i filled a big copper kettle from a flea market with soil and planted the top with jade plants, aloe, sedums, and echeverias that had been in different pots in the house during the winter.
