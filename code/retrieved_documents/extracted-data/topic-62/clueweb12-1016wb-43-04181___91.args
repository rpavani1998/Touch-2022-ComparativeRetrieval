astaxanthin is a wonder compound from microalgae people who pay attention to nutrition have long been impressed by the properties of the blue green pigment in marine microalgae, and have elevated spirulina and chlorella to superfood status.
dr. b: that woke me up, because in medical school i’d never heard that water could cure pain, that kind of pain, in fact.
moreover, astaxanthin helped maintain a higher mitochondria membrane potential and stimulated respiration, allowing for the production of increased levels of cellular energy.
when the blood becomes concentrated and acidic, and is being rushed through constricted arteries or capillaries, in dehydration, then abrasions and tears are produced in the arterial system, naturally, in the capillaries of the heart first.

it causes grotesque facial tumors that eventually prevent them from feeding, leading to starvation within months.
in this case we have, because all of the usual answers concerning generating energy are bound by our unspoken limitation to the surface of the earth.
they’ve found that arsenic exposure not only disrupts the immune system but also disrupts the endocrine system, causing unusually broad hormonal upheavals.
it provides the coloration for birds such as flamingoes and quail.
no substitute for water mike: i have a question for you on water — a lot of people think that they are hydrating themselves when they consume soft drinks or milk or gatorade or all these other liquid beverages… dr. b: gatorade is possibly okay, but gatorade has sugar in it, and it’s not particularly good for people who might even get hypoglycemic, or might induce insulin secretion, and that insulin secretion will produce more hunger and they overeat.
the intelligence behind the design of the body has it such that a drought management program will kick in, and then allergies are a sign of dehydration because the system that regulates water balance of the body suppresses the immune system, because it’s an energy-consuming situation.
to make solar power satellites (sps) practical and economical, we do not need any new science; we only need to apply what we are already doing in the more advanced industries: robotic production, computer control, and the replication by robotic machines of some of their heavier, simpler components.
they cited it as a potential candidate for a natural brain food.
it does not require new science, nor high temperatures, nor high energy density.

i explain how dehydration suppresses the immune system, directly or indirectly, and that’s how most diseases occur, including cancer.
because i’ve said that the heartburn is a sign of dehydration in the human body and you should drink water.
the down side to neti pots is that you have to commit to putting in the time and effort.
sick-care system survives and thrives on pushing these jargons into the minds of the people, because people don’t understand what these jargons, they hear them and they don’t associate with anything in the body, but associate them with those jargons of fear that are drummed in the minds of people.
dr. b: first and foremost, don’t wait until you get thirsty, because that’s an error.
we call these heartburn, rheumatoid joint pain, back pain, migraine headaches, colitis pain, fibromyalgiac pain, even angina pain — signs of dehydration in the body.
the central problem of industrial growth is energy.
and so i had the occasion to test water as a medication in subsequently over 3,000 similar cases.
building more energy efficient systems, especially transportation systems, is a way we can reduce energy needs.
however, studies have shown that oral supplementation works best.
we could not reduce energy use without condemning the majority of the world’s population to unending poverty.
because everyone assumes that aids is actually a viral disease, which is a fraudulent statement by those people who presented it, because the human body is the product of many, many years of having fought various viral diseases, and has survived.
that’s 10 tons (about 6 mid-size cars worth) a year for each of 10 billion people.

long before earth’s moon was harmed or depleted, industry would be moved to a large asteroid or moon in the outer solar system.
to make solar power satellites (sps) practical and economical, we do not need any new science; we only need to apply what we are already doing in the more advanced industries: robotic production, computer control, and the replication by robotic machines of some of their heavier, simpler components.
and he started beaming from ear to ear, very happy, asked me what happens if the pain comes back?
yes, but they will get the option at http://www.watercure.com to go to either site.
of course, they don’t know, they don’t do it knowingly.
for coal or nuclear the numbers are: 1,500 watts waste, 2,500 watts total; for ground-based solar they are several thousand watts waste plus another thousand to make up the total – different from an earth without solar cells – because solar cells absorb more heat than the ground they cover.
the need for these inhalers will disappear.
and we call this reduced air flow in the lungs because of dehydration, we’ve labeled it as asthma.
i explain how dehydration suppresses the immune system, directly or indirectly, and that’s how most diseases occur, including cancer.

astaxanthin is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier in mammals, a unique and important property for an antioxidant.
( journal of nutrition and biochemistry, may) astaxanthin is able to cross the blood-brain barrier to protect neurons astaxanthin’s powerful antioxidant activity has been demonstrated in studies dating back to the mid 1990′s.
all they have to do is become curious as to learn.
even to suggest there may be solutions is a “western” viewpoint, very different from the fatalism much of humankind still lives by.
mike: so this is a very easy sign that people can pay attention to.
he was a flight surgeon, he is a researcher at nasa.
and he started beaming from ear to ear, very happy, asked me what happens if the pain comes back?
antidepressant drugs are antihistamines, pain medication are antihistamines, other medications are directly and indirectly antihistamines.
it was able to restore decreased humoral immune responses in old mice, through immuno-modulating properties not related to provitamin a activity.
but when you factor in the toll that the chemicals take on your system, it`s really a lot more convenient to practice prevention.

the primary obstacle is the enormous lift costs.
very low amounts of arsenic stimulate or enhance hormone responses but at doses just slightly higher, like those found in drinking water, it appears to suppress those hormone responses.
and he was in excruciating pain, and water performed miraculous relief for him.

put six matches on a table, do not break any, and use them to make four equal triangles.
mike: you are, i’m sure the listeners would agree here, you are to be applauded for being able to venture outside of conventional medicine.
well, of course it is, and the whole entire existence of the pharmaceutical industry is based on presentation of false science, and advertising this false science and drumming it into the minds of gullible people who have no curiosity to find out why that is so.
mike: for the pharmaceutical industry, the existence of disease is a business question, because let’s face it, the pharmaceutical industry is a for-profit industry.

it’s a book that explains why dehydration is the cause of pain and disease, and how the pharmaceutical industry has camouflaged this information or covered it up and instead of letting people drink water, it advertises the use of their products, which actually do kill.
these are some of the perceptive signs of dehydration.
the driving engine for these is the desire of consumers to slow or stop the aging process, and their fondness for natural products and belief that traditional lotions and creams provide very limited benefits.
the points that seem to me most important about radio transmission of energy are that people would not be in the beams; that for fundamental physical reasons the beams could not be intentionally or accidentally redirected; that their intensity would be comparable to sunlight; that unlike the massive shielding around a nuclear reactor, the only shielding necessary would be a layer of household aluminum foil; and that, unlike the present irreversible dumping of 5,000 megatons per year of fossil-fuel carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, or the generation of long-lived nuclear wastes, the sps system would leave no chemicals or radioactives behind if our descendants decided to turn it off.
( international journal for vitamin and nutrition research, july-september, 2008) new research highlights astaxanthin’s incredible cancer fighting properties the ability of astaxanthin to inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells was studied at catholic university school of medicine in rome, italy.
but don’t worry, taking supplemental astaxanthin or eating foods that have consumed it will not cause a person to turn orange or red.
so there is a movement afoot within the nih group of people to keep a closed lid on my information so that it doesn’t get out, because obviously they are more in favor of the drug industry, because it is now obvious that they are getting paid by them.
astaxanthin keeps people feeling good too.
fibroblasts from skin were exposed to moderate doses of uva, which stimulated cell death, increased levels offree radicals and other reactive substances, decreasedantioxidant enzymes activities, and promoted membrane disturbance and enzyme denaturing of hemoglobin.
for children, they may prefer a decorative ceramic pot best to peak their interest.
it’s a book that explains why dehydration is the cause of pain and disease, and how the pharmaceutical industry has camouflaged this information or covered it up and instead of letting people drink water, it advertises the use of their products, which actually do kill.
anything that would eat it will lose its art of camouflage, its alertness, good reaction, good response, and becomes easy prey to its own food chain predator.
when it manifests pain, in fact, it is indicating dehydration.
without any help from human workers, the 100 ton factory would mine the soil around it, would manufacture spare parts to maintain and repair itself, and would manufacture enough extra parts to assemble a copy of itself in one year.
we should not wait to get thirsty, because water is the main source of energy.
take the bus from colony to colony.
histopathological examination substantiated the protective effect of astaxanthin in the pre-treated rats.
and the mechanism is very simple — when there isn’t enough water to be evenly distributed and certain parts of the body are working but not receiving enough water to deal with its toxic waste and metabolism, and the toxic waste builds up that area, the nerve endings in that area register the chemical environmental change with the brain.
it’s bad education, and we think that these soft drinks are synonymous with water.
with endless variations of climate, vegetation, and design, travel could become the main activity of the future population.
now, this is a major problem, and that’s why we have so many people in the elderly sector of our society who are sick, because they are totally dehydrated and they do not recognize it.
mike: i thank you so much for your generosity, being willing to take this time and share your wisdom with the world.
astaxanthin strongly upregulated apoptosis through gene modification, and increased phosphoylation of the p38, jnk, and erk1/2 genes by 160%, 242%, and 280% respectively.
the driving engine for these is the desire of consumers to slow or stop the aging process, and their fondness for natural products and belief that traditional lotions and creams provide very limited benefits.
more research has documented the anti-tumor activity of astaxanthin and its mode of action, as well as the contribution of its antioxidant properties to protect against cancer metastasis.
some people have extreme muscular pain, that amnesia you mentioned seems to be very common, and yet a study just came out, i saw it this morning, talking about how blueberries have phytonutrients that are shown to lower so-called fatty cholesterol, ldl cholesterol, more powerfully than statin drugs.
i was one of the last people to interview the late dr. batmanghelidj, and i listened in awe as he shared his research and stories about “the healing power of water.”
dr. b: bernard shaw says that normal people try to conform, and reasonable people do not conform, and look for alternatives.
patents are pending for the miracles of astaxanthin one of the primary producers of astaxanthin from microalgae lists patents applied for and pending on its website.
dr. b: the skin — if the skin is nice and loose and smooth, then we are hydrated.
mike: but you were trained in classic, conventional way… dr. b: i had to educate myself.
and it has to raise the blood pressure for that in order to overcome the osmotic pull of water out of the cells, and reinject water into the cells.
the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa) claims 10 parts per billion (ppb) of arsenic in drinking water is “safe”.
mike: but you were trained in classic, conventional way… dr. b: i had to educate myself.
there is already occupied and engaged water, which is no good for new function.
they found a significant decrease in the incidence of colon cancer in the animals that were given astaxanthan.
so we need to understand these symptoms of dehydration, and the book water cures, drugs kill will do that.
profits are always first, and at least it’s my belief, and it seems that you share it, that any therapy that competes with those profits is minimized, marginalized or outright attacked.
because if they’re young people, they’ve got many years to go, and unfortunately in a dishonest form of medical practice, they can become vulnerable.
astaxanthin is cited in patents pending for helicobacter infection, improvement of muscle function and disorders, hypertension, stress, and carpal tunnel syndrome.

it improves fine lines and wrinkles, skin elasticity and moisture content while reducing inflammation and cell damage that leads to premature aging.
long before earth’s moon was harmed or depleted, industry would be moved to a large asteroid or moon in the outer solar system.
nuclear power is not very cheap, and would require operating 63,000 nuclear reactors worldwide by the middle of the next century.
but the young people drank water, and corrected this dehydration.
with ample resources available, engineers would make space colonies safe from collisions and radiation, and without earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, tornadoes, or hurricanes they’d be safer than earth.
the combination of the moon’s weak gravitational grip and its vacuum environment makes it practical to locate electric mass accelerators on its surface which would be capable of lofting a steady stream of small payloads to a precise collection point high in space.
so, that is when my work was published, the scientific secretariat of the 3rd interscience board conference of inflammation invited me to make this presentation on histamine at their conference in 1989, in monte carlo.
and so i had the occasion to test water as a medication in subsequently over 3,000 similar cases.
the carotenoids also down regulated bcl-2 gene expression.
that would delay the population crisis for another 1000 years.
when there isn’t enough water in the body, or the body becomes dehydrated, 66% of the water loss is from the interior of the cells.
this allows bacteria and allergens to exit the body instead of spreading and causing infections in other areas.
but, several days later, the rodents’ immune systems produced a reaction that was too strong and too late.
because i’ve said that the heartburn is a sign of dehydration in the human body and you should drink water.
in this case we have, because all of the usual answers concerning generating energy are bound by our unspoken limitation to the surface of the earth.
of course, the conscious mind should have known that, but bad education has robbed us of that information.
because of their ability to extinguish free radicals, researchers at the university of hawaii, characterized the mechanism by which the carotenoid group works and reviewed preclinical data.
but nonetheless, people who did discover that water could cure their heartburn are wiser than those who buy into that advertising stunt.
we learn a couple of years of physiology, and soon as we go on the clinical side we are asked to forget those and begin to learn pharmacology in order to treat symptoms rather than understand the primary cause of the health problem.

indeed, those most seriously studying sps are japan and europe.
in a study just published in the journal environmental health perspectives, hamilton and his colleagues reported on their study of mice that ingested 100 ppb (parts per billion) of arsenic in theirdrinking water for five weeks and then were exposed to h1n1.
i have researched this topic extensively, and i have shown in fact that aids is a metabolic problem, when the body begins to cannibalize its own tissue because of certain missing elements in the raw materials that it receives through food or beverages, and the body of a person who gets aids, actually, is short of quite a number of building block amino acids.
even when water was left next to them, some of them wouldn’t reach for it.
people can order through the internet athttp://www.watercure.com or amazon.com or barnesandnoble.com or go to the bookstore and get it.
mike: the predominant diagnosis of this, of course, i think in the minds of most people, and especially in most m.d.s would be that there is something physically or structurally compromised in that area.
they are widespread innature and found on peanuts, wheat, corn, beans and rice.
dr. b: well, of course, the compromise is when the tissue is dehydrated, it’s changing structure.
so, we need not only correct dehydration, but also to supply the minerals and vitamins and so on so that the body can repair itself.
all of the patients were treated two times per week for three weeks, and then once per week for four weeks.
and when i contacted the nih and explained all of this, the gentleman who was in charge of this said i was so ignorant on what was going on, and yet he wanted to protect his freedom, and so he ignored the information even though i had gone to clinton, president clinton to ask him to intervene, and give breath back to these children.

(2) no matter how comfortable earth becomes, many people will want the special luxuries found in space colonies.
fusion power research has gone on in large part because governmental science agencies like the national aeronautics and space administration, the department of energy, and the national science foundation are extremely responsive to the scientific establishment.
mike: i just wanted to comment on the number of side effects that have been recorded as side effects from using statin drugs.
so that’s when i began to consider writing for the public, so that the public could become aware of the problem directly without the interference of a doctor, and that’s how i have generated all my medical information for the public.
reactors concentrate energy to an extreme degree, which is why there have been fatal reactor accidents in the real world of fallible, error-prone people.
the down side to neti pots is that you have to commit to putting in the time and effort.
the degree of cataract formation was lower than in the control group.
we are totally blind and ignorant and the pharmaceutical industry has hijacked medicine.
none of the study participants had tried acupuncture before.
very simple, and i presented this concept at the international conference as the guest lecturer of a conference on cancer, explaining that the human body manifests dehydration by producing pain, and pain is a sign of water shortage in the body, and water shortage is actually the background to most of the health problems in our society.
we are concerned enough with the rise of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect that our desire, as environmentalists, is to phase out the use of fossil fuels.

by the time you get thirsty, you will have lost energy from the water that you should have drunk and made available before you get thirsty.
the turkey neck under the chin is a sign of dehydration.
because tasmanian devils are genetically similar, their bodies do not recognize the tumors as foreign cells and do not produce an effective immune response.
when the mouth is dry we are thirsty, which is an arrogant statement, and unfortunately western medicine bought into that understanding, and that’s why we have a sick-care system, because from the age of 20 onwards, we gradually, imperceptibly become dehydrated without knowing it.
that would delay the population crisis for another 1000 years.
time is of essence — when incrementally we become dehydrated, the prune-like cells begin to transform.
a group of researchers with group health conducted the largest study on back pain andacupuncture in the united states.
mass-drivers were shown to obey their computer design programs within one percent – no new science there – just straightforward engineering.

likewise, only 51 percent of women who became pregnant limited their alcohol intake to four drinks per week, compared with 46 percent in the other group.
but the vascular system is an elastic system — it tightens up and takes up the slack so you don’t see the problem that is going on inside the cells of your body by testing your blood that is being tested in so many conditions.
these findings indicate the astaxanthin/flavangenol combination was highly effective at preventing the progression of diabetic complications.

however, according to hamilton, concentrations of 100 ppb and higher are commonly found in well water in many regions of the country including massachusetts, new hampshire, maine, florida, and large parts of the upper midwest, the southwest, and the rocky mountains.
since shortly after world war ii the generation of scientists who contributed so greatly to winning that war have championed nuclear power.
cholesterol is actually saving the lives of people, because cholesterol is a bandage, a waterproof bandage that the body has designed.
a cheaper source of construction materials than earth must be found.
i came away from that experience with the understanding that these people were all thirsty, and that thirst in the body can manifest itself in the form of abdominal pain to the level that the person can even become semi-conscious, because that’s the experience i had.
but the young people drank water, and corrected this dehydration.
with food production moved underground, vast tracts of land currently used for agriculture would become available for other uses.
so, when the body is short of water and they give it medication, naturally the person will die, because the medication is silencing the many cries of the body for water.
i mention his name so that you know i was immersed in medical school and research.
also, adding allergy barriers to their sheets and pillows can go a long way in preventing symptoms, though they can contain chemicals, so try to find one that does not.
mass-drivers were shown to obey their computer design programs within one percent – no new science there – just straightforward engineering.
mike: i thank you so much for your generosity, being willing to take this time and share your wisdom with the world.
so, waiting to get thirsty is to die prematurely and very painfully.
and the pharmaceutical companies know that treating cholesterol is a huge industry… dr. b: it’s a ten-billion dollar industry.
and i did that, and so it became a regular understanding that histamine is a water regulator in the body.
with panoramic skies, mild weather, zero-gravity play areas, and low-gravity housing for the elderly, space colonies would be popular among all age groups.
by the age of 70 we may be totally thirsty and obviously thirsty and yet not recognize the need to drink water, even when water is put next to us.
the billion 100-ton factories that nasa proposed would be less than one millionth of 1% of the moon.
the upgrade from “vulnerable” under australian environmental law entitles the world’s largest marsupial carnivore to greater protection in the island state of tasmania, environment minister peter garrett said in a statement.
“but arsenic disrupts the pathways of all five steroid hormone receptors (estrogen, testosterone, progesterone, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids), as well as several other hormone pathways.
moreover, astaxanthin helped maintain a higher mitochondria membrane potential and stimulated respiration, allowing for the production of increased levels of cellular energy.
so there is a movement afoot within the nih group of people to keep a closed lid on my information so that it doesn’t get out, because obviously they are more in favor of the drug industry, because it is now obvious that they are getting paid by them.
as documented in nasa’s study, all the required resources are in plentiful supply on the moon.
with a population density of only 1,000 per square mile it would comfortably house three million people.
we don’t know that the mexicans who got the flu were drinking high levels of arsenic, but it’s an intriguing notion that this may have contributed,” joshua hamilton, the mbl’s chief academic and scientific officer and a senior scientist in the mbl’s bay paul center, said in a statement to the media.
source: http://www.naturalnews.com/026310.html may 23, 2009 in mr green archive | 1 comment friday, may 22, 2009 by: barbara minton, natural health editor (naturalnews) summer is the season for astaxanthin, the carotenoid that blocks ultra violet damage to the skin.
cholesterol is actually an interim lifesaver, giving the body time to recover from its problems.
animals, including humans, must consume carotenoids as part of their diet.
mike: the predominant diagnosis of this, of course, i think in the minds of most people, and especially in most m.d.s would be that there is something physically or structurally compromised in that area.
and this process of reverse osmosis is stopped by alcohol.
unfortunately, the national academy of sciences and some other people recently have been telling people to wait until they get thirsty before they drink, which is the main error that we inherited 100 years ago from a man called walter bradford cannon.
in a study just published in the journal environmental health perspectives, hamilton and his colleagues reported on their study of mice that ingested 100 ppb (parts per billion) of arsenic in theirdrinking water for five weeks and then were exposed to h1n1.
in 1995, the same research group showed that astaxanthin prevents oral cancer in rats, and inhibits cancer in a manner more pronounced than that of beta carotene.
4.standard medical care which the patients would have gotten anyway, and that all patients received.
we should never interfere with cholesterol without knowing why the body has starting raising its level.
according to scientists at the marine biological laboratory (mbl) in woods hole, massachusetts, and dartmouth medical school, the ability to mount an immune response to h1ni infection, a form of influenza a, can be significantly compromised by even low levels ofarsenic exposure that commonly occur through drinking contaminated wellwater.
in addition to having the freshest possible food, there’s an even better reason why we would want to do this.
in the reverse osmosis process your body filters and injects water into the cells, and this is what i call reverse osmosis.
as reported in natural news last fall ( http://www.naturalnews.com/024909.html), research suggests the epa’s supposedly “safe” level of arsenic allowed in water supplies for public consumption isn’t safe at all and could be causing a host of health problems, including high blood pressure and artery-clogging atherosclerosis.
by the age of 70 we may be totally thirsty and obviously thirsty and yet not recognize the need to drink water, even when water is put next to us.
astaxanthin keeps inflammation away oxidative stress and inflammation are implicated in several different aspects of cardiovascular disease.
mike: so it’s fair to say that pharmaceuticals, as packaged by modern medicine, are the third leading cause of death in this country.
recent research has documented its ability to increase cellular energy, protect against and treat cancer, protect against damage to the brain andnervous system, and halt the progression of complications from diabetes.
the flexibility to change production is a key aspect of the factories.
this very slightly updated version now includes selected illustrations from ssi’s free-to-copy sample slides, the solar power satellite art set.
compliance with recommendations significantly increased after confirmation of pregnancy.
so, basically, this is what’s going on in medicine in america.
he wrote me, actually, and said we are satisfied with the way asthma is being treated.
after heart disease, which kills about seven or eight hundred thousand, cancer which kills about 500,000, drugs kill 250,000 people.
it was very interesting — i didn’t realize it at the beginning, but i now realize that the ad was speaking to me.
in other words, the brain totally loses track of what it’s doing, and it is published by a doctor who is an eminent doctor.
eliminating dairy products from your child`s diet can be helpful as they are believed to cause excess mucus.
now it appears another serious health problem — a higher susceptibility to a serious case of “swine flu” — can be added to that list of arsenic-in-drinking-water linked worries.
the intelligence behind the design of the body has it such that a drought management program will kick in, and then allergies are a sign of dehydration because the system that regulates water balance of the body suppresses the immune system, because it’s an energy-consuming situation.
even in a narrow band 25,000 miles above the equator, where a satellite can maintain a fixed orbit, plenty of solar energy streams by constantly to supply far more than enough energy for the earth of 2050.
welcome everyone, this is mike adams with truth publishing, and today i’m very excited to be welcoming dr. batmanghelidj, author of water for health, for healing, for life.
pretreatment of the cells with astaxanthin preserved cellular integrity in a dose dependent manner, and inhibited mitochondrial dysfunctions, including lowered membrane potential, and gene repair.
and the brain translates this information for the conscious mind in the form of pain.
it improves fine lines and wrinkles, skin elasticity and moisture content while reducing inflammation and cell damage that leads to premature aging.
mike: i think it is, first of all, that is an amazing account of what has been happening, and i think it is fair to say, too, that the pharmaceutical industry and organized medicine in general, really doesn’t want to promote anything that is free or near-free to the average patient.
this characteristic allows astaxanthin to extend its superior antioxidant activity to the central nervous system, which is highly susceptible to damage by free radicals.
the fibroblasts were treated with carotenoids including astaxanthin 24 hours before exposure to uva.
nor economical, nor environmentally acceptable to lift from the earth by rockets the thousands of tons of materials needed to build an sps that would supply earth electricity equal to the output of ten nuclear power plants.
fusion power appears still far from realization, and would not be free of radioactivity.
eliminating dairy products from your child`s diet can be helpful as they are believed to cause excess mucus.
immune response seriously hampered by arsenic exposure
now there is a report that actually these statins, cholesterol-lowering drugs produce amnesia.
(experimental dermatology, march) astaxanthin increases cellular energy by protecting mitochondria mitochondria are the cellular furnaces in which food is turned into energy in the form of atp.
mostdoctors, however, will not tell you about the natural and safe ways to eliminate or reduce your child`s suffering, but rather yank out their prescription pad and send you on your way.
the researchers then investigated how astaxanthin stimulated and interacted with mitochondria when it is stressed.
now, depending on where dehydration is settled, you feel pain there.
there was a marked abolishment of free radical generation resulting in the blocking of activation of pro-cancer gene p38.
pre-treatment with astaxanthin esters resulted in significant increase in the body’s own antioxidants (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase).
and breathing — when we are short of breath, it means we are dehydrated.
anything that would eat it will lose its art of camouflage, its alertness, good reaction, good response, and becomes easy prey to its own food chain predator.
fibroblasts from skin were exposed to moderate doses of uva, which stimulated cell death, increased levels offree radicals and other reactive substances, decreasedantioxidant enzymes activities, and promoted membrane disturbance and enzyme denaturing of hemoglobin.
the fact that mexico has large areas of very high arsenic in well water — and these include the locations where h1n1 first appeared — intrigued the mbl and dartmouth research team.
information is getting out into the hands of the public, so the pharmaceutical industry has to naturally increase its advertising to nullify this information that i have put out.
with a population density of only 1,000 per square mile it would comfortably house three million people.
we were given something unique in our solar system: an enormous moon, orbiting tantalizingly nearby, and containing on its surface just the materials we need.
nasa, now a timid, fearful nasa made up of aging pre-retirees rather than the young tigers who made apollo work in just eight years, would be frightened out of its skin by a tough, make-it-work assignment with a tight budget and a tighter time scale.
after 24 hours when water was made available, the elderly did not recognize that they were thirsty.
according to chinese medical theory, acupuncture points are located on energy meridians alongside which qi flows.
so, basically, this is what’s going on in medicine in america.
“the findings of this research show that acupuncture-like treatments, including simulated acupuncture, can elicit positive responses,” said josephine p. briggs, m.d., director of national center for complementary and alternative medicine.
dr. b: first and foremost, don’t wait until you get thirsty, because that’s an error.
a neti pot looks like a miniature tea pot which is filled with warmwater and sea salt.
the scientists backed up their finding by in vitro assay which supported their conclusion that astaxanthan was protective against cataracts which are usually caused by environmental insult.
that happened because environmentalists feared reactor accidents and the certainty of nuclear wastes, and because of the mental association of “nuclear” with weapons.
we don’t know that the mexicans who got the flu were drinking high levels of arsenic, but it’s an intriguing notion that this may have contributed,” joshua hamilton, the mbl’s chief academic and scientific officer and a senior scientist in the mbl’s bay paul center, said in a statement to the media.
first of all, there is plenty of energy in space.
they’d be self-repairing, electrically lighted, and designed as sub-basements to our homes.
for children, it can be fun watching all the snot and gunk come out of their noses.
devils do not exist in the wild outside tasmania, although mainland zoos are breeding captive populations as a strategy against total extinction.
sodas cause dehydration mike: now here’s another interesting question people have — when they go out to eat at a restaurant, there’s a tremendous amount of economic pressure from the point of view of the restaurant chain or restaurant owner to serve them something other than water.
we should never interfere with cholesterol without knowing why the body has starting raising its level.
but in the lab animals exposed to arsenic in their water, something was clearly amiss.
it immediately gives you a bit of the minerals that you probably will have lost sweating.
they found that data from multiple species support the antioxidant/anti-inflammation properties of axtaxanthin, establishing it as an appropriate candidate for development as a therapeutic agent for cardiovascular oxidative stress and inflammation.
perhaps most alarming, according to researchers, was the fact that only 44 percent of women in the study took any folic acid supplements at all, and only 5.5 percent took 400 micrograms or more.
all they have to do is become curious as to learn.
insufficient folic acid levels can cause neurological defects in an infant before most women even know they are pregnant.
dr. b: jargon peddling is the way of commercial medicine.
information is getting out into the hands of the public, so the pharmaceutical industry has to naturally increase its advertising to nullify this information that i have put out.
when we drink enough water so that the urine is colorless, that is a good sign.
university of sydney researchers seeking to understand how a facial cancer could be contagious found that the tumors had originated from a single cell line that spreads by biting.
indeed, those most seriously studying sps are japan and europe.
prune-like cells do not function in the same manners as a plum-like cell.
these symptoms mean, okay, let us get the ingredients that the body needs into the system.
astaxanthin resulted in a 220% increase in the expression of the well known anti-cancer gene p 53, and a 160% and 250% increase respectively in the anti-cancergenes p21 and p27.
the campaign was called just say no to h2o, and they were rewarding waiters for making sure people bought some soft drinks rather than drinking water.
dr. b: well, of course, the compromise is when the tissue is dehydrated, it’s changing structure.
i’m also talking about alcohol, because alcohol actually stops the emergency water supply systems to the important cells, such as the brain cells.
and this process of reverse osmosis is stopped by alcohol.
fuels like methane, propane, and butane can be synthesized using recycled carbon dioxide to put energy into portable form.
astaxanthin inhibited cell growth in a dose and time dependent manner by arresting cell cycle progression and by promoting the death of cancerous cells.
so, we need not only correct dehydration, but also to supply the minerals and vitamins and so on so that the body can repair itself.
i like to illustrate that tradition-bound thinking by posing the six-match puzzle.
26% is from the environment around the cells, and only 8% is lost from the vascular system.
by definition, each factory would have the capacity to produce its own weight of hi-tech machinery annually: their combined industrial output would be 100 billion tons.
yes, well you see, drought management means that you have to clog the holes where water is lost from the body.
there is already occupied and engaged water, which is no good for new function.
water is the most precious commodity in the interior of your body, and when not enough is coming in and more is being lost, this is a no-no situation for your body.
aflatoxins are deadly products of mold that can cause liver damage and cancer.
i wasn’t scared, i was curious.
in the bureaucratic format, satellite power has no natural home and no built-in constituency.
mike: you are, i’m sure the listeners would agree here, you are to be applauded for being able to venture outside of conventional medicine.
i like to illustrate that tradition-bound thinking by posing the six-match puzzle.
astaxanthin was also shown to inhibit aflatoxin b1 induceddna damage.
astaxanthin was also shown to inhibit aflatoxin b1 induceddna damage.
that can be done, even for road transportation, if electricity can be made cheaply enough.
fig 5.12 self-replicating factory fig 5.19 self-growing factory at any time, new software could be loaded into the factories to produce consumer goods like solar power cells, electric cars, and automated greenhouses for delivery to earth in great numbers.
breast cancer was the subject of researchers in china looking into the effects carotenoids have on proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and the expression of the cancer promoting bcl-2 gene.
that’s why i’ve put out my information for everyone to use on the internet, and it is only for further use or further education that i have produced my books and so on, and those books unfortunately, the cost of printing, distribution, forces the price on the information.
“there was a massive infiltration of immune cells to the lungs and a massive inflammatory response, which led to bleeding and damage in the lung,” hamilton said in the media statement.
insufficient folic acid levels can cause neurological defects in an infant before most women even know they are pregnant.
solar power received at ground level cannot be converted to energy in the amounts needed without paving much of the world with solar cells.
it’s bad education, and we think that these soft drinks are synonymous with water.
the least-developed industrial nations use only a hundredth as much energy as the most developed – but they suffer a living standard a hundred times lower in consequence.

dr. b: we, as doctors, are really 007 agents of the pharmaceutical industry.
the recent outbreak of a type of influenza a known ash1n1, or “swine flu”, has killed over 70 mexicans so far and at least six americans.
they found that astaxanthin improved the ability of the mitochondria to remain in a reduced state and maintain its functional integrity under oxidative challenge.
only phytoplankton, algae, plants, and certain bacteria and fungi are able to synthesizecarotenoids such as astaxanthin.
dr. b: you don’t have to try and take the last drop of blood out of a person who comes to you in order to get help from you.
the disease is caused by bites inflicted on each other’s faces as part of a bizarre mating ritual or while squabbling over food.
all of the patients were asked to rate their chronic lowback pain on a scale of 0-to-10.
of the carotenoids tested, only astaxanthin exhibited a pronounced photoprotective effect and countered all of the uva induced alterations to a significant extent.
based on these results, the scientists strongly suggested that treatment with astaxanthin may be effective for oxidative stress-associated neurodegeneration.
when we drink enough water so that the urine is colorless, that is a good sign.
like any popular, large-scale movement, it has its irresponsible fringes, but it is impressive not only for its power, but for the number of its thoughtful, reasoning supporters.
more research has documented the anti-tumor activity of astaxanthin and its mode of action, as well as the contribution of its antioxidant properties to protect against cancer metastasis.
when we are dehydrated, these goodies are not delivered either.
the flexibility to change production is a key aspect of the factories.
in fact, the nih, the office of alternative medicine, had its first conference when the office was created, and i was asked to make my presentation, but when the proceedings of the conference came out, my presentation was censored after the proceedings.
nasa’s solution was simple: they’d build a fully automated, solar-powered factory and land it on the moon in the year 2000.
so, first thing, people should never allow themselves to get thirsty — they should drink throughout the day.
i don’t think about money, because money is, if you do a good deed, money will come as a by product of that good deed.
in one scenario, mining ganymede alone would provide enough space colonies for a human population of a thousand trillion wealthy people.
researchers measured any improvements and changes in symptoms after eight weeks, 26 weeks and 52 weeks.
warner bros., which owns taz, and cnn founder ted turner, who started the cartoon network, have helped fund the fight against the disease.
when the urine becomes yellow, it means that the body is beginning to become dehydrated and when it becomes orange, then the body is truly dehydrated and some part of the body is suffering from that dehydration.
it’s available as a free pdf file, a printed book, and as web pages.
i’ve identified why these three diseases are actually the branches of the same tree, and each one naturally produces a different problem at different age brackets, but they are all related conditions that occur as a result of dehydration over time.
back pain is the biggest reason why americans use alternative therapies like acupuncture.
dr. b: that woke me up, because in medical school i’d never heard that water could cure pain, that kind of pain, in fact.
the researchers found that the animals’ immune response to h1n1 infection was initially very weak.
joint pain, back pain, arthritis cause by chronic dehydration dr. b.:
i have satisfied myself that transmission does not involve significant risks.
when it manifests pain, in fact, it is indicating dehydration.
people can keep an eye on the website http://www.watercure.com, and it will be posted there when the book is available.
why and how water effectively treats pain and inflammation discovery of the water cure mike: welcome everyone, this is mike adams with truth publishing, and today i’m very excited to be welcoming dr. batmanghelidj, author of water for health, for healing, for life.
i wonder if you can give our readers a brief of what the major diseases are and why they are aggravated or promoted by chronic dehydration.
he explained that for arsenic to have health consequences, it requires exposure day after day, year after year, such as through drinking water — and that’s exactly the kind of exposure far too many americans have to the toxin.
astaxanthin keeps people feeling good too.
mike: so this is a very easy sign that people can pay attention to.
but nonetheless, people who did discover that water could cure their heartburn are wiser than those who buy into that advertising stunt.
the degree of cataract formation was lower than in the control group.
the neti pot can also help prevent allergic reactions from turning into sinus infections.
we are knee-jerk doctors.
treatment with various neurotoxins led to significant decreases in dopamine cells, whereas a significant protection was shown when the cells were pretreated with astaxanthin.
i have written a book called water cures and drugs kill.
because i think it’s totally dishonest, in fact, criminal, to treat a person who is just thirsty, and give them toxic medication so that he gets sick and dies earlier than normal.
“having a healthy lifestyle is important for everyone, but is particularly so for women who may become pregnant because this can affect the health of their baby, not only at birth but throughout life,” said bridget benelam of the british nutrition foundation.
astaxanthin has been referred to as nature’s sunscreen, but it does a whole lot more to keep people looking good by promoting beauty and radiant health from the inside out.
a neti pot looks like a miniature tea pot which is filled with warmwater and sea salt.
you see, we lose about a quart of water through breathing every day.
people who attempt the puzzle usually push the matches about the table for awhile and then give up.
free radicals activate transcriptional messengers that contribute to endothelial dysfunction, initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, irreversible damage following stoke, and heart arrhythmia.
studies on human blood cells have demonstrated that astaxanthan enhances immunoglobulin production in response to t-cell dependent stimuli.
and i did that, and so it became a regular understanding that histamine is a water regulator in the body.
by definition, each factory would have the capacity to produce its own weight of hi-tech machinery annually: their combined industrial output would be 100 billion tons.
(2) no matter how comfortable earth becomes, many people will want the special luxuries found in space colonies.
in mild cases of allergies in children, doctors are all too quick to prescribe antihistamines, steroids, or other pharmaceuticals to treat the symptoms, not the cause.
these symptoms mean, okay, let us get the ingredients that the body needs into the system.
the payoff could be only 25 years away.
average person really needs four quarts of water a day.
it deals with putting needles into specific points in the body to relieve pain or to help with other therapeutic purposes.
perhaps most alarming, according to researchers, was the fact that only 44 percent of women in the study took any folic acid supplements at all, and only 5.5 percent took 400 micrograms or more.
urinary damage in the mix group was 36% lower than in the control.
how dehydration causes the vascular system to constrict, leading to hypertension •
the researchers found that the animals’ immune response to h1n1 infection was initially very weak.
“one thing that did strike us, when we heard about the recent h1n1 outbreak, is [that] mexico has large areas of very high arsenic in their well water, including the areas wherethe flu first cropped up.
another microalgae, haematococcus pluvialis, contains primarily dark red pigment.
its normal rate of production is of course is to create membranes for the cell membranes and brain cells and nerve insulation and of course the hormones of the body, vitamin d for the body.
it is joined by the heavy industries which see (or used to see) nuclear power as a market opportunity.
but when you factor in the toll that the chemicals take on your system, it`s really a lot more convenient to practice prevention.
astaxanthin is found in many types of seafood and is what gives the reddish-orange color to salmon, shrimp, red fish, and lobster.
in fact,astaxanthin may truly be considered a miracle nutrient.
(1) we could design automated, family-sized greenhouses and have them delivered to everyone.

warner bros., which owns taz, and cnn founder ted turner, who started the cartoon network, have helped fund the fight against the disease.
those panels convert solar energy to electricity, and then to low-density radio waves.
because of their ability to extinguish free radicals, researchers at the university of hawaii, characterized the mechanism by which the carotenoid group works and reviewed preclinical data.
and there are 60 million americans who don’t realize that actually hypertension is one of the manifestations of drought management programs of the body when the body begins to operate a reverse osmosis process, to deliver water into the interior of those cells which are 66% water deficient.
but on the other hand, it can be quite miserable running around with itchy eyes and a box of tissues all day.
dr. b: it’s interesting, because you see, the body manufactures cholesterol as an emergency situation, when it raises the level of its production.
in the reverse osmosis process your body filters and injects water into the cells, and this is what i call reverse osmosis.
it is used to flush the nasal cavities of excess mucus and debris and has no side effects.
another microalgae, haematococcus pluvialis, contains primarily dark red pigment.
of course, i have published extensively for the scientific community, but no one is picking up.
i’m also talking about alcohol, because alcohol actually stops the emergency water supply systems to the important cells, such as the brain cells.
they were randomly divided into four groups: 1.individualized acupuncture with a needle, a diagnostician did a customized prescription for acupuncture points.
of course, they don’t know, they don’t do it knowingly.
cholesterol is actually an interim lifesaver, giving the body time to recover from its problems.
i’ve identified why these three diseases are actually the branches of the same tree, and each one naturally produces a different problem at different age brackets, but they are all related conditions that occur as a result of dehydration over time.
without any help from human workers, the 100 ton factory would mine the soil around it, would manufacture spare parts to maintain and repair itself, and would manufacture enough extra parts to assemble a copy of itself in one year.
people who attempt the puzzle usually push the matches about the table for awhile and then give up.
the payoff could be only 25 years away.
i said, “well, drink more water.”
none of the study participants had tried acupuncture before.
this makes the drugs the use of drugs the number three killer processes in the country — protected and licensed killer process.
two quarts we get from food metabolism and water content in foods.
this characteristic allows astaxanthin to extend its superior antioxidant activity to the central nervous system, which is highly susceptible to damage by free radicals.
they concluded that the mechanism through which astaxanthan protects neuroblastoma cells is its potent antioxidant activity.
mike: i think it is, first of all, that is an amazing account of what has been happening, and i think it is fair to say, too, that the pharmaceutical industry and organized medicine in general, really doesn’t want to promote anything that is free or near-free to the average patient.
because tasmanian devils are genetically similar, their bodies do not recognize the tumors as foreign cells and do not produce an effective immune response.
it is actually the surface tension in the alveoli of the lungs that produces contraction of these tiny membranes, and air is pushed out.
so the conscious mind gets the information that, hey, this area we can’t use anymore, it has a shortage of water.
the body needs new water, or free water, to perform new functions.
obtaining power from the temperature difference between surface and deep ocean waters in the tropical oceans would change the global climate profoundly by altering the heat balance at the ocean’s surface.
advanced automation for space missions is available as a printed book in 7 parts (chapters) from national technology information service.
because everyone assumes that aids is actually a viral disease, which is a fraudulent statement by those people who presented it, because the human body is the product of many, many years of having fought various viral diseases, and has survived.
so, it is not the stickiness of the cholesterol that is the problem, which the drug industry is drumming it into the minds of people — cholesterol is sticky, reduce it otherwise you will have blockage of your arteries, which is all nonsense.
it is simply to locate, in high orbit, large arrays of solar panels.
but unfortunately, this information is not reaching the public through the medical community because it’s not a money-maker.
smallpox, polio, measles, and all the other viruses that can kill very easily, and the body has an ability to mount a defense system against these hot viruses, viruses that actually very quickly can kill.
people can order through the internet athttp://www.watercure.com or amazon.com or barnesandnoble.com or go to the bookstore and get it.
4.standard medical care which the patients would have gotten anyway, and that all patients received.
treating hypertension with water mike: for the pharmaceutical industry, the existence of disease is a business question, because let’s face it, the pharmaceutical industry is a for-profit industry.
by eliminating the excess mucus from nasal passages, the rinse prevents crusting from mucus that would have otherwise stayed in the nose.
yes, well you see, drought management means that you have to clog the holes where water is lost from the body.
he wrote me, actually, and said we are satisfied with the way asthma is being treated.
during this process,oxygen is released, producing several oxygen-derived free radicals that play an important role in various diseases.
i use very simple english to explain complicated problems.
dr. b: that’s because everyone is after a fast buck, even at the expense of someone else’s health.
if people drank water on a regular basis and took enough salt and minerals to expand the capillary beds, hypertension would disappear completely.
we are concerned enough with the rise of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect that our desire, as environmentalists, is to phase out the use of fossil fuels.
university of sydney researchers seeking to understand how a facial cancer could be contagious found that the tumors had originated from a single cell line that spreads by biting.
now if cholesterol wasn’t there to cover up the tear and abrasions, blood would get under the membrane and peel it off and that person would be dead instantly.
the antennas convert the radio waves with an efficiency so high that less than 100 watts of waste heat goes into the environment for every 1,000 watts that goes into power lines.
and the mechanism is very simple — when there isn’t enough water to be evenly distributed and certain parts of the body are working but not receiving enough water to deal with its toxic waste and metabolism, and the toxic waste builds up that area, the nerve endings in that area register the chemical environmental change with the brain.
animals, including humans, must consume carotenoids as part of their diet.
oddly enough, it is often more unwelcome to people who think of themselves as experts than to people who have a general, rather than a specialized education.
these are some of the perceptive signs of dehydration.
astaxanthin inhibited cell growth in a dose and time dependent manner by arresting cell cycle progression and by promoting the death of cancerous cells.
because if they’re young people, they’ve got many years to go, and unfortunately in a dishonest form of medical practice, they can become vulnerable.
and some years later, i had to give two glasses of water to a person who was doubled up in abdominal pain from his disease, because i had no other medication to give him at that moment.
studies on human blood cells have demonstrated that astaxanthan enhances immunoglobulin production in response to t-cell dependent stimuli.
this information is free, it’s the latest information in medical science, it’s the future science of medicine, it’s the foundation of the future science of medicine, and they have it at their use, free of charge.
the link between dehydration and asthma mike: i’d like you to elaborate a little more on asthma, and the idea that the body is managing its water supply deliberately in a way that produces symptoms that are called asthma.
that’s why we develop high-blood pressure in dehydration.
dr. b: it will be available by the end of the year.
while a lot of factors can be at work, from good nutrition to physical fitness, a new study suggests an all-too-common toxin in the water you drink could play a role in whether an h1n1 infection makes you seriously ill.
therefore all progress belongs to unreasonable people.

and the brain translates this information for the conscious mind in the form of pain.
dr. b: we, as doctors, are really 007 agents of the pharmaceutical industry.
then anger, quick reaction, depression, these are all signs of dehydration, when the brain has very little energy from hydroelectricity to cope with the information or take action.
they found that data from multiple species support the antioxidant/anti-inflammation properties of axtaxanthin, establishing it as an appropriate candidate for development as a therapeutic agent for cardiovascular oxidative stress and inflammation.
i’m here to be heard and you make it possible for me to be heard, and i’m grateful to you.
