to prevent soil from washing out of the drainage holes, place a piece of weed barrier cloth, or even a few dried leaves or several layers of newspaper over the holes before adding the soil.
as a general rule always pick plants that are hardier to colder winters than where you live because soil that’s aboveground gets colder.
c. grandiflora ‘morning calm’ is commonly available and is compact, with larger flowers than most trumpet vines.
many gardeners bring their pots indoors for the winter, preferably to a basement or garage that stays between 40 and 60 degrees f. (but who has that?
there are  concerns about wooden containers that have been treated — fear that the  vapors can damage plants, andhere’s some information about treated wood  and plants.
paul james confirmed the short-lived nature of most trees in  pots recently, as did a nurseryman specializing in conifers, when questioned by  me at a trade show.
it’s practically gardening tradition to cover drainage holes with broken terra cotta chards or an inch of gravel, but respected horticultural authoritylinda chalker-scott says studies have shown that the practice actually impedes drainage - because water does not travel well from the potting mix to the coarse gravel mixture.
landscape designer michelle derviss suggests choosing containers that match the color or style of the house.
(i’ll repeat here:  they’d better be hardy to at least one zone colder than where you live.)
the best-looking shrub-in-a-pot i’ve grown is that most malleable of shrubs, theacuba.
i’ve tried some trees in pots, korean and bosnian pines, and a  couple of short junipers, but one of the pines quickly outgrew its pot and the  other one i feared wouldn’t last long, so i’ve moved them both to  the garden.

on gardenrant elizabeth asked the design question: to mix plants within one pot or not?
pebbles can bake the plants, which is fine for succulents.
or you can do what’s frequently suggested — leave your  not-hardy-enough plants outdoors but wrap them up in burlap or bubble wrap or  something equally unattractive.
she uses half compost and half sandy soil for her pots, with a sterile potting medium only for the top two inches and mulch on top of that to prevent weeds.
he also recommends large containers — a cubic yard of potting soil to  support enough vine to at least partially cover a pergola, for example.
for woody plants, he suggests: japanese maple, kousa dogwood, ‘little henry’virginia sweetspire, ‘emerald’ arborvitae, ‘hetz midget’ arborvitae, dwarf falsecypress ‘nana gracilis,’ golden variegated euonymus (e. japonicus ‘aureomarginatus’) and wintergreen boxwood.
some experts recommend including fertilizer with every other watering, which seems like a lot.
lerner suggests these perennials for pots in the shade : rhodea, hellebore, astilbe, japanese painted fern, evergreen wood fern, bleeding heart ‘luxuriant’, hosta, columbine, cardinal flower, hardy begonia, and woodland phlox.
root cellars may be best but again, who has that?)
one possible solution i’ve seen suggested is to line the inside of the pot with a thin layer of packing wrap, which will expand and contract against the side of the pot — or at least that’s the idea.
work with odd numbers of plants, and maybe add a nice rock or art object to enhance the arrangement.
my favorite perennial for pots in the sun you already know — sedums of all types.
when their roots expand  outward enough to contact the pot itself, those freeze-and-thaw cycles are  murder on them.
those soil-less mixtures have the advantage of being lightweight,  well-draining and disease-free, but do need all their nutrients provided by  you, don’t forget.
many gardeners bring their pots indoors for the winter, preferably to a  basement or garage that stays between 40 and 60 degrees f. (but who has that?
you can  accomplish these arrangements in one large, stand-alone container or by using  several containers of different sorts with a variety of plants.

its  flowers are a mix of peach, pastel orange and light yellow.
don recommends just one pot of flowers or cluster of pots to one side of  the front door rather than pots evenly matched on both sides.

but sometimes we grow plants despite the trouble they cause us because we love them, or maybe because balcony or rooftop gardening is our only option.
then take note of a plant’s watering requirements and ask yourself if you’ll really be watchful about watering daily, for instance.
or you can do what’s frequently suggested — leave your not-hardy-enough plants outdoors but wrap them up in burlap or bubble wrap or something equally unattractive.
(most of my in-ground plants are a zone or two hardier than technically  required, too, but when plants are in pots it’smandatory.)
work with odd numbers of plants, and  maybe add a nice rock or art object to enhance the arrangement.
if potted plants are tropical they can usually be brought indoors to winter over as houseplants, assuming you cut way back on the watering and give them the right type and amount of sun.
i agree with the other experts who suggestevery two  or three weeks.
fill the container with the growing medium to within one inch from the rim — to leave room for watering without water spilling over the side.
one  of the best gardeners i know plants coleus in12″-tall pots in the spring,  then places the pots strategically throughout one of her numerous flower beds.
hanging baskets are often lined with sphagnum moss to better hold water.

then give it a good soaking before planting.
insert plants so they meet the soil again about an inch from the pot’s rim and add or remove soil so that the soil surface is smooth and also an inch below the rim.
and  containers are portable, so we can move plants around the garden or even  indoors for the winter, especially with the help of plant dollies.
activities and events all about gardening in containers to be honest, container gardens are more work than in-ground gardens, the  exception being potted succulents, like my sedum collection that happily bakes  in the sun with no supplemental watering.
containers are also great when our soil is horrible for planting.
the debate is between plantings of  mixed plants or filling each pot with lots of only one particular plant.
automatic watering systems can work like  a dream, i’m told.
still, it’s hard to water often enough if the basket is hung in the hot  afternoon sun.
so, for  example, in my zone 7a garden i choose plants hardy to zone 5 or colder for  pot.

then add a half-inch of  mulch to preserve moisture, prevent weeds and most obviously, to keep soil from  splashing up onto your plants — ugh.
by july the perennials and annuals rising from the earth completely hide the pots; all one sees are these great plumes of coleus bursting up 18″ to 20″ above the ground and one thinks, wow, can she ever grow coleus!”
these days, soil-less potting “media” are popular — all bagged up at the hardware store or garden center.

in the photo  above, most of the planters are fiberglass and they cost about $60 each.

i recently saw one that snaked up the posts of a deck  to automatically water all the pots on the deck.
and check this site for some great-looking winter container ideas.
these days a very popular alternative are the lightweight fiberglass and  resin planters that mimic real stone, terra cotta, or concrete.

here’s what the national arboretum’s scott aker suggests: trumpet vine (campus radicans), because it attracts hummingbirds and is  native to this region, though he considers the chinese version, campsis  grandiflora, even nicer.

more recommendations coming here soon.

what about covering the drainage hole?
it’s best to use an organic fertilizer that’s diluted in water, like fish emulsion and liquid seaweed.
sources recommend containers that are as wide as they are tall for stability and for good insulation of roots.

plastic pots are inexpensive and are slow to dry out, which is an  advantage with most plants, but a disadvantage for plants that need “good  drainage” — like lavender or these sedums.
