to keep these winter flowering container plants healthy, feed them regularly with a foliar or liquid fertiliser.and because i'm a change bunny, they can't simply be reconstituted as they were - the pots need a new identity, there must be fresh, vibrant, healthy plants, and they need to be placed somewhere completely different to give a new aspect to the garden.new terracotta is fine - it will soon look as old as the hills - and glossy ceramic planters are gorgeous for modern courtyards and terraces.it's quite a lot of work, but the upside is that freshly cleaned, painted or new containers give the garden a great lift in the middle of winter, and make it all look as if somebody terribly stylish really cares about it.i'm having a love affair with camellias at the moment and have discovered that hybrids based on the small-leaf species, which have masses of little flowers, can be used as container plants.the asplenium bulbiferum fern is beautiful as well as very useful and makes a striking cover plant for shady situations.to give new plants a bedded-in look, cover the soil with mulch.you may be tempted by those "potted colour" stands in the garden centre, but you could also consider something a bit more permanent and which could be transplanted into the garden at a later date.i have to admit that the most colourful plants in my garden right now are tangelos, mandarins and limes, reminding me that citrus looks brilliant in containers.if your container is wide-mouthed, there may be room to plant smaller plants beneath the main event, or add decorative rocks, pieces of driftwood or ornaments.because i have a very short attention span, and instant gratification is essential, within an eight-hour timespan i have to empty the containers, clean or paint them, replant them and reposition them.its lush, lacy foliage looks quite tropical and it loves the shade.leigh bramwell | wednesday, november 23, 2011 5:00 refurbished containers with healthy plants will add interest and colour to otherwise dull spots.getting your containers sorted is the easy part - figuring out what to plant in them is more of a challenge.i'd counsel against painting terracotta containers a solid colour because they tend to come out looking a bit cheap and plastic-like, but you can paint them flat white, or another flat colour which can then be sanded back to reveal touches of the original material.
