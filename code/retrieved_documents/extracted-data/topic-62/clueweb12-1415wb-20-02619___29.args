for this reason i will continue to promote sovereign self-health care strategies here at danielvitalis.com.
i am so enthusiastic about this upcoming foraging and touring season.
this workshop will be fully catered with organic, local food, prepared by chef frank giglio, who is one of my best friends and a truly culinary mentor of mine.
when we eat and drink – we practice relationship with different forces, with spirits and sentience.
the initial fermentation stage is wonderful, as the cider develops its sparkling effervescence.
if you are thinking of coming, secure your space soon because this workshop will fill!
through the alchemy of the fermentative process something new will be created, and that new thing is known as the “synbiotic”.
my first reaction to seeing petroleum in the spring was notable concern.
my personal approach to nutrition has indeed been influenced by his writings, and most influential of all was the documentary “the botany of desire”.
i had mentioned that wild plant harvesting by humans can actually benefit the ecosystem.
~daniel ps, check out this podcast i recently did where we discuss the history of grains and agriculture, as well as some must have information on making the grains you use a safe and healthy food!
for those of us living in areas where chaga is not readily available we can substitute the chaga tea base with any medicinal teas we are currently working with, keeping in mind that the flavor may vary slightly… but not enough to make that big of a difference.
in fact, for much of the year i use it almost daily and have for several years now… chaga is normally decocted (boiled in water to produce a broth or tea) for about two hours, yielding a very mild vanilla like flavor (it containsvanillin as one of its components) which is great to drink on its own, with added cream and a sweetener (i like maple syrup) to create a drink much like coffee.
consequently, many do not understand their true value.
either the pictures weren’t clear, the text wasn’t informative enough, the author was lacking real experience, or the book just wasn’t laid out in a user friendly way (ok, samuel thayer’s books are an exception to these criticisms, and are excellent wild food references).
the elixircraft mastery program is an excellent resource for understanding the concept and components of making liquid medicinal preparations and
he is to be commended, and thanked, for his making wilbur a subject of his professional, guerrilla, video journalism.
invite the forces of nature, say an orange or a mushroom, and with the right kind of eyes – grow further infused with infinite ecologies of everlasting spirits.
i will be talking aboutrewilding and transcending human domestication, and how we can stay strong, healthy, and actively-fit for a lifetime in a world that constantly pushing us towards a deeper state of domestication.
there is no other place on earth that leaves me feeling so connected to the land and to the elements!
my close friendfrank giglio will be creating all of our meals throughout the weekend using the freshest local, organic, and wild-crafted ingredients.
if you are looking for a premier chaga extract you can find it at my company,surthrival.
if you are thinking of coming, secure your space soon because this workshop will fill!
for years i used this fungus without peeling it, which yeilded wonderful results, but now that i have included the traditional preperation method, it would be difficult to depart from.
more than this, it also prevents the conversion of testosterone into a metabolite known as dihydrotestosterone, which has been implicated in benign prostate hyperplasia and even male pattern baldness.
not only is this book the most useful and user friendly i have seen on the subject, but by purchasing it you are directly supporting the preservation of remaining wild places in a radical new way, by educating people how to care for and interface with wild nature.
this video post is about peeling chaga, which is its traditional preparation method in siberia (it is from their folk medicine that we have learned of chaga).
before trying truly wild rice, i was familiar only with the store bought, paddy cultivated wild rice which, though wonderful in flavor and rich in nutrition, just simply pales in comparison.
this water runs down past a pool known as the “emerald pool” which is much hotter than the guitar pool.
fermentation can seem a bit intimidating when you haven’t tried it before, and that is why i am posting this video.
this video details how you can make your own, and at a very low price at that.
plant-based edible living sculpture with vibrant living beings who in return sculpt you.
so it’s really up to us to take an interest if we are to make the friendship of those spirits.
this is going to be a very special weekend, featuring talks by botharthur haines and myself, as well as introductions to several earth based surthrival skills.
the fresh maple sap is so refreshing, so hydrating, and tastes so good that it is almost shocking that more people aren’t taking advantage of this delicious, abundant, and free late winter/early spring drink!
also, special thanks to my friends at evolver for inviting me to be a part of thevisionary nutrition project, beginning on april 8th with my interview, where i will be teaching about the role of psychoactive plants in the human ecological and dietary niche.
check out the video below to hear more about ancestral ignition , and to see acclaimed botanist, author, and my foraging and aboriginal skills guide and all around friend, arthur haines, make a fire with a primitive tool known as the bow drill.
because we will be teaching actual skills on the land, we must limit the class size in order to ensure that each student experiences an attentive learning environment.
if you are looking for a riveting adventure, are interested in peruvian shamanism, amazonian biology, visiting machu pichu, or just wanting to soak in a rain forest hotspring, this trip might be for you.
the world and its spirits don’t really care if we do, for the most part.
in the recent video post we made about wilbur hot spring, i showed a spring that appears to be bringing up petroleum oil!
hand harvested, sundried, fire parched, foot treaded, and wind winnowed wild rice is so soft and delicate in flavor that it simply has to be tasted to be understood.
what he shares here is a truly wild food, fully medicinal, and even better tasting than what i was used to!
i’ll let you watch the videos first though… the recipe is included at the bottom of the post.
and while i love reading, sometimes i get even more (i must admit) out of watching a well crafted video.
growing in size, staring at our hands, finding our feet, rubbing our eyeballs, mind boggled – immersed, surrounded, and face to face with an overwhelming presence perceived, at times, as threatening.
this e-book is very comprehensive, and empowers us to take our dental health into our own hands for a lifetime.
in contrast to many wild foraged plants, wild rice requires a more considerable amount of know how and equipment to locate, access, harvest, and process, so to show this in its entirety is simply outside the scope of a blog post.
the class has been filling up rather quickly these last few weeks, and we are getting very excited for the spring foraging to begin!
we strive to put on events that can nourish the body, inform the mind, and touch the spirit.
the entire book is extensively footnoted so that you can access the scientific literature from which so much of this information has been compiled.
significantly, it’s acleanse – of body, of mind – and by extension, environment.
when standing on the hill, the high point of the property, surrounded by the 360 degrees of arizona mountains, looking down at the valley, the magick of this place becomes clear.
trees will be here long after we’re gone, and so will stones and bricks and clouds and the moon.
making your own nettle root tinctures at home can be easy, and only takes few minutes.
i am grateful to the abundant earth.
of course the beverages fermented by native peoples and by our traditional cultural forebearers were much healthier and nutritionally viable than those of today, created with local ingredients and wild yeasts, and were not filtered and pasturized like the ones that most of us were raised around.
stinging nettle (urtica dioica) is an herbaceous perennial flowering plant known by many of us for the painful stinging hairs (they are actually called “trichomes”) that inject histamine into our skin like micro hypodermic needles.
it is 3 days long, catered by chef frank giglio with all local organic and wild food, and taught by myself and wild food expertarthur haines.
~daniel jan 12, 2011 | current projects, interviews, wild food & water | view comments for those of us who are developing or returning to our ancestral health through traditional and indigenous nutritional practices, few food preparation skills are as valuable to possess as lacto-fermentation.
this is afree interview – call in to  listen live at 10 a.m. est (9 a.m. cst & 8 a.m. pst).
so i can honestly tell you they are the best around.
~d p.s. though saline water is what people usually put in their neti pots, i have heard of many other solutions.
best of all, you can swallow this toothpaste, which yields all of the amazing health benefits of these detoxifying earth compounds.
many of us have taken our diets and nutrition into our own hands, though when it comes to personal health care, few of us have really stepped out and away from the entrenched medical system’s doctor/dentist treatment, and the role we play in it as “patient” (from the latin meaning “suffering”).
this is particularly perplexing since the pollen of pine trees has been used for millennia in china and korea as both food and a particularly powerful tonic and adaptogen, especially for the elderly.
you can imagine that prior to the widespread use of refrigeration, areas of the world with large apple yields would have had quite a bit of cider on hand, as the juice of fresh apples ferments quite readily.
for the last several years i have talked more about chaga (inonotus obliquus) than any other wild foraged food or medicine.
i have used this strategy, along side others, such as regular sauna use (check out clearlight saunas, it is the brand of infrared sauna that i have in my home), a clean whole food diet containing lots of wild foods and herbs,drinking natural spring water, implimenting regular functional exercise, all combined with and tied together with time spent in nature.
not only is this book the most useful and user friendly i have seen on the subject, but by purchasing it you are directly supporting the preservation of remaining wild places in a radical new way, by educating people how to care for and interface with wild nature.
they can throw you down, clean you up, send you out to space, thrust you on a new paths, make you change your ways, whisper advice, keep you warm, dry, sheltered, alive, and in some cases, even kill you.
it has been working very well for me, and it just might work for you too.
for me it is a place where i shed yet another layer of domestication and re-member what it means to behuman.
you will gain tremendous knowledge and be supporting a wonderful and important cause.
an open source invitation into deeper relation with the many things that fuel, heal, and energize us; that which is alive all around us, co-createswith us.
i have just finished preparing my presentation, called “habitat, your guide to intentional lifestyle design” which will focus on specific strategies for more than just vigorous health, but epi-genetic wealth.
you can check out lots of my past interviews with him (as well as hundreds of other amazing guests) in hisextensive audio archives .
for those of you who are interested in going deeper, i would highly recommend an e-book by my good friend nadine artemis called “successful self-dentistry, how to avoid the dentist without ignoring your teeth”.
and if we can do that–a big task, no doubt–then the way people interact with the world and the spirits of the world and universe will change, automatically, from one of dominance to one of cooperation.

to compliment and expand on my video, i have also included a video with botanist arthur haines detailing how he taps his maples, and prepares his maple syrup.
turning simple sugars into ethanol, amino acids, and b complex vitamins, not to mention a culturally and ritually significant inebriant is a nearly ubiquitous human behavior, and part of what holds the fabric of traditional societies together.
soaking in these waters in the cold desert night looking deep into space is a gift that few ever give themselves!
and while we use the term “intoxicant” to refer to drinks that contain alcohol, these people didn’t associate their sacred beverages with “toxicity” at all.
for this reason i will continue to promote sovereign self-health care strategies here at danielvitalis.com.
nettle root contains compunds that bind to shbg taking the place of testosterone and thereby keeping free testosterone in the blood.
it is the open, clear, and relaxed sense of breathing; the ability to fully utilize your respiration that makes you conscious of its importance.
the experience of procuring food directly from wild nature is truly, for me at least, one of the great joys of living!
while the aerial parts of the plant (the parts that grow above the ground) are most commonly eaten as a pot herb (cooked) or made into infusions (teas), it is the roots from which we can extract its potent androgenic substances.
i am honored to share my knowledge and experience of my many years of visiting this land, with all of the retreaters!
* in addition, daniel vitalis personally assimilated the depth of the respectful and non cult atmosphere that we have created at wilbur.
also, check out our friends at rawnatureboy.com to get an exclusive package deal on sun warrior protein powder, surthrival colostrum & immortal velvet deer antler!!!
this has proven an interesting and valuable endeavor, and i am constantly amazed to discover the source of the foods that i grew up on.
this is because of a curing process used with commercially prepared “wild rice” that causes the grains to become very hard and locks in some of the unpleasantly strong flavors.
i love drinking it this way throughout the day, and like saving the older, dryer, and “harder” cider for the evenings with dinner and after.
while many people use probiotic supplements in an attempt to achieve these ends, most often lacto-fermented foods perform these tasks better, can be made at home from whole, fresh, local foods, are inexpensive, and add a considerable amount of quality nutrition in the form of highly absorbable predigested, living food.
duringplant dietas, one is isolated, eats very little, and/or very simply, in order to remove distractions, sensitize one’s body/mind/spirit to the subtleties of the spirit world, to become transparent, lucid and focused in it.
here is some information on that healing smelly substance.
now that i am just weeks away from surthrival’s launch of its new pine pollen extracts, i wanted to share a video that is yet one more piece of my natural hormone maintnance strategy.
yet, this oasis isgreen and lush, surrounded by inhospitablegravel-strewn desert.
check out the video interview below to learn more about the book, and click here to get your copy now!
the toxic cations are then transported out of our bodies, along with the zeolite powder in our bowel movement.
rather, and more vital to our personal healing – as well as to the continuation of life as we know it – is our becoming acquainted with the organism producing the food or medicine itself.
arthur shares a very eloquent response; “it does at first seem like an odd statement that collecting wild plants can actually benefit the ecosystem.
as i began experimenting with tissue detoxification using zeolites and clay, it dawned on me that these, when rendered into a fine flour-like powder, have just the right amount of abrasiveness to take the place of the toothpaste i had grown up with.
and if we can do that–a big task, no doubt–then the way people interact with the world and the spirits of the world and universe will change, automatically, from one of dominance to one of cooperation.
it is the strengthened engagement with the harmony of humanity – the beautiful songs we’ve sung and are singing, our peak performance, the best of the best – that boils down to our collective necessities – food, medicine, life – from which can be drawn ever-expanding analogies, inter-elated metaphor, and metamorphosis.
we are less than a month away, so if you would like to join us – by us i mean the very amazing and interesting group of people who have assembled for this trip – contactjeannette at info@rawflora.com, and check out the 11 day 10 night itinerary here.
and when we, mankind, begin interacting with the world, rather than trying to dominate it, well, i think mankind will be better off.
each day we are all breathing the many stow-away particles (read: pollutants) that free float amongst what was once, some pretty fresh air here on planet earth.
you can learn a lot from arugula – even more from cacao, or from an elder like maize.
if you are anything like me, you consume enough books that they could be considered part of your diet!
the simultaneous use and conservation of nature requires far more knowledge and skill than simply leaving nature alone.
hot springs, waterfalls, coca,cacao, wild food and wild medicine, and yes, even an optional ayahuasca ceremony!
for me it is a place where i shed yet another layer of domestication and re-member what it means to behuman.
arthur writes from a place of profound understanding of the nutritional and medicinal actions of wild foods, as well as the important uses that these 95 plants held for the native people of this continent (and still do for the “neo-aboriginal” today).
in the meantime, check out the video below to see the harvest and processing of these beautifully blush bunches of berries!
the experience of procuring food directly from wild nature is truly, for me at least, one of the great joys of living!
if you are looking for a riveting adventure, are interested in peruvian shamanism, amazonian biology, visiting machu pichu, or just wanting to soak in a rain forest hotspring, this trip might be for you.
these particles are constantly lodging in and congesting our upper respiratory tract, creating an environment for infection and/or being drawn still deeper into our lower respiratory tract (our lungs).
my company surthrival recently started carrying what we feel are the most beautiful and durable ceramic neti pots available anywhere, andyou can get one for yourself right here on our newly designed website (we are pretty excited about this)!
your feedback is crucial to us, and we really do love hearing from you.
the case with clay is very similar, though the phenomena in this case is referred to as adsorption, which is also an electrical binding, but in this case to the surface of the clay particle and without the accompanying exchange of a cation.
their constant quest instead was securing the macronutrient (carbohydrate, lipid, and protein calories) that they required for their huge daily energy expenditures.
the softness is like that of the most perfectly cooked white rice but with all the nutritious nutty flavors of a wild intact grain.
my experience has been that you can only truly feel the chronic congestion after you have cleared it.
if your looking to smog proof your sinuses, help to prevent sinus issues in general, and improve your respiratory health, give the neti pot a try.
from my perspective, it appears that a diet that lacks the geophagy pattern could not be called a “natural diet” at all, as it would essentially be deficient in these all-important compounds.
working safely and respectfully with ayahuasca and other teacher plants, alongside raw food/garden-variety plants, the teacher’s assistants so to speak, leads, of course, to many physical and spiritual benefits.
also, i want to let you know that though this book was written for plants of the north east, dozens of the plants here will  be found throughout north america, and even beyond.
the behavior is termed“geophagy”, and is unquestionably part of the species-specific diet of human beings.
* in addition, daniel vitalis personally assimilated the depth of the respectful and non cult atmosphere that we have created at wilbur.
trust me, it will help.
stephen, having studied pine pollen extensively, had much to share on the subject.
this is your chance to meet the superfoods, medicinal herbs, and psychoactive plants of south america right there where they live and grow!
in a portion of her response lauren’s says “i don’t understand how harvesting wild food can “benefit the ecosystem”.
ok, a little caveat, we might not actually add the probiotic, but rather let it colonize itself, in what is called a “wild fermentation”, as is the case here with sauerkraut.
while i hadn’t had personal experience with this plant before, i do have plenty of experience with the principles of wild food identification, harvest, and processing, and each of these skills translate well from biome to biome, from one eco-system to the next.
this is in fact where my very first youtube video was recorded, and the place where i began my career.
cider is so easy to produce at homea cave man could do it!
all around it salt crystals grow right up out of the ground, dusting the area like a fresh snow!
in other words, we can use our environment and lifestyle to activate our genetic potential for a more robust experience of life on earth!
the second will focus on the creation of fire from friction, using natural materials from the landscape, the way it was done for the last 400,000 years.
i eventually engaged and evolved my raw food/living diet path as a kind of inverted version of aplant dieta.
our ability to generate and maintain fire is a powerful thing indeed, so it is our intention to pass on not just the skill, but the ethics of stewardship as well.
the roll of shamanic knowledge for us westerners introduced to those spirits is to spread that knowledge, make communication easier.
the last two weekend events we hosted in maine turned out to be game-changers for nearly everyone involved.
from “organic” store-bought toothpaste brands, to tooth soaps and powders, and even aboriginal “chew sticks” – nothing has been the right fit for my self-dentistry needs.
one of the things i really appreciate about it is that it is written as more than just a wild food guide, it is a plant medicine guide as well,
it is less hot and more like tepid bathwater… i enjoy this pool for exercise and play!
i eventually engaged and evolved my raw food/living diet path as a kind of inverted version of aplant dieta.
the primary fermentative organism present in these kinds of preserves is  lactobacillus acidophilus (who’s name means “acid loving milk bacteria”) one of our bodies primary microbial symbionts.
my company,surthrival, became the first to bring a fully developed pine pollen product line to the natural foods market place in north america.
the neti pot gives us the ability to clean our upper respiratory tract, in much the same way that a toothbrush cleans our mouth or a shower washes our skin, before these particles can accumulate or be drawn deeper.
i have personally been witness to it in my own life amongst people that i love dearly.
the film exposes the myths and mistruths that the diet-fad and processed food industries have perpetrated on a mis-educated populace for so many years.
when he wants to eat wild rice he doesn’t go to the market or health food store, he goes to into the wilds!
there are plenty of micronutrients in the foods that i forage from my ecosystem, but most of my actual caloric needs still come from my local farm.
the first video covers proper drying and storage of the chaga mushroom and preparing a decoction, with the 2nd & 3rd videos being a detailed, step by step instruction on creating an elixir, using the wild-harvested chaga tea as a base.
the second will focus on the creation of fire from friction, using natural materials from the landscape, the way it was done for the last 400,000 years.
we are less than a month away, so if you would like to join us – by us i mean the very amazing and interesting group of people who have assembled for this trip – contactjeannette at info@rawflora.com, and check out the 11 day 10 night itinerary here.
spending time witharthur haines has propelled my wild nutrition path forward in ways i am so grateful for.
for me, lacto-ferments like sauerkraut are one of my primary ways of preserving and consuming local vegetables through out the long maine winters.
essentially though, it is process of healing and strengthening.
duringplant dietas, one is isolated, eats very little, and/or very simply, in order to remove distractions, sensitize one’s body/mind/spirit to the subtleties of the spirit world, to become transparent, lucid and focused in it.
the initial fermentation stage is wonderful, as the cider develops its sparkling effervescence.
daily comm-union, even telepathy, most often one-way, where a plant invited into the human body as food or medicine can “see what you mean”.
nettle root contains compunds that bind to shbg taking the place of testosterone and thereby keeping free testosterone in the blood.
his grounded and well researched teachings on nutrition and the environmental and psychological impacts of our diets have earned him tremendous respect as and author and authority on the subject (he’s a professor of journalism at the university of california, berkeley).
when we eat and drink – we practice relationship with different forces, with spirits and sentience.
these next 3 videos are the follow up from the last post entitled “stalking the wild chaga”.
for instance, lacto-fermentaion actually increases the amount of nutrition that was present in the vegetable alone (by converting sugars into protein rich bacterial bodies, b vitamins, and omega 3 fatty acids), increase the bio-availability of the existing nutrition (by breaking down cell walls by predigesting the vegetables cellulose, and removing anti-nutrients) and all the while preserving the inherent nutrition better than freezing, canning, or drying!
not only does lactobacillus acidophilus allow us to preserve and even increase the amount of nutrition in our vegetables, but it also aids in digestion and increases our immunity too!
each day we are all breathing the many stow-away particles (read: pollutants) that free float amongst what was once, some pretty fresh air here on planet earth.
as each season goes by and my skills in this area increase, not only have i developed a strong sense of food security, my direct relationship to the earth as an abundant and loving provider continues to increases.
the first video covers proper drying and storage of the chaga mushroom and preparing a decoction, with the 2nd & 3rd videos being a detailed, step by step instruction on creating an elixir, using the wild-harvested chaga tea as a base.
the main focus of this retreat is to share theancient and ancestral skill of aboriginal friction fire with all of those who attend.
i really feel that this movie has the potential to make some real change in the lives of people you know, so please turn your friends and loved ones onto it as well!
this will be a fun call, and patrick is never shy about taking me into edgy and interesting territory!
we add to that the “probiotic” organism (these are healthy, symbiotic micro-organisms) that will be performing the fermentation (here it will be lactobacillus).
the exotic sweet and spicy aromatic flavor of these brittle pink berries was well worth the risk, and i was certain i was on the trail of a new wild food ally.
after years of hosting events and retreats, we have learned what powerful transformational tools these kinds of workshops can be.
while you may not need nettle root as a medicine for yourself, its highly likely you know a man who does.
this e-book is very comprehensive, and empowers us to take our dental health into our own hands for a lifetime.
most of us brush our teeth and we usually expect the same of others.
while i have also been fermenting honey with some success (a beverage called mead), i wanted to brew something with a milder effect (mead has the alcohol content of wine, upwards of 16 % or more) that could be done with very little labor or input, just the way our ancestors had done it.
the brazilian pink peppercorn tampa bay was the site of another example of an urban forage, and this time with an exotic invasive that produces more food than i could ever hope to harvest.
in fact, if you know where to look, you could get everything you would need for making all the toothpaste you would use for the rest of your life for probably under $100!
abstract learning about nature (i.e., learning that doesn’t involve interaction and use) doesn’t accurately portray the value of different species.
something i could practice daily as a way to learn from, and build relations with numerous “common” plants like kale, chard, chia, blueberries, tomatoes, pears, for example.
there is no other place on earth that leaves me feeling so connected to the land and to the elements!
and don’t forget to check out the mead making workshop that i have coming up next week.
i will be leading a tour of the sacred grounds of eden, visiting along the tour the six geo-thermal hot springs that spot the land.
i will be talking about everything from the “best foods available in the super-market” to the “ worst food that people are eating today“.
given the drive for new plant medicines and the continual search for a new herb-of-the-day that will simulate excitement in the general populace (e.g. rhodiola, maca), it is astonishing that pine has been unrecognized for so long.
it was a tremendous honor to be a part of the new documentary film “hungry for change”.
*topical treatments* used alone, creams and ointments that you apply to your skin can effectively treat mild to moderate psoriasis.

before trying truly wild rice, i was familiar only with the store bought, paddy cultivated wild rice which, though wonderful in flavor and rich in nutrition, just simply pales in comparison.
this “look but don’t touch” attitude toward nature has been applied too extensively, and many mistakenly believe that all wild beings are better off without any human interaction.
null null most of us were taught to spit our toothpaste out, which, given the host of less-than-beneficial ingredients (particularly fluoride) is pretty sound advice.
lacto-fermentation, the kind of vegetable fermentation that produces foods like sauerkraut (as well as kimchee and brined pickles), preserves our food in lactic acid, and was one of the dominant preservation techniques used by our ancestors before sugar and preservatives became the norm.
the softness is like that of the most perfectly cooked white rice but with all the nutritious nutty flavors of a wild intact grain.
these wonderful drinks were both relatively low in alcohol, with probably just a bit less than a modern beer, and loaded with nutrition and calories, making them as much a food as a drink.
then there was also this document which mentions springs of petroleum coming up in the area… now to see if the balneologists know of any theraputic benefit to this naturally occuring compound!
if you can’t make it to the event, but would like to watch the video stream, here isthe link where you can sign up to watch at home.
~d p.s. though saline water is what people usually put in their neti pots, i have heard of many other solutions.
the springs are so deeply nourishing, and there is always a view of the stars like few have ever seen.
“i think that once a person is aware of the life in everything, they can begin to access the spirit of everything.
eating and drinking is intimate communication.
so, this is an official challenge to the kombucha producers and communities to up their game!
while you may not need nettle root as a medicine for yourself, its highly likely you know a man who does.
more than any other medicinal mushroom, this has been my number one herbal/fungal ally.
i really feel that this movie has the potential to make some real change in the lives of people you know, so please turn your friends and loved ones onto it as well!
one of the things i really appreciate about it is that it is written as more than just a wild food guide, it is a plant medicine guide as well, detailing herbal uses of these plants in addition to their uses as foods.
coal tar is available in over-the-counter shampoos, creams and oils.
in particular i am referring to zeolites ability to perform cation exchange -  cec or cation exchange capacity is the term used in physics- which is its ability to electrically bind positively charged ions (heavy metals, radio-isotopes, etc) whilst trading out (in exchange) beneficial cations like potassium or calcium.
we are what we eat, and what we eat runs the show.
i will be facilitating 3 wild food tours in the jungles of peru, august 5th, 19th, and september 2nd!
daniel and i didn’t want to leave you hanging for long without new information posted on the site but daniel is unable to devote any time to his blog for a little while yet as he is on the road and busy spreading the word of shamanic nutrition in california!
the tour is going great and there are several events left if your thinking you’d like to see daniel do his thing live and in person!
arthur writes from a place of profound understanding of the nutritional and medicinal actions of wild foods, as well as the important uses that these 95 plants held for the native people of this continent (and still do for the “neo-aboriginal” today).
this past autumn was a really exciting time for my team and i, with so many of our projects coming to fruition and our message ofrewilding, spring water, and indigenous nutrition spreading around our community and beyond, faster than we ever imagined.
with childlike enthusiasm, we have been texting back and forth each day to see how much sap the others trees have produced!
growing in size, staring at our hands, finding our feet, rubbing our eyeballs, mind boggled – immersed, surrounded, and face to face with an overwhelming presence perceived, at times, as threatening.
given the drive for new plant medicines and the continual search for a new herb-of-the-day that will simulate excitement in the general populace (e.g. rhodiola, maca), it is astonishing that pine has been unrecognized for so long.

earlier in the year i had the culturally enriching experience of imbibing some of the traditional fermented beverages of south america, specificallychicha (from maize) and masatao (fromcassava), both traditional ferments of the people of peru.
so it provides certain answers in the form of nourishment – literally; “bringing (you) up, raising, fostering, supporting, preserving”.
this video is a quick peek into my spring cleansing strategy which is most welcomed after a lengthy season of living indoors.
on this interview, daniel will be speaking about his latest research into thereclassification of modern humans as a new subspecies.
and yes, he and his warriors really used this spring for healing and rejuvenation!
i am also very excited to visit the markets and meet the locals!
swimming, bathing, or even just floating here is a truly unique and indescribable experience!

lactobacillus takes up residence in our small intestine, creating a kind of probiotic bio-shield in the gut, where it aggressively out-competes other dys-biotic organisms that can cause us to fall ill.
this water runs down past a pool known as the “emerald pool” which is much hotter than the guitar pool.
and thus far, for most of us throughout mankind’s short history on this planet, that effort has not been made.
as for the technique and specifics, i will let this video explain the rest.
what a wonderful feeling to know that this winter i will be eating more of my calories from foods that were sustainably harvested from my local landscape.
what might appear on the surface to be a wanton act of collection actually represents a gathering system that includes numerous safeguards to protect plants from overharvest.
when this clay or zeolite consumption is combined with sauna therapy (this dual approach is the subject ofmy last video), we arrive at a very effective life-long detoxification strategy that really works, and is easy to implement.
then there was also this document which mentions springs of petroleum coming up in the area… now to see if the balneologists know of any theraputic benefit to this naturally occuring compound!
there will be many amazing work/play shop facilitators, body workers, and many newand old friends… morning yoga, sun gazing, spring water….
this is why my teachings have been focusing in on foods that are bred wisely, or when possible, are wild!
also, this is an excellent resource for herbalists or those interested in herbal medicine, as each plants pharmacology and mode of action are broken down in a very explicit and comprehensible way.
when this clay or zeolite consumption is combined with sauna therapy (this dual approach is the subject ofmy last video), we arrive at a very effective life-long detoxification strategy that really works, and is easy to implement.
with this home-made clay or zeolite toothpaste, the goal is indeed to swallow it, moving it into the intestine where it can go to work mopping up industrial and nuclear debris that has bioaccumulated in our tissues.
more than any other medicinal mushroom, this has been my number one herbal/fungal ally.
storing vegetables for the winter is a critical skill, and lacto-fermentation has some advantages that are hard to beat.
i think the universe has all the secrets of the universe.
they were not viewed as guilt laden pleasures or sources of immoral behavior and debauchery, but rather as sacred and vitally health supportive.
however, the heart of this guidance was clear: ayahuasca, once drank, prefers to live in, and works better with; clean bodies.
i put this up to demonstrate how simple it is to produce your own wild nettle root tincture for use as an herbal medicine.
i think it is an inspired and poignant summation of the plant medicine path, and especially thesynthesis of food, medicine, and the realm of entheogenic plants in the human ecological niche.
the toxic cations are then transported out of our bodies, along with the zeolite powder in our bowel movement.
yet, this oasis isgreen and lush, surrounded by inhospitablegravel-strewn desert.
cider is usually defined as having an alcohol content of 2 – 8.5 % or higher, though my experience is that it tastes great and is incredibly refreshing even during initial fermentation when the alcohol content is negligible like that of kombucha.
this will be a time of powerful healing and lifelong transformation for all who attend.
treatments and drugs by mayo clinic staff psoriasis treatments aim to: - interrupt the cycle that causes an increased production of skin cells, thereby reducing inflammation and plaque formation.
thousands of chinese herbs have entered the western pharmacopoeia; the earliest and best known is perhaps ginseng.
i will be leading a tour of the sacred grounds of eden, visiting along the tour the six geo-thermal hot springs that spot the land.
from yet another direction, the “higher reflection” in a sense themother of raw, living diets, can be seen in the traditions and disciplines ofplant dietas.
this strangely clad and barefoot historical figure was committed to much more than just growing apples.
and our arrogance in trying to continually conquer the universe rather than communicate with it, has kept us from being taught those secrets.
it has been many years since i have seen a dentist (i was 12 the last time i can remember having an appointment with one), and as it is with so many aspects of living, i have found it far more rewarding to take care of myself, rather than turning my health over to others.
you cannot see this black material in the hot water since it is dissolved; however, you can smell a very mild petroleum like odor in wilbur's medicinal mineral water along with the smell of sulfur, a well known, and established, anti bacterial agent.
how i arrived at this… as i began experimenting with tissue detoxification using zeolites and clay, it dawned on me that these, when rendered into a fine flour-like powder, have just the right amount of abrasiveness to take the place of the toothpaste

further, pollan suggests, in his “plants-eye view” ted talk, that “looking at the world from other species’ points of view is a cure for the disease of human self-importance.”
despite this, and even because of it, nettle has been used as food and medicine by many cultures and is an important species for those of us who practice foraging, herbalism, or primitive outdoor skills.
the photos are very clear and the descriptions have been written by someone who has actually used the plants to the ends described therein (believe me, this is not the norm).
i’m talking about the spirit of the creek, the bricks in your house, the hundreds of spirits roaming your kitchen.
in contrast to many wild foraged plants, wild rice requires a more considerable amount of know how and equipment to locate, access, harvest, and process, so to show this in its entirety is simply outside the scope of a blog post.
daniel will be sharing tips on the kinds of things a person can do to rewild themselves and what it could mean to our health.
that is all changing for me now that i have learned to forage a few key items, perhaps the greatest and most important, of which is wild rice.
we add to that the “probiotic” organism (these are healthy, symbiotic micro-organisms) that will be performing the fermentation (here it will be lactobacillus).
aside from the vegetables that keep in my cellar (onions, squashes, garlic) and the vegetables i have frozen (wild fiddle heads, japanese knotweed) lacto-ferments are my main source of “living” vegetation.
we are what we eat, and what we eat runs the show.
now that i am just weeks away from surthrival’s launch of its new pine pollen extracts, i wanted to share a video that is yet one more piece of my natural hormone maintnance strategy.
there will be many amazing work/play shop facilitators, body workers, and many newand old friends… morning yoga, sun gazing, spring water….
i have just finished preparing my presentation, called “habitat, your guide to intentional lifestyle design” which will focus on specific strategies for more than just vigorous health, but epi-genetic wealth.
through this quest i have become enamoured by cider, which is the proper name for the fermented alcoholic draught made from the fresh pressed juice from apples.
wild rice however, is a complex carbohydrate (macro-nutrient), and unlike the mono-cropped and refined carbohydrates of the average american diet, is a rich whole food grain loaded with vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) as well.
from “organic” store-bought toothpaste brands, to tooth soaps and powders, and even aboriginal “chew sticks” – nothing has been the right fit for my self-dentistry needs.
most americans are deficient in micronutrients even to the rda standard (recommended daily allowances of the u.s. national academy of sciences) which is surprisingly low when compared against the nutrient intakes of so called “primitive peoples”.
essentially, plants can do whatever they want with humans, and with near-absolute impunity.
and our arrogance in trying to continually conquer the universe rather than communicate with it, has kept us from being taught those secrets.
hour after hour i burned to know and meet the species who’s berry drupes splatter painted pink the otherwise indistinguishable wall of sub-tropic greenery that lined the highway 75.
~daniel ps, check out this podcast i recently did where we discuss the history of grains and agriculture, as well as some must have information on making the grains you use a safe and healthy food!
i think that foragers of all skill level and in a variety of eco-ranges will benefit from this work.
they were not viewed as guilt laden pleasures or sources of immoral behavior and debauchery, but rather as sacred and vitally health supportive.
aside from the occasional whole foods splurge, i don’t suspect i will be eating very many fresh green vegetables until the wild spring shoots emerge after the thaw.
plant-based edible living sculpture with vibrant living beings who in return sculpt you.
actually, it is common to nearly all mammals, and in particular to broad ranging herbivores.
it is so great to get them locally and for the amazing prices that can only be had on such a visit!
this online workshop will delve deeply into human domestication and the affects of an alkaloid-poor diet.
there is a globulin in human blood calledsex hormone binding globulin (shbg) which binds to testosterone, rendering it unavailable to the our cells.
this is so strange because we tend to, as a culture, consider the apple the very symbol of “natural food”.
this video comes on the heels of the last video we released, which details how to make the toothpaste that is used in this dental care strategy.
it is also an excellentblended drink or soup base.
swimming, bathing, or even just floating here is a truly unique and indescribable experience!
if this wasn’t enough, phyto-chemicals in nettle root further work to prevent benign prostate hyperplasia (bph) by stopping the binding of dht to the prostate membrane.
in particular i am referring to zeolites ability to perform cation exchange - cec or cation exchange capacity is the term used in physics- which is its ability to electrically bind positively charged ions (heavy metals, radio-isotopes, etc) whilst trading out (in exchange) beneficial cations like potassium or calcium.

the results are his latest book which you can find here.
and yes, he and his warriors really used this spring for healing and rejuvenation!
and once they can do that they can interact with those spirits.
his grounded and well researched teachings on nutrition and the environmental and psychological impacts of our diets have earned him tremendous respect as and author and authority on the subject (he’s a professor of journalism at the university of california, berkeley).
it is also known as the “goddess pool”, because the pool imitates the curvy shape of a woman’s body.
i have had the opportuntiy to forage wild foods for a few years now, with each season yielding greater and greater amounts of food.
this is your chance to meet the superfoods, medicinal herbs, and psychoactive plants of south america right there where they live and grow!
when standing on the hill, the high point of the property, surrounded by the 360 degrees of arizona mountains, looking down at the valley, the magick of this place becomes clear.
to say that i am grateful would hardly do justice to this exuberant emotion.
-morgan brent all plants are psychoactive.
to compliment and expand on my video, i have also included a video with botanist arthur haines detailing how he taps his maples, and prepares his maple syrup.
as i began to contemplate this, i realized i didn’t have a reference point for naturally occurring “rock oil”.
and yet so much of the fruits we eat are cloned, and few of us are even aware.
as an example, most of us find the idea of cloning sheep or humans strange.
a black, tar like, material can be seen in the mud around the wilbur hot springs source springs.
further, pollan suggests, in his “plants-eye view” ted talk, that “looking at the world from other species’ points of view is a cure for the disease of human self-importance.”
in fact, learning to properly construct and burn a fire has meant far more to me than just having another survival skill.
it may be hard to perceive because we simply don’t interact with wild plants as traditional cultures did, which means we lack the knowledge base to understand our role in the ecology of these organisms.
of course the beverages fermented by native peoples and by our traditional cultural forebearers were much healthier and nutritionally viable than those of today, created with local ingredients and wild yeasts, and were not filtered and pasturized like the ones that most of us were raised around.
when we gather edible seeds and seed-like fruits, we unintentionally scatter or drop some of them, helping the plant to disperse further than it would have otherwise.
if you are woman reading this pay close attention.
there are of course wonderful uses for chaga with its bark on as well, particularly as an anti-neoplastic medicine.
this means that as a forager i am still largely dependent on my local agricultural system to provide me with calories that i need to live out my daily life.
also, this is an excellent resource for herbalists or those interested in herbal medicine, as each plants pharmacology and mode of action are broken down in a very explicit and comprehensible way.
for those who don’t know, chaga is a fungal sclerotium with notable anti-cancer  terpines (such as betulinic acid) and immune system modulating sugars (called beta glucans).
also, i want to let you know that though this book was written for plants of the north east, dozens of the plants here will be found throughout north america, and even beyond.

the scoby, often called the “mother” is placed into the tea where it (the yeast and bacteria) ferment the feed on the sugars and phytonutrients of the tea, fermenting it into the drink we call kombucha.
whats more, the flowing sap of the maple tree is the first wild food to emerge after a long and cold snow covered new england winter.
it inhabits the shallow waters of lakes, ponds, and slow moving rivers.
the primary fermentative organism present in these kinds of preserves is lactobacillus acidophilus (who’s name means “acid loving milk bacteria”) one of our bodies primary microbial symbionts.
the roll of shamanic knowledge for us westerners introduced to those spirits is to spread that knowledge, make communication easier.
plants, and plant-time, are like crop circles (which of course are made of plants in most cases) – like magic, they appear, leave traces, clues, fruit, messages.
for those of you who are interested in going deeper, i would highly recommend an e-book by my good friend nadine artemis called “successful self-dentistry, how to avoid the dentist without ignoring your teeth”.
invite the forces of nature, say an orange or a mushroom, and with the right kind of eyes – grow further infused with infinite ecologies of everlasting spirits.
i put this up to demonstrate how simple it is to produce your own wild nettle root tincture for use as an herbal medicine.
something i could practice daily as a way to learn from, and build relations with numerous “common” plants like kale, chard, chia, blueberries, tomatoes, pears, for example.
in fact the modern apple scarcely resembles the true wild apple in taste, size, or nutritional profile.
this online workshop will delve deeply into human domestication and the affects of an alkaloid-poor diet.
the plants led me out of concrete jungles, cured any concrete ideologies and crumbling health i might carry – hold my gaze and engage my commitment to unfolding endeavors of evolutionary advantage – wild foods, living water, permaculture, forest gardening, medicinal mushrooms, herbalism, synaesthesia…

i want to emphasize, the synbiotic is a new food, not the sum of the original parts, this is why sauerkraut is not “cabbage”, and wine is not “grape juice”.
it reduces scaling, itching and inflammation.
this video is for all of you who celebrate being grown-ups, and are unafraid to raise yourselves up and out of the near ubiquitousneoteny that is now standard in the epi-genome in our “modernized” population.
however, the heart of this guidance was clear: ayahuasca, once drank, prefers to live in, and works better with; clean bodies.
the apple juice i have worked with begins to ferment almost immediately after it reaches room temperature, and in truth gets better each and every day that it sits.
the experience of eden is always hot, sunny, fiery energy… burning off the old to make room for the new.
finally curiosity got the better of me, and i decided to do what any avid forager would –  i  pulled over to have a taste.

and while this presents ecological issues in southern florida, it produces a tremendous surplus of wild food for the keenly aware forager.
native american practices have been shown to increase the abundance of certain species even though lethal collection was being performed.
while i hadn’t had personal experience with this plant before, i do have plenty of experience with the principles of wild food identification, harvest, and processing, and each of these skills translate well from biome to biome, from one eco-system to the next.

please keep in mind that this toothpaste, in addition to providing the mild abrasive qualities we have become accustomed to in our commercially available toothpaste preparations, is designed to pull toxic cations out of the body, and to be an aid in our overall radio-protection strategy (protection from radioactive isotopes).
their cafe in sedona is definitely the hot spot of the area and is a must visit while going through that town!
which has left us losing out on so much we might have learned.
the tour is going great and there are several events left if your thinking you’d like to see daniel do his thing live and in person!
the class has been filling up rather quickly these last few weeks, and we are getting very excited for the spring foraging to begin!
most of the wild plants that i have been learning to use are incredibly nutritious (as well as delicious) but a bit low in calories.
many wild foraged plants are eaten like vegetables (stinging nettle come to mind) but lack the energy density that we get from meats, grains, oils, concentrated sugars.
in the new orleans “jungleland” – behind climates of chaos and the media newsfeed, burnt cars and dead bodies are consumed by tall grass.
many of us, in fact, might even have a moral repulsion to the idea.

null null most of us were taught to spit our toothpaste out, which, given the host of less-than-beneficial ingredients (particularly fluoride) is pretty sound advice.
hand harvested, sundried, fire parched, foot treaded, and wind winnowed wild rice is so soft and delicate in flavor that it simply has to be tasted to be understood.

i have now arrived at a strategy that is really working wonders for me, and i feel could really work for you too.
there are not many wild foods that taste particularly sweet here in new england, but maple syrup is certainly the exception.
most americans are deficient in micronutrients even to the rda standard (recommended daily allowances of the u.s. national academy of sciences) which is surprisingly low when compared against the nutrient intakes of so called “primitive peoples”.
organisms native to the area where you are fermenting, or – as is the case with cabbage – are indigenous to the food itself.

“what ayahuasca teaches is that right now, at every moment, we already live in the magic forest.”
in other words, once you have tried it and felt what clean and clear sinus cavities feel like, you won’t want to go back.
this film is a beautiful depiction of how that is happening.
our ability to generate and maintain fire is a powerful thing indeed, so it is our intention to pass on not just the skill, but the ethics of stewardship as well.

lacto-fermentation, the kind of vegetable fermentation that produces foods like sauerkraut (as well as kimchee and brined pickles), preserves our food in lactic acid, and was one of the dominant preservation techniques used by our ancestors before sugar and preservatives became the norm.
while each section is amazing, i was most taken by the segment on the apple.

i have used this strategy, along side others, such as regular sauna use (check out clearlight saunas, it is the brand of infrared sauna that i have in my home), a clean whole food diet containing lots of wild foods and herbs,drinking natural spring water, implimenting regular functional exercise, all combined with and tied together with time spent in nature.
the behavior is termed“geophagy”, and is unquestionably part of the species-specific diet of human beings.
our ancestors ate extremely micronutrient dense diets when compared against our own.
this is my favorite pool for soaking, as it is the quietest and most…sanctified.
cider is so easy to produce at homea cave man could do it!
i have had the opportuntiy to forage wild foods for a few years now, with each season yielding greater and greater amounts of food.
the wonderful chocolatree cafe, based out of sedona,will be preparing the food and overseeing the kitchen!
ancestral plants is different, this book just seems to have it all.
the main focus of this retreat is to share theancient and ancestral skill of aboriginal friction fire with all of those who attend.
in fact, when someone neglects this important bit of personal cleanliness, the rest of us can be easily turned off.
these are made right here in the state of maine (where we are based out of) and i have personally tested them now for almost a decade and a half, so i can honestly tell you they are the best around.
this has been, by far, my most prolific year of harvesting wild food and medicine.
working safely and respectfully with ayahuasca and other teacher plants, alongside raw food/garden-variety plants, the teacher’s assistants so to speak, leads, of course, to many physical and spiritual benefits.
click here for the raw flora wild food journey itinerary i am also very excited to visit the markets and meet the locals!
ancestral plants uses a series of icons to denote the possible uses of a plant  (a little fire icon for plants with fire uses, an arrow for plants with uses in archery, etc), and then the text details how, when, and which parts of a plant can be used in this way.
most of the wild plants that i have been learning to use are incredibly nutritious (as well as delicious) but a bit low in calories.
they provide an exotic spiciness to any dish, from sweet to savory, and they come with the added percieved benefit of being from my own personal harvest.
earlier in the year i had the culturally enriching experience of imbibing some of the traditional fermented beverages of south america, specificallychicha (from maize) and masatao (fromcassava), both traditional ferments of the people of peru.
fermentation can seem a bit intimidating when you haven’t tried it before, and that is why i am posting this video.
these wonderful drinks were both relatively low in alcohol, with probably just a bit less than a modern beer, and loaded with nutrition and calories, making them as much a food as a drink.
their cafe in sedona is definitely the hot spot of the area and is a must visit while going through that town!
i had met stephen at a workshop he gave in british columbia (here is an interview i did with him) and having become friends, asked if he would be willing to collaborate with myself and the surthrival team on a pine pollen herbal-monograph.
this is why my teachings have been focusing in on foods that are bred wisely, or when possible, are wild!
the springs are so deeply nourishing, and there is always a view of the stars like few have ever seen.
in fact, learning to properly construct and burn a fire has meant far more to me than just having another survival skill.
plants, i’ve found, often speak in terms of one’s present perception – in shapeshifting symbols that change as you follow them, conversations to discern and decipher.
to ensure the continued integrity of this site and the quality experience that it provides for our users, we now post all comments on an approval-first basis.
my company,surthrival, became the first to bring a fully developed pine pollen product line to the natural foods market place in north america.
stinging nettle (urtica dioica) is an herbaceous perennial flowering plant known by many of us for the painful stinging hairs (they are actually called “trichomes”) that inject histamine into our skin like micro hypodermic needles.
the thing we intend to ferment is known as a “prebiotic” (i am using this term loosely, don’t tell the scientists), this is the food source (sugars) for the organisms that will be converting the food into a fermented-food (in our case cabbage).
because our epi-genetics are influenced by everything in our environment, the lifestyle we have lived has shaped us into some new and all together different creature.
i really appreciated her stepping up to ask because i know that i (and much of my generation) was raised to believe that we are inherently, by our very nature, damaging to ecosystems.
eating and drinking is intimate communication.
check out this 12 minute video clip (click on the image below) of the talk i delivered in costa mesa last october titled, “developing sovereign health: the path of  rewilding ourselves”.
herbal steam baths, guided hikes through forests and eco-gardens, native markets, and lodging in peru’s eco-friendly manu learning center!
for those who don’t know, chaga is a fungal sclerotium with notable anti-cancer terpines (such as betulinic acid) and immune system modulating sugars (called beta glucans).
peruvian alpaca garments are the best in the world, and my poncho, hat and gloves all come from there.
homo sapiens have a long and rich history with psychoactive plant medicines, and they have always been a part of our traditional diets.
peruvian alpaca garments are the best in the world, and my poncho, hat and gloves all come from there.
yet perhaps most importantly, the process has opened, and continues to expand, a certain grandpermeability – pathways and bridges between common ground and the sky – between day-to-day and ceremonial nights.
this will be a time of powerful healing and lifelong transformation for all who attend.
storing vegetables for the winter is a critical skill, and lacto-fermentation has some advantages that are hard to beat.
the experience of eden is always hot, sunny, fiery energy… burning off the old to make room for the new.
my hope is that our community will immediately see the value of this handy little device and add it to the tool-belt of practices and skills that are helping us to thrive in, and adapt to our modern environment.
we have chosen the intimate class size to ensure that each of you gets the close personal attention you need, and to ensure that we don’t trample our wild foraging grounds.
rather, and more vital to our personal healing – as well as to the continuation of life as we know it – is our becoming acquainted with the organism producing the food or medicine itself.
actually, i was reading a few of his books and found myself particularly spellbound by the section on pine pollen and its incredible androgenic effects.
this workshop will be fully catered with organic, local food, prepared by chef frank giglio, who is one of my best friends and a truly culinary mentor of mine.
aside from the vegetables that keep in my cellar (onions, squashes, garlic) and the vegetables i have frozen (wild fiddle heads, japanese knotweed) lacto-ferments are my main source of “living” vegetation.
our ancestors ate extremely micronutrient dense diets when compared against our own.
what a wonderful feeling to know that this winter i will be eating more of my calories from foods that were sustainably harvested from my local landscape.
and thus far, for most of us throughout mankind’s short history on this planet, that effort has not been made.
daniel has a bit of an aversion to recipes….. preferring to teach the principles and process of elixircrafting and encouraging people to use their intuition and to create from their own unique palate, so it’s a special treat that he measured everything this time and i was able to put together the recipe for you!

ok, a little caveat, we might not actually add the probiotic, but rather let it colonize itself, in what is called a “wild fermentation”, as is the case here with sauerkraut.
plants, and plant-time, are like crop circles (which of course are made of plants in most cases) – like magic, they appear, leave traces, clues, fruit, messages.
for those of us who are developing or returning to our ancestral health through traditional and indigenous nutritional practices, few food preparation skills are as valuable to possess as lacto-fermentation.
it is 3 days long, catered by chef frank giglio with all local organic and wild food, and taught by myself and wild food expertarthur haines.
i will be talking aboutrewilding and transcending human domestication, and how we can stay strong, healthy, and actively-fit for a lifetime in a world that constantly pushing us towards a deeper state of domestication.
this video is a quick peek into my spring cleansing strategy which is most welcomed after a lengthy season of living indoors.
we really believe that stewardship of this ancient fire-craft is valuable for many reasons, not the least of which is the carrying on of what is one of our most ancient and fundamental human technologies.
i was immediately impressed with the way that these were built into the nutritional and spiritual systems of the area.
this film is a beautiful depiction of how that is happening.
i have a good sense of the tastes of poisons, and this strategy has rarely failed me ( i will spare you the tale of the time i tried a taste of “jack-in-the-pulpit”.
further, experientially learning the uses of wild plants teaches people to value those species while also helping them to become more self-sufficient.
you can check out lots of my past interviews with him (as well as hundreds of other amazing guests) in hisextensive audio archives .
lactobacillus takes up residence in our small intestine, creating a kind of probiotic bio-shield in the gut, where it aggressively out-competes other dys-biotic organisms that can cause us to fall ill.
from my perspective it’s a kind of plant artistry.
as i began to contemplate this, i realized i didn’t have a reference point for naturally occurring “rock oil”.
there are not many wild foods that taste particularly sweet here in new england, but maple syrup is certainly the exception.
it is the strengthened engagement with the harmony of humanity – the beautiful songs we’ve sung and are singing, our peak performance, the best of the best – that boils down to our collective necessities – food, medicine, life – from which can be drawn ever-expanding analogies, inter-elated metaphor, and metamorphosis.
in fact, for much of the year i use it almost daily and have for several years now… chaga is normally decocted (boiled in water to produce a broth or tea) for about two hours, yielding a very mild vanilla like flavor (it containsvanillin as one of its components) which is great to drink on its own, with added cream and a sweetener (i like maple syrup) to create a drink much like coffee.
aside from the occasional whole foods splurge, i don’t suspect i will be eating very many fresh green vegetables until the wild spring shoots emerge after the thaw.
stephen, in addition to being a prolific writer on herbal craft and lore, is a poet and word-smith par excellence.
this strangely clad and barefoot historical figure was committed to much more than just growing apples.
de-barking chaga yields a far more mild, pleasant tasting, less medicinal and more tonic tea.
we strive to put on events that can nourish the body, inform the mind, and touch the spirit.
more than this, it also prevents the conversion of testosterone into a metabolite known as dihydrotestosterone, which has been implicated in benign prostate hyperplasia and even male pattern baldness.
hot springs, waterfalls, coca,cacao, wild food and wild medicine, and yes, even an optional ayahuasca ceremony!
actually, i was reading a few of his books and found myself particularly spellbound by the section on pine pollen and its incredible androgenic effects.
because our epi-genetics are influenced by everything in our environment, the lifestyle we have lived has shaped us into some new and all together different creature.
i had the privilege of both publishing this book as well as writing the foreword, and am very excited to see it added  to the existing herbal literature.
you can learn a lot from arugula – even more from cacao, or from an elder like maize.
organisms native to the area where you are fermenting, or – as is the case with cabbage – are indigenous to the food itself.
this is an acronym for a symbiotic colony of yeast and bacteria, the strange pancake like colony of organisms that float on top of the ferment.
i have now arrived at a strategy that is really working wonders for me, and i feel could really work for you too.
however, there exist many examples showing that conscientious use of plants by people is beneficial for those species.
side with the plants, learn plants, eat plants, become plants – let food be your medicine, let medicine be your food – and begin to synthesize entirely different dimensions of time, technology, communication, and potential.
this video comes on the heels of the last video we released, which details how to make the toothpaste that is used in this dental care strategy.
coal tar has few known side effects, but it's messy, stains clothing and bedding, and has a strong odor.
while many people use probiotic supplements in an attempt to achieve these ends, most often lacto-fermented foods perform these tasks better, can be made at home from whole, fresh, local foods, are inexpensive, and add a considerable amount of quality nutrition in the form of highly absorbable predigested, living food.
in other words, we can use our environment and lifestyle to activate our genetic potential for a more robust experience of life on earth!
ancestral plants uses a series of icons to denote the possible uses of a plant (a little fire icon for plants with fire uses, an arrow for plants with uses in archery, etc), and then the text details how, when, and which parts of a plant can be used in this way.
essentially though, it is process of healing and strengthening.
to say that i am grateful would hardly do justice to this exuberant emotion.
- remove scale and smooth the skin, which is particularly true of topical treatments that you apply to your skin.
for the last several years i have talked more about chaga (inonotus obliquus) than any other wild foraged food or medicine.
you can find all the details and register here.
who knows what we have missed simply by not asking a plant what benefit it might have for mankind, rather than saying “tree, chop it and burn it for fire.”
in other words, once you have tried it and felt what clean and clear sinus cavities feel like, you won’t want to go back.
please keep in mind that this toothpaste, in addition to providing the mild abrasive qualities we have become accustomed to in our commercially available toothpaste preparations, is designed to pull toxic cations out of the body, and to be an aid in our overall radio-protection strategy (protection from radioactive isotopes).
for those of us living in areas where chaga is not readily available we can substitute the chaga tea base with any medicinal teas we are currently working with, keeping in mind that the flavor may vary slightly… but not enough to make that big of a difference.
in truth, kombucha, which most likely hails not from china, but from russia, is tea that has been fermented by a “scoby”.
actually, it is common to nearly all mammals, and in particular to broad ranging herbivores.
“as we begin (once again) to naturalize ourselves – both nutritionally and medicinally – we may begin to discover that there is far more to a plant than just its chemical composition, more than just its list of constituent phyto-nutrients, vitamins and minerals.
no harvest yet has supplied me with the amount of food energy that i was able to gather this september when i learned the ancient art of “ricing”.
this is the go-to book for understanding wild plants of the north east, and the one that will accompany me into the field this year and for years to come (mine is getting dog-eared already).
if plants – specifically teacher plants – convey anything, it is that they have the upper hand, the higher branch.
a black, tar like, material can be seen in the mud around the wilbur hot springs source springs.
no harvest yet has supplied me with the amount of food energy that i was able to gather this september when i learned the ancient art of “ricing”.
i hope this motivates you to get out and harvest some food or medicine for yourself.
de-barking chaga yields a far more mild, pleasant tasting, less medicinal and more tonic tea.
in fact the modern apple scarcely resembles the true wild apple in taste, size, or nutritional profile.
"rewild yourself: tips & tricks for strengthening your epigenetic health" i also want to share this quick video clip of my good friend shailene woodley’s appearance on thelate night with jimmy fallon show (check out that clip right here)!
this will be a fun call, and patrick is never shy about taking me into edgy and interesting territory!
i am honored to share my knowledge and experience of my many years of visiting this land, with all of the retreaters!
shailene has become a tremendous ally, helping to share the message ofrewilding, spring water, and indigenous nutrition with the world.
the plants led me out of concrete jungles, cured any concrete ideologies and crumbling health i might carry – hold my gaze and engage my commitment to unfolding endeavors of evolutionary advantage – wild foods, living water, permaculture, forest gardening, medicinal mushrooms, herbalism, synaesthesia… yet perhaps most importantly, the process has opened, and continues to expand, a certain grandpermeability – pathways and bridges between common ground and the sky – between day-to-day and ceremonial nights.
~ daniel sep 30, 2010 | wild food & water, written word | view comments i will be facilitating 3 wild food tours in the jungles of peru, august 5th, 19th, and september 2nd!
and yet so much of the fruits we eat are cloned, and few of us are even aware.
if your looking to smog proof your sinuses, help to prevent sinus issues in general, and improve your respiratory health, give the neti pot a try.
thats not hype, i have literally been taking it everywhere.
the thing we intend to ferment is known as a “prebiotic” (i am using this term loosely, don’t tell the scientists), this is the food source (sugars) for the organisms that will be converting the food into a fermented-food (in our case cabbage).
though today much of the wild rice sold in the market place is cultivated in rice paddies, this highly nutritious grain is still available to the forager for the price of his or her labor.
the entire book is extensively footnoted so that you can access the scientific literature from which so much of this information has been compiled.
typically the kombucha begins with a steeped tea (literally the tea plant “camellia sinensis”) and white or “unrefined” cane sugar.
synbiotics like sauerkraut have long been used by those before us to fortify their immune systems, assist in digestion (their acidity helps to lower the ph of the stomach increasing the effectiveness of our hydrochloric acid), and to maintain healthy levels of the probiotic organisms that colonize our digestive lumen.
it is the open, clear, and relaxed sense of breathing; the ability to fully utilize your respiration that makes you conscious of its importance.
they are a business of high integrity, bringing us the most top notch organic vegetarian cuisine!
through the alchemy of the fermentative process something new will be created, and that new thing is known as the “synbiotic”.
i have personally been witness to it in my own life amongst people that i love dearly.
i have seen small kombucha projects where honey, agave, and other alternative sugar sources have been used, but they ultimately are less functional than sucrose.
otherwise, we simply carry this debris around, haphazardly sneezing or blowing it out, or letting it drain back into our throats…
it inhabits the shallow waters of lakes, ponds, and slow moving rivers.
otherwise, we simply carry this debris around, haphazardly sneezing or blowing it out, or letting it drain back into our throats…  blah!
on this interview, daniel will be speaking about his latest research into thereclassification of modern humans as a new subspecies.
i promise if you give it just one week of consistent practice, not only will you easily master this skill, but you will have a life long practice that will contribute to your health and personal detoxification strategy.
this means that as a forager i am still largely dependent on my local agricultural system to provide me with calories that i need to live out my daily life.
turning simple sugars into ethanol, amino acids, and b complex vitamins, not to mention a culturally and ritually significant inebriant is a nearly ubiquitous human behavior, and part of what holds the fabric of traditional societies together.
wild rice however, is a complex carbohydrate (macro-nutrient), and unlike the mono-cropped and refined carbohydrates of the average american diet, is a rich whole food grain loaded with vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) as well.
whats more, the flowing sap of the maple tree is the first wild food to emerge after a long and cold snow covered new england winter.
for instance, lacto-fermentaion actually increases the amount of nutrition that was present in the vegetable alone (by converting sugars into protein rich bacterial bodies, b vitamins, and omega 3 fatty acids), increase the bio-availability of the existing nutrition (by breaking down cell walls by predigesting the vegetables cellulose, and removing anti-nutrients) and all the while preserving the inherent nutrition better than freezing, canning, or drying!
simply gathering bulbs after the seeds had formed would allow the plant to germinate in freshly tilled earth.
into which, ayahuasca digs deep, purging junk, transforming thoughts, composting things, creating soil from soul, turning the stomach into a womb, encouraging conditions right, good, and fertile – so it can root, grow, and flower.
so it’s really up to us to take an interest if we are to make the friendship of those spirits.
homo sapiens have a long and rich history with psychoactive plant medicines, and they have always been a part of our traditional diets.
it’s a great place to stock up on great winter immune system supplements, such as medicinal mushroom extracts and colostrum.
this has been, by far, my most prolific year of harvesting wild food and medicine.
gorman apr 06, 2012 | audio podcasts, current projects, interviews, wild food & water, written word | view comments it was a tremendous honor to be a part of the new documentary film “hungry for change”.
watch the video above where i compare some of the features against other design-styles.
this past autumn was a really exciting time for my team and i, with so many of our projects coming to fruition and our message ofrewilding, spring water, and indigenous nutrition spreading around our community and beyond, faster than we ever imagined.
i will be facilitating this experience, along side master shamanic qi gong practitioner jeannette kielo dussel, and the team of shamans, ecologists, and native food and medicine experts who have been assembled for this once in a lifetime experience!
further, we have been taught to “take only pictures, leave only footprints.”
my hope is that our community will immediately see the value of this handy little device and add it to the tool-belt of practices and skills that are helping us to thrive in, and adapt to our modern environment.
ancestral plants finally, a wild food and medicine book that really delivers!
they are a business of high integrity, bringing us the most top notch organic vegetarian cuisine!
without repeated disturbance, the area will eventually grow in with taller plants that will shade out the evening-primrose, leading to a loss of that species at that site.
one of the great things about a plant like this, is there there is no concern of over harvest.
"rewild yourself: tips & tricks for strengthening your epigenetic health" i also want to share this quick video clip of my good friend shailene woodley’s appearance on thelate night with jimmy fallon show (check out that clip right here)!
it’s true, the apple tree as we think of it is a grafted plant, and its fruit is exceptionally hybridized.
their constant quest instead was securing the macronutrient (carbohydrate, lipid, and protein calories) that they required for their huge daily energy expenditures.
keep in mind that this practice, consuming clay and other earth compounds, is perhaps one of the oldest of all human behaviors.

pine pollen, given its potency, its similarity to ginseng in some of its actions, and its status as, perhaps,the premier phytoandrogen on the planet, should have been recognized long before now as the powerful medicinal it is.
more than that, it also lays out which plants may be useful as a fire resource (for friction fire, tinder etc), for cordage (plants that contain fibers that can be removed and braided in to cord), archery uses (woods that are optimal for making bows or arrows), and even uses like dyes, glues, and basketry.
what – so it provides certain answers in the form of nourishment – literally; “bringing (you) up, raising, fostering, supporting, preserving”.
it is so great to get them locally and for the amazing prices that can only be had on such a visit!
the photos are very clear and the descriptions have been written by someone who has actually used the plants to the ends described therein (believe me, this is not the norm).
this is afree interview – call in to listen live at 10 a.m. est (9 a.m. cst & 8 a.m. pst).

timelapse the situation and it’s like we appeared only yesterday – instantaneously – in ever-changing form, on a particular planet.
thousands of chinese herbs have entered the western pharmacopoeia; the earliest and best known is perhaps ginseng.
because we will be teaching actual skills on the land, we must limit the class size in order to ensure that each student experiences an attentive learning environment.
p.p.s. i understand the many detrimental effects that alcoholism and alcohol related accidents have had on us as individuals and as a civilization.
i have witnessed dramatic reductions in the symptoms of psoriasis at wilbur hot springs.
native biologists, shamans, and wild food experts will lead us through the most nourishing, exciting and informative eco-adventure of our lives!
but to a plant, death is laughable.

many wild foraged plants are eaten like vegetables (stinging nettle come to mind) but lack the energy density that we get from meats, grains, oils, concentrated sugars.
my close friendfrank giglio will be creating all of our meals throughout the weekend using the freshest local, organic, and wild-crafted ingredients.
business partners jen warr of chocolatree cafe and kelly johnson of sedona superfoods, in combination come together to provide for us at the retreat this fall.
that is all changing for me now that i have learned to forage a few key items, perhaps the greatest and most important, of which is wild rice.
who knows what we have missed simply by not asking a plant what benefit it might have for mankind, rather than saying “tree, chop it and burn it for fire.”
they provide an exotic spiciness to any dish, from sweet to savory, and they come with the added percieved benefit of being from my own personal harvest.
from my perspective it’s a kind of plant artistry.
this is because of a curing process used with commercially prepared “wild rice” that causes the grains to become very hard and locks in some of the unpleasantly strong flavors.
and don’t forget to check out the mead making workshop that i have coming up next week.
from yet another direction, the “higher reflection” in a sense themother of raw, living diets, can be seen in the traditions and disciplines ofplant dietas.
i love drinking it this way throughout the day, and like saving the older, dryer, and “harder” cider for the evenings with dinner and after.
with this in mind, i set forth exploring a raw food diet – with sharp eyes and a healthy aversion to dogma and definitions.

my experience has been that you can only truly feel the chronic congestion after you have cleared it.
i will be talking about everything from the “best foods available in the super-market” to the “ worst food that people are eating today“.
you can imagine that prior to the widespread use of refrigeration, areas of the world with large apple yields would have had quite a bit of cider on hand, as the juice of fresh apples ferments quite readily.
the film exposes the myths and mistruths that the diet-fad and processed food industries have perpetrated on a mis-educated populace for so many years.

hour after hour i burned to know and meet the species who’s berry drupes splatter painted pink the otherwise indistinguishable wall of sub-tropic greenery that lined the  highway 75.
due to its status as florida’s floral-enemy-number-one, we can harvest its berries with a kind of impunity that is rarely experienced by the modern forager.
we have chosen the intimate class size to ensure that each of you gets the close personal attention you need, and to ensure that we don’t trample our wild foraging grounds.
many of us, in fact, might even have a moral repulsion to the idea.
it reduces scaling, itching and inflammation.
however, we also till the ground when we excavate the roots, disturbing the soil and maintaining an open area–which is absolutely necessary for this species.
if this wasn’t enough, phyto-chemicals in nettle root further work to prevent benign prostate hyperplasia (bph) by stopping the binding of dht to the prostate membrane.
wolfe several years ago, during dieta with ayahuasca, the plants suggested to me that “ayahuasca would go best with raw food”.
the first wild food of the season!
essentially, plants can do whatever they want with humans, and with near-absolute impunity.
the last two weekend events we hosted in maine turned out to be game-changers for nearly everyone involved.

- remove scale and smooth the skin, which is particularly true of topical treatments that you apply to your skin.
there are of course wonderful uses for chaga with its bark on as well, particularly as an anti-neoplastic medicine.
