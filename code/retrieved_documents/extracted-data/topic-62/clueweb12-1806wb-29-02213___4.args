all of my orchids (phals, mini-cymbidiums, & occs) are in an east-facing window over my kitchen sink.
those made for potpouri or votive candles work great for small orchids (i managed to find several dirt cheap at a thrift shop).
a window facing a partial sun might do.
and as also stated, terracotta orchid pots with the little slits in the sides are best for good drainage & aeration.
they're put out by a fl company called kerry's.
i lost all my big orchid plants recently and am down to one phaelenopsis which has yet to bloom, but looks nice and healthy.
soil kept just moist works best; overwatering will yellow & rot them.

a friend stopped by today and told me she has orchids like mine and waters them by putting three ice cubes on the soil once a week.

a good watering and it was perky within a couple of hours.
used as directed, & clipping off the bloom stems once they wither, can have your orchid blooming almost continuously.
they're lovely easy plants - a perfect beginner's orchid.
i'd find it wilted and draped over the pot, down to the floor.
special orchid clay pots have holes and slits all around the pot.
but if i were you, i'd consider that these orchids are true tropicals, & ice-cold melting water isn't really optimum.
do not over-fertilize this orchid.

however, my screened porch is east-facing and shaded so maybe i'll put them out there for the summer and figure out what to do with them in the fall.
like bg, a north window and moderately moist soil works for peace lilies and orchids--i have one large and 2 small phals that are plump-leaved and producing new roots and leaves, plus a variegated peace lily putting out new leaves.

hide post claude, i'll look for one of those orchid pots.
1/4 strength will do ok, in the growing season
this way you can water your plant, anytime of the day/night.

the best thing i've found so far for the pitiful ones rescued off the sales rack are decorative pots with lots of holes.
although i don't know how "organic" it is, i also use a fertilizer specifically meant for orchids.

orchid plants roots need to breathe.

wipe excess water, with a paper folded paper towel.

if that pot it is in has a plastic pot inside i would take off the outer pot.
as stated on other posts - well-draining orchid medium is best, which usually consists mostly of shredded bark.

plain old luke-warm water is still the best.

from a google search for peace lily, i gather that they pretty much thrive on neglect?
1/4 strength will do ok, in the growing season use porous orchid mix; then you can water/fertilize with about 80 degree warm water, any time of the day, during the growing season.

so if it's indoors, water and/or mist it frequently.

these plants were given as memorials to my sister so i'm hoping to be able to keep them around.
so it can get fully doused and enjoy the steam and humidity.

hide post north-facing exposures do not work for me, nor did i say they did.
depending on the orchid type, high humidity isn't always necessary, & more orchids die from overwatering than underwatering - particularly those with aerial root systems grown in a bark medium.

but if i were you, i'd consider that these orchids are true tropicals, & ice-cold melting water isn't really optimum.
keep a pot of "catnip" nearby to deter your cats.
if that pot it is in has a plastic pot inside i would take off the outer pot.
