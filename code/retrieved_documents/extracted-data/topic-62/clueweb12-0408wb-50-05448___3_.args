this in turn means that fertilizer applied to the soil will leach out rapidly, so more frequent fertilizing is necessary for best performance.growing roses in containers offers some real advantages if you are running short of garden space, or if you find that working at ground level has become too challenging, or if you simply want to experiment with an easily changed garden design featuring new roses.treatment for pests or diseases is generally easier, since the rose can be isolated from the rest of the landscape for the required tlc.recent developments in the horticultural therapy field have shown how gardeners who find it physically difficult to work at ground level can continue to pursue their hobby with containerized plants, since they can be located at a tabletop height.many types of roses have been found to respond well when planted in a pot.because it is essential to provide fast drainage the soil can dry out very quickly, so that daily watering is necessary in hot weather; in fact smaller pots may need to be watered twice daily during very hot spells.this approach involves more work but offers the best chance of developing healthy roots and top growth.rose standard, clay pot sits on table another important reason for growing roses in pots, which is becoming more popular each year, is to make it easier for the gardener/designer to assess the suitability of a new rose in the landscape.this also ensures that the pot will hold enough soil to avoid drying out too fast.lack of space is still a strong motivation, of course, but now the types of roses that are grown in pots for the long term include larger floribundas, hybrid teas and grandifloras, and even some of the modern shrub roses.pots made of terra cotta, glazed ceramic, plastic, wood or even (for short-term use) biodegradable fiber are the containers most often used, with the ubiquitous black plastic nursery pots leading the way.cultural changes, compared with conventional "in ground" gardening, are minor and easily accomplished.to help root development superphosphate should be added to the mix (about Â¼ cup for large pots, 1 tablespoon for smaller pots) and many rosarians also add a slow-release fertilizer.the compatibility of its color, size, form and all-round quality with the existing plantings can be tried out by placing the containerized rose in its proposed location for a year or longer before installing it in the ground.most kinds of containers (which can include pots, tubs, troughs, hanging baskets, etc.) work well for roses, though most experienced gardeners have their favorites.
