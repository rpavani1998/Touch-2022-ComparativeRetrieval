we have learned with rocket stove experiments that floating a small amount of cooking oil on the surface of the food increases the efficiency of the stove significantly by preventing evaporation (which accounts for significant heat loss).cast iron works but its weight can delay cooking or inhibit it completely during marginal conditions.2) plant material infected with insects, nematodes, or viruses can be cooked and dried in a solar oven and made safe to return to the garden or compost heap.- we have learned with rocket stove experiments that floating a small amount of cooking oil on the surface of the food increases the efficiency of the stove significantly by preventing evaporation (which accounts for significant heat loss).while there are a few things that can be overcooked in a solar cooker (vegetables such as tender greens, broccoli, and asparagus, or soft fruits, for example), most foods will only get more tender and flavorful.the ratio of food + pot to the surface area of the reflectors can affect cooking time as well, and in an enclosed box oven you need room for the hot air to circulate and the uvs to bounce around.by making small adjustments in time or the amount of water, your favorite foods taste as good or better than ever.the single biggest reason for failure in solar cooking is not putting in the food early enough in the day.pruning instruments can be sanitized either with dry heat or oiled and steamed.the husk will hold the moisture in and protect the kernels naturally.splitting a big batch of something into two pots (either in your box oven or using two panel or funnel cookers) will get it done more quickly, too.equal pots of stew (veggies and meat cut large) and soup (veggies and meat cut smaller) might get hot at about the same rate, but the stew will take a longer time of simmering for the vegetable and meat to tenderize.if food is done but it's not time to eat yet, you can keep the food warm by heat retention means or you can cool it and reheat it briefly (which is still way less fuel or power use than actually cooking the food) on your stove.until you become confident with judging the sun and your cooker, vegetarian foods are safest.this process also strengthens a cardboard cooker to a significant degree.
