large nurseries, particularly those that specialize in camellias, may be able to provide interested gardeners with tea plants ready for home growing.if you also drink coffee and caffeinated soft drinks or take medication containing caffeine, eliminating these from your diet will make it easier for you to drink tea without fear of troublesome habituation.at best, it can be one part of a healthy lifestyle that includes the following: not smoking or using tobacco in other forms; minimizing exposure to radiation, carcinogenic chemicals, and direct sunlight; eating a varied diet based mostly on grains, beans, and plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables; getting regular aerobic exercise; practicing self-examination for lumps or unusual areas on the skin; and getting regular medical checkups.this practice increases the likelihood of cancer of the mouth and throat.for instance, rose hips contain vitamin c; chamomile helps many people relax; and peppermint has a noticeable soothing effect on the stomach.caffeine is also an addictive drug if taken regularly.but ctc has an important and legitimate role in the tea industry: since it is a mechanized process, it allows for the rapid processing of a high volume of leaves which otherwise would go to waste.water out of the hot tap generally has health-threatening levels of heavy metals (such as lead), as well as an off taste.cancer protection recent epidemiological studies suggest a lower tendency toward cancer in tea-drinking populations.chamomile, for example, can cause allergic reactions in people who are allergic to ragweed.other side effects of withdrawal, usually found in frequent and heavy users of caffeine, are lethargy, irritability, and constipation.the other is that it contains chemicals called psoralens, which can induce sensitivity to sunlight in susceptible individuals.advantages: the leaves have maximum freedom to uncurl and circulate in the water, which makes for stronger and more flavorful tea.rolling helps mix together a variety of chemicals found naturally within the leaves, enhancing oxidation.protection against dehydration a perhaps unexpected benefit of tea drinking is the resulting increase in water consumption, which protects against dehydration.
