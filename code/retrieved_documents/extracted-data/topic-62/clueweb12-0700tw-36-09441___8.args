i know i share circumstances with many of you: without some pots on a patio, balcony, or windowsill, we would be plant-less.
choose a potting soil that has no added fertilizer or nutrients.
materials plastic pots are the least expensive container option, so they’re great for anyone on a budget.
lettuces, for example: these are wonderful to grow at home.
so, for this installment of city dirt, we’re covering container basics for the urbanite looking to supply their kitchen with some garden goodness.
if you choose clay pots, be sure to purchase a saucer or plate to sit under the pot.
• make the most of what you grow by considering its uses beyond the kitchen.
(he declined and now has a vegetable bed in the worst place, which i secretly love.)
if you are adding new plants to previously used containers, do not rely on simply digging a small hole in the soil and stuffing in a plant start.
i suggest growing plants that will be used frequently, but in small amounts.
[i don't currently have the capacity for true composting].
it is better to leave a little wiggle room than to have plant roots mashing up against the container walls.
these roots will impede the new plant’s roots and constrict air as the new plant tries to grow into the same small space.

anyway, your post was great and has definitely inspired me to explore more options when i move this summer to as place that *hopefully* has a teeeny bit more space to expand to more pots and more than just herbs
this gives plants time to regrow between cuttings — no sense in planting a crop that you’ll wipe out in one go.
old soils often contain dead roots from previous plants (see above).
this works in two ways — to keep moisture off the surface of your deck or patio and to hold in moisture for the plant.
i had a balcony garden last year with promise, but i unfortunately neglected it over time (plus partial sun wasn't treating some of the plants well).
you should know from the onset that not all vegetables grow well in containers.
(of course, all of the failures may be due as much to my poor gardening technique as anything else).
the bell peppers did ok (although the fruit stayed fairly small) and the tomatoes did rather poorly.
i use lettuce in large amounts, and their fast growing cycle makes them highly productive, economical, and worthwhile.
as on the farm, till your soil using a fork or your hands.
(my basil only made it to november, but i'm excited to get it going again).
i won't be discussing it here, but making your own pots is super rewarding, too!

i’m relegated to planting any food i want in pots.

it's honestly not my preference, but still, i like to think that i’ve perfected the art of growing in my microclimate.
quickly, and offer fresh greens for salads, or for a nice leafy garnish.
if you allow for some growth, you increase the odds of your plant growing to full maturity.
when i'm not knee deep in dirt growing food, you can find me in the kitchen where i'm likely standing over a canning pot or staring up in to my pantry deciding what to make.
thanks so much and i'm excited for it to get warmer to start planting!
in my own garden, i fill eight old water bottles and carry them back and forth from my kitchen sink.
for that reason, just as you would in a garden bed, it’s best to rework your soil before planting.
loosen it up, remove the root hairs, then gently work in some compost and a spoonful of a low-level organic fertilizer before adding a new plant start.
it’s true that they are usually the least attractive option, but they hold their moisture longer than clay or ceramic pots and are lighter and easier to move around.
choose plants that will run through their life cycle in one season (annuals) as well as plants that continue to come back year after year in the same pot (perennials).
arugula and mache are just popping up, too, having reseeded themselves from last year (at the end of the season i stopped harvesting their leaves and let them "go to seed" — the matured plant grows seed pods that fall into the soil and regrow).
this is helpful in that it allows roots to breathe and keeps them out of direct water,

this works in two ways — to keep moisture off the surface of your deck or patio and to hold in moisture for the plant.
by planting in a contained environment, you are inhibiting the plant’s growth to some extent.

soil you must use potting soil in your containers — soil mixes are formulated to maintain a certain level of lightness so that plants are able to breathe, drain well, and still hold in some moisture.
