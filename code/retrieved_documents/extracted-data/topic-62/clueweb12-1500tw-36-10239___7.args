hi, i love to use old styrafoam ice chests ( just the cheap ones) to plant in.

wood, unglazed ceramic (like terracotta), or papier mache pots are all porous and lose moisture more quickly.
make sure your soil is like a damp sponge.
smaller containers – about 4-6 inches deep – can be used to grow vegetables like lettuce, spinach, and herbs.
in 1910, the almanac's publishers began pre-drilling holes in the corners to make it even easier for readers to keep all of that invaluable information (and paper) handy.
be careful that plants in porous containers, like ceramic pots, don’t dry out too much, though.
styrofoam peanuts added to the bottom of the container make good drainage material.
starting with the first edition of the farmers' almanac in 1818, readers used to nail holes into the corners to hang it up in their homes, barns, and outhouses (to provide both reading material and toilet paper).

for vegetables like swiss chard, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower, one to two gallon containers work better.
after you’ve chosen containers appropriate to the vegetables you plan to grow, and placed your containers in the warmest sunniest spot you can find, you will need to choose a suitable growing medium.
