like bg, a north window and moderately moist soil works for peace lilies and orchids--i have one large and 2 small phals that are plump-leaved and producing new roots and leaves, plus a variegated peace lily putting out new leaves.
they're lovely easy plants - a perfect beginner's orchid.

if that pot it is in has a  plastic pot inside i would take off the outer pot.
the only  pest i've ever had a problem with is mealybug, which seems to arrive on every  orchid i've purchased or received.

as in low light, and watering only when wilty?
wipe excess water, with a paper folded paper towel.
and as also stated, terracotta  orchid pots with the little slits in the sides are best for good drainage &  aeration.

i have no idea what sort of orchid this one is.
depending on the orchid type, high humidity isn't always necessary, & more orchids die from overwatering than underwatering - particularly those with aerial root systems grown in a bark medium.
those made for potpouri or votive candles work great for small orchids (i managed to find several dirt cheap at a thrift shop).

do not over-fertilize this  orchid.

they're put out by a fl  company called kerry's.
the best thing i've found so far for the pitiful ones rescued off the sales  rack are decorative pots with lots of holes.

from a google search for peace lily, i gather that they pretty much thrive on neglect?

as in low light, and watering  only when wilty?
but if i were you, i'd consider that these  orchids are true tropicals, & ice-cold melting water isn't really optimum.
although i don't know how "organic" it is, i also use a fertilizer specifically meant for orchids.
plain old luke-warm water is still the best.

hide post your orchid is a phaelanopsis(sp?) - aka "moth orchid".
any advice is welcome!
1/4 strength will do ok, in the growing season use porous orchid mix; then you can water/fertilize with about 80 degree warm water, any time of the day, during the growing season.
