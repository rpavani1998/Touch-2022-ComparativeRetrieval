kitchens and bathrooms are key sources of indoor moisture and other pollutants.most homeowners find single-handle faucets more convenient, and experts consider them safer for kids than separate hot and cold levers, which are more likely to cause a scalding injury.these devices do not regulate temperature or pressure, but do offer protection against serious burns.in general, they provide excellent resistance against stains, scratches, chips, and fading.bathroom ventilation should be powerful enough to remove excess moisture before it has time to condense on cold walls and windows, potentially damaging finishes, or escape into wall or ceiling cavities, where it may lead to decay or peeling paint.with proper installation and care, any of these materials can provide a durable, attractive floor in a kitchen.in addition to providing a visual focal point, durable and easy-to-clean counters are critical for both hygiene and efficiency.the young and elderly are at greatest risk due to thinner skin and slower reaction times.epoxy tile grouts resist stains for a higher degree of stain-resistance as well as moderate resistance to some chemicals, epoxy grout is a good option for applications such as showers, bathroom floors, or heavily used kitchen counters.for a higher degree of stain-resistance as well as moderate resistance to some chemicals, epoxy grout is a good option for applications such as showers, bathroom floors, or heavily used kitchen counters.bathroom ventilation design recommendations bathroom ventilation should be powerful enough to remove excess moisture before it has time to condense on cold walls and windows, potentially damaging finishes, or escape into wall or ceiling cavities, where it may lead to decay or peeling paint.both stainless steel and vitreous china are extremely durable, easy to clean, and impervious to rust, stains, and heat.these polymer additives make the grout more water-resistant, flexible, and stain resistant, and, with colored grouts, better able to maintain a consistent color.cleanup of dried material requires special solvents, and the silica sand presents a respiratory hazard.the most common choices are discussed below: because of its durability and economy, stainless steel accounts for over 60% of kitchen sinks in both new homes and remodels.
