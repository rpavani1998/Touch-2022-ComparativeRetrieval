plastic pots are inexpensive and are slow to dry out, which is an advantage with most plants, but a disadvantage for plants that need “good drainage” — like lavender or these sedums.if potted plants are tropical they can usually be brought indoors to winter over as houseplants, assuming you cut way back on the watering and give them the right type and amount of sun.terra cotta pots look better, but are a lot heavier, and most won’t withstand the freeze-and-thaw cycles of winter.it’s practically gardening tradition to cover drainage holes with broken terra cotta chards or an inch of gravel, but respected horticultural authoritylinda chalker-scott says studies have shown that the practice actually impedes drainage - because water does not travel well from the potting mix to the coarse gravel mixture.they clearly provide better drainage than plastic, though.it’s best to use an organic fertilizer that’s diluted in water, like fish emulsion and liquid seaweed.the container types are detailed below but there’s one thing they all have in common: the bigger, the better for the health of the plants.hanging plants require aspecial commitment on the part of their caretaker.and containers are portable, so we can move plants around the garden or even indoors for the winter, especially with the help of plant dollies.types are detailed below but there’s one thing they all have in common: the bigger, the better for the health of the plants.those soil-less mixtures have the advantage of being lightweight, well-draining and disease-free, but do need all their nutrients provided by you, don’t forget.she uses half compost and half sandy soil for her pots, with a sterile potting medium only for the top two inches and mulch on top of that to prevent weeds.in any event, don’t use regular garden soil — it’s heavy, not as freely draining (which is of supreme importance in containers) and it may come with pests.you can accomplish these arrangements in one large, stand-alone container or by using several containers of different sorts with a variety of plants.containers are also great when our soil is horrible for planting.
