they’ve found that arsenic exposure not only disrupts the immune system but also disrupts the endocrine system, causing unusually broad hormonal upheavals.according to scientists at the marine biological laboratory (mbl) in woods hole, massachusetts, and dartmouth medical school, the ability to mount an immune response to h1ni infection, a form of influenza a, can be significantly compromised by even low levels ofarsenic exposure that commonly occur through drinking contaminated wellwater.based on these results, the scientists strongly suggested that treatment with astaxanthin may be effective for oxidative stress-associated neurodegeneration.reactors concentrate energy to an extreme degree, which is why there have been fatal reactor accidents in the real world of fallible, error-prone people.recent research has documented its ability to increase cellular energy, protect against and treat cancer, protect against damage to the brain andnervous system, and halt the progression of complications from diabetes.with ample resources available, engineers would make space colonies safe from collisions and radiation, and without earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, tornadoes, or hurricanes they’d be safer than earth.it improves fine lines and wrinkles, skin elasticity and moisture content while reducing inflammation and cell damage that leads to premature aging.aflatoxins are deadly products of mold that can cause liver damage and cancer.oxidative stress leading to mitochondrial dysfunction is a critical factor for many diseases, such as cancer, neurodegenerative and lifestyle-related diseases.cholesterol is actually saving the lives of people, because cholesterol is a bandage, a waterproof bandage that the body has designed.fruits, vegetables, grains, poultry and fish would be delivered automatically on demand, and toilet sewage would be processed as fertilizer to close the cycle.low dose arsenic compromises the immune response to influenza infection in vivo.this allows bacteria and allergens to exit the body instead of spreading and causing infections in other areas.building more energy efficient systems, especially transportation systems, is a way we can reduce energy needs.astaxanthin has also shown in research to be effective against chronic viral and autoimmune diseases.
