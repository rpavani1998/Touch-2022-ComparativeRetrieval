a good growing medium will hold water and provide adequate nutrients and physical support to grow healthy plants.container gardening is an easy, enjoyable way to grow your own vegetables, and can be done on a windowsill, patio, balcony, doorstep, or any space that will provide sufficient sunlight and ease of care.when making the decision to container garden, you will want to think about many of the same things you’d be thinking about if you were gardening on a piece of land, such as healthy soil, adequate sunlight, enough water, good fertilizer, and thoughtful pest management.the beauty is , they are light, hold water, and keep the plants’ roots cool.you can still raise fresh, nutritious, homegrown vegetables just about anywhere, as long as you can find yourself some sturdy, simple containers.you can plant in either porous or nonporous containers, but you will need to adjust how much, and how frequently, you water your plants, and pay special attention to drainage.plastic, glazed ceramic, and dark glass containers are nonporous and hold water better.wood, unglazed ceramic (like terracotta), or papier mache pots are all porous and lose moisture more quickly.once you’ve got your containers filled with healthy soil, you can either direct seed or transplant healthy, strong, seedlings into your containers.for vegetables like swiss chard, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower, one to two gallon containers work better.smaller containers – about 4-6 inches deep – can be used to grow vegetables like lettuce, spinach, and herbs.other vegetables that can do well in containers if the conditions are right are cabbage, kale, broccoli and cauliflower.after you’ve chosen containers appropriate to the vegetables you plan to grow, and placed your containers in the warmest sunniest spot you can find, you will need to choose a suitable growing medium.styrofoam peanuts added to the bottom of the container make good drainage material.to aid in good drainage flow, make sure any container you use has several drain holes along the bottom edge.
