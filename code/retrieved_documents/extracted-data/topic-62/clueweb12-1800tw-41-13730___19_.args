plastic medicine spoons also are guilty of being too curvaceous.other restaurants will use untreated aluminium, it has superior heat qualities (although cast iron has better heat retention properties), but isn’t advised by the fsa as it can react with foods and cause a build-up of aluminium in the body (a bad thing).copper, when used in cooking pots is invariably tinned for the same reasons- copper pots are rare these days as there are better alternatives.22 april 2012 2:11pmresponse to ambikadevi, 21 april 2012 7:12pm copper, in small amounts, has an anti-bacterial action, it also has excellent heat transfer qualities, so it would be great for holding water (as we know, as we use copper water pipes).it would have to be organized as a blind taste test to determine if the material the cutlery is made of has anything effect on taste.stainless steel is non-reactive (but harder to sharpen) while carbon steel is reactive, even slicing a tomato can cause a reaction (it’s easier to keep sharp but holds a blade for a shorter time, hence a straightening steel).also if you cook with cast iron (not enamelled) pans like a dutch oven then the food will, variables aside, supply enough trace iron to supply your daily requirements.apart from being the best made, most expensive socks i own, they also do work- in that they stop foot rot and stinky feet, you can wear them for days, which is important if you are going on a hike for a few days or more.plastic spoons always taste greasy, and are only good for babies.your tongue and nose do the tasting, if i smell a silver (plated) spoon i am highly unlikely to notice a difference between that and a stainless steel spoon and as i have explained, eating curry isn’t going to have any effect regardless of what metal you use, somebody’s aftershave would have more effect.with a decent selection of acidic foods linked in series you could probably get a decent voltage up.as a child i remember the metal cups at school too, but it was the camping trips, all the food and drink had that strong plastic taste from the plates, cups and cutlery 20 april 2012 1:43pm stainless steel isn't the best metal for cutlery, perhaps metal isn't the best material for cutlery at all – though on current evidence i reckon it is.infact, some ayurvedic medicines are made with fine gold dust and herbs....as for the taste of food....almost all food preparation will involve a knife, there are two main materials, carbon steel and stainless steel.a shallow bowl should render the food easier to slide off with the lips.
