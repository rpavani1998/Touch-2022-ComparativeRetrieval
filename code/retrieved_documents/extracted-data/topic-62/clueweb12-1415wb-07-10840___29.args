for this reason i will continue to promote sovereign self-health care strategies here at danielvitalis.com.
i am so enthusiastic about this upcoming foraging and touring season.
this workshop will be fully catered with organic, local food, prepared by chef frank giglio, who is one of my best friends and a truly culinary mentor of mine.
when we eat and drink – we practice relationship with different forces, with spirits and sentience.
it is easy to lose sight of the obvious; that we are all friends and workingtogether toward a common goal.
though each of us is very different, there is a common theme that we all agree on, and that is wanting to see a healthier, more peaceful, and more beautiful world for everyone.
the initial fermentation stage is wonderful, as the cider develops its sparkling effervescence.
if you are thinking of coming, secure your space soon because this workshop will fill!
through the alchemy of the fermentative process something new will be created, and that new thing is known as the “synbiotic”.
~daniel ps, check out this podcast i recently did where we discuss the history of grains and agriculture, as well as some must have information on making the grains you use a safe and healthy food!
in fact, for much of the year i use it almost daily and have for several years now… chaga is normally decocted (boiled in water to produce a broth or tea) for about two hours, yielding a very mild vanilla like flavor (it containsvanillin as one of its components) which is great to drink on its own, with added cream and a sweetener (i like maple syrup) to create a drink much like coffee.
we are friends first and foremost, and we know the value of love and laughter.
either the pictures weren’t clear, the text wasn’t informative enough, the author was lacking real experience, or the book just wasn’t laid out in a user friendly way (ok, samuel thayer’s books are an exception to these criticisms, and are excellent wild food references).
what follows is a spoof of myself, david wolfe, and matt monarch all hanging out in my kitchen making the “longevity now conference 16 dvd set superfood tonic elixir smoothie”… i play all of the parts, and keep in mind that this was made on an extreme time budget.
invite the forces of nature, say an orange or a mushroom, and with the right kind of eyes – grow further infused with infinite ecologies of everlasting spirits.
i will be talking aboutrewilding and transcending human domestication, and how we can stay strong, healthy, and actively-fit for a lifetime in a world that constantly pushing us towards a deeper state of domestication.
my close friendfrank giglio will be creating all of our meals throughout the weekend using the freshest local, organic, and wild-crafted ingredients.
if you are looking for a premier chaga extract you can find it at my company,surthrival.
synbiotics like sauerkraut have long been used by those before us to fortify their immune systems, assist in digestion (their acidity helps to lower the ph of the stomach increasing the effectiveness of our hydrochloric acid), and to maintain healthy levels of the probiotic organisms that colonize our digestive lumen.
if you are thinking of coming, secure your space soon because this workshop will fill!
for years i used this fungus without peeling it, which yeilded wonderful results, but now that i have included the traditional preperation method, it would be difficult to depart from.
more than this, it also prevents the conversion of testosterone into a metabolite known as dihydrotestosterone, which has been implicated in benign prostate hyperplasia and even male pattern baldness.
not only is this book the most useful and user friendly i have seen on the subject, but by purchasing it you are directly supporting the preservation of remaining wild places in a radical new way, by educating people how to care for and interface with wild nature.
this video post is about peeling chaga, which is its traditional preparation method in siberia (it is from their folk medicine that we have learned of chaga).
before trying truly wild rice, i was familiar only with the store bought, paddy cultivated wild rice which, though wonderful in flavor and rich in nutrition, just simply pales in comparison.
fermentation can seem a bit intimidating when you haven’t tried it before, and that is why i am posting this video.
this video details how you can make your own, and at a very low price at that.
oil in the seas, nuclear fallout spreading across the globe, shortages of food, genetic and degenerative disease, antibiotic resistant infectious agents, mass extinctions, epidemic infertility, genetic modification, electro-smog, etc, ad infinitum.
plant-based edible living sculpture with vibrant living beings who in return sculpt you.
so it’s really up to us to take an interest if we are to make the friendship of those spirits.
this is going to be a very special weekend, featuring talks by botharthur haines and myself, as well as introductions to several earth based surthrival skills.
the whole surthrival team with be present for the weekend, posted up at the booth, ready to share and connect with all of the participants!
the fresh maple sap is so refreshing, so hydrating, and tastes so good that it is almost shocking that more people aren’t taking advantage of this delicious, abundant, and free late winter/early spring drink!
also, special thanks to my friends at evolver for inviting me to be a part of thevisionary nutrition project, beginning on april 8th with my interview, where i will be teaching about the role of psychoactive plants in the human ecological and dietary niche.
if you’d like to register for general admission, which includes viewing the workshop and hearing my talk, then register here.
check out the video below to hear more about ancestral ignition , and to see acclaimed botanist, author, and my foraging and aboriginal skills guide and all around friend, arthur haines, make a fire with a primitive tool known as the bow drill.
because we will be teaching actual skills on the land, we must limit the class size in order to ensure that each student experiences an attentive learning environment.
if you are looking for a riveting adventure, are interested in peruvian shamanism, amazonian biology, visiting machu pichu, or just wanting to soak in a rain forest hotspring, this trip might be for you.
the world and its spirits don’t really care if we do, for the most part.
hand harvested, sundried, fire parched, foot treaded, and wind winnowed wild rice is so soft and delicate in flavor that it simply has to be tasted to be understood.
i feel very good about sharing these with you because i know how much quality information they contain, and how diverse that information is.
i am expecting this to be a very intimate event, with lots of time for personal exchanges, questions and answers, and exploration of territory that isn’t always easy to cover in a one night talk.
growing in size, staring at our hands, finding our feet, rubbing our eyeballs, mind boggled – immersed, surrounded, and face to face with an overwhelming presence perceived, at times, as threatening.
this e-book is very comprehensive, and empowers us to take our dental health into our own hands for a lifetime.
in contrast to many wild foraged plants, wild rice requires a more considerable amount of know how and equipment to locate, access, harvest, and process, so to show this in its entirety is simply outside the scope of a blog post.
the surthriver believes in and aligns themselves with life.
the class has been filling up rather quickly these last few weeks, and we are getting very excited for the spring foraging to begin!
we strive to put on events that can nourish the body, inform the mind, and touch the spirit.
the entire book is extensively footnoted so that you can access the scientific literature from which so much of this information has been compiled.
significantly, it’s acleanse – of body, of mind – and by extension, environment.
trees will be here long after we’re gone, and so will stones and bricks and clouds and the moon.
making your own nettle root tinctures at home can be easy, and only takes few minutes.
i am grateful to the abundant earth.
of course the beverages fermented by native peoples and by our traditional cultural forebearers were much healthier and nutritionally viable than those of today, created with local ingredients and wild yeasts, and were not filtered and pasturized like the ones that most of us were raised around.
stinging nettle (urtica dioica) is an herbaceous perennial flowering plant known by many of us for the painful stinging hairs (they are actually called “trichomes”) that inject histamine into our skin like micro hypodermic needles.
it is 3 days long, catered by chef frank giglio with all local organic and wild food, and taught by myself and wild food expertarthur haines.
this is afree interview – call in to  listen live at 10 a.m. est (9 a.m. cst & 8 a.m. pst).
so i can honestly tell you they are the best around.
~d p.s. though saline water is what people usually put in their neti pots, i have heard of many other solutions.
best of all, you can swallow this toothpaste, which yields all of the amazing health benefits of these detoxifying earth compounds.
this health seminar unlike any other.
many of us have taken our diets and nutrition into our own hands, though when it comes to personal health care, few of us have really stepped out and away from the entrenched medical system’s doctor/dentist treatment, and the role we play in it as “patient” (from the latin meaning “suffering”).
this is particularly perplexing since the pollen of pine trees has been used for millennia in china and korea as both food and a particularly powerful tonic and adaptogen, especially for the elderly.
there are those online whodo take this far too seriously and are constantly leveling accusations, and cruel and harsh words against us.
you can imagine that prior to the widespread use of refrigeration, areas of the world with large apple yields would have had quite a bit of cider on hand, as the juice of fresh apples ferments quite readily.
for the last several years i have talked more about chaga (inonotus obliquus) than any other wild foraged food or medicine.
i have used this strategy, along side others, such as regular sauna use (check out clearlight saunas, it is the brand of infrared sauna that i have in my home), a clean whole food diet containing lots of wild foods and herbs,drinking natural spring water, implimenting regular functional exercise, all combined with and tied together with time spent in nature.
not only is this book the most useful and user friendly i have seen on the subject, but by purchasing it you are directly supporting the preservation of remaining wild places in a radical new way, by educating people how to care for and interface with wild nature.
they can throw you down, clean you up, send you out to space, thrust you on a new paths, make you change your ways, whisper advice, keep you warm, dry, sheltered, alive, and in some cases, even kill you.
it has been working very well for me, and it just might work for you too.
you will gain tremendous knowledge and be supporting a wonderful and important cause.
an open source invitation into deeper relation with the many things that fuel, heal, and energize us; that which is alive all around us, co-createswith us.
i have just finished preparing my presentation, called “habitat, your guide to intentional lifestyle design” which will focus on specific strategies for more than just vigorous health, but epi-genetic wealth.
you can check out lots of my past interviews with him (as well as hundreds of other amazing guests) in hisextensive audio archives .
it is easy to lose sight of the obvious; that we are all friends and workingtogether toward a common goal.
it does not mean we are contending with one another, and certainly doesn’t affect our friendship or support of eachother.
for those of you who are interested in going deeper, i would highly recommend an e-book by my good friend nadine artemis called “successful self-dentistry, how to avoid the dentist without ignoring your teeth”.
and if we can do that–a big task, no doubt–then the way people interact with the world and the spirits of the world and universe will change, automatically, from one of dominance to one of cooperation.

to compliment and expand on my video, i have also included a video with botanist arthur haines detailing how he taps his maples, and prepares his maple syrup.
it can be so easy to find and focus on the differences in what each of us is teaching and if we are not careful, to allow ourselves to be divided by it.
turning simple sugars into ethanol, amino acids, and b complex vitamins, not to mention a culturally and ritually significant inebriant is a nearly ubiquitous human behavior, and part of what holds the fabric of traditional societies together.
they take our work and contort it in an attempt to make a mockery of us.
for this reason i will continue to promote sovereign self-health care strategies here at danielvitalis.com.
nettle root contains compunds that bind to shbg taking the place of testosterone and thereby keeping free testosterone in the blood.
it is the open, clear, and relaxed sense of breathing; the ability to fully utilize your respiration that makes you conscious of its importance.
the experience of procuring food directly from wild nature is truly, for me at least, one of the great joys of living!
and while we use the term “intoxicant” to refer to drinks that contain alcohol, these people didn’t associate their sacred beverages with “toxicity” at all.
while the aerial parts of the plant (the parts that grow above the ground) are most commonly eaten as a pot herb (cooked) or made into infusions (teas), it is the roots from which we can extract its potent androgenic substances.
none the less, it will now be immortalized forever.
while i get to meet so many of you out on the road when i am teaching around the world, this is our chance to spend a full week together, exploring the wonders of this beautiful planet!
we have priced this event very resonably, and i look forward to sharing a message of empowerment, resolve, wisdom, and health with all who attend.
the surthrivalist differs from the survivalist in that they operate from a place of love and recognition of the inherent bounty of the natural world.
this is because of a curing process used with commercially prepared “wild rice” that causes the grains to become very hard and locks in some of the unpleasantly strong flavors.
i love drinking it this way throughout the day, and like saving the older, dryer, and “harder” cider for the evenings with dinner and after.
while many people use probiotic supplements in an attempt to achieve these ends, most often lacto-fermented foods perform these tasks better, can be made at home from whole, fresh, local foods, are inexpensive, and add a considerable amount of quality nutrition in the form of highly absorbable predigested, living food.
david wolfe and hislongevity warehouse exists to support peoples health and developement, and is critical to keeping the message alive and available.
duringplant dietas, one is isolated, eats very little, and/or very simply, in order to remove distractions, sensitize one’s body/mind/spirit to the subtleties of the spirit world, to become transparent, lucid and focused in it.
another aspect that makes this seminar unlike any other, is that each individual participant will be “grounded” (using the latest cutting-edge technology provided to us byearthing) throughout the event in its entirety!
in fact, it seems to me that the only humans who will be able to inhabit this planet soon will be those who have developed and implemented strategies to thrive in this brave new polluted planetary ecology.
now that i am just weeks away from surthrival’s launch of its new pine pollen extracts, i wanted to share a video that is yet one more piece of my natural hormone maintnance strategy.
for those of us who are developing or returning to our ancestral health through traditional and indigenous nutritional practices, few food preparation skills are as valuable to possess as lacto-fermentation.
check out the video interview below to learn more about the book, and click here to get your copy now!
they take our work and contort it in an attempt to make a mockery of us.
the toxic cations are then transported out of our bodies, along with the zeolite powder in our bowel movement.
regardless, taking actions like these has put me at considerable ease about the radio-isotopes in our environment.
rather, and more vital to our personal healing – as well as to the continuation of life as we know it – is our becoming acquainted with the organism producing the food or medicine itself.
as i began experimenting with tissue detoxification using zeolites and clay, it dawned on me that these, when rendered into a fine flour-like powder, have just the right amount of abrasiveness to take the place of the toothpaste i had grown up with.
and if we can do that–a big task, no doubt–then the way people interact with the world and the spirits of the world and universe will change, automatically, from one of dominance to one of cooperation.
it is the strengthened engagement with the harmony of humanity – the beautiful songs we’ve sung and are singing, our peak performance, the best of the best – that boils down to our collective necessities – food, medicine, life – from which can be drawn ever-expanding analogies, inter-elated metaphor, and metamorphosis.
we are less than a month away, so if you would like to join us – by us i mean the very amazing and interesting group of people who have assembled for this trip – contactjeannette at info@rawflora.com, and check out the 11 day 10 night itinerary here.
and when we, mankind, begin interacting with the world, rather than trying to dominate it, well, i think mankind will be better off.
each day we are all breathing the many stow-away particles (read: pollutants) that free float amongst what was once, some pretty fresh air here on planet earth.
you can learn a lot from arugula – even more from cacao, or from an elder like maize.
it can be so easy to find and focus on the differences in what each of us is teaching and if we are not careful, to allow ourselves to be divided by it.
none the less, it will now be immortalized forever.
arthur writes from a place of profound understanding of the nutritional and medicinal actions of wild foods, as well as the important uses that these 95 plants held for the native people of this continent (and still do for the “neo-aboriginal” today).
in the meantime, check out the video below to see the harvest and processing of these beautifully blush bunches of berries!
this video is a message to those people.
in fact, not only does this lifestyle exist, i feel that many apects of  it will be as common to people in the coming decades as taking a shower or brushing your teeth is today.
in the environment we now live in, with its extremes of climate, toxic foods, petro-chemicals, pharmaceuticals, polluted air and water, etc, only those who have developed strong, wise, and strategic methods for thriving will be able to carry forth their genetic material and live through this phase of history to populate the new and coming world.
the experience of procuring food directly from wild nature is truly, for me at least, one of the great joys of living!
if you are looking for a riveting adventure, are interested in peruvian shamanism, amazonian biology, visiting machu pichu, or just wanting to soak in a rain forest hotspring, this trip might be for you.
these particles are constantly lodging in and congesting our upper respiratory tract, creating an environment for infection and/or being drawn still deeper into our lower respiratory tract (our lungs).
my company surthrival recently started carrying what we feel are the most beautiful and durable ceramic neti pots available anywhere, andyou can get one for yourself right here on our newly designed website (we are pretty excited about this)!
not only will you discover the latest advances in longevity technology that aren’t available anywhere else, but this event will be nothing short of one of the most uplifting, educational, and inspirational weekends of your life.
each day is packed with truly exciting adventures, from visits to cacao plantations to white water rafting down a deep jungle river, from a forest canopy eco adventure to visits with the local shaman for healing jungle herbs.
your feedback is crucial to us, and we really do love hearing from you.
the case with clay is very similar, though the phenomena in this case is referred to as adsorption, which is also an electrical binding, but in this case to the surface of the clay particle and without the accompanying exchange of a cation.
their constant quest instead was securing the macronutrient (carbohydrate, lipid, and protein calories) that they required for their huge daily energy expenditures.
the softness is like that of the most perfectly cooked white rice but with all the nutritious nutty flavors of a wild intact grain.
my experience has been that you can only truly feel the chronic congestion after you have cleared it.
if your looking to smog proof your sinuses, help to prevent sinus issues in general, and improve your respiratory health, give the neti pot a try.
from my perspective, it appears that a diet that lacks the geophagy pattern could not be called a “natural diet” at all, as it would essentially be deficient in these all-important compounds.
working safely and respectfully with ayahuasca and other teacher plants, alongside raw food/garden-variety plants, the teacher’s assistants so to speak, leads, of course, to many physical and spiritual benefits.
also, i want to let you know that though this book was written for plants of the north east, dozens of the plants here will  be found throughout north america, and even beyond.
the behavior is termed“geophagy”, and is unquestionably part of the species-specific diet of human beings.
trust me, it will help.
stephen, having studied pine pollen extensively, had much to share on the subject.
ok, a little caveat, we might not actually add the probiotic, but rather let it colonize itself, in what is called a “wild fermentation”, as is the case here with sauerkraut.
while i hadn’t had personal experience with this plant before, i do have plenty of experience with the principles of wild food identification, harvest, and processing, and each of these skills translate well from biome to biome, from one eco-system to the next.
cider is so easy to produce at homea cave man could do it!
though each of us is very different, there is a common theme that we all agree on, and that is wanting to see a healthier, more peaceful, and more beautiful world for everyone.
we will literally cover healthful living from conception to the grave and beyond.
in other words, we can use our environment and lifestyle to activate our genetic potential for a more robust experience of life on earth!
they are so obsessed, and take it allso seriously that they have committed their lives to displaying hatred and spewing vitriol, claiming that their way, their method, their diet, is the only viable truth.
the second will focus on the creation of fire from friction, using natural materials from the landscape, the way it was done for the last 400,000 years.
our lodge sits directly on a private tropical beach, where the noni trees grow abundantly to meet the gentle lick of the caribbean sea.
i eventually engaged and evolved my raw food/living diet path as a kind of inverted version of aplant dieta.
our ability to generate and maintain fire is a powerful thing indeed, so it is our intention to pass on not just the skill, but the ethics of stewardship as well.
in the environment we now live in, with its extremes of climate, toxic foods, petro-chemicals, pharmaceuticals, polluted air and water, etc, only those who have developed strong, wise, and strategic methods for thriving will be able to carry forth their genetic material and live through this phase of history to populate the new and coming world.
the roll of shamanic knowledge for us westerners introduced to those spirits is to spread that knowledge, make communication easier.
the last two weekend events we hosted in maine turned out to be game-changers for nearly everyone involved.
the longevity now conference dvd’s are amazing.
from “organic” store-bought toothpaste brands, to tooth soaps and powders, and even aboriginal “chew sticks” – nothing has been the right fit for my self-dentistry needs.
one of the things i really appreciate about it is that it is written as more than just a wild food guide, it is a plant medicine guide as well,
it says “you can never make fun of us better than we can of ourselves!”, and that living without humor in your life is more than ugly, it is unhealthy and violates one of realities prime directives.
i eventually engaged and evolved my raw food/living diet path as a kind of inverted version of aplant dieta.
that doesn’t mean i don’t appreciated a reprieve, and a chance to charge up my blood with vitamin d from the equatorial sun just before spring begins (ok, the trip actually concludeson the spring equinox)!
the primary fermentative organism present in these kinds of preserves is  lactobacillus acidophilus (who’s name means “acid loving milk bacteria”) one of our bodies primary microbial symbionts.
my company,surthrival, became the first to bring a fully developed pine pollen product line to the natural foods market place in north america.
the neti pot gives us the ability to clean our upper respiratory tract, in much the same way that a toothbrush cleans our mouth or a shower washes our skin, before these particles can accumulate or be drawn deeper.
i have personally been witness to it in my own life amongst people that i love dearly.
the film exposes the myths and mistruths that the diet-fad and processed food industries have perpetrated on a mis-educated populace for so many years.
also, i feel the need to point out the obvious here: people buy products from myself or my colleagues because we carry extremely good products, products that help people.
there are plenty of micronutrients in the foods that i forage from my ecosystem, but most of my actual caloric needs still come from my local farm.
the second will focus on the creation of fire from friction, using natural materials from the landscape, the way it was done for the last 400,000 years.
we are less than a month away, so if you would like to join us – by us i mean the very amazing and interesting group of people who have assembled for this trip – contactjeannette at info@rawflora.com, and check out the 11 day 10 night itinerary here.
spending time witharthur haines has propelled my wild nutrition path forward in ways i am so grateful for.
for me, lacto-ferments like sauerkraut are one of my primary ways of preserving and consuming local vegetables through out the long maine winters.
essentially though, it is process of healing and strengthening.
duringplant dietas, one is isolated, eats very little, and/or very simply, in order to remove distractions, sensitize one’s body/mind/spirit to the subtleties of the spirit world, to become transparent, lucid and focused in it.
the initial fermentation stage is wonderful, as the cider develops its sparkling effervescence.
in fact, not only does this lifestyle exist, i feel that many apects of it will be as common to people in the coming decades as taking a shower or brushing your teeth is today.
daily comm-union, even telepathy, most often one-way, where a plant invited into the human body as food or medicine can “see what you mean”.
nettle root contains compunds that bind to shbg taking the place of testosterone and thereby keeping free testosterone in the blood.
we can each enjoy our meal together over laughter and appreciation for each others company.
the differences between us are beautiful and healthy, and ultimately what make this whole ride so much fun.
watching the season change, feeling the solar low just before we emerge into the spring, seeing the tracks of the animals who move like ghosts through this icy, crystalline landscape, all of this brings out the wonder of a child in me!
you the reader may have encountered some of the harassing internet trolling that each of us has had to endure.
when we eat and drink – we practice relationship with different forces, with spirits and sentience.
for instance, lacto-fermentaion actually increases the amount of nutrition that was present in the vegetable alone (by converting sugars into protein rich bacterial bodies, b vitamins, and omega 3 fatty acids), increase the bio-availability of the existing nutrition (by breaking down cell walls by predigesting the vegetables cellulose, and removing anti-nutrients) and all the while preserving the inherent nutrition better than freezing, canning, or drying!
not only does lactobacillus acidophilus allow us to preserve and even increase the amount of nutrition in our vegetables, but it also aids in digestion and increases our immunity too!
each day we are all breathing the many stow-away particles (read: pollutants) that free float amongst what was once, some pretty fresh air here on planet earth.
as each season goes by and my skills in this area increase, not only have i developed a strong sense of food security, my direct relationship to the earth as an abundant and loving provider continues to increases.
the main focus of this retreat is to share theancient and ancestral skill of aboriginal friction fire with all of those who attend.
i really feel that this movie has the potential to make some real change in the lives of people you know, so please turn your friends and loved ones onto it as well!
this will be a fun call, and patrick is never shy about taking me into edgy and interesting territory!
we add to that the “probiotic” organism (these are healthy, symbiotic micro-organisms) that will be performing the fermentation (here it will be lactobacillus).
the exotic sweet and spicy aromatic flavor of these brittle pink berries was well worth the risk, and i was certain i was on the trail of a new wild food ally.
after years of hosting events and retreats, we have learned what powerful transformational tools these kinds of workshops can be.
that doesn’t mean i don’t appreciated a reprieve, and a chance to charge up my blood with vitamin d from the equatorial sun just before spring begins (ok, the trip actually concludeson the spring equinox)!
while you may not need nettle root as a medicine for yourself, its highly likely you know a man who does.
this e-book is very comprehensive, and empowers us to take our dental health into our own hands for a lifetime.
most of us brush our teeth and we usually expect the same of others.
we can use these advances to ground us while we are spending time indoors, working away by keeping our feet on a ground pad, or wearing one of their grounding bands.
while i have also been fermenting honey with some success (a beverage called mead), i wanted to brew something with a milder effect (mead has the alcohol content of wine, upwards of 16 % or more) that could be done with very little labor or input, just the way our ancestors had done it.
the brazilian pink peppercorn tampa bay was the site of another example of an urban forage, and this time with an exotic invasive that produces more food than i could ever hope to harvest.
in fact, if you know where to look, you could get everything you would need for making all the toothpaste you would use for the rest of your life for probably under $100!
we will have an experienced chef on hand to prepare our meals, and keep us fueled up for our exciting and dramatic daily excursions!
something i could practice daily as a way to learn from, and build relations with numerous “common” plants like kale, chard, chia, blueberries, tomatoes, pears, for example.
my company,surthrival, is my contribution to peoples health and healing and is my way of operating economically in a world that demands this of me.
the survivalist too often operates from a place of fear and uncertainty.
aside from myself speaking, we will be graced with the presence of many other amazing health experts such asdavid wolfe, dr. joseph mercola, frank giglio, donna gates, truth caulkins, nadine artemis, and several others!
and don’t forget to check out the mead making workshop that i have coming up next week.
i will be talking about everything from the “best foods available in the super-market” to the “ worst food that people are eating today“.
given the drive for new plant medicines and the continual search for a new herb-of-the-day that will simulate excitement in the general populace (e.g. rhodiola, maca), it is astonishing that pine has been unrecognized for so long.
i so look forward to sharing my knowledge on this ancient beverage at our workshop coming up in november!
it was a tremendous honor to be a part of the new documentary film “hungry for change”.
the fact that we ordered different dishes does not mean we are in nutritional opposition to one another.
i promise a profound and moving experience in this workshop.
and when we, mankind, begin interacting with the world, rather than trying to dominate it, well, i think mankind will be better off.
all three of us are so focused on creating the life that we desire, each of us so good at what we do, that we have all become characters as archetypical as those found in the pages of a comic book.
there are plenty of micronutrients in the foods that i forage from my ecosystem, but most of my actual caloric needs still come from my local farm.
before trying truly wild rice, i was familiar only with the store bought, paddy cultivated wild rice which, though wonderful in flavor and rich in nutrition, just simply pales in comparison.
null null most of us were taught to spit our toothpaste out, which, given the host of less-than-beneficial ingredients (particularly fluoride) is pretty sound advice.
lacto-fermentation, the kind of vegetable fermentation that produces foods like sauerkraut (as well as kimchee and brined pickles), preserves our food in lactic acid, and was one of the dominant preservation techniques used by our ancestors before sugar and preservatives became the norm.
perhaps it is because they make their money in ways they are not so proud of.
the softness is like that of the most perfectly cooked white rice but with all the nutritious nutty flavors of a wild intact grain.
these wonderful drinks were both relatively low in alcohol, with probably just a bit less than a modern beer, and loaded with nutrition and calories, making them as much a food as a drink.
if you can’t make it to the event, but would like to watch the video stream, here isthe link where you can sign up to watch at home.
it might not be easy, though that doesn’t mean it can’t be exciting – and yes… maybe even fun.
~d p.s. though saline water is what people usually put in their neti pots, i have heard of many other solutions.
“i think that once a person is aware of the life in everything, they can begin to access the spirit of everything.
eating and drinking is intimate communication.
while you may not need nettle root as a medicine for yourself, its highly likely you know a man who does.
more than any other medicinal mushroom, this has been my number one herbal/fungal ally.
my girlfriend ali, my operations manager and brother kaleb, and my best friend and business partner leighlon and i then spent several hours posting this video to everyone we could think of in our social networks.
i really feel that this movie has the potential to make some real change in the lives of people you know, so please turn your friends and loved ones onto it as well!
we can each enjoy our meal together over laughter and appreciation for each others company.
one of the things i really appreciate about it is that it is written as more than just a wild food guide, it is a plant medicine guide as well, detailing herbal uses of these plants in addition to their uses as foods.
they told me that i had until midnight to get something onto youtube, if i was to regain my honor.
in particular i am referring to zeolites ability to perform cation exchange -  cec or cation exchange capacity is the term used in physics- which is its ability to electrically bind positively charged ions (heavy metals, radio-isotopes, etc) whilst trading out (in exchange) beneficial cations like potassium or calcium.
oil in the seas, nuclear fallout spreading across the globe, shortages of food, genetic and degenerative disease, antibiotic resistant infectious agents, mass extinctions, epidemic infertility, genetic modification, electro-smog, etc, ad infinitum.
we are what we eat, and what we eat runs the show.
the drinks served are scrumptious healing blends of herbs and superfoods, to help heal and optimize any individuals condition.
our work is the distillation of years of study and practice, and we could be celebrating the diversity that this has created.
arthur writes from a place of profound understanding of the nutritional and medicinal actions of wild foods, as well as the important uses that these 95 plants held for the native people of this continent (and still do for the “neo-aboriginal” today).
this past autumn was a really exciting time for my team and i, with so many of our projects coming to fruition and our message ofrewilding, spring water, and indigenous nutrition spreading around our community and beyond, faster than we ever imagined.
with childlike enthusiasm, we have been texting back and forth each day to see how much sap the others trees have produced!
i truly believe that the generations alive today are uniquely positioned as the gate keepers of an emerging world.
growing in size, staring at our hands, finding our feet, rubbing our eyeballs, mind boggled – immersed, surrounded, and face to face with an overwhelming presence perceived, at times, as threatening.
given the drive for new plant medicines and the continual search for a new herb-of-the-day that will simulate excitement in the general populace (e.g. rhodiola, maca), it is astonishing that pine has been unrecognized for so long.
while i have also been fermenting honey with some success (a beverage called mead), i wanted to brew something with a milder effect (mead has the alcohol content of wine, upwards of 16 % or more) that could be done with very little labor or input, just the way our ancestors had done it.
this will be a robust and fully developed workshop covering hundreds of aspects of personal health sovereignty, loaded with tips, techniques, and strategies for those of us who are ushering in the new paradigm on earth.
earlier in the year i had the culturally enriching experience of imbibing some of the traditional fermented beverages of south america, specificallychicha (from maize) and masatao (fromcassava), both traditional ferments of the people of peru.
so it provides certain answers in the form of nourishment – literally; “bringing (you) up, raising, fostering, supporting, preserving”.
this video is a quick peek into my spring cleansing strategy which is most welcomed after a lengthy season of living indoors.
on this interview, daniel will be speaking about his latest research into thereclassification of modern humans as a new subspecies.
i get so excited every time it snows here, and though some people find it challenging to live through this kind of cold and dark, i must say that even more than loving it, i am fascinated by it.
the surthrivalist differs from the survivalist in that they operate from a place of love and recognition of the inherent bounty of the natural world.
the few hours that followed are little more than a blur, and if it wasn’t for the record kept in the footage i am about to share with you, i would’t have believed that it even happened.
“what ayahuasca teaches is that right now, at every moment, we already live in the magic forest.”
this is exciting to me, because i am a huge advocate for maximizing the amount of time we spend outdoors, with our barefeet connected to the ground.
until then, please know that your readership is appreciated.
lactobacillus takes up residence in our small intestine, creating a kind of probiotic bio-shield in the gut, where it aggressively out-competes other dys-biotic organisms that can cause us to fall ill.
the second is a documentary called trinity, and it shows with nothing less than truly epic footage, the history of these tests.
and thus far, for most of us throughout mankind’s short history on this planet, that effort has not been made.
as for the technique and specifics, i will let this video explain the rest.
what a wonderful feeling to know that this winter i will be eating more of my calories from foods that were sustainably harvested from my local landscape.
when this clay or zeolite consumption is combined with sauna therapy (this dual approach is the subject ofmy last video), we arrive at a very effective life-long detoxification strategy that really works, and is easy to implement.
those who remain will have to be more than survivors, they will be  surthrivalists.
also, i will be at the longevity now conference in april (1st-3rd), and will be making tickets for the upcoming conference available soon… so… stay tuned, i might just be forced to top this last video!
also, this is an excellent resource for herbalists or those interested in herbal medicine, as each plants pharmacology and mode of action are broken down in a very explicit and comprehensible way.
when this clay or zeolite consumption is combined with sauna therapy (this dual approach is the subject ofmy last video), we arrive at a very effective life-long detoxification strategy that really works, and is easy to implement.
my girlfriend ali, my operations manager and brother kaleb, and my best friend and business partner leighlon and i then spent several hours posting this video to everyone we could think of in our social networks.
with this home-made clay or zeolite toothpaste, the goal is indeed to swallow it, moving it into the intestine where it can go to work mopping up industrial and nuclear debris that has bioaccumulated in our tissues.
more than any other medicinal mushroom, this has been my number one herbal/fungal ally.
storing vegetables for the winter is a critical skill, and lacto-fermentation has some advantages that are hard to beat.
i think the universe has all the secrets of the universe.
they were not viewed as guilt laden pleasures or sources of immoral behavior and debauchery, but rather as sacred and vitally health supportive.
however, the heart of this guidance was clear: ayahuasca, once drank, prefers to live in, and works better with; clean bodies.
i put this up to demonstrate how simple it is to produce your own wild nettle root tincture for use as an herbal medicine.
i think it is an inspired and poignant summation of the plant medicine path, and especially thesynthesis of food, medicine, and the realm of entheogenic plants in the human ecological niche.
the toxic cations are then transported out of our bodies, along with the zeolite powder in our bowel movement.
cider is usually defined as having an alcohol content of 2 – 8.5 % or higher, though my experience is that it tastes great and is incredibly refreshing even during initial fermentation when the alcohol content is negligible like that of kombucha.
thousands of chinese herbs have entered the western pharmacopoeia; the earliest and best known is perhaps ginseng.
imagine what it takes to make videos, write books, travel the world getting in front of hundreds and thousands of people to share a message of hope and healing in a world so full of suffering and destruction.
from yet another direction, the “higher reflection” in a sense themother of raw, living diets, can be seen in the traditions and disciplines ofplant dietas.
it has been many years since i have seen a dentist (i was 12 the last time i can remember having an appointment with one), and as it is with so many aspects of living, i have found it far more rewarding to take care of myself, rather than turning my health over to others.
and our arrogance in trying to continually conquer the universe rather than communicate with it, has kept us from being taught those secrets.
how i arrived at this… as i began experimenting with tissue detoxification using zeolites and clay, it dawned on me that these, when rendered into a fine flour-like powder, have just the right amount of abrasiveness to take the place of the toothpaste
for instance, methods for removing radioactive isotopes from our body fat, muscles and bones, pcb’s and other industrial chemicals from our lipid stores, and keeping genetically modified bio-pollutants out of our bodies will become as common place as removing plaque from your teeth or dirt from beneath your fingernails.
further, pollan suggests, in his “plants-eye view” ted talk, that “looking at the world from other species’ points of view is a cure for the disease of human self-importance.”
survival is bare minimum, surthrival is abundant, and even opulent.
despite this, and even because of it, nettle has been used as food and medicine by many cultures and is an important species for those of us who practice foraging, herbalism, or primitive outdoor skills.
the photos are very clear and the descriptions have been written by someone who has actually used the plants to the ends described therein (believe me, this is not the norm).
i’m talking about the spirit of the creek, the bricks in your house, the hundreds of spirits roaming your kitchen.
all three of us are so focused on creating the life that we desire, each of us so good at what we do, that we have all become characters as archetypical as those found in the pages of a comic book.
in contrast to many wild foraged plants, wild rice requires a more considerable amount of know how and equipment to locate, access, harvest, and process, so to show this in its entirety is simply outside the scope of a blog post.
daniel will be sharing tips on the kinds of things a person can do to rewild themselves and what it could mean to our health.
that is all changing for me now that i have learned to forage a few key items, perhaps the greatest and most important, of which is wild rice.
we add to that the “probiotic” organism (these are healthy, symbiotic micro-organisms) that will be performing the fermentation (here it will be lactobacillus).
aside from the vegetables that keep in my cellar (onions, squashes, garlic) and the vegetables i have frozen (wild fiddle heads, japanese knotweed) lacto-ferments are my main source of “living” vegetation.
food, water, air, and sunlight, are the critical elements for nourishing our bodies, and we will be covering these topics in depth.
the reason i share these videos and information is to demonstrate that the issues with radiation did not begin fukushima, or even with chernobyl, but with the “silent” nuclear war that has already happened on earth.
that is because this seminar has the worlds leading health authorities, all gathered in one place for a whole weekend, to share their unique knowledge around health and longevity.

now that i am just weeks away from surthrival’s launch of its new pine pollen extracts, i wanted to share a video that is yet one more piece of my natural hormone maintnance strategy.
there are those online whodo take this far too seriously and are constantly leveling accusations, and cruel and harsh words against us.
i have just finished preparing my presentation, called “habitat, your guide to intentional lifestyle design” which will focus on specific strategies for more than just vigorous health, but epi-genetic wealth.
each presenter brings to us their unique skillset and education around optimal health and longevity.
through this quest i have become enamoured by cider, which is the proper name for the fermented alcoholic draught made from the fresh pressed juice from apples.
we will be covering a very comprehensive lifestyle approach that can – and i believe will – give one the confidence to step into the world each day with a sense of abundant growth, rather and fear and uncertainty.
wild rice however, is a complex carbohydrate (macro-nutrient), and unlike the mono-cropped and refined carbohydrates of the average american diet, is a rich whole food grain loaded with vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) as well.
from “organic” store-bought toothpaste brands, to tooth soaps and powders, and even aboriginal “chew sticks” – nothing has been the right fit for my self-dentistry needs.
most americans are deficient in micronutrients even to the rda standard (recommended daily allowances of the u.s. national academy of sciences) which is surprisingly low when compared against the nutrient intakes of so called “primitive peoples”.
essentially, plants can do whatever they want with humans, and with near-absolute impunity.
and our arrogance in trying to continually conquer the universe rather than communicate with it, has kept us from being taught those secrets.
hour after hour i burned to know and meet the species who’s berry drupes splatter painted pink the otherwise indistinguishable wall of sub-tropic greenery that lined the highway 75.
~daniel ps, check out this podcast i recently did where we discuss the history of grains and agriculture, as well as some must have information on making the grains you use a safe and healthy food!
i think that foragers of all skill level and in a variety of eco-ranges will benefit from this work.
they were not viewed as guilt laden pleasures or sources of immoral behavior and debauchery, but rather as sacred and vitally health supportive.
aside from the occasional whole foods splurge, i don’t suspect i will be eating very many fresh green vegetables until the wild spring shoots emerge after the thaw.

if this wasn’t enough, phyto-chemicals in nettle root further work to prevent benign prostate hyperplasia (bph) by stopping the binding of dht to the prostate membrane.
from creating healthy habitat within your own home, to protecting yourself from the radioactive fallout that is, even now, blanketing the northern hemisphere.
there is so much i am excited to share, from creating and implementing a healthy and well developed natural diet, to finding the cleanest and purest water available to keep your body hydrated.
i will be teaming up again with rawflora this year for a one time only costa rican adventure, and have a limited amount of space available for those who want to have a special experience at the tail end of this year’s winter!
this will be a robust and fully developed workshop covering hundreds of aspects of personal health sovereignty, loaded with tips, techniques, and strategies for those of us who are ushering in the new paradigm on earth.

if you would like to see the rest of thetalk, as well as those presented by the rest of the longevity now speakers, it is available here.
the results are his latest book which you can find here.
and once they can do that they can interact with those spirits.
also, i feel the need to point out the obvious here: people buy products from myself or my colleagues because we carry extremely good products, products that help people.
i have had the opportuntiy to forage wild foods for a few years now, with each season yielding greater and greater amounts of food.
to say that i am grateful would hardly do justice to this exuberant emotion.
honestly, i feel sorry for people like that, people who are too closed down in their hearts to display the lightness of being that initiates human bonding.
i believe in us, i believe in our ability as a species to make it through even the most challenging times.

to compliment and expand on my video, i have also included a video with botanist arthur haines detailing how he taps his maples, and prepares his maple syrup.
i get so excited every time it snows here, and though some people find it challenging to live through this kind of cold and dark, i must say that even more than loving it,  i am fascinated by it.
for the last couple of weeks myself and several good friends and great acquaintances have been working together diligently to get the word out about the 16 dvd set that was filmed last september at the longevity now conference in costa mesa, ca.
further, pollan suggests, in his “plants-eye view” ted talk, that “looking at the world from other species’ points of view is a cure for the disease of human self-importance.”
in fact, learning to properly construct and burn a fire has meant far more to me than just having another survival skill.
each speaker is very different from the others, and holds a piece of information that could be the piece that you are looking for.
of course the beverages fermented by native peoples and by our traditional cultural forebearers were much healthier and nutritionally viable than those of today, created with local ingredients and wild yeasts, and were not filtered and pasturized like the ones that most of us were raised around.
they are so obsessed, and take it allso seriously that they have committed their lives to displaying hatred and spewing vitriol, claiming that their way, their method, their diet, is the only viable truth.
if you are woman reading this pay close attention.
there are of course wonderful uses for chaga with its bark on as well, particularly as an anti-neoplastic medicine.
this means that as a forager i am still largely dependent on my local agricultural system to provide me with calories that i need to live out my daily life.
also, this is an excellent resource for herbalists or those interested in herbal medicine, as each plants pharmacology and mode of action are broken down in a very explicit and comprehensible way.
for those who don’t know, chaga is a fungal sclerotium with notable anti-cancer  terpines (such as betulinic acid) and immune system modulating sugars (called beta glucans).
also, i want to let you know that though this book was written for plants of the north east, dozens of the plants here will be found throughout north america, and even beyond.
significantly, it’s acleanse – of body, of mind – and by extension, environment.
whats more, the flowing sap of the maple tree is the first wild food to emerge after a long and cold snow covered new england winter.
from creating healthy habitat within your own home, to protecting yourself from the radioactive fallout that is, even now, blanketing the northern hemisphere.
it inhabits the shallow waters of lakes, ponds, and slow moving rivers.
in full honesty, i don’t believe that most of – or even many of – the human beings alive today will carry forth their genetic material into the future.
the primary fermentative organism present in these kinds of preserves is lactobacillus acidophilus (who’s name means “acid loving milk bacteria”) one of our bodies primary microbial symbionts.
the roll of shamanic knowledge for us westerners introduced to those spirits is to spread that knowledge, make communication easier.
plants, and plant-time, are like crop circles (which of course are made of plants in most cases) – like magic, they appear, leave traces, clues, fruit, messages.
here is a little bit more information on the event, as well as the kripalu center itself.
for those of you who are interested in going deeper, i would highly recommend an e-book by my good friend nadine artemis called “successful self-dentistry, how to avoid the dentist without ignoring your teeth”.
for us to continue, for us to clean up the mess we have collectively made, we will have to, as a species, choose to walk down a new path.
invite the forces of nature, say an orange or a mushroom, and with the right kind of eyes – grow further infused with infinite ecologies of everlasting spirits.
i put this up to demonstrate how simple it is to produce your own wild nettle root tincture for use as an herbal medicine.
something i could practice daily as a way to learn from, and build relations with numerous “common” plants like kale, chard, chia, blueberries, tomatoes, pears, for example.
this online workshop will delve deeply into human domestication and the affects of an alkaloid-poor diet.
the plants led me out of concrete jungles, cured any concrete ideologies and crumbling health i might carry – hold my gaze and engage my commitment to unfolding endeavors of evolutionary advantage – wild foods, living water, permaculture, forest gardening, medicinal mushrooms, herbalism, synaesthesia…
i want to extend a big thanks to the longevity now conference for all they have done to make this happen.
i want to emphasize, the synbiotic is a new food, not the sum of the original parts, this is why sauerkraut is not “cabbage”, and wine is not “grape juice”.
as you can probably tell, i am an avid “foodie” so i have made sure there will be an abundance of fresh local fruits and vegetables, wild fish and seafood, as well as local goat milk and cheese!
this video is for all of you who celebrate being grown-ups, and are unafraid to raise yourselves up and out of the near ubiquitousneoteny that is now standard in the epi-genome in our “modernized” population.
however, the heart of this guidance was clear: ayahuasca, once drank, prefers to live in, and works better with; clean bodies.
i promise a profound and moving experience in this workshop.
this video is about the strategies that i have been employing since the japan disaster earlier this year.
the apple juice i have worked with begins to ferment almost immediately after it reaches room temperature, and in truth gets better each and every day that it sits.

each day is packed with truly exciting adventures, from visits to cacao plantations to white water rafting down a deep jungle river, from a forest canopy eco adventure to visits with the local shaman for healing jungle herbs.
this is a huge deal considering the amount of knowledge, connections, goodies, and community you will leave with after the weekend!click
finally curiosity got the better of me, and i decided to do what any avid forager would –  i  pulled over to have a taste.
despite this, and even because of it, nettle has been used as food and medicine by many cultures and is an important species for those of us who practice foraging, herbalism, or primitive outdoor skills.
there will also be a 90-minute panel, where the audience members can ask us all of their burning question!
in fact, when someone neglects this important bit of personal cleanliness, the rest of us can be easily turned off.
that said, each of us faces innumerable challenges to our health everyday, from the simple habituated patterns that have been passed on to us from the generations past, to more complex issues like genetically modified foods and radioactive fallout that have emerged more recently as a result of our rapidly developing technologies.
i am expecting this to be a very intimate event, with lots of time for personal exchanges, questions and answers, and exploration of territory that isn’t always easy to cover in a one night talk.
due to its status as florida’s floral-enemy-number-one, we can harvest its berries with a kind of impunity that is rarely experienced by the modern forager.
you can find all the details and register here.
and while this presents ecological issues in southern florida, it produces a tremendous surplus of wild food for the keenly aware forager.
now speakers, it is available here.
and while this presents ecological issues in southern florida, it produces a tremendous surplus of wild food for the keenly aware forager.
while i hadn’t had personal experience with this plant before, i do have plenty of experience with the principles of wild food identification, harvest, and processing, and each of these skills translate well from biome to biome, from one eco-system to the next.
matt monarch has ceaslessly brought more and more products to us at hisraw food world , and runs one of the tightest ships i have ever seen.
through this quest i have become enamoured by cider, which is the proper name for the fermented alcoholic draught made from the fresh pressed juice from apples.
as each season goes by and my skills in this area increase, not only have i developed a strong sense of food security, my direct relationship to the earth as an abundant and loving provider continues to increases.
which has left us losing out on so much we might have learned.
i want to emphasize, the synbiotic is a new food, not the sum of the original parts, this is why sauerkraut is not “cabbage”, and wine is not “grape juice”.
please keep in mind that this toothpaste, in addition to providing the mild abrasive qualities we have become accustomed to in our commercially available toothpaste preparations, is designed to pull toxic cations out of the body, and to be an aid in our overall radio-protection strategy (protection from radioactive isotopes).
it might not be easy, though that doesn’t mean it can’t be exciting – and yes… maybe even fun.
as public speakers and figures, there is a tremendous amount of pressure placed on us from all directions, as this is the nature of the work that we do.
you the reader may have encountered some of the harassing internet trolling that each of us has had to endure.
which has left us losing out on so much we might have learned.
chemical and radiation exposure, emf’s, xeno-estrogens, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, and a host of other health pitfalls will also be addressed to ensure that each participant can protect and detoxify themselves from these safely and adequately.

i will be teaming up again with rawflora this year for a one time only costa rican adventure, and have a limited amount of space available for those who want to have a special experience at the tail end of this year’s winter!
the class has been filling up rather quickly these last few weeks, and we are getting very excited for the spring foraging to begin!
most of the wild plants that i have been learning to use are incredibly nutritious (as well as delicious) but a bit low in calories.
many wild foraged plants are eaten like vegetables (stinging nettle come to mind) but lack the energy density that we get from meats, grains, oils, concentrated sugars.
in the new orleans “jungleland” – behind climates of chaos and the media newsfeed, burnt cars and dead bodies are consumed by tall grass.
those individuals who are more adapted to a particular environment will be healthier and will produce more offspring than those less suited to an environment.
i had met stephen at a workshop he gave in british columbia (here is an interview i did with him) and having become friends, asked if he would be willing to collaborate with myself and the surthrival team on a pine pollen herbal-monograph.
not only does lactobacillus acidophilus allow us to preserve and even increase the amount of nutrition in our vegetables, but it also aids in digestion and increases our immunity too!
those individuals who are more adapted to a particular environment will be healthier and will produce more offspring than those less suited to an environment.
after 14 years of using a neti pot on a regular, almost daily basis – i must admit, i am amazed how overlooked this basic bit of personal hygiene is.
null null most of us were taught to spit our toothpaste out, which, given the host of less-than-beneficial ingredients (particularly fluoride) is pretty sound advice.
hand harvested, sundried, fire parched, foot treaded, and wind winnowed wild rice is so soft and delicate in flavor that it simply has to be tasted to be understood.
be sure to contact us soon, as the class size is very limited.
if you can’t make it to the event, but would like to watch the video stream, here isthe link where you can sign up to watch at home.
i have now arrived at a strategy that is really working wonders for me, and i feel could really work for you too.
it does not mean we are contending with one another, and certainly doesn’t affect our friendship or support of eachother.
there are not many wild foods that taste particularly sweet here in new england, but maple syrup is certainly the exception.
most americans are deficient in micronutrients even to the rda standard (recommended daily allowances of the u.s. national academy of sciences) which is surprisingly low when compared against the nutrient intakes of so called “primitive peoples”.
organisms native to the area where you are fermenting, or – as is the case with cabbage – are indigenous to the food itself.

“what ayahuasca teaches is that right now, at every moment, we already live in the magic forest.”
in other words, once you have tried it and felt what clean and clear sinus cavities feel like, you won’t want to go back.
i really believe there is such a lifestyle, and living it is so much more exciting and rewarding than the life that most of us were born to.
this film is a beautiful depiction of how that is happening.
our ability to generate and maintain fire is a powerful thing indeed, so it is our intention to pass on not just the skill, but the ethics of stewardship as well.
i have a good sense of the tastes of poisons, and this strategy has rarely failed me ( i will spare you the tale of the time i tried a taste of “jack-in-the-pulpit”.
and once they can do that they can interact with those spirits.

this video post is about peeling chaga, which is its traditional preparation method in siberia (it is from their folk medicine that we have learned of chaga).
with this in mind, i set forth exploring a raw food diet – with sharp eyes and a healthy aversion to dogma and definitions.
each speaker is very different from the others, and holds a piece of information that could be the piece that you are looking for.
he or she has the ability to witness events like those that recently struck japan, and while maintaining a sense of empathy and compassion, takes the necessary steps to protect themselves, their health, and that of those they love.

my company surthrival recently started carrying what we feel are the most beautiful and durable ceramic neti pots available anywhere, andyou can get one for yourself right here on our newly designed website (we are pretty excited about this)!
the neti pot gives us the ability to clean our upper respiratory tract, in much the same way that a toothbrush cleans our mouth or a shower washes our skin, before these particles can accumulate or be drawn deeper.
for years i used this fungus without peeling it, which yeilded wonderful results, but now that i have included the traditional preperation method, it would be difficult to depart from.
my company,surthrival, is my contribution to peoples health and healing and is my way of operating economically in a world that demands this of me.
here is another video from my archive showing how to identify and harvest chaga if you are interested in trying this yourself.
imagine what it takes to make videos, write books, travel the world getting in front of hundreds and thousands of people to share a message of hope and healing in a world so full of suffering and destruction.
with childlike enthusiasm, we have been texting back and forth each day to see how much sap the others trees have produced!
the world and its spirits don’t really care if we do, for the most part.
watching the season change, feeling the solar low just before we emerge into the spring, seeing the tracks of the animals who move like ghosts through this icy, crystalline landscape, all of this brings out the wonder of a child in me!
in the second half of the video i’ve included a recipe that i have been making with fresh maple water, chaga, and a bit of cream.
lacto-fermentation, the kind of vegetable fermentation that produces foods like sauerkraut (as well as kimchee and brined pickles), preserves our food in lactic acid, and was one of the dominant preservation techniques used by our ancestors before sugar and preservatives became the norm.
thats not hype, i have literally been taking it everywhere.
i think it is an inspired and poignant summation of the plant medicine path, and especially thesynthesis of food, medicine, and the realm of entheogenic plants in the human ecological niche.
p.p.s.  i understand the many detrimental effects that alcoholism and alcohol related accidents have had on us as individuals and as a civilization.
for me, lacto-ferments like sauerkraut are one of my primary ways of preserving and consuming local vegetables through out the long maine winters.
the exotic sweet and spicy aromatic flavor of these brittle pink berries was well worth the risk, and i was certain i was on the trail of a new wild food ally.
it is quickly claiming more and more habitat for itself, displacing native species from their long held habitat.
the businesses that each of us run are beautiful, thriving, life promoting operations and each of them is working to support the vision that each of us share for the world.
the newly emerging scientific field of “epigenetics” is rapidly confirming the obvious fact, our habitat and lifestyle choices, from what we eat and breath to what we wear and think not only impacts our health but actually influences our gene expression!
we are also excited to have a booth in the exhibition area for my company, surthrival, all weekend long at the event!
into which, ayahuasca digs deep, purging junk, transforming thoughts, composting things, creating soil from soul, turning the stomach into a womb, encouraging conditions right, good, and fertile – so it can root, grow, and flower.
i hope this motivates you to get out and harvest some food or medicine for yourself.
this workshop is being called “the masters workshop”, and it will be a comprehensive lecture between myself, david wolfe, and truth caulkins where we will go in depth about elixircrafting, the art of tonic alchemy, the secrets to abundant health, complete cell rejuvenation, and longevity.
as for the technique and specifics, i will let this video explain the rest.
while the aerial parts of the plant (the parts that grow above the ground) are most commonly eaten as a pot herb (cooked) or made into infusions (teas), it is the roots from which we can extract its potent androgenic substances.
the longevity now conference dvd’s are amazing.
the newly emerging scientific field of “epigenetics” is rapidly confirming the obvious fact, our habitat and lifestyle choices, from what we eat and breath to what we wear and think not only impacts our health but actually influences our gene expression!
trees will be here long after we’re gone, and so will stones and bricks and clouds and the moon.
three days gives us time to deeply explore the lifestyle that is the theme of this workshop.
honestly, i feel sorry for people like that, people who are too closed down in their hearts to display the lightness of being that initiates human bonding.
you will gain tremendous knowledge and be supporting a wonderful and important cause.
there is a globulin in human blood calledsex hormone binding globulin (shbg) which binds to testosterone, rendering it unavailable to the our cells.
stephen, in addition to being a prolific writer on herbal craft and lore, is a poet and word-smith par excellence.
it has been many years since i have seen a dentist (i was 12 the last time i can remember having an appointment with one), and as it is with so many aspects of living, i have found it far more rewarding to take care of myself, rather than turning my health over to others.
we also feel privileged to share the basics of fire-craft with our friends and clients because so many of us were never taught how to properly or efficiently build or maintain a fire.
nettle root is an herbal ally that seems almost designed to ensure the good health of a mans reproductive system into longevity (wives and girlfriends may want to take note).
this universe is full full full of life and life force.
this is particularly perplexing since the pollen of pine trees has been used for millennia in china and korea as both food and a particularly powerful tonic and adaptogen, especially for the elderly.
here is another video from my archive showing how to identify and harvest chaga if you are interested in trying this yourself.
for us to continue, for us to clean up the mess we have collectively made, we will have to, as a species, choose to walk down a new path.
the tonic bar team will be providing us with the most powerful, delicious healing drinks only available through this wonderful crew.
making your own nettle root tinctures at home can be easy, and only takes few minutes.
the case with clay is very similar, though the phenomena in this case is referred to as adsorption, which is also an electrical binding, but in this case to the surface of the clay particle and without the accompanying exchange of a cation.
an open source invitation into deeper relation with the many things that fuel, heal, and energize us; that which is alive all around us, co-createswith us.
my lecture will revolve around eugenics and what “natural foods” really are, in this day and age.
each of us is simply bringing forward the health strategy that has fueled our unique missions and passions, and each of us does this in our own unique style.
the surthriver understands the health challenges inherent in our modern world, and yet chooses to thrive despite them.
what if there was a lifestyle that protected your health, increased your ability to express your personal potential, kept your body clear of industrial, agricultural, radioactive and genetic pollution, protected your fertility, your stamina, your libido, and increased your will and desire to care for all of life?
it’s a great place to stock up on great winter immune system supplements, such as medicinal mushroom extracts and colostrum.
check out the video below to hear more about ancestral ignition , and to see acclaimed botanist, author, and my foraging and aboriginal skills guide and all around friend, arthur haines, make a fire with a primitive tool known as the bow drill.
cider is usually defined as having an alcohol content of 2 – 8.5 % or higher, though my experience is that it tastes great and is incredibly refreshing even during initial fermentation when the alcohol content is negligible like that of kombucha.
we also feel privileged to share the basics of fire-craft with our friends and clients because so many of us were never taught how to properly or efficiently build or maintain a fire.
plants, fungi and bacteria are significantly adept at piloting humans.
those who remain will have to be more than survivors, they will be surthrivalists.
after years of hosting events and retreats, we have learned what powerful transformational tools these kinds of workshops can be.
i believe in us, i believe in our ability as a species to make it through even the most challenging times.
from my perspective, it appears that a diet that lacks the geophagy pattern could not be called a “natural diet” at all, as it would essentially be deficient in these all-important compounds.
it is quickly claiming more and more habitat for itself, displacing native species from their long held habitat.
and while we use the term “intoxicant” to refer to drinks that contain alcohol, these people didn’t associate their sacred beverages with “toxicity” at all.
people choose to purchase these products because they add value to their lives and health, and because they feel good about putting their money back into the economic networks that support what they believe in.
i have used this strategy, along side others, such as regular sauna use (check out clearlight saunas, it is the brand of infrared sauna that i have in my home), a clean whole food diet containing lots of wild foods and herbs,drinking natural spring water, implimenting regular functional exercise, all combined with and tied together with time spent in nature.
the behavior is termed“geophagy”, and is unquestionably part of the species-specific diet of human beings.
we will literally cover healthful living from conception to the grave and beyond.
our ancestors ate extremely micronutrient dense diets when compared against our own.
cider is so easy to produce at homea cave man could do it!
i have had the opportuntiy to forage wild foods for a few years now, with each season yielding greater and greater amounts of food.
ancestral plants is different, this book just seems to have it all.
the main focus of this retreat is to share theancient and ancestral skill of aboriginal friction fire with all of those who attend.
in fact, when someone neglects this important bit of personal cleanliness, the rest of us can be easily turned off.
these are made right here in the state of maine (where we are based out of) and i have personally tested them now for almost a decade and a half, so i can honestly tell you they are the best around.
this has been, by far, my most prolific year of harvesting wild food and medicine.
working safely and respectfully with ayahuasca and other teacher plants, alongside raw food/garden-variety plants, the teacher’s assistants so to speak, leads, of course, to many physical and spiritual benefits.
the reason i share these videos and information is to demonstrate that the issues with radiation did not begin fukushima, or even with chernobyl, but with the “silent” nuclear war that has already happened on earth.
ancestral plants uses a series of icons to denote the possible uses of a plant  (a little fire icon for plants with fire uses, an arrow for plants with uses in archery, etc), and then the text details how, when, and which parts of a plant can be used in this way.
most of the wild plants that i have been learning to use are incredibly nutritious (as well as delicious) but a bit low in calories.
they provide an exotic spiciness to any dish, from sweet to savory, and they come with the added percieved benefit of being from my own personal harvest.
earlier in the year i had the culturally enriching experience of imbibing some of the traditional fermented beverages of south america, specificallychicha (from maize) and masatao (fromcassava), both traditional ferments of the people of peru.
fermentation can seem a bit intimidating when you haven’t tried it before, and that is why i am posting this video.
these wonderful drinks were both relatively low in alcohol, with probably just a bit less than a modern beer, and loaded with nutrition and calories, making them as much a food as a drink.
i had met stephen at a workshop he gave in british columbia (here is an interview i did with him) and having become friends, asked if he would be willing to collaborate with myself and the surthrival team on a pine pollen herbal-monograph.
what an opportunity it is for me to spend three days with you amidst kripalu’s gorgeous spring settings, with its wonderful food and renowned staff.
in fact, learning to properly construct and burn a fire has meant far more to me than just having another survival skill.
plants, i’ve found, often speak in terms of one’s present perception – in shapeshifting symbols that change as you follow them, conversations to discern and decipher.
to ensure the continued integrity of this site and the quality experience that it provides for our users, we now post all comments on an approval-first basis.
my company,surthrival, became the first to bring a fully developed pine pollen product line to the natural foods market place in north america.
stinging nettle (urtica dioica) is an herbaceous perennial flowering plant known by many of us for the painful stinging hairs (they are actually called “trichomes”) that inject histamine into our skin like micro hypodermic needles.
the thing we intend to ferment is known as a “prebiotic” (i am using this term loosely, don’t tell the scientists), this is the food source (sugars) for the organisms that will be converting the food into a fermented-food (in our case cabbage).
because our epi-genetics are influenced by everything in our environment, the lifestyle we have lived has shaped us into some new and all together different creature.
eating and drinking is intimate communication.
check out this 12 minute video clip (click on the image below) of the talk i delivered in costa mesa last october titled, “developing sovereign health: the path of  rewilding ourselves”.
for those who don’t know, chaga is a fungal sclerotium with notable anti-cancer terpines (such as betulinic acid) and immune system modulating sugars (called beta glucans).
homo sapiens have a long and rich history with psychoactive plant medicines, and they have always been a part of our traditional diets.
yet perhaps most importantly, the process has opened, and continues to expand, a certain grandpermeability – pathways and bridges between common ground and the sky – between day-to-day and ceremonial nights.
the fact that we ordered different dishes does not mean we are in nutritional opposition to one another.
storing vegetables for the winter is a critical skill, and lacto-fermentation has some advantages that are hard to beat.
my hope is that our community will immediately see the value of this handy little device and add it to the tool-belt of practices and skills that are helping us to thrive in, and adapt to our modern environment.
we have chosen the intimate class size to ensure that each of you gets the close personal attention you need, and to ensure that we don’t trample our wild foraging grounds.
rather, and more vital to our personal healing – as well as to the continuation of life as we know it – is our becoming acquainted with the organism producing the food or medicine itself.
actually, i was reading a few of his books and found myself particularly spellbound by the section on pine pollen and its incredible androgenic effects.
this workshop will be fully catered with organic, local food, prepared by chef frank giglio, who is one of my best friends and a truly culinary mentor of mine.
as you can probably tell, i am an avid “foodie” so i have made sure there will be an abundance of fresh local fruits and vegetables, wild fish and seafood, as well as local goat milk and cheese!
aside from the vegetables that keep in my cellar (onions, squashes, garlic) and the vegetables i have frozen (wild fiddle heads, japanese knotweed) lacto-ferments are my main source of “living” vegetation.
our ancestors ate extremely micronutrient dense diets when compared against our own.
the second is a documentary called trinity, and it shows with nothing less than truly epic footage, the history of these tests.
what a wonderful feeling to know that this winter i will be eating more of my calories from foods that were sustainably harvested from my local landscape.
and thus far, for most of us throughout mankind’s short history on this planet, that effort has not been made.
he or she has the ability to witness events like those that recently struck japan, and while maintaining a sense of empathy and compassion, takes the necessary steps to protect themselves, their health, and that of those they love.
ok, a little caveat, we might not actually add the probiotic, but rather let it colonize itself, in what is called a “wild fermentation”, as is the case here with sauerkraut.
plants, and plant-time, are like crop circles (which of course are made of plants in most cases) – like magic, they appear, leave traces, clues, fruit, messages.
for those of us who are developing or returning to our ancestral health through traditional and indigenous nutritional practices, few food preparation skills are as valuable to possess as lacto-fermentation.
our environment is changing faster than our minds can keep pace with, and this change is pressuring our biology to adapt at what are now nearly break neck speeds.
as public speakers and figures, there is a tremendous amount of pressure placed on us from all directions, as this is the nature of the work that we do.
seating is limited, so register soon!
it is 3 days long, catered by chef frank giglio with all local organic and wild food, and taught by myself and wild food expertarthur haines.
that said, each of us faces innumerable challenges to our health everyday, from the simple habituated patterns that have been passed on to us from the generations past, to more complex issues like genetically modified foods and radioactive fallout that have emerged more recently as a result of our rapidly developing technologies.
i will be talking aboutrewilding and transcending human domestication, and how we can stay strong, healthy, and actively-fit for a lifetime in a world that constantly pushing us towards a deeper state of domestication.
this video is a quick peek into my spring cleansing strategy which is most welcomed after a lengthy season of living indoors.
we really believe that stewardship of this ancient fire-craft is valuable for many reasons, not the least of which is the carrying on of what is one of our most ancient and fundamental human technologies.
i was immediately impressed with the way that these were built into the nutritional and spiritual systems of the area.
this film is a beautiful depiction of how that is happening.
i have a good sense of the tastes of poisons, and this strategy has rarely failed me ( i will spare you the tale of the time i tried a taste of “jack-in-the-pulpit”.
the few hours that followed are little more than a blur, and if it wasn’t for the record kept in the footage i am about to share with you, i would’t have believed that it even happened.
you can check out lots of my past interviews with him (as well as hundreds of other amazing guests) in hisextensive audio archives .
lactobacillus takes up residence in our small intestine, creating a kind of probiotic bio-shield in the gut, where it aggressively out-competes other dys-biotic organisms that can cause us to fall ill.
from my perspective it’s a kind of plant artistry.
we exist as businesses because we carry things that people want.
there are not many wild foods that taste particularly sweet here in new england, but maple syrup is certainly the exception.
it is the strengthened engagement with the harmony of humanity – the beautiful songs we’ve sung and are singing, our peak performance, the best of the best – that boils down to our collective necessities – food, medicine, life – from which can be drawn ever-expanding analogies, inter-elated metaphor, and metamorphosis.
in fact, for much of the year i use it almost daily and have for several years now… chaga is normally decocted (boiled in water to produce a broth or tea) for about two hours, yielding a very mild vanilla like flavor (it containsvanillin as one of its components) which is great to drink on its own, with added cream and a sweetener (i like maple syrup) to create a drink much like coffee.
perhaps it is because they make their money in ways they are not so proud of.
our lodge sits directly on a private tropical beach, where the noni trees grow abundantly to meet the gentle lick of the caribbean sea.
make no mistake, we stand before the greatest evolutionary event our species has ever known.
none of us would be wrong for what we ordered, it is just a menu after all.
aside from the occasional whole foods splurge, i don’t suspect i will be eating very many fresh green vegetables until the wild spring shoots emerge after the thaw.
stephen, in addition to being a prolific writer on herbal craft and lore, is a poet and word-smith par excellence.
de-barking chaga yields a far more mild, pleasant tasting, less medicinal and more tonic tea.
we strive to put on events that can nourish the body, inform the mind, and touch the spirit.
more than this, it also prevents the conversion of testosterone into a metabolite known as dihydrotestosterone, which has been implicated in benign prostate hyperplasia and even male pattern baldness.
actually, i was reading a few of his books and found myself particularly spellbound by the section on pine pollen and its incredible androgenic effects.
because our epi-genetics are influenced by everything in our environment, the lifestyle we have lived has shaped us into some new and all together different creature.
i had the privilege of both publishing this book as well as writing the foreword, and am very excited to see it added  to the existing herbal literature.
you can learn a lot from arugula – even more from cacao, or from an elder like maize.
they will have to, as these things are rapidly destroying the integrity of our immune systems, our ability to reproduce, and even riddling our bodies with cancers.
organisms native to the area where you are fermenting, or – as is the case with cabbage – are indigenous to the food itself.
i have now arrived at a strategy that is really working wonders for me, and i feel could really work for you too.
eating well grown local food, drinking clean, fresh water, breathing clean and uncontaminated air, and receiving brilliant sunlight on our skin will once again become the norm, and again, this just might come about -for many at least- out of necessity before want.
none of us would be wrong for what we ordered, it is just a menu after all.
side with the plants, learn plants, eat plants, become plants – let food be your medicine, let medicine be your food – and begin to synthesize entirely different dimensions of time, technology, communication, and potential.
this video comes on the heels of the last video we released, which details how to make the toothpaste that is used in this dental care strategy.
the differences between us are beautiful and healthy, and ultimately what make this whole ride so much fun.
each of us orders something different from the menu, something that is suited our own unique taste, preference, whim, and health goals.
i have been highly involved in brewing my own mead for several months now, after learning the traditional nutrition that has been derived from this fermented beverage for ages.
while many people use probiotic supplements in an attempt to achieve these ends, most often lacto-fermented foods perform these tasks better, can be made at home from whole, fresh, local foods, are inexpensive, and add a considerable amount of quality nutrition in the form of highly absorbable predigested, living food.
in other words, we can use our environment and lifestyle to activate our genetic potential for a more robust experience of life on earth!
ancestral plants uses a series of icons to denote the possible uses of a plant (a little fire icon for plants with fire uses, an arrow for plants with uses in archery, etc), and then the text details how, when, and which parts of a plant can be used in this way.
essentially though, it is process of healing and strengthening.
to say that i am grateful would hardly do justice to this exuberant emotion.
for the last several years i have talked more about chaga (inonotus obliquus) than any other wild foraged food or medicine.
you can find all the details and register here.
in addition, each participant will receive a complimentary $40 earthing kit so that they will experience the healing effects of being grounded even while in their hotel room.
i feel very good about sharing these with you because i know how much quality information they contain, and how diverse that information is.
who knows what we have missed simply by not asking a plant what benefit it might have for mankind, rather than saying “tree, chop it and burn it for fire.”
in other words, once you have tried it and felt what clean and clear sinus cavities feel like, you won’t want to go back.
please keep in mind that this toothpaste, in addition to providing the mild abrasive qualities we have become accustomed to in our commercially available toothpaste preparations, is designed to pull toxic cations out of the body, and to be an aid in our overall radio-protection strategy (protection from radioactive isotopes).
actually, it is common to nearly all mammals, and in particular to broad ranging herbivores.
“as we begin (once again) to naturalize ourselves – both nutritionally and medicinally – we may begin to discover that there is far more to a plant than just its chemical composition, more than just its list of constituent phyto-nutrients, vitamins and minerals.
no harvest yet has supplied me with the amount of food energy that i was able to gather this september when i learned the ancient art of “ricing”.
this is the go-to book for understanding wild plants of the north east, and the one that will accompany me into the field this year and for years to come (mine is getting dog-eared already).
if plants – specifically teacher plants – convey anything, it is that they have the upper hand, the higher branch.
our work is the distillation of years of study and practice, and we could be celebrating the diversity that this has created.
what follows is a spoof of myself, david wolfe, and matt monarch all hanging out in my kitchen making the “longevity now conference 16 dvd set superfood tonic elixir smoothie”… i play all of the parts, and keep in mind that this was made on an extreme time budget.
no harvest yet has supplied me with the amount of food energy that i was able to gather this september when i learned the ancient art of “ricing”.
matt monarch has ceaslessly brought more and more products to us at hisraw food world , and runs one of the tightest ships i have ever seen.
i hope this motivates you to get out and harvest some food or medicine for yourself.
de-barking chaga yields a far more mild, pleasant tasting, less medicinal and more tonic tea.
also, on another note, my opening evening talk at the longevity now conference last april is now available for purchase in dvd format, in an 18-dvd set which includes the lectures from each of the other health educators who spoke at the conference!
"rewild yourself: tips & tricks for strengthening your epigenetic health" i also want to share this quick video clip of my good friend shailene woodley’s appearance on thelate night with jimmy fallon show (check out that clip right here)!
this will be a fun call, and patrick is never shy about taking me into edgy and interesting territory!
shailene has become a tremendous ally, helping to share the message ofrewilding, spring water, and indigenous nutrition with the world.
the plants led me out of concrete jungles, cured any concrete ideologies and crumbling health i might carry – hold my gaze and engage my commitment to unfolding endeavors of evolutionary advantage – wild foods, living water, permaculture, forest gardening, medicinal mushrooms, herbalism, synaesthesia… yet perhaps most importantly, the process has opened, and continues to expand, a certain grandpermeability – pathways and bridges between common ground and the sky – between day-to-day and ceremonial nights.
this workshop is the three days long, just enough time to share an entire, coherent, and well organized method for insuring your surthrival into the 21st century, and i am feeling very honored for the opportunity to do so.
truth caulkins, one of the speakers, brings us a world-class longevity tonic bar which will be open all weekend long!
if your looking to smog proof your sinuses, help to prevent sinus issues in general, and improve your respiratory health, give the neti pot a try.
thats not hype, i have literally been taking it everywhere.
the thing we intend to ferment is known as a “prebiotic” (i am using this term loosely, don’t tell the scientists), this is the food source (sugars) for the organisms that will be converting the food into a fermented-food (in our case cabbage).
though today much of the wild rice sold in the market place is cultivated in rice paddies, this highly nutritious grain is still available to the forager for the price of his or her labor.
the entire book is extensively footnoted so that you can access the scientific literature from which so much of this information has been compiled.
celebrated kripalu center may 20th – 22nd for our invincible health workshop, a weekend of inspiration, invigoration, and community building with other’s who share your passions, your insights, and your lifestyle.
synbiotics like sauerkraut have long been used by those before us to fortify their immune systems, assist in digestion (their acidity helps to lower the ph of the stomach increasing the effectiveness of our hydrochloric acid), and to maintain healthy levels of the probiotic organisms that colonize our digestive lumen.
it is the open, clear, and relaxed sense of breathing; the ability to fully utilize your respiration that makes you conscious of its importance.
also, i will be at the longevity now conference in april (1st-3rd), and will be making tickets for the upcoming conference available soon…  so…  stay tuned, i might just be forced to top this last video!
through the alchemy of the fermentative process something new will be created, and that new thing is known as the “synbiotic”.
here is a little bit more information on the event, as well as the kripalu center itself.
i have personally been witness to it in my own life amongst people that i love dearly.
we will have our full product line up for sale at our booth, along with some surprises we are waiting to reveal for the first time at the conference!
otherwise, we simply carry this debris around, haphazardly sneezing or blowing it out, or letting it drain back into our throats…
your time here is very appreciated.
it inhabits the shallow waters of lakes, ponds, and slow moving rivers.
otherwise, we simply carry this debris around, haphazardly sneezing or blowing it out, or letting it drain back into our throats…  blah!
on this interview, daniel will be speaking about his latest research into thereclassification of modern humans as a new subspecies.
i promise if you give it just one week of consistent practice, not only will you easily master this skill, but you will have a life long practice that will contribute to your health and personal detoxification strategy.
the survivalist too often operates from a place of fear and uncertainty.
this means that as a forager i am still largely dependent on my local agricultural system to provide me with calories that i need to live out my daily life.
turning simple sugars into ethanol, amino acids, and b complex vitamins, not to mention a culturally and ritually significant inebriant is a nearly ubiquitous human behavior, and part of what holds the fabric of traditional societies together.
wild rice however, is a complex carbohydrate (macro-nutrient), and unlike the mono-cropped and refined carbohydrates of the average american diet, is a rich whole food grain loaded with vitamins and minerals (micronutrients) as well.
each of us orders something different from the menu, something that is suited our own unique taste, preference, whim, and health goals.
whats more, the flowing sap of the maple tree is the first wild food to emerge after a long and cold snow covered new england winter.
this video is a message to those people.
for instance, lacto-fermentaion actually increases the amount of nutrition that was present in the vegetable alone (by converting sugars into protein rich bacterial bodies, b vitamins, and omega 3 fatty acids), increase the bio-availability of the existing nutrition (by breaking down cell walls by predigesting the vegetables cellulose, and removing anti-nutrients) and all the while preserving the inherent nutrition better than freezing, canning, or drying!
into which, ayahuasca digs deep, purging junk, transforming thoughts, composting things, creating soil from soul, turning the stomach into a womb, encouraging conditions right, good, and fertile – so it can root, grow, and flower.
so it’s really up to us to take an interest if we are to make the friendship of those spirits.
homo sapiens have a long and rich history with psychoactive plant medicines, and they have always been a part of our traditional diets.
it’s a great place to stock up on great winter immune system supplements, such as medicinal mushroom extracts and colostrum.
this has been, by far, my most prolific year of harvesting wild food and medicine.
gorman apr 06, 2012 | audio podcasts, current projects, interviews, wild food & water, written word | view comments it was a tremendous honor to be a part of the new documentary film “hungry for change”.
watch the video above where i compare some of the features against other design-styles.
this past autumn was a really exciting time for my team and i, with so many of our projects coming to fruition and our message ofrewilding, spring water, and indigenous nutrition spreading around our community and beyond, faster than we ever imagined.
it says “you can never make fun of us better than we can of ourselves!”, and that living without humor in your life is more than ugly, it is unhealthy and violates one of realities prime directives.
ancestral plants finally, a wild food and medicine book that really delivers!
my hope is that our community will immediately see the value of this handy little device and add it to the tool-belt of practices and skills that are helping us to thrive in, and adapt to our modern environment.
optional, available at event $60 includes: ingredient kit ~ optional, available at event $40 includes: if you’d like to register for the full get your gear, brew your mead package, including admission, ingredients, and all brewing gear so you can take home your first batch of fermenting mead, register here.
this allows me to operate without fear, but remain in a dominant emotion of confidence.
for the last couple of weeks myself and several good friends and great acquaintances have been working together diligently to get the word out about the 16 dvd set that was filmed last september at the longevity now conference in costa mesa, ca.
one of those dvd’s is dedicated to the talks that i gave at the conference, and is the information that is most on my heart and mind now.
i have been highly involved in brewing my own mead for several months now, after learning the traditional nutrition that has been derived from this fermented beverage for ages.
one of the great things about a plant like this, is there there is no concern of over harvest.
we will have an experienced chef on hand to prepare our meals, and keep us fueled up for our exciting and dramatic daily excursions!
"rewild yourself: tips & tricks for strengthening your epigenetic health" i also want to share this quick video clip of my good friend shailene woodley’s appearance on thelate night with jimmy fallon show (check out that clip right here)!
however, in this day and age, most of us are unable to spend all of our time outdoors ~ that is where the grounding technology comes in.
their constant quest instead was securing the macronutrient (carbohydrate, lipid, and protein calories) that they required for their huge daily energy expenditures.
keep in mind that this practice, consuming clay and other earth compounds, is perhaps one of the oldest of all human behaviors.
aug 02, 2011 | current projects, featured videos, wild food & water, written word | view comments greetings friends, thanks for stopping by.
three days gives us time to deeply explore the lifestyle that is the theme of this workshop.
in full honesty, i don’t believe that most of – or even many of – the human beings alive today will carry forth their genetic material into the future.
this video is about the strategies that i have been employing since the japan disaster earlier this year.
this allows me to operate without fear, but remain in a dominant emotion of confidence.
pine pollen, given its potency, its similarity to ginseng in some of its actions, and its status as, perhaps,the premier phytoandrogen on the planet, should have been recognized long before now as the powerful medicinal it is.
more than that, it also lays out which plants may be useful as a fire resource (for friction fire, tinder etc), for cordage (plants that contain fibers that can be removed and braided in to cord), archery uses (woods that are optimal for making bows or arrows), and even uses like dyes, glues, and basketry.
what – so it provides certain answers in the form of nourishment – literally; “bringing (you) up, raising, fostering, supporting, preserving”.
chemical and radiation exposure, emf’s, xeno-estrogens, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, and a host of other health pitfalls will also be addressed to ensure that each participant can protect and detoxify themselves from these safely and adequately.
the photos are very clear and the descriptions have been written by someone who has actually used the plants to the ends described therein (believe me, this is not the norm).
this is afree interview – call in to listen live at 10 a.m. est (9 a.m. cst & 8 a.m. pst).
pine pollen, given its potency, its similarity to ginseng in some of its actions, and its status as, perhaps,the premier phytoandrogen on the planet, should have been recognized long before now as the powerful medicinal it is.
timelapse the situation and it’s like we appeared only yesterday – instantaneously – in ever-changing form, on a particular planet.
thousands of chinese herbs have entered the western pharmacopoeia; the earliest and best known is perhaps ginseng.
because we will be teaching actual skills on the land, we must limit the class size in order to ensure that each student experiences an attentive learning environment.
p.p.s. i understand the many detrimental effects that alcoholism and alcohol related accidents have had on us as individuals and as a civilization.
but to a plant, death is laughable.
one of the great things about a plant like this, is there there is no concern of over harvest.
side with the plants, learn plants, eat plants, become plants – let food be your medicine, let medicine be your food – and begin to synthesize entirely different dimensions of time, technology, communication, and potential.
many wild foraged plants are eaten like vegetables (stinging nettle come to mind) but lack the energy density that we get from meats, grains, oils, concentrated sugars.
my close friendfrank giglio will be creating all of our meals throughout the weekend using the freshest local, organic, and wild-crafted ingredients.
i so look forward to sharing my knowledge on this ancient beverage at our workshop coming up in november!
that is all changing for me now that i have learned to forage a few key items, perhaps the greatest and most important, of which is wild rice.
for instance, methods for removing radioactive isotopes from our body fat, muscles and bones, pcb’s and other industrial chemicals from our lipid stores, and keeping genetically modified bio-pollutants out of our bodies will become as common place as removing plaque from your teeth or dirt from beneath your fingernails.
who knows what we have missed simply by not asking a plant what benefit it might have for mankind, rather than saying “tree, chop it and burn it for fire.”
they provide an exotic spiciness to any dish, from sweet to savory, and they come with the added percieved benefit of being from my own personal harvest.
from my perspective it’s a kind of plant artistry.
the dvd set is a compilation of hours, upon hours, of live footage from the weekend long event and includes tons of the latest health information and inspiration.
this is because of a curing process used with commercially prepared “wild rice” that causes the grains to become very hard and locks in some of the unpleasantly strong flavors.
and don’t forget to check out the mead making workshop that i have coming up next week.
from yet another direction, the “higher reflection” in a sense themother of raw, living diets, can be seen in the traditions and disciplines ofplant dietas.
in other words, those who can keep their bodies clean and detoxified, nourished and healthy, no matter what the level of contamination.
i love drinking it this way throughout the day, and like saving the older, dryer, and “harder” cider for the evenings with dinner and after.
with this in mind, i set forth exploring a raw food diet – with sharp eyes and a healthy aversion to dogma and definitions.
timelapse the situation and it’s like we appeared only yesterday – instantaneously – in ever-changing form, on a particular planet.
the surthriver understands the health challenges inherent in our modern world, and yet chooses to thrive despite them.
we really believe that stewardship of this ancient fire-craft is valuable for many reasons, not the least of which is the carrying on of what is one of our most ancient and fundamental human technologies.
i really believe there is such a lifestyle, and living it is so much more exciting and rewarding than the life that most of us were born to.
my experience has been that you can only truly feel the chronic congestion after you have cleared it.
i will be talking about everything from the “best foods available in the super-market” to the “ worst food that people are eating today“.
you can imagine that prior to the widespread use of refrigeration, areas of the world with large apple yields would have had quite a bit of cider on hand, as the juice of fresh apples ferments quite readily.
the film exposes the myths and mistruths that the diet-fad and processed food industries have perpetrated on a mis-educated populace for so many years.
“as we begin (once again) to naturalize ourselves – both nutritionally and medicinally – we may begin to discover that there is far more to a plant than just its chemical composition, more than just its list of constituent phyto-nutrients, vitamins and minerals.
i was immediately impressed with the way that these were built into the nutritional and spiritual systems of the area.
keep in mind that this practice, consuming clay and other earth compounds, is perhaps one of the oldest of all human behaviors.
if you are looking for a premier chaga extract you can find it at my company,surthrival.

check out this 12 minute video clip (click on the image below) of the talk i delivered in costa mesa last october titled, “developing sovereign health: the path of rewilding ourselves”.
watch the video above where i compare some of the features against other design-styles.
each of us is simply bringing forward the health strategy that has fueled our unique missions and passions, and each of us does this in our own unique style.
spending time witharthur haines has propelled my wild nutrition path forward in ways i am so grateful for.
also, special thanks to my friends at evolver for inviting me to be a part of thevisionary nutrition project, beginning on april 8th with my interview, where i will be teaching about the role of psychoactive plants in the human ecological and dietary niche.
ok, so of course maine hasn’t got any coconuts, but we do have something that tastes just as good – maybe better – and is just as nutritious.
this is the go-to book for understanding wild plants of the north east, and the one that will accompany me into the field this year and for years to come (mine is getting dog-eared already).
hour after hour i burned to know and meet the species who’s berry drupes splatter painted pink the otherwise indistinguishable wall of sub-tropic greenery that lined the  highway 75.
due to its status as florida’s floral-enemy-number-one, we can harvest its berries with a kind of impunity that is rarely experienced by the modern forager.
we have chosen the intimate class size to ensure that each of you gets the close personal attention you need, and to ensure that we don’t trample our wild foraging grounds.
we are friends first and foremost, and we know the value of love and laughter.
if this wasn’t enough, phyto-chemicals in nettle root further work to prevent benign prostate hyperplasia (bph) by stopping the binding of dht to the prostate membrane.
wolfe several years ago, during dieta with ayahuasca, the plants suggested to me that “ayahuasca would go best with raw food”.
the first wild food of the season!
the experience of harvesting the ingredients for the mead from my environment (honey, fruits, herbs, etc.)
essentially, plants can do whatever they want with humans, and with near-absolute impunity.
the last two weekend events we hosted in maine turned out to be game-changers for nearly everyone involved.
plants, i’ve found, often speak in terms of one’s present perception – in shapeshifting symbols that change as you follow them, conversations to discern and decipher.
nettle root is an herbal ally that seems almost designed to ensure the good health of a mans reproductive system into longevity (wives and girlfriends may want to take note).
they told me that i had until midnight to get something onto youtube, if i was to regain my honor.
this is going to be a very special weekend, featuring talks by botharthur haines and myself, as well as introductions to several earth based surthrival skills.
with this home-made clay or zeolite toothpaste, the goal is indeed to swallow it, moving it into the intestine where it can go to work mopping up industrial and nuclear debris that has bioaccumulated in our tissues.
our environment is changing faster than our minds can keep pace with, and this change is pressuring our biology to adapt at what are now nearly break neck speeds.
there are of course wonderful uses for chaga with its bark on as well, particularly as an anti-neoplastic medicine.
i promise if you give it just one week of consistent practice, not only will you easily master this skill, but you will have a life long practice that will contribute to your health and personal detoxification strategy.
these particles are constantly lodging in and congesting our upper respiratory tract, creating an environment for infection and/or being drawn still deeper into our lower respiratory tract (our lungs).
today our air is loaded with everything from dust (which is mostly dead skin cells) to heavy metals, from car exhaust to radioactive isoptopes.
eating well grown local food, drinking clean, fresh water, breathing clean and uncontaminated air, and receiving brilliant sunlight on our skin will once again become the norm, and again, this just might come about -for many at least- out of necessity before want.
it has been working very well for me, and it just might work for you too.

your readership is truly appreciated, ~daniel aug 02, 2011 | current projects, featured videos, wild food & water, written word | view comments how to make your own detoxifying toothpaste, and details on my annual trip to peru greetings friends, thanks for stopping by.
regardless, taking actions like these has put me at considerable ease about the radio-isotopes in our environment.
in the meantime, check out the video below to see the harvest and processing of these beautifully blush bunches of berries!
they can throw you down, clean you up, send you out to space, thrust you on a new paths, make you change your ways, whisper advice, keep you warm, dry, sheltered, alive, and in some cases, even kill you.
they will have to, as these things are rapidly destroying the integrity of our immune systems, our ability to reproduce, and even riddling our bodies with cancers.
many of us have taken our diets and nutrition into our own hands, though when it comes to personal health care, few of us have really stepped out and away from the entrenched medical system’s doctor/dentist treatment, and the role we play in it as “patient” (from the latin meaning “suffering”).
in the new orleans “jungleland” – behind climates of chaos and the media newsfeed, burnt cars and dead bodies are consumed by tall grass.
the fresh maple sap is so refreshing, so hydrating, and tastes so good that it is almost shocking that more people aren’t taking advantage of this delicious, abundant, and free late winter/early spring drink!

what an opportunity it is for me to spend three days with you amidst kripalu’s gorgeous spring settings, with its wonderful food and renowned staff.
though today much of the wild rice sold in the market place is cultivated in rice paddies, this highly nutritious grain is still available to the forager for the price of his or her labor.
either the pictures weren’t clear, the text wasn’t informative enough, the author was lacking real experience, or the book just wasn’t laid out in a user friendly way (ok, samuel thayer’s books are an exception to these criticisms, and are excellent wild food references).
