soils with organic material hold water better than those with more drainage material.light quality is the source of light energy, whether sun or artificial.over-watering is the number one cause of interior plant death.we need to know what conditions they needed in their natural habitat such as light, water, temperature and humidity and try to meet those requirements.re-potting plants need re-potting when they start to need water more frequently than normal, and when their roots encompass the soil in the pot, forming a heavy circle at the base of the plant.light requirements light is the most critical factor in growing interior plants successfully.sometimes a plant can grow in less intense light than recommended if it receives lower light for a longer time.we have covered the four major requirements (light, water, temperature, humidity) for plants but also key to interior plant success are fertilizing, soil, repotting and grooming.your goal is to get a well-balanced soil that holds water but allows for good drainage.all plants have a temperature range where they grow best.thick leaved plants – as a rule they require less frequent watering because of their ability to store water.the size of the plant – a 4-inch plant requires more frequent watering than the same 10-inch plant, which holds moisture longer.temperature – when the temperature is warmer, plants need more frequent watering.too frequent or too strong can damage or kill your plant.do not use native soil – because of possible pathogens and/or weeds.
