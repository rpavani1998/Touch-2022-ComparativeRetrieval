terra cotta is generally reliable, and breathes better, allowing some movement of air and water when the potting mix isn’t impacted, but they are very heavy and very breakable, and should only be handled by those that know how.using a lot of whizzbang nutrients is a great way of growing molds and fungi, and with a little effort a healthy crop of mysterious afflictions will keep you very busy and help keep your asthma and hay fever feeling appreciated.chic gardening invariably includes a range of pots which are probably better for attracting fungi and diseases than growing anything but excuses.you can slaughter all your plants by weakening a pot plant to the extent it gets a disease and passes it on to the others.you eat a balanced diet of medications and occasionally something which might theoretically be digestible.they can also make small plants out of big plants, and do enough damage to make repotting a real problem.some pots are truly useless; the cheapo variety, thin black plastic, are genuinely dangerous for the plant.in gardening, this syndrome has branched out recklessly into chic gardening, the pursuit of novelty at any price.the formal styles are out of fashion these days, and one of the reasons for that is that they are unbelievably expensive, and require a technical expertise that few people either have or can afford.chic gardening takes advantage of both the marketing and the fact that anything old enough is usually considered “art”, however bloody awful it is.better quality pots are thicker, with a feel of real durability.virtually everything in a normal household can be lethal with a little effort.unless a major breakthrough in the construction of really intelligent flowerpots happens soon, pots have their limits.between modern sculptures, charming bric-a-brac and entirely forgettable odds and sods, the only thing that can be safely said is that it prevents cluttering up the garden with plants.the pitiful spectacle of a pot bound plant is so familiar and so obvious that i’m wary of mentioning it, but pots will kill plants as efficiently as neglect.
