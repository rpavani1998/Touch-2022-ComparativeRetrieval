the prevalence of imports, as well as many advances in produce-storage and preservation technology, results in seasonal fruits and vegetables being available throughout the year.consequently, organic produce could be subject to higher levels of insect infestation.this technology has allowed food scientists to create an array of foods which were inconceivable 50 years ago, and to improve on the way that they produce “older” foods.vegetables with cracks and crevices are more vulnerable to infestation, since these are areas for insects to become trapped or hide.food scientists have identified numerous microorganisms which can either serve as or help to create, enzymes (see below), vitamins (e.g. riboflavin, vitamin b12), flavorful chemicals (e.g.msg) and other items (e.g. xanthan gum, citric acid, yeast).in many cases, when left to dry properly, it has been demonstrated that contact with water is not detrimental.the long term cumulative effects of consuming gluten can be devastating for a celiac person.also, insects often develop immunity to certain pesticides over time.in addition, scientists have learnt new ways to react chemicals with one another (and use other methods) to create emulsifiers, acidulants, sweeteners, flavors and other chemicals (e.g. polysorbates, ascorbic acid, aspartame, esters, magnesium citrate).a significant number of people that suffer from gluten related conditions, jewish and non jewish, take advantage of the many gluten free products available forpesach .however, allergies can be life threatening.thus, every time a person with celiac consumes gluten, the small intestines are damaged.these microorganisms, to do the work they have to do,must have carbohydrate sources, and often the source of choice is…glucose.although, farmers might use pesticides to curb insect infestation levels, the effects are often limited.an allergic person exposed to an allergen could experience an anaphylactic shock and stop breathing.
