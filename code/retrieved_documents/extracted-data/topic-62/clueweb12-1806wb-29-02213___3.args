here's a link to their website where they have lots of pics & care tips: http://kerrys.com/products/?subcat=10&temp=6 "my body is a temple - unfortunately, it's a fixer-upper.
these plants were given as memorials to my sister so i'm hoping to be able to keep them around.
like bg, a north window and moderately moist soil works for peace lilies and orchids--i have one large and 2 small phals that are plump-leaved and producing new roots and leaves, plus a variegated peace lily putting out new leaves.
they're lovely easy plants - a perfect beginner's orchid.

the only pest i've ever had a problem with is mealybug, which seems to arrive on every orchid i've purchased or received.
orchid plants roots need to breathe.
wipe excess water, with a paper folded paper towel.
and as also stated, terracotta orchid pots with the little slits in the sides are best for good drainage & aeration.

depending on the orchid type, high humidity isn't always necessary, & more orchids die from overwatering than underwatering - particularly those with aerial root systems grown in a bark medium.
those made for potpouri or votive candles work great for small orchids (i managed to find several dirt cheap at a thrift shop).
do not over-fertilize this orchid.
they're put out by a fl company called kerry's.
the best thing i've found so far for the pitiful ones rescued off the sales rack are decorative pots with lots of holes.
if that pot it is in has a plastic pot inside i would take off the outer pot.
from a google search for peace lily, i gather that they pretty much thrive on neglect?

posted june 25, 2011 04:31 pm hide post i had a peace lily for years and neglect pretty well describes what it got.
all of my orchids (phals, mini-cymbidiums, & occs) are in an east-facing window over my kitchen sink.
i'd find it wilted and draped over the pot, down to the floor.
i get good foliage growth & extremely frequent blooms at this exposure.

however, my screened porch is east-facing and shaded so maybe i'll put them out there for the summer and figure out what to do with them in the fall.

i've never owned either of these plants so i'm needing to learn about their care.

so it can get fully doused and enjoy the steam and humidity.
this way you can water your plant, anytime of the day/night.
used as directed, & clipping off the bloom stems once they wither, can have your orchid blooming almost continuously.
i'd find it wilted and draped over the pot, down to the floor.
but if i were you, i'd consider that these orchids are true tropicals, & ice-cold melting water isn't really optimum.
although i don't know how "organic" it is, i also use a fertilizer specifically meant for orchids.
plain old luke-warm water is still the best.

hide post claude, i'll look for one of those orchid pots.
pm hide post a window facing a partial sun might do.

this one is in a plastic pot inside the ceramic one.
hide post north-facing exposures do not work for me, nor did i say they did.
the pretty outside pot looks good but does nothing to improve the health of your flower.
as stated on other posts - well-draining orchid medium is best, which usually consists mostly of shredded bark.

they burn easily in hot bright situations.
a good watering and it was perky within a couple of hours.
a friend stopped by today and told me she has orchids like mine and waters them by putting three ice cubes on the soil once a week.
soil kept just moist works best; overwatering will yellow & rot them.
the pretty outside pot looks good but does nothing to improve the health of your flower.
a few applications of safer insecticidal soap keeps things under control.
1/4 strength will do ok, in the growing season

1/4 strength will do ok, in the growing season use porous orchid mix; then you can water/fertilize with about 80 degree warm water, any time of the day, during the growing season.

bright indirect light is best - mine are on an east-facing windowsill above the kitchen sink.
keep a pot of "catnip" nearby to deter your cats.
special orchid clay pots have holes and slits all around the pot.

so if it's indoors, water and/or mist it frequently.
i lost all my big orchid plants recently and am down to one phaelenopsis which has yet to bloom, but looks nice and healthy.
do not over-fertilize this orchid.
