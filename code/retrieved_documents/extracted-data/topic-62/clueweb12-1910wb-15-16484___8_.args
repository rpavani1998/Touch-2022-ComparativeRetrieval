by moving pots around and positioning them not directly over the flame, i can still do slow cooking over the high btu flame when necessary.cooking on a gas stove top is like playing a musical instrument.but it's also a threat to job security to the rookie line cook who thinks he has heated the stoves in preparation for a day of cooking and upon his return finds them cold when he needs to use them.besides the old furnace in the basement, we had smaller gas stoves in the other rooms, especially in the upstairs apartment where i lived.changing gas bottles on a hot grill is also dangerous.it's dangerous for the obvious reason that you don't want gas filling a kitchen.while i'm not crazy about heating with gas, i've actually cooked on it many times in my life.we decided to install gas because it didn't add a lot of extra expense to the remodeling job.harrold said many of his students have never cooked with gas before starting the program, but soon come to love the predictability of gas.it makes timing a meal so much easier.there are new ceramic cook tops, but i am afraid of scratching them, as i can get a little rough and clumsy when i have four pots going at once.when the winter winds blew hard and in the right direction, it would blow out the flames from some of jets, leaving them exposed to ooze unignited natural gas into the apartment's entryway.well, almost always; there was the time on my sister-in-law's birthday when i ran out in the middle of cooking and found myself with two empty tanks.by the time i'm ready to cook, so is the water.the new magnetic surfaces are space age, but i don't want to have to buy special pots.
