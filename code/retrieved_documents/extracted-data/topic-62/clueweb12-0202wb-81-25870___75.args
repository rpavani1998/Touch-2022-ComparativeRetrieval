the hurds can absorb up to five times their weight in moisture (typically 50% higher than wood shavings), do not produce dust (following initial dust removal), and are easily composted.
narcotic strains tend to be more attractive in odor than fiber strains, and because they produce much higher numbers of flowers than fiber strains, and the (female) floral parts provide most of the essential oil, narcotic strains are naturally adapted to essential oil production.
as pointed out later, higher yield and better harvesting practices may make whole hempseed an economical livestock feed.

cultural and production costs of hemp have been said to be comparable to those for corn, and while the truth of this remains to be confirmed, the legislative burden that accompanies hemp puts the crop at a unique disadvantage.
bioremediation preliminary work in germany (noted in karus and leson 1994) suggested that hemp could be grown on soils contaminated with heavy metals, while the fiber remained virtually free of the metals.
the myth that hemp is a wonder crop that can be grown on any soil led some to cultivate on soils with a history of producing poor crops; of course, a poor crop was the result.
dewey (1914) gave the following information: “the short oil-seed hemp with slender stems, about 30 inches high, bearing compact clusters of seeds and maturing in 60 to 90 days, is of little value for fiber production, but the experimental plants, grown from seed imported from russia, indicate that it may be valuable as an oil-seed crop to be harvested and threshed in the same manner as oil-seed flax.”

an absence of such fiber-strain traits as tallness, limited branching, long internodes, and very hollow stems, is characteristic of narcotic strains.
because hemp is regaining its ancient status as an important crop, a number of private germplasm collections have been assembled for the breeding of cultivars as commercial ventures (de meijer and van soest 1992; de meijer 1998), and of course these are available only on a restricted basis, if at all.
supporters of the hemp legalization effort claim hemp cultivation could be profitable for us farmers.
wheat straw is the dominant nonwood fiber in such applications.
in any event, the core fibers, have found a variety of uses, as detailed below.

a thc concentration in marijuana of approximately 0.9% has been suggested as a practical minimum level to achieve the (illegal) intoxicant effect, but cbd (the predominant cannabinoid of fiber and oilseed varieties) antagonizes (i.e. reduces) the effects of thc (grotenhermen and karus 1998).
hempseed oil has been classified as a semi-drying oil, like soybean oil, and is therefore more suited to edible than industrial oil purposes.
however, the short, bulky fibers found in the inner part of the plant (hurds) can also be used to make cheaper grades of paper, apparently without greatly affecting quality of the printing surface.

for edible purposes, hempseed oil is extracted by cold pressing.
dewey (1914) noted that a turkish narcotic type of land race called smyrna was commonly used in the early 20th century in the us to produce birdseed, because (like most narcotic types of cannabis) it is densely branched, producing many flowers, hence seeds.
industrial fluids the vegetable oils have been classified by “iodine value” as drying (120–200), semi-drying (100–120), and non-drying (80–100), which is determined by the degree of saturation of the fatty acids present (raie et al. 1995).

in contrast to shorter-chain and more saturated fatty acids, these essential fatty acids do not serve as energy sources, but as raw materials for cell structure and as precursors for biosynthesis for many of the body’s regulatory biochemicals.
most insects cause only limited damage to hemp, and substantial insect damage is uncommon, so the use of insecticides is very rarely required.

for example, the widespread current use of plastic netting to reinforce grass sod is quite objectionable, the plastic persisting for many years and interfering with lawn care.
a chief argument that has been advanced in favor of developing hemp as a paper and pulp source has been that as a non-wood or tree-free fiber source, it can reduce harvesting of primary forests and the threat to associated biodiversity.
of course, all other types of transportation vehicles from bicycles to airplanes might make use of such technology.
unlike flax, hemp long fiber requires water retting for preparation of high-quality spinnable fibers for production of fine textiles.

it was estimated that 8.7 million marijuana plants were harvested in 1997, worth $15.1 billion to growers and $25.2 billion on the retail market (the wholesale value was used to compare marijuana to other cash crops).
although it might seem that hemp bast fibers are desirable in composite wood products because of their length and strength, in fact the short fibers of the hurds have been found to produce a superior product (k. domier, pers.
increasing limitation of cheap labor for traditional production in europe and the new world led to the creation of some mechanical inventions, but too late to counter growing interest in competitive crops.
this is anonymously-authored, therefore presumably represents a corporate or “official” evaluation.

still another consideration is the green ideal of producing locally for local needs; by this credo, hemp is preferable in temperate regions to the use of tropical fibers, which need to be imported.
the two portions of stem are separated in this photograph, and are joined by the tough bark fibers.
the core fibers are generally considered too short for high grade paper applications (a length of 3 mm is considered ideal), and too much lignin is present.
in traditional hemp processing, the long fiber was separated from the internal woody hurds in two steps, breaking (stalks were crushed under rollers that broke the woody core into short pieces, some of which were separated) and scutching (the remaining hurds, short fibers (“tow”) and long fibers (“line fiber, ” “long-line fiber”) were separated).
natural fibers have considerable advantages for use in conveyance (karus et al. 2000): low density and weight reduction, favorable mechanical, acoustical, and processing properties (including low wear on tools), no splintering in accidents, occupational health benefits (compared to glass fibers), no off-gassing of toxic compounds, and price advantages.

marijuana was judged to be the largest revenue producing crop in alabama, california, colorado, hawaii, kentucky, maine, rhode island, tennessee, virginia, and west virginia, and one of the top five cash crops in 29 other states.
fiber production should also be governed by availability of moisture throughout the season, and the need for high humidity in the late summer and fall for retting, so that large areas of the interior and west of north america are not adapted to growing fiber hemp.
hemp cigarette paper, the most profitable paper product currently manufactured from hemp.
still another important advantage is the precise control over production quantities and schedule that is possible with annual crops.
as noted above, the oilcake remaining after oil is expressed from the seeds is a very nutritious feed supplement for livestock, but it can also be used for production of a high-protein flour.
canada is specialized on oilseed production and processing, so that hemp oil and grain are much more suitable than fiber.
unless the producer participates in sharing of value-added income, large profits are unlikely.
and, directly or indirectly, the lumber/paper industry receives subsidies and/or supports, which is most unlikely for hemp.
waste straw is widely available from cereals and other crops, and although generally not nearly as desirable as hemp, can produce bulk pulp far more cheaply than can be made from hemp.
uncertainty about longrun demand for hemp products and the potential for oversupply discounts the prospects for hemp as an economically viable alternative crop for american farmers.
as noted above, a level of about 1% thc is considered the threshold for marijuana to have intoxicating potential, so the 0.3% level is conservative, and some countries (e.g. parts of australia, switzerland) have permitted the cultivation of cultivars with higher levels.
essential oil of different strains varies considerably in odor, and this may have economic importance in imparting a scent to cosmetics, shampoos, soaps, creams, oils, perfumes, and foodstuffs.
in the netherlands, the annual value of narcotic hemp cultivation (ca.
in thermoplastic production, natural fibers are blended with polypropylene fibers and formed into a mat, which is pressed under heat into the desired form.
yields are very small—about 10 l/ha (mediavilla and steinemann 1997), so essential oil ofc. sativa is expensive, and today is simply a novelty.
doubtless in the unlikely event that it became possible, many would grow hemp as an ornamental.
table 3 shows the “economic significance” (dollars generated in the black market plus dollar cost of control measures) of the illicit drug industry associated withc. sativa, and contrasts this with the estimated dollar value of major categories of legitimate uses.
essential oil of different strains varies considerably in odor, and this may have economic importance in imparting a scent to cosmetics, shampoos, soaps, creams, oils, perfumes, and foodstuffs.
such appears to be unsurpassed for horse bedding, and also make an excellent litter for cats and other pets (fig.
it was estimated that 8.7 million marijuana plants were harvested in 1997, worth $15.1 billion to growers and $25.2 billion on the retail market (the wholesale value was used to compare marijuana to other cash crops).
small crops have been harvested with sickle-bar mowers and hay swathers, but plugging of equipment is a constant problem.
improved microorganisms or enzymes could augment or replace traditional water retting.
the second breeding goal is for larger seeds, as these are more easily shelled.
bottom right: some recent oilseed cultivars are grown at moderate density and are short and relatively unbranched.
evaluating interference of thc in hemp food produces with employee drug testing.
in 1999 over 20,000 t of natural fiber were used for these purposes in europe, including about, 2,000 t of hemp.
transportation costs are also very much higher for hemp stalks than for wood chips.
the high degree of unsaturation is responsible for the extreme sensitivity to oxidative rancidity.
in addition to textiles used in clothing, coarser woven cloth (canvas) is used for upholstery, bags, sacks, and tarpaulins.
van roekel (1994) has pointed out that egyptian papyrus sheets are not paper, because the fiber strands are woven, not wet-laid; the oldest surviving paper is over 2,000 years of age, from china, and was made from hemp fiber (fleming and clarke 1998).
the equipment for this is rare in north america, and consequently use of domestically-produced fiber for high quality textile applications is extremely limited.
given these current demands for research on medicinal marijuana, it will be necessary to produce crops of drug types ofc. sativa.
however, feeding entire plants is another matter, because the leaves are covered with the resin-producing glands.
it is well known in the illicit trade how to screen off the more potent fractions of the plant in order to increase thc levels in resultant drug products.
ageing and pathology (diabetes, hypertension, etc.) may impair gla metabolism, making supplementation desirable.
hemp was often grown on farms with marginal incomes in the hopes that it was a savior from a downward financial spiral.
whilec. sativa has been used as a euphoriant in india, the near east, parts of africa, and other old world areas for thousands of years, such use simply did not develop in temperate countries where hemp was raised.
putting tall whole plants through a conventional combine results in the straw winding around moving parts, and the fibers working into bearings, causing breakdown, fires, high maintenance, and frustration.
spun, loosely compacted hemp insulation.
cultural and production costs of hemp have been said to be comparable to those for corn, and while the truth of this remains to be confirmed, the legislative burden that accompanies hemp puts the crop at a unique disadvantage.
while the narcotics image ofc. sativa is often disadvantageous, advertisers who choose to play up this association do so knowing that it will attract a segment of the consuming population.
additionally, the general attitude towards cannabis, in which it is seen only as a drug of abuse and addiction, has not helped.
the primary bast fibers in the bark are 540 mm long, and are amalgamated in fiber bundles which can be 15 m long (secondary bast fibers are about 2 mm long).
hemp seeds contain 25%30% protein, with a reasonably complete amino acid spectrum.
hemp is plagued by bird predation, which take a heavy toll on seed production.
as history has demonstrated, unbridled enthusiasm for largely untested new crops touted as gold mines sometimes leads to disaster.
in the early 1980s in minnesota, jerusalem artichoke was touted as a fuel, a feed, a food, and a sugar crop.
cannabinoids are produced in specialized epidermal glands, which differ notably in distribution on different organs of the plant (high concentrations occur on the upper surface of the young leaves and young twigs, on the tepals, stamens, and especially on the perigonal bract).
the us drug enforcement administration published new regulations on hemp in the federal register on october 9th 2001 that in effect 4 months later would ban the food use of hemp in the us because any amount of thc would be unacceptable in
most hemp oilseed in europe is currently obtained from so-called dual usage plants (employed for harvest of both stem fiber and seeds, from the same plants).
the species problem in cannabis, science and semantics.
the characteristics of hemp fibers have proven to be superior for production of molded composites.
hemp is a bast fiber crop, i.e. the most desirable (long) fibers are found in the phloem-associated tissues external to the phloem, just under the bark.
the long, lignin-poor bast fibers also have considerable potential to be used in many non-paper, non-textile applications, as noted below.
“seeds” (achenes) of hemp, with a match for scale.
and, directly or indirectly, the lumber/paper industry receives subsidies and/or supports, which is most unlikely for hemp.
sterols in the seeds probably serve the same function, and like the tocopherols are also desirable from a human health viewpoint.
drug varieties have been observed to produce more than a kilogram of seed per plant, so that a target yield of several tonnes per hectare is conceivable (watson and clarke 1997).
‘mindboggling’ marijuana crop tops 800 tonnes.
indeed, the reason hemp cultivation was made illegal in north america was concern that the hemp crop was a drug menace.
this is dioecious, short (about a meter in height), highly branched, with large leaves (i.e. wide leaflets), and it is slow to mature.
as noted above, a level of about 1% thc is considered the threshold for marijuana to have intoxicating potential, so the 0.3% level is conservative, and some countries (e.g. parts of australia, switzerland) have permitted the cultivation of cultivars with higher levels.
an average mature plant was estimated to produce 170 g of “marketable substance.”
economies of scale are such that the supply of hemp is minute compared to the supply of wood fiber.
as noted above, the oilcake remaining after oil is expressed from the seeds is a very nutritious feed supplement for livestock, but it can also be used for production of a high-protein flour.
hemp paper is useful for specialty applications such as currency and cigarette papers where strength is needed.
as well, the sticky leaves of hemp were thought to trap pollen.
accordingly, europe is far more advanced in hemp development with respect to all fiber-based applications than other parts of the world.
it is important to understand, therefore, that the quality of modern hemp seed for human consumption far exceeds anything produced historically.
natural fibers in automobile composites are used primarily in press-molded parts (fig. 18).
the reader is warned that this book, as well as almost all of the literature on hemp, is very much more concerned with fiber production than oilseed production.
although the protein content is smaller than that of soybean, it is much higher than in grains like wheat, rye, maize, oat, and barley.
noting the oversupply of hempseeds associated with canadas 12,000 ha in 1999, the report concluded that the long term demand for hemp products is uncertain, and predicts that the hemp market in the us will likely remain small and limited.
cement (concrete) and plaster.

the seeds are well known to provide extremely nutritious food for both wild birds and domestic fowl.
good coating materials prepared from vegetable oil depend on the nature and number of double bonds present in the fatty acids.
in canada, every acquisition of hemp grown at a particular place and time must be tested for thc content by an independent laboratory and, under the industrial hemp regulations, fields of hemp with more than 0.3% thc may require destruction (a slight degree of flexibility is generally exercised).
a principal limitation is climaticthe local environment should be suitably but not excessively moist at the close of the harvest season.
the composition of hemp seed oil and its potential as an important source of nutrition.
there is anecdotal evidence that cannabis drugs are useful for: alleviating nausea, vomiting, and anorexia following radiation therapy and chemotherapy; as an appetite stimulant for aids patients; for relieving the tremors of multiple sclerosis and epilepsy; and for pain relief, glaucoma, asthma, and other ailments [see mechoulam and hanus (1997) for an authoritative medical review, and pate (1995) for a guide to the medical literature].
increasing limitation of cheap labor for traditional production in europe and the new world led to the creation of some mechanical inventions, but too late to counter growing interest in competitive crops.
cannabinoids are produced in specialized epidermal glands, which differ notably in distribution on different organs of the plant (high concentrations occur on the upper surface of the young leaves and young twigs, on the tepals, stamens, and especially on the perigonal bract).
hemp seeds contain virtually no thc, but thc contamination results from contact of the seeds with the resin secreted by the epidermal glands on the leaves and floral parts, and also by the failure to sift away all of the bracts (which have the highest concentration of thc of any parts of the plant) that cover the seeds.
fiber production should also be governed by availability of moisture throughout the season, and the need for high humidity in the late summer and fall for retting, so that large areas of the interior and west of north america are not adapted to growing fiber hemp.
selection for fiber has resulted in strains that have much more bark fiber tissues and much less woody core than encountered in narcotic strains, oilseed strains, and wild plants (fig. 12).
analysis of the profitability of hemp cultivation for paper.
the composition of extracted essential oil is quite different from the volatiles released around the fresh plant (particularly limonene and alpha-pinene), so that a pleasant odor of the living plant is not necessarily indicative of a pleasant-smelling essential oil.

by contrast, drug varieties have been selected for very high yield of flowers, and accordingly produce very high yield of seeds.
the resulting material can be poured like concrete, but has a texture vaguely reminiscent of cork—much lighter than cement, and with better heat and sound-insulating properties.
however, this analysis does not do justice to the developing hemp geotextile market.
the second major concern is that legalizing hemp production may mean the de facto legalization of marijuana cultivation.
more than a ton of marijuana was prepared for experimental research (described in small et al. 1975).
hemp seed is often found canned or vacuum-packed (fig. 35).
hemp fiber can potentially replace other biological fibers in many applications, but also, as noted below, can sometimes compete with minerals such as glass fiber and steel.
because of the similarities of flax and hemp, the technologies developed for one usually are adaptable to the other.
because hemp hurds are a costly product, it is likely that animal bedding will remain the most important application.
both in canada and the us, the most critical problem to be addressed for commercial exploitation ofc. sativa is the possible unauthorized drug use of the plant.
growing short varieties dedicated to grain production eliminates many of the above problems, and since the profitability of hemp straw is limited at present, seems preferable.

steam sterilization of the seeds, often required by law, allows air to penetrate and so stimulates rancidity.
both woven and non-woven fibers can be applied to geotextiles; woven and knitted materials are stronger and the open structure may be advantageous (e.g. in allowing plants to grow through), but non-wovens are cheaper and better at suppressing weeds.
in addition, it has been suggested that other components, including trace amounts of terpenes and cannabinoids, could have health benefits (leizer et al. 2000).

thermal insulation products (fig. 20, 21) are the third most important sector of the hemp industry of the eu.
hemp particularly requires good nitrogen fertilization, more so for seed production than fiber.
however, as described above relatively crude fiber preparations also have applications.
the profitability of the illegal crop is indicated by a comparison of the cost of a bushel of corn (roughly $2.50) and a bushel of manicured marijuana (about $70,000; it has been suggested that prices range from $500 a pound, for low-quality marijuana, to more than $5,000 a pound for boutique strains like northern lights and afghan kush).
although it might seem that hemp bast fibers are desirable in composite wood products because of their length and strength, in fact the short fibers of the hurds have been found to produce a superior product (k. domier, pers.
the high and rather inpenetrable hedge that hemp can produce was considered unsurpassed by any other species for the purpose.
retting in tanks rather than in open bodies of water is a way of controlling the effluents while taking advantage of the high-quality fiber that is produced.
in 1999, the eu produced about 27,000 t of hemp fiber, but only about 6,200 t of hemp seeds, mostly in france, and 90% of this was used as animal feed (karus et al. 2000).
the world market for hemp essential oil is very limited at present, and probably also has limited growth potential.
the characteristic odor of the plant is due to the abundant terpenes, which are not psychoactive.
the most important specialty pulp products made from hemp are cigarette paper (fig. 16), bank notes, technical filters, and hygiene products.

in addition to agricultural wastes, there are vast quantities of scrub trees, especially poplar, in northern areas, that can supply large amounts of low-quality wood fiber extremely cheaply.
it is a combination of prospective economic benefit coupled with assurance that hemp cultivation will not detrimentally affect the enforcement of marijuana legislation that has led most industrially advanced countries to reverse prohibitions against growing hemp.
cbn andd8-thc are considered to be degradation products or analytical artifacts (pate 1998a).
it might also be said that those who have entered the hemp industry have tended to be very highly motivated, resourceful, and industrious, qualities that have been needed in the face of rather formidable obstacles to progress.
another chief advantage of several annual fiber crops over forestry crops is relative productivity, annual fiber crops sometimes producing of the order of four times as much per unit of land.

bottom: demonstration of installation of blanket, near la rivière, manitoba.
it would seem unwise to grow hemp as an oilseed on contaminated soils, but such a habitat might be suitable for a fiber or biomass crop.
because hemp is regaining its ancient status as an important crop, a number of private germplasm collections have been assembled for the breeding of cultivars as commercial ventures (de meijer and van soest 1992; de meijer 1998), and of course these are available only on a restricted basis, if at all.

wild north american plants have undergone many generations of natural adaptation to local conditions of climate, soil and pests, and accordingly it is safe to conclude that they harbor genes that are invaluable for the improvement of hemp cultivars.
hemp in our opinion is particularly suited to be developed as an oilseed crop in north america.
natural fibers have considerable advantages for use in conveyance (karus et al. 2000): low density and weight reduction, favorable mechanical, acoustical, and processing properties (including low wear on tools), no splintering in accidents, occupational health benefits (compared to glass fibers), no off-gassing of toxic compounds, and price advantages.

but marketing based on the healthful and tasteful properties of hemp food products, the durable nature of hemp textiles, and the environmental advantages of the crop has proven to be widely acceptable, and is likely to promote the long term development of hemp industries.
practically, this has meant in canadian experience that a few cultivars have been eliminated from further commercial cultivation because they sometimes exceed the 0.3% level (fedora 19 and futura, authorized in 2000, have now been removed because some test results in several years exceeded 0.3%; finola and uniko b are under probation because of elevated levels), but on the whole most of the permitted cultivars have maintained highly consistent development of quite low levels of thc.
in canada, extraordinary yields of 1.5 t/ha have been realized, at least locally, although in the initial years of hempseed development in canada yields were often less than 500 kg/ha.
as detailed below, the development of hemp as a new legal crop in north america must be considered in relation to illicit cultivation, so it is important to appreciate the scope of the drug situation.
bottles of hemp fragrance (left) and essential oil (center), and pastilles flavored with hemp essential oil (right).
however, essential oil in the marketplace has often been produced from low-thccannabis, and the thc content of essential oil obtained by steam distillation can be quite low, producing a product satisfying the needs for very low thc levels in food and other commercial goods.
the high degree of unsaturation is responsible for the extreme sensitivity to oxidative rancidity.

dewey (1914) gave the following information: the short oil-seed hemp with slender stems, about 30 inches high, bearing compact clusters of seeds and maturing in 60 to 90 days, is of little value for fiber production, but the experimental plants, grown from seed imported from russia, indicate that it may be valuable as an oil-seed crop to be harvested and threshed in the same manner as oil-seed flax.
from the individual producers perspective, the old adage find your market before you plant your seed remains sound advice.
wild female hemp plant collected oct. 17, 2000 near ottawa, canada.
narcotic strains tend to be more attractive in odor than fiber strains, and because they produce much higher numbers of flowers than fiber strains, and the (female) floral parts provide most of the essential oil, narcotic strains are naturally adapted to essential oil production.
while small, secretory, resin-producing glands occur on the epidermis of most of the above-ground parts of the plant, the glands are very dense and productive on the perigonal bracts, which are accordingly of central interest in marijuana varieties.
