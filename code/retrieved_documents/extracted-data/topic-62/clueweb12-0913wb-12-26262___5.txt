in an oval cooker you can more easily fit a whole chicken or odd-shaped pieces of meat like lamb shanks than in a round pot.
a few mouse clicks and two days  later i was making my first slow cooked pot roast.
like onions and garlic, or blooming spices on  the stove top first.
after making three dishes in my very pretty crock pot, i began to notice how recipes that were supposed to take six to eight hours on "low" were in fact cooking in three and i called rival for advice.
here's  what i've already come to appreciate about having a slow cooker: while we can use our stovetops and ovens for braising, or a long, slow  roast at a low temperature, only the slow cooker gives us such gentle heat,  delivered through convection.
the second volume was written specifically for home cooks with smaller households using smaller cookers.
once you turn it on, the metal outside gets very  hot, enough to burn your hand so the pot needs to be placed where children (or  adults) won't brush against it during these day-long simmerings.
they're perfect for winter meals and useful year-round.
back to that in a moment.
slow cookers can cost as little as about $12 and rise to more than $200 (all-clad's deluxe slow cooker sells at williams-sonoma for $249.95).
buying a slow cooker rival is the king of  slow cookers.

what can't a slow cooker do?
while there are about a dozen slow cooker manufacturers,  rival is in the business in a serious way and they're the dominant brand.
for example, "corn chowder with  jalapeño," "barbecued pork ribs," "vegetable  tagine," "slow-roasted beets with walnut gremolata," and  "chocolate pudding cake.
i can cook a slow braise without heating up my entire apartment from  having the oven on for three hours.
but buying one a quart or so larger didn't seem to  change the price and i wanted its versatility.
many of the newer models,  including the one i bought, let you set the heat level (low or high) as well as  a multi-hour timer calibrated at 30-minute intervals.
so if we can cook the same way with our stoves, why use a slow cooker -- especially in our small city kitchens that don't have room for non-essential appliances?
the first is subtitled, "simple and  sophisticated meals from around the world" and volume ii is "regional  comfort food classics."
so what does the slow  cooker do that your oven cannot?
its  80 recipes are very appealing.
if you want to start a recipe in the  morning and leave it cooking while you head off to work for 8 or so hours, you  still have to do some cooking and prepping to get it going.
if you want to start a recipe in the morning and leave it cooking while you head off to work for 8 or so hours, you still have to do some cooking and prepping to get it going.
one veal stew recipe i tried called for a half-cup of flour for about 3 pounds of veal.
regardless of the meat or poultry and no matter how much flour was  used, every time i tried this method the result was unpleasantly gummy.
the $7 a meal slow  cooker cookbookby linda larsen (adams media, paperback, no  photographs, $9.95) has 301 recipes and was written by a "pillsbury  bake-off recipe tester."
chili, soup,  and maybe pot roast, recipes in which ingredients would just be thrown together  and essentially abandoned for eight hours.
it's  not clear if it's a big stick or a little stick and if you don't have a spice  grinder, you're left to your own calculation as to how to substitute powdered  cinnamon.
five days later ups delivered me a brand new crockpot, plus it was a newer model!
but you may still be disappointed with the result if too many  corners are cut.
so add a little french technique to the all american slow  cooker.
the second  volume was written specifically for home cooks with smaller households using  smaller cookers.
for example, the least expensive models are completely  manual with a knob that simply chooses low, high, or off.
these recipes sometimes use processed ingredients  like canned soups, jarred salsa and frozen french fry potatoes.
none of them let you pre-set the start because this would create  a food hazard with raw food, notably meat, poultry or fish, sitting at room  temperature and developing bacteria.
this condensation is a sign that it's working right.
for example, "corn chowder with jalapeño," "barbecued pork ribs," "vegetable tagine," "slow-roasted beets with walnut gremolata," and "chocolate pudding cake."
it was motivating to have my premiere dish be such a success.
temperatures are lower than what we usually use in our ovens; about 185° f  to 200° f when low, and 250° f to 300° f at high.
hensperger are both excellent choices for their recipe diversity and also the  tips and instructions throughout the books.
two-to-three-quart models are available for smaller households but the most popular sizes are five to six quarts.
a favorite feature is a chart that details the basic preparation, precooking and slow cook time (both at low and high) for about 50 mainstream ingredients.
these volumes inspired me to cook the  more complex and sophisticated recipes and not fall back to easy stews or  soups.
and the most costly cookers have extras; all-clad's deluxe model has an insert made of cast aluminum that can be used on a stove top.
it may sound fancy but  in fact is very easy -- plus it lets you control the result.
this pre-cooking also helps kill any bacteria that may be on the surface of the food.
without much of a  detour i quickly reached a human being, a lovely woman named "tanya"  who patiently listened to my virgin crock pot experiences.
i worked with six slow cooker cookbooks.

so what does the slow cooker do that your oven cannot?
that is why most slow cooker recipes begin with browning in a skillet plus pre-cooking some of the ingredients that will develop better flavor if you get them a head start with more heat.
the metal casing surrounds the ceramic container  -- the "crock" -- and the cover keeps the moisture inside the cooker.
the difference in price is primarily due to size or electric features.
in each of these six cookbooks, nearly every recipe for a stew or braise says to toss the meat or poultry in flour before browning, sometimes adding even more flour to the mixture before the slow cooking begins.
soon after you turn on the cooker you'll see the glass cover will steam  up.
the publisher has been  generous in giving us permission to reprint both recipes.

yes, the cooker will be on for six or seven  hours (three or four if i set it to high)
i also liked their  "italian white beans with pancetta," a recipe that confirmed how  dried beans are a perfect match for slow cookers.
that's a lot of flour.
i experimented and instead of using the authors' coat-with-flour-at-the-start method, i used a technique i learned in culinary school that will let you get that gravy you want, but without the gumminess or lumps.
i bought a 5 1/2-quart not because i have  a big household; i don't.
you can't brown in one.
as andrew  schloss, author of the wonderfulart of the slow cooker, wrote,  "in cooking, brown is not just a color.

if you want to use a slow cooker in its most iconic way -- meaning setting  it before you leave for work so that you can come home to a pot of white bean  and lamb stew -- practice a few times first by making recipes and watching the  progress closely while you're still at home.
i began at the major recipe web sites and found that allrecipes  was particularly useful, probably because this database is filled with recipes  submitted by home cooks, especially ones from across the heartland where slow  cookers aren't as exotic as they are in city kitchens.
bed, bath & beyond's web site had a 5 1/2 quart rival crockpot with a timer and automatic thermostat that would turn to warm when the cooking was done.
the technique of slow cooking i always considered slow cookers as good for only a few dishes.

plus if i'm going to use 6 or so hours of electricity to cook something and go through all the effort to prep the ingredients, i want to get my money and effort's worth, meaning leftovers.
others have an option for "warm" after the cooking is done.
but nonetheless, the recipes are mostly easy, many are appealing, and once you get the hang of your cooker, you can easily make fresh substitutions for the canned or frozen stuff.
same for every other spice -- cumin seed, fennel seed, whole cloves,  etc.
[remember this  method when you want to make thanksgiving gravy with turkey stock.]
i figured they knew what they were doing.
in terms of functionality, all slow cookers are essentially the same and employ the same technology.
after the time has  passed, the cooker will automatically shift to "warm" and keep it  there for up to four hours.

one veal stew recipe i  tried called for a half-cup of flour for about 3 pounds of veal.
