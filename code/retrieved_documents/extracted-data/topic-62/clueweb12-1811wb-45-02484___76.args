grain growers should be aware that flocks of voracious birds are a considerable source of damage to hempseed, particularly in small plantations.
however, the short, bulky fibers found in the inner part of the plant (hurds) can also be used to make cheaper grades of paper, apparently without greatly affecting quality of the printing surface.
hemp paper is typically made only from bast fibers, which require separation from the hurds, thereby increasing costs.
the pulp and paper industry based on wood has considered the use of hemp for pulp, but only on an experimental basis.

the foundations, walls, floors, and ceilings of houses have been made using hemp hurds mixed with natural lime and water.
the hundreds of seed collections acquired for small’s studies (reviewed in small 1979) were destroyed in 1980 because canadian government policy at that time envisioned no possibility that hemp would ever be developed as a legitimate crop.

it was estimated that 8.7 million marijuana plants were harvested in 1997, worth $15.1 billion to growers and $25.2 billion on the retail market (the wholesale value was used to compare marijuana to other cash crops).
should the us permit commercial hemp cultivation to resume, it will likely be for the same reasons.
the seeds (fig. 33) have traditionally been employed as bird and poultry feed, but feeding the entire seeds to livestock has been considered to be a poor investment because of the high cost involved (although subsidization in europe allows such usage, especially in france where hemp seeds are not legally permitted in human food).
although it might seem that hemp bast fibers are desirable in composite wood products because of their length and strength, in fact the short fibers of the hurds have been found to produce a superior product (k. domier, pers.
unfortunately there was no market for the new “wonder crop” and hundreds of farmers lost about $20 million (paarlberg 1990).

probably more so than any plant in living memory, hemp attracts people to attempt its cultivation without first acquiring a realistic appreciation of the possible pitfalls.
one of the reasons hemp fiber has been valued is because of its length.
hemp fiber can potentially replace other biological fibers in many applications, but also, as noted below, can sometimes compete with minerals such as glass fiber and steel.
another strategy has been to select stems that are hollow at the internodes, with limited wood, since this maximizes production of fiber in relation to supporting woody tissues.

fields intended for hemp use are still frequently normally cleared of weeds using herbicides, but so long as hemp is thickly seeded (as is always done when hemp is grown for fiber), the rapidly developing young plants normally shade out competing weeds.
processing costs are higher for industrial hemp because the fibers vary from the standard specifications for fiber length and diameter established for the equipment used in most textile and apparel factories, necessitating the use of specialty machines.
the traditional and still major first step in fiber extraction is to ret (“rot”) away the softer parts of the plant, by exposing the cut stems to microbial decay in the field (“dew retting,” shown in figs. 46 and 47) or submerged in water (“water retting, ” shown in fig. 13).

retted stalks are loosely held together, and for highest quality fiber applications need to be decorticated, scutched, hackled, and combed to remove the remaining pieces of stalks, broken fibers, and extraneous material.
table 3 shows the “economic significance” (dollars generated in the black market plus dollar cost of control measures) of the illicit drug industry associated with c. sativa, and contrasts this with the estimated dollar value of major categories of legitimate uses.
hemp is a novelty product with limited sustainable development value even in a novelty market… for every proposed use of industrial hemp, there already exists an available product, or raw material, which is cheaper to manufacture and provides better market results….
however, the attempts to destroy the wild populations are short-sighted, because they are a natural genetic reservoir, mostly low in thc.
such marketing is unfortunate, sending the message that some in the industry are indifferent to the negative image that this generates in the minds of much of the potential consuming public.
in general, the novelty of hemp means that many consumers are willing to pay a premium price.
bottom left: fiber cultivars are grown at high density, and are unbranched and very tall.
this results in small levels of thc appearing in hempseed oil and foods made with the seeds.
more than a century ago, an expert on hemp concluded his manual on hemp-growing in the us by stating “there is no question that when the inventive genius, comprehension and energies of the american people become interested, another grand source of profitable employment and prosperity will be established” (boyce 1900).
seed that has been sterilized tends to go rancid quickly, and so it is imperative that fresh seed be available, a great advantage for domestic production.
accordingly, sterilized or roasted hemp seeds, and products made from hemp seed that have been subjected to cooking, should be fresh.
right, the collection of the vavilov institute, st. petersburg; of the 278 accessions for which chemical analyses were reported in anonymous (1975), about 55% had thc levels >0.3%.
the mineralized material can be blown or poured into the cavities of walls and in attics as insulation.
relatively little material needs to be cultivated for medicinal purposes (small 1971), although security considerations considerably inflate costs.
nevertheless it has been suggested that the core fibers could be used for paper making, providing appropriate technology was developed (de groot et al. 1998).
addition of anti-oxidants prolongs the longevity of the oil.
larger production volumes and lower prices may be possible, in which case hemp oil may find industrial uses similar to those of linseed (flax), soybean, and sunflower oils, which are presently used in paints, inks, solvents, binders, and in polymer plastics.
amounts of unmarketable grain and baled hemp straw.
market considerations also heavily determine the wisdom of investing in hemp.
related to geotextile applications is the possibility of using hemp fiber as a planting substrate (biodegradable pots and blocks for plants), and as biodegradable twine to replace plastic ties used to attach plants to supporting poles.
although the environmental and biodiversity benefits of growing hemp have been greatly exaggerated in the popular press, c. sativa is nevertheless exceptionally suitable for organic agriculture, and is remarkably less “ecotoxic” in comparison to most other crops (montford and small 1999b).
in 1999, the eu produced about 27,000 t of hemp fiber, but only about 6,200 t of hemp seeds, mostly in france, and 90% of this was used as animal feed (karus et al. 2000).
cannabis sativa is also relatively resistant to weeds, and so usually requires relatively little herbicide.
the gatersleben gene bank of germany, the 2nd largest public gene bank in europe, has a much smaller cannabis collection, with less than 40 accessions (detailed information on the hemp accessions of the gatersleben gene bank are available at fox-serv.ipk-gatersleben.de/).
insect repellant silage animal food (whole seeds for birds, presscake for mammalian livestock)
further, china’s supremacy in the production of high-quality hemp textiles at low prices will be very difficult to match, while domestic production of oilseeds can be carried out using technology that is already available.
in the plant the cannabinoids exist predominantly in the form of carboxylic acids, which decarboxylate with time or when heated.
essential oil of different strains varies considerably in odor, and this may have economic importance in imparting a scent to cosmetics, shampoos, soaps, creams, oils, perfumes, and foodstuffs.
however, saeglitz et al. (2000) demonstrated that the spread of beet pollen is not effectively prevented by hemp hedges.
while it is true that foreign imports have been the basis for hemp products in north america for at least a decade, north american production is only 4 years of age in canada, and farming of hemp in the us has not even begun.
putting tall whole plants through a conventional combine results in the straw winding around moving parts, and the fibers working into bearings, causing breakdown, fires, high maintenance, and frustration.
the limited branching of fiber cultivars is often compensated for by possession of large leaves with wide leaflets, which obviously increase the photosynthetic ability of the plants.
the gatersleben gene bank of germany, the 2nd largest public gene bank in europe, has a much smaller cannabis collection, with less than 40 accessions (detailed information on the hemp accessions of the gatersleben gene bank are available at fox-serv.ipk-gatersleben.de/).
according to a national organization for the reform of marijuana laws (norml) (mir.drugtext.org/marijuananews/marijuana_ranks_fourth_largest_c.htm) marijuana is at least the fourth most valuable crop in america, outranked only by corn, soybeans, and hay.
steam sterilization of the seeds, often required by law, allows air to penetrate and so stimulates rancidity.
marijuana was judged to be the largest revenue producing crop in alabama, california, colorado, hawaii, kentucky, maine, rhode island, tennessee, virginia, and west virginia, and one of the top five cash crops in 29 other states.
fiber production should also be governed by availability of moisture throughout the season, and the need for high humidity in the late summer and fall for retting, so that large areas of the interior and west of north america are not adapted to growing fiber hemp.
both in canada and the us, the most critical problem to be addressed for commercial exploitation of c. sativa is the possible unauthorized drug use of the plant.
some special hybrids, obtained by pollinating females of dioecious lines with pollen from monoecious plants, are predominantly female (so-called “all-female,” these generally also produce some hermaphrodites and occasional males).
non-fiber strains rarely have as much as 15% fiber in the bark.
still another important advantage is the precise control over production quantities and schedule that is possible with annual crops.
still another consideration is the “green ideal” of producing locally for local needs; by this credo, hemp is preferable in temperate regions to the use of tropical fibers, which need to be imported.
as noted above, the oilcake remaining after oil is expressed from the seeds is a very nutritious feed supplement for livestock, but it can also be used for production of a high-protein flour.
canada is specialized on oilseed production and processing, so that hemp oil and grain are much more suitable than fiber.
in canada, every acquisition of hemp grown at a particular place and time must be tested for thc content by an independent laboratory and, under the industrial hemp regulations, fields of hemp with more than 0.3% thc may require destruction (a slight degree of flexibility is generally exercised).
unless the producer participates in sharing of value-added income, large profits are unlikely.
and, directly or indirectly, the lumber/paper industry receives subsidies and/or supports, which is most unlikely for hemp.
waste straw is widely available from cereals and other crops, and although generally not nearly as desirable as hemp, can produce bulk pulp far more cheaply than can be made from hemp.
fields intended for hemp use are still frequently normally cleared of weeds using herbicides, but so long as hemp is thickly seeded (as is always done when hemp is grown for fiber), the rapidly developing young plants normally shade out competing weeds.
however, the canadian government has found that some french material has proven to be excessively high in thc.
hemp fibers added to concrete increase tensile strength while reducing shrinkage and cracking.
in addition, there are substantial social costs, such as adverse effects on users, particularly those who are convicted.

the body shop now markets an impressive array of hemp nutraceutical cosmetics (fig. 39), and this has given the industry considerable credibility.
doubtless in the unlikely event that it became possible, many would grow hemp as an ornamental.
organic matter is preferably over 3.5%, phosphorus should be medium to high (>40 ppm), potassium should be medium to high (>250 ppm), sulfur good (>5,000 ppm), and calcium not in excess (<6,000 ppm).
essential oil of different strains varies considerably in odor, and this may have economic importance in imparting a scent to cosmetics, shampoos, soaps, creams, oils, perfumes, and foodstuffs.
accordingly, europe is far more advanced in hemp development with respect to all fiber-based applications than other parts of the world.
in traditional hemp processing, the long fiber was separated from the internal woody hurds in two steps, breaking (stalks were crushed under rollers that broke the woody core into short pieces, some of which were separated) and scutching (the remaining hurds, short fibers (“tow”) and long fibers (“line fiber, ” “long-line fiber”) were separated).
such appears to be unsurpassed for horse bedding, and also make an excellent litter for cats and other pets (fig.
it was estimated that 8.7 million marijuana plants were harvested in 1997, worth $15.1 billion to growers and $25.2 billion on the retail market (the wholesale value was used to compare marijuana to other cash crops).
as noted above, hemp seed cake makes an excellent feed for animals.
small crops have been harvested with sickle-bar mowers and hay swathers, but plugging of equipment is a constant problem.
we suggest that an average productivity of 2 t/ha will be necessary to transform hempseed into a major oilseed, and that this breeding goal is achievable.
improved microorganisms or enzymes could augment or replace traditional water retting.
while the value of unsaturated fats is generally appreciated, it is much less well known that the north american diet is serious nutritionally unbalanced by an excess of linoleic over alpha-linonenic acid.
the second breeding goal is for larger seeds, as these are more easily shelled.
this is dioecious, short (about a meter in height), highly branched, with large leaves (i.e. wide leaflets), and it is slow to mature.
once stalks are retted, dried, and baled, they are processed to extract the fiber.
in addition, various european nations and private firms contributed to the development of hemp technologies.
in 1999 over 20,000 t of natural fiber were used for these purposes in europe, including about, 2,000 t of hemp.

a crude comparison of the biodiversity friendliness of selected major crops and three cannabis sativa crops (fiber, oilseed, drug) based on 26 criteria (after montford and small 1999a).
additionally, the general attitude towards cannabis, in which it is seen only as a drug of abuse and addiction, has not helped.”
however, wild plants of c. sativa have naturally undergone selection for high seed productivity, and are a particularly important potential source of breeding germplasm.
non-fiber strains rarely have as much as 15% fiber in the bark.
the high degree of unsaturation is responsible for the extreme sensitivity to oxidative rancidity.
in addition to textiles used in clothing, coarser woven cloth (canvas) is used for upholstery, bags, sacks, and tarpaulins.
all eight amino acids essential in the human diet are present, as well as others.
at present the main materials used are polymeric (polythene, spun-blown polypropylene) and some glass fiber and natural fibers.
while crop residues like cereal straw will probably supply much of the need, specialty fiber plants such as hemp also have potential.
hemp is of high nutritional quality because it contains high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, mostly oleic acid (c18:1, 10%–16%), linoleic acid (c18:2, 50%–60%), alpha-linolenic acid (c18:3, 20%–25%), and gamma-linolenic acid (c18:3, 2%–5%)
shingles are 60% hemp in a synthetic polymer.
while small, secretory, resin-producing glands occur on the epidermis of most of the above-ground parts of the plant, the glands are very dense and productive on the perigonal bracts, which are accordingly of central interest in marijuana varieties.
the potential as a “new crop” for medicinal cannabinoid uses is therefore limited.
budgetary problems in russia have endangered the survival of this invaluable collection, and every effort needs to be made to find new funding to preserve it.
hemp is a bast fiber crop, i.e. the most desirable (“long”) fibers are found in the phloem-associated tissues external to the phloem, just under the “bark.”
linseed oil, a drying oil, has a very high percentage of linolenic acid.
the equipment for this is rare in north america, and consequently use of domestically-produced fiber for high quality textile applications is extremely limited.
the hundreds of seed collections acquired for small’s studies (reviewed in small 1979) were destroyed in 1980 because canadian government policy at that time envisioned no possibility that hemp would ever be developed as a legitimate crop.
figure 11 shows thc concentrations in the vavilov collection, as well as in our own collection, largely of european germplasm.
another strategy has been to select stems that are hollow at the internodes, with limited wood, since this maximizes production of fiber in relation to supporting woody tissues.
given these current demands for research on medicinal marijuana, it will be necessary to produce crops of drug types of c. sativa.
insofar as hemp reduces the need to harvest trees for building materials or other products, its use as a wood substitute will tend to contribute to preserving biodiversity.
however, feeding entire plants is another matter, because the leaves are covered with the resin-producing glands.

about 25% of north americans are believed to have used cannabis illegally.
hemp fibers are produced at much more cost than wood chips and straw from many other crops, so high-end applications requiring high strength seem most appropriate.
at present, gla is available in health food shops and pharmacies primarily as soft gelatin capsules of borage or evening primrose oil, but hemp is almost certainly a much more economic source.

while the narcotics image of c. sativa is often disadvantageous, advertisers who choose to play up this association do so knowing that it will attract a segment of the consuming population.
while oilseed land races in northern russia would have been short, early-maturing plants in view of the short growing season, in more southern areas oilseed landraces likely had moderate height, and were spaced more widely to allow abundant branching and seed production to develop.
a tall fiber-type of hemp plant is shown at left, and a short narcotic variety (identified as “panama gold”) at right.

an inquiry regarding the 56 united states department of agriculture hemp germplasm collections supplied to and grown by small and beckstead (1973) resulted in the reply that there are no remaining hemp collections in usda germplasm holdings, and indeed that were such to be found they would have to be destroyed.
from the individual producer’s perspective, the old adage “find your market before you plant your seed” remains sound advice.
cannabinoids are produced in specialized epidermal glands, which differ notably in distribution on different organs of the plant (high concentrations occur on the upper surface of the young leaves and young twigs, on the tepals, stamens, and especially on the perigonal bract).
pharmacologists have the tools and the methodologies to realize its considerable potential, provided the political climate permits them to do so .”
ten years ago hemp cultivation was illegal in germany, england, canada, australia, and other countries.
most significantly, modern selection is occurring with regard to mechanized harvesting, particularly the ability to grow in high density as single-headed stalks with very short branches bearing considerable seed.
unlike fiber strains that have been selected to grow well at extremely high densities, drug strains tend to be less persistent when grown in high concentration (de meijer 1994).
the cost of enforcing the laws against cannabis in north america is in the billions of dollars annually.

accordingly, europe is far more advanced in hemp development with respect to all fiber-based applications than other parts of the world.
a chief argument that has been advanced in favor of developing hemp as a paper and pulp source has been that as a non-wood or tree-free fiber source, it can reduce harvesting of primary forests and the threat to associated biodiversity.
it is important to understand, therefore, that the quality of modern hemp seed for human consumption far exceeds anything produced historically.
natural fibers in automobile composites are used primarily in press-molded parts (fig. 18).
the reader is warned that this book, as well as almost all of the literature on hemp, is very much more concerned with fiber production than oilseed production.

industrial hemp grows well in areas that corn produces high yields.
coco (coir) fiber has been said to be much more suitable, due to higher lignin content (40%–50%, compared to 2%–5% in bast fibers); these are much cheaper than flax and hemp fibers (karus et al. 2000).
hempseed oil has been classified as a semi-drying oil, like soybean oil, and is therefore more suited to edible than industrial oil purposes.
moreover, summarizing four state analyses of hemp production (mcnulty 1995, ehrensing 1998, kraenzel et al. 1998, thompson et al. 1998), profitability seemed doubtful.

natural fibers in automobile composites are used primarily in press-molded parts (fig. 18).
in addition to textiles used in clothing, coarser woven cloth (canvas) is used for upholstery, bags, sacks, and tarpaulins.
the traditional and still major first step in fiber extraction is to ret (“rot”) away the softer parts of the plant, by exposing the cut stems to microbial decay in the field (“dew retting,” shown in figs. 46 and 47) or submerged in water (“water retting, ” shown in fig. 13).

probably more so than any plant in living memory, hemp attracts people to attempt its cultivation without first acquiring a realistic appreciation of the possible pitfalls.
low plant densities, as commonly found in growing tall european cultivars for seed, may not suppress weed growth adequately, and under these circumstances resort to herbicides may pose a problem for those wishing to grow hempseed organically.
hemp seeds contain virtually no thc, but thc contamination results from contact of the seeds with the resin secreted by the epidermal glands on the leaves and floral parts, and also by the failure to sift away all of the bracts (which have the highest concentration of thc of any parts of the plant) that cover the seeds.
unlike flax, hemp long fiber requires water retting for preparation of high-quality spinnable fibers for production of fine textiles.
fiber production should also be governed by availability of moisture throughout the season, and the need for high humidity in the late summer and fall for retting, so that large areas of the interior and west of north america are not adapted to growing fiber hemp.
the canadian system of monitoring thc content has rigidly limited hemp cultivation to cultivars that consistently develop thc levels below 0.3%.
since virgin pulp is required for added strength in the recycling of paper, hemp pulp would allow for at least twice as many cycles as wood pulp.

these include ‘finola,’ formerly known as ‘fin-314’ (fig. 6) and ‘anka’ (fig. 7), which are relatively short, little-branched, mature early in north-temperate regions, and are ideal for high-density planting and harvest with conventional equipment.
wild north american plants have undergone many generations of natural adaptation to local conditions of climate, soil and pests, and accordingly it is safe to conclude that they harbor genes that are invaluable for the improvement of hemp cultivars.
the composition of extracted essential oil is quite different from the volatiles released around the fresh plant (particularly limonene and alpha-pinene), so that a pleasant odor of the living plant is not necessarily indicative of a pleasant-smelling essential oil.

hempline in ontario, the first firm to grow hemp for commercial purposes in north america since the second word war (starting with experimental cultivation in 1994), is the exception, and is concerned with production of fiber for upholstery and carpeting.
of course, the high thc in drug cultivars makes these a difficult source of germplasm.
while the narcotics image of c. sativa is often disadvantageous, advertisers who choose to play up this association do so knowing that it will attract a segment of the consuming population.
this is dioecious, short (about a meter in height), highly branched, with large leaves (i.e. wide leaflets), and it is slow to mature.
the essential oil is a mixture of volatile compounds, including monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and other terpenoid-like compounds that are manufactured in the same epidermal glands in which the resin of cannabis is synthesized (meier and mediavilla 1998).

such appears to be unsurpassed for horse bedding, and also make an excellent litter for cats and other pets (fig. 31).
because hemp hurds are a costly product, it is likely that animal bedding will remain the most important application.
growing short varieties dedicated to grain production eliminates many of the above problems, and since the profitability of hemp straw is limited at present, seems preferable.
the hurds can absorb up to five times their weight in moisture (typically 50% higher than wood shavings), do not produce dust (following initial dust removal), and are easily composted.
as well, the hurds become more difficult to separate.

if not turned, the stems close to the ground will remain green while the top ones are retted and turn brown.
other desirable features of hemp fibers are strength and durability (particularly resistance to decay), which made hemp useful in the past for rope, nets, sail-cloth, and oakum for caulking.
in traditional hemp processing, the long fiber was separated from the internal woody hurds in two steps, breaking (stalks were crushed under rollers that broke the woody core into short pieces, some of which were separated) and scutching (the remaining hurds, short fibers (“tow”) and long fibers (“line fiber, ” “long-line fiber”) were separated).
moreover, density of cultivation is used to accentuate certain architectural features.
as noted above, the oilcake remaining after oil is expressed from the seeds is a very nutritious feed supplement for livestock, but it can also be used for production of a high-protein flour.

an absence of such fiber-strain traits as tallness, limited branching, long internodes, and very hollow stems, is characteristic of narcotic strains.
because hemp is regaining its ancient status as an important crop, a number of private germplasm collections have been assembled for the breeding of cultivars as commercial ventures (de meijer and van soest 1992; de meijer 1998), and of course these are available only on a restricted basis, if at all.

increasing limitation of cheap labor for traditional production in europe and the new world led to the creation of some mechanical inventions, but too late to counter growing interest in competitive crops.
in western europe, the fiber is often “cottonized,” i.e. chopped into short segments the size of cotton and flax fiber, so that the fibers can be processed on flax processing machinery, which is very much better developed than such machinery is for hemp.

because of the extensive development of oilseeds in canada, there is extensive capacity to produce high-quality cold-pressed hemp oil.
hemp requires about the same fertility as a high-yielding crop of wheat.
such highly-branched plants can produce very large quantities of seeds, and may be useful for breeding.
moreover, the ability to last outdoors for many years is frequently undesirable in geotextiles.
good soil moisture is necessary for seed germination, and plenty of rainfall is needed for good growth, especially during the first 6 weeks.
it is important to understand, therefore, that the quality of modern hemp seed for human consumption far exceeds anything produced historically.
this is primarily because of the legal, ethical and bureaucratic difficulties in conducting trials with patients.
seeding rate is specific to each variety, and this information should be sought from the supplier.
growing hemp unfortunately has a magnetic attraction to many, so there is danger of overproduction.
it has been contended that hemp is notably superior to most crops in terms of biomass production, but van der werf (1994b) noted that the annual dry matter yield of hemp (rarely approaching 20 t/ha) is not exceptional compared to maize, beet, or potato.
it has been estimated that 5–10 kg of natural fibers can be used in the molded portions of an average automobile (excluding upholstery).
because hemp is regaining its ancient status as an important crop, a number of private germplasm collections have been assembled for the breeding of cultivars as commercial ventures (de meijer and van soest 1992; de meijer 1998), and of course these are available only on a restricted basis, if at all.
however, the canadian government has found that some french material has proven to be excessively high in thc.
it is well known in the illicit trade how to screen off the more potent fractions of the plant in order to increase thc levels in resultant drug products.
because hemp hurds are a costly product, it is likely that animal bedding will remain the most important application.
the foundations, walls, floors, and ceilings of houses have been made using hemp hurds mixed with natural lime and water.
quality is improved by using only the first pressing, and minimizing the number of green seeds present.
related to geotextile applications is the possibility of using hemp fiber as a planting substrate (biodegradable pots and blocks for plants), and as biodegradable twine to replace plastic ties used to attach plants to supporting poles.
noting the oversupply of hempseeds associated with canada’s 12,000 ha in 1999, the report concluded that the long term demand for hemp products is uncertain, and predicts that the hemp market in the us will likely remain small and limited.
when grown in north-temperate climates maturation is much-delayed until late fall, or the plants succumb to cold weather before they are able to produce seeds.
even when one has suitably separated long fiber, specialized harvesting, processing, spinning and weaving equipment are required for preparing fine hemp textiles.
essential oil essential (volatile) oil in hemp is quite different from hempseed oil.
the limited branching of fiber cultivars is often compensated for by possession of large leaves with wide leaflets, which obviously increase the photosynthetic ability of the plants.
by contrast, letniak et al. (2000) conducted an experimental trial of hemp as silage.
several of the cannabinoids are reputed to have medicinal potential: thc for glaucoma, spasticity from spinal injury or multiple sclerosis, pain, inflammation, insomnia, and asthma; cbd for some psychological problems.
figure 11 shows thc concentrations in the vavilov collection, as well as in our own collection, largely of european germplasm.
whereas china used to supply most of the hempseed used for food in north america, canadian-grown seeds have taken over this market.
in the early 1980s in minnesota, jerusalem artichoke was touted as a fuel, a feed, a food, and a sugar crop.
it is clear that there is a culture of idealistic believers in hemp in north america, and that there is great determination to establish the industry.
figure 2 presents the basic morphology of the species.
hemp fibers tend to wrap around combine belts, bearings, indeed any moving part, and have resulted in large costs of combine repairs (estimated at $10.00/ha).
this seed meal should be distinguished from the protein-rich, oil-poor seed cake remaining after oil has been expressed, that is used for livestock feed.
take a look around and grab therss feed to stay updated.
we have encountered exceptionally vigorous wild canadian plants (fig. 52), and grown wild plants from europe (fig. 53) which could prove valuable.
medicinal marijuana marijuana has in fact been grown for medicinal research in north america by both the canadian (fig. 40) and american governments, and this will likely continue.
noting the oversupply of hempseeds associated with canada’s 12,000 ha in 1999, the report concluded that the long term demand for hemp products is uncertain, and predicts that the hemp market in the us will likely remain small and limited.
thc content has proven to be more easily reduced in monoecious than in dioecious varieties.
thc content has proven to be more easily reduced in monoecious than in dioecious varieties.
notable are the health-promoting gamma-linolenic acid; improving the amino acid spectrum of the protein; and increasing the antioxidant level, which would not only have health benefits but could increase the shelf life of hemp oil and foods.
as noted above, unwise investment in canada produced a glut of seeds that resulted in price dumping and unprofitable levels for the majority.
hemp fibers are produced at much more cost than wood chips and straw from many other crops, so high-end applications requiring high strength seem most appropriate.
a 3- or preferably 4-year rotation may involve cereals, clover or alfalfa for green manure, maize, and hemp.
staminate or “male” plants tend to be 10%–15% taller and are less robust than the pistillate or “female” (note the comparatively frail male in fig. 3).
fiber strains have been selected for low seed production, so that most hemp germplasm has certainly not been selected for oilseed characteristics.
countries with low labor costs such as the philippines and china have a competitive advantage over any us hemp producer.”
fiber in retted hemp stem.
comparative annual world economic significance of categories of cannabis activity.
canadian experience with growing hemp commercially for the last 4 years has convinced many growers that it is better to use a single-purpose cultivar, seed or fiber, than a dual-purpose cultivar.
hemp was often grown on farms with marginal incomes in the hopes that it was a savior from a downward financial spiral.
but marketing based on the healthful and tasteful properties of hemp food products, the durable nature of hemp textiles, and the environmental advantages of the crop has proven to be widely acceptable, and is likely to promote the long term development of hemp industries.
flowering branch of female plant.
a john deere kemper harvester, with circular drums that cut and chop hemp stalks, shown in operation in southern ontario.
more importantly, hempseed oil is not competitive, except in the novelty niche market, with the popular food oils.
dried plant parts and extracts of cannabis have received rather extensive usage for these purposes in the past, raising the possibility that research could produce formulations of commercial value.
this apocryphal story holds a germ of truth—hemp seed is astonishingly nutritional.
in practice, however, the illicit drug trade has access to easier methods of synthesizing thc or its analogues than by first extracting cbd from non-drug hemp strains.
in former, labor-intensive times, the male plants were harvested earlier than the females, to produce superior fiber.
it has had limited success, of course, because there are very few circumstances that permit private gardeners can grow cannabis as an ornamental today.
hemp food products cannot escape their niche market status until the price of hempseed rivals that of other oilseeds, particularly rapeseed, flax, and sunflower.
the root is a laterally branched taproot, generally 30–60 cm deep, up to 2.5 m in loose soils, very near the surface and more branched in wet soils.
the two portions of stem are separated in this photograph, and are joined by the tough bark fibers.
selection for fiber has resulted in strains that have much more bark fiber tissues and much less woody core than encountered in narcotic strains, oilseed strains, and wild plants (fig. 12).
retting in tanks rather than in open bodies of water is a way of controlling the effluents while taking advantage of the high-quality fiber that is produced.
bottom right: some recent oilseed cultivars are grown at moderate density and are short and relatively unbranched.
growing hemp to the stage that mature seeds are present compromises the quality of the fiber, because of lignification.
jain and arora (1988) fed narcotic cannabis refuse to cattle, and found that the animals “suffered variable degrees of depression and revealed incoordination in movement.”
it is important to note that hemp is the only current natural food source of gla, i.e. not requiring the consumption of extracted dietary supplements.
provincial agronomists in canada now have experience with hemp, and can make local recommendations.
cluster of male flowers.
among the problems that canadian farmers have faced are the challenge of government licensing (some delays, and a large learning curve), very expensive and sometime poor seed (farmers are not allowed to generate their own seed), teenagers raiding fields in the mistaken belief that marijuana is being grown, and great difficulties in exportation because of the necessity of convincing authorities that hemp is not a narcotic.
at present, losses of 30% of the seed yields are not uncommon, so that improvements in
about two thirds of hempseed protein is edestin.
hemp, especially the hurds, can be burned as is or processed into charcoal, methanol, methane, or gasoline through pyrolysis (destructive distillation).
top left: narcotic plants are generally low, highly branched, and grown well-spaced.
according to the us national institute on drug abuse (www.nida.nih.gov/infofax/marijuana.html), more than 72 million americans (33%) 12 years of age and older have tried marijuana.
hempline in ontario, the first firm to grow hemp for commercial purposes in north america since the second word war (starting with experimental cultivation in 1994), is the exception, and is concerned with production of fiber for upholstery and carpeting.
some special hybrids, obtained by pollinating females of dioecious lines with pollen from monoecious plants, are predominantly female (so-called “all-female,” these generally also produce some hermaphrodites and occasional males).
the second world war led to a brief revival of hemp cultivation in the midwest, as well as in canada, because the war cut off supplies of fiber (substantial renewed cultivation also occurred in germany for the same reason).
this vigorous plant had a fresh weight of 1.5 kg.
a thc concentration in marijuana of approximately 0.9% has been suggested as a practical minimum level to achieve the (illegal) intoxicant effect, but cbd (the predominant cannabinoid of fiber and oilseed varieties) antagonizes (i.e. reduces) the effects of thc (grotenhermen and karus 1998).
the recent focus of canadian hemp breeders has been to develop cultivars with high seed yields, low stature (to avoid channeling the plants’ energy into stalk, as is the case in fiber cultivars), early maturation (for the short growing seasons of canada), and desirable fatty acid spectrum (especially gamma-linolenic acid).
of course, all other types of transportation vehicles from bicycles to airplanes might make use of such technology.
however, appropriate processing and blending with other natural fibers has significantly improved the “feel” of the product, and in china hemp textiles indistinguishable from fine linens in texture are available.
the cultivation of hemp in the eu is heavily weighted toward fiber production over oilseed production.
baling can be done with any kind of baler (fig. 48).
no significant differences were found between yield of the hemp and of barley/oat silage fed to heifers, suggesting that fermenting hemp plants reduces possible harmful constituents.
with respect to textiles, the report noted the lack of a thriving textile flax (linen) us industry (despite lack of legal barriers), so that it would seem unlikely that hemp could achieve a better market status.
judged on experience in canada to date, the industry is inclined to specialize on either fiber or grain, but not both.
densities for seed production for tall, european, dual-purpose cultivars are less than for short oilseed cultivars.
both woven and non-woven fibers can be applied to geotextiles; woven and knitted materials are stronger and the open structure may be advantageous (e.g. in allowing plants to grow through), but non-wovens are cheaper and better at suppressing weeds.
the woody core fibers are short—about 0.55 mm—and like hardwood fibers are cemented together with considerable lignin.
canadian experience with growing hemp commercially for the last 4 years has convinced many growers that it is better to use a single-purpose cultivar, seed or fiber, than a dual-purpose cultivar.
it has been estimated that 5–10 kg of natural fibers can be used in the molded portions of an average automobile (excluding upholstery).
a principal limitation is climatic—the local environment should be suitably but not excessively moist at the close of the harvest season.
however, the added-value potential in the form of proprietary drug derivatives and drug-delivery systems is huge.
those involved in value-added processing and distribution are also faced with legal uncertainties and the regular threat of idiosyncratic, indeed irrational actions of various governments.
economies of scale are such that the supply of hemp is minute compared to the supply of wood fiber.
using hemp directly for paper was considered too expensive, and in any event the demand for paper was far more limited than today.
for most of its history, c. sativa was most valued as a fiber source, considerably less so as an intoxicant, and only to a limited extent as an oilseed crop.
this stem was bent sharply after retting, breaking the woody central portion (hurds), leaving the bark fibers unbroken.
whereas china used to supply most of the hempseed used for food in north america, canadian-grown seeds have taken over this market.
because hemp food products are considered to have great economic potential, there is considerable pressure on the hemp industry in north america to reduce thc levels.
coco (coir) fiber has been said to be much more suitable, due to higher lignin content (40%–50%, compared to 2%–5% in bast fibers); these are much cheaper than flax and hemp fibers (karus et al. 2000).
weaving of hemp fibers into textiles and apparel is primarily done in china, hungary, romania, russia, and the ukraine.
it is important to note that hemp is the only current natural food source of gla, i.e. not requiring the consumption of extracted dietary supplements.
staminate or “male” plants tend to be 10%–15% taller and are less robust than the pistillate or “female” (note the comparatively frail male in fig. 3).

for edible purposes, hempseed oil is extracted by cold pressing.
alcoholic beverages made with hemp utilize hempseed as a flavorant.
the present productivity of oilseed hemp—about 1 t/ha under good conditions, and occasional reports of 1.5 to 2 t/ha, is not yet sufficient for the crop to become competitive with north america’s major oilseeds.
the recent focus of canadian hemp breeders has been to develop cultivars with high seed yields, low stature (to avoid channeling the plants’ energy into stalk, as is the case in fiber cultivars), early maturation (for the short growing seasons of canada), and desirable fatty acid spectrum (especially gamma-linolenic acid).
most germplasm stocks of hemp are in europe, and the largest and most important collection is the vavilov institute gene bank in leningrad.
hemp paper products (writing paper, notebook, envelopes).
based on world production of fibers in 1999, about 54.5% was synthetic (of which 60.3% was polyester), 42.9% was plant fiber (of which 78.5% was cotton), and 2.6% was wool (karus 2000).
until canada replaced china in 1998 as a source of imported seeds for the us, most seeds used for various purposes in the us were sterilized and imported from china.
however, various analyses have concluded that the use of hemp for conventional paper pulp is not profitable (fertig 1996).

the pulp and paper industry based on wood has considered the use of hemp for pulp, but only on an experimental basis.
modern seed dehulling using mechanical separation produces a smooth, white, gritless hemp seed meal that needs no additional treatment before it is consumed.
flax and hemp fibers exposed to water and soil have been claimed to disintegrate rapidly over the course of a few months, which would make them unacceptable for products that need to have long-term stability when exposed to water and oil.
minor uses biomass it has been contended that hemp is notably superior to most crops in terms of biomass production, but van der werf (1994b) noted that the annual dry matter yield of hemp (rarely approaching 20 t/ha) is not exceptional compared to maize, beet, or potato.
canned hulled hemp seed.
seed, showing narrow face.
efforts are underway in europe to add value in the form of processed products for hemp, especially cosmetics and food but, as noted below, the north american market is already quite advanced in oilseed applications.
at present, gla is available in health food shops and pharmacies primarily as soft gelatin capsules of borage or evening primrose oil, but hemp is almost certainly a much more economic source.

experimental production of hemp fiberboard has produced extremely strong material (fig. 22).
drug varieties have been observed to produce more than a kilogram of seed per plant, so that a target yield of several tonnes per hectare is conceivable (watson and clarke 1997).
because of the similarities of flax and hemp, the technologies developed for one usually are adaptable to the other.
a thc concentration in marijuana of approximately 0.9% has been suggested as a practical minimum level to achieve the (illegal) intoxicant effect, but cbd (the predominant cannabinoid of fiber and oilseed varieties) antagonizes (i.e. reduces) the effects of thc (grotenhermen and karus 1998).
although hemp plants can lodge, on the whole very tall hemp is remarkably resistant against wind.
hempseed oil has been classified as a semi-drying oil, like soybean oil, and is therefore more suited to edible than industrial oil purposes.
nevertheless, themarihuana tax act applied in 1938 essentially ended hemp production in the united states, although a small hemp fiber industry continued in wisconsin until 1958.
organic certification is much more reliable in north america than in the foreign countries that offer cheap seeds.
however, the short, bulky fibers found in the inner part of the plant (hurds) can also be used to make cheaper grades of paper, apparently without greatly affecting quality of the printing surface.
growing short varieties dedicated to grain production eliminates many of the above problems, and since the profitability of hemp straw is limited at present, seems preferable.
relatively little material needs to be cultivated for medicinal purposes (small 1971), although security considerations considerably inflate costs.
in addition, various european nations and private firms contributed to the development of hemp technologies.
mcpartland et al. (2000) is the best presentation available on diseases and pests, which fortunately under most circumstances do limited damage.
mölleken et al. (1997) studied effects of high concentration of salts of copper, chromium, and zinc on hemp, and demonstrated that some hemp cultivars have potential application to growth in contaminated soils.
hemp is of high nutritional quality because it contains high amounts of unsaturated fatty acids, mostly oleic acid (c18:1, 10%–16%), linoleic acid (c18:2, 50%–60%), alpha-linolenic acid (c18:3, 20%–25%), and gamma-linolenic acid (c18:3, 2%–5%) (fig. 37).

hemp stalks are very bulky, requiring much handling and storage.
seed is best planted at 2–3 cm (twice as deep will be tolerated).
the american agricultural community has observed this, and has had success at the state level in persuading legislators of the advisability of experimental hemp cultivation as a means of evaluating the wisdom of re-establishing american hemp production.
the us drug enforcement administration’s online criminal justice statistics for 2000 (cscmosaic.albany.edu/sourcebook/1995/pdf/t440.pdf) shows the following seizures and eradication of plants of c. sativa: 40,929 outdoor plots (2,597,796 plants), 139,580,728 ditchweed (ruderal plants), 2,361 indoor operations (217,105 plants), for a grand total of 2,814, 903 plants destroyed.

this variety is best suited for grain production.
the hurds are sometimes molded into small pellets for bedding applications (fig. 30).
in hempseed, linoleic and alpha-linolenic occur in a ratio of about 3:1, considered optimal in healthy human adipose tissue, and apparently unique among common plant oils (deferne and pate 1996).
as argued above, to be competitive, hemp should produce approximately 2 t/ha; at present 1 t/ha is considered average to good production.
the value of hemp oil from the point of view of the primary components is discussed below.
we suggest that an average productivity of 2 t/ha will be necessary to transform hempseed into a major oilseed, and that this breeding goal is achievable.
leson (2000) found that this level was not exceeded by consuming hemp products, provided that thc levels are maintained below 5 ppm in hemp oil, and below 2 ppm in hulled seeds.
selecting monoecious strains overcomes the problem of differential maturation times and quality of male (staminate) and female (pistillate) plants (males mature 1–3 weeks earlier).
in europe, the animal bedding market is not considered important (karus et al. 2000), but in north america there are insufficient hemp hurds available to meet market demand.
the refinement of equipment and new technologies are viewed as offering the possibility of making fine textile production practical in western europe and north america, but at present china controls this market, and probably will remain dominant for the foreseeable future.
in general in the eu and canada, fibers are not separated into tow and line fibers, but are left as “whole fiber.”
body care products offered by the body shop.
except for the troublesome characteristic of dying after anthesis, male traits are favored for fiber production, in contrast to the situation for drug strains noted below.
van roekel (1994) has pointed out that egyptian papyrus sheets are not “paper,” because the fiber strands are woven, not “wet-laid;” the oldest surviving paper is over 2,000 years of age, from china, and was made from hemp fiber (fleming and clarke 1998).
narcotic strains tend to be more attractive in odor than fiber strains, and because they produce much higher numbers of flowers than fiber strains, and the (female) floral parts provide most of the essential oil, narcotic strains are naturally adapted to essential oil production.
efforts are underway in europe to add value in the form of processed products for hemp, especially cosmetics and food but, as noted below, the north american market is already quite advanced in oilseed applications.
hemp oil is high in unsaturated fatty acids (of the order of 75%), which can easily oxidize, so it is unsuitable for frying or baking.
third is breeding for specific seed components.
from the individual producer’s perspective, the old adage “find your market before you plant your seed” remains sound advice.
the fibers so that one has a more refined (thinner) hemp fiber that currently is only available from water retting.
tragically this includes some legitimate farmers who, faced with financial ruin because of the unprofitability of crops being grown, converted to growing marijuana.
the netherlands firm hortapharm developed strains of cannabis rich in particular cannabinoids.
in addition to agricultural wastes, there are vast quantities of scrub trees, especially poplar, in northern areas, that can supply large amounts of low-quality wood fiber extremely cheaply.
similarly, limited seed productivity concentrates the plant’s energy into production of fiber, and fiber cultivars often have low genetic propensity for seed output.
gla has been found to alleviate psoriasis, atopic eczema, and mastalgia, and may also benefit cardiovascular, psychiatric, and immunological disorders.
an absence of such fiber-strain traits as tallness, limited branching, long internodes, and very hollow stems, is characteristic of narcotic strains.
hemp and lime mixtures make a high quality plaster.
indeed, the reason hemp cultivation was made illegal in north america was concern that the hemp crop was a drug menace.
top of sessile secretory gland.
however, there is insufficient fiber processing capacity to handle hemp produced in canada.
flax and hemp fibers exposed to water and soil have been claimed to disintegrate rapidly over the course of a few months, which would make them unacceptable for products that need to have long-term stability when exposed to water and oil.
hemp requires about the same fertility as a high-yielding crop of wheat.
in canada, extraordinary yields of 1.5 t/ha have been realized, at least locally, although in the initial years of hempseed development in canada yields were often less than 500 kg/ha.
extensive root systems are key to the ability of hemp crops to exploit deep supplies of nutrients and water.
moreover, in northern areas fast-growing poplars and willows can be grown, and such agro-forestry can be very productive and environmentally benign.
cannabis sativa is a multi-purpose plant that has been domesticated for bast (phloem) fiber in the stem, a multi-purpose fixed oil in the “seeds” (achenes), and an intoxicating resin secreted by epidermal glands.
we have encountered exceptionally vigorous wild canadian plants (fig. 52), and grown wild plants from europe (fig. 53) which could prove valuable.
in theory, therefore, low-thc cultivars do not completely solve the problem of drug abuse potential.
the most important specialty pulp products made from hemp are cigarette paper (fig. 16), bank notes, technical filters, and hygiene products.
there may not even be extant land races of the kind of hemp oilseed strains that were once grown in russia, so that except for a very few very recent oilseed cultivars, there has been virtually no breeding of oilseed hemp.
most significantly, modern selection is occurring with regard to mechanized harvesting, particularly the ability to grow in high density as single-headed stalks with very short branches bearing considerable seed.
this has represented a most untimely setback for a fledgling industry, but at least has had a sobering effect on investing in hemp.
north american capacity for hemp pulp production and value-added processing is much more limited than that of europe, and this industry is negligible in north america.
isolation distances for ensuring that seeds produced are pure are considerable for many plants, and often impractical.
since fiber plants have not generally been selected for narcotic purposes, the level of intoxicating constituents is usually limited.
organic certification is much more reliable in north america than in the foreign countries that offer cheap seeds.
according to an ancient legend (abel 1980), buddha, the founder of buddhism, survived a 6-year interval of asceticism by eating nothing but one hemp seed daily.
the taste is pleasantly nutty, sometimes with a touch of bitterness.
importation of experimental hemp lines (i.e. other than the approved cultivars) requires importation licenses (as well as phytosanitary clearance of the shipment by the canadian food inspection agency), and the importation licenses require an indication that the thc contents are low.
however, saeglitz et al. (2000) demonstrated that the spread of beet pollen is not effectively prevented by hemp hedges.
growing hemp may require addition of up to 110 kg/ha of nitrogen, and 40–90 kg/ha of potash.

an additional extremely significant advantage that domestic producers have over foreign sources is organic production, which is important for the image desired by the hemp food market.
there is also considerable potential for other industries using hemp in the manner that the automobile industry has demonstrated is feasible.
most hemp breeding that has been conducted to date has been for fiber characteristics, so that there should be considerable improvement possible.
from the point of view of world markets, concentrating on oilseed hemp makes sense, because europe has shown only limited interest to date in developing oilseed hemp, whereas a tradition of concentrating on profitable oilseed products is already well established in the us and canada.
figure 2 presents the basic morphology of the species.
“geotextiles” or “agricultural textiles” include (1) ground-retaining, biodegradable matting designed to prevent soil erosion, especially to stabilize new plantings while they develop root systems along steep highway banks to prevent soil slippage (fig. 32); and (2) ground-covers designed to reduce weeds in planting beds (in the manner of plastic mulch).
fiber (i.e. tall) cultivars of hemp were also once used in europe as wind-breaks, protecting vulnerable crops against wind damage.
of course, the high thc in drug cultivars makes these a difficult source of germplasm.
antioxidants in hempseed oil are believed to stabilize the highly polyunsaturated oil, tending to keep it from going rancid.
hemp long fiber is one of the strongest and most durable of natural fibers, with high tensile strength, wet strength, and other characteristics that make it technically suited for various industrial products (karus and leson 1996).
cannabis sativa is known to be exceptionally resistant to pests (fig.

hemp does best on a loose, well-aerated loam soil with high fertility and abundant organic matter.
whole houses have been made based on hemp fiber (fig. 24, 25).
from the point of view of world markets, concentrating on oilseed hemp makes sense, because europe has shown only limited interest to date in developing oilseed hemp, whereas a tradition of concentrating on profitable oilseed products is already well established in the us and canada.
in western europe, the fiber is often “cottonized,” i.e. chopped into short segments the size of cotton and flax fiber, so that the fibers can be processed on flax processing machinery, which is very much better developed than such machinery is for hemp.
however, essential oil in the marketplace has often been produced from low-thc cannabis, and the thc content of essential oil obtained by steam distillation can be quite low, producing a product satisfying the needs for very low thc levels in food and other commercial goods.

admittedly, such advertising works.
cannabis sativa is known to be exceptionally resistant to pests (fig. 51), although, the degree of immunity to attacking organisms has been greatly exaggerated, with several insects and fungi specializing on hemp.
cbd can be converted to thc by acid catalyzed cyclization, and so could serve as a starting material for manufacturing thc.
in france, the principal grower of dual-purpose varieties, the grain is taken off the field first, leaving most of the stalks for later harvest (fig. 49).
in 1999, the year of largest canadian hemp acreage, yields averaged 900 kg/ha.
in this light, subsidy will be denied producers who are growing grain for use in human nutrition and cosmetics.”

several of the cannabinoids are reputed to have medicinal potential: thc for glaucoma, spasticity from spinal injury or multiple sclerosis, pain, inflammation, insomnia, and asthma; cbd for some psychological problems.
for edible purposes, hempseed oil is extracted by cold pressing.
the composition of extracted essential oil is quite different from the volatiles released around the fresh plant (particularly limonene and alpha-pinene), so that a pleasant odor of the living plant is not necessarily indicative of a pleasant-smelling essential oil.

in contrast to shorter-chain and more saturated fatty acids, these essential fatty acids do not serve as energy sources, but as raw materials for cell structure and as precursors for biosynthesis for many of the body’s regulatory biochemicals.
decorticated material (i.e. separated at least into crude fiber) is the raw material, and this is subjected to steam under pressure and increased temperature which “explodes” (separates)
industrial fluids the vegetable oils have been classified by “iodine value” as drying (120–200), semi-drying (100–120), and non-drying (80–100), which is determined by the degree of saturation of the fatty acids present (raie et al. 1995).
