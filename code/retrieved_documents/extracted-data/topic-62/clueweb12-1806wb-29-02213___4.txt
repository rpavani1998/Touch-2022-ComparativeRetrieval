all of my orchids (phals, mini-cymbidiums, & occs) are in an east-facing window over my kitchen sink.
those made for potpouri or votive candles work great for small orchids (i managed to find several dirt cheap at a thrift shop).
binnylou, that's a relief to hear.
a window facing a partial sun might do.
(i should not try to knit, watch tv,  kibbitz with da hubby, and answer online posts at the same time! )
and as also stated, terracotta orchid pots with the little slits in the sides are best for good drainage & aeration.

i lost all my big orchid plants recently and am down to one phaelenopsis which has yet to bloom, but looks nice and healthy.
soil kept  just moist works best; overwatering will yellow & rot them.

my cat just loves to rub up against my orchid!

soil kept just moist works best; overwatering will yellow & rot them.
a good watering and it was perky within a couple of hours.
used as directed, & clipping off the bloom stems once they wither, can have your orchid blooming almost continuously.
they're lovely easy plants - a perfect beginner's orchid.
i'd find it wilted and draped over the pot, down to the floor.
special orchid clay pots have holes and slits all around the pot.
but if i were you, i'd consider that these  orchids are true tropicals, & ice-cold melting water isn't really optimum.

if that pot it is in has a plastic pot inside i would take off the outer pot.
as stated on other posts - well-draining orchid medium is best, which usually consists mostly of shredded bark.

1/4 strength will do ok, in the growing season use porous orchid mix; then you can water/fertilize with about 80 degree warm water, any time of the day, during the growing season.

so if it's indoors, water and/or mist it frequently.
as for the peace lily - bright indirect light works best.
these plants were given as memorials to my sister so i'm hoping to be able  to keep them around.
so it can get fully doused and enjoy the steam and humidity.
as in low light, and watering  only when wilty?
