this will not only look a lot better for your customers, but will also help prevent health issues (bacteria will also build up with the old milk, and could result in diahorrea for your customers).possibly the first step is to acknowledge that there is no such thing as 'perfect', but a high level of skill and ability can be achieved through practise, knowledge and commitment.before training can be considered it is neccesary to choose the staff who will operate your equipment carefully, they must be self motivated, friendly and commited to making great drinks all of the time.instead the fault lies with disintrested staff who have had little or no real training, making them even more disintrested.we supply full barista training with any espresso machines we sell, and on request any of our customers can receive the benefit of pennine's staff expertise for setting up grinders and espresso machines as well as instructions for making drinks.steam arms - cleaning steam arms is essential to make good cappuccino, a build up of caramalised milk on your espresso machine steam arms looks very bad to your customers and it will impair the steaming and foaming ability of your machine.it is a common misconception that to make the best drinks the most expensive or best known brand of espresso machine needs to be purchased, this is false because even the best equipment money can buy will not produce a quality espresso if it has not been set up correctly - before staff training is even considered.note that when you use cleaning solution the plastic handles should be kept above the waterline to stop damage to the plastic.you must find the optimum extraction using your own taste skills, the "crema" quality (it should be light to medium brown, dark brown and speckled indicates an overextraction) and what your own experience says is right.a build up like this will taint the taste and quality of the espresso produced.cleaning with an abrasive pad will damage the steam arm leaving it discoloured.this is why pennine training staff not only have certificates from lavazza uk's training centre to show they have undergone comprehensive training in the fine art of making espresso and cappuccino, but they have years of experience from supplying and installing espresso machines which has fine tuned these skills.routine care of grinders involves cleaning the bean hopper regularly with a soft cloft, and using a soft bristled brush to clean the inside of the ground coffee chamber.filter holders are far too commonly found in the far right state, and if you never bother to seperate the pans from the holder you may never notice how bad they look.to make a great cappuccino you need to want it to be great, if you are not bothered then the drinks produced will be inconsistent and lack the quality your customers demand.
