making improved hd remakes of classics means those fans who want to play ps2 games can get an improved version of them at a reasonable price and those who dont want to play ps2 games dont need to pay more for a feature their not going to use.i own the first four mgs games, but would be very interested in a hd remake of the first three, providing it is proper hd and not what they did with god of war 1+2 and simply re-released the old games and allowed the ps3 to upscale those old textures.they are classic games, bargain price and in their hay day they were great.however, any reworking of kojima-san's much-loved original trio will be music to the ears of playstation nuts, with the games still very much considered classics of the genre.the ps3 did no upscalling whatsoever and you go ahead and put your ps2 copy in and look at how s**t it looks with the ps3 'trying' to upscale i own the first four mgs games, but would be very interested in a hd remake of the first three, providing it is proper hd and not what they did with god of war 1+2 and simply re-released the old games and allowed the ps3 to upscale those old textures.the gow collection is gorgeous,especially god of war ii,it's noticeably different in terms of overall polish/sheen and enhanced audio.if they re-did everything, cutscenes, textures, lighting, shaders etc and released it in a retail boxed version then i would definitely be inclined to pick up a copy.if you did then you would know they did a fantastic job of remastering them into hd, that much so that the graphics were on par with some current gen games.they changed the accents of the women, they just made them all american...which is hardly game breaking.because backwards compatability adds hardware costs for everyone.not that i am a fan of mgs, but this will sell like all hell, probably mostly to people that have gone through them countless times before.only problem is i won't be able to use my action replay to unlock all the weapons and equipment.oh yeah, that'd involve spending a bit, rather than making users pay twice.i am currently enjoying replaying classic games with him.there's always a mention of 'cut-scenes' with talk of any mgs game but people should absolutely not forget the classic gameplay packed into mgs3, which is the most action-packed of the solid series.
