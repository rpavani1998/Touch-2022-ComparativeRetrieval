use gaming to get into people's living rooms and then remove all need for any other device by pushing every form of media onto the xbox."as more and more industry leaders like espn work with us to help monetize their content on xbox live, tv media buyers win with the ability to extend their standard tv spots to this highly engaged consumer audience."i get that people dont like it, but for me, there are far more concerning issues to worry over about our favourite hobby than whether adverts appear on xbox live.psn will not be free forever though, sony are losing money hand over fist and this is one commodity they can make new revenue streams.it's just sad that they are doing this to their consumers.i don't care i'll just vote with my wallet and not use things that advertise ridiculously, if it's just a few i'll do what i always do with adverts, ignore them and continue to buy the products i always have based on service.i mean usually when you pay for membership online it usually removes the advertisements all together (tv is completely different since thats up to the actual channels not the suppliers) yet we don't seem to get anything bar the use of multiplayer gaming and access to apps that require futher spending to use.but now they've got too comfortable and are making stupid moves and wasteful investments on kinect and the ' other entertainment services' when they've completely forgot about the exclusives and the core games that helped them achieved their status.the prominence of adverts on xbox live hasn't gone down well with players, many of whom pay a fee for access to the gold tier of the service.the price of live hasnt went up since ive been using it and they have added tonnes of new content and partnerships compared to what there was at the beginning.sky pays lot of money to buy rights to various channels and to show films etc.big difference between sky paying hundreds of millions a year for content, and ms having some apps, which in turn generate revenue for them anyway.earlier this month a linkedin profile revealed that microsoft aims to 'further monetize' xbox live subscribers and has developed a plan to implement its new strategy by holiday 2012.computerandvideogames.com tamoor plays anything and everything but really likes fighting games.sony have done a pretty good job with keeping a balance between the two.i really, really resent having to pay to play part of a product for which i have already payed over Â£35.
