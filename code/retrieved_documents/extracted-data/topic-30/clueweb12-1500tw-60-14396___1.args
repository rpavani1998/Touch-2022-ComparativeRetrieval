no other hack n' slash game aside from the awesome castlevania: lords of shadow is even worth mentioning, so move aside and make way for the king of the hack n' slash genres return...

if so, nice one i was thinking rdr and the picture could also be fro that time.
i'll play god of war as long as they keep makin em.
i hope it is a new god of war i love these games, would be interesting to see where they could take it aswell now it better be god of war 4 for ps3 and a god of war for vita maybe the vita version is an interqual to show how we get to god of war 4.
the image's filename has found to be called 'gowa_fb' god of war announcement facebook, yeah?
god of war is sony's most beloved franchise, god of war iii is probably the best game ever made and has set records as the most critically acclaimed and best-selling game in the genre of all time, god of war iv will be magnificent.
this same retailer also said a kart racing game based on the littlebigplanet franchise was on the way, and we allknow how that turned out.
few sequels there then eh, be careful to not spill that milk while you're dancing.

ready at dawn, the studio behind the numerous excellent psp god of war titles, recently is currently working on a new project, although it'sbelieved to be for next-gen systems a playstation vita entry in the series could be on the cards too.
enough with this series a vita entry would be perfect.
the characters, the story, the gameplay, the gore eveything !
devil may cry & ninja gaiden were never good and are dead now, god of war is the pinnacle of the genre as it by miles has the best combat, story, graphics, boss fights, difficulty curve, set-pieces, pacing, ost, fun, depth etc,... god of war represents perfection in the genre that none of the other games can come close too.
no not really being playing kinect sports 2, dance central 2, mass effect 3,fruit ninja ,gun-stringer,also will be playing sky rim w/ kinect bug free unlike the ps3 version .
hopefully if it is a gow, it's starting something new like cvg's idea a while ago.
the witcher 2 is just stunning.
that means that it is also a crossover with back to the future considering the time difference.
