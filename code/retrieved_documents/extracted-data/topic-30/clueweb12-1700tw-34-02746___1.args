it's a downloadable track and is rather hard, but very fun to try with some hilarious results on crashing.
hopefully they will arrive soon (i have just had dispatch notification).
evolution's entirely less punishing than before, except for about ten later levels designed for veterans (abandon hope - inferno returns).
i'm sure the viewing angle is different to trials hd, making it more difficult see where the jumps are.
this game has tons of potential - kolbitosfruitjuice needless to say, this game will be awesome - rub3z watch the debut trailer now!
its funny how he can't pronounce "homage" properly as well edit: just noticed i said "right stick" in my original comment.
which misses out the break, which is pretty useful at points.
i'm just caning through the levels, not giving a s**t about my time at this stage (in terms of competing against friends).
well worth 1200 points.
we'll still do these spec ops missions, so long as trials evo doesn't take up the next 6 months sure - also up for 'gears' too although i could be occupied with 'trials' as well (as my points arrived today and already added ).
i also don't like the fact it says 'crash' when you crash.
the review says "it's mastered over dozens of hours, but controls with two buttons - the left stick balances your rider and the right trigger revs.
redlynx have found their creative vein and pumped it full of red bull.
there is certainly a lot of potential game time to be eaten up by this.
i'm excited because trials hd was one of those very few games of late where i literally would not be able to put it down until i fell asleep, my bird at the time got well dry with the lack of attention ...
yeah trials evo was one of the games i never picked up the demo and i always check out a game that comes out on xbla.
well i have my copy - only just scratched the surface of this as i have only completed a few tracks of the single player - still to try any of the user created tracks, multiplayer or other games etc.
the game was improved by about 78% from that point on.
tell me about it, but i can honestly say im happy to be spending this money lol 4 days off from tomorrow.
what with this and fez in the last 5 days, we as xbox gamers are really being spoilt for arcade action!
it's more angled as opposed to more straight on.
being banging out trials hd all day to get in the groove i ordered points from the microsoft store nearly 2 weeks ago specifically for this game and they still haven't arrived yet.

graphically it is better with more going on (though i do miss the closed in feel of some of hd's tracks) and the online is great fun though clearly puniches you if you ain't got the hang of it yet.
the courses are well designed, as expected and the replay value is certainly there.
wasn't impressed by the opening music, so the first thing i did was go to the option and turn the music volume to zero.
got a few mates round last night for the chelsea game and we were on this nearly all night.
only quibble is you can only go public in a group of 2.
did anyone else get to gigatrack, not read the description and then after 10 minutes think 'when the hell is this track gonna end' aye i thought to begin with that i'd broke the track.
already have my 1200 points on my account for tomorrow.
along with accelerator on the right stick gives you the 2 buttons.
i am ecstatic it is finally here, but now i must complete fez tonight...or it'll be left in trials literal dust...
well need to get a leaderboard put up in the xbox forum, the wall of shame agreed loving the game give us an add if you have space be interesting to see how rubbish my scores are so far!
need to def**k my live account first tho supercoss matches are pure brilliance.
anyway, micro donkey all they way - this wee bike whips nearly anything on more challenging tracks and even most trials tracks.
well up for any kind of cvg leaderboard thing or joining multiplayer sessions (not sure how it works yet til i get online later), gamertag is danhalen74 send me a friend request or game invite and watch me flawlessly annihilate myself into 4th place again and again whilst using my behemoth like freakstrength to prop up the leaderboard.....
it's impossible to survive, however, the climax of every course, cartoonish post-track impacts a cathartic surprise after almost unbearable tension.
why wallet is puking money.
we'll still do these spec ops missions, so long as trials evo doesn't take up the next 6 months fez, witcher and this in less than a week.
they arrived this morning and already added - just got to wait now for 'trials' to be available to download sold.
i ordered points from the microsoft store nearly 2 weeks ago specifically for this game and they still haven't arrived yet.
will do genius game, really like the new camera which sits a bit further out and back than the old one and also the camera pans round giving the impression of a track with curves.
there's a nod to limbo, black and white and sharp with saw blades (a few of its gravity shifting puzzles prove an inspiration), and a baseball field where a massive bat smashes you for a home run.
can't wait to get into the editor and get tracks upped......and looking forward to getting some of the users ones too.
players not after cunningly hard platinum medals will crash a lot less, making rides only as frustrating as you want them to be.
i know this wouldnt hold my attention for long, but if i still had a 360 i know id be tempted to buy this.
i can't wait to see how slow i am compared to everyone on else on the leaderboards and the track editor really should throw up some interesting games and tracks.
you slaaaaaaaag it's almost depressing to think the last game was set exclusively in a scrap-filled warehouse which had players leaping over mdf planks likesome kind of stig of the jump can i just say this is the best pun i've read on cvg, well done points at the ready and i'm off work tomorrow.
wily new ways to main you aside, there's good news for players who in the last game smacked their heads on a harsh 'pro's only' barrier.
developers redlynx hasn't changed the physics a jolt since their 2009 two million-seller trials hd, and thank god for that because it's technically perfect.
the graphics are nice and the physics have (thankfully) been left as they were.
overall though i'm sure i'll plough hours into it and it is a bargain for 1200 points 4 players on the same system is a right laugh and just as much fun as 4 player wrecked.
havn't bought a game on live arcade in a while, this is a must have though.
only played the trial (heh) for this, but i didn't think it was as good as trials hd.
one 'bike-tality' sucks you down a pipe and pumps you ass-down on a bathroom stall, while another locks on via periscope and fires two torpedoes your way.
oxm reviewer didn't seem overly impressed and only awarded it an 8 but didn't really talk about anything other than the single player....
loved the first one and this looks to be even better.
and i know how i'm going to spend it....though to be fair i'm just spoiling myself having got fez and witcher this week (amazing game yo) this is going to be very popular - i wonder if xbox live will go under....hope it can wait until i get my copy... cant.......wait......
the ~limbo track is genius, as is rollercoaster, gigantus and the one in the clouds.
lot's to do as always although the tracks are generally easier i think than in the first.
remember that as you tear through 57 tracks ranging from countryside rides- nothing more taxing than a few steep hills - to wooden roller coasters a mile up, a constantly rotating vertiginous playground and collapsing scaffolding that spirals up an ancient castle.
like real life, there's no jump button; getting airborne is a case of rider positioning, momentum and trajectory.
hahaha - i did the same thing yesterday and strangely enough i got a dispatch notification soon afterwards (and yes it was the easter voucher code thing and yes 4200 points).
be getting it once it hits a sale though.
he also says that you can't make your own skill games in the video review, which is also wrong, although i think he corrects himself.

i loved trials hd so much and after seeing all the new content, global sharing and robust editor in evo i picked it up no question.
it's mastered over dozens of hours, but controls with two buttons - the left stick balances your rider and the right trigger revs.
either way i can't wait to download and play this - definitely the best xbla game to date and probably better than a lot of full price big budget games too!!!
trial hd, at this stage, imo, is better.
i'm excited because trials hd was one of those very few games of late where i literally would not be able to put it down until i fell asleep, my bird at the time got well dry with the lack of attention
it's nice to know that despite complex design, nothing is taken too seriously.
to shift, bunny hop and throttle through fiendishly fantastic gauntlets made infinitely more exciting thanks to utterly inspired design and doubly inspired handling.
