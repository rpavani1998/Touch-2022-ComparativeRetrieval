my ps3 fatboy, fine my ps3 slim i traded up to, after 2 years the power supply is failing, crap.
and if ps4 is released around the same time, hopefully the consoles will both be competitavely priced talking about abysmal ps3 hardware reliability, first of all and secondly, in a xbox thread ps3 is reliable.
i could keep going on with things like how the ps3 controller can only be charged when the ps3 is on therefore leaving out my keyboard again etc.
(don't frett double the cpu cores fx 6100, double the ram for games, quadruple the ram for the system and background processes.
so future games can go wild whilst not having to deal with multiple discs.
6- better xbox live functionality and much more entertainment like streaming tv channels...
4- less expensive (around the cost of a slim these days, so more people would buy it).
by tom ivan for computerandvideogames.com the next generation xbox will launch in 2013, according to a cnet source said to be working within microsoft's xbox team.
possible disk with large slow read files to install to hdd from disk.
in the days of consoles when you just putting a cartridge or disc into the thing and of you played, they where great.
i'm not saying games are exactly the same, because they're not, but for series games especially it's like they are running out of ideas.
but they didn;t want the same thing happening next time with there "competitors" getting a large headstart.
judging from the friendly banter on the boards these days i'd say most are f**king having one.
it's annoying to have a wireless controller and yet you rely on the wire most of the time.
you may tire one day of thinking up inventive new usernames, but you will never tire of trolling xbox articles.
what i meant was, i like to keep my things in one place and don't want to keeping putting stuff lying around on the side looking a mess.
yeah, nowt against my peers here but i'll listen to developers before forum members and the dev feedback is rather positive, to say the least.
eclipse: the gap between wii u and 720/ps4 will be a fraction of what the gap is between 360/ps3 and wii.
leave the normal folk to talk.
because it can't be the games seeing as this year was easily the best year this gen.
i hope it is as well made as the xbox360 s which is just a brilliant console, very well made, looks amazing too.
my 360 slim, hasn't skipped a beat in 11 months, it's as reliable as the ps3 fatboy and is much quieter then the ps3 slim, it is the best console i have owned out the lot.
now are consoles update, install like a pc, why not go back to the good old days of home computers.
my uncle still has his launch day 360... doesn't make them reliable just because a few people still have one working.
emma williams, who led the launch of the new xbox 360 dashboard as general manager of xbox experiences, has apparently assumed coyner's former position.
i think it will just transfer over like it did with the 360 from original xbox.
only fools buy new hardware at launch because most launch titles are crap.
if sony chose to put the power brick on the outside, they may not have failed at all.
if you want to see a new console have a look at a top end pc now, and then add windows 8, and kinect hey presto xbox720.

the pc would not be like it is today if it was not for the home computers like the amiga and atari sound and graphics capabilities of its time.
he'll sign in as english schmuppet again and you'll love him.
my most recent 360 is actually now a fully-functioning doorstop and i gotta admit its been a lot more reliable in this role than it ever was at playing games.
yes i can keep p**sing about with swapping wires around all the time but there shouldn't be any need to.
i don't care about costs of consoles if i think it's worth the money and has games then i'll buy it.
besides, if you were 10 years older than me then you should be embarrassed!
it can't be that weak, all of a sudden ms and sony seem to be falling over themselves to catch up.
so i will use it seeing as the ps3 is poorly designed in a way that the solder joints melt on the cpu and gpu chips.
while i'm excited for the next generation i can't help but think we haven't experienced all this generation has to offer yet.
it would also defeat the whole point of 'wii u' offering traditional games and control method for the 'u' part.
most of that sh*t should be fired in the cupboard if you're that worried about mess.
it's just an inconvenience for me and i would like the option for extra ports.
very tedious, especially as it's about the one thing it won't be called.
ste and i really hope nintendo have learnt alot of lessons from the wii and their recent 3ds mistakes/shortcomings.
fun for all the family fun for all the family my uncle larry used to say that about himself and wink as well.
i don't want to see hardware failure on the level of ps3 again it was abysmal.
yes i know but just because few have had their's replaced doesn't mean they aren't reliable.
sony do shaft you if something goes wrong, i had my consoles repaired free of charge by ms until my 3 year warranty ran out last year, free collection and return delivery, vs my friend who has had 3 blu ray drives on his original console replaced at his own cost at 100 a pop and then having to buy another ps3 slim.
just don't be a tit and accept that not everyone uses their ps3 the same as you.
i'll believe it when i see it from an official ms pr spokesman/woman.
spending a tiny little bit more and putting 4-6gb of ram instead of 2gb could significantly lengthen the lifespan of the console.
i just think my comments have got right up royston's microsoft loving arse and there's not room in there for both me and the rumblepak.
alls i'm saying is that it would be nice to have extra usb ports seeing as sony has made the ps3 compatible with so much stuff.
they can charge for anything else
i want to be able to carry my gt and achievement score over to the new xbox.
and a "custom" gpu based off a hd6850 card, you can pick up both a fx 6100 & a hd6850 for £229 and that's not buying in bulk like microsoft will.)
i'm sure xbox 720 will come with some kind of kinect camera straight out of the box, so nintendo will really have to get a good footing to compete and have the processing power available to continue to compete for the coming 5-6 years.
your comments are not jokes but flamebait.
as for sony, the mistake of making ps3 a tech heavy as it is still haunts their finances today.
the difference is that you have a proven history of fanboy comments.
whoever makes the best hardware next gen will be the one i will buy.
erm, i appear to be 10 years older than your lil teenage self.
3) no heat will put a stop to that, unless they go for a very weak system.
i don't know anyone that isn't on their 2nd ps3 unless they are recent owners.
doesn't need stupid bolt on fans, and that's with the power brick internalised,and being a smaller unit than the 'slim' 360... and that's not even counting the power brick... or the billions dollars wasted on repairing abysmal hardware and chronic flaws.
doesn't make them reliable just because a few people still have one working.
plus with the next generation of games probably retailing at £50+ i expect to be able to play the game online without having to pay anything extra if i buy the game new.
before buddah you went under the alias of ps3 prince.
i thought it implemented loads of ads and launched with technical issues.
what we need: 1- around 4gb of ram- that would give the console a much longer life span and will allow much more things on screen (more enemies, bigger maps, and prettier in general).
but anyway bring em on all i say - i want full hd 1080p 60fps in all games and also maybe the extra ram would make skyrim work on ps3 (4)
because look at the ps3 slim, such an inferior machine compared to the launch models!
(and i could go on easily) also ea are meant to be working on a battlefield game for wii u that isn't 3.
he'd be 57 this year if the police hadn't finally shot and killed him during the chase when he made a run for mexico.
if the xbox 720 is released in 2013 and is released over a year before the ps4 then its got my vote.
and let's hope sony release ps4 in that year as well because even though this gen is amazing and we have amazing games to play, it's time to move forwards.
i do hope when it is released it is very powerful, lots of ram and a strong gpu, ai chip would be amazing and a physics chip.
@ grolsch if they charge for psn it would ruin the psn+ service ppl will not pay for 2 things psn will allways be free a 2013 release seems quite likely though i'm not sure we'll see the ps3's successor quite so soon.
that is going to be very important for even more expensive next-gen production values.
both the xbox and ps3 are flawed machines and are looking so ancient now.
periods is what arsehole women get.
what audience ms is going for though is anybody's guess.
cnet source said to be working within microsoft's xbox team well surly after speaking out like this they won't be working within the team anymore !
that way your more prepared both hardware wise and software wise.
oh and i forgot to say i also have my printer hooked up for printing photos and stuff off as that's where i keep my photos.
they were kind enough to give me the rundown you just read.
with xbox live being built up as a service with all of these extras apps being added, ms now wanting to get into the living room which was bill gate's vision all those years ago having one device controlling everything you do.
then i've got my mouse, external hdd, usb dongle for dj hero, dongle for the 3rd party controller that is shaped like a 360 pad, move controller chargers.
but as i have had my hands burnt with the 360, 7 consoles so far, i will wait this time and see how the new console shapes up in terms of reliability , and anyhow there are 1000+ games for the 360 so it will keep you going for a few more years yet.
apart from my headphones and keyboard, because i use both all of the time.
until then these daily nextbox/ps4 rumours are getting very tiresome (even more so than the daily 6 minimum mw3/battlefield 3 stories that we've been subjected to over the second half of the year).
i would also point out that the tard above gives as good as he gets and pretty much gets involved at every opportunity - before me he was obsessed with this jboo it seems.
he got called out for being somebody called ps3 fannyboy or somebody by a poster that knew him.
but you also have to accept not everyone uses their ps3 like you and needs 6+ usb ports.
i really am perplexed how you can allow neo_superman and julioaragon to relentlessly troll every ps3 thread but resolutely ban me every time i poke a bit of light-hearted fun at the 360?
3- less massive (around the size of the slim if not smaller).
i've got a external usb adapter for my ps3 because the slim only has 2 which is just pathetic at this day and age.
this should also help the current gen consoles sell more with a hefty price drop!
but you could also spend less time beating an old horse and more time being creative with a younger one i suppose microsoft is going to unify windows 8 with the xbox (8box?) which will make game developemnt and portability cheaper also.
if wii u isn't at the very least sitting somewhere in the middle of these two generations then i fail to see it's appeal to current 360/ps3 owners with the new consoles coming within a year of wii u launch.
that way i don't have to have my console on when recharging and i don't have a pile of silly looking wires hanging from my console.
of course providing we don't get more games like crysis that run poorly on new graphics cards, and having to wait 1-2 years for a card powerful enough to run it 60+ fps with little/no slowdown again.
if this is true then the wii u specs will need to be closer to the upcoming 720/ps4 models instead of being at a lower scale offering a slight improvement on current 360/ps3 5+ year old tech.
sure, a lot of forum members have butno dev has once said "not happy, can't do much here" ea are happy, as are crytek, acti, ubi, square, tecmo, etc...gearbox have already stated that colonial marines will run textures never before seen on a console and on and on.
sure a few extra wires won't do any damage.
my thoughts exactly, no one will buy halo 4 if ms announce a new console, so i think a reveal at e3 2013 or late 2012 will be more likely.
no not going to happen gamers will have to be installed to the hdd.
in my opinion, any rumours still banging on about a 2015 release date are alot sillier than any with a 2013 release date.
it's got to be 6 minimum, i'm currently using 7 usb ports.
all of my friends have suffered from this s**tty hardware failure, i've spent £700 on hardware so i aren't taking my chances.
all peripheral devices should be totally wireless with a recharge method separate from the console.
emma williams, who led the launch of the new xbox 360 dashboard as general manager of xbox experiences, has apparently assumed coyner's former position.
cooling stand headphones controller charger mic charger keyboard dongle playtv box playstation eye toy that's the stuff i want plugged in all the time.
i don't limit my hatred to ps3 fanboys but any blatant troll such as jjthegame who is a massive xbot who loves to bad mouth the ps3 at any given time.
i just hope they hurry up and name the ruddy thing so that people stop calling it 'xbox 720'.
no, the cpu and gpu produce plenty of heat.
so we don't get s**tty ports again off the lazy developers.
no messing with settings, installs, updates etc.
doesn't need stupid bolt on fans, and that's with the power brick heat source internalised,and being a smaller unit than the 'slim' 360... and that's not even counting the power brick... or the billions dollars wasted on repairing abysmal hardware and chronic flaws.
as for marginally more powerful than this gen, i'm yet to hear a dev complain or say anything that would validate that viewpoint.
also make the system much easier to program for!!
i said i think the ps4 will be two ps3s duck taped together hmm, this begets a difficult situation.
but let's use dj hero 2 as an example, i'm getting that soon so if i only had 2 usb ports then i'd be stuck with just my dj hero and headphones plugged in.
so sony/microsoft a ps4 720 computer, programmable with a keyboard and mouse (padlet).
anyway, i'm still utterly impressed with my 360 slim and the new dashboard and apps are ace, i am just really hoping for iplayer now but doesn't look like it will get it
more articles being printed on this only taking the stance of 'more silly rumours of 2013 release'.
i could add more things, i dont want to keep pulling and inserting usb leads and dongles wearing the ports out, not just that i like to keep all the clutter tidy.
multiple sources also informed the tech site that there's a new face responsible for xbox brand and design leadership as microsoft moves towards launching xbox 360's successor.
maybe abysmal is the wrong word, 360 is abysmal, infact that console needs a stronger word.
does the guy even own a ps3 cos i have both platforms and play them both regularly.
that is the biggest flaw with the ps3 stopping it from being as awesome as it could have been.
the only thing which would put me at ease would be if they reanimated steve jobs or employed lord kutaragi to design the 720 tbh.
i did use it at some point though taking up another usb port.
hardware reliability is top of the list for me.
i know i used to be much worse but nothing i've said recently is any worse than others on here post daily.
also if you're going to make a beast of a machine then don't be retarded and skimp out on ram!!!
with all the money microsoft have, im hoping they will call it something better then "xbox 720" and im also hoping they drop the "xbox" name too.
as you say this has been possibly the best year for games to which i'd agree with but i don't feel new games are as exciting as they once were.
almost positive you don't play dj hero anymore... and probably half of that stuff.
they can forget a 10 year lifecycle if they don't go for at least 4gb.

let's hope ms make a proper machine this time like the awesome s model that should have been there from launch rather than the cheap piece of crap that was released in 2005 without any important basic features and one that was so cheap it had a spectacular failure rate that only the worst hardware companies could achieve.
my original 360, first one failed after 3 months, replacement second machine was dead out of the box with red ring, the third one i then got began scratching dvd's after about 8 months.
now if that's not trying to call me out i don't know what is... admit it, you have an intrinsic grudge against any sony fan who is a little more than outspoken.
the integrated xbox live service launched in november 2002 allowed players to play games online.
the whole games need huge storage has always been sony pr spin skyrim is 6gb, it's the system not the disk that allows games to "go wild".

yes, because setting your age on a forum is definitely legit.
to internalise it alland have a much better reliability record was/is a feat.
as for sony, let's get some basics this time like cross game chat and a better psn service, charge for it if you must to make it better.
i know dice have dev kits at the moment at the very least.
talking about abysmal ps3 hardware reliability, first of all and secondly, in a xbox thread ps3 is reliable.
1) not going to happen, 2gb ddr 3 @ 1333mhz to run the os & background processes, and 1gb gdrr5 for games.
i hope this gen hasn't put sony and ms off building a machine with all the extras included.
may be the case that i'm tempted into a shamefaced purchase of the 720.
i think it would be better to hold off the new consoles for another couple of years so the drastic hike in performance we've seen between the other generations can be just as apparent in the coming generation.
i'll be more looking forward to a powerful 512bit nvidia gpu a year from now looks like i'll be getting next gen gaming early!.
and it would steal thunder from nintendo and sony then too.
along with cooling stand which is completely unnecessary.
with the big chips they start out on, they will be less reliable be nature, but ms's problem just keep perpetuating.
seeing how cheep usb ports are there really isn't any excuse to use just 2, at least give me the option to pay extra.
either that or i'll just have to make do with a vita - i'm convinced it's a serious enough platform to fulfil each gaming genre i'm likely to play.
the whole reason you got perma-banned in the first place.
i have owned my ps3 since just after launch and it is still going strong.
this gen's still going strong and i've got a lot of great games i can catch up on, meanwhile the new consoles can build up a library and maybe drop in price.
port for charging the controller when it's not being charged, yes.
i either want devs to dial down the graphics or for sony/ms to bring out a new console soonish (or the wii u), as both consoles struggle to keep 30fps a lot of the time without tearing, on multiplatform games especially.
personally endless fps and racing games don't appeal much to me but if nintendo are pitching the wii u as a console that can be a jack of all trades then they better hope it doesn't end up being a master of none.
touch wood lol the only rule i've had when it comes to buying a consoles is to wait one year after they come out, most of the issues of the machine are ironed out (most, not all.
and a possible nand cartridge with all fast files that need the data transfer rate, no more texture pop-in.
as it happens the cooling stand is a laptop cooling stand and it works a treat.
know a few phats that have went kaput.
i think the difference in power between the machines won't be as big as some people seem to think.
everyone i know that has gamed on the ps3 from the start are all on their 2nd console.
we have seen the best this gen can offer and it is the pc version.
right on the sequels, microsoft will push the live service as they do now, and in the process force siverlight on the mobile sector.
i'd dare say out of the 50mil sold, 10mil are all replacement consoles.
if they charge for psn it would ruin the psn+ service ppl will not pay for 2 things psn will allways be free everything that is free now will always be free, but that doesn't stop them adding all new features of psn to psn+ only.
talking about abysmal ps3 hardware reliability, first of all and secondly, in a xbox thread just because the 360 is the worst hardware we've ever seen in a console, reliability wise, does not mean that the ps3 is ok having poor hardware reliability just because it doesn't look to bad compare to 360 talking about abysmal ps3 hardware reliability, first of all and secondly, in a xbox thread ps3 is reliable.
oh, and voodoo, that name won't crop up again, as it was banned ages ago.
i think the 360 is maxed out now, although i think the ps3 still has room to grow, but i think 'the last of us' will show us what can really be done on the machine.
that for me us s**t, along with the fact all my friends are on 2nd ps3s.
before u guys come down on a pile of bricks lol), theres a slight price reduction, theres more games out.
of course the 5+year old console technology can still release gems
it makes better business sense to announce it at e3, the worlds biggest games expo.
no still cheap £350ish at the expense of top of the range components.
yes it will run a light version of windows 8, the 2gb sytem ram will allow for all that non-gaming crap, again at the expense of console exclusives.
they would be daft not to considering how cheap ram is these days.
if it is hugely inferior in processing power you will not get the same multi-platform games anyway, thus yet again loosing out on a massive part of the gaming market.
