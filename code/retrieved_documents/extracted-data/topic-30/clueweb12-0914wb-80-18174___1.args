if you missed monday's shock news, cvg exclusively reported that the firm's highly anticipated xbox 360 rpg mass effect has been pushed back to september.
this rumor is utter bunk thanks to the extra crap added onto it.
i refuse to pay for a game, pay for live and then pay a monthly fee to play it.
i've read that article and it didn't convince me that it hasany basis.
getting a bit bored of wow.
and essentially there wouldnt be so much work involved as it would be an evolution rather than a game built from scratch, for me the ui, game and character mechanics were spot on in kotor 2 the skills systems and character development

i think that this new is a desire made real if we think in the more number of players.
kotor is one of our favourite star wars games ever and the thoughts of an online mmo is, frankly, too much to take in.
by the way, we have launched a wiki knowledge base that will be continuously enriched with information about biowares's upcoming next-generation mmo.

you kotor fans have nothing to worry about.
nooooooooo don't turn it into another pay monthly game.
i am actually looking forward to this news, unlike the 6 people that hate this news.
mass effect will bring in more money than they could possibly wish for.
the sad thing about most mmorpgs is that they're just glorified co-op sp games (like nwn), but with lots of strangers running around.
the current pc-exclusive dragon age is coming to ps3 and the ds currently in development at the mega-studio looks to be from the baldur's gate franchise.
anyways the point is its there company not yours if they want to make a kotor mmorpg then they will they don't give a s**t about who doesn't want to see it made because they know that they will make millions if they make it so sit there and cry because it is deffenitly going to be made.
hopefully this is true kotor is one of the best games on the xbox if not the best and this would be a great games on the xbox360 and hopefully soon to follow on the pc the timeframe is perfect they dont hav a specific guidline it gives the devs lots of freedom look what they did with the first kotor classic this one will definetly b a great game my only worry is storage and space for the devs to work with i jus hope they have a base thats full of content then post the things they couldnt include on the game for online play on xbox live content so we can get a good feel of the game this is great news lets just hope that this news will be announced by bioware oh god!
today, despite of some coments here, the solo rpgs are dead.
i need a replacement for wow. lol, thats true, well, they should make it for the pc anyway, most games are made for the pc as the pc is almost considered as a next-gen type console thing, umm that came out a bit wrong.
more importantly, the license for baldur's gate as a franchise is still owned by interplay - the same interplay thatstill owe bioware money for unpaid royalties for baldur's gate ii - and the forgotten realms license is with atari.
only because i don't want to see it turn into one of those games that gets to like kotor xvi where the game will be the same as the last on with just a new face and new names.
mmo's rarely have a decent story or anything like that... and if its pay montly i'll never by a title by bioware ever...
i desperately hope this news isn't true.
if you missed monday's shock news, cvg exclusively reported that the firm's highly anticipated xbox 360 rpg mass effect has been pushed back to september.
an mmo could never be as good as a sp rpg.
i want kotor 3 singleplayer please.. looking fwd to mo news on this one......could be a killer game
these games will all be out when they're done.
this is coming from someone who has played mmos, the community is generally horrible, the gameplay is almost as bad, and they don't have a thing on single player rpgs.
so if they get finished with mass effect, they'll move that district onto another project (or split up the current team, and move so-and so to work on one project, and so and so to work on another project. )
a 10 year old who thinks hes so great and knows everything about the game.
bioware have been adamant that dragon age is a pc game.
anything bioware touches, will turn to gold.
if there is a kotor mmorpg making by bioware.
no further details were reported in the rumour section of the us magazine but we've taped our fingers crossed.
actually, kotormmofowin proves my point.
but if anyone one can sort out this genre then obsidian would be one of the two possible companys i would like to see do it (thq the other one).
not that i think on-line game is bad idea.
secondly, if it would be only mmo then i'd say 'hell no! '.
i loved the kotor games but making it into a mmo would ruin it for me.
i am a huge fan of the kotor games and would love to see a kotor mmo.
kotor is one of our favourite star wars games ever and the thoughts of an online mmo is, frankly, too much to take in.
if they discover the new game ways, then, they will love the online and they never will play conventional games in the future.
and with the mmo problem, i personaly do not know anything about mmo.
if done correct, then only 6 people will probably protest it.
so i do not have have anything wrong with it, but i loved the way kotor i & kotor ii was made.
also dragon age (also mentioned in the rumor) is also a brand new ip.
they're all rumours at the moment but we'll keep you updated with any announcements.
while bioware are creating a new mmorpg (they've opened new offices specifically for this project)
bioware's online team tipped to be working on massively multiplayer knights of the old republic console title share
possibly the only game i'd get the 360 for gone in a puff fof smoke because of greed.
kotoriii could be immense, but an mmo would be your biggest mistake ever.
being made by a seperate district of bioware; no resources ('cept money) being drained.
first of all, i think this news stinks.
i think kotor would suck as an mmo becuase in mmo's all you do is try to be better than your friends but if there was a seperate kotor based mmo thats fine but kotor is ment to be a sigle playernot ment to be a frikin mmo im a big fan kotor as any of you
they have enough money from kotor, and jade empire, and nwn and nwn2, and baldur's gate to pool in ths type of move.
thay will take up a lot of time, plus we might have to pay phantasy star like money to play it.
bioware are totally done with baldur's gate.
its true that most of the current mmorpgs tend to be quite shallow in game content, reyling instead on player interaction to satisfy gamers needs.
with the multiplayer mode thing, it's not a bad, but i would rather have a single mode to go with it.
kotor is a dazzling timeline for the sw universe, and, with an sw galaxies being almos ancient, this is the time for the bioware rumor made real, i think.
if this is done right this could be the best mmo ever made!
i loathe mmorpgs with a passion, and the thought of one of my favourite developers wasting their skills, time, and money on some pos on-line game when they could be making a proper rpg (i.e. kotor 3, *single player only*) instead is a highly unpleasant one.
these rumors are nearly complete rubbish.
it's a much safer option, mmo's always turn out to be disasters.
i'd love to see you 6 in the game, sitting in the corner, holding up 'sayno to kotor online' while millions of others walk you by and ignore you.
something i've noticed is all the people saying no to this are most likely thinking this is a substitute for kotor 3, it's not, this is a completely separate game, an online version of kotor that will have hardly anything to do with the characters already in the kotor games, kotor 3 will still be made and by obsidian, though it's not official yet it's not that hard to see that obsidian think that sw: kotor is a goldmine, sw kotor
no doubt we'll be charged a ridiculous recurring fee on a monthly basis.
theres even guilds already forming.www.kotor3mmo.com anyone who is posting that they shouldn't make kotor an mmo needs to grow up.
that's how big mmo's of a great genre are.
and more importantly, the whole thing about baldur's gate pretty much consigns the rumor to the rubbish heap.
you sit at your computer and talk about how this would ruin the other two games but tell me how would it ruin them its not like when the game comes out those two games will change.
mmorpgs are the domain of developers who are too lazy/talentless to come up with good storyline ideas and write decent dialogue.
the magazine also reports on a few other bioware-related rumours.
i played star wars galaxies for some crazy reason and i met probably 5 decent people - everyone else was really rude and disrespectful.
well, thats what i don't understand, if they are making kotor online, it won't take over the kotor sp games, its separate, it won't have anything to do with kotor 1, 2 or 3 (when it gets made), it will be a separate story with hardly any relation to the sp games, so it won't matter if they make it because, it won't take over the original kotor games we all know and love, so thats why i don't see why people won't give it a chance, the point is if you don't want to play it, then don't, it's a as simple as that, it's just star wars in the old republic, in my opinion, they should make more games in the kotor era and not just leave it to a sp rpg trilogy (i hope for a trilogy), anyway thats my daily rant over, lol.
personally i think that the single player kotor should stop at 2.
even if ea were to force their hand and make them put it on consoles, it wouldn't be ps3-exclusive.
ok yeah, they could use the time it would take for to make this for something else but, there are gonna be the millions of people who play online games (like me) that wants to play kotor online, quite frankly it actually takes longer to make a single player rpg than it does to make an mmo, so time wise doesn't really matter as much, just think of it this way, its another kotor game that just happens to be online, and if its better than swg and wow then i imagine it could be the best online game that could ever of been made, just because you don't want to pay money to play a game after you've already bought it doesn't mean it isn't good, or because you might not have a fast enough broadband to play it, it is just after all another game and swg is getting on now and there needs to be another sw mmo thats gonna take over swg, and sw kotor online is definitely the way to go.
i'd like to see your proof that they aren't making it, normally i don't listen to rumors either, but when bioware have heard the rumor and not deny it, thats when i decided that they may be making it, so unless you have proof stated by bioware they are not making a sw kotor online, then i think you shouldn't post such a bold statement that you have no idea is true.
the kotor games were excellent, and if obsidian were able to transfer that kind of quality onto the online world then it would be a major coup.
although i love kotor, i would much rather have a brand new single player rpg that has absolutely nothing to do with star wars than a kotor mmorpg.
there's not many signatures because it hasn't got any publicity, i think.
stargate worlds and kotoronline will jus tbe the topping of the cake.
if this story is true, i've just lost all interest.
online will be different, the story is practicaly made by the player and will be just basically a revamped swg, but in the kotor era, where there are more sith and more jedi, so i say definitely yes, this is what i have wanted since i first played kotor 1, and also the people who don't want this, quite simply put, "don't play it" duh.
kotor mmo would be the best thing ever.
kkthnx kotor mmo lovin guy i really like the news of kotor iii a lot.
they're all rumours at the moment but we'll keep you updated with any announcements.
kotor 3 will contribute to that as well.
it will not be based on the star wars universe, it's going to be a brand new ip.
no one can really affect the world, however.
the people who says no to the idea of a mmo on kotor prefering the conventional rpg, is because they have never played online yet.
we will taste the best star wars experience ever.
even if this mmorpg isn't "instead of" kotor 3, it will still use up time and resources that could have gone into developing at least one single player game instead.
the current pc-exclusive dragon age is coming to ps3 and the ds currently in development at the mega-studio looks to be from the baldur's gate franchise.

when i heard this rumour it practically wrecked my day.
i would spend hours just listening to their stories and backgrounds.
to reddit submit article to del.icio.us submit article to digg submit article
so i really would just wish that you not that i hate this at all, but i real wished that who ever created kotor ii restore it to the way it was met to be played alittle more than kotor iii.
they have more than enough talent and money to work on all those.
i thought that the best part of the past games was interacting with the rest of your party.
if there were a singleplayer part, at least as good as the earlier games and an mmo side of the game, i'll say ok.
love the kotor universe and if this was done properly but for pc aswell this would rock.
