great machine, the old xbox, led the way in online gaming, and gave us much needed competition for the stale playstation brand, which, even now struggles to keep up, especially online.
it was the variety of games too on ps2, with many cult classics that weren't block busters such as okami.. i.actually preferred my gamecube to the ps2, but its library was phenomenal.and - report this post reply with quote ingy on 14 mar '12 said: at the time it was just doing everything right, compared to the ps2 anyway great online service great controller great graphics great games unified headsets, that worked with no problems, and always the promise that things were going to get bigger and better.

if you've got one of microsoft's consoles, this little lot should make you very happy this year.

its interesting kit, but lacks the games to back up the clever tech.

the original xbox was great kit, but not very popular outside us and it lacked many killer exclusives unlike ps2, but fair play to them for managing it.
don't like racing games and rpg's, and agree halo was awesome, but can't say series kept me interested, with 3 and reach being lackluster imo.

i still prefer my ps3 and the exclusives on that system, but theyve been a great influence on industry in many ways, and no doubt brought with them things i not keen on too.
i still applaud what theyve achieved either way project gotham racing, splinter cell, halo, knights of the old republic , these immediatly spring to mind as exclusives, not bad me thinks, but there were plenty more.
i think the kinnect thing took too much focus away from what made the 360 great.
very disappointing - report this post reply with quote kirankara on 14 mar '12 said: having owned the original xbox and a very early 20gb 360, i never thought ms would be as successful as theyve been.
