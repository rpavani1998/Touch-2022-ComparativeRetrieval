the console itself will probably be a lot cheaper to produce, and so will probably draw buyers by buying the console, and then they have no choice but to buy the understandably expensive games.even digital downloads are immune to piracy, itunes is currently the main source for high quality hdtv rips in the piracy scene.that would allow ms to keep check and control of who has first hand games and who doesn't.this would also imply no moving parts to console ruling out many avenues of failure and allow consoles to regain some green credentials as these types of format use much less power than conventional hdds or the power used to spin, read and translate discs.as long as prices aren't bat s**t crazy like they currently are on consoles then it's all good digital distribution is a good thing, and alot of people are using it more and more as time goes on ...on the surface that logical argument seems to make sense, but it runs afoul of the same issue that the current anti-piracy enthusiasts do time and time again: not being able to pirate a game does not automatically mean there will be an increase in sales.and pre-owning could be reduced by making it so when a game is played on a console, it can only ever be played on that console, unless you pay for some unlock, when a disc can not be modified, it's the console itself that remembers if a game has been played, the cartridge could easily have modifiable parts.you'll need at least 512gb if you're storing all your games on them, the benefits of ssd would be wiped out by the relatively massive cost - a regular 500gb drive is about Â£60.i have unlimited broadband, i use steam and have a s**t load of games on it, my hard drive handles them fine and downlaoding new games is quick enough.any disk can have a read error, theyre caused by marks, scratches etc on the bottom of the disk.the site claims the console will "offer compatibility with some sort of interchangeable solid-state card storage, although it is not known whether this will be proprietary or a more standard format such as sd".while it hasn't impacted the console gaming world (yet) in quite the way it has impacted the pc gaming world, requiring online connectivity to activate and play a game (even constant internet connectivity - i'm looking at you ubisoft) isn't unheard of even now.faster read/write speeds, no used games, much more expensive games, very little piracy.as other people have mentioned without a disc drive there's less to go wrong (my brother constantly complains that his 360 can't read a number of his games - he had an awful time with a new copy of saint's row 3 not working properly) and it also would read the data considerably faster.i get to watch films in the best quality without having to purchase yet another device for the living room.
