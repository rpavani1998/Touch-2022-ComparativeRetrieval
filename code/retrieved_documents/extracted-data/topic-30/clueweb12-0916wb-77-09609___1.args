which makes the fact that it's horrendously short and pretty easy (even for me) rather disarming.
the difference is, this time, epic's had an extra year to ferment its engine juices, which means more polish and less filler - even if it does insist on (briefly) revisiting the vehicle sections we've begged it to stop making since the original.
but i just think uncharted 3 could be an exceptional case - it really does look unbelievable, and i have complete faith that naughty dog will provide the goods.
i love how they added women finally in this one.
the battles are big, the environments gorgeous and every now and then somebody says "f***" as a nasty looking baddy smashes through the nearside wall.
he also had 30 mins on bf and said, well, i won't say as it may be controversial beast mode is pretty epic.
for pc gamers with no consoles, they lose out.
i don't think you can expect to get those extra high scores (i.e. 9.5 etc) on the third game in four/five years in a series where the game hasn't really changed very much and you're just shooting slightly different enemies in environments that look slightly different.
also i think it has a difficulty level too, though i am so delighted with the whole game i haven't properly started paying attention finished my first playthrough of the campain last night, i have to say it blows the other two right out of the water.
if games are ever gonnareally hold company with films and books, we need to stop saying that s**te like the gears of war story is any good; it is not.
(mainly because uncharted is better than gears.)
so, how many blow jobs did cvg get from epic to attach such a score to the game...
get it next year when the price drops so at least then if you don't enjoy it, you'll know you didn't waste that much money!
in fact there's a new enemy faction in town; the glowing, mutated lambent that enjoy nothing more than appearing out of the ground via gigantic enemy-spewing stalks - and they're about to rock the boat (literally in this case).
"laughs and tragedy", i sincerely hope that that means that the tragedy of a character that cole is gets eaten and we get to laugh and shoot at a literal s**t stain that he was at some stage!!
as you'll remember from the closing scenes of their last adventure however, the planet sera has been far from cleansed of underground nasties.
i stand corrected my problem is that, i loved gears 1, hated gears 2.
they've matured beyond schwarzenegger-calibre dialogue and mindless set-pieces and developed some genuinely interesting characters, wrapped in a low key yet personal and compelling plot.
hell, the over the shoulder perspective so favoured by third-person shooters these days owes much to resi 4 too.
in particular, 4-player co-op in the online campaign is what will make the game super fun and give it unlimited replay value.
it's hard to change these games too much without loosing what makes them what they are, but i personally can't realistically rate a game that little bit higher that makes it goty type stuff when it's the basically the third instalment of a very similar game.
maybe i'm wrong, maybe we should just rate games on their own efforts and forget what came before.
one thing i did notice though is when you finish the mode the achievement says 'survived thefirst waves of beast mode' which may suggest there may be more on the way, perhaps as dlc???
to reddit submit article to del.icio.us submit article to digg submit article to stumbleupon close comments 38 by andy robinson for computerandvideogames.com we reckon there's a little bit of epic games that regrets inventing that chainsaw gun.
getting it simply for the story and horde mode.
he also had 30 mins on bf and said, well, i won't say as it may be controversial i'm sure the reviews are all going to be pretty good, and i'm glad to hear about a meaty campaign and i'm very much looking forward to getting it.
i may be wrong, they may have brought a lot more to it, but neither of these games are particularly exceptional in terms of gameplay - very good, solid games but gameplay wise they're not top of the tree for me (although i do love my co-op games).

if you buy the game from gamestop you get a special version of dom called commando dom as a special character if you preorder.
seems a tad harsh to crack down on it merely for preserving the simple unbutchered and slightly refined gameplay fans demanded.
anyway, i might pick this up eventually, i still haven't got round to completing the first one, and i'll be prioritising skyrim and arkham city soon (not to mention the fact i'm busy going through inazuma eleven and the retail version of the monkey island collection).
but still the heavy rain snobs will be put off by that big, blood-soaked gun on the front of the box.
looks like they stepped up a gear.
the way the horde mode uses so much strategy now provides incredibly deep game play.
if i had an xbox i would be picking gears 3 up, no doubt.
picking it up tuesday morning at 9am.
instead it maintains the entertainment factor via a constant stream of variety; in one mission you might be fighting off locust goons on a boat, the next you're down to base weapons in the jungle and fending off a pack of tickers attempting to run off with ammo and pick-ups between their fangs.
as you'll remember from the closing scenes of their last adventure however, the planet sera has been far from cleansed of underground nasties.
it's a stellar compilation of everything the developer's learnt from five years of hugely acclaimed instalments, and polished to perfection thanks to an extra year in construction.
i noticed wal-mart has it so you can get the game for $60 and you get a $20 gift card.
gears of war 2, while unquestionably upping the ante over number one with armies of locust foot soldiers and skyscraper-sized critters, loved a good turret section or aforementioned vehicle atrocity.
in most cases, the third time that a game repeats the same formula it tends not to be met with quite as much enthusiasm, despite how well it might pull off the old tricks, as you say (with some notable exceptions: especially mgs3, which always felt fresh despite keeping the same basic gameplay mechanics).

i couldn't have been anymore bored by it, the maps were poor and everyone just hid in cover with the sawnoff shotty and insta killed you or camped the hell out of the power weapons.
looks like great news for fans.
they've matured beyond schwarzenegger-calibre dialogue and mindless set-pieces and developed some genuinely interesting characters, wrapped in a low key yet personal and compelling plot.
gears of war 3 is the best campaign story epic games has ever made.
wasn't a big fan of the first gears game but the second won me over with hig set pieces and gorgeous looks.
hmmm, on the fence with this at the moment, waaay too many great games coming out soon to get my mits on.
so damn good i've gone straight back to play it again on hardcore mode to try and find more collectibles and cog tags.
but still the heavy rain snobs will be put off by that big, blood-soaked gun on the front of the box.
but more importantly, it's the high-quality game play that makes me want to play the game as soon as possible!
i'm not slagging it off, it looks great.
in fact there's a new enemy faction in town; the glowing, mutated lambent that enjoy nothing more than appearing out of the ground via gigantic enemy-spewing stalks - and they're about to rock the boat (literally in this case).
i'll get this at some point, busy with dead island, deus ex, witcher 2, xenoblade, dragon age 2 and a bunch of other games that have still yet to be completed.
and he says it is f**king epic, which isn't bad considering he didn't play the previous 2 much.
really enjoying this game so far and enjoying the character development i love the gears series for many things, but one thing that i dont love it for is the 'story'.
excellent point, it'd probably be better to say that gow popularised cover-shooter mechanics, as kill.switch certainly outdates it.
i agree beast mode is too easy although the ability to use corpsers, berskerkers and savage boomers is a recent highlight in gaming for me.

i know many will say this is pointless but secretly we love comparisons if we have a preference console gaming and when uncharted 3 is released, its inevitable that declarations of who really owns the king of third person shooters will emerge and i can't wait.
the battles are big, the environments gorgeous and every now and then somebody says "f***" as a nasty looking baddy smashes through the nearside wall.
number 3 looks like fine tuning and polishing that formula even more plus the locus are an ace ememy as it is without the flood like lament, it all makes me want an xbox 360 for those with both consoles, get the bestof both worlds.
still waiting for my dispatched email from game, but they're usually good on getting the games to you early.

going to give beast/horde mode a go tonight me thinks.
my problem is that, i loved gears 1, hated gears 2.
following a refreshingly outlandish introduction sequence (with far less testosterone that you'd expect from a gears opener), the story - penned by acclaimed british sci-fi author karen traviss - picks up two years after the last game's apocalyptic conclusion, with marcus, dom and co held up on an old warship, sailing the ocean and growing crops in a desperate attempt to simply carry on living.
my mate had about 40 mins on horde and beast mode today at the nec (he's a manager at game) and he says it is f**king epic, which isn't bad considering he didn't play the previous 2 much.
the beast mode is the same thing; it gives unlimited replay value.
