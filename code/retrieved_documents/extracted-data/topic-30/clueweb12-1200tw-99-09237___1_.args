originally due for release in 2009 but delayed on multiple occasions, the xbox live arcade game will set you back 800 microsoft points (Â£6.85).there are too many innocents who could be unduly influenced by your heinous propoganda.use your ability to navigate 3d structures from four distinct classic 2d perspectives.explore a serene and beautiful open-ended world full of secrets, puzzles and hidden treasures.unearth the mysteries of the past and discover the truth about reality and perception.its made by just two guys, so its a properindie game, and i would implore everyone to at least try the demo, its the least you could do .loving the platforming genre again at the moment, all thanks to the incredibly underrated rayman returns, which is absolute brilliance...i know next to nothing about the game but it looks too intriguing for me to pass up.sign up to access exclusive gaming content, win prizes and post on our forums.but it did get a bit repetitive, but it's chapters were just the right length to not make it become overly so.i would have stayed, but then you said fez was going to be better than trials...which even though purely subjective, is just plain wrong, and you cannot be allowed to perpetuate such vile untruths in the world.this is going to be the best game released on live this year, yes, even better than trials (but just by a wee bit).if i can refer you to here: viewtopic.phpf=4&t=116955 it should cover everything, glad to see my influence is paying off .alan wake was a fantastic experience, as anyone who has played it will testify too.it is still going to sell bucket loads but still i'd like to have seen it get some hefty promotion.
