games provide many more hours of entertainment, and you can replay it anytime you want.it may even encourage people to turn to piracy or even worse, off gaming all together.that might mean a slight rise in pre-owned prices, but it's better than abolishing them completely and it still means more money for publishers to invest in the production of more games.if pre-owned games were blocked it would certainly spell the end for specialist retail stores as they may have been able to get by before the establishment of the pre-owned market, but that was before the loss of sales through internet sites, as well as downloads, forced them to rely heavily on the sale of pre-owned games for profit.the only way the 720 could do this without totally alienating a large portion of the market would be if retailers took a leaf out of steam's book and had aggressive and frequent sales.if they want me to purchase games at Â£50 retail price then i expect the game to be of exceptional quality with plenty of replay value.i can't afford full price games, hence why the second hand market is good for people like me, who have too much time on my hands at the moment, but lack of money, i would love to be able to walk into a games store & purchase the top 10 games all at full price, and helping the games developers, but in fairness its not the developers who get this money its the publishers like ea, activision, ubisoft, etc etc, who keep a huge percentage of all takings, rather than giving the money to the real talented programmers / graphic designers / music composers who deserve it.this is the reason why it wont happen, ms are not stupid, and even in the small chance that it happens, it will be implimented in a way that ms can remove it with an update, if it starts to affect sales which i dont believe it will (all i will do is be a bit more careful about what i buy) then they will just put out an update and remove it quite simply, this would destroy the xbox brand and any chance it has in the next generation.the way to fix it is to make online passes for every single secondhand game that exists, and if that user wants to play it online (or even have achievements tracked) then you need to buy an online pass for it.if they take away the option of buying pre-owned without significantly adjusting their prices, even less people will be willing to take a chance on buying a brand new game from a publisher or a developer with a low-quality track-record, and the thqs of this world will just be crushed by the likes of ea and activision.whilst i'm unlikely to be negatively impacted by such a system (don't buy used/rarely borrow), if microsoft were to go ahead and do it with the features he's described, it could work out.a much better solution would be to keep the pre-owned market but make retailers give a share of the profits to publishers.it's this kind of attitude that has got thq into so much financial trouble; they have a complete inability to see the bigger picture or to think outside of the box.so he will create a world where i am only going to spend my money on games that i know i will enjoy and take no risks, ultimately removing money from his pocket.this won't only affect people buying used, what about the people who trade them against other purchases, because they don't have the money/space to keep all these games.
