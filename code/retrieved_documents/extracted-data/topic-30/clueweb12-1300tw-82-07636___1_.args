underpowered tech can really hurt a console's chances on the market, unless it's compensated by some other strong unique selling point - like the motion controls of the wii or the additional touch-screen of the ds.they know that making their console powerful, whilst including the tablet, would have been costly and they know that many would not be willing to pay a high price for their console, especially with the world economy as it is now.the wii may have outsold the ps3 and 360 individually, but combined they represent a bigger market which is more secure.it potentially effects the viability of third party games on it, at least after the new ps/xbox consoles, which effects the user if they don't want to buy two consoles (i don't).the dreamcast had a high-quality software library (arguably better than ps2 in the early days), but the console sold dismally, as everybody skipped it and waited instead for the ps2, which was known to be more powerful and have wider third-party support.my kids are 3 and 4 and they love playing on the ipad, it's easy, intuitive and fun.i always wondered how they would manage the power and the screen while keeping it affordable and a decent profit margin.nintendo knows this, and they know from their experience in this industry, that having a powerful console has never been a factor in terms of sales.it has always been the least powerful console which sold the most and the reason for that was due to the quantity of quality games.the downside is that they're starting from a new userbase against 60 million odd ps3 and xbox's alike, so the money for a publisher will still be earned through ps3 and xbox.the wii u can appeal to this market of family gaming, education etc.consumers all over the world have by now finally upgraded to hdtvs, so cutting down on power and making a console that will still struggle with demanding 1080p content doesn't sound like a good idea at this stage.third party games are still games and are a big part of the line up and appeal of a console.but if they do release a console at the same power or just ahead of what we currently have then surely this could be bad for sales.the 400 pound cost to the casual gamer will be offset by the fact that they're paying 40 quid a pop for new games, when they've gotten so used to paying 99p for them on the app store or even getting them for free.
