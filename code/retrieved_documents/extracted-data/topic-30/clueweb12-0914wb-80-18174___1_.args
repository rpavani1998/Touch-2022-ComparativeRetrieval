the kotor games were excellent, and if obsidian were able to transfer that kind of quality onto the online world then it would be a major coup.they have more than enough talent and money to work on all those.even if this mmorpg isn't "instead of" kotor 3, it will still use up time and resources that could have gone into developing at least one single player game instead.it's a much safer option, mmo's always turn out to be disasters.i loathe mmorpgs with a passion, and the thought of one of my favourite developers wasting their skills, time, and money on some pos on-line game when they could be making a proper rpg (i.e. kotor 3, *single player only*) instead is a highly unpleasant one.its true that most of the current mmorpgs tend to be quite shallow in game content, reyling instead on player interaction to satisfy gamers needs.mmorpgs are the domain of developers who are too lazy/talentless to come up with good storyline ideas and write decent dialogue.if they discover the new game ways, then, they will love the online and they never will play conventional games in the future.this is coming from someone who has played mmos, the community is generally horrible, the gameplay is almost as bad, and they don't have a thing on single player rpgs.hopefully this is true kotor is one of the best games on the xbox if not the best and this would be a great games on the xbox360 and hopefully soon to follow on the pc the timeframe is perfect they dont hav a specific guidline it gives the devs lots of freedom look what they did with the first kotor classic this one will definetly b a great game my only worry is storage and space for the devs to work with i jus hope they have a base thats full of content then post the things they couldnt include on the game for online play on xbox live content so we can get a good feel of the game this is great news lets just hope that this news will be announced by bioware oh god!ok yeah, they could use the time it would take for to make this for something else but, there are gonna be the millions of people who play online games (like me) that wants to play kotor online, quite frankly it actually takes longer to make a single player rpg than it does to make an mmo, so time wise doesn't really matter as much, just think of it this way, its another kotor game that just happens to be online, and if its better than swg and wow then i imagine it could be the best online game that could ever of been made, just because you don't want to pay money to play a game after you've already bought it doesn't mean it isn't good, or because you might not have a fast enough broadband to play it, it is just after all another game and swg is getting on now and there needs to be another sw mmo thats gonna take over swg, and sw kotor online is definitely the way to go.well, thats what i don't understand, if they are making kotor online, it won't take over the kotor sp games, its separate, it won't have anything to do with kotor 1, 2 or 3 (when it gets made), it will be a separate story with hardly any relation to the sp games, so it won't matter if they make it because, it won't take over the original kotor games we all know and love, so thats why i don't see why people won't give it a chance, the point is if you don't want to play it, then don't, it's a as simple as that, it's just star wars in the old republic, in my opinion, they should make more games in the kotor era and not just leave it to a sp rpg trilogy (i hope for a trilogy), anyway thats my daily rant over, lol.i refuse to pay for a game, pay for live and then pay a monthly fee to play it.although i love kotor, i would much rather have a brand new single player rpg that has absolutely nothing to do with star wars than a kotor mmorpg.more importantly, the license for baldur's gate as a franchise is still owned by interplay - the same interplay thatstill owe bioware money for unpaid royalties for baldur's gate ii - and the forgotten realms license is with atari.
