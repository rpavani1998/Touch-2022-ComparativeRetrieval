it certainly ran a lot better than both fallout 3 and new vegas even after they where patched.
"bethesda game studios has been hard at work on creating the first set of game add-ons that will beexclusive to the xbox 360 video game and entertainment system from microsoft," it said.
even something like knights of the nine would be pretty decent, i just don't want them to take the route they did with most of the fallout 3 dlc again - with one or two exceptions most of it was poor.
the fallout 3 dlc deal seemed more agonising for my ps3-only brethren, seeing as it was much longer.
supposedly it's helped it but not fixed it.

i dunno, i think a spaceship crashing into skyrim would be pretty epic.
