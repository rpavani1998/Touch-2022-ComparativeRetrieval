it looks futuristic, possibly science fiction-esque.it doesn't actually state that it was an xbox game, and seeing as appears the background is the blueprints for a hotel i would say it is ubisoft redoing the original rainbow 6 or activision rebooting s.w.a.t.if microsoft is referring to a "remake" of an original xbox game, i think it could be anything from mechwarrior, to star wars: kotor, to halo: combat evolved.unfortunately, it looks like readers will have to wait until oxm issue 72, which will hit stores in april, to find out what it is - as the game's publisher has pushed back its announcement.rare are too busy making more crappy kinect party games and tweaking the avatars to make them even less likable.best guess so far, but i don't think sim city would work too well on a console now.sign up to access exclusive gaming content, win prizes and post on our forums.if it's a halo remake, then great, but it wouldn't be that exciting.its chronicles of riddick: escape from butcher bay i doubt they'd make such a fuss over the halo remake as it seems to be pretty common knowledge that it is going to happen at some point.highly unlikely, but would amuse me q*bert hd revolution, 64 players online and a dubstep soundtrack.aaa exclusives are something microsoft has access to that we actually didn't even see on the original xbox."the publisher was very apologetic but apparently the game just won't be ready in time.sadly many great games have had office buildings.heres hoping ~ reborn implys its not a hd update but full blown remake with multiplayer ect the best bit about original halo was the story and the settings and finale so all is good if gameplay is changed for me it looks like the very first level in halo: ce remember, in the ship where you first fight the brutes and then go down to the elevators.. it looks like the very first level in halo: ce remember, in the ship where you first fight the brutes and then go down to the elevators..which doesn't really narrow it down too much in the world of video games.
