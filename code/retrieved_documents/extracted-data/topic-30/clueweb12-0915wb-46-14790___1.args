the ps3 did no upscalling whatsoever and you go ahead and put your ps2 copy in and look at how s**t it looks with the ps3 @trying@ to upscale this.
oh yeah, that'd involve spending a bit, rather than making users pay twice.
but that'd require more work which ain't going to happen.
guns of the patriots was just plain awful,it tried so hard to be a metal gear game it forgot to offer any actual game (such was my horror at guns,as soon as i had completed it i felt i had to play my psx copy of mgs from start to finish)
and in some cases, its actually cheaper buying the hd remakes than the ps2 copies.
"what are you playin' around with that ketchup for?" would be fantastic if it included mgs 2 substance and mgs 3 subsistance,but they will probably follow as some sort of dlc.
i've also got twin snakes on the cube.
hd classics are pointless if people say if you want ps2 bc then get a ps2 so why dont these same hypocrites buy these hd classics which arent really hd they are just upscaled like what the 60gb
hopefully they can get something in place to secure twin snakes rather than the original as it was more or less the same graphics as 2+3
i bought mgs 1,2 and 3 from ebay for pennies but cant be arsed to set up the ps2 again.
not that i am a fan of mgs, but this will sell like all hell, probably mostly to people that have gone through them countless times before.
played that kinda recently and it still stands up as a great game today.

as for this point, i am going to assume you do not own a ps3 and assume you haven't seen gow collection running either.
end of argument tbh i wonder if psycho mantis will be able to read the hdd this time, i seem to remember he couldn't in mgs4.
the gow collection is gorgeous,especially god of war ii,it's noticeably different in terms of overall polish/sheen and enhanced audio.
in the mag's new issue, in stores now, it reports that snake is "in the facelift queue", and that the "first three" mgs games are set to be reborn in high definition.

they changed the accents of the women, they just made them all american...which is hardly game breaking.
i must admit that i would buy it and put it to the bottom of my to play list.
snake eater was back to brilliant with amazing set-pieces and presence......

if they re-did everything, cutscenes, textures, lighting, shaders etc and released it in a retail boxed version then i would definitely be inclined to pick up a copy.
also if you truly hate something you have to like it in some twisted kind of way, i would rather not care for something than hate it.
ofcourse, if you have the ps2 copies you probably have a ps2 as well so just use that.
*waves cane* hd classics are pointless if people say if you want ps2 bc then get a ps2 so why dont these same hypocrites buy these hd classics which arent really hd they are just upscaled like what the 60gb
the 60gb upscales the ps2 games but it is not hd.
i was about to make a comment about how microsoft release some of their old games and also have short games with multiplayer tacked on.
i could do that simply by putting the original ps2 game in my ps3.
edit : well sony said people don't buy ps3 to play ps2 games and hd remakes are basically ps2 games.
and i have the original mgs on the ps3 and it just won't hold up without some sort of overhaul.
i own the first four mgs games, but would be very interested in a hd remake of the first three, providing it is proper hd and not what they did with god of war 1+2 and simply re-released the old games and allowed the ps3 to upscale those old textures.
they are classic games, bargain price and in their hay day they were great.
idc if it's Â£40, i'll definitely be buying it.
i remembered being utterly wowed by how pretty the fury's balls of fire were in his boss section...
i'm not even interested in most hd remakes, but this is mgs.

i would probably get this since i have never played mgs we shall see.
my point is that it is enjoyable to play these 'old' games and if they look prettier with a few layers of make up then im all for it.
would be awesome to play through the first three titles again.
i am currently enjoying replaying classic games with him.
if they actually had ps3 graphics that would be another story go away.
i just wish a little more work would go into some of these hd releases that aren't just making them sharper and pointing out old gen textures.
*folds arms patiently and waits for the jak and daxter trilogy's turn to get the hd treatment* hd classics are pointless if people say if you want ps2 bc then get a ps2 so why dont these same hypocrites buy these hd classics which arent really hd they are just upscaled like what the 60gb
in the mag's new issue, in stores now, it reports that snake is "in the facelift queue", and that the "first three" mgs games are set to be reborn in high definition.
but it looks quite bad now and there are no trophies, so i would love this!
if they actually had ps3 graphics that would be another story hi, i've noticed your non biased views on all things playstation
if you did then you would know they did a fantastic job of remastering them into hd, that much so that the graphics were on par with some current gen games.
i also have a ps2 but again mgs2 & 3 don't have trophies and are not hd!
exactly but people just enjoy being c**ts.
there's always a mention of 'cut-scenes' with talk of any mgs game but people should absolutely not forget the classic gameplay packed into mgs3, which is the most action-packed of the solid series.
well the graphics on the hd version of gow2 rivals a lot of current gen games and it looks fantastic!
because backwards compatability adds hardware costs for everyone.
but snake eater running in hd with no frame rate problems would be a dream come true, i almost got a semi just seeing this headline.
^_^ metal gear solid 3 would be the highlight of this collection for me though,easily the best in the solid series.
these hd classics which arent really hd they are just upscaled like what the 60gb ps3 does.

and further more the hd facelifts are more than just a simple upscale.
because nintendo had a hand in developing it.
wish they would do a killzone 1 remix surprised xbox dont do the same for their followers.
wasn't really a fan of the second game, and i'm not sure how the first one will benefit from being made hd with ps1 graphics.
i also remember that he couldn't move the pad either due to the joke that is/was sixaxis!
he got a wii from 'santa' and whilst he has enjoyed playing pikachu's adventure he is more interested in vc games!!
although with all the hd remakes it does sort hurt that sony took away the bc option.
making improved hd remakes of classics means those fans who want to play ps2 games can get an improved version of them at a reasonable price and those who dont want to play ps2 games dont need to pay more for a feature their not going to use.
not to mention they probably helped finance the project.
but i doubt they ever will do though seeing as the ps3 isn't very good for emulating ps2 games, but then neither is alot of pc's.
they made it more "hollywood" by having everyone doing back flips like they were from the matrix, not really a flaw though.
i for 1 would love hd updates at such a high level like gow.
my original ps2 burnt out between playing that and san andreas so i never really got the chance to go through it a few times as i had to borrow a mates ps2 to finish snake eater.
it would be a great game for the collection!
playing ps2 games look horrible on hd tvs.
however, any reworking of kojima-san's much-loved original trio will be music to the ears of playstation nuts, with the games still very much considered classics of the genre.
i don't see why they shouldn't be allowed to use twin snakes.
metal gear solid would need alot of work doing to get it looking good nowadays even with a hd coat of paint, and i wouldn't think they'd be allowed to use twin snakes as the base.
i can't wait to see otacon's p**s in hd these games have been in the back of my mind for ages with buying a ps2 to get them but this is brilliant news, i have mgs1 and 4 on ps3 already
but i have my eyes firmly set on snake eater for 3ds.
which i get, seeing as i'll be doing the same with team ico's games and whatever is rehashed on the 3ds.

only problem is i won't be able to use my action replay to unlock all the weapons and equipment.
we have been playing super mario 1 and 3 (2 not so much...lol) since he was 4.
