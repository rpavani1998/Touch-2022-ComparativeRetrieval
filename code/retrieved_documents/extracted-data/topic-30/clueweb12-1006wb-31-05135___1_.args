i agree the wii does have the best interface (i actually can't stand the flow of the xmb, and not having a proper 'mini xmb' in game, plus it's not viewable against certain themes, and ms are putting more and more focus on non gaming content) because, no matter what people think of it, it's the only pure games console out there.we haven't tried any of this, so we can't guarantee that it works or that it doesn't mess with your online gaming/other network services.i have a pc to do multiple things - emulators, play music/video files, operating systems, my consoles are ultimately for playing my games on.don't get me wrong sony have broken more consumer rights laws than you can shake a stick at.the first method involves blocking the domain through your router, which will throw up a 404 if you try and access it from a pc.here's how to do it (using this method will require you to re-download title updates): we haven't tried any of this, so we can't guarantee that it works or that it doesn't mess with your online gaming/other network services.this is yet another reason not to cave in to ms blatant extortion scheme, and since online gaming on my xbox 360 means nothing to me, i really don't perceive myself to be at a loss.360 users seem quite fond of the new-look dashboard, but one major gripe on the forums points to the prominence given to adverts, and in particular how they take priority over the games and content.i pay for cvg via my subscription of gamesmaster & edge magazines, even though 90% of their content is published here on cvg as 'news' a month lateras aposed to ms that has added features with each revision, has extended its warrenty pretty much indefinately to faults with the hardware they owned up to and has given the homebrew community the tools to be able to create and sell games on the 360s marketplace.until it actually starts to get in the way of me finding and getting what i want, there are far bigger issues in this industry to get p**sed at - drm, the quality of games out of the box, pricing, not enough games using dedicated servers, on disc dlc, the value of dlc and god, the way one time codes are used in games like arkham or ea's annual releases likes fifa, nfs etc.every single tab is plastered with adverts (most of which have nothing to do with gaming), and yet the essential things the console uses (like er, i don't know, games tabs) are buried and very difficult to see, and are also a quarter of the size of the adverts.alternatively you can use opendns, a free service which can block specific sites.when this generation of consoles started i was all for ms new console, having owned an original xbox beforehand and loved every minute of it, but its clear their priority's have changed, shoving s*** kinnect down your throat and a million, streaming, bandwidth sucking adverts in your face.this really annoyed me in the last couple of xmb's and has been getting steadily worse and is a major reason why i took the decision not to renew my gold account when it runs out very soon.
