if ihad a choice, i would have had kotor remade, but alas, we don't always get what we want.
part of me is hoping jet set radio though.
highly unlikely, but would amuse me q*bert hd revolution, 64 players online and a dubstep soundtrack.

meanwhile, oxm issue 71 will hit stores on march 10.
aaa exclusives are something microsoft has access to that we actually didn't even see on the original xbox.
blueprints would make more sense.
oh i would lurrrve that once we get done moving i am going to break that out again going to go ebil this time though (and steel battalion)
still love my mw3 for pc on of the last great games i ever bought before consoles became huge.
"the publisher was very apologetic but apparently the game just won't be ready in time.
it looks futuristic, possibly science fiction-esque.
experience the thrill of the hum drum life of a computer technician with microsoft office sim 3000.
the background is an architectural plan for a building entrance like a corporate headquarters with security swipe card stations to get in - sounds like syndicate to me i want crimson skies
"it's a real nuisance, not least since we've been trying to cover this game for months, but these things happen," oxm editor jon hicks told cvg.
"the publisher was very apologetic but apparently the game just won't be ready in time.
the blue print looks like an office plan to me.
it doesn't even say its an xbox game.
just because yeah i didn't notice that they were desk and not tables
10 would make sense for a halo 1 remake(10 years).
that even contains drawings like seen on that graphic.
it's a circuit board, very similar to the one on the original box art.
but remember, microsoft could also be talking about something like a game that has been rumored for quite some time based on one of the most popular arcade games ever: killer instinct!!!
i had thought deus ex due to human revolution but that's not exactly new news.
if all it ends up being is a halo remake or hd release of halo then... this will have to be one of the most boring reveals ever.
rare are too busy making more crappy kinect party games and tweaking the avatars to make them even less likable.
update: publisher pushes back announcement in oxm uk share this tweet + submit article to n4g submit article to reddit submit article to del.icio.us submit article to digg submit article to stumbleupon close comments 72 by cvg staff for computerandvideogames.com a secret triple-a title set to be 'reborn' on xbox 360 has been cheekily teased in the latest issue of oxm uk.
however, there's bad news for 360 owners wishing for the full reveal of the blockbuster game any time soon - as it's been pushed back by a month.
looks like an office... don't remember seeing desks and bathrooms in halo halo, its gotta be.
heres hoping ~ reborn implys its not a hd update but full blown remake with multiplayer ect the best bit about original halo was the story and the settings and finale so all is good if gameplay is changed for me it looks like the very first level in halo: ce remember, in the ship where you first fight the brutes and then go down to the elevators.. it looks like the very first level in halo: ce remember, in the ship where you first fight the brutes and then go down to the elevators..
unfortunately, it looks like readers will have to wait until oxm issue 72, which will hit stores in april, to find out what it is - as the game's publisher has pushed back its announcement.
it definitely looks like it could be from that game.
i know its gonna be halo ce but would love shenmue 1 & 2 on a double disc or down load halo.

elite, on the other hand, would be very exciting indeed!
then again i could be right and it is actually how to be a complete bastard.
it doesn't say one of the greatest xbox games.
then again, magazines hype up these things to more than they deserve.
someone above my post guessed correctly, that what cvg have said on facebook a couple of minutes ago: that secret xbox 360 reboot....
however, there's bad news for 360 owners wishing for the full reveal of the blockbuster game any time soon - as it's been pushed back by a month.
so i agree with it being an office and not a hotel as i thought.
c'mon wtf are rare doing with their time, it's gotta be from them.
i don't get how people are missing what that image is.
yeah i didn't notice that they were desk and not tables
as for the background, i thought it was a circuit board at first, but zooming in i guess it could be a large room/office.
it doesn't fit the sensational headline, the remake of halo coming in hd is old news now.
that could be anything from the new x -com to theme bloody hospital.
i would p**s my self side ways if it was ff7 and an xbox 360 exclusive.
heres a video with the map in it shown at 2:31 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nz17eic4mya what about conker's bad fur day, classic game.
also i heard ea are working on a remake of it my money would be on that.
it doesn't actually state that it was an xbox game, and seeing as appears the background is the blueprints for a hotel i would say it is ubisoft redoing the original rainbow 6 or activision rebooting s.w.a.t.
any of these and i'd be a happy chappy.
which doesn't really narrow it down too much in the world of video games.
it could be elite as someone else has mentioned.
although it looks more like an office with desks than a hotel.
best guess so far, but i don't think sim city would work too well on a console now.
"it's a real nuisance, not least since we've been trying to cover this game for months, but these things happen," oxm editor jon hicks told cvg.
its chronicles of riddick: escape from butcher bay i doubt they'd make such a fuss over the halo remake as it seems to be pretty common knowledge that it is going to happen at some point.
rainbow 6 s.w.a.t counterstrike syndicate it's a blueprint for an office building judging by the workstations.
it looks futuristic, possibly science fiction-esque.
i'm sure there was a story a couple of months ago about a trademark or something for syndicate being in discussion with the original publishers or such like.
kotor please gta san andreas or knights of the old republic it will either be jet set radio or halo.
i reckon it is more likely to be s.w.a.t than r6 though seeing that acti don't have any squad based shooters barring the zombie mode in cod.
sadly many great games have had office buildings.
if it's a halo remake, then great, but it wouldn't be that exciting.
if microsoft is referring to a "remake" of an original xbox game, i think it could be anything from mechwarrior, to star wars: kotor, to halo: combat evolved.
aaa exclusives were something the original xbox had a lot of.
i don't think this is halo - far too predictable.
