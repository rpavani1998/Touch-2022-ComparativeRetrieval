second, in response to the article, sony should be doing the opposite.
but to be honest in the past 5 years i've had no problems, however i have a good internet provider.

if they want people to join up to the subscription service, then it needs to appeal to more people, not to mention needs more exposure as well, not to mention maybe also look at direct redeemable vouchers you can buy in store like a membership renewal for many other online services.
sony are having huge financial problems and need to stop firing money (they are not earning from psn) at the ps network to keep it running.
no because you'll probably catch something.
wowzers! - humanhead  colour me excited by this trailer! - kk-headcharge78 must keep an eye on this  game! - gmcb007 cool trailer!
the actual psn used for online gaming is no different than using xbl.
off topic forum store sony isn’t done with its pre-e3 surprises: a  “huge new ps3 exclusive” is set to be unveiled this thursday - http://t.co/pnrj8s7r #ps3 retweet this click  awesome trailer - looking forward to seeing more of this! - aawells07
rather than take things away from the free service, they should improve/make ps+ really worthwhile.
the content of live may be better(this is subjective, i dont like most the 360 exclusives on main system, but others may prefer these games to the exclusives on ps3, same with live and psn) , but again, that's not the service itself you're paying for, that's content.
i can download demo's that are 2 gb in size on a 10mb connection with low ping in under 40 mins.
not saying live is s**t but does paying for sex make it any better?
new ceo kaz hirai's strategy outline indicates "the company also aims to increase sales by enriching its catalogue of downloadable game titles and subscription services available through the psn platform."
they should just enhance psplus, make it sexier.
sign up to access exclusive gaming content, win prizes and post on our forums.
people are entitled to opinions, but acting with intention of clearly trying to provoke a fanboy debate, is acting like a cock imo.
you're paying, because ms wants you to, simple.
that would make an enjoyable read, and show these people for what they really are.
just to point out, no one can say ms has suffered from charging for live, and to be honest its such a small fee for a year, how could anyone complain?
sony should also move quickly to shift paid content other than gaming to the network."
the hundreds of millions they make from game sales (which they've no problem bragging about) should be covering server costs.
billy pidgeon of m2 research.. pwaahaaaahaaaahaaaaaa!!!
pc is only free online gaming system in fullest sense in the scenario where they charge for online mo, but again its currently being proposed that mp will be charged for, or movie services, let alone officially confirmed.
whether it is the superior content of xbla (as well as the far cheaper pricepoints ), speed of download or the infinitely better chatting service it is well worth the purchase.
if psn was as good as live i'd have kept me ps3.
more downloadable games from the playstation back catalogue along with new release and an increase in the number of subscription services on offer seems like it would move psn and the playstation console forward rather than just copying ms and making a system wide online pass like live.
sony have repeatedly stressed how they see psplus more in terms of adding content that will offer value, rather than charging for what they consider to be basic content ie demos and mp.
i'm subbed to ps+ on my main account, as long as multiplayer gaming remains free i don't care what they change, but free multiplayer for every game on any sen account is a must.
if you read my comment, or just understood the differences , you would know that the update differences are different on both machines, because of the way the os works, on 360 the updates for games and for the os are tiny as they are incremental, whereas they arent on ps3.
however i wouldn't feel sorry for 360 users as the difference in quality between live and psn is huge.
xbox live is a clusterf**k when it comes to it's subscriptions.
ive got both and like many here i have to say live is well worth the additional cost (25 quidish, anyone who pays 40 is a terrible shopper).
you get the downtime of psn for maintenance as well as down side, but not issue if you just log in in morning.
you wouldn't be asked to pay more to see part of a movie in the cinema.
in case it has escaped everyone who plays online games, streams movies and other things from ps network, it costs a lot of money to keep that running, and you can tell the ps network is not a paid for service as it shows in comparison to xbox live, say what you will about ms, but live is leagues ahead of the ps network, i should know i have both and wish sony would give ps network a serious face lift.
the x game chat and updates are not psn issues, but issues with the os, and cant be resolved by any changes to service.
i wont be renewing either of them next year tho the only thing i find with psn over live is the speed i have just upgraded to infinity and my pc hits 38mbs the ps3 is wired and only gets 16mbs and the xbox seems alot quicker at downloading games than the ps3 so wont make a difference when i get uped to 80mps latter this year with only the pc using it i only purchased ps+ for the free games for the kids nowt else
it's way over priced for what you get and even the standard of what you get is miles below xbox live.
it also confirmed this morning that psn will be going offline for "scheduled maintenance" today - and that you won't be able to access ps3 online play for at least 13 hours.
utter b*****ks, ive had 360 and ps3, and really isnt any better on live than psn.
i feel sorry for you, as you're clearly a bell end fan boy who has nothing better to do than provoke people.
i agree, if you want home you should pay for it!
i'm struggling to think of anything they could remove that people would be willing to pay for (other than online gaming).
haha he called the meanie a 'bell end.'
it is free to play online, and it will remain so if you read the article.
streaming videos on netflix was instant and no need to buffer etc etc.
i thought school holidays had finished.
they havent lost money , they just havent maximised earning from it in same way ms have, and like it or not, they have to adapt.
i think both have some really good offerings and like most things between the two one seems to balance out the other.
one thing i do agree with is, it is a matter of taste in the end, non of the things i mentioned about the ps3 would be a deal breaker if i had to choose between the 2.
spiderless love  the style of this - jensonjet cvg home /
there is a justification in that servers cost money to stay online.
shank 2, trine 2 and sly racoon were all great titles to give away and considering ive only had it 6-7 weeks im getting my moneys worth quite quickly.
you must be s**t in bed then if you were having a conversation with her.. nah, that her idea of dirty talking
it's host balancing code was horrendous, and anyone who was host was penalised horribly.
and i disagree with you about with the speed of downloads, i have both the ps3 and 360 and i can assure you, its much much quicker to download from live, especially when it comes to a system update, ps3 system updates are a complete joke, take forever.
all dependent on number of people using service and your network at time id imagine rather than live or psn always had issues downloading with ps3 game updates taking hrs to download as well as the os updates taking far too long dont really know similar size games running at the same time the xbox always seems to be first even if it is on wifi
psn+ is pretty poor, i had it for around 18months and content was average at best.
i dont know net work is fine comming in a 20ms ping and 0 errors according to speedtest.net @kbekl if you've got ps+, you can set your ps3 to turn on at a particular time and download updates, just set it up to search for updates at 4am-6am.
now if this means they start charging a subscription for the services thats fine, as long as they improve the service and the content available, no one looses out.
360 has more refined operating system ?
thought you'd be 11 or 12,and mummy and daddy buy all your games and xbl for you.
oh wait, no you cant.
i think people get mixed up with party chat and the message system, which both are down to the os not the servers.
there's no arguing that at all.
obvious they'd phase it like this from the moment plus was revealed.
taste comes into this a lot but if people use the negligable price as a deciding factor then more fool you, it's like opting for a 3 mobile as opposed to a vodafone, i've used both extensively and live is simply better.
he's been trying on several threads today
well that what his mother said to me as i was boning her brain out.
analysts get paid to talk, they have to say something even if it's not true or retarded haha he called the meanie a 'bell end.'
if your feeling flush then its a good thing to have just for the free mothly game, its better than nothing and the recent shift 2 was a great deal as its a good racing game.
twice today you've tried to start a flame off over nothing.
as long as online play is still free i'm not really bothered, i doubt anything will change anyway, if analysts were to be believed we'd all have been paying to play online since two minutes after the psn launched.
i'm intrigued by this! -
i could not agree more.
http://i43.tinypic.com/9jpp2o.jpg i hope this convinces more gamers to just game on pc and leave all this money grabbing b*****ks behind.
wedbush securities analyst michael pachter told gamesindustry.biz: "i think it's unlikely that they will require a fee, but think they will strip down the free version to multiplayer and not much else in order to encourage people to pay the fee."
i feel sorry for those broke ass ps3 fanboys who say ps3 is better than xbox because its free to play online!!
sony made the psn free this gen as an incentive to buy the machine over the xbox, they gave up on the chance of bringing in millions to try and gain more market share.
i wont be renewing either of them next year tho the only thing i find with psn over live is the speed i have just upgraded to infinity and my pc hits 38mbs the ps3 is wired and only gets 16mbs and the xbox seems alot quicker at downloading games than the ps3 so wont make a difference when i get uped to 80mps latter this year with only the pc using it
i can't believe you're a 42 year old buster!!
but then i subscribe to psn+ and reckon it is worth every penny.
makes no sense but business sense.
michael pachter is full of hot air and every time he talk it is full of crap.
it's true, there's little value in just removing free demos.
however in recent years i would say that sony have definately upped there game as far as psn is concerned.

you need to cool ya brief http://cloud.lgly.in/images/stories/generic/people/ali-g.jpg cos the staines massive will merk ya sucka, innit.
but i fail to see the logic is charging for demos.
all in the last 30 days.
microsoft will also implement a new strategy to 'further monetize' xbox live subscribers this year,according to the linkedin profile of a group product planner at the company.
if you siad, you think 360
i game mostly on my 360 and pay for it(even if i have the choice to play on ps3) and is just the better service for "me".
this is nothing to do with psn or live, it's simply a relatively unrefined os in comparison to 360.
unless you purchase your games pre-owned and then you have to buy an online pass.
you must be s**t in bed then if you were having a conversation with her..
i would be willing to bet a testicle that sony will start charging next gen at the very least, sony already realise they dropped the ball this gen by not charging for psn.
your alternatives wouldnt be any better.
i will never, ever pay for psn in it present state.
as for what sony are wanting to charge for, they need to be really careful.
anyone who says otherwise is an idiot or a liar.
but it appears the online pass is 'supposed' to be doing that.
ms's business is os's , and they produced a much more refined one this generation for their console.
people buy the ps3 console for the free network services and if they do a pay a fee for the full multiplayer experience then they will start loseing more customers i feel sorry for those broke ass ps3 fanboys who say ps3 is better than xbox because its free to play online!!
every game you talked about there i have for the 360 and i can assure it has very very rarely been a lagfest.
pachter:sony can get more revenue from advertising, item transactions and specialized services to enhance specific aspects of online gameplay such as custom content and rules for use for individuals, guilds and other groups.
ive stopped looking at their deals each month.
no, i called the bell end a bell end.
can't see how not allowing people to download demo's is going to make them or the developers money?
saying that im really impressed with psn+ and its freebies.
the idea of servers being somehow better etc is utter bs.
well you could always buy a 360 and get free online gaming.........
i only purchased ps+ for the free games for the kids nowt else i pay for live for the kids to watch sky as it is cheaper than paying sky for the additional box in the house altho now i pay for ps+ and live for no reason as the kids wanted pc's instead although did get shift 2 for the ps3 today for free as well as shank 2 (havnt had that sort of thing from ms tho)
or are they completely out of ideas?
boom, no more waiting around for 1gb updates to download.
if i pay £40+ for a new game then i expect to be able to play it online without having to pay anything extra.
there's no way that they will change that this gen as it goes against what they have set in place with free online gaming.
it was also notorious for lag and netcode being rubbish until about 6 months after release.
im already a ps plus subscriber.
we get proper shafted compared to the yanks though...
and i know its nothing to do with my connection, i have 100mb broadband.
your just a lobster face!!snm.you need to cool ya brief your just a lobster face!!snm.you need to cool ya brief it's "you're" not "your" mandem.
i doubt that would encourage many to pay for a better service.
people buy the ps3 console for the free network services and if they do a pay a fee for the full multiplayer experience then they will start loseing more customers you know, i just read your comment and let out a sigh, no harm to you, but im sick to the teeth of all this s**te about sony loosing customers if they start charging for ps network, im sorry, but i believe your totally wrong.
they lost money because they were unable to understand the latest digital trends so that's not my problem.
i think trophyies and in game stat tracking should be for psn+ subscribers only... ...carm down it's only an opinion.
a demo is supposed to be there to encourage you to buy the game so charging for it defeats the object.
sony's so saida explains psn's new name and itunes ambitions...£57 for a ps3 game: why psn's pricing structure is broken opinion: sony has to fix the bizarre prices - before it's too late, argues psm3... got a hot tip or a piece of news you think we should cover?
fifa 12 was equally s**t online on ps3 and 360, crysis 2 lagged as much on ps3 as much as 360, cod blops was a lag fest on 360 as much as ps3 etc etc. demos were downloaded as quick etc etc the only major improvement of live is x game chat, and that's a restriction of ps3's os eating up too much ram.
for me i really can't tell the difference between playing online via xbl or psn, really isn't any difference.
i've had mw3 and bf3 on both machines and both run exactly same, same lag and same chavvy idiots on cod on both systems.
ms's os is more efficient and better designed, and that's where any improvements of live over psn are found.
they can see the money that ms is making from live.
journey is a real gem on psn and although 10 quid is a lot for it i feel its well worth it (you know it would be 1200 msp tho, roughly 8 quid).
in fact cvg should do an article about these analysts, what they predicted to happen against what actually happened.
you really do get what you pay for with live.
2 comments really, first, just because you pay for a service doesn't automatically make it better, the price needs to be justified.
they can charge for anything else that's additional or not paid for any where else.
sony will want a slice of that pie this time.
in general its just a much more robust and stable service.
- bladedfalcon one of my favourite trailers ever  - winner2 watch the debut trailer now!
he should be called guy-who-points-out-the-bleeding-obvious!
i pay 40 quid for a game, i have to add 40 to unlock what's already on the disk and on top of that i will have to pay a fee for whatever purpose, no thank you.
anyway, they have repeatedly stressed they won't charge for online play, but maybe they will shift certain content like demos to ps plus and add further content.
sony should also move quickly to shift paid content other than gaming to the network.
the only other thing i preferred was not to do with live at all, but simply way updates on hardware and software are installed on 360.
in all honesty i just think when folk say they see a better service on 360 they're just trying to convince themselves that what they paying for isn't simply ms ripping them off to line the shareholders pockets, well unfortunatly, it is, and you are.
if sony think i'll pay a sub to access my lovefilm account then they'll lose a customer here.
this is also why they have to be installed afterwards.
i am of the opinion that forced payment to access online features is corporate greed personified.
all 3 of those games i mentioned were lag fests and you may have got lucky, fifa 12 consistently drops out and has server errors(this is more likely ea servers than live, and is equally bad on ps3, because ea has own servers), crysis 2 is notorious as a lag fest and hence game community died within weeks, and again is not related to live, as it's ea game, with own servers and it's netcode that's issue, whilst cod blops worked fine for me on 360 until an update around new years and then lagged like bitch.
when i had my 360 they took equally as long, so i dont buy the live is a better service bs.
sony said last month that there are over 90 million psn accounts worldwide.
360 offers better content online?
anyway having had experience with plus and having a constant xbox live subscription i have to say i am more than happy to pay a fairly cheap price for the quality of service you get.
the  tagline 'revenge solves everything' is genius! - appyday
sony really needs to up it's game when it comes to the next console because psn is quite frankly terrible, when it isn't down for maintenance, it seems to take an age to download demos, dlc or even just updates, some times it takes 15-20 mins to download an update that may take 2 or 3 on xbox, then of course you have to install it, why it's just sloppy, i remember the ps3 advertising around launch hinting that the ps3 was going to be the one stop shop entertainment wise, hasn't exactly worked out for them has it?
the myth of live being much better and proof of you get what you pay for, is just that, a myth.
and have never had issues downloading games on psn.
there's no justification for online subscriptions, and if sony do it then more fool them.
psn + is a joke, pay for access to some betas, cheap games i would never buy etc...
dropped on your head a lot as a child?
i had no regrets not renewing live membership and selling 360 recently.
my live gold account ran out last week and i could still access love film but you have to have a gold account to download the app to begin with.
billy pidgeon of m2 research agreed.
with ice-cream on the side!
why is guy called an analyst?
convice yourself all you want but lag is simply down to your connection speed and time of day you play.
shift 2 - free trine 2 - free sly cooper hd - free shank 2 - free
most my mates have both machines and no one notices any difference between the two services.
why should you have to pay more on top of the game's price?
i feel like paying for plus is enough.
regardless of your download speed, there's more issues involved in using net.
i still think one of the best things live or psn could offer as part of their subscription package is the ability to run your own server with your own settings for any game.
what you getting knickers in twist about, this hasnt even happened yet, and if they stick to previous stance of simply adding content to psplus instead to try entice people, they may not strip down psn at all, but if they do, they would simply be getting further inline with ms as their competitor, so what would your loss be?
also, if i'm already paying for a subscription service like netflix or lovefilm then making me pay another subscription to access that subscription is a rip off.
i think sony would best benefit by continuing to build out on the currently employed freemium model, charging for enhanced, tiered and incremental items, services and add-ons to add value to the online gaming experience." he added: "the playstation plus program provides great incentives for subscribers, and sony can get more revenue from advertising, item transactions and specialized services to enhance specific aspects of online gameplay such as custom content and rules for use for individuals, guilds and other groups.
ps3 has to rewrite entire code(relative to certain aspects of game or os) for games or os in updates, whereas 360 updates are incremental and simply add new data.
30-40 mins average for a 1.8-1.9 gb demo.
all dependent on number of people using service and your network at time id imagine rather than live or psn sony made the psn free this gen as an incentive to buy the machine over the xbox, they gave up on the chance of bringing in millions to try and gain more market share.
register or log in not got an account?
puts paid to the free online for everybody claims.
whether you prefer whats on psn over live and vice versa is generally just a matter of taste really.
analysts get paid to talk, they have to say something even if it's not true or retarded i feel sorry for those broke ass ps3 fanboys who say ps3 is better than xbox because its free to play online!!
"providing networked services for online gaming is not inexpensive, and charging for these services would help sony defray those costs.
66 comments so far...
i have to disagree here i dont often play on the ps3 (cant get used to the controller as the pc uses 360 pad) but the value for money you get with ps+ is great, i dont recall getting any games free from ms even on the pc lol from ps i have a few free games the kids like, altho i have to admit home is a parents nightmare my 9 yr old daughter went on it for 5 mins and that has now been removed i would like the reward system xbox offers for purchases on the psn etc thought this was interesting till i read that it was yet again patcher sticking his nose in, can someone tell me when this guy is ever right.
and it's online services together are better, then i'd say fine, because together as a package it's much more refined, but the idea that you think you're paying for chat, updates to be quicker etc is just plain wrong.
i know people out there wont agree with me, even if they know i have a point and thats fine.
i wouldn't be happy if i suddenly couldn't access vidzone and the like without paying.
this sound a far better idea for making more money from the psn service.
this article simply speculates that they might charge for other features beyond mp online, it doesnt even speculate about movie services, which by dint of their nature, it's unlikely they would charge to utilise these anyway.
next gen i think will be a different matter and both systems will be charging for their online services.
subjective, but if you think that, then it's clearly right for you.
if sony want me to pay for psn they will have to realy up their game for the ps4
i think that's why microsoft charge for it with live.
live *is* better than the psn...for the price of a game.
the pricing of retail games on psn for example is much beter than the 360.
i spend easily twice as much on a single night out.
that's plenty respectable.
why should the rest of us subsidise the big white elephant in the room!
sure online play free would be great but limiting too much what you can do from the psn store will p*** folk off.
but then that requires more online games to purchase, charging for demos is just idiotic and i cant see why a games publisher would actually support it £ for £ depending on price it'd be like a car dealer charging you £2k to go on a test drive before buying the car that you wouldn't get back or have taken off price the car
but since the games i want to buy for my ps3 will have no multiplayer(last guardian and the game from quantic dream)
email: news@cvg.co.uk from £29.95zavvi
how are they 10years behind?? are you talking about features?
excuse me, i have no problem with 3 lol vodafone on the other hand.....
the same still applies to live, except youre paying for live and an online pass.
features of the os however are much better on xbox.
but they won't and what could they strip down already for free online mp?
mr patcher seems to get paid to create sound bites to fuel forum hits which in turn increases advertising revenue for the forums, i'm pretty sure he has shares in these advertising companies.
i shall be just fine .now
by tom ivan for computerandvideogames.com sony could strip down its existing free playstation network service to offer multiplayer gaming alone at no cost.
downloading updates are s**te on ps3, but never had issues downloading demos etc, bc2 vietnam a 1.8gb download was done in about 30 mins, and ive had smaller games on live take longer than that.
but that isnt due to psn , is it?
maybe have more of the 1hour game trials that are featured on psn+
they have tried to recoup some of this through the ps+ scheme.
this is also why ps3 cant do x game chat, as the operating system is bloated and uses too much ram to leave enough free for chat.
plus japanese public arent really into mp online in same way west is, wouldnt really work there to charge for mp content unless you purchase your games pre-owned and then you have to buy an online pass.
what confuses me is around the internet people are always calling for sony to charge for the psn online play, there are regularly articles about it and forum comments along the same lines, but these calls from people wanting to pay more money seem to strongly out weight the comments that live online play should become free.
i agree ps3 updates are laughable, but that's again not to do with psn or live, but to do with os.
sony has forecast a massive $6.4 billion loss for the financial year just ended and, in a bid to reverse its fortunes,it plans to make its digital imaging, game and mobile offerings "the three main focus areas of its electronics business".
can't believe your 26!
sony are 10 years behind xbox live & ms in terms of infrastructure, best thing for them to do in the current climate with all the losses they have incurred recently is to get a partner like valve and run steam on the next system, they have the network expertise to make it a success.
why in the gaming world are people always moaning gaming is too expensive, games are priced too high, consoles cost too much, but these same people are happy to pay for live and even want the same sort of fee introduced on psn as well i feel sorry for those broke ass ps3 fanboys who say ps3 is better than xbox because its free to play online!!
i dont usually bother with many demos
i barely play the 'free' games they provide as not all float my boat, but with the discounts, early access to betas and the automated system update feature....never going back.
considering the low quality of the psn which by the way was supposed to be called sopa or something they must be joking.
sadly it isn't not only for stuff like updates, beacons and chat but also because it's app catalogue is not as good, it's laborious to use, home is a mess and it doesn't have as many good arcade exclusives imo as live.
sure it pays for servers
i feel sorry for those 360 players who pay for something ps3 players get for free.
they're already monetised through advertising.
i only have 10mb virgin optical service but have low ping speed and my connection is always or nearly always good enough to be host in most situations.
so the differnce would be that people would not have access to demos unless they paid?
i pay for live for the kids to watch sky as it is cheaper than paying sky for the additional box in the house altho now i pay for ps+ and live for no reason as the kids wanted pc's instead although did get shift 2 for the ps3 today for free as well as shank 2 (havnt had that sort of thing from ms tho)
psn is a shop front for the downloadable content, why would you lock the doors?
i also think the system design is in larger scale of things better on 360, as it is easy for devs to utilise and thus cheap and quick to develop for, but i'm sorry, if you are telling me that live is better in anyway, then youre wrong.
to all in the petty arguement about live being better because you pay for it.
the article is very mixed as is sony going to do a lite version of multiplayer with ads everywere etc and the fee buyers get everything i feel sorry for those broke ass ps3 fanboys who say ps3 is better than xbox because its free to play online!!
thought this was interesting till i read that it was yet again patcher sticking his nose in, can someone tell me when this guy is ever right.
you can feel free to look at any of the forums for those games and find numerous threads about the issues.
