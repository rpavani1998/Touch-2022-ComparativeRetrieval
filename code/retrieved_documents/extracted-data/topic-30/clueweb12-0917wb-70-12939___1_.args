( as does ps3) 3) have a lot more ram and a much larger hd to allow more games to be installed, faster data access and assist with graphics.if consoles simply do not have that major jump in game quality and quantity that i personally want in ai, physics and animation, i won't even give a seconds thought in dismissing them.a christmas 2013 release date would givethe wii u 12-18 months unchallenged (depending on when they launch) as the most powerful console on the market by some margin, which i really can't see happening.microsoft's sdk will surely make their platform easier than sony's to develop for again though.the speculation / rumours around using arm based cpus seems pretty exciting though having a single core for different game functions (e.g. 4 to 8 cores) could end up being pretty weak compared to - say - sony's speculated 32 core ps4 cell processor.i've also said previously that halo 4 would be a great title to launch a new console with.the gap between the capabilities of pc and consoles at the moment is huge (a point illustrated perfectly by battlefield 3), and its going to get bigger yet again in early 2012 when nvidia release their kepler cards and amd release their 7000 series cards.i hope they do release the 720 next year, waiting until 2013 would only give sony the chance of releasing first, not to mention giving the wii u a free run for a year.launching both consoles within the same month would be fantastic in my opinion.but that would need more open architecture, proper adoption of usb and the ability to playback most video and audio codecs, which would seem to be something they're very reluctant to do.it would be disaster for many gamers who already own piles of 360 games and those who do not have fast internet to download something that's taking lots of hdd space.i think we can take phenomenal graphics and great online features as a given.if they end up just being something of a social hub for technology and online gaming, they can bugger off.gaming as a whole seems to get distracted and ends up going a different route that i wanted with each generation.setting it up and streaming all the stuff off it is a doddle, although you don't want to do it with a wireless connection on either device - the input lag on the menus in media centre is awful.
