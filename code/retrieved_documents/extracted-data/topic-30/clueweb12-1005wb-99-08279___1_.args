the number of new services on offer and the quality of the interface are astounding.microsoft aren't forcing you to buy it or use it, they're just making sure developers are including functionality for it for the people who have splashed out on one and in such are rewarding their customers by ensuring full functionality of the product.so what they are doing is making sure kinect users have an experience that is consistent and well designed.it's been an absolute joy to use the new gui with kinect voice commands; it is genuinely state of the art which ain't bad on a console that's on it's seventh birthday.it's also good for universal intuitiveness.but it is a great way to navigate menus and get more from your console experience.according to kotaku, microsoft has confirmed that anyone wishing to publish their content on xbox will need to include controls for that little sensor bar before it's given a green light.it means that ms have minimum requirements for the user interface that the developer must meet.apps requiring kinect functionality doesn't mean users need to have kinect.i've had a 360 since 2007 and enjoyed it but if this happens i'll be leaving xbox for good.people on here, and a lot of gamers in general actually, act as if any changes to consoles that don't involve beefing up hardware specs or frame rates are the work of the devil, pedophiles and bobby kotick working together in some kind of coven.- report this post reply with quote alan666 on 10 dec '11 said: the new dash seems to work pretty well when using kinect, the only issue with it though is that you have to keep your hand in place for to long while the circle fills in for it to accept the instruction, it seems to take about five seconds but that takes to long when it takes less than a second to click when using the normal gamepad, just some edit function would be ok where you can adjust the amount of time it takes.the latest gaming news, reviews, previews & movies sign up to access exclusive gaming content, win prizes and post on our forums.kinect should not be forced upon you, it should be optional, just like move on ps3.if a new console, game or service comes out no one complains about it bein "rammed down their throat" bit, apparently ms making a unified kinect ready experience is somehow a bad thing.
