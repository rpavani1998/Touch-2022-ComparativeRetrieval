in particular, 4-player co-op in the online campaign is what will make the game super fun and give it unlimited replay value.the beast mode is the same thing; it gives unlimited replay value.the way the horde mode uses so much strategy now provides incredibly deep game play.they've matured beyond schwarzenegger-calibre dialogue and mindless set-pieces and developed some genuinely interesting characters, wrapped in a low key yet personal and compelling plot.but more importantly, it's the high-quality game play that makes me want to play the game as soon as possible!i may be wrong, they may have brought a lot more to it, but neither of these games are particularly exceptional in terms of gameplay - very good, solid games but gameplay wise they're not top of the tree for me (although i do love my co-op games).instead it maintains the entertainment factor via a constant stream of variety; in one mission you might be fighting off locust goons on a boat, the next you're down to base weapons in the jungle and fending off a pack of tickers attempting to run off with ammo and pick-ups between their fangs.i don't think you can expect to get those extra high scores (i.e. 9.5 etc) on the third game in four/five years in a series where the game hasn't really changed very much and you're just shooting slightly different enemies in environments that look slightly different.but i just think uncharted 3 could be an exceptional case - it really does look unbelievable, and i have complete faith that naughty dog will provide the goods.for pc gamers with no consoles, they lose out.seems a tad harsh to crack down on it merely for preserving the simple unbutchered and slightly refined gameplay fans demanded.it's a stellar compilation of everything the developer's learnt from five years of hugely acclaimed instalments, and polished to perfection thanks to an extra year in construction.it's hard to change these games too much without loosing what makes them what they are, but i personally can't realistically rate a game that little bit higher that makes it goty type stuff when it's the basically the third instalment of a very similar game.i know many will say this is pointless but secretly we love comparisons if we have a preference console gaming and when uncharted 3 is released, its inevitable that declarations of who really owns the king of third person shooters will emerge and i can't wait.maybe i'm wrong, maybe we should just rate games on their own efforts and forget what came before.
