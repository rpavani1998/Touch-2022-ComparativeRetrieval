the courses are well designed, as expected and the replay value is certainly there.the graphics are nice and the physics have (thankfully) been left as they were.it's nice to know that despite complex design, nothing is taken too seriously.like real life, there's no jump button; getting airborne is a case of rider positioning, momentum and trajectory.it's a downloadable track and is rather hard, but very fun to try with some hilarious results on crashing.i know this wouldnt hold my attention for long, but if i still had a 360 i know id be tempted to buy this.graphically it is better with more going on (though i do miss the closed in feel of some of hd's tracks) and the online is great fun though clearly puniches you if you ain't got the hang of it yet.the review says "it's mastered over dozens of hours, but controls with two buttons - the left stick balances your rider and the right trigger revs.developers redlynx hasn't changed the physics a jolt since their 2009 two million-seller trials hd, and thank god for that because it's technically perfect.i'm sure the viewing angle is different to trials hd, making it more difficult see where the jumps are.i ordered points from the microsoft store nearly 2 weeks ago specifically for this game and they still haven't arrived yet.either way i can't wait to download and play this - definitely the best xbla game to date and probably better than a lot of full price big budget games too!!!it's mastered over dozens of hours, but controls with two buttons - the left stick balances your rider and the right trigger revs.i loved trials hd so much and after seeing all the new content, global sharing and robust editor in evo i picked it up no question.evolution's entirely less punishing than before, except for about ten later levels designed for veterans (abandon hope - inferno returns).
