i feel the same way as all of the nay sayers, but have great games and they will come.
no dvd, bluray or cd playback.
psvita can play ps3 games (soon) over the internet
if it's moving to cart or flash media in addition to download like the vita then perhaps it might be okay, but a 50gb flash drive is going to cost a fair bit more than a disk.
if games go download only then we're going to need big bloody hard drives!
having to constantly delete old games and, if you fancy a "quick" go of an old game, it'll take around 8-10 hours to load as you redownload it....
blu - ray is more than adequate which is a major plus point of owning the ps3.
for 5yrs of ps3 gaming i've never had an issue with any blu-ray disc.
beyond that we do not comment on rumors or speculation.
"if true, microsoft's digital move would usher in a new era for home games consoles and represent a major blow to the games retail market.
makes sense to be honest as in the past solid state forms of memory has been the ceiling on how far cartridge consoles could go when they bowed out with the n64.
the console itself will probably be a lot cheaper to produce, and so will probably draw buyers by buying the console, and then they have no choice but to buy the understandably expensive games.
it's always a little nicer when responses are polite too.
i wouldn't worry 2nd hand games will become far more scarce anyway when the highstreet stores go bang, which according to most on here is a good thing.
the whole second hand market is wiped out with ease !
it won't play films unless the disk is basically 100% clean - no dust, no slight finger prints at all... the 360 has form for scratching dvds and makes a racket and a drive is just another moving part to to break down...
as long as prices aren't bat s**t crazy like they currently are on consoles then it's all good digital distribution is a good thing, and alot of people are using it more and more as time goes on ...
my wii wouldn't read certain discs either and nintendo had to replace the drive.
and piracy doesn't matter what the media the content is delivered on, its about the protect the hardware / software offers that matters, nds uses cards and was been hacked wide open, ps3 uses discs and has very little piracy.
and as technology moves on, then in the not too distant future that £4-£8 pricetag will probably apply to the 16gb sd cards, then the 32gb ones not long after that.

ultimately it won't matter what type of hdd you have beyond it loading and copying quicker on a ssd, as you'll be downloaing it to your drive from the net, or copying it from a memeory card, copying it from a optical drive etc.
shame you have those issues with the blu-rays.
*sigh* i'm tired of the micro-control schemes of the gaming industry and personally i'm just about ready to walk away entirely.
been a loooong day you wouldn't have got a 512gb ssd for £200.
reason i'm wondering is because i fail to see any benefit for us consumers.
but i'm sure they'll think of some horrible build quality issue.
i don't want a download only console, but from a durability point of view i'd rather less optical media.
less moving parts means less things to go wrong.
i got an email from aria i think it wis with a 512gb ssd (crucial) for the 200 note mark i think so thought hmmm they have come down heaps since i built my rig a year ago.
i dunno i'd much prefer to carry on being able to play my dvds, cds and blu-rays on one machine and really am hoping for backwards compatibility this time.
they could implement a check and update type system on the new carts.
hopefully not the end of physical media though, just the end of scratchable discs.
devs could make a game on a 2gb card or 32gb card but the price disparity between the two must be huge.
this still will be cartridge media ,as the old carts we used to use were only rom type.(they could only be read,not written to).so
that's according to mcv, which says microsoft has been briefing partners under what sources describe as "the strictest nda" they have ever encountered.
wouldn't using sd cards make it more like 3ds.
ms will only f**k the customer over if they think they'll make money out of it, i doubt they'll be greedy if they don't see it working out for them overall.
if true, microsoft's digital move would usher in a new era for home games consoles and represent a major blow to the games retail market.
however i do have my fears for pre-owned and the price all these mediums are gonna cost, ms and sony have a habit of really overcharging for space.
and it will lead to some people boycotting the console entirely... couldn't see them using say a standard sd card for this, it will be its own type made by microsoft, bluray is good technology
lack of blu-ray makes sense.
itmight happen but it's not guaranteed to happen - much as various publishers, developers, and others might not like to think it there are people who will happily pirate a game yet will not purchase it even if they can't pirate it.

massive hard drive(s) and downlaod only (if prices nae mental) would suit me fine if that's fit they are doing.
read the whole text first "offer compatibility with some sort of interchangeable solid-state card storage, although it is not known whether this will be proprietary or a more standard format such as sd".
this would also imply no moving parts to console ruling out many avenues of failure and allow consoles to regain some green credentials as these types of format use much less power than conventional hdds or the power used to spin, read and translate discs.
good point about the backwards compatibility of the discs though.
oh but my internet connection took 3 days to download resident evil 4 thinking about it ms ditching discs makes sense if they want to stop pre-owned games as rumours suggest as they will be able to write data to the card and kill it from being used in another console.
i ain't even put a ssd in my rig yet so not to up on pro's n con's.
the site claims the console will "offer compatibility with some sort of interchangeable solid-state card storage, although it is not known whether this will be proprietary or a more standard format such as sd".
well, if that turns out to be the case, and i'm not saying it will be, but if it does turn out that way, then i will not be an early adopter.
i have unlimited broadband, i use steam and have a s**t load of games on it, my hard drive handles them fine and downlaoding new games is quick enough.
if the hardware was proprietary it would take a long time to hack.
our broadband infrastructure is nowhere near ready for a digital only console and to think it is would be madness.
but as has been said, there will be so little piracy and pre-owned games, ms could probably afford lower profits on the games.
only people who are brainwashed would buy it.
but that's another argument and one that not 1 person can produce any facts or evidence to say if it'll create more sales or not.
kinect shows how good ms are at brainwashing people though doesn't it, maybe they are encourage by how well they manage to pull the wool over people eyes with that device that this seems a doable move to them.
the site claims the console will "offer compatibility with some sort of interchangeable solid-state card storage, although it is not known whether this will be proprietary or a more standard format such as sd".
of course some exclusively buy flac and mp3's.
a lot of peoples issues are with not having enough money.
and getting a lot of data on yer drives if it is download only.
beyond that we do not comment on rumors or speculation."
ipods is just a nice portable device.
on a more neutral note it would most likely kill off the pre-owned market, ending the need for online passes - hopefully.
i will never buy a digital download only console because i like boxes and physical media, on my shelves are rows going back to the snes era never say never.
why will there be less piracy and less pre-owned games, surely the cards can still be sold on (unless blocked through software which could easily be done with disc).
well, *if* this report turns out to be true then it looks like i shan't be purchasing the next ms console or any other console that goes the digital-only route.
cartridge gaming mark 2 is arriving.
and as with most business models the end consumer usually ends up bearing the brunt of increased sales costs - i expect the same to be the case here if true, though perhaps a shared burden of increased cost between consumer, developer/publisher, and ms might be a hybrid possibility.
and next gen's will be even bigger.
people with less than 8mb download far outweigh the ones who have over 8mb download in the uk.
it will flop...badly.
i don't think i could continue gaming if it goes digital, as you're just buying fresh air.
as other people have mentioned without a disc drive there's less to go wrong (my brother constantly complains that his 360 can't read a number of his games - he had an awful time with a new copy of saint's row 3 not working properly) and it also would read the data considerably faster.
so, it would force brand new sales, but that is very blinkered of course.
seriously i've not had 1 disc error since i've had my ps3, but then i've never had a single finger print on my discs and if there's a spec of dust i blow it off before putting in my console.
voodoo - i don't think ms are that stupid.
and pre-owning could be reduced by making it so when a game is played on a console, it can only ever be played on that console, unless you pay for some unlock, when a disc can not be modified, it's the console itself that remembers if a game has been played, the cartridge could easily have modifiable parts.
well to be honest mate, all the brs i've watched have come via lovefilm.
microsoft don't want to hand a chunk of their profits to sony each time......
on the more negative side you lose out on backwards compatibility with disc based xbox 360 and xbox games - though your pc might be able to play them soon if those windows 8 rumours are true.
maybe storing saves and your profile for playing on a mates machine.
the industry is not ready for this.
still i've put muckier dvds and cds in various players over the years and generally they weren't as bad as my experience with br discs.
my 3 ps3s have never had a single disc read error.
then all sony has to do is have a disc drive and they've already wrapped up next gen.
wis thinking maybe it is solid state storage but on a bigger scale if they really are going download only.
knock your console over with a disk and its f**ked beyond repair, the same cant be said for sd cards etc.
the worlds infrastructure just isn't ready for download only games of this size.
i was wandering if they got the report right.
it wouldn't surprise me if they did.
having boxes and discs mean jack s**t to me 'cus i ain't a mental hoarder.
i like my next gen console rumours to be served with a big steaming mug of arse gravy.
" certainly implies that this move will effect retail and represent a new era in home consoles implying digital only.
i wis talking about a few years away, i just can't see it coming out in 2013 epsecially if it's downlaod only.
also, all sony has to do is not do this, & they will destroy ms next gen.
i get to watch films in the best quality without having to purchase yet another device for the living room.
if the x720 doesn't have a disk drive, i promise all of you, that i will eat my own head.
no disk tray is a great idea considering the constent disk read errors i got on my old 360.
maybe the carts will be snes shaped.
next thing you'll be telling me is that i wont be listening to tapes or cd's on the bus journey into work!
i have to eject discs out of my ps3 pretty often, mainly films though and bf3.
if bought in bulk, we are probably talking considerably less.
good thing about blu-ray discs is that they are really hard to scratch unless you purposely scratch them with a sharp object.
it wont be download only, id bet good money on it.
having to cope with 50gb downloads on the uk's 2.5mbps average, or buy games on hugely expensive memory cards.
power consumption probably would be lower and they could make the unit smaller.
mind you, somebody at ms thought that dashboard was a good idea, so this just might be f**king stupid enough to be true.
dd would kill the used market though.
i will never buy a digital download only console because i like boxes and physical media, on my shelves are rows going back to the snes era
but i've noticed with the ps3 its just really really slow for some reason, atleast with these mediums of cartridge we wouldn't need to worry about install times and transfer speeds between data and the console and loading times could be near enough wiped out, atleast very quick, the pcs are rapid at loading games when they come from the hard drive most of the time, it might be a tad expensive but if were honest which brand new console isn't?
this could mean the console will be smaller also.
unless they have more than 3 brilliant games i think most people would pass unless they are super hardcore.
thinking about it ms ditching discs makes sense if they want to stop pre-owned games as rumours suggest as they will be able to write data to the card and kill it from being used in another console.
my blu ray games/films have thrown up the odd error when not clean, even in my ps3.
i've read a few things about the br laser dying on ps3s, but still working on dvd etc - i did read somewhere about having it vertically causing problems - my ps3 was hot when it was vertical!
heck, as it stands i only buy a fraction of the games i used to on an annual basis due to this sort of crap and gaming fatigue in general.
you've a point about moving parts though, they are exposed for more wear and tear.
so i don't see how hard it would be for them to do that.
can see in a few years my dvd collection gone too.
to again choose to have no bluray player seems crazy to me.
i would have loved blu ray - and hope it will also be an option.
only problem would be the increased manufacture cost as has already been said.
it wouldn't be microsoft if they didn't.
you cant be downloading 3gb for every game.
i really don't wanna be p**sing about wi memory cards.
cost of manufacture would be considerably higher than a dvd - at least initially, but mass producing millions and millions of these cards would reduce that right down.
halo finished with reach and gears of war and mass effect is over.
granted, getting used to new things can take a bit of time but it just strikes me as being more cluttered now.
while it hasn't impacted the console gaming world (yet) in quite the way it has impacted the pc gaming world, requiring online connectivity to activate and play a game (even constant internet connectivity - i'm looking at you ubisoft) isn't unheard of even now.
yeah i mentioned that later on in my post just sounds like games may come on memory cards like with the 3ds and vita.
streaming like onlive would be welcome too...
how is ms offering a physical and digital version of software different to what we currently have with the ps3 and 360, the only real difference if this is true is that the physical games will be offered on sd type cards rather than optical disc, a bit like the vita.
by tom ivan for computerandvideogames.com xbox 720 will launch next year without a disc drive.
i'm with a major uk isp and get a monthly limit of 40gb.
if this is download only, then this will be ms's last console.
the storage size of games cards i expect will be variable.
unless they brought out the hardware for super cheap and made it a subscription type arrangement.
if you can get an 8gb sd card for £4 strap 10 of them together, voila 80gb storage for the cost of maybe a 32gb card on it's own, in a home console, it's not like the "cards" need to be really small, they can just use old, cheap tech, i doubt anyone will care if the cards are the size of nes, megadrive or n64 carts, if 8gb cards sell for £4 you can assume they are a lot cheaper to produce.
people will still buy cds.
i think cartridges or cards would work well next gen.
in turn it would kill off the rental market as well - not so good.
to be fair though, the article makes it sound as though ms is considering using memory cards which i suppose technically is a feasibility although i imagine that sd cards are more expensive to manufacture than discs.
not had an issue with my 360 in terms of reliability, although it gouged a massive circle in halo 3 when my housemate moved it, and of course it sounds like a f**king train!
disc read errors are a cd/dvd thing.
but if that was true their console will be dead on arrival.
and in many cases, they are prolific in this activity...
that would allow ms to keep check and control of who has first hand games and who doesn't.
where the cartreads a unique encrypted key that's stored on the console(like the system used today,(but obviously, a disc can't update itself) ,then the cartwrites this info to the game cart and updates itself to be locked to only this console .simples
so goodbye microsoft you money grabbing evil cu*** i will never buy a digital download only console because i like boxes and physical media, on my shelves are rows going back to the snes era isn't this what people said about ipod's?
what games developer is going to want to lose money because people do not have the bandwith to download their game thus losing out on a sale?
broadband technology needs to improve alot first.
bad news for backwards compatibility, good news for loading times.
faster read/write speeds, no used games, much more expensive games, very little piracy.
but i think the blu-ray drives have been one of the most reliable drives i've dealt with.
we don't need next gen yet but with that been said i can just buy the next gen consoles when i feel the need to do so.
if true, microsoft's digital move would usher in a new era for home games consoles and represent a major blow to the games retail market.
even digital downloads are immune to piracy, itunes is currently the main source for high quality hdtv rips in the piracy scene.
solid state drives will make no difference, they could just as easily put the games on a regular hdd and the key thing is how you get the actual game onto your console.
any disk can have a read error, theyre caused by marks, scratches etc on the bottom of the disk.
i dunno really far my thinking wis going lol wasn't putting individual games on each drive but more the read/write speed.
it was the first thing that came in to my head instead of sd cards.
what would be a new era for home consoles is if they did away with the physical media and sold only digital downloads, but even then the digital only era has already been kicked off with the albeit poor systems like on-live or psp-go.
on the surface that logical argument seems to make sense, but it runs afoul of the same issue that the current anti-piracy enthusiasts do time and time again: not being able to pirate a game does not automatically mean there will be an increase in sales.
the publisher - in return for each memory card being locked to one machine, so zero second hand sales will compensate them.
not forgetting too that the £4-£5 pricetag for an 8gb sd card is the price the end consumer pays.
you'll need at least 512gb if you're storing all your games on them, the benefits of ssd would be wiped out by the relatively massive cost - a regular 500gb drive is about £60.
having vita diskless makes sense, having a proper console doesn't, and won't for a long while, not while most people are stuck with internet speeds lower than 10mbps.
i would not put it past ms at all to sell memory card games that require online registration or even requires the downloading of a vital bit of code to make the game(s) run.
of course it will hav a disc drive.
a blank 32gb card costs a lot more than a blank blu-ray disc to manufacture.
we'll have to wait until e3 at least before they show their hand.
shorted the load times, which for a game like skyrim would be fantastic, and also remove the damage threat disks have.
and 512gb drives are still about £400 or thereabouts, so it's more likely to push the price up and be a hindrance as opposed to a bonus.
i really cant see this been true, ms would lose so many customers if they abandon physical media and they surely know that.
if you can get an 8gb sd card for £4 .
at least that person can still buy the game on disc and play it regardless of connection speed.
you're not going to sell games on individual drives, 120gb drives are still close to £100.
i will never buy a digital download only console because i like boxes and physical media, on my shelves are rows going back to the snes era isn't this what people said about ipod's?
beyond that we do not comment on rumors or speculation."
microsoft are moving towards the "media hub" style console and you've been able to play music and videos from your pc on your 360s for years.
10gb-50gb download is just not practical on most people's broadband.
