they all work perfectly exactly as described and my customers love them.great product just ignore the noobs who say they don't work, if you know how to solder even a little this mod is easy to install and comes with complete instructions and the tools required to disassemble the controller.i'd recommend this for a 10 year old kid to install its so easy.badges | report an issue | terms of service hello, you need to enable javascript to use intensafire controller mods for xbox 360 and playstation 3.i've probably done over 120 controllers now, all soldering, and only ended up with 1 defective intensafire.it doesnt get any easier than this, if you can't get it to work why not just buy a pre-done controller from ebay or something, youve already spent that much... views: 3 tags: share twitter facebook facebook - comment by patrick mason on september 7, 2010 at 11:27am - great to hear!so to the guy, maybe this posters attitude seems a little rude, but i would recommend buying the pre-soldered controllers first if you have any doubts about doing this modification yourself.it doesnt get any easier than this, if you can't get it to work why not just buy a pre-done controller from ebay or something, youve already spent that much... views: 3 share twitter facebook facebook comment by patrick mason on september 7, 2010 at 11:27am great to hear!
