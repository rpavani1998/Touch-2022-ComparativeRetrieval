the improvements are not going to overly effect multiplayer at the start, but the single player game could be so more immersive than what is even capable today.consoles can never be future proofed to everyone's liking, sticking a shed load of ram and cpu power into it on release is just going to make it expensive and unprofitable, microsoft and sony have struggled with that, only recently becoming profitable on hardware sales.they love the online connectivity, they have great communities and great libraries.for me it is enough it gets updated with better hardware to keep up with the graphic and offer developers more capability to do better games rather then optimizing all the time.developers need to fully know how to make a worthwhile experience with what we have right now instead of getting every ones and their own exaggerated hopes up that new tech is going to somehow spruce things up and give us something "better".i know exactly what i want in my next console and what i want it to do, and to have it at a price point that consumers will buy means it is at least two years away at the earliest.they're much longer, the online capabilities are making the way customers interact within the audience very different from when we went from psone to ps2.sure people are or rather can be connected but many people like myself (and friends) just hook up their console for some quality gaming time alone or maybe with their kids.i'm intrigued to see the next generation, i would welcome it warmly, i just don't want it to be released prematurely with less functionality, less advance in visuals et al and higher cost because of it.while i like my pc, i don't want to sit at a desk and play games, neither do i want to clutter up my living room tv unit with a pc, my console looks good and fits perfectly into my tv unit and is perfect for just casually picking it up to enjoy some great media or gaming titles that even my computer phobic wife is happy to pick up and turn on.i suspect that although there are advances to be made that will fundamentally change videogames (like mind control and all that jazz) they are few and far between and more time will be required to get them off the ground.i enjoy multiplayer just as much as the next gamer, but a really good single player game that you can get lost in is where it would be.fair enough much much larger games can be produced with better hardware and stuff like improved ai make for better experiences but the problem with that argument is that (a) they can still be realised the better skilled a developer is and (b) i do not want to pay for a new machine so soon if that's all i'm going to get.what is needed is more cpu power and ram, forget the graphics and focus on what would make for better games.i purchased my pc for video editing, music writing and graphics work, and i think that spending the sort of money on it for that purpose warrants it, however i am less convinced that buying a pc for games for the same sort of wedge is a sensible move, not that you wouldn't get superior graphics in many cases , it just doesn't seem sensible (or mature in a way).
