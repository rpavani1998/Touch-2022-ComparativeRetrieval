all of my friends have suffered from this s**tty hardware failure, i've spent Â£700 on hardware so i aren't taking my chances.i'm sure xbox 720 will come with some kind of kinect camera straight out of the box, so nintendo will really have to get a good footing to compete and have the processing power available to continue to compete for the coming 5-6 years.all peripheral devices should be totally wireless with a recharge method separate from the console.i think it would be better to hold off the new consoles for another couple of years so the drastic hike in performance we've seen between the other generations can be just as apparent in the coming generation.but you could also spend less time beating an old horse and more time being creative with a younger one i suppose microsoft is going to unify windows 8 with the xbox (8box?) which will make game developemnt and portability cheaper also.the integrated xbox live service launched in november 2002 allowed players to play games online.this gen's still going strong and i've got a lot of great games i can catch up on, meanwhile the new consoles can build up a library and maybe drop in price.this should also help the current gen consoles sell more with a hefty price drop!and if ps4 is released around the same time, hopefully the consoles will both be competitavely priced talking about abysmal ps3 hardware reliability, first of all and secondly, in a xbox thread ps3 is reliable.i do hope when it is released it is very powerful, lots of ram and a strong gpu, ai chip would be amazing and a physics chip.spending a tiny little bit more and putting 4-6gb of ram instead of 2gb could significantly lengthen the lifespan of the console.it makes better business sense to announce it at e3, the worlds biggest games expo.both the xbox and ps3 are flawed machines and are looking so ancient now.if wii u isn't at the very least sitting somewhere in the middle of these two generations then i fail to see it's appeal to current 360/ps3 owners with the new consoles coming within a year of wii u launch.either that or i'll just have to make do with a vita - i'm convinced it's a serious enough platform to fulfil each gaming genre i'm likely to play.
