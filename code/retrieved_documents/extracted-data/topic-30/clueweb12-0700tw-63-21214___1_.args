not only is pc gaming still around, it is actually flourishing and at current projections of growth in the pc market and the console markets (this does not take in to account release of a new generation of consoles) pc gaming is well on the way to once more dominate the gaming scene financially.our progress through a game should be driven via a strong narrative, just like halo:ce, and exploration should feel instinctive, inspired by a rich and imaginative world.we want to experiment with worlds that use complex physics, and by doing so, be able to approach gameplay in any style of our choosing.pcs are ten times more powerful than current consoles and already eclipse this standard.computer gamers will become more obsolete when the next gen consoles come out, they will have the same graphics at half the price of a pc gaming rig.we want games that are more intelligent and more interactive.if the always superior pc's can't offer any true innovations with all that power then there's very little chance of the ps4/362 offering anything truly innovative either.in collaboration with codemasters' lead artist mike smith and dead end thrills techmaster duncan harris, both magazines present a glimpse of the future: what ps4 and xbox 720 will be capable of in terms of visuals - but also what they'll be capable of in terms of scale, lighting, landscapes, ai and procedural generation.i'd rather pay for better interactive experiences with better stories, innovation and game design than high end graphics...oh, and backwards compatibility will have a huge influence on whether i get on board with the next generation of consoles or not.expand the concept of what a game should be and let us customize the way in which we want to play.on a personal note, the more realistic the game, the less interested i am in playing it.also, manufacturers have to remember that throughout the history of computer games, the most powerful console was never the biggest seller, as sales figures will show.but i don't believe the ps4/362 systems will offer anything truly original or innovative that can't be done already.but you just have to look at sales to see that 99% of gamers don't give a f**k and publishers are aware of this.
