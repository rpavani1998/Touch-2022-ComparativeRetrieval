publishers and the developers sell the game at a fixed price knowing that most people's use of the online services will diminish over time.as i said before, these companies price their games and budget their work and resources (both pre and post release) around the model of diminishing online play (overall).i've always thought games developers are well within their rights to try and make money from secondhand games, considering how much work goes into developing modern games.gamers that get their game pre-owned might still buy dlc, they'll be a lot more likely to buy any sequels new and the publishers have already been paid once for the online maintenance costs of any copy by the original buyer who got it new, i.e. pre-owned doesn't increase the number of copies so it can't increase the number of players potentially playing online at any one point.playing a used game single-player costs them nothing (well...arguably it does them out of some sales), but to continue to use online services without the developer seeing any money is wrong.i think the current model of allowing used games to play single-player for free and charge for an online pass is fair.buying second hand to play a game offline, directly p2p with no server assistance, or any other useage that doesn't require the developer to provide a service at a cost to them is fine and can all be deemed the "product".i'm in favour of pre-owned games, due to the fact that buying a video game means we own our copy of it and have the right to do what we want with it, including selling it.that said, i would argue that it is not necessarily the purchaser of the used game that is in the wrong, and it is the retailer middle-man who owes the developers a cut of their profits.developers and publishers get no cash whatsoever from the resale of their games.also when you buy an online pass you aren't even necessarily getting dedicated servers, you don't even know if you'll like the multiplayer of the game or whether it still has an online community because you don't get a chance to try it and if you're a 360 owner you've also got to pay for xbox live gold as well (which as far as i understand is also supposed to be covering 'online server maintenance costs').they have to, otherwise they would either have to continue to provide this service with no revenue stream to pay for it, or they would charge per month as per the mmo model.if that copy then gets sold on, their server usage doesn't diminish as expected without the additional revenue, and they start to lose money.but outside of that is a service, with the amount of effort that goes into making games these days, it's not fair to the developers and is ever more unsustainable.the problem arises when single-player games start using online passes, but so far we can't think up any examples of significant content being locked away behind online passes, it's all bonus dlc.
