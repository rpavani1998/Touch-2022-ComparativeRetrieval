that's what they plan for and that's why games are not a hell of a lot more expensive than they are.
to bring this back to your car comparison: once you drive away in a second-hand car, it doesn't cost the original manufacturer a penny.
if you've bought a copy you should be able to do what you want with it, including selling all of it on.
it was developed alongside the main game, they advertised it as part of the main game at e3 and then ultimately they left it off the disc to punish pre-owned gamers and leave offline gamers with no way of getting it even if they bought new.
obviously he chose the latter and was told that he'd have to buy an online pass to play over xbox live.
if anything, knowing our favourite publishers who just love money, they'll just use it for further expolits.
first off, developers have to pay for servers to run online games, which costs money.
cvg says: xbw hit the nail on the head, there's a strong argument to be made for having to charge so sustain servers for multiplayer games.
in fact, they'll still make money from you when you buy new parts for your second-hand car.

the gaming industry shouldn't get any special treatment when it comes to second hand games.
truth is the difference between the games industry and other industries is just that the games industry has found a way to try and get money out of second hand buyers and some publishers are happy to exploit it.
it's all well and good saying that the game preowned market should be treated like any otherproduct, but the multiplayer element is not just a product but aservice too.
i have no problem in developers making money from the games however they already have the full price tag when the first person purchased it.
it doesn't matter that they can fiddle with some code and thus artificially limit customers' access to their product - be it first or second hand.
i don't think that purchasers of these used vehicles, myself included, have had to pay the original manufacturers any money to have the engine start, the wheels to turn or for it to be driven out of the county.
these publishers need to get real.
no other service would work that way.
so, battlefield 3; fair enough, servers are expensive.
this week david anderson got in touch to draw an interesting comparison between the used video game market and the used car market and ask why customers are being charged for features that are part of the original package when buying used.
buying second hand to play a game offline, directly p2p with no server assistance, or any other useage that doesn't require the developer to provide a service at a cost to them is fine and can all be deemed the "product".
manufacturers have the ability to gain a little extra money from selling used cars through their own dealerships, not just independents.
but outside of that is a service, with the amount of effort that goes into making games these days, it's not fair to the developers and is ever more unsustainable.
as i said before, these companies price their games and budget their work and resources (both pre and post release) around the model of diminishing online play (overall).
i've always thought games developers are well within their rights to try and make money from secondhand games, considering how much work goes into developing modern games.
publishers and the developers sell the game at a fixed price knowing that most people's use of the online services will diminish over time.
we're not totally behind the 'online pass' system, but can see the sense behind it if the game in question justifies the expense.
i'm in favour of pre-owned games, due to the fact that buying a video game means we own our copy of it and have the right to do what we want with it, including selling it.
the game companies are acting like petulant, spoiled children that want everything their way.

the preowned market encourages higher use with no extra cash to pay for the service.
three or four people could potentially play the same copy of battlefield 3 (for example) online, but without the online pass system dice would only get the cash from one of them.
also when you buy an online pass you aren't even necessarily getting dedicated servers, you don't even know if you'll like the multiplayer of the game or whether it still has an online community because you don't get a chance to try it and if you're a 360 owner you've also got to pay for xbox live gold as well (which as far as i understand is also supposed to be covering 'online server maintenance costs').
you can also buy many other secondhand goods with no contribution to whoever made them in the first place.
also, the sale of a car through an independent dealer costs the manufacturer nothing at all, so unless you are comparing it to a single-player only experience then it doesn't mean the same thing.

developers and publishers get no cash whatsoever from the resale of their games.
i think this is especially important in the current economic climate.
if that copy then gets sold on, their server usage doesn't diminish as expected without the additional revenue, and they start to lose money.
no other industries do this.
it's perfectly legal, supports the bricks and mortar shops and is at worst a transfer of ownership.
i think this is especially important in the current economic climate.
they have to, otherwise they would either have to continue to provide this service with no revenue stream to pay for it, or they would charge per month as per the mmo model.
gamers that get their game pre-owned might still buy dlc, they'll be a lot more likely to buy any sequels new and the publishers have already been paid once for the online maintenance costs of any copy by the original buyer who got it new, i.e. pre-owned doesn't increase the number of copies so it can't increase the number of players potentially playing online at any one point.
in fact, they'll still make money from you when you buy new parts for your second-hand car.
no, there shouldn't be a charge to unlock features if you bought pre-owned, end of story in my book.

not only that these people help keep the online side of the game alive.

i wouldn't be that bothered about buying an online pass if it was a little cheaper 8 quid is a bit much, i used to enjoy browsing pre owned games, now i have to search every inch of the box to make sure it dosent have a pass, and if it does i then have to look for new, and once i realise the new copy is usually bout a tenner more i put the game back go home and find it cheaper than pre owned on amazon or ebay for brand new.
the problem arises when single-player games start using online passes, but so far we can't think up any examples of significant content being locked away behind online passes, it's all bonus dlc.
i have also noticed ever since with the online pass system has been in place, some new games (sealed) are cheaper than second hand games.
three or four people could potentially play the same copy of battlefield 3 (for example) online, but without the online pass system dice would only get the cash from one of them.
second hand is the proper word, once you get past the corporate b*****ks.

it might annoy you as a customer, but you would be far more annoyed if you were in their shoes - paying out for people to play games online when they haven't paid you anything.
they do not deserve special treatment and they should not receive any either.
if publishers want to be petty about 'online server maintenance costs' then i can be petty too.
i think the current model of allowing used games to play single-player for free and charge for an online pass is fair.

and they started burning discs, a lot of the time it isn't and bonus dlc is just a nice way of saying 'content we're holding back because we don't give a damn about our customers'.

however, it's obviously understandable that developers are annoyed by it as they don't earn any money for it, and of course in their eyes, if the pre-owned game market didn't exist, everyone would have to buy new copies.

that said, i would argue that it is not necessarily the purchaser of the used game that is in the wrong, and it is the retailer middle-man who owes the developers a cut of their profits.
playing a used game single-player costs them nothing (well...arguably it does them out of some sales), but to continue to use online services without the developer seeing any money is wrong.
