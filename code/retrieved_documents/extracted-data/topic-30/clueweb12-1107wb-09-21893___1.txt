check your work, check to make sure you're following the right instructions maybe you think its a cg controller but its actually a matrix, after 3 failed installs maybe you should wonder if its not the product but human error?

it doesnt get any easier than this, if you can't get it to work why not just buy a pre-done controller from ebay or something, youve already spent that much... views: 3 tags: share twitter facebook facebook - comment by patrick mason on september 7, 2010 at 11:27am - great to hear!

great product just ignore the noobs who say they don't work, if you know  how to solder even a little this mod is easy to install and comes with complete  instructions and the tools required to disassemble the controller.
@ the guy  who bought three kits and all failed: dude seriously you think 3 kits are  defective?
