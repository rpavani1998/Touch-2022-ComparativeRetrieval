i think sony would best benefit by continuing to build out on the currently employed freemium model, charging for enhanced, tiered and incremental items, services and add-ons to add value to the online gaming experience." he added: "the playstation plus program provides great incentives for subscribers, and sony can get more revenue from advertising, item transactions and specialized services to enhance specific aspects of online gameplay such as custom content and rules for use for individuals, guilds and other groups.sony are 10 years behind xbox live & ms in terms of infrastructure, best thing for them to do in the current climate with all the losses they have incurred recently is to get a partner like valve and run steam on the next system, they have the network expertise to make it a success."providing networked services for online gaming is not inexpensive, and charging for these services would help sony defray those costs.by tom ivan for computerandvideogames.com sony could strip down its existing free playstation network service to offer multiplayer gaming alone at no cost.if they want people to join up to the subscription service, then it needs to appeal to more people, not to mention needs more exposure as well, not to mention maybe also look at direct redeemable vouchers you can buy in store like a membership renewal for many other online services.it's host balancing code was horrendous, and anyone who was host was penalised horribly.that would make an enjoyable read, and show these people for what they really are.more downloadable games from the playstation back catalogue along with new release and an increase in the number of subscription services on offer seems like it would move psn and the playstation console forward rather than just copying ms and making a system wide online pass like live.sony are having huge financial problems and need to stop firing money (they are not earning from psn) at the ps network to keep it running.pachter:sony can get more revenue from advertising, item transactions and specialized services to enhance specific aspects of online gameplay such as custom content and rules for use for individuals, guilds and other groups.a demo is supposed to be there to encourage you to buy the game so charging for it defeats the object.new ceo kaz hirai's strategy outline indicates "the company also aims to increase sales by enriching its catalogue of downloadable game titles and subscription services available through the psn platform."i game mostly on my 360 and pay for it(even if i have the choice to play on ps3) and is just the better service for "me".whether it is the superior content of xbla (as well as the far cheaper pricepoints ), speed of download or the infinitely better chatting service it is well worth the purchase.if i pay Â£40+ for a new game then i expect to be able to play it online without having to pay anything extra.
