they all work perfectly exactly as described and my customers love them.
i've probably done over 120 controllers now, all soldering, and only ended up with 1 defective intensafire.

so to the guy, maybe this posters attitude seems a little rude, but i would recommend buying the pre-soldered controllers first if you have any doubts about doing this modification yourself.
i'd recommend this for a 10 year old kid to install its so easy.

it doesnt get any easier than this, if you can't get it to work why not just buy a pre-done controller from ebay or something, youve already spent that much... views: 3 tags: share twitter facebook facebook - comment by patrick mason on september 7, 2010 at 11:27am - great to hear!

great product just ignore the noobs who say they don't work, if you know how to solder even a little this mod is easy to install and comes with complete instructions and the tools required to disassemble the controller.
