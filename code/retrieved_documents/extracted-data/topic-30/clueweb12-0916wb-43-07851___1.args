"the games available at launch in japan do not correspond to the typology of the japanese public.

ah so sony have got there chequebooks out and said to capcom - gief monster hunter nowwww.

a bit of a re release with some new areas and extra polish will have fans in japan running to the game shops, and sony know it.
i don't know about that, the problem with games like mh and dq is that they sell to their userbase with in the first few weeks, 3rd has sold 4.7m already in japan so those who want it already own it they'll need to do something like release an extended version for vita, 3rd g, remember that many still have yet to buy vita due to price.
so the's no point putting the psp port on shelves.
cardone has also said sony isn't under pressure to announce the ps4 and 'will probably be last to announce something'.
i've seen the difference between the psp one and vita, it looks so much better on vita.
pretty sure it's out but as a download game as it's a direct port, the game in the bc version is the same game only you get a discount, the rumors in japan is that 3rdg will surface in japan in the coming months for retail
in an interview with le point cardon made a direct reference to the lack of a monster hunter title and went on to seemingly confirm when it will show up on sony's new handheld.
"had it been there right out in japan, the story would have been different.
when quizzed on the decline cardone said "the games available at launch in japan do not correspond to the typology of the japanese public," specifically calling out the lack of a monster hunter title and providing an assurance that the european launch would be better suited to tastes.
the game console at launch will be the european better than it was for japan.
they should have had the boxed version of hm on the shelf, sure it's in the store but they need it on show in the shops.
he's talking about monster hunter portable 3rd the psp game which also has a ps3 and vita version and has yet to launch in the west hence why he's talking about it being present at launch.
the game console at launch will be the european better than it was for japan."
on evenings and weekends he might be batman.
much like a nintendo system without a mario or zelda game, there is no point in a sony handheld without monster hunter.

excellent news for the psvita this watch the internet haters cry when this 'will' boost psvita sales 'big time' in japan lol;) i wouldn't put my trust in google translate to be accurate, he could have meant that they've missed out on not having monster hunter in the coming months as he doesn't say, "which will be out in the coming months" i'm sure monster hunter will come, unless nintendo paid capcom a king's ransom.

remember, in order to get 2 mhs on their system, nintendo had to make that ugly second stick...
they need to give capcom some cash me thinks.
