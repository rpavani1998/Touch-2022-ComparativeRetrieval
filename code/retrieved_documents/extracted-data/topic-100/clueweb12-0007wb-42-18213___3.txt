one of the problems in this process is that, regardless of the actions to be  done, the setup is always executed.
if you have more  than one type of the same kind of setup, things become verbose very quickly.

if you would like  to read more about python's 'with' statement, you can read about it at the main  python site or at  effbot.org.
similarly, with file objects, one can skip the file object assignment line and simply put in the 'with' statement.

for those of you  who are used to python's try...except statement, you may find this to be the  biggest boon of upgrading.

python 2.5 python's with statement one of the new features that was  released with python 2.5 last month is the 'with' statement.
the new 'with' statement cuts the code needed from 5 to 3 and makes the program a bit more readable for humans.
filein.readline() the new 'with' statement cuts the code needed from 5 to 3 and makes the program a bit more readable for humans.
if you have read my tutorial on inserting data into mysql databases, you may recall the class table.
