unlike too many beginner books, it never  condescends or tortures the reader with childish hide-and-seek prose games.
to hammer the concepts home, you will also find fun and challenging exercises at the end of every chapter.

learning the syntax is one goal of this book; however, we also believe that if you learn how python works under the covers, you won't just be able to program in python, but you will write more effective python applications even as a beginner to the language.
