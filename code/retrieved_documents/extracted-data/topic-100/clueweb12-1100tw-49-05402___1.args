data analysis training march 20, 2012 by prasoonsharma (this article was first published on enterprise software doesn't have to suck, and kindly contributed to r-bloggers)
exports, surveys, web scraping etc.
after completion of the course, you will be able to: understand concepts of data science, related processes, tools, techniques and path to building expertise use unix command line tools for file processing (awk, sort, paste, join, gunzip, gzip)
data-driven business functions e.g. mroi, mix optimization, ipl teams / fantasy teams, predictions - big data - definition: data sets that no longer fit on a disk, requiring compute clusters and respective software and algorithms (map/reduce running on hadoop).
- real big data problems: parallel computing, distributed computing, cloud, hadoop, casandra - most analysis isn't big data.
plot charts on a dataset class prerequisites good knowledge of basic statistics (min, max, avg, sd, variance, factors, quantiles/deciles, etc.)
- familiarity with unix os class topics a) intro to data science - explain data science and its importance.
- visualize data - interact with data (not covered here): bi tools, custom dashboards, other tools (ggobi etc.)
we will use r, a leading open source stats package.
i'm training some of my colleagues on big'ish data analysis this week.
why i started learning data science and picked r curriculum for intro to r (r has steep learning curve.
here you will find daily news and tutorials about r , contributed by over 300 bloggers.
familiarity with unix os class topics a) intro to data science explain data science and its importance.
story telling with charts - file handling: unix preferred.
- archive data (not covered here) c) skills needed for data science - statistics: concepts, approach, techniques - databasing: sql - scripting language: ruby, python - regex - visual design:
would love your ideas to make it better.
awk, gzip, gunzip, paste, sort etc. - office tools: excel (plugins like solver, what if) - statistical tools: r, sas, spss, stata, matlab, etc. - bi tools d) learning r we will pick a tool to learn the concepts of data science.
business apps often deal with datasets that fit in excel/access products: desktop tools (excel (solver, what if), access, sql, spss, stata, r, sas, programming languages (ruby, python, java) -- stats libs in these languages, bi tools, etc. b) steps in data science acquire data: "obtaining the data"... databases, log files...
- real big data problems: parallel computing, distributed computing, cloud, hadoop, casandra - most analysis isn't big data.
after completion of the course, you will be able to: - understand concepts of data science, related processes, tools, techniques and path to building expertise - use unix command line tools for file processing (awk, sort, paste, join, gunzip, gzip) - use excel to do basic analysis - write and understand r code (data structures, functions, packages, etc.)
books, conferences - analyse your favorite dataset: e.g. cricket data analysis - compete (kaggle) - learn other tools (excel solver, sas etc.)
tags: data analysis, r comments are closed.
reference tutorials - r intro - r fundamentals - r data methods - r-bloggers - web app integration - tbd books to leave a comment for the author, please follow the link and comment on his blog: enterprise software doesn't have to suck .

r-bloggers.com offers daily e-mail updates about r news andtutorials on topics such as: visualization ( ggplot2, boxplots, maps, animation), programming ( rstudio, sweave, latex, sql, eclipse, git, hadoop, web scraping) statistics ( regression, pca, time series, ecdf, trading) and more...
use excel to do basic analysis write and understand r code (data structures, functions, packages, etc.)
you can subscribe for e-mail updates: and get updates to your facebook: if you are an r blogger yourself you are invited to add your own r content feed to this site ( non-english r bloggers should add themselves- here)

- explore a new dataset with ease (visualize it, summarize it, slice/dice it, answer questions related to dataset) - plot charts on a dataset class prerequisites - good knowledge of basic statistics (min, max, avg, sd, variance, factors, quantiles/deciles, etc.)
