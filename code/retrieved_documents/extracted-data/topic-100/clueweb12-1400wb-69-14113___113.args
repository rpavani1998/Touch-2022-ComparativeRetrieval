you can find out the parent environment for an invocation of a function by using parent.frame() or sys.frame(sys.parent())
stop(paste("not all arguments are named:", env)) fargs 1) f[1:(length(f) - 1)] else null fargs - d g d b to start an inferior r process with arguments -d gdb.
of course, in the case of bug reports it would be very helpful to have code which reliably reproduces the problem.
in theory one could also use xvfb fromx.org, which provides an x server with no display.
parent environments are important because things like model formulas need to be evaluated in the environment the function was called from, since that's where all the variables will be available.
to install dvi, info and pdf versions of the manuals, use make install-dvi, make install-info and make install-pdf, respectively.
this is made clear in clause 6 (“no discrimination against fields of endeavor”) of theopen source definition: the license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a specific field of endeavor.
also, make sure that you include information on the system and version of r being used.

otherwise, you can compile and install r yourself, which can be done very easily under a number of common unix platforms (seewhat machines does r run on? ).
if you have a function that cannot handle two vectors but can handle two scalars, then you can still use outer() but you will need to wrap your function up first, to simulate vectorized behavior.
consider for instance the semantics in cases like d2 test1() 3 3.14 r> test2() 3 3.141593 what is really used is the global value of .options, and usingoptions(opt = val) correctly updates it.

argument names are also usually syntactic names, but again can be anything if they are quoted.
package gam from cran implements all the generalized additive models (gam) functionality as described in the gam chapter of the white book.
enclosing environments are important because a function can use variables in the enclosing environment to share information with other functions or with other invocations of itself (see the section on lexical scoping).
you can also replace \ by / ("c:/data/money.dat" ).
if the problem occurs when netscape is running, try (re)starting it with either the-no-install (to use the default colormap) or the -install (to install a private colormap) option.

one way to describe the scoping differences between r and s is to say that in s the enclosing environment isalways the global workspace, but in r the enclosing environment is wherever the function was created.
that way.gdbinit can stay in the directory with the code and be used to set up the environment and the search paths for the source, e.g. as follows: set env r_home /opt/r set env r_papersize letter set env r_printcmd lpr dir /opt/r/src/appl dir /opt/r/src/main dir /opt/r/src/nmath dir /opt/r/src/unixnext: r programming, previous: r and emacs, up: top you can use x[i] d(expression(x^2), "x") 2 * x although this behavior may initially seem to be rather strange, is perfectly logical.

whereas the resulting language is very similar in appearance to s, the underlying implementation and semantics are derived from scheme.
it really has nothing much to do with names in the language, but it is traditional to call these strings file “names”.
