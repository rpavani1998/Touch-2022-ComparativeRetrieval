its flexibility, widespread community support, and leveraging of legacy c and fortran code also make it an outstanding language for social science researchers.while not as robust asrepast or netlogo, simpy provides an excellent tool set for designing experiments, and because it is pure python, the data can be fed to other analytical packages.for novice social network analysts/graph theorist, the learning curve will be steep, but taking the time to learn nx will preclude you from having to waste your time withother inferior tools.that said, python is an extremely versatile and easy to learn language, so i would recommend focusing and building you skills there.this is the best tool for analyzing network data–period.to take advantage of its power, you will need a little background in html (or xml, if that happens to be what you are parsing), but there aremany tutorials available online to get you up to speed quickly.i’ve recently embarked upon a bit of complex networks research with a former colleague of mine and i am currently surveying the tools available so this article is particularly timely for me.this package is great for researchers who want symbolic mathematics support, but have no access to mega-expensive computer algebra systems, likemathematica.i am wearing my computer science background on my sleeve with this one, but for people serious about designing pure pythonagent-based models, pyevolve provides the tools to create intricate experimental environments.json ( javascript object notation) is useful for many things, but most notably for social scientist is how many social networking sites use json to encode public data about their users and their users’ relationships.if you need to download and organize large amounts of data from the internet in a quick and easy way, then html5lib is the only package you will need.this package contains efficient implementations of hierarchical and k-means clustering, with several options for measuring distance.to distinguish itself, scipy adds several of its own sophisticated data types, and integration and optimization techniques.pymc implements the metropolis-hastings algorithm as a python class, providing flexibility when building your model.i was looking into using the network workbench and gephi for most of my analysis, but i would love to have something like networkx that i could use from python just for the ability to automate much of the drudgery.
