the book's aim is to show scientists and engineers with little formal training in programming how python can make their lives better.it's a great achievement, and a great resource for anyone doing scientific programming.our solution is to let programmers search and update the database programmatically using multiple languages.the most important idea in this course - improving quality improves productivity - i.e., the tools and techniques you must adopt to produce better code alsodebugging with print statements is: error-prone: adding print statements is a good way to add typos particularly when you have to modify the block structure of your program to fit it in time-consumingthe results are impressive: female undergraduate enrolment at cmu rose by more than a factor of four during their work, while the proportion of women dropping out decreased significantly.this book describes the most useful data crunching techniques, explains when you should use them, and shows how they will make your life easier.the answer is to keep tests as independent as possible - the first tests you write use simple constructors, and simple inspector methods - once those pass, start writing more complex tests - they probably won't be executed in this order once they're all written… - …but they still give you somewhere to set a breakpoint when simple things start to go wrong - much more interesting to think about how to use object-oriented ideas in constructing tests - create one class that has a lot of tests - derive other test classes that: - create specific fixtures - run specific tests - by default, the framework will run all the generic tests for the specific classes as well - this only works if the tests in the base class are generalized - a little more setup work for a big payoff - example: billing application for a software consulting firm - each consultant may be assigned to zero or more projects - each project may have zero or more consultant currently assigned to it - the assignment class keep track of who is currently assigned to what - use strings for consultant and project ids for now - create a base class commontests to hold shared tests - do not derive this from unittest.this work proves that by being conscious of the many things that turn women off computing, and by viewing computer science from different angles, we can attract a broader cross-section of society, which can only make our discipline a better place to be.the better developers understand the product and the technologies it uses, the less risk there is of a lightweight design leading to nasty surprises - the greater the cost of delivering the wrong thing, the more detailed the design should be -if execution time is what we really care about, better to measure it directly - a statement that takes 10 milliseconds to execute is ten thousand times more expensive than one than takes a microsecond - profiling is the act of measuring aspects of a program's performance - typically measure execution time - can also measure disk usage, memory footprint, etc.it may not be glamorous, but knowing how to do it efficiently is essential to being a good programmer.what good fortran programmers were already doing - objects formalized the way good c, pascal, and lisp programmers managed their data structures and functions - java deserves credit for bringing two previously-esoteric practices into the mainstream - garbage collection: the computer recycles memory as it needs to - reflection: programs can inspect themselves at runtime - reflection simplifies the construction of large software systems - most big applications are now frameworks that load plug-in components dynamically - a little extra effort… - …but it forces programmers to really, truly modularize their code… - …which also reduces maintenance and customization costs - watching programs run is an essential part of the software development process - which parts of my code can be thrown away?in fact, because of cognitive dissonance, the person watching is much more likely to spot errors than the one typing - fewer errors translates into less time spent debugging - the earlier something is fixed, the cheaper the fix is - and pair programming helps ensure wider understanding of the system - more people able to work on more things - feels strange the first time you do it -doing a commit - ensures that what goes into the repository has at least some chance of being sensible - ensures that what other people add to the course will conform to style and usage rules - course materials include several other tools - re-run sample programs and check that the output stored in the lectures is still correct - translate lecture notes, glossary, and bibliography into html - extract summary values from each element to create html version of course syllabus - etc.
