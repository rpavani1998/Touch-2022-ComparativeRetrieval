readability is definitely a point which assists a programmer or even a non programmer who wants to learn and improve the code but doesnt have the technical competence in that language.python is a hybrid o-o language that is a good replacement for basic as a introductory tutorial language, yet has sufficient power to displace perl for many tasks in the perl domain.it provides an strict syntax that allows the compiler to remove thousands of trivial errors, and allow the novice programmers to have a more readable high level version than something written in c++, plus the portability.nowadays though, the programmer's time should be worth more than the computer's, so rapid development time and maintainability are key.meaningful syntax and well named intermediate variables are essential to writing code that is "intuitive".it's strength and flexibility makes it perfect for fast development/prototyping.modules, support, structure, community, and the internet/open source mentality are paving the way for great new computer ideas and languages, as well as changing opinion that programming is just for "geeks".python has more available for it than ruby at this time, and having a library to do what you want can make a big difference.the way to improve your programming is not by learning the intracacies of a particular language, but by learning many different paradigms.no one language is best at everything, even on a web application, so my conclusion is to learn them all and utilize them in their areas of strengths: perl for text manipulation, shell scripting for simple operations, ruby (most likely) for database integration.as someone who has worked in everything ranging from windows/vb -> solaris/java -> linux/php/perl, i have only found my skills getting stronger with each new task/project.i think that readable code is useful in a development team that has different programming skills.python and ruby both come with mac os x 10.2, both havebbedit language modules, and both promise a cleaner approach to scripting.it really helps saving time which would otherwise spent on programming quite simple things.so my advice to users (of any language) is to learn to document your code if you are concerned with readability.
