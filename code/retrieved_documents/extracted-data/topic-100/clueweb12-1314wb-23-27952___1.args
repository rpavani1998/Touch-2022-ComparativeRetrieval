we don’t have to write latex documents from scratch, and everything is intuitive in lyx. you can clearly see the structure of your document, as well as figures (instead of \includegraphics{}), tables (instead of the gory \begin{table} numbers 1.4 & 2.2 & 3.8), headings (instead of \title{} \section{}) and math formulae (instead of $\frac{\gamma}{\alpha_{ij}}$)…
pgfsweave will try to format your r code by default, e.g. add spaces and indent where appropriate when your source code is not well-formatted.
for example, i hate typing \item in an itemize environment each time i need a new item.
this is good because we don’t need to worry about the version numbers.
in the past, i did not like writing latex documents just because i hate wasting my time on typing the raw commands.
in all, it is a whole lot easier and faster to write latex documents in lyx. this is the main reason for an easier life of sweave, because a sweave document is nothing but a mixture of latex and r code.
although sweave in lyx is convenient to use, it is not a trivial task for beginners to configure and understand how it works.
i use command-line tools a lot every day, but i am still “gui-addicted”.
there might be some text editors which can automatically do this tedious task, but the more serious problem is i cannot see the whole picture — in my eyes there are only commands; my imagination is limited — it is difficult for me to imagine\section{} to be a section title.
this is good because we don’t need to worry about the version numbers.
" r can accept a string in its -e argument, e.g. yihui@xie:~$ r -q -e "rnorm(5)" > rnorm(5)
i did not add r’s texmf directory to the root directory of miktex; instead i copied all the files to the user directory of miktex (this can be a bad practice too)
you are still reading… so first you have to read gregor gorjanc’s paper in r news and that make most things clear in this blog entry.
i added another environment in lyx named scrapcenter, which is for the code chunks that produce plots, because plots are usually centered in the page.
however, lyx has provided a perfect solution to lazy people like me.
r-bloggers.com offers daily e-mail updates aboutr news and tutorials on topics such as: visualization ( ggplot2, boxplots, maps, animation), programming ( rstudio, sweave, latex, sql, eclipse, git, hadoop, web scraping) statistics ( regression, pca, time series, ecdf, trading) and more...
… i spent several hours on writing an r script trying to cover all these gory details automatically, so the configuration becomes as easy as source('http://yihui.name/en/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/lyx-pgfsweave-config.

beside the speed issues, a remarkable feature is the quality of graphics — it is unbeatable.
sweave.styto add line numbers to the code chunks in latex, and the real sweave style file i’m using is sweavex.sty.

a sweave document is dynamic in the sense that everything in the document can be changed by the r code (nothing is hard-coded), so we don’t need to worry too much about the specific numbers and plots in the output.
scrapcenter, which is for the code chunks that produce plots, because plots are usually centered in the page.
a few more things i need to add are: i modified the file literate-scrap.inc so that we can hit the enter key to start a new line in r code, which is more natural for the users, i think.
for those who do not know sweave well, a good place to look at is the help page?sweave .

how to start using (pgf)sweave in lyx in one minute october 30, 2010 byyihui xie (this article was first published on statistics, r, graphics and fun » r language, and kindly contributed to r-bloggers)
this will make the style of graphics completely consistent with the body of a document, e.g. the fonts.
but i have to confess it is a really nasty script — (for windows) it calls several system commands to help the configuration, such asinitexmf or mpm, or setx to set the system path variable; this is a dangerous practice and some users may feel extremely uncomfortable with it.
this will make latex know the style definitions for sweave.

the video below can give you an idea on what it looks like in lyx (chinese visitors please go to photobucket or 56.com to watch the video): as we can see, r code can be easily embedded into lyx. if you are familiar with sweave, you don’t even need time to learn anything.
by the way, i also like the nogin option for sweave.sty to be the default in pgfsweave, because i really don’t like the idea of setting the size of graphics by a latex macro\setkeys{gin}{width=0.8\textwidth} .
this packages uses the tikzdevice package to produce pgf/tikz graphics which are essentially latex code, in other words, the r graphics are represented in the latex language so that they are treated (compiled) in the same way as the body of a latex document.

configuration to make lyx work with sweave, we need to take these steps: put the latex style files such as sweave.sty under the texmf tree define the literate programming environment in lyx (literate-scrap.inc) and corresponding layouts (the critical step) create converters to convert sweave documents to latex (this is done in the preferences file) and the converter is like r -e "library(pgfsweave);pgfsweave($$i,compile.tex=false)" where$$i is a variable in lyx denoting the input file each step involves with several novel concepts for beginners.
while sweave is a great invention for reproducible research, there are other packages which can improve r’s default sweave functionality.
preferencesfile, with which i handled in a special way: if i could detect the sweave configurations in the old preferences, i will not do anything, otherwise i willappend the sweave configurations (converters) to the old preferences file.
i need to mention here that all the old configurations will be overwritten except the preferences file, with which i handled in a special way: if i could detect the sweave configurations in the oldpreferences, i will not do anything, otherwise i willappend the sweave configurations (converters) to the old preferences file.
under mac and linux, it tries to download and copy files to your home directory so that latex and lyx will work properly.
(i don’t want to comment more about microsoft word here.)lyx is a somewhat wysiwyg tool based on latex, and on the first time i saw it i decided that word was completely useless to me from then on.
it will do no harm to your system, but i need to warn you first in the spirit of “open source”.
to put it short, install lyx and r as well as a working latex toolkit such as miktex or texlive or mactex; run source('http://yihui.name/en/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/lyx-pgfsweave-config.
in the above video, i used a latex macro\sexpr{} to output the value of pi and i don’t need to write the specific number 3.1415926 there.
in the past, i did not like writing latex documents just because i hate wasting my time on typing the raw commands.
this is my suggestion (and contribution), and i think this makes sense because many users just do not care about formatting r code (hence torture other people’s eyes), so let’s do it automatically with pgfsweave.
i copied lyx configurations to the user directory of lyx as well.
although sweave in lyx is convenient to use, it is not a trivial task for beginners to configure and understand how it works.
i’m not using this approach in lyx, because this requires system admin privilege to install pgfsweave.
in pgfsweave, we just set the width and height naturally in the code chunk options like>=. pgfsweave comes with a command line usage like sweave
