these days, though, with all the extra power of computers since guido wrote python, perhaps we could do without the tuple.
if you want to perform an operation on element of a dictionary, you can find out the keys using the keys method print starter.keys() for example since you can't know what the elements are called just be looking at a count of the number of elements as you can with a list or tuple.
if you're familiar with perl hashes, php associative arrays or tcl arrays, then you have a good parallel to a python dictionary.
"cheese" for example if i want to replace the tuna.
you'll notice that when i created the list i used [...] notation, and when i created the tuple i used (....) notation, but when i refer to elements later i do so using square brackets every time.
nasty characters in web applications inheritance python list, python tuple, python dictionary python threads - a first example python calling functions and methods.
link - complete example usinga string as a tuple iterators an iterator is an object that generates a collection.
but if i write fruit[3] = "orange" i will get an error message when the program runs.
for example for line in huge.readlines(): will set up a temporary list containing all the data in the stream opened in object huge, then put each element into the variable line one by one.
at well house consultants, we provide training courses on subjects such as ruby, lua, perl, python, linux, c, c++, tcl/tk, tomcat, php and mysql.
increase the number of lines in the file by a factor of 10 or 100 and you're likely to find that you're starting to create "issues" on the host computer.

if you don't want to refer to the elements of a collection by their position number but prefer some other type of object as a key, you can use a python dictionary.
this is a very useful facility in certain applications - for example if you're using python in a bioinformatics application and you're doing sequence analysis.

if you set up a large collection (for example a list that contains all ten thousand lines from a data file), you're occupying computer memory ... and if the only thing you then do with it is process each element once, it's not efficient.
