otherwise, you can compile and install r yourself, which can be done very easily under a number of common unix platforms (seewhat machines does r run on? ).
if you have a function that cannot handle two vectors but can handle two scalars, then you can still use outer() but you will need to wrap your function up first, to simulate vectorized behavior.

why does the output from anova() depend on the order of factors in the  model?
one way to describe the scoping differences between r and s is  to say that in s the enclosing environment isalways the global  workspace, but in r the enclosing environment is wherever the function was  created.
“writing r extensions” (r-exts) currently describes the  process of creating r add-on packages, writing r documentation, r's system and  foreign language interfaces, and the rapi.
as r uses c-style string handling, \ is treated as an escape character, so that for example one can enter a newline as\n.

inside a function you may want to access variables in two additional  environments: the one that the function was defined in  (“enclosing”), and the one it was invoked in (“parent”).
as an example of how r can be used in teaching an advanced introductory statistics course, see d. nolan and t. speed (2000), “stat labs: mathematical statistics through applications”, springer texts in statistics, isbn 0-387-98974-9 this integrates theory of statistics with the practice of statistics through a collection of case studies (“labs”), and uses r to analyze the data.

the book j. c. pinheiro and d. m. bates (2000), “mixed-effects  models in s ands-plus”, springer, isbn 0-387-98957-0 provides a comprehensive guide to the use of the nlme package for linear and nonlinear mixed-effects models.
the parent  environment will be wherever the function happens to be called from.
many of the r project's mailing lists are also available via gmane, from which they can be read with a web browser, using an nntp news reader, or via rss feeds.
next:  why does the output from anova() depend on the order of  factors in the model?,
it consists of letters, numbers, and the dot and (for version of  r at least 1.9.0) underscore characters, and starts with either a letter or a  dot not followed by a number.
corrections to and comments on message translation should be sent to the last translator (listed at the top of the appropriate.po file) or to the translation team as listed at http://developer.r-project.org/translationteams.html.
the group currently consists of doug  bates, john chambers, peter dalgaard, robert gentleman, kurt hornik, stefano  iacus, ross ihaka, friedrich leisch, thomas lumley, martin maechler, duncan  murdoch, paul murrell, martyn plummer, brian ripley, duncan temple lang, luke  tierney, and simon urbanek.
this difference becomes manifest when free variables occur in a function.
then start gud (m-x gdb) giving the r binary (using its full path name) as the program to debug.
the name is partly based on the (first) names of the first two r authors  (robert gentleman and ross ihaka), and partly a play on the name of the bell  labs language `s' (seewhat is s?).
r is being developed for the unix, windows and mac families of operating systems.
- where have all the methods gone?
it requires  functions that are vectorized to work elementwise on arrays.
that way.gdbinit can stay in the directory with the code and be used to set up the environment and the search paths for the source, e.g. as follows: set env r_home /opt/r set env r_papersize letter set env r_printcmd lpr dir /opt/r/src/appl dir /opt/r/src/main dir /opt/r/src/nmath dir /opt/r/src/unix next: r programming, previous: r and emacs, up: top 7 r miscellanea next: how can i save my workspace?,
- why did my .rprofile stop working when i updated r?
the command 1+1 computes the value 2 and returns it; the command summary(glm(y~x+z, family=binomial))
the core of r is an interpreted computer language which allows branching  and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
- how can i capture or ignore errors in a long simulation?
often, it is desired to use the value of an r object in a plot label, e.g., a title.

there is also a large set of  functions which provide a flexible graphical environment for creating various  kinds of data presentations.
you can copy the  script to a place where users can invoke it, for example to/usr/local/bin.
simply add the  line deb http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian stable/ (feel free to use a cran mirror instead of the master) to the file  /etc/apt/sources.list, and install as usual.
we can regard s as a language with three current implementations or  “engines”, the “old s engine” (s version 3;s-plus 3.x  and 4.x), the “new s engine” (s version 4;s-plus 5.x and above),  and r. given this understanding, asking for “the differences between r  and s” really amounts to asking for the specifics of the r implementation  of the s language, i.e., the difference between the r and sengines.
when creating data frames using data.frame() or read.table(), r by default ensures that the variable names are syntactically valid.
and if you can accept  regression splines you can useglm().
* x although this behavior may initially seem to be rather strange, is  perfectly logical.
- “writing r extensions” (r-exts) currently describes the process of creating r add-on packages, writing r documentation, r's system and foreign language interfaces, and the rapi.

why does outer() behave strangely with my function?
- “an introduction to r” (r-intro) includes information on data types, programming elements, statistical modeling and graphics.
how do i convert factors to numeric?
of theopen source definition: the license must not restrict anyone from making use of the  program in a specific field of endeavor.
use the programps to find the process number of the currently running r process then use the attach command in gdb to attach it to that process.
simply add the line deb http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian stable/ (feel free to use a cran mirror instead of the master) to the file /etc/apt/sources.list, and install as usual.
- why are powers of negative numbers wrong?
- why are p-values not displayed when using lmer()?
see the help page for x11() for more information.
next:  what is cran?
please use thecran site closest to you to reduce network load.
next: why is r named r?, previous: what is cran?, up: r basics 2.11 can i use r for commercial purposes?
among these are: linear and generalized linear models, nonlinear regression models, time series analysis, classical parametric and nonparametric tests, clustering and smoothing.
it is recommended that you send mail to r-help rather than only to the r  core developers (who are also subscribed to the list, of course).
this book is often called the “blue book”, and  introduced what is now known as s version 2.
- lexical scoping - models - others 3.3.1 lexical scoping contrary to other implementations of the s language, r has adopted an evaluation model in which nested function definitions are lexically scoped.
if you want to debug the problem and find exactly what caused it, that is wonderful.
convenient access to information on these lists, subscription, and archives  is provided by the web interface athttp://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/.
you could also set the colortype of x11() to "pseudo.cube" rather than the default "pseudo".
if you have ghostscript you can  usebitmap(), which produces a postscript file then converts it to  any bitmap format supported by ghostscript.
the “intuitive” behavior could easily be implemented, but problems would arise whenever the expression is contained in a variable, passed as a parameter, or is the result of a function call.
next:  how can r be installed (macintosh), previous:  how  can r be installed (unix), up:  how can r be installed?
it  is usually a syntactic name as well, but can be any non-empty string if it is  quoted (and it is always quoted in the call toassign()).
you can use x[i]  d(expression(x^2), "x") 2
if binaries are available for your platform (see are there unix binaries for r?), you can use these, following the instructions that come with them.
from cran, you can obtain the latest official release of r, daily snapshots of r (copies of the current source trees), as gzipped and bzipped tar files, a wealth of additional contributed code, as well as prebuilt binaries for various operating systems (linux, mac os classic, mac os x, and ms windows).cran also provides access to documentation on r, existing mailing lists and the r bug tracking system.
a few packages are restricted to “non-commercial use”; you should contact the author to clarify whether these may be used or seek the advice of your legal counsel.
argument names are also usually syntactic names, but again can be anything if they are quoted.
you can also use make pdf  to build pdf (portable document format) version of the manuals, and view these  using e.g. acrobat.
the current version of r will configure and build under a number of common  unix platforms includingcpu-linux-gnu for the i386, alpha, arm, hppa, ia64,  m68k, mips/mipsel, powerpc, s390, sparc (e.g., http://buildd.debian.org/build.php?&pkg=r-base), and x86_64 cpus,  powerpc-apple-darwin, mips-sgi-irix,  rs6000-ibm-aix, and sparc-sun-solaris.
use the programps to find the process number of the currently  running r process then use theattach command in gdb to attach it  to that process.
a “live” linux distribution with a particular focus on r is quantian, which provides a directly bootable and self-configuring “live dvd” containing numerous applications of interests to scientists and researchers, including several hundredcran and bioconductor packages, the “ess” extensions for emacs, the “jgr” javagui for r, the ggobi visualization tool as well as several other r interfaces.
use the next: acknowledgments, previous: r programming, up: top trace() function with argument signature= to add calls to the browser or any other code to the method that will be dispatched for the corresponding signature.
one way to describe the scoping differences between r and s is to say that in s the enclosing environment isalways the global workspace, but in r the enclosing environment is wherever the function was created.
- why is the output not printed when i source() a file?
the r distribution also comes with the following manuals.
when you really need a \, you have to escape it with another\. thus, in filenames use something like next: how do i convert factors to numeric?, previous: how do file names work in windows?, up: r miscellanea "c:\\data\\money.dat" .
whereas the resulting language is very similar in appearance to s, the underlying implementation and semantics are derived from scheme.
s is a very high level language and an environment for data analysis and  graphics.
it is also explicitly stated in clause 0 of the gpl, which says in part activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.
it requires functions that are vectorized to work elementwise on arrays.
sources, binaries and documentation for r can be obtained via cran, the  “comprehensive r archive network” (seewhat is cran?).
in r, they are determined by the environment in which the function was created.
if r is already installed, it can be started by typing r at the shell  prompt (of course, provided that the executable is in your path).
it consists of letters, numbers, and the dot and (for version of r at least 1.9.0) underscore characters, and starts with either a letter or a dot not followed by a number.
sometimes bquote() gives a more compact form, e.g., title(bquote(hat(a) = .(ahat)))
your function  probably cannot handle two large vectors as parameters.
- what is the difference between package and library?
next: r and s, previous: introduction, up:
edu/users/statlabs/. last, but not least, ross' and robert's experience in designing and  implementing r is described in ihaka & gentleman (1996), “r: a  language for data analysis and graphics”,journal of computational and  graphical statistics, 5, 299–314.
more details on installing and  administering r on debian linux can be found at http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/debian/readme.

why did my .rprofile stop working when i updated r?
everything should be pretty standard.
always include the version of r, machine, and operating system that you are using; typeversion in r to print this.
there is also a large set of functions which provide a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data presentations.
