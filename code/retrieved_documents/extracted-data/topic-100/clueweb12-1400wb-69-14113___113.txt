you can compute your favorite sums of squares quite easily.

how can r be obtained?
if you define the general function wrapper <- function(x, y, my.fun, ...) { sapply(seq(along = x), fun =  function(i) my.fun(x[i], y[i], ...)) } then you can use outer() by writing, e.g., outer(1:4, 1:2, fun = wrapper, my.fun = foo, happy = 10) next:  how do i produce png graphics in batch mode?,  previous: why does outer() behave strangely with my function?, up:  r  miscellanea 7.18
you can find out the parent environment for an invocation of a function by using parent.frame() or sys.frame(sys.parent())
there is no need to be agitated about the particular sums of squares that r  reports.

one way to describe the scoping differences between r and s is  to say that in s the enclosing environment isalways the global  workspace, but in r the enclosing environment is wherever the function was  created.
that way.gdbinit can stay in the directory with the code and be used to set up the environment and the search paths for the source, e.g. as follows: set env r_home /opt/r set env r_papersize letter set env r_printcmd lpr dir /opt/r/src/appl dir /opt/r/src/main dir /opt/r/src/nmath dir /opt/r/src/unixnext: r programming, previous: r and emacs, up: top you can use x[i]  d(expression(x^2), "x") 2 * x although this behavior may initially seem to be rather strange, is perfectly logical.

the design of r has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:  becker, chambers & wilks' s (seewhat is s?) and sussman's scheme.
whereas  the resulting language is very similar in appearance to s, the underlying  implementation and semantics are derived from scheme.

sources are also available via https://svn.r-project.org/r/, the r  subversion repository, but currently not via anonymous rsync (nor cvs).
next:  what is s-plus?,
in s, the values of free  variables are determined by a set of global variables (similar to c, there is  only local and global scope).
it really has nothing much to do  with names in the language, but it is traditional to call these strings file  “names”.
so for most user-visible functions the enclosing environment will be the global workspace, since that is where most functions are defined.

in particular, binary packages for windows and mac os x  are provided by the respective binary package maintainers.
how can i sort the rows of a data frame?
often, it is desired to use the value of an r object in a plot label, e.g.,  a title.

to understand what names are “valid”, one needs to take into  account that the term “name” is used in several different (but  related) ways in the language: a syntactic name is a string the parser interprets as this type  of expression.
based on the s language,s-plus provides functionality in a wide variety of areas, including robust regression, modern non-parametric regression, time series, survival analysis, multivariate analysis, classical statistical tests, quality control, and graphics drivers.
manuals written in thegnu texinfo system can also be converted to info files suitable for reading online with emacs or stand-alonegnu info; usemake info to create these versions (note that this requires makeinfo version 4.5).
of course, in the case of bug reports it would be very helpful to have code which reliably reproduces the problem.
one advantage of this method is that you have separate*r* and *gud-gdb* windows.
that way.gdbinit can stay in the directory with the code and be used to set up  the environment and the search paths for the source, e.g. as follows: set env r_home /opt/r set env r_papersize letter set env r_printcmd lpr  dir /opt/r/src/appl dir /opt/r/src/main dir /opt/

the parent  environment will be wherever the function happens to be called from.
next:  why does the output from anova() depend on the order of  factors in the model?,
it consists of letters, numbers, and the dot and (for version of  r at least 1.9.0) underscore characters, and starts with either a letter or a  dot not followed by a number.
this difference becomes manifest when free variables occur in a function.
then start gud (m-x gdb) giving the r binary (using its full path name) as the program to debug.
the name is partly based on the (first) names of the first two r authors  (robert gentleman and ross ihaka), and partly a play on the name of the bell  labs language `s' (seewhat is s?).
it requires  functions that are vectorized to work elementwise on arrays.
the command 1+1 computes the value 2 and returns it; the command summary(glm(y~x+z, family=binomial))
the core of r is an interpreted computer language which allows branching  and looping as well as modular programming using functions.
there is also a large set of  functions which provide a flexible graphical environment for creating various  kinds of data presentations.
once downloaded, uncompressed and executed, the installer will install the current non-developer release of r. raqua is a native mac os x darwin version of r with an aqua gui.
you can copy the  script to a place where users can invoke it, for example to/usr/local/bin.
we can regard s as a language with three current implementations or  “engines”, the “old s engine” (s version 3;s-plus 3.x  and 4.x), the “new s engine” (s version 4;s-plus 5.x and above),  and r. given this understanding, asking for “the differences between r  and s” really amounts to asking for the specifics of the r implementation  of the s language, i.e., the difference between the r and sengines.

next:  what is cran?
please use thecran site closest to you to reduce network load.
it is recommended that you send mail to r-help rather than only to the r  core developers (who are also subscribed to the list, of course).
among these are: linear and generalized linear models, nonlinear regression models, time series analysis, classical parametric and nonparametric tests, clustering and smoothing.
this book is often called the “blue book”, and  introduced what is now known as s version 2.
if you want to debug the problem and find exactly what caused it, that is wonderful.
please read the posting guide before sending anything to any mailing list.
you could also set the colortype of x11() to "pseudo.cube" rather than the default "pseudo".
if you have ghostscript you can  usebitmap(), which produces a postscript file then converts it to  any bitmap format supported by ghostscript.
the “intuitive” behavior could easily be implemented, but problems would arise whenever the expression is contained in a variable, passed as a parameter, or is the result of a function call.

it  is usually a syntactic name as well, but can be any non-empty string if it is  quoted (and it is always quoted in the call toassign()).
you can use x[i]  d(expression(x^2), "x") 2
if binaries are available for your platform (see are there unix binaries for r?), you can use these, following the instructions that come with them.
next: how can r be obtained?, previous: what machines does r run on?, up: r basics
from cran, you can obtain the latest official release of r, daily snapshots of r (copies of the current source trees), as gzipped and bzipped tar files, a wealth of additional contributed code, as well as prebuilt binaries for various operating systems (linux, mac os classic, mac os x, and ms windows).cran also provides access to documentation on r, existing mailing lists and the r bug tracking system.
a few packages are restricted to “non-commercial use”; you should contact the author to clarify whether these may be used or seek the advice of your legal counsel.
argument names are also usually syntactic names, but again can be anything if they are quoted.
you can also use make pdf  to build pdf (portable document format) version of the manuals, and view these  using e.g. acrobat.
use the programps to find the process number of the currently  running r process then use theattach command in gdb to attach it  to that process.
one way to describe the scoping differences between r and s is to say that in s the enclosing environment isalways the global workspace, but in r the enclosing environment is wherever the function was created.
the r distribution also comes with the following manuals.
s is a very high level language and an environment for data analysis and  graphics.
whereas the resulting language is very similar in appearance to s, the underlying implementation and semantics are derived from scheme.
it is also explicitly stated in clause 0 of the gpl, which says in part activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.
it requires functions that are vectorized to work elementwise on arrays.
sources, binaries and documentation for r can be obtained via cran, the  “comprehensive r archive network” (seewhat is cran?).
in r, they are determined by the environment in which the function was created.

if r is already installed, it can be started by typing r at the shell  prompt (of course, provided that the executable is in your path).
you can also obtain the r faq from the doc/faq subdirectory of a cran site (seewhat is cran?).next: notation, previous: obtaining this document, up: introduction
previous: what are the enclosing and parent environments?, up: r miscellanea often, it is desired to use the value of an r object in a plot label, e.g., a title.

sometimes bquote() gives a more compact form, e.g., title(bquote(hat(a) = .(ahat)))
your function  probably cannot handle two large vectors as parameters.
