the scientific dataset library and tools project, developed jointly by microsoft research cambridge and moscow state university, is aimed at manipulation and visualization of multidimensional data sets.
it allows different datasets of different formats (netcdf, netcdf4 classic, hdf4, hdf4-eos, grib-1, and grib-2) to be imported into one uniform and consistent data manipulation environment, which internally is the netcdf data format.
we rely on developers to help keep this list up-to-date.
vicente galiano of miguel hernandez university has developed a python  interface to pnetcdf.
hops is not a monolithic program, but a suite of operators that act on data units called "hyperslabs".
