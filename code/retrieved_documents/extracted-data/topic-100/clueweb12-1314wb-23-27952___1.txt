we don’t have to write latex documents from scratch, and everything is intuitive in lyx. you can clearly see the structure of your document, as well as figures (instead of \includegraphics{}), tables (instead of the gory \begin{table} numbers 1.4 & 2.2 & 3.8), headings (instead of \title{} \section{}) and math formulae (instead of $\frac{\gamma}{\alpha_{ij}}$)…
pgfsweave will try to format your r code by default, e.g. add  spaces and indent where appropriate when your source code is not  well-formatted.
for example, i hate typing \item in an itemize environment each time i need a new item.

this is good because we don’t need  to worry about the version numbers.
in the  past, i did not like writing latex documents just because i hate wasting my  time on typing the raw commands.
in pgfsweave, we just set the width and height naturally in the code chunk options like >=.
in all, it is a whole lot easier  and faster to write latex documents in lyx. this is the main reason for an  easier life of sweave, because a sweave document is nothing but a mixture of  latex and r code.
a brilliant one is the pgfsweave package.
although sweave in lyx is convenient to use, it is not a trivial task for  beginners to configure and understand how it works.

it was built upon the cachesweave package to support caching r objects (to avoid unnecessary repeated computations and save time), and it also provided a mechanism to cache graphics!
i did not add r’s texmf directory to the root directory of miktex;  instead i copied all the files to the user directory of miktex (this can be a  bad practice too)
for example, you may ask “what’s a texmf tree?”

a sweave document is dynamic in the sense that everything in the  document can be changed by the r code (nothing is hard-coded), so we  don’t need to worry too much about the specific numbers and plots in the  output.

the video below can give you an idea on what it looks like in lyx (chinese visitors please go to photobucket or 56.com to watch the video): as we can see, r code can be easily embedded into lyx. if you are familiar with sweave, you don’t even need time to learn anything.

by the way, i also like the nogin option for sweave.sty to be  the default in pgfsweave, because i really don’t like the idea of setting  the size of graphics by a latex macro\setkeys{gin}{width=0.8\textwidth} .
this packages uses the tikzdevice package to produce pgf/tikz graphics which are essentially latex code, in other words, the r graphics are represented in the latex language so that they are treated (compiled) in the same way as the body of a latex document.

configuration to make lyx work with sweave, we need to take these steps: put the latex style files such as sweave.sty under the texmf tree define the literate programming environment in lyx (literate-scrap.inc)  and corresponding layouts (the critical step) create converters to convert sweave documents to latex  (this is done in the preferences file) and the converter is like r -e  "library(pgfsweave);pgfsweave($$i,compile.tex=false)" where$$i is a variable in lyx denoting the input file each step involves with several novel concepts for beginners.
while sweave is a great invention for reproducible research, there are  other packages which can improve r’s default sweave functionality.
