this may save them precious time they can use for constantly improving r, and will typically also result in much quicker feedback for yourself.enclosing environments are important because a function can use variables in the enclosing environment to share information with other functions or with other invocations of itself (see the section on lexical scoping).most of the user-visible functions in r are written in r. it is possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the c, c++, or fortran languages for efficiency.the core of r is an interpreted computer language which allows branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.as an example of how r can be used in teaching an advanced introductory statistics course, see d. nolan and t. speed (2000), “stat labs: mathematical statistics through applications”, springer texts in statistics, isbn 0-387-98974-9 this integrates theory of statistics with the practice of statistics through a collection of case studies (“labs”), and uses r to analyze the data.based on the s language,s-plus provides functionality in a wide variety of areas, including robust regression, modern non-parametric regression, time series, survival analysis, multivariate analysis, classical statistical tests, quality control, and graphics drivers.there is also a large set of functions which provide a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data presentations.in particular, it implements backfitting with both local regression and smoothing splines, and is extendable.the act of running the program is not restricted, and the output from the program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the program.this ensures that the site profile and saved data files are not read.when creating data frames using data.frame() or read.table(), r by default ensures that the variable names are syntactically valid.it consists of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script files.of course, in the case of bug reports it would be very helpful to have code which reliably reproduces the problem.3.3.1 lexical scoping contrary to other implementations of the s language, r has adopted an evaluation model in which nested function definitions are lexically scoped.s is an elegant, widely accepted, and enduring software system, with conceptual integrity, thanks to the insight, taste, and effort of john chambers.
