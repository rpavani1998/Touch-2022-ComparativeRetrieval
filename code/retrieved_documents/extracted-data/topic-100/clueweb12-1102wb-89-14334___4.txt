that's why i like perl, it supports a variety of styles of thinking.
what are you using these days to solve problems similar to the original one?
nowadays though, the programmer's time should be worth more than the computer's, so rapid development time and maintainability are key.
only few people can play with 'pyrex' perl - 2, python -1 3) mod-perl better than mod-python
i do this for them as i want them to get on and "develop" (using more traditional langs).
i learned the basics quite quickly and soon i could write useful scripts to make my life easier.
no matter how much better you *think* you can do it.
nevertheless i was aware of all the hullabaloo about python and ruby and i thought i may need to upgrade.
in this thread different level of developers shared their views.
the first time i encountered that, i pretty much figured that perl was a poorly designed language hack, even if it did make some things "easy to do".
kerry kartchner i find it interesting that, particularly with the python and ruby solutions, nobody chose to use classes.
well, after having gone through all the chapters and done many of the exercises, i realized that... perl and my brain go in different directions.

a couple of months ago i had to design a program to assemble a custom-made catalogue with hundred of photos on the fly for our clients, in the format of a pdf file.
the most important thing, by far, for me is maintainability.

at this point i defer to tom c's brilliant comment: "the language usually doesn't make anywhere near as much of a difference as the programmer's skill does.
its possible to write unreadable code in any language.

"1"}  contactrecords.each {|r| print r.join("\t"), "\n" } this is actually the shortest version, and i think it’s the easiest  to read if you aren’t put off by the block syntax.
as a result, i will go with perl (i dabbled in it a long time ago) and will play with the others for fun.zen sand gardens
we have thousands of perl scripts in our projects, and really like to maintain it!
so, to me, the first way of doing it is more maintainable.
into: for record in (line.split('\t') for line in sys.stdin): would change the full list comprehension into a generator, meaning it will only read the next line when the loop iterates.

larry and company have gone through great pains -- years of polishing and fine tuning -- to get perl to have that well-worn comfortable feel.
recently a friend asked me if i could help him write a script for manipulating a dataset in text-file for his research project.
these languages ( python, ruby, perl ) have remained to a small amount of experienced programmers.
the reason why i think none of these excellent programming languages have become the mainstream and will never do at least for another 10 yrs.
we are quite big project (well, more than 100 requests per second).
too many @ signs, etc.
the whole thing could probably be done with one s///ge in perl, but that wasn't what i was going for.
it provides an strict syntax that allows the compiler to remove thousands of trivial errors, and allow the novice programmers to have a more readable high level version than something written in c++, plus the portability.
i had to look up howjoin and filter worked, because they weren’t methods of list as i had guessed.
but many times, we have non-perl programmers looking at the code (we use many languages, from java, visual basic, asp, c adn perl) and many systems interact here, each part written by different companies with different language choices.
regex is not part of the core language, but is part of the python standard library -- but having it be a standard library means that the core language is not intimately regex-ified (this may be a plus or a minus, depending on the programmer and

guido did an excellent job of making code look like pseudo code.
like many others, i had to face the biblical dilemma perl vs python (i hardly knew about the existence of ruby at that time).
once you've done, you will never want to come back to dumb wrappers like .removeallwhitespaces().
you can write ugly code in any language.
i have been in management a long time but love programming.
anyway, one must be confortable with the tools one choose.
pm list comprehensions are by now very idomatic in python.
the same for reference/dereference.)
am many thanks to all who haver so far participated in this lengthy, but friendly and thoughtful thread.
in my case -- and it's been 18 years since i wrote my first perl program -- perl has time and again proven its value in the must diverse and unsuspect circumstances.
people that write one liners will have their name cursed...those of you who write poorly documented code won't fare much better either.
also it's emphasis on "only one way to do something" (the pythonic way).
please refer to the comment made by anonymous on january 27, 2009 12:31 am to see the simplicity of awk.
#!/usr/bin/perl use constant {sku_title => 1, contact_me => 2}; use strict; use warnings; use text::csv; my $file = $argv[0] or die "usage: $0 "; open(my $fh, 'new({sep_char => "\t"}); $csv->column_names($csv->getline($fh));
use what you learned from the other languages to better design something in the one.
foreach grep { $_->[1] eq "1" } sort { $a->[0] cmp $b->[0] } map { [ @$_[17,27,34] ] } grep { s/"//g for @$_ } map { [ split /\t/ ] } ; intermediate variables it's a rubbish!
who can draw a conclusion then?james september 15, 2007 12:12 pm
perl finishes the race and python is not even out of its tracks.
japh got the closest when he talked about writing in python so that the people that would inherit the code would understand it, but ultimately, we have to face the fact that we are generally not going to own the code once it is handed off to the real owners, those that told us to write it in the first place.
python is practical like recipe.
contactrecords, that contains arrays of just the fields we care about: skutitle, contactme, email.
i'm a biologist who sometimes has to analyze large datasets so a few months ago i convinced myself to learn a scripting language.
but as there is a huge base of young people learning to do things, something as strict as java is needed.
i simply like expressive, clean languages.
here's one of the possible (simplified) ways i would do it: it should comply with your requirements as described above.
it was painful but very enlightening to refactor and now i have an extensible (extendable) library that i can use for my research that should carry me through my thesis and quite possibly beyond.
zack april 5, 2008 4:21 pm
anyway, end of commentmark aufflick
i have read eric raymond's discussion on why he prefers python.
but i agree that it’s a good idea to use the idioms of the language you are writing in, so i think the solution is for me to learn a language that has a more appealing style.
guo september 11, 2007 9:30 pm
also note that i moved your filter (implemented using reject!
is this 200+ line mental limit on perl scripts a feature or a bug?
i agree with that - maintaining a sense of context becomes mind-bending.
this task, which required 2 full time employees to assemble the catalogue every fortnight, is now done by the program and through the internet, sparing my employees who can now perform more productive work.
"1", contactrecords) for r in contactrecords: print "\t".join(r)
it's like going from learning italian, then spanish, then portuguese, and then arabic.
another point of view in choosing languages and environments is that "it's all about the api".
i mean even lowly basic didn't need that kludge.
# default sort  will group by sku title contactrecords.reject!
i replaced your regexp replacement with a plain string extract, which supports double quotes inside values, and is faster.
i know well, i have to learn a fresh.
ruby is a pure o-o language that should appeal to perl programmers.
ruby is quite something and i expect people will start using ruby for scripting.
i own a website that has around 200 thousand unique visitors a day, and that was done in php (though i only sat down to write the core engine of the site, which is very math and db intensive; i have rewritten some of it in python recently).
if you think that, then you aren't using modules and other object oriented techniques.
has some share of either of three.
i guess i'd rather write my own library/extension in/for ruby (which one has to do less frequently these days) than use an existing solution in python or perl.
thus, the style is perhaps not canonical  python or perl, although since i’m new to ruby it’s probably not  canonical ruby either.
there's also the environment ; if you have a huge ide with tons of automated tasks and refactorings, it won't be a hurdle to clean your code, so your code will be cleaner.
sh sed -e 1d -e 's/"//g' | awk 'begin { fs="\t" } $28 ==
legibility fans may find python's emphasis on fun and legibility to be a major plus.
there is no question about it.

perl6 is a quantum-leap toward a full-featured dynamic programming platform.
:->conficker i don't understand how people can like ruby.
[] while gets record = $_.split('\t').collect!
the only thing i hate about perl5 is the lack of a nicer oop syntax.
i read all the contributions with interest and i conclude that although python and ruby are nice languages and they indeed force you to write readable and maintainable code, perl has nothing to be envious of them.
dr bullshit january 11, 2008 1:10 pm i started programming with c++ and adopted its efficiency and terseness philosophy.
my experience with writing code has always been very project specific.
i'm not fond of the ugly perl syntax myself.
perhaps in that sense python scores better.
the way to improve your programming is not by learning the intracacies of a particular language, but by learning many different paradigms.

thats one of the things that i am really impressed with with python.
i find that perl/ruby are more of the old paradigm.
after a few hundred lines the ability to quickly surmise what's going on becomes suddenly more challenging.
remove the elements of contactrecords where contactme is not  1.
foreach my $line ( <> ) ouch!
the if $rec[contactme] in the while loop goes against that, but could easily be moved into the for loop.
it's strength and flexibility makes it perfect for fast development/prototyping.
there are a number of open source rexx's available including several object-oriented rexx's.
perl is a powerful language, but i think it’s ugly and encourages writing bad code, so i want to get rid of it.
david i've done quite a lot of perl, enough ruby and python.
although it is interesting somewhat, it only matters in the very beginning.

i found all versions of all programs above very readable (perhaps i'm gifted?
here’s the basic algorithm: record.
i had to look up how join and filter worked, because they weren’t methods of list as i had guessed.
it's a personal thing i suppose.
perl is faster than python even using pyscho doesn't help(offers a max of 4x speed than the original version).

while java also has lots of standard libraries, java tends to be a lower level language (more lines of code to look through), and many of the libraries appear to be written to fulfill some spec rather than to accomplish common tasks more easily (whereas cpan modules tend to be written to be used by mere mortals).rtfa.net »
but it is currently the best contender.
gavin's comment, "perhaps your time would be better spent becoming a better perl programmer than to learn a new language?" was the watershed moment.
i assumed the comment-taker was smart enough to html-ificate the text.
still under java of course.

in conclusion, i will carry on with perl.
though being primarily a basic/c programmer myself, i think i'm going to like python/c and feel at home.

do you believe that compile time vs. runtime error check makes a difference with the novice programmers, that is with the 80% of the programmers out there.
rexx continues to be distributed with ibm systems and there has been an ansi standard for rexx since 1996.
how is this trend changing (python gaining/loosing popularity over perl)?
why not go all the way and make it a one-liner? :-)

i think the syntax also makes the program (at this point i no longer consider it a script) "look" like a garbled mess even though it's still as clear as its smaller cousins.
leave that to the java peeps since they can't get enough widgetwhichproducesbsfactory.
1 { printf "%s\t%s\n", $35, $18 }' | sort $ doit.sh ooops.
if you have developers/maintainers who can't grasp the language, you've got much bigger problems waiting for you.
just to be sure everybody is clear: perl can do serious computational stuff, at the computational level of c/fortran.
no one language is best at everything, even on a web application, so my conclusion is to learn them all and utilize them in their areas of strengths: perl for text manipulation, shell scripting for simple operations, ruby (most likely) for database integration.
esellerate gives me a  tab-delimited file containing information about the people who boughtmy  shareware.

bkb do you think you could put the example text back up?
so there's no readability problem in our project.
i do think the crosstalk between the languages is a good thing and appreciate all the great code that comes out of each camp.
even if you are concerned by readability, perl is very customizable.
i decided to solve this problem in each language and then compare the  resulting programs.
obviously it depends on what you're trying to do, but for me, it has turned out to be a great feature.
readability, english-ness etc.
it's something i probably wouldn't use in production but it's a fairly decent example.
quite frankly, i'm not exactly sure where python would fit on the web as there aren't that many tasks that it seems overwhelmingly suited for, but perhaps that's because i don't know it well enough.
on the other hand, it doesn't take any additional effort to write code that can be future proofed against data that would otherwise break.
the good languages each have a problem domain (or several) that they are best suited for.
#!/usr/bin/perl use strict; use sort::fields; # you can use these as comments #my $email = 17; #my $contactme = 27; #my $skutitle = 34; my @selectedrecords; while () { my @array = split (/\t/); next if $array[27] ne "\"1\""; push (@selectedrecords,"$array[17]\t$array[27]\t$array[34]"); } print map { "$_\n" } fieldsort '\t' , [3], @selectedrecords; alpha monk i realize this as a 7 year old weblog(blog) post, but i wonder what michael tsai is using as a programming language, when dealing with text now.

finally, you can't ship compiled code with ruby, but with python you can.

here’s a toy problem i wanted to solve.
over the past few weeks i read thepython tutorial and the non-reference parts of programming ruby, however as of this afternoon i’d not written any python or ruby code yet.
early optimization (in other words, optimizing before you know the scope of the problem) is a telltale giveaway of a programmer who thinks he knows more than he does.
nb: i'm not bragging; i've written code that falls into both the former and the latter categories.
readable and logical to the way we commonly think.

i also suppose you really want "\t" rather than "\t", as in the latter case it wouldn't work at all (wrt your description).
also, i can iterate that we can write clean code with perl also.

print contactrecords to standard output, with the fields  separated by tabs and the records separated by newlines.
zack april 5, 2008 4:25 pm oh, and one more thing: i had was completly ignorant as to the fact that you could just type "python" or "ruby" or whatever kindof oldskool stuff that that unix guy conjured up, into like 99% of major linux distrobutions.
print contactrecords to standard output, with the fields separated by tabs and the records separated by newlines.
it may not be actually a problem to do so, but it is generally recommended not to do this, as it will slurp all of your file at once, which is not needed.
sys.stdin.readlines()[1:] # the slice gets rid of the field names.
i'd like to finish with a couple of questions.
i have never found a language so powerful, and so "suited' to unix.
i know your input data was very specific.
if you want it to decide according to context whether "4.5" is a string or a number, you have to provide a context.
i even think it is possible to convert perl to any language without even changing to other interpreter :)
i like and use all three, altough i am currently more proficient in python...n3xtl3v3l february 22, 2007 5:30 pm
'which language can teach me more' is at least as important as 'which language fits my brain'.
it takes what other languages accomplish, does it faster, with less code, and makes it fun to write.
at the risk of lots of flames, i consider perl to be one of these, ditto for php.
and the pass by reference...
i coded it first in ruby, and then ported the code to python and perl,  changing it as little as possible.
as i only have a livecd distro to work with atm, i was shocked really, when i opened my terminal, and to my utter surprise, when i type "python", sure enough, the interactive python interpreter comes up.
so, looking at code and understanding it clearly without comments is only good for you, and not another programmer that comes along.
and this idiom is used throughout perl.
i'd like to dwell on that for a moment.
i have toyed with ruby and python, and both, while "ok", just didn't do it for me.
i like python better than ruby better than perl.
one thing that python has and gcc doesn't is, have you ever seen a current, stable gcc windows xp x64 binary?
even though i only knew it for days, it feels, weirdly comforting and nice (ref.
i did a similar comparison between c vs perl and perl vs python - with the intent of comparing opengl performance.
that looks like such a "lazy compiler/interpreter writer" thing that one has to ask wtf?
say we have to modify /etc/inittab and change it to init 3.
test your variables please, it will make all of us very happy!
python has more available for it than ruby at this time, and having a library to do what you want can make a big difference.
in general i find that blindly following the hold-on-to-the-language-you-know approach tends to correlate with poor programming skills.qor february 10, 2008 3:23 am argf.each { |line| p line.split("\t").values_at(17, 27, 34) if line.gsub!
ruby, from what it sounds, looks pretty good as well.
you can, of course, incur an expensive fork process, but then passing values between the seperate processes becomes expensive.
also, bear in mind that split really wants a regex as aq first argument, with one major -useful- exception.
'1' and (row[0], row[2]) or '\r', i know this is outside the scope of your examples, but possibly informative...
my @records = (); incidentally, my @records; is just as fine.
it could have been anything, of course it just have to be meaningful in the context..
granted, sometimes that is ourselves, but in those cases, like so many of us have pointed out, we'll just do things our own way and cleanliness and commenting go out the window, fast. :-)
once you are expert at any one of them, there would probably be little reason to ever switch to another.
do i comment on discussions/blogs/forums etc.

i've seen beautiful, clean, maintainable, performant perl code, and horrible, ugly, slow python/ruby code."
does anyone have an idea of the number of perl vs python users, roughly?
but really, i would count bbum's solution as pretty normal looking python.
i'll have to say that comentador's comment about nightmares from programming perl really cracked me up once i saw what he was talking about.
i like that with mine it is more clear which field we are sorting and filtering on.
so i took it up to learn a new language even though i would be perfectly comfortable writing it in php or perl (or c/c++, for that matter).
it also goes to point out that i agree (with whoever now ;-), that knowing multiple languages is invaluable.
the thing i like about perl over ruby is the fact that perl's functions are very versatile.

although i can program in many languages i am hooked on perl.
the language usually doesn't make anywhere near as much of a difference as the programmer's skill does.
roman march 30, 2011 4:35 am i'm only few month programer in perl, but... not better write perl like this ?
over the past few weeks i  read thepython tutorial and the non-reference parts of programming ruby,  however as of this afternoon i’d not written any python or ruby code yet.
i’ve been using perl for several years and am very comfortable with it, although i’m definitely not an expert.
and by and large i have succeeded at it.
i don't know about you, but i'd rather juggle two sets of operators than have to convert my numberish strings to numbers explicitly.
but if the aim here is to accomplish a goal and speed is not a crucial factor, then the following perl code would be a better solution, as it is more self-documenting.
and when they do, i will probably be back to python.
my @recs = sort { $a->[0] cmp $b->[0] } grep { $_->[1] eq '1' } map { my @r = split /\t/; [map { s/"//g; $_ } @r[34, 27, 17]] } <>; print join("\t", @$_), "\n" for @recs;michael gavin: i definitely should have used the array slice idiom rather than writing out [$$r[$skutitle], $$r[$contactme], $$r[$email]].
this is not uncommon.
if you put one statement in incorrect place, ofcourse wehave to debug.
for a similar reason something like cpan is a great factor in maintainability.
we can tweak apache better with perl perl - 3, python -1 4) dbi:x (no such facility in python) perl -4,
you also copy the whole list with the second list comprehension, which can be transformed into a for loop after the in-place sort.
the immediacy of the language really charmed me as i could now write programs that made sense to me very quickly and with little effort.
p.s. sorry for my englishthoran hi, thanks for the comparison.
and here’s the code: perl #!/usr/bin/perl -w use strict; my @records = (); foreach my $line (  <> ) { my @record = map {s/"//g; $_} split("\t", $line);  push(@records, \@record); } my $email = 17; my $contactme = 27; my $skutitle =
brad cathey november 19, 2007 9:50
both perl5 and ruby are reasonably terse, and can have both good function-point density and comment density in a page of code.
as such, i have had a chance do program in a number of languages, both systemic and dynamic, such as lisp, c, c++, fortran, pascal, perl, python, ruby, .net, visual basic, sed, awk, tcl/tk, etc.
in this case, perl's cpan with mature building blocks such as poe and mod_perl wins me over every time.
btw, excelent discussion you have here :)sandy december 31, 2008 10:57 pm hello friends, i am looking for perl indepth good tutorial.
i was trawling through the web for python, ruby, perl comparisons when i saw your excellent discussion.
i've been a spamsieve user for many years (and love it).michael brian: certainly, it can only help python's popularity, however i was under the impression that python was already more widely used than ruby.
but arguments could be made for either, and really not a good reasons for choosing either.
- i had the same problem (as i also came from perl to ruby and couldn't figure this one out right away).
yes, specially because of the sigils thing.
as i said, i'm not a full time programmer so for me an intuitive and english-like style is a big plus since i might not touch a script for months.
i was also looking for a comparison of the three languages, but after seeing gavin's excellent post from december 1 at 7:17 pm, i don't really need to see more.
perl, python, and ruby all have their strengths.
/usr/bin/perl print join("\t", @$_), "\n" for sort { $a->[0] cmp $b->[0]
if you chose to ignore the things which make perl (or again, any language) readable, easy to understand, easy to maintain, etc. then of course you can make things unpleasant.
by the way, you might think that my collection of modules should have the same 200-line mental limitations, but i find that i can work with a module with many thousands of lines of code and it doesn't bother me.
many times now i have revisited my old code, only to find that i hadn't documented it.
good programmers produce good code.
it is another nightmare.

i'd been writing perl for many years, but i found i could accomplish the same tasks in much cleaner ways with far fewer mistakes coding in ruby.

perl really is the swiss army knife from hell.
i decided to give it a go with perl for two good reasons 1) perl is the english of bioinformatics 2)

i found perl often to be counterintuitive (the concept of default variable appeared to me mysterious, unnecessary and that $_ look didn't help.
marktroy may 21, 2007 10:09 pm this requirement is most efficiently done in standard bourne shell... % cat x "skutitle" "contactme" "email" "product1" "0" "foo@bar.com" "product2"
for your example, creating a class is needless overhead unless this is embedded in a larger context.
with comments, it is just mix of english everywhere and just imagine you write a comment in near line syntax and missed the "#" or "//" whatever.
but the bottom line is that when presented with a new problem, if the platform i work with poses no constraints in terms of the language i can use, i will normally choose perl.
ruby's author took the best of perl and the best of python to create ruby (other developer's idea of "best" may vary).
python and ruby both come with mac os x 10.2, both havebbedit language modules, and both promise a cleaner approach to scripting.

good programmers are rarely flashy.
this is a really useful post.
the website indeed has a list of how many perl jobs, php jobs, ruby jobs and python jobs are available.
i blogged about this same topic... to me ruby comes out way ahead almost all cases...
further, having $, @, % helps me to know the datatype at any point in the program than just a name as used in python, java, c++ etc.
if the modules are equivalent then python is preferred because its programming style helps the programmer avoid much documentation.
what we really like in perl is very huge cpan archive.
if customer.contactme: customers.append( customer) customers.sort( lambda x,y: cmp(x.skutitle, y.skutitle) ) for customer in customers: print customermichael
:-) the whole argument that one can write easy-to-read perl code is, to me, kind of vacuous.
perl is an abomination.

i was expecting ruby code to be more easy to read, but definitely python looks easier in this comparison.
sorry, but it looks like that file’s been missing for a long time, and i don’t have an archive handy.
did you program spamsieve in python?
i keep forgetting about the string composition using keywords.
i have been recently learning and scripting in ruby, and i could not be happier, an excellent language that has been eating up and converting some of the oldest perl programmers.
it is more wasteful of space and slightly slower than a some of the above examples, but unless you have a whole lot of records, that shouldn't matter.

i like this last version a lot, though a lot of the cleanness comes from using $_ and avoiding temporary variables.
i like that *much* better.

if you write bad ugly code you've got nobody to blame but yourself.
stop on by and check it out!
i think the python version is generally the cleanest to read—that is, it’s the most english-like.
with proper commenting, all 3 language examples would be ideal.
with perl, i forgot what i was doing even after coffee break.
also in my previous post i forgot to mention list comprehensions for python as a really cool thing and -> came out => (which is also used in ruby) but for building hashes.
use constant email => 17; use constant contactme => 27; use constant skutitle => 34; my @recs = (); while (<>) { s/"//g; my @rec = split /\t/; push @recs, [@rec[skutitle, contactme, email]] if $rec[contactme]; } for (sort { $a->[0] cmp $b->[0] } @recs) { print join("\t", @$_), "\n" }michael fair enough.
my example used a two-phase approach, imagining that it would be part of a larger system.

you simply cannot survive without the regular expression (imho, the real swiss army knife) at your back, when you are thrown into the tremendous biological text data desert.
it seems very common sense to somebody coming from another language.
all three languages have had 9 years of additional development and maturity.
things are looking great right now.
so, the solution is regardless the language, do comment when is (even barely) worth it.vlad december 31, 2008 5:24 pm btw, the comment "#--- contactrecords is an...." is just an example...
while ruby has a number of nice features, its lack of list comprehensions always frustrates me a bit.
i think that readable code is useful in a development team that has different programming skills.
i don't claim to write beautiful code, and honestly i suspect i don't.
i might add that perl seems to have the most support here and offers up a variety of ways to solve the initial problem.
i do all sorts of numerical stuff with pdl as grad student in physics, doing (single-core) simulations at the moment.
before i came to it, i was an experienced, long-time perl programmer with major doubts about my chosen language.
ruby and python are far more similar than they are different.

i am a perl guy and just wanted to add my notes and clarify a few points, especially about the 200-line 'mental limit' for perl scripts.
when there is a better horse, i'll switch my bet.
store the fields in an array called record.

i've had to use python (matplotlib and pymol scripting in particular) for some projects since then; it is a great language with fantastic libraries.
i do a lot of perl maintenance programming and my run perl tidy on some programs to clean them up a bit, but perl continues to be a beautiful girl to me.
and so my career path took a different turn (config mngmt).
the power of python and perl is not put into proper use when you don't do stuff that are the strengths of those languages.
so while this is an interesting read (esp.
jon ------------------------------- "the difference between theory and reality is that in theory, there is no difference, but in reality, there is.
the likelihood of that mostly rests on education of future programmers (right now we're churning out idiots)...
you didn't have to worry about embedded delimiters, records spanning multiple lines, and escaped quotes.
i've learned a lot today, so my conclusion, as far as perl is concerned, is this one print: #!
but it doesn't have a recognizable syntax.
so, not only learn these, but lisps, haskell, tcl, etc.. and yes, regex.
is really cheap, and short.
good code is rarely impressive; rather, it's clean and functional.
first time i am planning to use one scripting language for the common administrative purpose.
you can write easily readable and maintainable perl code, but it's something the language tries hard to prevent you from doing in it's simplest form, as you have demonstrated.
often projects become a simple stitching together cpan modules.
and here’s the code: #!/usr/bin/perl -w use strict; my @records = (); foreach my $line ( <> ) { my @record = map {s/"//g; $_} split("\t", $line); push(@records, \@record); } my $email = 17; my $contactme = 27; my $skutitle = 34; my @contactrecords = (); foreach my $r ( @records ) { push(@contactrecords, [$$r[$skutitle], $$r[$contactme], $$r[$email]]); } @contactrecords = sort {$$a[0] cmp $$b[0]} @contactrecords; @contactrecords = grep($$_[1] eq "1", @contactrecords); foreach my $r ( @contactrecords ) { print join("\t", @$r), "\n"; } the punctuation and my’s make this harder to read than it should be.
i decided to redo the ruby version since that is my language of choice, and have made this much shorter (slightly more than 50% fewer loc) and quite a bit more efficient (by rejecting unwanted records as they are read, rather than going through all records again later and also by not sorting before rejecting), and made a small change to the output---which was to remove the contactme field, since i would expect that it would not be required any further.
the solution is simple: use english; seriously.
michael tsai - blog - perl vs. python vs. ruby … in perl, i might have tried to avoid perl

but then again, perl's syntax doesn't bother me at all, and i can usually read right through (its kind of like a warm blanket ;-).
we can write maintainable code in perl too.
on the other hand, your example is both idiomatic and ugly (to me).
there are many tutorials about specific sub-topics in perl, but maybe you better try http://perldoc.perl.org/perlintro.html first.
imho python is the least readable language of the three for maintenance as it's more verbose.
those that only bother with one are destined to be the guy that gets laid off when the company moves on without them.
any code is going to be difficult for another programmer to know exactly what the previous programmer wrote and why.
this thread make me more confused about selecting a correct scripting language.
perl is way too cryptic for my purposes.
you send input to a, it sends its output to b, which sends to c, and you only store the end result, not the intermediate results.
so it is not problem with language "perl".
the microsoft world is a nightmare.
p.s. python sounds like a 70's joke and ruby sounds jewish.
for me, ruby, despite her few warts, flows in a way that i haven't been able to duplicate in python.
i happen to love perl.
i came here looking for a good discussion on what language was the best to use in a given situation and found a very well developed discussion on programming in general, which is good.
and maybe using more maps or statement modifiers would make the code more perlish and closer to the other examples.
perhaps somethings such as strings should (optionally?) not be an object.
looking at other folks code (ahem, java developers listen up), i find the lack of try...catch... disturbing, and the constant drone in logs about java.nullpointer...blah...
jon december 11, 2009 3:11 pm john said that rexx is no longer relevant.

i don't know for the rest, but re perl: #!
as to learning perl better, i dislike looking at perl code, especially when it’s written by perl experts and is highly idiomatic.
however, given a small computing task that needs to be done *right now* with little fuss i'll probably always do it in perl and probably will be doing until my fingers can no longer type.

perl is a powerful language, but i think  it’s ugly and encourages writing bad code, so i want to get rid of it.
why have 50 almost-the-same regexp functions, then another 50 for case insensitive operations?
having to see a lot of code from others programmers, having them forced to indent correctly seems like a nice feature.
so once i get a bit better at python, i'll post my solution and see how it fares against these others (there hasn't been a new example in a few years).
i've been writing perl scripts for well, at very least 5 or 6 years, and i still cannot skim through one of my colleague's scripts and know exactly what it does instantly.
now with parrot, no language can compete with perl!
those features (map/l.c, sort, grep/filter) can be grasped fully by 12 year olds (i've taught them).
whereas the second requires you to check what the removeallwhitespaces method is actually doing, and if it isn't doing it, then you have the problem of figuring out whether that behaviour is correct or not (better hope the comments/docs are good ;) ).
it almost always takes much longer to roll your own than it does to learn a new system.
in the comments of those who spoke for perl i detect something like a certain infatuation with the language and i can relate to this.
programming is complex why would i use a language thats hard to read and understand.
people familiar with unix know how pipelines work, and the same idea works here.
as for scalability of perl scripts, i have heard that perl programs get quite difficult to maintain after they get much larger than about 100 lines.
if not for the aforementioned english, and perl critic and, especially, moose ... that made perl more like python ...

i still don't know which language is better to become more familiar with.
(17, 27, 34); i'm not commenting the rest of your code because it seems more awkward perl code.
languages (all modern ones) will get more (lower-order) functional in nature, not less.
every other aspect of readability boils down to two things - 1) do you know the language, and 2) does your code follow the project/company standards previously established.
this appearance may be what makes some developers shy away from learning perl (some of my developers i still consider lazy mind).
i was a mainframe alc/cobol programmer for years before venturing into java/c++ a little then was "promoted" (lol) to management.

anyway i found python to be a good choice also.
i took the liberty to state the jobs greatest to smallest for folks who may not check this out for themselves.
in my first job i had to program monte carlo simulations and markov-chain algorithms in c, which after compilation was send to mini computers that required a couple of hours to come back with the results.
but if you write "noisy" code, then comment... dammit
remembering someone mentioning perl being very well suited for such purposes (ie bioinformatics) i went online for a quick tutorial and very quickly came up with the script which did the job and had fun doing it =)
thus, the style is perhaps not canonical python or perl, although since i’m new to ruby it’s probably not canonical ruby either.
interpreted languages are definitely better in that they done require a re-compile if you switch operating systems.
i wouldn't touch python with a long pole if i had to, i'm now completely addicted to the perl way of things and beyond hope.
seriously, it's unfair to compare bad perl code that doesn't use common idioms.
but get real - almost nobody does.
while python allows you to do a job, perl allows you to do it "and" dream.
cpan (one of the real clinchers) 6.
i realised early on in my career that i was no programmer (with fortran, pascal, c).
and had it not been for the success of python and its influence to fix the ugliness of perl code.
if anything, the fact that i never get to code in any single language for long enought certainly doesn't help in mastering the idiomatic strenghts of any of the languages i used.
since the perl community acknowledged and started devising problems for this short-coming, i was more comfortable returning to perl.
i agree with several other posters though, in that good, readable code is "documented code".
i have never programmed a single line in my entire life, but i read this post and its comments with great pleasure.
i think the real key is to find a language that fits in with how you think, whether that's perl or not isn't an issue for me, i just wanted the comparison to be a fair one.

i was interested in your comparison
as such the best language to use is one that's most likely to be known by the maintainer.

[[r[i] for i in sku, contact, email] for r in records if r[contact]=="1"] contacts.sort() for r in contacts: print "\t".join(r) print '\t'.join(sorted(contacts)) will save you two more lines but will it make the code better??
i won't repeat all the reasons here but you can read my post if you like athttp://www.strangeblueplanet.com/2008/10/perl-python-ruby.htmlmichael tsai sbp editor: it sounds like you have some misconceptions about how python works.stevebsd i'm trying to create this blog on programming in different languages.
i will point out that all of the above code examples are flawed in that if you want clear, readable code, you need to add many comments.
also, the absence of language-religious fanatics or dumb/flames is a rare find nowadays in the year 2009.
the perl community has come a long way.
i'm not saying there is anything wrong with compiled code, but in many cases, especially with the rise of web applications, this holds true.

lambda expressions and composition functions like map and filter seem to be more common than list expressions, but most of the python code i've read was written by java developers, so that may just be a foreign dialect intruding.
this is because the modules tends to focus on a much more clearly defined target, which makes the context much narrower.
since this is a plain pipe&filter operation, the way to write it in ruby is imo using filter ops.
for example, date conversion, file format detection, server processes handling, protocol handling and many many more...muni february 15, 2009 7:47 pm this is in response to a question of perl vs python in the field of bioinformatics.
i've deliberately tried not to be too terse.
i mention all this for the sake of showing that i believe that my view on how programming languages compare with each other comes after many years of using and exploring a variety of them in different contexts, and for different needs.
and i previoulsy had c/c++ exp.(ofcoursely relatively very small).
sort contactrecords by skutitle.
the flame war uses list as its battlefield.
bottom line is that a good programmer will even mix his programming languages in a single project when possible to take advantage of their individual strengths.

i am back to my beloved perl and i will never sin again.
i felt like i just went through a 7-year long discussion, and never did it stray away from its initial focus (of python, perl, ruby).
i used rexx for a long time, but use python almost exclusively now.
the algorithm i chose was just the first one that came to mind.
also, if you were inside a function, the my and our definitions would relate to you the scoping the author was trying to achieve.
i coded it first in ruby, and then ported the code to python and perl, changing it as little as possible.
i linked to pdl's web page, and while it looks old, the modules are still in active maintenance and development.
another thing we do is review all commits to follow those rules.
born00slippy i always found perl to rescue me in the toughest of the circumstances :)from /.
i just neglected to make that simplification when porting the code.
for example, we don't write ifs on the same line like: print if $something_happened; we use if ($something_happened) { print; } instead.
generally perl is preferred over python mainly because of the advantages perl modules offer over that of python.
then i tried python and that was another story.
make a new array, contactrecords, that contains arrays of  just the fields we care about: skutitle, contactme, email.
good programmers are rarely impressed with the newest hype or fad, and good programmers can write good code in any language.
my hunch/hope is that they're doing/have-done the same thing with perl 6, but i haven't learned perl 6 yet.
james may 18, 2009 9:41 am only one or 2 people have picked up on this, but not as a major point, but when it comes to maintaining; it is often not the one who wrote the code who has to do it.
good code is easy to read.
the reason i found this is that i was asked to help with something in my company which may require file/text manipulation for a conversion of data from one system to another.
the point i am trying to make is that all languages have their strengths and weaknesses.
is due the existence of novice programmers.
all developers receive those updates).
neil c august 7, 2007 8:00 am this post and comments has confirmed that for me: (1) python code is far easier to read than ruby or perl code.
it is recommendend to do things while (<>) instead.
kerry: i avoided classes because i lacked experience with python and ruby (those were my first programs) and because i'm used to languages where there is a higher overhead (in loc) for introducing a new class.
api/portability differences usually make much more of an impact than syntax.
i'm not saying it is the best, but i reach for perl as my secret weapon over and over again.
(we also review other possible problems in the code.

what i'm looking forward to is a time when: the programming retards have changed profession simple applications are programmed using languages like perl6, java7, c#4, etc demanding/important applications are programmed using languages like haskell, scala, erlang, etc.
you don't understand.
?tbartdev i know this is ot, but seriously, gentlemen, if you want to use console & friends, then please do so responsiby ;-> i say forget grep, awk and whatnot.
python does not have braces for blocks.
use strict; my @contactrecords; my $fields_hash ={email=>17, contactme =>27, skutitle=>34}; my $fields_array =[qw/email contactme skutitle/]; while (my $line=){ $line=~s/"//g; my @record = split /\t/, $line; if ($record[$fields_hash->{contactme}]==1){ my $r={}; foreach my $k (@$fields_array){ $r->{$k}=$record[$fields_hash->{$k}]; } push @contactrecords, $r; } } foreach my $r (@contactrecords){ my $sep=""; foreach my $k (@$fields_array){ print $sep.
i know that sounds strange, but if everybody would be a good programmer, everybody would have used these dynamic languages in the last decade.
but no, it just eats things that look like tags.

i already know that in perl we can write highly readable or highly idiomatic code or both if you write lots of comments.

python is anyway naturally clean perl - 1, python -1 2)
also, i  correctly guessed which classes “owned” the methods and whether  they were mutators.
however, there are "poor" languages, languages that make things difficult or obscure or are just poorly designed.
perl derived some of its functionality from lisp, and since ruby is perl-inspired, i'd expect it has a similar chained mechanism.
i've seen beautiful, clean, maintainable, performant perl code, and horrible, ugly, slow python/ruby code.
when i learned haskell, my java programs became more interface driven.
the algorithm i chose was just the first one that came to  mind.
assume that there are no quotation marks in the interior of the field.
like i mentioned in my comment (jan 7), i look at each new problem/project individually, and try to select the tools accordingly.
tend october 28, 2007 4:12 pm i will agree with tom c that it is more of a matter of style since any language allows you to write in a lengthy or short way.
i already write well-structured, easy-to-read, non-obfuscated code 5.
i do not, and have never liked python's syntax, for whatever reason, i don't like it.
% interesting discussion though!
python needs it as well, but its syntax makes the program code more obvious than its perl counterpart.
what we do to avoid complex constructions is we have our internal rules which developers should follow.

it really helps saving time which would otherwise spent on programming quite simple things.
1 } something_that_builds_a_list(); in ruby, i'd expect you can do: contactrecords = records .collect {...} .reject!
i like the "clean" look of python and will consider for larger scripts/programs especially if other people are going to pick it up and run with it.
my $email = 17; my $contactme = 27; my $skutitle = 34; you may find constant.pm useful in cases like this.

people who insist upon using what is most comfortable for them just because of that fact alone aren't taking into consideration the strengths of each language and utilizing them to their best.
when i look at other people’s code in these three languages, i find it easier and more enjoyable to read python and ruby.
the blocks-by-indentation may be extremely distasteful to curly-brace lovers.
since most of the time you don't know who this will be, i'd always go for perl as it's the most widly known scripting language - even if it gives you the most rope to hang yourself.
it's clean compared to perl, or java, etc.
both are working towards integration with cocoa, but again python is further along.
btw, i write/have written in many languages over the years, including like john, in alc for the 370, cobol, pl/i, c, c++, objective-c (before it was used on the mac :-), java, rexx, python, ruby, sql, etc.
also, i tend to be much stricter with my libraries than with my scripts, especially when it comes to documentation.

to those (like j) who think that languages like perl5, ruby and python are "complex languages"...
the one thing i find really really really annoying in ruby (besides the end all over the place ) is the non autovivifying arrays and hashes.
the reason being that the team that would maintain it afterwards knew python the best.

pm here's another way to do it, using a cpan module called sort::fields.
i guess i need to learn at least two out of the three.
if a programming language could input this and give the correct results, in my opinion, this is the best language.
my scripts are more often than not treated with a weird awe as they can't understand how someone who isn't a "techie" can produce results so quickly... even stupid little scripts such as open (unsorted,"file1.txt"); open (out,">file2.txt"); @orig_list=; @sorted_list=sort(@orig_list); print out @sorted_list; however, my scripts seem to reach critical mass at a certain number of lines (this could well be my lack of skill).
this is what you need: wget -o - http://www.mjtsai.com/blog/files/2002-11-25-sample-input.txt 2>/dev/null | sed -ne '/\("[^"]*"\t\)\{26\}"1"/s#\("[^"]*"\t\)\{17\}"\([^"]*\)".*$#\2#p'
i am a little surprised that compute intensive companies such as google have not pushed the python folks to overcoming this limitation.
remove the elements of contactrecords where contactme is not 1.
i wanted a script to extract from this file the e-mail addresses of people who asked to be contacted when i release the new versions of the products.
#- unless somebody has a nice way to do this ?
i never really did proper learning for programming, only bits of c or php here and there, and as such usually write horrid code.
i prefer to go with perl.
the program reached maybe 500 or 600 lines before i finally refactored it into many modules.
can you also even imagine writing a module containing wrapper methods around the infinity of possibilities regular expressions give you?

hi, interesting thread, .. i am a perl lover that just learnt ruby and indeed i like ruby a lot, partly because it is close to perl in some sense with a lot of built in stuff and a cpan like network with gem ( though less libraries and a lot of beta/alpha code).
but my point is why should you go and hang yourself at all?
i have my own conventions when i program perl so i won't get confused when i read the code later.

it's true that you could drop the "use strict;" pragma and then avoid having to use "my", but imho perl 5's variable scoping options is one of it's greatest features.
17  contactme = 27 skutitle = 34 contactrecords = records.collect {|r|  [r[skutitle], r[contactme], r[email]] } contactrecords.sort!
there is an example below (not tested).
here is my solution to this problem in python: #!/usr/bin/env python import fileinput email, contact, sku = 17, 27, 34 records =
[field.replace('"', '') for field in  line.split("\t")] records.append(record) email = 17 contactme =
recordsand fill it with all the records.
that's a real win for short scripts like this one.
read each line of standard input and break it into fields at each tab.
legibility near the level of line-noise is perl's greatest weakness -- perl developers who write legible code are the exception, not the norm.
that's why i chose java, and i would be more inclined to use python as a scripting language.
my ($email,$contactme,$skutitle,@contactrecords)=(17,27,34); push @contactrecords,[$_->[$skutitle],$_->[$contactme],$_->[$email]] for @records; and not like : my $email = 17; my $contactme = 27; my $skutitle = 34; my @contactrecords = (); foreach my $r ( @records ) { push(@contactrecords, [$$r[$skutitle], $$r[$contactme], $$r[$email]]); } the comment thread clearly needs more code examples: #!
27 skutitle = 34 contactrecords =
here is my preferred solution: http://paste.lisp.org/display/90009 also, read pep8, in python we eschew the use of camelcase.
modules, support, structure, community, and the internet/open source mentality are paving the way for great new computer ideas and languages, as well as changing opinion that programming is just for "geeks".
that was aswell the reason why smalltalk, and even things like objective-c did not had the acceptance that c, c++ and java had.
wrt syntax differences between the three scripting languages), i don't think it's terribly edifying.

as someone in the thread pointed out ... perl is like art and i agree.
i would reccomend that you pick one and use it forever.
my rule of thumb is that if my script gets much longer than 200 lines, it probably has some ideas that i can (and should) abstract into modules.
for example, i quote the original algorithm written in plain english.

leo i know this thread is old, but i couldn't resist to post my perl version.
we use php for such programs.
i argue that this: $t=~s/\s+//g; is more maintainable than: t.removeallwhitespaces() because real perl programmers would know exactly what the first line did without having to look at some other function/method, and if they understand the rest of the code, they might know instantly whether that line is doing the right thing or not (otherwise hope the comments/docs are good ;) ).

{ my @record = map {s/"//g; $_} split("\t", $line); push(@records, @record); } i really do not see the need for the intermediate @record variable, and from the description above it seems to me that you may really want push(@records, \@record); instead (in which case it's still not really needed either).
that improves readability when you try to follow.

learning the language behind it (tcl or python) is going to be a lot easier than writing the hundreds of thousands of lines of existing code yourself.japhy someone already mentioned how you should be sorting after you've removed the unwanted elements from the array.
i realize that this particular example rather lends itself to a simple procedural approach, but as someone who uses python and java regularly, i would have done something very similar to bbum's solution except i would use a class rather than a dictionary or an array of arrays.
ruby follows perl with its integrated regex support.
currently one my hobbies is to play with math intensive coding that explores the intricacies of the zeta function and the riemann hypothesis (all programing done in perl).
" no code that works and is easy to understand is powerful.
the advantage over your example is that the sort comes after the grep, thus avoiding sorting records you are going to reject anyway, the same with quotes.

foreach my $r ( @records ) { push(@contactrecords, [$$r[$skutitle], $$r[$contactme], $$r[$email]]); } .... .... hundreds of lines of code here .... .... .... foreach my $r ( @contactrecords ) { my @rec = @{$r}; #--- contactrecords is an array of records print join("\t", @rec), "\n"; } of course i know that every perl programmer will assume that @contactrecords is like that...
and this is to say nothing about the syntax.
the beauty with any good agile language (like these three) is that while you can get started quite easily, the deeper you understand it the more productive you get (and the richer programs you can easily create).
ruby follows the perl idiom of bazillions of ways to accomplish the task, but only gajillions (which is much less than bazillions) of them are ruby-esque.
s/\s+//g is perfectly readable.
i am impressed with the opinions and insights.
imho good, supportable program should not have them - it requires knowing language to read them.
contactrecordsto standard output, with the fields separated by tabs and the records separated by newlines.
now, i am actually planning a little pet project for home automation, and is torn between perl and python (thus i'm here, no ruby tho, my brain just refuses to comprehend no matter how much i read it).
apart from style (i prefer ruby, it is a cleaner design to my view, like smalltalk, but with cleaned-up perl things like integrated regex), there are other things that may sway you for a particular project.
python, perl and indeed php have many similar problem domains, and there is no question, that if i am in one of those domains, i prefer python every time.
each field is wrapped in quotation marks, so remove them.
of course if you're building a large collaborative website, choose your environment first (like my personal favourite openacs or perhaps zope).
this obviously ignores the fact that both are used by many many people, but that doesn't make them "better" by any means.
(2) list comprehensions are much clearer to read than map/filter/lambda (3) the .join string method is a blight upon the otherwise clear python syntax.
it has worked well for me 3.
this is a huge leap forward for programming.
good code is optimized late.
otherwise, and more similarly to what you did, my ($email, $contactme, $skutitle) =
standard and defacto standard ways of doing common tasks make for better maintainability.
and for what i do, python has two annoying quirks, both related to performance.
perl is easy to maintain, scale, and debug.
i have recently started to dabble with python and, thanks to this great article/discussion will also look at ruby.
