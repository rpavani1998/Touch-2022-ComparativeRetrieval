the r learning curve is very much worth it if you ever need to do anything beyond simple data manipulation that you are comfortable with in other programs.spss is a good tool that does not demand the steep learning curve of r. most data are not clean when you get them, they have missing data, outliers, etc.it’s free, far more usable than gimp (another open source graphics program) and suits very well my needs.not only is processing pretty easy, but it has such a great user community.it makes flash so much better for guis and interactive datavis.i’m pretty heavily into tableau, excel and sql and have looked at r, but frankly it looks like the learning curve is too long to be worth the investment when tools like tableau are available (if you have the funds) which do a very good job.good for simple visualizations; simple data manipulation, cost effective, and it can handle the conversion between a report layout to a viz.tableau is expensive and not as flexible as i’d like, but there’s a subset of tasks (basically making visualizations of 2 to ~5 dimensional data stemming from an sql query) for which it is excellent.it's important to have actual data when you're learning, because the visualization tool that you use will depend on it.the upside of flash is that it tends to load faster than java, and more people have flash than java installed on their computer.it’s compatible with firefox, safari, chrome, opera, and (with the explorer canvas script), internet explorer, and it works quite nicely.the numerical python module – aka numpy – is great for data analysis and getting one’s head quickly around the data.for analysis there are a lot of analysis tools, and the preferred one will change depend on who you ask.ultimately, visualization is not just about using one piece of software, but having a full toolbox at your disposal.the tool uses in-memery analysis and is able to show all data at once.
