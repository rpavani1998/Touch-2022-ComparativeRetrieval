if you a re a windows user, you need to grab a  couple of installation packages to get started: a current release of python itself ( download) windows extensions, for database access ( download) you can  install these programs in-place, by telling windows to run the install file,  rather than save them to disk.
there you will also find references for the syntax to connect to your favorite windows database using odbc.

input file using the brownie parameterization for analysis by program mark.
in this case, mysql was used, but the  methods for other databases, such as access, postgresql and oracle, are similar: nesting success:
it is often useful  to write a short program to do this automatically, especially when more than  one (or one very complex) input file is required.
using python to create input files shaping raw data into the appropriate input file for analysis via mark,  capture, and other programs can be time consuming and fussy.
after you have installed python and downloaded one of these sample files,  you should be able to right-click a file in your file manager, and select  "edit".
