most people use adobe illustrator.
processing then has a nice speed for showing things.
java and html parsing don’t seem to go together at all.
you might also be able to get away with just a little bit of code if you use just flash, although, if you really want to get serious with visualization, you'll need to learn actionscript.
for art processing definitely seems to be the software of choice for artists and  designers.
i like the earlier user’s suggestions of using python for the data parse and then processing for the actual viz step.
the key here is not to use the default settings.
you might also be able  to get away with just a little bit of code if you use just flash, although, if  you really want to get serious with visualization, you'll need to learn  actionscript.
i use openoffice for table analysis, because it does the same as excel, and it has comparable graphing capacity, but costs nothing.
is the visualization for a publication?
here are a few worth checking out: the above is a very small subset of what's available.
for anything more complicated than table analysis spreadsheets are no good idea, you have to go for real stats packages.
plus, you don't need to include many details in a graphic made for presentation slides, because people can't see them from far away.
we’ve built a number of our own actionscript libraries for dataviz.
example: the new york times many want to add some spice to their presentations.
some have suggested using the open-source alternativeinkscape.
there are a lot of analysis tools, and the preferred one will change depend on who you ask.
i love processing but something that it cannot beat is flash interactivity and it’s graphics rendering tree object model.
it's just a matter of deciding which one suits you best.
plus it's  free and open source.
i’ve been playing with parallel sets as well.
here are a few worth  checking out: infochimps freebase many eyes
you'll be limited to  their offerings though.
if you need to do any statistical analysis (which in my opinion would help a lot of visualizations be a lot more informative), you should really look into r.
personally, i don't use it much for graphics since i'm comfortable with r  and illustrator.
another awesome software is nodebox (that is python based too), unfortunately it’s for mac-users only.
illustrator is kind of pricey however.
oh, and let's not forget all the government organizations that have departments dedicated to putting together datasets.
interesting to see what others are doing.
as a note, john resig (the principal author of jquery, among other things) ported the processing framework to javascript, which makes it much more web-friendly.
good for simple visualizations; simple data manipulation, cost effective, and it can handle the conversion between a report layout to a viz.
probably not the most ideal method, but i’ve actually used php (+gd2) when drawing images derived from large data sets that reside in mysql databases.
illustrator is the most common choice for non-interactive graphics  since it gives you drag-and-drop control over all the elements.
i'm going to assume you have a programming background if you're looking to do visualization for a web application.
i then viz it with tableau so it is interactive.
the end result is a java applet.
it’s free, web-based, and completely drag-and-drop.
you can use the same software as the above, but there's also not much harm in using microsoft excel despite the stigma.
great thread…i agree about the many tools in the toolkit one that i’m starting to like is ethority; for a bi solution it put some thought into the data visualization functionality.
but before we get into what you should use, a couple of questions.
http://www.juiceanalytics.com/demos/airline/ http://media.juiceanalytics.co.....pdemo.html (view-sourceable) juicekit really isn’t for data-exploration–we use excel and nodebox for that (tableau, of course is great too)–but about publishing ny times quality visualizations.

pingback: links for 2009-09-03 « glenna deroy nice site!
i use mathematica for pretty much anything where more than a couple of curves are required.
if the people that ordered the analysis don’t understand the viz the work is useless.
example: the new york times for presentations many want to add some spice to their presentations.
it’s compatible with firefox, safari, chrome, opera, and (with the explorer canvas script), internet explorer, and it works quite nicely.
i have been to each of the web-based data sources you mention but had forgotten about 2 of the 3.
most people use excel.
do you want to use better-looking graphs in your slide presentation?
if not, go  find one.
for larger datasets flare seams more suitable for this task.

what's the purpose of your visualization?
examples: many eyes, rescue time processing definitely seems to be the software of choice for artists and designers.
many of the other tools for publication on the web are new to me.
again, it goes back to how easy it is to learn and how much you can do with it.
are you working on a web application that has some graphs?
the above is a very small subset of what's available.
i run vista under vista.
upsides are programatic graph generation, quality & wide variety of plot types.
for web presentations, amcharts is an option.
most people use  adobe illustrator.
even if i feel my questions are lame, i always get a useful answer.
the upside of flash is that it tends to load faster than java, and more people have flash than java installed on their computer.
the numerical python module – aka numpy – is great for data analysis and getting one’s head quickly around the data.
pingback: what visualization tool/software should you use?
tableau is expensive and not as flexible as i’d like, but there’s a subset of tasks (basically making visualizations of 2 to ~5 dimensional data stemming from an sql query) for which it is excellent.
examples: many eyes, rescue time
i like it you can make very concise javascript expressions to make quite sophisticated mappings from data to marks-on-screen.
this means graphics like what you see in the newspaper.
i've also heard a lot of good things abouttableau software.
i love online-tools ;-).
http://raphaeljs.com/ a very cool svg-based alternative, in alpha stage and being written by mike bostock, a stanford cs grad student of flare’s author jeff heer, is protovis (http://protovis.org/)

here is an example of a good geotemporal one in action: http://tiny.cc/jfogk it’s called geotime interesting thread, nathan.
hi nathan, i’m use the import-functions from google docs (spreadsheets) for data-scrapping.
our online tools are usually done with flash or flex.
it can be also free if you use opensource flex sdk for actionscript programming.
i also use a lot of python and beautiful soup for manipulating data.
from r, you can import your  file as a pdf into illustrator.
plus, you don't  need to include many details in a graphic made for presentation slides, because  people can't see them from far away.
oh wait, i got a full post a while ago!
i also use inkscape a little to tidy up r plots and add additional annotation i heart processing, especially offline, because java applets are annoyingly long to start.
the free vista (athttp://www.visualstats.org and at http://www.uv.es/~prodat/vista ) allows – among full multivariate stats – to run a visual exploratory data analysis under windows, mac and unix.
check out what he’s done athttp://www.gapminder.org as well.
for quick plots, excel is fine.
there is a user group, too.

http://www.amcharts.com/ great post, nathan.
what visualization tool/software should you use?
then, i’m embed diagrams, google maps, tables etc.
the good news is, well, that there are a lot of (free) available tools out there to help you get started.
you can either do stuff in the actual flash program, or you can use actionscript for a pure coding solution.
hopefully you already have a dataset that you're interested in.
the data i work with is rarely clean or structured in a way ready to be vized.

beautifulsoup is a good python library to parse html (and xml) pages: http://www.crummy.com/software/beautifulsoup/ great pointers on public databases.

again, what you decide here will affect what tool you should use.

not only is processing pretty easy, but it has such a great user community.
â€“ getting started | flowingdata « netcrema – creme de la social news via digg + delicious + stumpleupon + reddit python is very good for static visualizations.
it's important to have actual data when you're learning, because the  visualization tool that you use will depend on it.
the  first isprocessing, which was designed to make coding easier and to give you  more bang for the buck.
ultimately,  visualization is not just about using one piece of software, but having a full  toolbox at your disposal.
you can  actually do a lot in microsoft excel and make it look good.

in particular, we want to make it easy to make flare visualizations that work with flex data binding.
if you want to do something more complicated than your traditional graphs,  you can design it by hand in illustrator or your can do it inr (either  programmatically or with one of the add-on libraries), which is a software  environment for statistical computing and graphics.

the flare visualization toolkit is a good place to start.
i was disappointed you didn’t mentioned the javascript infovis toolkit as a web visualization tool (http://thejit.org).
it's just a matter of  deciding which one suits you best.
is  the visualization for a publication?
for web visualizations, i’ve recently had great luck with flot.js for standard line charts.
are you looking to get into data visualization, but don't quite know where to begin?
i’d say that if you’re looking for a nice integration with web standards the javascript infovis toolkit is a good option.
example: processing gallery what software do you use?
but it is the one that ordered that analysis who counts.
we use tableau for brainstorming ideas (with whatever db is needed).
oh, and let's not  forget all the government organizations that have departments dedicated to  putting together datasets.
do you just need it for analysis?
the others only paint a picture.
i wouldn’t call it a begginers level though.
for analysis there are a lot of analysis tools, and the preferred one will change depend  on who you ask.
it’s a very good alternative to processing in some specific jobs.

from r, you can import your file as a pdf into illustrator.
now, if you're developing for the web, there are two main options here.
then our designers use illustrator to mock up the viz.
to that end, processing is a lot easier to learn coding-wise.
is it an interactive  tool?
you can either do stuff in the  actual flash program, or you can use actionscript for a pure coding solution.
but all this needs much time to learn so that you can smoothly use it.
downsides are cost, and very steep learning curve.

either way, the end result is something that runs in the flash environment.
unlike excel which has to be refreshed, tableau is active and interactive.
i’m pretty heavily into tableau, excel and sql and have looked at r, but frankly it looks like the learning curve is too long to be worth the investment when tools like tableau are available (if you have the funds) which do a very good job.
the only product that we’ve come across that can cover all three of the traditional, single visualization techniques – spatial, temporal, and link analysis – is geotime.
my doings lean a little in the art direction, but i’m originally from the infovis side.
i use lyza fromhttp://lyzasoft.com to not only connect to many data sources and transform, but to figure out what data to look at with profiling and verify it is valid.
