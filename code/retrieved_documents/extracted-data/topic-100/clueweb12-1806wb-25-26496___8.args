the integrated components allow a program file to have both r and latex syntax interweaved.
the software and the data sets can be freely downloaded and all the examples can be reproduced on the reader’s own computer.
thanks for agreeing to the interview, jeffrey.
to the best of my knowledge, this cannot be performed in commercial software packages, as there is little or no cooperation.
my biostatistics team analyzes data from the scientific sections to answer substantive research questions.
dr. long answers questions about his book and how he uses r in his work in behavioral sciences.
read more today's interview is with mark hall one of the original core developers of the weka (waikato environment for knowledge analysis) data mining software.
r code and data sets are available on the “supplements” tab.
dr. long answers questions about his book and how he uses r in his work in behavioral sciences.
to the best of my knowledge, this cannot be performed in commercial software packages, as there is little or no cooperation.
the result is that new and useful tools can be used immediately for researchers who need them.
i am the head statistician for neurobiological predictors of huntington’s disease (predict-hd), funded by the national institutes of health and the chdi foundation, inc.
commercial software was a concern because of its cost and availability, and i turned to the open source r system for statistical computing and graphics ( http://www.r-project.org/).
for professionals in my field, open source means that software can be made available simultaneously with new methods that are introduced in professional publications.
author of the book “longitudinal data analysis for the behavioral sciences using r“.
the beneficiaries are researchers and students who want a practical introduction to the analysis of longitudinal behavioral data.
the method is highly desirable in my work, as databases are updated continually requiring the updating of reports.
the statistical analysis is performed in a pre-compilation step, and the results are embedded in the tex file, which is compiled to produce the final pdf report.

you'll not only learn how to program in r, but also how to find the right user-contributed r packages for statistical modeling, visualization, and bioinformatics.
for students, open source is important because it makes world-class statistical software available regardless of one’s personal or institutional resources (except for an internet connection).
the entire book was written using the integrated components that i previously mentioned.
my expertise is applied statistics in the behavioral and medical sciences.
the joy of the book was digging deeper into the open source software.
my expertise is applied statistics in the behavioral and medical sciences.
i learned many tips and tricks along the way that have increased efficiency in my daily professional work.
