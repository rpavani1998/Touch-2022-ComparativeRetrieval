the bottom line is that it has increased our productivity.”
python + pandas is fast enough for most production use cases while still providing all the advantages of an agile research environment.
what about java, c++, and c#?¶ while systems languages satisfy your need for performance, low-productivity  and low-maintainability are deal-breakers for a research environment.
python has long been great for data munging and preparation, but less so for data analysis and modeling.pandas helps fill this gap, enabling you to carry out your entire data analysis workflow in python without having to switch to a more domain specific language like r. combined with the excellent ipython toolkit and other libraries, the environment for doing data analysis in python excels in performance, productivity, and the ability to collaborate.
some of our users have found themselves able to replace java systems with 20% as much python code!
the simplicity and elegance of its api, and its high level of performance for high-volume datasets, made it a perfect choice for us.”
butpandas also seeks to solve some frustrations  common to r users: r has barebones data alignment and indexing functionality, leaving much  work to the user.pandas makes it easy and intuitive to work with  messy, irregularly indexed data, like time series data.pandas also  provides rich tools, like hierarchical indexing, not found in r; r is not well-suited to general purpose programming and system development.
it is the most widely-used open source environment for statistical modeling and graphics, and it provided some early inspiration forpandas features.
pandas enables you to do large-scale data processing seamlessly when  developing your production applications; hybrid systems connecting r to a low-productivity systems language like  java, c++, or c# suffer from significantly reduced agility and maintainability,  and you’re still stuck developing the system components in a  low-productivity language; r’s “copy-left” gpl license prevents use in most  commercial software development.
python andpandas use a permissive bsd  license allowing use in commercial software.
pandas does not implement significant statistical modeling outside  of linear and panel regression; for this, look to thestatsmodels project.
first of all, we love open source r!
r users will be pleased to find this library adopts some of the best concepts of r, like the foundational dataframe (one user familiar with r has describedpandas as “r data.frame on steroids”).

vbench python data analysis library¶ pandas is an open source, bsd-licensed library providing  high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the python programming language.
we have foundpandas easy to learn, easy to use, and easy  to maintain.
what problem does pandas solve?¶ python has long been great for data munging and preparation, but less so  for data analysis and modeling.pandas helps fill this gap, enabling  you to carry out your entire data analysis workflow in python without having to  switch to a more domain specific language like r. combined with the excellent ipython toolkit and other libraries, the  environment for doing data analysis in python excels in performance,  productivity, and the ability to collaborate.
library highlights¶ tools for reading and writing data between in-memory data  structures and different formats: csv and text files, microsoft excel, sql  databases, and the fast hdf5 format; intelligent data alignment and integrated handling of missing data: gain automatic label-based alignment in  computations and easily manipulate messy data into an orderly form; flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets; intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing , and subsetting of large data sets; columns can be inserted and deleted from data structures for size  mutability; aggregating or transforming data with a powerful group by engine allowing split-apply-combine operations on data sets; high performance merging and joining of data sets; hierarchical axis indexing provides an intuitive way of  working with high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional data structure; time series-functionality: date range generation and  frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear  regressions, date shifting and lagging.
even create domain-specific time  offsets and join time series without losing data; the library has been ruthlessly optimized for performance , with critical code paths compiled to c; python with pandas is in use in a wide variety of academic and commercial domains, including finance, neuroscience,  economics, statistics, advertising, web analytics, and more.
