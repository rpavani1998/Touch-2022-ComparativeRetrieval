lush's main features include: a clean, simple, and easy to learn lisp-like syntax; a compiler that produces very efficient c code and relies on the c compiler to produce efficient native code; an easy way to interface to c functions and libraries, and a powerful dynamic linker/loader for object files or libraries written in other compiled languages; the ability to freely mix lisp and c in a single function; a powerful set of vector/matrix/tensor operations; a library of over 10,000 numerical routines, including full interfaces to gsl, lapack and blas; a library of image and signal processing routines; a extensive set of graphics routines, including an object-oriented gui tookit, and interface to opengl, and an interface to openrm; an interface to the simple directmedia layer (sdl) multimedia library; sound and video grabbing (via alsa and video4linux); several libraries for machine learning, neural nets, statistical estimation, etc.; libraries for computer vision and 3-d scene rendering; javavm and python c api bindings.lush is designed to be used in situations where one would want to combine the flexibility of a high-level, loosely-typed interpreted language, with the efficiency of a strongly-typed, natively-compiled language, and with the easy integration of code written in c, c++, or other languages.security is maintained, in the sense that false results are difficult to forge, by embedding a cryptographic signature in the outgoing requests which must be detected in any received response.it implements extremely fast and efficient port, host, and network trace scanning, and does so with two completely separate and disconnected processes -- one that sends queries, the other that receives responses and reconstructs the original message from the returned content.nevertheless, there are commercial indexing services competing with pubscience, which offer some data for free, but often charge substantial sums even for viewing the abstracts (and will likely raise their prices now that the free competition is out of business).it turns out that many, many non-random datasets will have extraordinarily apparent regions in 3-space with increased density, reflecting common rates of change of the apparently random dataset.these regions are referred to as strange attractors, and can be used to predict future values from an otherwise random system.if you do research and development in signal processing, image processing, machine learning, computer vision, bio-informatics, data mining, statistics, simulation, optimization, or artificial intelligence, and feel limited by matlab and other existing tools, lush is for you.in fact, lush is designed to be very simple to learn and easy to use.a pubscience search result would give you the abstract of an article and a link to the publisher's page, where, depending on the publisher, you could either view the article for free, or buy it.minewt's ability to manipulate mac addresses also allows it to demonstrate guerilla multicast, which allows multiple hosts on the same subnet to receive a unicasted tcp/udp datastream from the outside world.you'll find a horrific number of dead links, but the installation of a dsl line at my unindicted co-conspirator's place will allow me to get back to occasional updates in the near future.through this process, paratrace can trace a route without modulating a single byte of tcp/layer 4, and thus delivers fully valid (if occasionally redundant) segments at layer 4 -- segments generated by another process entirely.after intense lobbying from the software & information industry association (siia), the united states department of energy has shut down the pubscience database.data mapping is accomplished by interpreting the file as a one dimensional stream of integers and progressively mapping quads in phase space.
