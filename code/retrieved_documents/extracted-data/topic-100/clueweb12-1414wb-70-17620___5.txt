lists and tuples both lists and tuples consist of a number of objects which can be referenced by their position number within the 284c object.
"marmalade" third = something[2] and have the letter  "r" assigned to the variable third.
in technical jargon, a tuple is immutable by a list is mutable.
you can change a list but not a tuple!

if you want to  perform an operation on element of a dictionary, you can find out the keys  using the keys method print starter.keys() for  example since you can't know what the elements are called just be looking at a  count of the number of elements as you can with a list or tuple.
so it's  natural that it's incomplete.
if you're familiar with perl hashes, php associative arrays or tcl arrays, then you have a good parallel to a python dictionary.
"cheese" for example if i want to replace the tuna.

i can create a tuple by writing fruit = ("apple","banana","cherry","fig","grapefruit") and then refer to fruit[0] to refer to apple, and so on.
you'll notice that when i created the list i used [...] notation, and when i created the tuple i used (....) notation, but when i refer to elements later i do so using square brackets every time.

in  technical jargon, a tuple is immutable by a list is mutable.
the most frequent example you'll come across is called an "array" - but exactly what that does varies from language to language as a c array is very different to a tcl array, for example.
a tuple is much more efficient in use, and there are many occasions  you want to set up a collection of objects in order (an "ordered  collection") and refer to it many times later on.
