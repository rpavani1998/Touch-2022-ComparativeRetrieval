additionally, it has the broader goal of becomingthe most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language.
the data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data structure the two primary data structures of pandas, series (1-dimensional) and dataframe (2-dimensional), handle the vast majority of typical use cases in finance, statistics, social science, and many areas of engineering.

robust io tools for loading data from flat files (csv and delimited), excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast hdf5 format time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, moving window linear regressions, date shifting and lagging, etc.
for r users, dataframe provides everything that r’s data.frame provides and much more.
pandas is built on top ofnumpy and is intended to integrate well within a scientific computing environment with many other 3rd party libraries.

pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data: - tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an sql table or excel spreadsheet - ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.

some other notes pandas is fast.
here are just a few of the things that pandas does well: - easy handling of missing data (represented as nan) in floating point as well as non-floating point data - size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from dataframe and higher dimensional objects - automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and letseries, dataframe, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations - powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data - make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other python and numpy data structures into dataframe objects - intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing , and subsetting of large data sets - intuitive merging and joining data sets - flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets - hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)
pandas is the ideal tool for all of these tasks.
if you haven’t used numpy much or at all, do invest some time inlearning about numpy first.
pandas will soon become a dependency of statsmodels, making it an important part of the statistical computing ecosystem in python.
it aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in python.
many of the low-level algorithmic bits have been extensively tweaked incython code.

so if you focus on one feature for your application you may be able to create a faster specialized tool.
