while sweave is a great invention for reproducible research, there are other packages which can improve r’s default sweave functionality.a sweave document is dynamic in the sense that everything in the document can be changed by the r code (nothing is hard-coded), so we don’t need to worry too much about the specific numbers and plots in the output.in all, it is a whole lot easier and faster to write latex documents in lyx. this is the main reason for an easier life of sweave, because a sweave document is nothing but a mixture of latex and r code.this will make the style of graphics completely consistent with the body of a document, e.g. the fonts.pgfsweave while sweave is a great invention for reproducible research, there are other packages which can improve r’s default sweave functionality.this is the main reason for an easier life of sweave, because a sweave document is nothing but a mixture of latex and r code.but i have to confess it is a really nasty script — (for windows) it calls several system commands to help the configuration, such as initexmf or mpm, or setx to set the system path variable; this is a dangerous practice and some users may feel extremely uncomfortable with it.but i have to confess it is a really nasty script — (for windows) it calls several system commands to help the configuration, such asinitexmf or mpm, or setx to set the system path variable; this is a dangerous practice and some users may feel extremely uncomfortable with it.this is my suggestion (and contribution), and i think this makes sense because many users just do not care about formatting r code (hence torture other people’s eyes), so let’s do it automatically with pgfsweave.in all, it is a whole lot easier and faster to write latex documents in lyx.the video below can give you an idea on what it looks like in lyx (chinese visitors please go to photobucket or 56.com to watch the video): as we can see, r code can be easily embedded into lyx. if you are familiar with sweave, you don’t even need time to learn anything.under mac and linux, it tries to download and copy files to your home directory so that latex and lyx will work properly.this packages uses the tikzdevice package to produce pgf/tikz graphics which are essentially latex code, in other words, the r graphics are represented in the latex language so that they are treated (compiled) in the same way as the body of a latex document.there might be some text editors which can automatically do this tedious task, but the more serious problem is i cannot see the whole picture — in my eyes there are only commands; my imagination is limited — it is difficult for me to imagine\section{} to be a section title.there might be some text editors which can automatically do this tedious task, but the more serious problem is i cannot see the whole picture — in my eyes there are only commands; my imagination is limited — it is difficult for me to imagine \section{} to be a section title.
