the sort() method of list objects in python is quite flexible.
you can use this script from the command line using options, or import it into another script.
see, it takes some digging around to get what you need, but now since i’ve done the work for you, you can now do linear regressions from python.
your docstrings end up looking so nice that sometimes it makes you want to write more of them!

polar bar plot in python published on july 20, 2008 in matplotlib, plotting and python.
turns out python can’t convert everything perfectly, and a little more exploration is in order.
for example, a list of strings is sorted by the first letter of each string.
first, you need the packagevegan installed, which is fantastic for multivariate stats.
rather than recap it all here, i encourage you to grab a copy of the source code, in which you can find the examples directory.
here’s a heavily commented script, rpy-demo.py, that will: if you have rpy installed and the vegan package installed, you should be able to just run this python script.
it’s very easy to make subplots that share an x-axis, so that when you pan and zoom on one axis, the others automatically pan and zoom as well.
i showed you how to read excel files with python.
xlwt allows you to format your spreadsheets on a cell-by-cell basis or by entire rows; it also allows you to add hyperlinks or even formulas.
my solution for now is to use a localtiddlywiki as the glue for my figures, since i can embed figures in tiddlers (the microcontent entries that are the bread and butter of tiddlywikis), and tag and search those entries.
lm(x,y) ordination = rda(data) for much, much more see the online documentation for rpy, but hopefully i gave you enough to at least get started.
p = summary['coefficients'][1,2] ok, say you have this data set to perform redundancy analysis (rda) on.
sphinx can automagically slurp in all your docstrings, format them nicely, and render them as html or pdf output.
in order to write data to an excel spreadsheet, first you have to initialize a workbook object and then add a worksheet object to that workbook.
your docstrings end up looking so nice that sometimes it makes you want to write more of them!
it’s calledsphinx, and you can see what the documentation looks like by checking out the documentation for python itself (v.2.6 and 3.0).

the dictionary you get back may take some navigating.
useful tidbits for using open source software in science here’s how to get a nice automatic documentation of your python code usingsphinx.
see, it takes some digging around to get what you need, but now since i’ve done the work for you, you can now do linear regressions from python.
(which of course would result in better-documented code).
often-run analyses that you need r for can be wrapped in a class or module to encapsulate your data analysis needs, so you don’t need to clutter your code with it.
organizing them on disk just isn’t cutting it.
pyephem (from the greek word ephemeris) is the way to calculate the positions of all sorts of astronomical bodies in python.
rather than recap it all here, i encourage you to grab a copy of the source code, in which you can find the examples directory.
ax.bar(theta, radii, width=width, bottom=0.0) # step through bars (a list of rectangle objects) and # change color based on its height and set its alpha transparency # to 0.5 for r,bar in zip(radii, bars): bar.set_facecolor( cm.jet(r/10.)) bar.set_alpha(0.5) show() and the result: it’s very easy to make subplots that share an x-axis, so that when you pan and zoom on one axis, the others automatically pan and zoom as well.
non-trivial example here’s an example of some data where the dates not formatted well for easy import into excel: 20 sep, 263, 1148, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 12.1, 13.9, 1+1, 19.9 20 sep, 263, 1118, 0, 1, 0, 360, 0, 14.1, 15.3, 1+1, 19.9 20 sep, 263, 1048, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 14.2, 15.1, 1+1, 19.9 20 sep, 263, 1018, 0, 1, 0, 360, 0, 14.2, 15.9, 1+1, 19.9 20 sep, 263, 0948, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 14.4, 15.3, 1+1, 19.9 the first column has the day and month separated by a space.

excel_date_fmt # weather data has no year, so assume it's the current year.
you can optionally specify an image name (relative to the output file, see the documentation in the source code) to be embedded.
organizing them on disk just isn’t cutting it.
(which of course would result in better-documented code).
let me know if you find bugs so i can fix them.
some highlights from the examples directory in the source code: dates.py, which shows how to use the different date formats hyperlinks.py, which shows how to create hyperlinks ( hint: you need to use a formula) merged.py, which shows how to merge cells row_styles.py, which shows how to apply styles to entire rows.
lm(x,y) ordination = rda(data) for much, much more see the online documentation for rpy, but hopefully i gave you enough to at least get started.
save the ordination as a png print the variance explained by constrained and unconstrained axes as well as each rda axis.

xlwt allows you to format your spreadsheets on a cell-by-cell basis or by entire rows; it also allows you to add hyperlinks or even formulas.
bonus: i can zip everything up and send tiddlywiki + images to my advisor so he can browse and search them as well.

sphinx can automagically slurp in all your docstrings, format them nicely, and render them as html or pdf output.
the goal is to have a simple excel file where the first column is date, and the second column is temperature.
well, that makes more sense, and you can see the p value for the slope is 2.75e-5.
