in fact, tools used by data-crunching journalists are generally useful for a wide range of other, non-journalistic tasks -- and that includes software that's been specifically designed for newsroom use.that could appeal to it departments seeking a way to offer this type of service in-house, allowing end users to turn a google doc into a filterable, sortable web database using the google visualization api, google query language, javascript and jquery -- without needing to manually generate that code.the platform includes powerful statistical analysis capabilities.like that previous group of 22 tools, these range from easy enough for a beginner (i.e., anyone who can do rudimentary spreadsheet data entry) to expert (requiring hands-on coding).as the communications channels we use continue to proliferate and evolve, so too have the vulnerabilities.working on a command line means learning new text commands (not to mention the likely risk of typing errors), which might not be worthwhile unless you work with csv files fairly often.end users can easily create their own databases from spreadsheets without writing code.and by joining tables, you can make more "intelligent" pivot tables and charts to explore and visualize large data sets with excel's point-and-click interface.at this year's conference, i learned about other free (or at least inexpensive) tools for data analysis and presentation.it also lets excel act like a relational database by adding the capacity to truly join columns in different tables instead of relying on excel's somewhat cumbersome vlookup command.the visualizations are slick and highly interactive; clicking an area in one visualization also affects others in the dashboard.freedive's chief current attraction is the ability to create databases without programming; however, freedive source code will be posted and available for use once the project is more mature.drawbacks: search capability is fairly basic and cannot be narrowed by column or by using wildcard or boolean searches.and because it's so powerful, some users say that implementations must consider how to winnow down functionality so as not to overwhelm end users.even non-technical users can easily upload and search data.
