i'm looking for skills development and tools i can use day-to-day.blender is apparently beefing up its api for external calls and automation; as a visualization person, i'm interested in tools that i can "drive" with data as input.(the gist being that since a lot of data handling involves discrete steps to clean and transform, you can put these steps into little modules that allow you to view the big picture of what's going on with your data munging.)other examples: a talk onpypes by eric gaumer included a good reminder that big data problems existed in the search engine space long before other kinds of big data became "hot" to work on.i have big hopes for the evolution ofprocessing.py and nodebox2, two pythonic visualization options, but i am not sure they're there yet for me as a data vis person.i aimed for cloud data and machine learning.his slides and a bunch of other interesting supporting material (including code) are upon his site.i was there as a data-oriented geek, but i saw ux opportunity everywhere, for the right kinds of ux folks.there were a lot of talks on data, big data, cloud data, and scaling python (to handle big data and data problems).i also really enjoyed the talk on genetic algorithms by eric floehr, a fellow who seems to do weather prediction consulting.this spring i went to pycon in atlanta, since i've been using python more and more for data analysis problems.a final comment for any ux folks reading this: this would've been a great audience for a talk on ui design in open source, or ui design for python ui's.another talk on big data that was well-tweeted was c. titus brown's "handling ridiculous amounts of data with probabilistic data structures.his french accent was very nice, but i kept mishearing "scikit-learn" as "psychic learn." :-)his talk on text analysis was very good as well -slides
