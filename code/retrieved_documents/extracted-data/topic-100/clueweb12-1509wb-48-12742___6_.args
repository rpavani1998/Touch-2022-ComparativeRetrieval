it will be advantageous to my career to learn how to do some basic gis stuff.this means that is capable of raster, vector, table data analysis, interpolation, linear regressions,modelling etc etc the gisvm-r has python installed (and the eric ide) with rpy 1.0.1, so python can access the r libraries and run calculations.there are packages to work with the existing postgresql database system, and i have found that any odbc data source is very easy to work with on windows.second, some software that i think would be really useful to have on there: r for statistical analysis (http://www.r-project.org/)and doing this in a vm is great as it seems like something you could easily specialize your whole os for.i just installed mysql because it is my favourite database and it is commonly used for "light" projects, so r has the rmysql package but also the rodbc for any db access.as far as the cron jobs go, i am not sure that releasing a suspended vm would help - the monthly cron jobs are executed when you release the product one month and a user runs it for the first time the next month.second, some software that i think would be really useful to have on there: - r for statistical analysis (http://www.r-project.org/)thanks, « last edit: october 22, 2008, 10:55:43 am by admin » logged jnylen newbie re: r, saga, other minor things «reply #2 on: october 23, 2008, 08:59:57 am » i was not aware that r required mysql?  there are packages to work with the existing postgresql database system, and i have found that any odbc data source is very easy to work with on windows.this program could still be run manually prior to each release.i have set postgresql up to work with odbc before on linux, so the same is probably true there.i already received a gisvm-r version from a user that installed r and several other tools over the current gisvm.it does seem like that job is the main culprit of the slowdown.i am not sure how you might prevent this (release on the 2nd of the month) but it made the system very sluggish for about 20-30 minutes.or if it turns out to be a bad idea to remove it, /etc/crontab would be easily modified to run it every 3 months or something similar.
