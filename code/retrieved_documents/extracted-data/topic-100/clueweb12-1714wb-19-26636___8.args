but while its simplicity makes it a good choice for pedagogical examples, it's not a toy system.
the server is implemented using python and twisted, which are required.
a given language has rules about allowable names, allowable values for a given name, and the context in which the binding is valid (the binding's scope).
nws is designed to be a coordination facility that is language neutral.
you must install both the server (on one machine) and a client (on all machines involved in the computation).
many developers work with newer dynamic languages like python and r. to meet the needs of these users, we've developed a python-based coordination system called "networkspaces" (nws) that is easy to learn, accessible via almost all development environments (including r, java, octave, python, perl, and ruby), and deployable on ad hoc collections of spare cpus.
for example, python nws can automatically handle composite data structures: >>> from nws.client import networkspace

while we describe the python client here, the ideas transfer to other language clients.
inexample 1 below, for instance, you can use nws to move data from python to r encoded as an ascii string.
even though nws is implemented in python, we have networkspace client apis for a variety of languages.
performance improvement via parallelism should be of interest to anyone whose codes run too slowly.
most values in most of the languages mentioned can be automatically serialized (the serialization is done behind the scenes by nws, and is not of direct concern to programmers).
because this is a concept familiar to programmers, it is a good foundation for building a coordination system.
we've used nws to run parallel programs on hundreds of processors, producing many cpu years of useful computation.

the advantages this neutrality offers include: nws coordination patterns and idioms can be recycled from one language environment to the next.

thus, a simple assignment looks like this in nws: ws.store('x', ws.fetch('y'))so far, we've succeeded in making a fairly routine construct more verbose.

unfortunately, due in part to its history, parallel programming languages and tools still mostly focus on "big iron" and older languages such as c and fortran.
nws is designed to be a coordination facility that is language neutral.
a given language has rules about allowable names, allowable values for a given name, and the context in which the binding is valid (the binding's scope).
the values can be any native type in the client language for which that language has a workable serialization.
the key point is that the nws encapsulation is amenable to a network-based implementation, which lets different processes exchange data and synchronize via nws bindings.
in many languages, including python, we could have used syntax similar to that of normal bindings: ws.x = ws.y
the server is implemented using python and twisted, which are required.
to facilitate interlanguage coordination, nws variable names are ascii strings and don't need to conform to the variable naming rules of any given language.

the advantages this neutrality offers include: >>> from nws.client import networkspacefinally, ascii strings used as values are treated in a special way (they are not subject to the client language serialization protocol) that makes it possible for them to be exchanged across client languages.
the language also provides operations for establishing a binding and for retrieving the value of a bound name.

using this encapsulation, we explicitly specify the look-up (fetch), the association of the namex with the retrieved value (store), and the intended binding set (indicated by thews object).
