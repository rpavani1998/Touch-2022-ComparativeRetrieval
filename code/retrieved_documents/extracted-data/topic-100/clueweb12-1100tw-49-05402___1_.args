plot charts on a dataset class prerequisites good knowledge of basic statistics (min, max, avg, sd, variance, factors, quantiles/deciles, etc.)after completion of the course, you will be able to: - understand concepts of data science, related processes, tools, techniques and path to building expertise - use unix command line tools for file processing (awk, sort, paste, join, gunzip, gzip) - use excel to do basic analysis - write and understand r code (data structures, functions, packages, etc.)after completion of the course, you will be able to: understand concepts of data science, related processes, tools, techniques and path to building expertise use unix command line tools for file processing (awk, sort, paste, join, gunzip, gzip)business apps often deal with datasets that fit in excel/access - products: desktop tools (excel (solver, what if), access, sql, spss, stata, r, sas, programming languages (ruby, python, java) -- stats libs in these languages, bi tools, etc. b) steps in data science - acquire data: "obtaining the data"... databases, log files... exports, surveys, web scraping etc. - verify data - cleanse and transform data: outliers, missing values, dedupe, merge - explore data:use excel to do basic analysis write and understand r code (data structures, functions, packages, etc.)- explore a new dataset with ease (visualize it, summarize it, slice/dice it, answer questions related to dataset) - plot charts on a dataset class prerequisites - good knowledge of basic statistics (min, max, avg, sd, variance, factors, quantiles/deciles, etc.)business apps often deal with datasets that fit in excel/access products: desktop tools (excel (solver, what if), access, sql, spss, stata, r, sas, programming languages (ruby, python, java) -- stats libs in these languages, bi tools, etc. b) steps in data science acquire data: "obtaining the data"... databases, log files...here you will find daily news and tutorials about r , contributed by over 300 bloggers.visualize data interact with data (not covered here): bi tools, custom dashboards, other tools (ggobi etc.)r-bloggers.com offers daily e-mail updates about r news andtutorials on topics such as: visualization ( ggplot2, boxplots, maps, animation), programming ( rstudio, sweave, latex, sql, eclipse, git, hadoop, web scraping) statistics ( regression, pca, time series, ecdf, trading) and more...awk, gzip, gunzip, paste, sort etc. - office tools: excel (plugins like solver, what if) - statistical tools: r, sas, spss, stata, matlab, etc. - bi tools d) learning r we will pick a tool to learn the concepts of data science.exports, surveys, web scraping etc.books, conferences - analyse your favorite dataset: e.g. cricket data analysis - compete (kaggle) - learn other tools (excel solver, sas etc.)data-driven business functions e.g. mroi, mix optimization, ipl teams / fantasy teams, predictions - big data - definition: data sets that no longer fit on a disk, requiring compute clusters and respective software and algorithms (map/reduce running on hadoop).data-driven business functions e.g. mroi, mix optimization, ipl teams / fantasy teams, predictions big data - definition: data sets that no longer fit on a disk, requiring compute clusters and respective software and algorithms (map/reduce running on hadoop).
