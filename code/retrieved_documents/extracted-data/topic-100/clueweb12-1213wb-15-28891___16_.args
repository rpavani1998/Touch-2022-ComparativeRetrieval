computational chemists are not programmers, but programming is an essential skill for developing new algorithms, generating data, and analyzing results.up-to-date information can always be found at http://dalkescientific.com/training/. computational chemists are not programmers, but programming is an essential skill for developing new algorithms, generating data, and analyzing results.r is a great software environment for statistical computing and generating plots.ipython enhances the normal interactive python interpreter to make it better for exploratory programming.most working scientists have little training in programming and end up spending a lot of time figuring out how to parse a file format or work with a software library, rather than figuring out the science.ipython ipython enhances the normal interactive python interpreter to make it better for exploratory programming.r includes its own programming language and a number of high-quality analysis packages.i am a professional software developer with years of experience creating tools for cheminformatics, molecular modeling, bioinformatics, and related fields.this course is meant for computational chemists who want to set up an in-house cheminformatics server for specific analysis tasks.many tools, especially in molecular visualization and chemical informatics, have python interfaces.i teach training courses in python programming for computational chemistry, with an emphasis on cheminformatics.despite the best efforts of some, there's still very little direct influence of xml in computational chemistry.i've developed a set of chemistry extensions to mysql so you can get some experience in doing chemically-aware queries, like substructure searches and similarity ranking.attendees must have some programming experience (know how to use variables, for-loops, if-statements, and know how to use text editors and command-line tools.my courses are meant for computational chemists who are not programmers but have some programming experience.
