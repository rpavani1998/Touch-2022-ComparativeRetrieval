xml is well-defined by the w3c. it would make sense to have similarly well-defined, carefully specified meta-languages for cl languages.
we want to hide the plain text of our message byencrypting and decrypting it — basically, by keeping the algorithms for encoding and decoding secret and private.
we have been warned for years, by everyone from the government to our own doctors, about the dangers of junk food diets, of which the chocoholic’s diet is an example.
which means that you always need to use “rb” and “wb”, regardless of the kind of object that you are pickling.
i have had the situation where a module grew to the point where it needed to be split into two modules.
in short, as a methodology the use case approach is too mushy to provide any real guidance in gathering requirements.
which reminds us that, in a different context, even speech itself — language — may be regarded as a form of encoding.
basically, that function specifies what the gui will do when the button is clicked.
for instance, we can describe the process of a member borrowing a book and the process of returning it, the process of reserving a book and the process of notifying a member when a reserved book becomes available for checkout, the process of sending out overdue notices, and so on.
and we can always throw a red herring into the mix — assigment statements like a = b = 0 suggest that python supports chained assignments, and that assignment statements return values.
when i make the changes, my editor automatically creates a backup file: projectx/projectx_constants.py.bak.
my example problem will be “miss grant’s controller”, which is based on an example problem from the introduction to martin fowler’s new (2010) bookdomain-specific languages.
i’m thinking of books likebeautiful code and dreaming in code.
the communication between “normal” modules and globals modules is a two-way street.
one potentially attractive view, is that the concerns of computer science are bounded by the interface between the computer and the world outside it….
for computer professionals, it is tempting to blame such problems on the clients.
the folders are hidden folders, so depending on the windows settings you may not see them, but they are there.
on the other hand, we may wish to say that our plain text looks like this: 26 upper-case letters, 26 lower-case letters, 10 numeric digits, the space character, and a dozen types of punctuation marks: period, comma, double-quote, left parenthesis, right parenthesis, and so on.
they choose to make it a rule that a class can inherit from as manyfully abstract classes it wants, but can inherit from only onepartially abstract class.
well, first of all, you don’t need to give the function a name.
i’m pretty sure that if i work with rest long enough — and read allof the documentation — i will eventually grok it.
i get confused when i read this in the rest documentation: a paragraph is a chunk of text separated from other chunks by one or more blank lines.
to put it bluntly, the requirements analyst’s first job is tostudy and understand the problem, not to jump right in and start proposing a solution.
one of the subversion tutorials that i found said that you must checkout your workingcopy from the main repository, because you can’t do a checkin back to the main repository if you hadn’t checked it out.
in those use cases, we don’t care about what the lambdareturns, we care about what it does.
each function will be used only once, by the particular button to which it is being supplied.
[italics mine -- steve ferg] – michael jackson, “the real world” rephrasing this point in terms of use cases: it is almost impossible for programmers to build correct software if they are given use case information but no information about the problem domain and how their program relates to what happens there.
in creating the domain model we, in a sense, construct a dictionary of words.
a “clean copy” is a copy of only the source-code files, without the .svn directory.
as i write this, i realize that i don’t know how to tell pycharm to close a file without also writing it to disk.
if we succumb to its charms, we eat an unbalanced diet.
[note that this applies only if you are using an email client such as thunderbird, outlook, outlook express, etc.
for example, the “rename” application might accept both this rename -o file_a.txt -n file_b.txt and this rename --oldname file_a.txt --newname file_b.txt
comments (2) the best computer keyboards ever made (even when compared to the original ibm model m keyboards) were the northgate omnikey keyboards.
you hear the sound of my words and decode it back into ideas.
the upside of doing step 2 is that it enables a smart cl parsing module automatically to generate user documentation for the cl language, and to dump that documentation to the screen when it finds a syntactic or semantic error in the command line, or when the command line is a request (
but given the popularity of the buzzword “object-oriented”, i think it is important to point out that the object-oriented-ness of use cases is a myth.
in the slideshow, you can see the top of the keyboard sitting on a little green box that lifts it about 2.75 inches (7 cm).
the take-away here is that you need to pay special attention to backing up your email files.
a bout of online research convinced me that we really need more ergonomic keyboards, so i went shopping for one.
that’s a lot of characters.
so now i don’t use star imports anymore.
the technique is extremely simple.
but i’m doing a bit of shouting and arm-waving here because i think that somewhere there is probably at least one person for whom this post might be useful.
in embedded systems, the system’s reliance on properties of the surrounding real world are very real, and can often be safety-critical.
so the backup utility didn’t see the appdata directory, and didn’t back it up.
the subversion docs describe the update command this way: when working on a project with a team, you’ll want to update your working copy to receive any changes other developers on the project have made since your last update.
the connection between the quality of the requirements-gathering for a system, and the quality of the system that is eventually developed, seems to be invisible to most organizationsregardless of whatever particular requirements-gathering methodology the organization is officially practicing.
you can invent your own from scratch if you wish, but life is a lot easier if you at least follow some standard conventions when you do.
you add in characters for the funny squiggly/accented/umlauted characters in spanish, french and german.
1776 is a “big endian” number because the “biggest” (most significant) digit is stored in the leftmost position.
(i think that one of my email files must have been corrupt, and when i compacted it, the compaction process wiped out messages that should not have been wiped out.)
superedit "a christmas story.doc" "clement moore" support of quoted values means that command-line parsers must be more sophisticated… just splitting the command line on whitespace won’t do the job.
so i must not be moving,” and would not allow the pilot to engage reverse thrust.
the mappings between natural languages are too loose to guarantee that a piece of information can make the round-trip without losing something in translation.
i use thunderbird (on windows vista) as my email client.
note that it imports mem and also imports the subordinate module, minion.
note that line 2 wraps around and there is no horizontal scrollbar.
but in order to keep things simple, i will talk as if a project is just a directory.
then you can use it wherever you like.
it is not possible for an ordinary human to understand all of the ways that a grab-bag of 50, or 100, or 200 use cases are inter-related.
hammers don’t work well when you’re trying to drive a screw, nor when you need to cut a plank.
around the edges of the chip socket, carefully cut off any remaining prongs.
the tools/scripts directory contained two scripts (crlf.py and lfcr.py) with illustrative examples.
it discourages the requirements analyst from examining the problem domain, by focusing attention only on what happens at the system boundary.
so if you’re not backing up your email files, take a look atfive ways to keep your emails backed up (and read the comments, which are useful) or google something like“email backup”.
i also found that once i had the chip lifted up, but not completely free of the motherboard, a needle-nose pliers was perfect for the final removal.
as ben kovitz points out, writing software requirements by writing use cases as they come to mind, is the requirements-writing equivalent of programming by hacking around.
how to remove the programmable chip from a non-evolution programmable keyboard for other programmable northgate keyboard models (models ending in a p for “programmable”) — 101p, 102p, ultra tp and ultra p — you can use basically the same procedure as described above for the evolution.
first, we start with the idea of a piece of information — a message — that exists in a representation that is understandable (perspicuous) to a human being.
and because you’re in a funny mood, instead of calling the numeric identifiers ”numeric identifiers”, you call them “code points”.
unfortunately, the situation is muddled by the fact that in python an expression can also be a statement.
northgate evolution keyboard what i really wanted, of course, was an ergonomic version of the omnikey ultra.
basically, the rule says that you can inherit from (extend) as many classes as you want, but if you do, onlyone of those classes can contain concrete (implemented) methods.
steve ferg ] i know there is “commit” which puts my changes into the respository, but i still have the files checked out under my working folder.
turn the keyboard over, so that it is face up and you are looking at the keys.
an export will be about half the size of a checkout due to the absence of the.svn folders that duplicate all content.
what’s wrong with chocolate is that it is delicious.
note that (1) first, a normal chunk of relatively short lines of python code.
in this case, fortunately, the ambiguities were so glaring that they could not be ignored.
relational database concepts data modeling (entity-relationship modeling) data-driven program design software requirements and specifications object-oriented programming domain-driven design event-driven programming data structures and algorithms process modeling, entity life-history modeling popular software design methods/tools/ideas software development management programming languages added january 5, 2010 propositional logic (to help with those tricky if-then-else tests) sets and set theory of possible interest to those interested in systems analysis methodologies.
here’s where joel spolsky’s (joel on software) excellent post the absolute minimum every software developer absolutely, positively must know about unicode and character sets (no excuses!) comes in useful.
practising programmers who try to adhere to this doctrine will find themselves devoting their skills to tasks that seem at best arbitrary and at worst senseless.
if you wish, you can initialize the global variables when you create the class.
the takeaway lesson for me was that using star imports will cripple a static code analyzer.
that is why, for instance, we can’t use one natural language (russian, chinese, french, navaho) as an encoding for another natural language (english, hindi, swahili).
on input, if newline is none, universal newlines mode is enabled.
so there is a simple rule for coding english text (i.e. text that uses only or mostly ascii characters) — always use utf-8.
the thing that really makes keys that begin with a single dash different from keys that begin with a double dash is not that they are one character long, but that their length is fixed and known.
the result is a keyboard that is shaped like a v rather than like a straight unbroken line.
i think a “side cutter” pliers would be too big for this job.
omnikey ultra keyboard i used only northgate omnikey ultras for years, lugging them from job to job like an itinerant medieval carpenter carrying his tools with him from town to town, and usingspecial keyboard plug adapters when keyboard plug design evolved first to ps/2 and then to usb.
it smacked of sneaking global variables in through the back door, and of course everybody knows that globals are always bad.
the cables are short, and virtually impossible to re-attach if you pull them loose.
as a simple example, we might want to start a text editor and also tell it the name of a file that it should open, like this superedit a_filename.txt in this example, “superedit” is the name of the application, and “a_filename.txt” is a command line argument: in this case, the name of a file.
you’ve just discovered sumerian cuneiform characters from the middle east and sanskit characters from india.
so i had no backup of the deleted messages.
this technique produces a program structure like this: open input file f read a record from f # get first while not endoffile on f: process the record read the next record from f # get next close f i won’t try to explain when or why the read-ahead technique is preferable to the standard loop.
basically, regardless of the kind of object that you are pickling (even a string object), the object will be converted to a bytes representation and pickled as a byte stream.
by now, you would expect that we would have recognized that fact, and have learned to deal with it.
because the use case approach is not object-oriented, it is completely compatible with non-object oriented methods.
if we feed these lines to greed, we get: line a line b line c no surprises there.
instead of functioning like a true class, it functions as a simple container object.
the first point is that no information can be lost during encoding or decoding.
before long i had a monster on my hands, and i needed a tool that would look through all of the scripts and programs in the system and do (at least) some basic error checking.
you can recover deleted email messages … but not after the email file has been compacted.
if the workingcopy directory does not exist on your pc, it is created.
you need different tools for different jobs.
there is no pre-built alternate shortcut configuration for windows-like behavior.
in actual practice, most utf-8 files do not include a bom.
under the circumstances, the syntax for lambda had to be shoe-horned into the established python syntax in a “pythonic” way.
second, on most windows editors (and things like netbeans and eclipse, too) if you try to close a file that has unsaved changes, the editor will warn you and ask you what you want to do.
they were designed so that certain key combinations (e.g. pressing the left shift key four times) puts the keyboard (that is, the programmable chip) into programming mode.
the customers knew that they wanted the system to generate reports, so the system specification included a use case torun reports .
although there are some general styles that programmers often use when implementing the command-line arguments for their applications, basically every programmer is free to do whatever he (or she) wants.
python, it turns out, is the ideal language for creating executable jsd specifications.
cl languages are like markup languages.
on your pc, the project’s top-level workingcopy directory has a hidden .svn subdirectory.
which means that recently i started trying to learn subversion.
when you view your postas html, what you should see is square brackets around the shortcut tags, not pointy brackets.
or, just for fun, consider this… a young programmer, fresh out of computer programming school and still wet behind the ears, asks you — tough old seasoned professonal software developer that you are — for suggestions for things that he/she should learn in order to become as tough, as old, as seasoned, and as professional as you.
if newline is any of the other legal values, any'\n' characters written are translated to the given string.
but in most cases some other kind of container would do as well as a class.
if you look closely in your working copy, you may see an .svn folder in each folder of your working copy.
note that the reason an exported folder cannot be updated is that the update command updates the .svn directory of a workingcopy, but an export does not create an .svn directory.
so, for a project named “projectx” the workingcopy directory will be named “projectx”.
generators make it easy to convert a sequence into a kind of object that provides both aget next method and anend-of-file mark.
i thought it might be interesting to compile a list of books in which programmers talk about programming.
as programmers, we think of plain text as being written text.
[directory] the subversion documentation says this about workingcopy directories: a subversion working copy is an ordinary directory tree on your local system, containing a collection of files.
it would really be helpful if all subversion tutorials would stop using the term “checkin” and replace it with “commit”.
here’s another clue: a passage from pragmatic version control using subversion: subversion has a highly efficient network protocol and stores pristine copies of your working files locally, allowing a user to see what changes they’ve made without even contacting the server [where the central repository is stored].
for example, flag concatenation (see below) is possible because the flag keys have a known and fixed length.
i had only one prong left stuck in the motherboard, and i gently twisted it off with the needle-nose pliers.
it must be possible for us to send a message on a round-trip journey — from plain text to encoded text, and then back again from encoded text to plain text — and get back exactly the same plain text that we started with.
the basic idea is that the fixed-width encodings are very long — ucs-4 and utf-32 are 4 bytes (32 bits) long — long enough to hold the the biggest code value that we will ever need.
and you don’t want to try to commit files if your workingcopy/.svn is out of sync with the central repository.
the recipient knows that the file is in utf-16 encoding.
we can talk about options and optionality later, when we look at semantic concepts.
this paragraph will result in an indented block of text, typically used for quoting other text.
note that — at this point — although project_utils.py has been “added” to the copy of the project in the workingcopy, the main repository still doesn’t know anything about it — project_utils.py hasn’t been added to the central repository on the server.
so, since pyflakes can’t tell whether target_langage is (a) an undefined name or (b) pulled in via some star import, it does not report target_langage as an undefined name.
our only job is to figure out how to make the system do what they tell us they want it to do, in their use case descriptions.
in particular, each directory in your working copy contains a subdirectory named .svn, also known as the working copy’s administrative directory.
normally, if your file contains an undefined name — say target_langage — pyflakes will report it as an error.
if you are using a northgate keyboard with any other system, the programmable chip is basically a bad chip and should be removed.
because a subversion workingcopy directory needs a .svn subdirectory in order to work properly, you can have problems with subversion if you accidentally delete the .svn subdirectory.
i suspect that rest by its very nature has a lot of gotchas.
on the upside, though, pycharm provides a lot of support for keyboard shortcut customization, and you can customize the keyboard shortcuts to the behavior that you want.
the take-away here is that you need to pay special attention to backing up your email files.
unfortunately the programmable chip had software that worked only with windows 98 and earlier.
leader and minion communicate solely by means of the variables set in mem.
that kind of object can easily be processed using the read-ahead technique.
third, i googled the web looking for the kinds of things that you’d expect: subversion tutorial introduction beginning beginners commands.
as the collabnet documentation (quoted earlier) says: when you do a subversion checkout, every folder and subfolder contains an .svn folder.
a bit of cheering and arm-waving is in order, simply to catch some attention.
at the time, i felt sort of stupid doing this.
we could deal with this problem by routinely enclosing all filename positional arguments in quotes, but that would be clumsy and laborious.
it will tell you, among many other things, how the famous wwii navaho codetalkers could talk about submarines and dive bombers… despite the fact that there are no navaho words for “submarine” or “dive bomber”.
(jackson says that the error, which could have been catastrophic, fortunately was not.)
in this code snippet, wraplines="false", so lines are not wrapped, but extend indefinitely, and a horizontal scrollbar is available so that you can scroll as far to the right as you need to.
this is what miss grant’s controller looks like when the action structure diagram is translated into python.
carefully lower the top of the keyboard back down onto the lower part.
next, (for reasons that we won’t explore right now) we need to be able to translate a message in a plain-text representation into some other representation.
he runs across examples that use lambda, and wants to understand what he’s seeing.
in contrast, jackson system development (jsd) specifications focus on the events and the sequence in which the events may occur.
one of the bit combinations won’t identify a character at all, but will be sort of a continuation sign, saying (in essence) this character identifier is continued on the next several bytes.
because of my familiarity with this kind of version control, i had a certain “mental model” of how a version control system works.
this is something you should do frequently, because you don’t want the files in your workingcopy/.svn directory to get too far out of sync with the file in the central repository.
do not release the esc key until the computer beeps at you, or you have to do something like entering a password.
if i simply create the file in the projectx folder, it will be an “unversioned” file in just the same way that projectx_constants.py.bak is an unversioned file: it will not exist in the projectx/.svn directory, so subversion knows nothing about it.
the email files were stored in a directory called appdata, and the appdata directory is a “hidden” directory.
produces this output 1 name 'reverse' is not defined 2 3 'str' object has no attribute 'reverse' 4 'str' object has no attribute 'reversed' fortunately, the solution is not too difficult.
most importantly, use cases can be an effective tool when they are developed in a disciplined manner, as part of a methodology that first creates a well-defined domain model.
consumed in moderation, as part of a well-rounded diet, chocolate adds variety and pleasure to the diet, and in some cases may provided needed calories.
an important feature of any useful requirements-gathering methodology is that it provides asystematic approach to identifying all of the system requirements.
you will find a way for computers to handle your ucs.
the key to what will work is the new “newline” argument for the built-in file open() function.
in our example, the sigil was a dash (a hyphen).
finally, if you’re looking to purchase a keyboard with buckling spring key switches, you might check out the customizer line of keyboards at pckeyboards.com.
if the life of a library book includes events such as being acquired, being borrowed, being returned, etc., then the analyst will develop a use case for each of those events.
button expects a function object as an argument to the command parameter.
for now, i prefer to take a practical, pragmatic position: so the bottom line for me is that there are occasions when some kind of globals-like technique is the best tool for the job.
it is possible to copy your local working copy of the file into the repositorywithout unlocking the file in the repository.
often, for example, an important requirement for a system is that it enforce (or at least not violate) a set of business rules or governmental regulations.
in a case that i heard about recently, a requirements analyst was working on a project for a large american railroad corporation.
the upside is that this nasty incident led me to learn some things.
these code points are used for nothing else than to indicate byte order.
the model processes running in the machine are synchronized with their real-world counterparts by means of events – events sent from the real-world processes into the machine.
rename file_a.txt file_b.txt then the position of the arguments identifies the value.
use cases are simply not the best tool for capturing such requirements.
that was when, thanks to the twin miracles of the web and google, i found bob tibbetts and hisnorthgate keyboard repair web site.
which brings us to… in this section, i’m going shamelessly to rip off information from jukka k. korpela’s outstandingunicode explained from o’reilly (see the section onbyte order starting on page 300).
specifying a single big module that contains all of the customer’s business rules and (in uml terminology) extends every use case, is possible but clumsy and unnatural.
… a working copy also contains some extra files, created and maintained by subversion, to help it carry out these commands.
why does language matter to philosophy?) finally, note that in other contexts, the “plain text” isn’t even text.
i switched from using a mouse to a using a trackball (i prefer alogitech cordless optical trackman), and that helped a lot.
when we embark on a system development project, the system to be developed is the putative solution to some problem in the user’s environment (the “application domain”).
in fact, utf-8 is what is known variously as a here’s how multibyte encoding works in utf-8.
when we feed this to greed, what we get is roughly (i say “roughly” because in wordpress it is difficult to reproduce the exact html that you get from greed) this: line a line b system message: warning/2 (, line 3) definition list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.
third, you’re doing mostly english, and 8 bits is plenty for working with english.
[directory] projectx.py projectx_constants.py subversion introductions and tutorials often say things that are rather cryptic to someone who is trying to learn subversion.
if you weren’t able to attend, you should really take a look… i’m sure you’ll find something worth watching.
you send the file out into the world, and it is downloaded by somebody running a little-endian computer.
aquaplaning, a very relevant property of the real world, was not considered by the developers when they created the guidance system.
that makes sense: we don’t want projectx_constants.py.bak to be considered a project file anyway.
but even after reading many of the online subversion tutorials, i still could not grok subversion.
so now mike comes along and proposes doing exactly the same thing.
here is a jumbled grab-bag of concepts, jargon, ideas, resources (books), etc.
class mem: pass that is enough to create your mem container.
the major feature of an ergonomic keyboard is a split design in which the left and right halves of the keyboard are split apart, separated by a few inches, and angled slightly so that you can type without bending your wrists.
let’s hope that someday, someone will write a lambda tutorial that, instead of beginning this way lambda is a tool for building anonymous functions.
one thing that i learned was that the disk backup utility that i was using at the time did not backup my email files.
it would be more accurate to say that there are really three directories that you are working with: that means that, on your pc, the projectx workingcopy directory looks like this.
file_b.txt a flag is an argument whose presence alone is enough to convey information to the application.
use case description shouldn’t be theonly tool in the toolbox.
clicking on the collapsed code snippet will cause it to expand.
i often use the university library as a teaching example in my data modeling classes, just because of this ambiguity with the word “book”.
this evening, while web surfing, i happened to run across a reference to coders at work: reflections on the craft of programming by peter seibel, and it occurred to me that recently there have been several new books in which programmers (often, great programmers) talk about programming.
my hypothesis is that pyflakes doesn’t report target_langage as undefined because it can’t tell whether target_langage is truly undefined, or was pulled in by some star import.
if it is '', universal newline mode is enabled, but line endings are returned to the caller untranslated.
the domain model provides an infrastructure for the requirements-gathering process, so that the development of use cases can proceedsystematically, in a way that could never happen without the domain model.
if the first two bytes of a file are 0xfeff or 0xfffe, then a unicode decoder knows that those two bytes contain a unicode bom, and knows what to do with the bom.
i asked thunderbird to compact my email files, and it wiped out a bunch of my email messages.
if you specify wraplines=”false”, and a reader prints a paper copy of your post, the printed output will not show the scrollbar, and it will showonly the portion of long lines that were visible on the screen.
so you start out making your list with your own good english characters.
this explains why most explanations of lambda are confusing for the typical python programmer.
carpal tunnel syndrome forced a friend of mine to retire on disability and put the fear into me.
sometimes, they are worse than useless, because they give the impression that the system requirements have been completely specified, when in fact that is not true at all.
different computer architectures use different endian-ness at the level of multi-byte data items (i’ll call themchunks of data).
some of these gentlemen give lip service to the idea of a well-balance diet, but it is only lip service.
in summary, a set of use cases is a description of the system to be constructed, the thing to be built, the solution to the problem.
so what we have here, in mem, is a truly global container.
the data in the file appears to be scrambled beyond recognition.
it’s not used on linux or macs and just tends to get in the way of things.
in various tutorials, and in the subversion docs, you will run across the expression “clean copy”.
once you’ve done that, you’ve got to figure out a technology for storing all of the corresponding encoded-text characters.
of course, there may be something out there and i just missed it.
turn the keyboard over, so that you are looking at the bottom of the keyboard.
we don’t care how they are represented internally and how many bytes it takes to hold each character in them.
the pycharm online documentation is good, and detailed.
so for the most part, you’ll use only one byte per character, but if you need a document to contain some exotic charcters, you can do that.
commenting on my previous post about unicode, an anonymous commentator noted that the usage of the bom [the unicode byte order mark] with utf-8 is strongly discouraged and really only a microsoft-ism.
third, pycharm offers several alternate keyboard shortcut configurations… but they all seem to be *nix inspired.
for the purpose of writing computer software specifications, it is useful to view a computer software system as a software “machine” that transitions from state to state under the control of an input stream of events.
this should make the computer work normally.
rest just doesn’t seem to work the way i expect it to work.
every python programmer is familiar with one special case of the globals module pattern.
the problem of course is that with 8 bits you can make only 256 different bit combinations.
certainly, it is very unnatural to embed them in the descriptions of specific use cases.
when you do this, you are in a sense “updating” the repository from the working copy.
the solution, of course, is simply to tell the recipient that the file was encoded in utf-16on a big-endian computer.
i’m sure that many experienced python programmers are already quietly using theglobals class pattern.
with the plus sign “+” as a sigil, for instance, it is possible to use flags to turn options on and off.
i asked thunderbird to compact my email files, and it wiped out a bunch of my email messages.
but filenames can begin with dashes.
the translation from plain text to encoded text is called “encoding”, and the translation of encoded text back into plain text is called “decoding”.
as i needed to add new arguments, i was able to add them to just one place — the container.
well, you can lift it a little.
and it was fast, so i could run it through a directory containing a lot of .py files and it would come out alive and grinning on the other side.
the consequence is a plane in a ditch past the end of the runway, instead of safely docked in the terminal.
i should note that i come from a windows background, and i’m used to standard windows keyboard shortcuts and editor behavior.
the collabnet docs say this: they are the same except that export doesn’t include the.svn folders and checkout does include them.
that means that you must eject your poor little string from the warm, friendly, protected home in your python program, where it exists simply as plain-text characters.
basically, the glidepoint cables act as a sort of tether between the upper and lower halves of the keyboard.
when you encounter the expression “working copy” you assume that you are dealing with an ordinary filesystem directory that is being used to hold a copy of the files in your project.
if you run leader.py it imports minion and mem, and uses mem as a container for variable x.
that function object will be the function that the button calls when it (the button) is clicked.
a class that is fully abstract — it has abstract methods, butno concrete methods with those substitutions, you get the familiar java rule: a class can extend at most one abstract class, but may implement many interfaces.
they talk very little about writing stuff *to* imported modules.
in most cases, uca is riding on the coat-tails of uml.
this special character could be any character that cannot occur in either the key or argument value.
the plane’s guidance system thought, in effect, “i’m on the ground, but my wheels aren’t turning.
the goal is to leave no prongs sticking up that might touch each other or anything else.
but — whether or not you realized it — whenever one of your programs wrote or read strings from a file, python was busy behind the scene, doing the encoding and decoding for you.
that’s out of scope for this blog entry, and a good book on jsp can explain that better than i can.
be that as it may, guido has explained why lambda’s syntax is not going to change.
this step is necessary for the parser to do certain kinds of semantic checking: (for example) to automatically reject unrecognized keys, or to automatically report required arguments that were not provided.
i guess i would say it wasn’t a major problem because i found the solution fairly quickly with a bit of googling around.
as far as i can tell, once a reader has expanded a snippet that was initially collapsed, there is no way for him to re-collapse it.
where we should consume a variety of foods to obtain a balanced intake of nutrients, chocolate tempts us to ignore other foods and eat only chocolate.
in short, the printed output might cut off the right-hand part of long lines.
so the backup utility didn’t see the appdata directory, and didn’t back it up.
after using pvcs for many years, our office recently started moving to subversion.
at that point, nobody can unlock it except you.
in this code snippet, wraplines="true", so lines are are wrapped.
what the tutorial was trying to say, i think, was that in order to work with subversion, you must create a workingcopy directory (that is, a directory that contains an .svn administrative subdirectory).
as it happens, i had stumbled onto the arguments container pattern myself, not in python but in java.
but without any training in user-interface design … there is little hope that [the end-users] will make a good job of it.
i’d show you the contents of mem.py, except for the fact that there aren’t any.
so now, when you read a file, you first read the bom, which tells you what encoding was used to create the file.
class pattern is a better tool for the job than globals themselves.
other systems (e.g. systems in the physical and social sciences) are heavily algorithm-driven.
in order for the mapping between the plain text and the encoded text to be very tight — which is to say: in order for us to be able to specify very precisely how the encoding and decoding processes work — we must specify very precisely what the plain text representation looks like.
he also, in a manner of speaking, saved my wrists.
a: java has a rule that a class can extend only one abstract class, but can implement multiple interfaces (fully abstract classes).
so that’s why you — as a python programmer — need to be able to encode and decode text into, and out of, utf-8 (or some other encoding: utf-16, ascii, whatever).
i have had modules that processed nested kinds of things: a, b, and c. it was helpful to have different groups of globals for the different kinds of things.
the obvious techniques don’t work.
but if you try to do that with python 3+, it won’t work.
and it was common to see programs whose top-level control structure looked like (what i will call) the “standard loop”: open input file f while not endoffile on f: read a record process the record close f jackson showed that this way of processing a sequence almost always created unnecessary problems in the program logic, and that a better way was to use what he called a “read-ahead” technique.
file_b.txt an application might permit whitespace before and after the equal sign, like this.
in my experience, greed’s page layout doesn’t work very well under firefox, but works just fine with internet explorer.
procedures were fordoing stuff, and did not return anything.
this also means that if you (in the role, say, of a forensic computer scientist) must process a mystery file, and you see that the file’s first two bytes contain one of the two unicode boms, you can (with a high probability of being correct) infer that the file is encoded in unicode utf-16 format.
to some of them, a “train” was a particular collection of rolling stock (a locomotive and all the cars it pulled).
a while ago, one of my northgate keyboards seemed spontaneously to sustain some kind of brain injury.
– http://www.uidesign.net/1999/imho/feb_imho.html the result, in short, is not only that the user-interface design is being done at the wrong time, it is being done by the wrong people.
but the situation gets more complicated if values can contain whitespace.
when a gui program has this kind of code, the button object is said to “call back” to the function object that was supplied to it as its command.
we only start caring about this when encoding strings into bytes (for example, in order to send them over a communication channel), or decoding strings from bytes (for the other direction).
paragraphs that start indented will result in indented quote paragraphs.
the developer begins by creating a model of the “real world”, i.e. the part of the real world that is relevant to the problem at hand, the part of reality with which the system is concerned and which furnishes its subject matter.
what that adds up to — for at least some newbies — is that it has a lot of gotchas.
the domain model describes the objects in the problem domain, including the events in the lives of objects.
finally, the globals class pattern makes it possible to pass your globals as arguments.
it creates a workingcopy directory containing the project files.
in the memory of big-endian computers, the “big” end of a data chunk is stored leftmost.
these.svn folders contain clean copies of all files checked out and .tmp
i use thunderbird (on windows vista) as my email client.
this means that a data chunk of 0×12345678 is stored as 4 bytes with the most significant byte to the left, like this: 0×12 0×34 0×56 0×78.
it exposes the students to the issue of ambiguity in domain descriptions, and helps me make the point that one of the requirements analyst’s most important tasks is the detection and removal of such ambiguities.
this is a useful technique, and one worth pointing out for the benefit of those who have not yet discovered it.
(and if you really want to “talk unicode”, don’t call plain-text characters “characters”.
everybody is using computers.
rest is trying to do so much (e.g. to support advanced markup structures such as definition lists) with so little (simple ascii text) that it must read a lot into what (in other circumstances) would be meaningless differences.
the (import, checkout) usage pattern for getting started with subversion most “getting started with subversion” tutorials start the same way.
one person who posted a question about this problem on the python forum was aware of the issue, but confused because he was trying to pickle a string.
to help explain, first let me introduce some terminology that i hope will help clarify the situation.
checking out a file gives you exclusive update privileges on it until you check it back in.
i simply stopped using “global” and got rid of all those “global” statements that were cluttering up my code.
but as long as the programmable chip is still in the keyboard, similar problems can occur again at any time.
they were frustrated by the fact that a jsd model process is a coroutine, but cobol – the programming language in use in the business community where jsd was most popular – did not support coroutines.
to others, a “train” was a regularly scheduled run, as in “i’ll catch the 6 o’clock train to boston”.
but for every such reasonable guru, there is at least one snake-oil salesman pushing use cases as the solution for all your requirements methodology needs.
this allows you to decode the file into code points (however code points are represented internally in your programming language: java, python, whatever).
but we can not describe a use case in which a university member presses a button that triggers the rocket launch of a weather satellite into orbit.
and because, in those olden times, ascii was pretty much the only game in town, you didn’t need to specify that you wanted to write and read your files in ascii.
the command-line parser must recognize and correctly handle quote characters… and escaped quote characters inside of quoted strings.
so you go to open a file and start reading.
so here is the code for a python driver program that creates a sequence of event objects and feeds them to the python specification for miss grant’s controller.
as i say, there is a lot to like about pycharm and i don’t want to slam it.
i’m sure other new programmers get confused by it as well… mike’s discussion is excellent: clear, straight-forward, with useful illustrative examples.
occasionally when running on windows i need to read in a file containing windows newlines and write it out with unix/linux newlines.
we start by modeling the real world (rather than describing the functionality that we wish the system-to-be to provide) because the model supplies essential components that we need in order to create our descriptions of the system functionality.
comments (3) with the improved support for unicode in python3, more and more folks will be working with languages (arabic, hebrew, etc.) that read right-to-left rather than left-to-right.
but i code it explicitly, as a reminder that if i ever want to collapse a long code snippet, i can.
carefully turn the keyboard over, making sure to keep the two halves of the keyboard together.
lines in the input can end in'\n', '\r', or '\r\n', and these are translated into'\n' before being returned to the caller.
the result is that whenever you encounter an application for the first time, you can’t safely assume anything about the syntax of its command-line arguments.
if newline is'', no translation takes place.
that means that aglobals class can be passed — as a parameter — from a function in one module to a function in another module.
during the process, i learned that pyflakes is designed to be a bit on the quick and dirty side itself, with the quick making up for the dirty.
next, (for reasons that we won’t explore right now) we need to be able to translate a message in a plain-text representation into some other representation (let’s call that representation the “encoded text”), and we need to be able to translate the encoded text back into plain text.
second, the investigation began with command-line parsers, and in the context of a discussion of parsers and parsing, keyword argument seems a more traditional and appropriate term thanoption.
as grady booch observed [a] very real danger is that your development team will take [its] object-oriented scenarios and turn them into a very nonobject-oriented implementation.
and note that — since different buttons do different things — we need a different function object for each button object.
and the communication is clearly two-way.
i carry a lot of conceptual baggage — it may just be that rest is different from structured-text dialects that i’ve worked with in the past.
on many projects the ambiguities are not so intrusive, so they are left hidden, like ticking time bombs.
in addition, as the editor of www.uidesign.net observed, in many organizations the clients or end-users are the ones who write the use case descriptions.
the good news is that if you have a beloved old northgate that is showing its age, northgate keyboard repair is still in the business of cleaning and repairing northgate keyboards.
one day, in an email to bob, i mentioned that although i loved my ultras (one of which bob was cleaning and repairing at the time), what ireally wished for was an ergonomic v-shaped version of the ultra.
in keeping with the earlier posts’ grandiosity, i will call this use of an imported module the globals module pattern.
first of all, the python language itself masks the distinction between a function and a procedure.
in addition to working with python, i also work with java quite a lot.
when manipulating strings, we’re living in blissful ignorance.
i searched the web without finding one, so i thought it would be interesting to try to write one.
[note that this applies only if you are using an email client such as thunderbird, outlook, outlook express, etc.
and to get it back from a file, you must read the file and decode the collection of 1s and 0s back into plain text.
bob belongs to the school of minimalist website design, but his keyboard expertise and repair skills are totally maximal, and he really saved my bacon keyboards.
use case descriptions that are written at too-high a level are often useless.
the email files were stored in a directory called appdata, and the appdata directory is a “hidden” directory.
in the memory of little-endian computers, the “little” end of a data chunk is stored leftmost.
but by now, knowing about the hidden .svn administrative directory and what it does, you can probably figure that out.
you can use a module as a container.
you can edit these files however you wish, and if they’re source code files, you can compile your program from them in the usual way.
when you run leader.py, you see this output: leader says: foo minion says: foo leader says: value reset by minion from foo leader says: bar minion says: bar leader says: value reset by minion from bar note that leader.py passes no arguments to minion.main() and minion.main() doesn’t return anything (other than none, of course).
the best metaphor for methodology skills is a handyman’s toolbox.
a string consists of characters, which are also abstract entities not tied to any particular binary representation.
i think the use of the globals class pattern makes the work of static code analyzers (e.g. pyflakes) easier.
lift the top half of the keyboard just enough to free it from the bottom half, then rotate the top clockwise about 4 or 5 inches, just enough to expose the programmable chip.
a python function, for instance, can act like a procedure, a function, or both.
or at least, cripple the feature that i most want a code analyser for… to find and report undefined names.
here, the downside of the use-case approach is that it draws the requirements analyst’s attention away from the task of describing properties of the real world, and focuses his attention on the narrow area where the real world interacts directly with the system.
in a sense, the keyboard is bent so your wrists don’t have to be.
at the beginning of this post i said we start with the idea of a piece of information — a message — that exists in a representation that is understandable (perspicuous) to a human being.
these values are “application global”, available to all module in an application.
if a technique is useful, it is useful, object-oriented or not.
it assigns a value to x in mem and calls minion, which reads mem.x and resets mem.x’s value, which leader then reads.
the difference is that non-evolution keyboards don’t have the glidepoint touchpad embedded in the top of the keyboard.
if it has any of the other legal values, input lines are only terminated by the given string, and the line ending is returned to the caller untranslated.
the requirement for a lossless round-trip means that the mapping between the plain text and the encoded text must be very tight, very exact.
this means that, a data chunk whose logical value is 0×12345678 is stored as 4 bytes with the least significant byte to the left, like this: 0×78 0×56 0×34 0×12.
those folders contain the information that subversion uses to link your working copy to the repository.
the rest docs say that in a definition list, “blank lines are not allowed between term and definition.”
for instance, we can think of spoken text as the plain text, and written text as the encoded text.
it worked very nicely.
one of the joys of python is that python makes it so easy to do “standard loop” processing on a sequence such as a list or a string.
the circumstances were very similar to the circumstances that led to the pythonglobals class pattern.
in their methodology books and courses, they pause briefly to give a cursory nod to (for instance) describing the problem domain, before spending the overwhelming bulk of discussion on use cases.
if we need numbers, we can spell them out, like this: “six thousand seven hundred forty-three”.
often, an application will support both single-character and multi-character keys for the same argument.
knowing the order of the bytes within the chunks is crucial to being able to decode the file into the correct unicode code points.
in pascal, for instance,procedure and function were different keywords.
rest seems to be acting they way i would expect it to.
it takes a directory of files — a clean copy of the files, if you will — from your hard drive and copies them into the central subversion repository on the server.
others will stumble across this problem in the future, especially because there are code examples floating around (in printed books and online posts) that will lead new python programmers to make this very same mistake.
a use case description formember checks out a book will use the terms “library member” and “book”, but if those terms have not been defined earlier (in the model of the application domain), then the use case specification is necessarily vague (i.e. not clearly defined).
second, most tutorials introduce lambda as a tool for creating anonymous functions, things whose primary purpose is to calculate and return a result.
now that i think of it, another nice enhancement for wordpress would be to allow a reader to toggle wraplines on and off.
often, at a stage in the project when the primary concern should be understanding the business context and functions that the system must support, the client is instead engaging in premature user-interface design.
if ever you need to get a copy of what’s in the repository, but without all the .svn folders (say for example you’re ready to publish it or hand the files over to your client), you can do an “svn export” into a new folder to get a “clean” copy of what’s in your repository.
most introductions to python tell you all about how to get stuff — that is, how to import stuff — *from* imported modules.
we can specify any function that can be described using the vocabulary of words that appear in the model/dictionary, but we cannot specify a function if its description would require terms that are not in the model.
even help questions and faqs posted on the web can be mystifying.
but the modules still needed to share a common global memory.
the difference between functions and procedures was even built into some programming languages.
note that the long line is not wrapped, and a horizontal scrollbar is available so that you can scroll as far to the right as you need to.
project participants often simply assume that the meanings of familiar terms are so clear and so well known to everyone present, that no explicit definition is necessary.
but if your file includes any star imports, and your script contains an undefined name like target_langage, pyflakes won’t report the undefined name as an error.
basically a checkout copies the project files from the central repository to a workingcopy directory on your pc.
in actual practice, of course, deriving use cases from the domain model is rarely as simple and mechanical as we’ve just described.
virtually all of the system complexity, and all the information needed to design the system, was hidden under the single use caserun reports.
the trick is to use the wordpress [sourcecode] shortcut tag, as documented at http://en.support.wordpress.com/code/posting-source-code/. note that when the wordpress docs tell you to enclose the [ sourcecode] shortcut tag in square — not pointy — brackets, they mean it.
another reason that we start development with capturing information about the real world is there are properties of the real world that constrain the system, or that the system must know about, or that the system relies on, in order to satisfy the customer’s requirements.
in order to gain access to this container, modules simply import it.
note also that you can export from either the main repository or from the workingcopy .svn directory.
we achieve communication when i successfully transmit a thought from my mind to your mind via language.
for english-language speakers, for example, english words printed on a page, or displayed on a screen, count as plain text.
it reminds us that modules — used as containers for “application global” values – aren’t limited to supplying constants and pre-set values.
since mike was talking about arguments, he was talking about a container forarguments.
there is also a pretty nice rest dingus at siafoo, at www.siafoo.net/tools/rest.
the connection between characters and bit configurations is the numeric character identifier, the “code point”.
(4) finally, the same code snippet with collapse=true, so the code snippet initially displays as collapsed.
first, even two bytes are not enough to store a number as big as a zillion.
how to remove the programmable chip from an evolution keyboard first, make sure you have read “the anatomy of an evolution keyboard” (above).
controls will pop up that allow you to pause the show and to step forward and backward.
when coding in python, i occasionally encounter situations in which i wish i could code multiple constructors (with different signatures) for a class, the way you can in java.
but it also has a sort of “continued on the next byte” mechanism that allows it to use 2 bytes or even 4 bytes if it needs to (as it might, for chinese characters).
(i think that one of my email files must have been corrupt, and when i compacted it, the compaction process wiped out messages that should not have been wiped out.)
also note that an export cannot be updated.
in short, the analog of the chocoholic’s diet (in which the unfortunate dieter consumes only, or mostly, chocolate) is what we might call theuse case approach (uca) in which the unfortunate software development organization uses only, or mainly, use cases to gather and document client requirements.
and that means that your happy little plain-text string must be representedby some specific configuration of 1s and 0s, so that when somebody wants to retrieve that collection of 1s and 0s and convert it back into readable plain text, they can.
you can see the glidepoint cables running from the touchpad in the top of the keyboard to the motherboard in the bottom of the keyboard.
but problems come up when handling pieces of data, like large numbers and strings, that are stored in multiple bytes.
- on output, if newline is none, any '\n' characters written are translated to the system default line separator,os.linesep.
for western programmers, that means that utf-8 is both efficient and flexible, which is why utf-8 is the de facto standardard encoding for exchanging unicode text.
how to “reboot” the programmable keyboard shut the computer down.
but it worked, and it made my life a lot easier.
learning that led me to investigate ways to backup my email files, and i found this:five ways to keep your emails backed up for backing up thunderbird files, it recommends mozbackup as being fast, free and easy to use.
comments (6) after my earlier post about northgate keyboard repair it occurred to me that this information might be useful.
fourth lambda is confusing because: tutorials on lambda typically introduce lambda as a tool for creating anonymousfunctions , when in fact the most common use of lambda is for creating anonymous procedures.
what i means is — it doesn’t try to figure outwhat is imported by the star import.
first, it suggested that subversion works like pvcs: that there is a typical round-trip usage pattern consisting of
when you do this, you may break a few of the prongs that hold the chip to the motherboard.
they were heavy keyboards built like tanks, featuring buckling spring key-switchesnotable for their distinctive clicking as you typed.
just as the popularity of the “sugar buster’s diet” has forced doctors and dietitians to issue warnings about the nutritional deficiencies of such a diet, the popularity of the use case approach makes it imperative to point out the deficiencies of use cases as a requirements-gathering tool.
with theglobals class pattern, a module’s globals are actually attributes of an object, a globals class.
so more and more folks will have a need to reverse a string.
so if you’re not backing up your email files, take a look atfive ways to keep your emails backed up (and read the comments, which are useful) or google something like“email backup”.
the importance of white space is touched on in a tip in the official rest introduction, which talks about inline markup – markup for things like italics, bold, monospaced text, etc.
just in case someone might find this useful … i recently had something bad happen to me.
so the development of use cases has a place in the problem solving process… but that place is not as thefirst step, and it is not as the only step.
as i type this, it is almost midnight on march 11, 2011, and bob has only 3 evolution keyboards left.
chained assignment (or more precisely, code thatlooks like chained assignment statements) is recognized and supported as a special case of the assignment statement.
the code was as ugly as sin and a maintenance nightmare.
second, explaining things this way was confusing because subversion doesn’t really have a checkin command.
you add in thecuneiform characters and the sanskrit characters and greek, japanese, chinese, and korean characters.
it should simply be there along with the other tools, so that it is available when it is the right tool for the job.
but even if our clients will let us get away with wiggling out of all responsibility for planes in ditches (something that seems extremely unlikely), this still won’t cut it.
where the plain text is soundwaves (e.g. music), it can be encoded as an mp3 file.
these were real keyboards —no crappy “rubber dome” key switches allowed.
in fact unicode defines not one but several methods of mapping code points to code values.
the workingcopy directory contains everything you need in order to be able to work with subversion, including an .svn administrative directory.
where the plain text is a movie, it can be encoded as a wmv file.
those are the cables that you don’t want to disturb.
that’s part of the reason why we — as a profession and as an industry — continue to do such a poor job of requirements gathering, and continue to have so many system failures.
and that seems to me to be a perfectly reasonable way to do business, not just for pyflakes but for anything short of the super deluxe hyperdrive model static code analyzer.
at this point i can hear a few stomachs churning.
i can live with the risk that i’m re-inventing the wheel.
step 2 can be omitted, but only if the application itself will do the semantic checking rather than expecting the parsing module to do it.
-file_c.txt myprog is going to see “-file_a.txt” and (since it starts with a dash, the sigil) myprog will try to handle it like a keyword argument.
if you are feeling uncharitable, you could say that rest is fragile or flaky; if charitable, you might say that it is very sensitive.
the paragraph is the basic building block of rest.
he was having problems capturing the requirements because his users did not use the word “train” consistently.
when i “commit” my changes, i send the files from my workingcopy to the main repository.
the whole purpose of systems analysis methodologies, in fact, is to provide guidance for situations in which the process is not so simple and mechanical.
a: because java doesn’t support multiple inheritance.
the default for wraplines is true, which causes long lines to be wrapped.
one reason, of course, is that we want to keep a secret.
note that in the following slideshow (showing the repair of an evolution keyboard) you can mouse-over the image.
notice that there is no category for “lazy and stupid people”.
second, even if you decided to usefour bytes (32 bits) for each character, your list might still keep growing and someday even 32-bits might not be enough.
then it emerged that the customer had in mind 140 reports of radically varying content, and the real requirement for the system — what the customerreally needed — was a system that could store a history of all of the kinds of events that could affect securities.
for some applications, there clearly is domain information that must be specified in the system requirements, but which has no natural home in any particular use case.
i was looking for something that would get me up and running quickly.
jsd views a software machine as a simulation in which model processes (coroutines running inside the system) simulate real-world processes.
that means that as a general rule, you should always run an svn update : now, having mastered the concept of an .svn directory, we can understand many things, even arcana such as whyserving websites from svn checkout considered harmful.
(bob noted that he removes the chip from any keyboards that he sells.)
the northgates are programmable keyboards — they contain a programmable chip.
inline markup by itself (surrounded by whitespace) or in the middle of a word won’t be recognized.
showing file changes the reason that subversion can allow “a user to see what changes they’ve made without even contacting the server” is that the subversion diff works only on the workingcopy directoryon your own pc.
i have been able to find an online rest editor.
in order to write a string to a file, you must encode it using some encoding system (such as utf-8).
the need to encode/decode strings when writing/reading them from/to files isn’t something new — it is not an additional burden imposed by python 3′s new support for unicode.
svn update updates the workingcopy, not the repository.
in our example, we could move the initialization ofmem.counter out of the dosomething() function and put it in the definition of themem class.
i’ve posted it here so that it can be available to other folks who might find it useful.
but in the default pycharm configuration, ctl+y is not redo but delete line.
communication happens when i encode my thought into language and say something — speak to you.
to do everything that he needs to do, a software developer needs a toolbox that contains a variety of tools.
after banging my head against the wall for a while, i googled around and quickly found avery helpful answer on stackoverflow.
only after that happens does the new file truly become part of the project by becoming one of the files in the central repository.
you can recover deleted email messages … but not after the email file has been compacted.
in the case of the university library, once we have described the objects in the model, we can specify any system functions that can be described using a vocabulary of “books”, “copies of books”, and “university members”.
right now, we’re not interested in keeping secrets; we’re python programmers and we’re interested in unicode.
note that the model of reality isn’t just something that is nice to have in order to support the descriptions of the use cases.
updated 2011-11-09 to make it easier to copy-and-paste the [sourcecode] template.
when you invoke an application from a command line, it is often useful to be able to send one or more pieces of information from the command line to the application.
jsd uses action structure diagramsto represent model processes.
in the real world, of course, the selection of characters for the plain-text alphabet is influenced by technological limitations on the encoded text.
first, i got a copy of the free online subversion documentation version control with subversion.
second, i got a copy of mike mason’s excellent pragmatic version control using subversion (2nd ed.).
and because of that mental model, many of the subversion tutorials were quite confusing.
only after we have disambiguated the word “book”, can we explain, for instance, why thebook involved in themember checks out book use case is not the same as the book in the member reserves book use case.
a requirements-gathering methodology that consists of writing use cases is no methodology at all, because it provides no help in systematically addressing the problem.
the consequences of excessive chocolate consumption are very real and easy to see (on the bathroom scale, for instance).
the pop-up tools allow a reader to view or print the entire source code snippet if he wants to.
there are short cables that go from the glidepoint touchpad in the upper part of the keyboard to the “motherboard” in the bottom part of the keyboard.
… to run the model, we need to create some test data – a stream of sensor events – that we can feed to the controller.
in contrast, the variable-width encodings are designed to be short, but expandable.
the .svn admin directory contains pristine (unchanged) copies of files that were downloaded from the repository.
as jackson points out in a recent paper, it is almost impossible for software developers to build correct software if they don’t understand the problem domain, and how what they are doing relates to what happens there.
“checking out” a file from the repository means that you get a local working copy of the file, and you lock the file in the repository.
ideally, we’d like for the data in the file itself to be able to tell the recipient the byte order (big endian or small endian) that was used when the data was encoded and stored in the file.
directories that contain temporary files created during checkouts, commits, update and other operations.
so what i’m going to describe may be standard behavior for editors on *nix, and nothing surprising to say, ubuntu programmers.
learning that led me to investigate ways to backup my email files, and i found this:five ways to keep your emails backed up for backing up thunderbird files, it recommends mozbackup as being fast, free and easy to use.
at that point, the organization has got all the methodology help that it is going to get out of the use case approach.
the beauty of using a globals class is that you don’t need to haveany “global” statements in you code.
press the escape (esc) key down and hold it down while you power up your pc.
so this is another reason why we might need to be able to quote argument values: to “hide” a sigil character inside a value.
when you write out the unicode strings, you specify the encoding to be used when writing the bits and bytes to the file.
in more than one case, i’ve seen a project start with scenarios, only to end up with a functional architecture, because they treated each scenario independently, creating code for each thread of control represented by each scenario.
if you click on a tab to close a file (a file with unsaved changes), pycharm saves the file and closes it.
“checking in” a file means that you copy your local working copy of the file back into the repository and you unlock the file in the repository.
as the code evolved,the argument lists got longer and harder to manage.
this post contains information written by a subversion newbie in the hopes that it will be useful to other subversion newbies.
but this creates a bullet item.
we might need to write a command like this, which would cause problems.
i like the fact that you can easily tell when a variable is global simply by noticing themem. modifier.
first of all, on windows ctl+z is the standard shortcut key for undo, and ctl+y is the standard shortcut key for redo (or in some contexts, do again).
comments (8) this post is for folks who blog about python (or any programming language for that matter) on wordpress.
in describing a university library application, for example, in the real-world model we would describe books and copies of books, describe what counts as being auniversity member for the purposes of using the library, and so on.
there aren’t many essential nutrients in chocolate, of course, but in and of itself that is not a problem.
what you need is a standard marker at the beginning of files to indicate what encoding the file is in.
first of all, the termoption tends to be unix-specific; on windows the term parameter is more frequently used.
naturally, we can make our plain-text alphabet much larger if we know that we can use a technology that supports a larger encoded-text alphabet.
as part of this process, it basically ignores star imports.
what i found was that there was one particular piece of information missing from most of the tutorials and introductions that i found.
the command svn add projectx_utils.py will add the file to the project by copying projectx/project_utils.py to projectx/.svn/project_utils.py.
if we eat an unbalance diet, we suffer.
you might say that rest by its very nature has a very highinterpretation-to-signal ratio.
whatever object-oriented-ness use cases have, they have acquired solely by rubbing up against true object-oriented methodologies into whose company they have fortuitously fallen.
utf-8, for example, can use as few as 8 bits (one byte) to store latin and asciicharacters code points.
python for example has a “method resolution order” algorithm that determines the order in which superclasses are searched, looking for an implementation of foo().
the key point from that documentation is this: newline controls how universal newlines works (it only applies to text mode).
my old code worked just fine running under python2 (on windows).
first of all, you don’t have to go putting “global” statements all over your code.
it may even be a good thing.
finally i just bundled all of the variables into a single container object and passed the container around.
think of egyptian hieroglyphics, mayan hieroglyphics, the latin alphabet, the greek alphabet, arabic, chinese ideograms, wonderfully flowingdevanagari देवनागरी, sharp pointy cuneiform wedges, even shorthand.
no handyman could be successful if he relied on a single tool (a hammer, say) for everything that he did.
that means that python hastwo tools for building functions:def and lambda.
rotate the top using the location of the touchpad as the pivot point — that way you will disturb the touchpad cables at little as possible.
and the way to create a workingcopy directory is to run a svn checkout command against the repository on the server.
that means that you don’t need to worry about the glidepoint cables, so you can lift the keyboard top completely off in order to access the programmable chip.
when i was learning python, i of course read the usual warnings.
so i followed my mom’s tongue in cheek advice (“get ‘em before the hoarders do.”) and got more.
it is important to recognize that utf-8 is able to represent any character in the unicode standard.
when i googled for answers to it, i didn’t very much like any of the answers that i found, so i wrote my own.
from this perspective, writing is encoded speech.
so i thought that i would post an example of the technique that i use, in case others might find it useful.
the list is held together by nothing more than a personal gut feel that these books have asomething — a je ne sais quoi — in common.
many of the online tutorials and introductions try to explain how touse subversion without explaining how subversionworks.
python will not become lisp.[3] third lambda is confusing because: lambda is usually described as a tool for creating functions, but a lambda specification does not contain areturn statement.
as our story begins — on a dark and stormy night, of course — we find our protagonist deep in thought.
the use case approach provides no natural mechanism for capturing such mathematical algorithms, business rules, and government regulations.
comments (6) the videos of pycon 2011 at blip.tv are fantastic.
you can just reboot the keyboard without removing the chip, of course, and that will fix the immediate problem.
on the top right-hand side, locate the programmable chip.
in summary, the byte order — the order of the bytes in multi-byte chunks of data — is different on big-endian and little-endian computers.
the runway was wet, and the plane’s wheels were aquaplaning instead of turning.
use svn update to bring your working copy into sync with the latest revision in the repository: basically, what the update command does is to copy the project files from the central repository down to the .svn directory in your workingcopy.
once the events in the lives of the objects have been described, the requirements analyst can approach the task of writing use cases in a systematic fashion, by writing a use case for each of the events.
knowing about aquaplaning, we are tempted to say, is our client’s problem.
unfortunately, python doesn’t have a built-in function, nor do string objects have a built-in method, to do what they will want.
that would be a nice enhancement for wordpress — to allow a reader to collapse and expand a code snippet.
so i’m happy to announce — not the discovery, certainly — the christening of thearguments container pattern, which says, basically: sometimes when you have a lot of individual variables that you need to pass around to a lot of different functions or methods, the best solution is to put them into a container object and just pass the container object around.
the left shift key didn’t work and several pairs of keys seemed to have exchanged places.
it doesn’t depend on the flag keys being one character long — it would work just as well if the length for flag keys was fixed at two or even three characters.
we can split and slice them, concatenate and search inside them.
well, i nearly fell off my chair when bob told me that such a thing actually existed.
they may not see much point in making a big deal about it, or in giving it a name and decking it out with the fancy title of “design pattern”.
the globals class pattern relieves us of of the burden of having to worry about it.
one thing that i learned was that the disk backup utility that i was using at the time did not backup my email files.
so the messages were not recoverable.
i immediately ordered one, tried it out, and loved it.
in a more elaborate version of this technique, you can define a mem class, complete with methods, and make mem an instance of the class.
this was very confusing to an ex-pvcs user.
at this point i’m interested in syntactical issues, so i want to use a semantically neutral vocabulary.
the globals class pattern makes it possible to create multiple, distinct groups of globals.
which means that you should always open a pickle file in binary mode: “wb” to write it, and “rb” to read it.
where moderate consumption might be useful, chocolate tempts us to immoderate consumption.
you figure that you’ll need at least 3 bytes to hold the biggest number on your list.
where the plain text is an image, it can be encoded as a gif, or png, or jpg file.
i (and others, of course) believe that jsd-style specifications are a more useful tool than stds and state machines for specifying many systems.
the first activity in the requirements-gathering process must be the study and description of the problem-environment, the application domain.
but tools get worn and dirty and a few years ago my ultras were terminally filthy and starting to fail.
the anatomy of an evolution keyboard working with evolution keyboards is tricky because the evolutions have the little glidepoint touchpad in the middle of the top of the keyboard.
the files in each administrative directory help subversion recognize which files contain unpublished changes, and which files are out of date with respect to others’ work.
they do not extend indefinitely, and a horizontal scrollbar is not available so that you can scroll as far to the right as you need to.
once we’ve specified exactly what a plain-text representation of a message looks like — a finite sequence of characters from our 30-character alphabet, or perhaps our 75-character alphabet — then we can devise a system (a code) that can reliably encode and decode plain-text messages written in that alphabet.
we can then use those words when we write our descriptions of the functions and use cases that we wish the system to support.
