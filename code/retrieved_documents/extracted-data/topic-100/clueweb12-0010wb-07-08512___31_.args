relational databases are designed for consistency, to support complex transactions that can easily be rolled back if any one of a complex set of operations fails.we are reaching a stage where the great limiting factor to significant progress is our intelligent processing systems, we are beginning to have the data but we don't yet have suitably developed systems to intelligently process that data (both in a human and non-human manner).the value of data analysis and representation critically depends on access to trustworthy source data.data science isn't just about the existence of data, or making guesses about what that data might mean; it's about testing hypotheses and making sure that the conclusions you're drawing from the data are valid.we're increasingly finding data in the wild, and data scientists are involved with gathering data, massaging it into a tractable form, making it tell its story, and presenting that story to others.what differentiates data science from statistics is that data science is a holistic approach.data scientists combine entrepreneurship with patience, the willingness to build data products incrementally, the ability to explore, and the ability to iterate over a solution.machine learning is another essential tool for the data scientist.faster computations make it easier to test different assumptions, different datasets, and different algorithms.as far image data sets are concerned , being multidimensional has a total mathematical basis for its processing and result retrievals.it's easer to consult with clients to figure out whether you're asking the right questions, and it's possible to pursue intriguing possibilities that you'd otherwise have to drop for lack of time.they expose rich apis, and are designed for exploring and understanding the data rather than for traditional analysis and reporting.data science requires skills ranging from traditional computer science to mathematics to art.they share the fact that their principal drivers are forms of pollution from human activities, but they are not the same in their impacts or the actions needed to mitigate them.there was insufficient computing power, the data was all locked up in proprietary sources, and the tools for working with the data were insufficient.
