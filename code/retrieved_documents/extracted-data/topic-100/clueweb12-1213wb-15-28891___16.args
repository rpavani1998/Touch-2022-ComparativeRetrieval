i'll specifically talk about version control, project builds, testing withnose and development practices like code reviews,yagni and agile development.
the presentations are a mixture of lecture and hands-on exercises in a similar style to mynbn courses.
the specific topics will vary based on the needs of the audience.
a lot of chemistry data is passed around as comma-, space-, or tab- separated files.
i've used it in a model calculation system using oechem and other tools to compute descriptor values then passing the code over r to evalute the model.
this course is meant for computational chemists who want to set up an in-house cheminformatics server for specific analysis tasks.
for those just starting off in python, the python beginner's guide contains links to many resources including online tutorials and a list of books.
i'll show a few examples you can build off of and provide pointers of where to get more in-depth information.
my courses are meant for computational chemists who are not programmers but have some programming experience.
python for windows has excellent support for com, which is how windows programs can embed or control other windows programs.
i could teach it, but i don't have as much experience as i do with oechem.
i'll teach the python-specific features as i work through my examples.
i also think that oechem is a better library for most use, if you have the money and consider proprietary software acceptable.
i've used it in a model calculation system using oechem and other tools to compute descriptor values then passing the code over r to evalute the model.
despite the best efforts of some, there's still very little direct influence of xml in computational chemistry.
if you are from an academic or non-profit group then you may qualify for a discount.
i teach both corporate courses and public ones.
the second day covers essential libraries for calling out tocommand-line programs, handling csv files, making plots, and more.
oechem doesn't make that assumption and instead has functions to convert between different chemistry models; you have to call those functions.
new features include easier access to normal shell commands, improved history, support for matplotlib, and better help.
it's full-featured, fast, and powerful, but a bit on the hard side to use.
using com to control excel python for windows has excellent support for com, which is how windows programs can embed or control other windows programs.
i teach training courses in python programming for computational chemistry, with an emphasis on cheminformatics.
ipython enhances the normal interactive python interpreter to make it better for exploratory programming.
i'll show how to use python'ssubprocess module to call them from python.

the first day is anoverview the core python language and oechem.
many chemistry programs are only available through the command line.
it's not hard to write a python program which opens excel, creates a new spreadsheet, loads data into the spreadsheet, and creates a plot of the results.
i've developed a set of chemistry extensions to mysql so you can get some experience in doing chemically-aware queries, like substructure searches and similarity ranking.
if you are building models or doing data mining then you should know about this project.
i'll work through how to use python to parse these sorts of files, with a focus on smiles files.
r includes its own programming language and a number of high-quality analysis packages.
corporate compound databases are often stored in a relational database like oracle.
i've developed a set of chemistry extensions to mysql so you can get some experience in doing chemically-aware queries, like substructure searches and similarity ranking.
i'll describe some of the basic r data type, how to create them from python, how to call the r functions through rpy, and how to understand the r documentation enough to be able to call it from python.
as an example of a difference, openbabel follows the daylight model and assumes that the right behavior is to convert everything into the same chemistry model.
i'll shows some examples of creating a database schema, loading compound data into the database, and searching the data set.
software development best practices software development is more than sitting down and programming.
attendees must have some programming experience (know how to use variables, for-loops, if-statements, and know how to use text editors and command-line tools.
up-to-date information can always be found at http://dalkescientific.com/training/. computational chemists are not programmers, but programming is an essential skill for developing new algorithms, generating data, and analyzing results.
i have taught beginning programming to bioinformatics graduate students.
you might be interested in thetutor mailing list "for folks who want to ask questions regarding how to learn computer programming with the python language."
i have more experience with the oechem way and can explain it better.
you don't need to be corporate is to set up a relational database.
beautifulsoup makes it easier to get access to that data in your programs.
the topics i'll cover are: attendees must have some existing python experience.
beautifulsoup a lot of data is available through web pages designed for people, not software.
it contains an extensivepython programming interface which can be used for structure analysis, movie making, and more.
i'll show some examples of usingelementtree to read and extract fields from an xml file.
most working scientists have little training in programming and end up spending a lot of time figuring out how to parse a file format or work with a software library, rather than figuring out the science.
after all, the library is freely available so anyone can install it without needing a special license.
parsing csv files a lot of chemistry data is passed around as comma-, space-, or tab- separated files.
r is a great software environment for statistical computing and generating plots.

oechem doesn't make that assumption and instead has functions to convert between different chemistry models; you have to call those functions.
the course will be hosted by and invoices sent by the python academy, located at zur schule 20, leipzig.
most of the code will look similar in other languages so it should be easy to follow.

we still use sd and smiles files.

i'll shows some examples of creating a database schema, loading compound data into the database, and searching the data set.
it's not a general purpose language like python and it doesn't include the diversity of modules that python has.
this causes small differences in how the libraries treat conditions like aromaticity.
