its modular structure easily enables parallel computation across different architectures and collaborative code development between different groups.it allows scientists to modify geometric models and interactively change numerical parameters and boundary conditions, as well as to modify the level of mesh adaptation needed for an accurate numerical solution.the s language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and r provides an open source route to participation in that activity.scicraft is an open source data analysis software which solves these problems through an intuitive and user friendly framework where existing methods written in any programming language can easily be combined.it is quite reliable, and has good garbage collection, and no memory leaks.it can be envisioned as a computational workbench, in which a scientist can design and modify simulations interactively via a component-based visual programming model.lush is designed to be used in situations where one would want to combine the flexibility of a high-level, weakly-typed interpreted language, with the efficiency of a strongly-typed, natively-compiled language, and with the easy integration of code written in c, c++, or other languages.it has sophisticated data structures (including lists, polynomials, rational functions, linear systems...), an interpreter and a high level programming language.combining the methods with external software usually requires time-consuming data format and interface handling that hinders the investigator.the class categories include: [ http://root.cern.ch/] many scientific fields experience an enormous increase in produced data and thus need the availability of effective data analysis software.in effect, numerical python is a free alternative to commercial solutions such as matlab with the added bonus of the python language which can be argue to be much better than what can be found in most commercial solution.this makes root a premier platform on which to build data acquisition, simulation and data analysis systems.it provides integration of a large number of methods from multiple sources such that the user does not need to be concered with problems related to data imports/exports, file formats and automation.even though scicraft can communicate in principle with any type of computer language, we have found it useful to concentrate on high level languages that are suited for rapid development of data analysis algorithms.the encapsulation of abstract objects in concrete representations facilitates the process of manipulating these objects symbolically.
