his talk on text analysis was very good as well -slides
i also really enjoyed the talk on genetic algorithms by eric floehr, a fellow who seems to do weather prediction consulting.
some talks were nice surprises, too, kind of the point of going to conferences!
i was there as a data-oriented geek, but i saw ux opportunity everywhere, for the right kinds of ux folks.
based on lunch table happenstance, i ended up going to ablender api talk by chris allan webber, a subject about which i knew zilch.
not all talks were excellent, of course.
my sad female nerd note: i was one of 3 women in the machine learning tutorial.
(the gist being that since a lot of data handling involves discrete steps to clean and transform, you can put these steps into little modules that allow you to view the big picture of what's going on with your data munging.)
i aimed for cloud data and machine learning.
i loved hilary's talk, but was a bit bummed out by the dropbox keynote that featured the social network of "friends of arash" who started that company -- yeah, all men.
this spring i went to pycon in atlanta, since i've been using python more and more for data analysis problems.
i later heard via twitter a guess that there were only 8% women at the conference as a whole, based on t-shirt orders.
other examples: a talk onpypes by eric gaumer included a good reminder that big data problems existed in the search engine space long before other kinds of big data became "hot" to work on.

a final comment for any ux folks reading this: this would've been a great audience for a talk on ui design in open source, or ui design for python ui's.

his french accent was very nice, but i kept mishearing "scikit-learn" as "psychic learn." :-)

his slides and a bunch of other interesting supporting material (including code) are upon his site.

i have big hopes for the evolution ofprocessing.py and nodebox2, two pythonic visualization options, but i am not sure they're there yet for me as a data vis person.
there were a lot of talks on data, big data, cloud data, and scaling python (to handle big data and data problems).
by lynn cherny, ph.d. the initial draw was the tutorials.

another talk on big data that was well-tweeted was c. titus brown's "handling ridiculous amounts of data with probabilistic data structures.

blender is apparently beefing up its api for external calls and automation; as a visualization person, i'm interested in tools that i can "drive" with data as input.
"slides here - probably requires the video to fully interpret this, at least it does for me (yes, i missed this one too).

as a light coder myself, i can't agree more.
