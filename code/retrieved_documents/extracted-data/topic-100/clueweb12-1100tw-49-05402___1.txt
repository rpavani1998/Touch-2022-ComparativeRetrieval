data analysis training march 20, 2012 by prasoonsharma (this article was first published on enterprise software  doesn't have to suck, and kindly contributed to r-bloggers)
exports, surveys, web scraping etc.
summaries,  cross-tabulation - what does knowing one thing tell me about another?
after completion of the course, you will be able to: understand concepts of data science, related processes, tools, techniques  and path to building expertise use unix command line tools for file processing (awk, sort, paste, join,  gunzip, gzip)
class objectives (learning outcomes)
purpose of this discussion is to get you started) e) where to go from here?
data-driven business functions e.g. mroi, mix optimization, ipl teams / fantasy teams, predictions - big data - definition: data sets that no longer fit on a disk, requiring compute clusters and respective software and algorithms (map/reduce running on hadoop).

summarize, visually inspect entire data - what does the data look like?
- real big data problems: parallel computing,  distributed computing, cloud, hadoop, casandra - most analysis isn't big  data.
choose your flavor: e-mail, twitter, rss, or facebook...
r-bloggers r news and tutorials contributed by (320) r bloggers - home - about - add your blog!
explore a new dataset with ease (visualize it, summarize it,
plot charts on a dataset class prerequisites good knowledge of basic statistics (min, max, avg, sd, variance, factors,  quantiles/deciles, etc.)
- familiarity with unix os class topics a) intro to data science - explain data science and its importance.
- visualize data - interact with data (not covered here): bi tools, custom dashboards, other tools (ggobi etc.)
- contact us - rss welcome!
we will use r, a leading open source stats package.
i'm training some of my colleagues on big'ish data analysis this week.
why i started learning data science and picked r curriculum for intro to r (r has steep learning curve.
here you will find daily news and tutorials about r , contributed by over 300 bloggers.
here's how i'm running the class.
familiarity with unix os class topics a) intro to data science explain data science and its importance.
story telling with charts - file handling: unix preferred.
top 7 articles of the week - solving easy problems the hard way - a graphical overview of your mysql database - how to read an excel file (dot xls and dot xlsx) into a data frame with r - visualising f1 telemetry data and plotting latitude and longitude with ggplot map projections in r - useful r snippets - select operations on r data frames - survey in r course taught by thomas lumley at statistics.com sponsors mango-solutions.com zero inflated models and generalized linear mixed models with r. zuur, saveliev, ieno (2012).
the first step when dealing with a new data set needs to be exploratory in nature: what actually is in the data set?
r-bloggers was founded by tal galili, with gratitude to the r community.
is powered by wordpress using a bavotasan.com design.
- archive data (not covered here) c) skills needed for data science - statistics: concepts, approach, techniques - databasing: sql - scripting language: ruby, python - regex - visual design:
would love your ideas to make it better.
awk, gzip, gunzip, paste, sort etc. - office tools: excel (plugins like solver, what if) - statistical tools: r, sas, spss, stata, matlab, etc. - bi tools d) learning r we will pick a tool to learn the concepts of data science.
business apps often deal with datasets that fit in excel/access products: desktop tools (excel (solver, what if), access, sql, spss,  stata, r, sas, programming languages (ruby, python, java) -- stats libs in  these languages, bi tools, etc. b) steps in data science acquire data: "obtaining the data"... databases, log files...

after completion of the course, you will be able to: - understand concepts of data science, related processes, tools, techniques and path to building expertise - use unix command line tools for file processing (awk, sort, paste, join, gunzip, gzip) - use excel to do basic analysis - write and understand r code (data structures, functions, packages, etc.)
books, conferences - analyse your favorite dataset: e.g. cricket data analysis - compete (kaggle) - learn other tools (excel solver, sas etc.)

r-bloggers.com offers daily e-mail updates about r news andtutorials on topics such as: visualization ( ggplot2, boxplots, maps, animation), programming ( rstudio, sweave, latex, sql, eclipse, git, hadoop, web scraping) statistics ( regression, pca, time series, ecdf, trading) and more...

you can subscribe for e-mail updates: and get updates to your facebook: if you are an r blogger yourself you are invited to add your own r content feed to this site ( non-english r bloggers should add themselves- here)
