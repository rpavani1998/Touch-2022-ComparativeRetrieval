for students, open source is important because it makes world-class statistical software available regardless of one’s personal or institutional resources (except for an internet connection).for professionals in my field, open source means that software can be made available simultaneously with new methods that are introduced in professional publications.the method is highly desirable in my work, as databases are updated continually requiring the updating of reports.the result is that new and useful tools can be used immediately for researchers who need them.you'll not only learn how to program in r, but also how to find the right user-contributed r packages for statistical modeling, visualization, and bioinformatics.the beneficiaries are researchers and students who want a practical introduction to the analysis of longitudinal behavioral data.my expertise is applied statistics in the behavioral and medical sciences.my biostatistics team analyzes data from the scientific sections to answer substantive research questions.the software and the data sets can be freely downloaded and all the examples can be reproduced on the reader’s own computer.i am the head statistician for neurobiological predictors of huntington’s disease (predict-hd), funded by the national institutes of health and the chdi foundation, inc.the statistical analysis is performed in a pre-compilation step, and the results are embedded in the tex file, which is compiled to produce the final pdf report.the integrated components allow a program file to have both r and latex syntax interweaved.to the best of my knowledge, this cannot be performed in commercial software packages, as there is little or no cooperation.commercial software was a concern because of its cost and availability, and i turned to the open source r system for statistical computing and graphics ( http://www.r-project.org/).i learned many tips and tricks along the way that have increased efficiency in my daily professional work.
