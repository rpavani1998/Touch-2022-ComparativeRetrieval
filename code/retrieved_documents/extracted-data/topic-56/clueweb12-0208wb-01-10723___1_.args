the masai mara holds some of the largest concentrations of animals in the world, especially in august when huge herds of white-bearded wildebeest and burchell's zebra, pursued by their attendant predators, migrate into the reserve from the adjacent serengeti.it is cut by only two permanent rivers and so has a more arid feel to it than the other reserves we will be visiting on the holiday, but is nevertheless a wonderful area for mammals, birds and other wildlife.nakuru is one of the better places in africa to find leopard and the park is also a very important rhino sanctuary.the park is a wonderfully atmospheric place, where you can really enjoy the sights and sounds of the rift valley in a classic bush setting.the decline of the eastern black rhinoceros has been both rapid and shocking and, not too long ago, there was a real fear that this amazing animal may become extinct.tsavo west, when combined with tsavo east, covers over 20,000 square kilometers creating one of africa's largest conservation areas.birdlife is once again abundant and we will no doubt find a wide selection of the 400 species that have been recorded here.this is a luxury tented camps and lodge safari, and therefore suitable for anyone of any age, without any great necessity for extreme fitness.predators such as cheetah and lion do occur in amboseli but are somewhat wary as they are still persecuted by the surrounding farmers.this is a luxury tented camps based safari, covering all aspects of general wildlife including watching both mammals and birds but with more emphasis on wildlife.it has a population of over 60 black rhino, although these are very hard to see, and a healthy breeding population of white rhino which includes a large number of young animals.friendlier inhabitants, however, include a wealth of birdlife - an amazing 600 species have been recorded here - including ostrich, kori bustard, saddle-billed stork, black-breasted snake-eagle, magpie shrike, carmine bee-eater, woodland kingfisher, scarlet-chested sunbird and many many more.its acacia-dotted plains and dry rolling grasslands support a wealth of game including plenty of elephant, masai giraffe, burchell's zebra, cape buffalo and waterbuck.today ngulia sanctuary covers 38 square miles (62 square kilometres) and is home to 57 rhino, more than half of which were born there.there are additional activities on offer for those who wish, the most popular being a hot air balloon ride or a masai village visit, a truly magical experience.
