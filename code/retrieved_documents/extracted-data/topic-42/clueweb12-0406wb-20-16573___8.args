ford brought in its new f-150s, toyota tundras, chevy silverados and dodge rams, setting up test tracks where drivers could compare the trucks one-on-one in different conditions.
ford engineers designed the rear cab floor without a center hump, making it possible for inside cargo to sit flat against the floor.
six-way power seats, tilt steering and height-adjustable pedals allow a person of any size to drive the truck with no obstructions.
the f-150's console is large enough to hold a laptop and file folders, and a large glove box and door panel storage pockets add even more storage.
cup holders will accept full-size drinks.
pedals allow a person of any size to drive the truck with no obstructions.
another helpful option is the tailgate step, which folds out from the tailgate and makes it easy to get up into the bed (a flip-up grab bar is included to keep you steady).
my truck was equipped with navigation -- the system shares a screen with sirius satellite radio and the truck's sync voice control.

the 5.4 is a strong running engine with plenty of power for most any needs.
ford moved the new truck's b-pillar back by 6-inches to improve side visibility.
i'd driven, so i'll mention some handy options you'll find on other trim levels.
pickup truck © dale wickell more images (3) where i live, it's difficult to test new trucks on snowy roads, because our wintry precipitation usually only sticks around a couple of hours.
although the f-150's front end appears to be squared-off, the truck actually has a lower drag coefficient than its predecessors (a new tailgate with a spoiler-like top is part of the package that improve aerodynamics).
so i couldn't pass up an opportunity to test drive the 2009 f-150 during a dead-of-winter trip to detroit.
four-wheel drive and advance trac with roll stability control each got a good workout while driving the truck in detroit's heavy snow, and both performed flawlessly.
when not in use, the step folds neatly into the tailgate liner, where it doesn't interfere with cargo.
a large rear window and oversize outside mirrors remove all traces of a blind spot.
trucks © dale wickell i've driven the 2009 ford f-150 several times under different conditions, and remain impressed with its capabilities.
you'll find comparisons and more driving impressions in the 2009 f-150 first drive article written after that event.

i'd driven, so i'll mention some handy options you'll find on other trim levels.
on the road in the f-150 pickup truck the 4x4 test truck was equipped with a 5.4 liter v-8 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission.
although the f-150's front end appears to be squared-off, the truck actually has a lower drag coefficient than its predecessors (a new tailgate with a spoiler-like top is part of the package that improve aerodynamics).
leather can be pretty cold on a winter morning, so i turned on the seat heater while i cleaned the snow off of the windows, and by the time i finished, the seats were toasty.
the current offering of pickups from all manufactures is the best it has been in years, but if i were going to buy a new truck today, it would probably be an f-150.
and if you don't like the looks of running boards, no problem, because you only see them when the door is open.
i tested quick take-offs in an empty parking lot, and also turned the wheels while braking hard -- anti-lock brakes, traction control, roll stability and other systems did their jobs.

it was snowing hard (with no signs of letting up) when the truck was delivered, turning my black f-150 supercab xlt 4x4 into a "snow" white and "slush" gray machine.
like the platinum edition'spower retractable running boards -- pretty much a necessity for getting in and out of today's taller trucks.
four-wheel drive and advance trac with roll stability control each got a good workout while driving the truck in detroit's heavy snow, and both performed flawlessly.
the transmission can be operated manually (like i did in deep snow), or put into "drive" when you don't want or need to fool around with shifting (when the selector is in "drive," you'll find that shifts are smooth and predictable).

i was always confident that the truck would go where i wanted it to go and stop without sliding out of control.

i sure didn't test the cooling feature on this trip, but it was a big help during a warm-weather drive.

gauges are large and situated for unobstructed display through the steering wheel, and the truck's center stack puts hvac controls within easy reach.
the f-150 is quieter than ever before inside, and new steering bushings and dampers eliminate all engine vibrations in the steering wheel when the truck is sitting at idle.
i was always confident that the truck would go where i wanted it to go and stop without sliding out of control.
in fact, the new f-150 looks a whole lot like a super duty truck.
the 6-speed automatic is new for 2009, and a much needed addition that helped improve fuel mileage and made it easier to tow and pull hills with a load.
you might not need all of those systems at once on a typical drive, but if you do, they could prevent an accident.
winter weather continued on and off for several days, eliminating any chance of high speed driving and making my time in the truck all about a test of traction control and abs.

at first glance, the most obvious part of the new design might be the 2009 f-150's large chrome grille and headlight trim, which give the truck a more massive appearance than pickups from the previous generation.
