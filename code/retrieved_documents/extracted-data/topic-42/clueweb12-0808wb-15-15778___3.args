besides the timing belt and water pump, the only other things that have needed to be fixed since my father bought it in `99 are the starter @145,000 and overdrive & torque converter @ 138,000.
i only own a little 1998 v-6 dakota, but with it ive hauled more pounds then 90% of toyota tundra owners ever will.
american trucks can stand up to any truck made anywhere.
have we all forgotten  that  competition is to obtain a better product and introduce variety.. do we see everything as a us  vs  them(ie foreign) issue... despite  the fact  that  toyota employs many americans and   treats them better desperate people say and do , the expected.. finally, before ford redesigned the f 150,  it was notoriously a  failure in crash tests, the  old generation tundra might not have had the looks but it always scored better in crash tests.
it couldn't even support the weight.
but what gets me is the face that i need a bigger truck from the loads i carry but this little thing handles it just fine, then i see some *** in a big bad toyota tundra with a bed that he polishes every week (whoever polished their bed should throw thier truck away).
it adds nothing and takes away from functionality.
ford/gm/dodge have no where near as much problems as the truck.
it adds nothing and takes away from functionality.
do i wish they were all built here, yes, but the money spent on these trucks goes to american companies, not a japanese company.
it`s not good for the skilled american craftsman that build it.
i just had the 3rd timing belt put in, along with a new water pump.
the front end was always way too soft for my liking, especially with 500 lbs or more in the back..
keep sending your money to japan brother, they appreciate it.
so i installed firestone ride rite airbags in the back before the truck was 2 years old.
the dealer said the tundra crew cab doesn't come with a bench in the front.
they will never build them in indiana again, they are taking out the line due to poor sales.

doubt i will.. bottom line is: there is a lot of people who do not like the tundra, most of them don`t have a leg to stand on because they have never owned one or drove one for 200,000 trouble free miles.
also toyota trucks have umm..
the front end was always way too soft for my liking, especially with 500 lbs or more in the back..
as far as i`m concerned, i would love a pearl harbor edition tundra, bullet holes n` all.
i also owned a t-100 way back in the day before the chevy.
so the third passenger sits up in the middle.
and when i send it off to scrap, i`ll be right back at the toyota dealer buying another tundra.
a center console in a truck is a complete waste of space.
my last bass boat was rigged on the showroom floor with a yamaha motor.

thats why you bought your dodge that was made by skilled mexican workers.
they have idled the texas plant due to poor sales, but will re-start it when they get rid of excess inventory.
the titan had an engine/transmission combination that put a lot of power to the pavement, and while the ride was a bit harsh it, again, did what was expected of it.
my mileage in all of my trucks has ranged from 16 mpg to 20 mpg, depending on what i was doing on any given tank.
this is our country, these are our trucks, gm, ford, dodge.
do i wish they were all built here, yes, but the money spent on these trucks goes to american companies, not a japanese company.
it did not extend to all trucks only a handful..out of hundreds and thousands..

i just prefer doing business with a company that is american.
and to the guy who says his tundra is faster then any other truck i say this, trucks are geared lower to be able to haul larger loads with smaller engines, (my dakota will accelerate the exact same with an air commpresser and tool box in the bed as it will empty, even though that acceleration is not that great)
i just want to agree with the guy on the previous page, the one who said that the toyotas just cant stand up to the day to day hauling and work that a truck needs to.
other then the truck being powerful and quick, the chassis/fit and finish/quality aren't on par with other trucks.
the pickup market in general is not good due to gas prices.
ford/gm/dodge have no where near as much problems as the truck.
i also owned a t-100 way back in the day before the chevy.

listen to yourself... you must be one of the many that.deny anything that makes them feel threatened..
most in my town who the truck have had their tail-gate fall off.
doubt i will.. bottom line is: there is a lot of people who do not like the tundra, most of them don`t have a leg to stand on because they have never owned one or drove one for 200,000 trouble free miles.
they used to build tundras in indiana, not anymore, the texas tundra plant is shut down at this time.

if you go over bumps, you can watch the bed flex (which is probably the reason for the recall on the tail-lights since they were cracking).
this is our country, these are our trucks.
all three were great trucks, honestly.
as far as owning/driving foreign vehicles... my wife is a toyota lover.
that`s the maintenance record so far, besides oil changes, 2 sets of spark plugs, numerous trans services (every 25,000), 4 sets of shocks, 1 set of sway bar links and poly bushings up front, 3 sets of rotors & pads, the drums & shoes are original.

thats why we export jobs , u think your american corporations give a hoot that your a poor american begging that they give u a job...
i want you to understand i do not think a toyota is a bad vehicle.
honestly i think that for light duty any of the trucks in that class will not out right fail in their role.
then you have the “real” americans that just have to “buy american” because buying an american car is good for america..
(plus benches are great for the little lady when she wants to get closer to me on a long drive home)
when i bought my chevy i had not been impressed with the dodge (did test drive one) but i hear the previous generation (to the current coming out) was quite good.
all of her cars have been toyotas... and she drives them to the ground.
because it has potential and is quite a success.
the 5.7 is a much efficient and better designed engine with tech , compared to the domestics which use ohv designs..
so americans are paid to build them.
don't run that bs on me son, i have been working trucks hard on a pipeline right of way for 30 years.
where as all full-size trucks are now on a fully boxed frame, the toyota still runs on a c-channel setup.
(plus benches are great for the little lady when she wants to get closer to me on a long drive home)
u talk like the usa can live like a island..
i drive a 2000 tundra sr5 4x2 v-8 with 189,000 miles on the clock.
this is our country, these are our trucks, gm,ford,dodge.
myself, i will do business with companies that are american and keep the money i spend at home.
its not that toyota would knowingly put in a weak camshaft in..same with other things..

my f-150 has a good ride, decent power (5.4), handles well despite feeling like a tank.
but when u say ur tundra is so fast, its because they put a higher geared transmission in it and it has speed yes, but it needs that larger engine to produce the same power as the smaller engined equivalents, therefore more gas, and an overworked engine.
yea i just want to agree with the guy on the previous page, the one who said that the toyotas just cant stand up to the day to day hauling and work that a truck needs to.

i told the dealer i will take the boat, but i want a mercury motor on it.
a yamaha is a good engine, but so is a mercury and they are an american company.

maybe they don`t have a leg to stand on because they lost it in pearl harbor, either way, i`m going to run my tundra into the ground.
i found a deal in performance products on a set of h&r progressive springs and 4 bilstein 5100 shock absorbers.. had them put on @ 184,000 miles.
i don't know more power, more torque,and can tow more.

toyota actually pays the american worker, instead of using cheap labor.
but when u say ur tundra is so fast, its because they put a higher geared transmission in it and it has speed yes, but it needs that larger engine to produce the same power as the smaller engined equivalents, therefore more gas, and an overworked engine.
they build f series trucks in louisville, ky. norfork, va dearborn, mi, kansas city, mo. and mexico gm trucks are built in flint, mi.
i believe we are in debt as a nation about 9 1/2 trillion dollars right now, most of it owed to japan and china, so keep sending them money and hurting american companies if it makes you feel good.
fort wayne in, pontiac, mi, canada and mexico dodge builds pickups in fenton mo,warren mi and mexico.
my personal preference of the three is the ford simply because it really is built to take a beating, not to drag race.
as far as i`m concerned, i would love a pearl harbor edition tundra, bullet holes n` all.
to many americans, that makes a difference, to some it doesn't, they feel good about giving their money to a foreign company.
many a time i had the bed full and and had to stick stuff in the back with the seats up.
then you have the “real” americans that just have to “buy american” because buying an american car is good for america..
it just makes no sence to have a truck with so mush power and not use half of it.
it did not  extend to all trucks only a handful..out of hundreds and thousands..

im an american truck buyer, not because i am "loyal to the american bussiness" but becasue they make a product that will last for the long haul, not some vanity truck, that "rides nice" and "looks pretty on the inside" thats girl talk post reply new user | posts: 47 | joined: 08/08 posted: 09/30/08 08:04 am american trucks can stand up to any truck built anywhere.

where as all full-size trucks are now on a fully boxed frame, the toyota still runs on a c-channel setup.
what do you expect ,in fact  the sheer negetivity is really a sign of  nervousness in some circles of its potential.
i had no complaints with any of them.
a  they  go where its to their advantage, u just  cant  stand  someone  benefiting...

(the reason for only od & tq converter is my trans guy said the other 3 gears were “like new”).
anyway, i just think that none of the trucks are junk and will all serve their purpose.
my f-150 has a good ride, decent power (5.4), handles well despite feeling like a tank.
the interior in my opinion is the ugliest thing out there, and the quality of the truck is just plain bad.
from the factory, the suspension was a little lacking i thought..
dodge makes a 5.7 liter hemi, toyota makes a 5.7 liter that outperforms it and gets better gas mileage..
the chevy was a great all around truck, did what it was asked altho' the payload capacity was not all that great.
i find the styling inside and out to be just plan ugly.

now i would admit, the older tundras (previous generation) are well built all round but the new tundras are just plain terrible compared to the older ones, not to mention
