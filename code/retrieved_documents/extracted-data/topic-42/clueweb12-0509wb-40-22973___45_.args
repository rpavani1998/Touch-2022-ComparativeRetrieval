pricing is not yet announced, but trimming the cost obviously will give ford the ability to aim for affordability and profitability.it’s a kind of inferiority complex that pushes them to produce ultra-hip, spectacularly innovative, or screaming fast electric vehicles—and to brand them as revolutionary—even though it drives the cost up and out of range for most consumers.focus ev had enough torque to spin it's inside front wheel when accelerating through turns and provide ample power for brisk acceleration.the new ford focus electric car promises to travel 100 miles per charge from its lithium-ion battery pack, whose technology is several thousand dollars more expensive than its traditional gas propulsion system.by choosing an existing platform, ford will save the expense associated with developing a unique design.in the greater toronto area there are well over 5 million people within 50km of work, km making up a lot less miles means everyone is a potential customer for being able to buy this car to get to work everyday and manage to not encounter energy problems.now i'm ready to give ford another chance, provided their ev is well-engineered and they price it realistically.in other words, ford is using a system already developed by magna international, a major global auto supply and technology firm, which has been looking for a carmaker to use its new pre-packaged electric car architecture, including motor, transmission, motor controller, lithium ion battery system and charger.despite the low per mile cost of energy for an ev, any cost savings vs. gasoline will likely be eaten up when you replace the battery pack every 6-10 years or so.the implications of this vehicle could be pretty far-reaching, if they can get it to market at a price people will pay.if the price comes in below $25k i can see a lot of commuters (like me) taking advantage of the fuel cost savings.if the lifetime cost of "fuel" is included, the electric car has a huge advantage, but we don't see that at up front when we are making the decision.in fact, ford is encouraging magna to spread the high-tech love, because magna’s success with ev technology will increase the chances that other car companies will help defray costs.it was produced in 1998 and is still running great with no maintenance except new tires.time will tell but effort is needed to make it actually happen if we are going to have a future standard of living like that which we enjoy today.
