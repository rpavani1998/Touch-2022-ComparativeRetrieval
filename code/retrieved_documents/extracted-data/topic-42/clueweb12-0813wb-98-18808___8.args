the giant in this field is now the ecoboost-powered f-150, which, with the right gearing can tow 11,300 pounds behind any cab configuration.

it comes with a 6-speed automatic.
a work truck package ($195 credit) comes with a blacked-out grille and bumpers and heavy-duty vinyl seats.

very impressive is the absence of any discernible surge sometimes associated with overhead-cam, multi-valve engines.
interestingly, gaps between body panels are deliberately wider than contemporary robotic assembly might allow.
with the seats folded for cargo, the double cab has a significantly lower load height, which should make it easier for canines to get in and out.
a similarly configured ram hemi can just edge past that (towing 10,450 pounds), whereas gm crew cabs tend to have the advantage in that division (at 10,600 max), and the nissan titan (which offers no regular cab) stays near 9,500 max.
the rearview camera is handy when parallel parking, easing and speeding the task.
they can be adjusted to cover all blind spots.
it's 270 hp, about 30 hp shy of ford's more economical 3.7-liter v6, but the toyota v6 doesn't need to be revved to 6500 rpm and torque is equal at 278 pound-feet.

based on towing a variety of trailers from sea level to 5,000 feet, we're here to tell you the tundra 5.7-liter has more than enough pulling power and appropriate gearing.

the rearview camera is valuable for spotting shorter obstacles when backing up because the top of the tailgate towers well above the height of small children, making it an important safety feature.

the fabric upholstery feels durable and the leather does, too.
in the double cab, two more cup holders fold out of the backside of the front-seat center section, while in the crewmax, there are two more still in the rear seat's fold-down center armrest.
