i changed my mind about this car.
the 2014 model offers full-speed-range adaptive cruise control that can come to a complete stop and accelerate again depending on traffic movement in front of the vehicle.
i  thought the 2.5l replaces it in a few months.
impala's shouldn't have 4 cylinders, it just is too small for a car that size.
i at least had hope...a front wheel drive impala only conveys to the suspense-held public what everyone feared; that absolutely nothing has changed.
throttleblip - 04/03/12 11:24 pm
it's still america's bread-n-butter sedan, and has been for decades.
gm’s collision mitigation braking system – another chevy first – can apply the brakes automatically if a crash is imminent.
current car tops out around $31k or so.
i  dont care how many current impalas are sold to rental agencies, this one looks  good.
wrong nothing like  it, the passat even more wrong a cc at best closest resembles this.

rangeroller - 04/04/12 07:38
kinda like the design.
just happy usa back  in the game go gm and ford!
pm think it has been improved and agree some of the design is busy.
but the ride will say more.
at  first i thought wow nice than i thought, again not the car i was hoping it  would turn out to be not edgey enough.
i hope it does'nt have the cave type of appearance of the lacrosse in person and that if in the drivers seat one has good visiblility all around.
i  think gm has created another huge improvement in its line up.
looks like it should be  rwd.
and congrats to gm for leaving out the fake wood on this model.
and we have just been told that front end was for the trucks....

inyurahsya - 04/04/12 12:08 pm it looks like a 4-door camaro with the  rear of a cruze.
dmadam - yesterday  08:33 am until they go rear wheel drive its just another failed gm  imitation of what it used to be.
this car is going to be much more  expensive with all the bells and whistles and its brand new.
i give it an exuberant... 'meh.'
sleeper91tsi - 04/04/12 01:24
i do however wonder what the advantage of eassist is when the normal 4-banger will produce more hp and similar fuel economy numbers in the real world.
someone mentioned the azera- the hyundai is attractive but still derivative of existing asian luxury cars.
it just doesn't work - some colors make this thing look profoundly cheap.
oh what a brave new world. bowery01 - yesterday 07:21 pm what is up with the curly q over the back wheel?
i see this as being a huge sales success soon after hitting the market.
where as the split grill will be for the more “economical” vehicles.
i believe the taurus, avalon, cc, and maxima compete with the  impala.
dmadam - yesterday 08:33 am until they go rear wheel drive its just another failed gm imitation of what it used to be.
unfortunately, we'll see a flood of these on the roads as soon as gm pumps budget & hertz rental fleets full of these.
i doubt a super sport model will offered either.
lasvegascolonel - 04/04/12 12:35 pm having lived through the great impalas that were large cars, v8s, stylish, coupes, and breathtaking in many ways, i wouldn't normally praise these kid hauler impalas (sedans), but this is nicely styled and i would consider this over a more bland camry or accord.
to be honest, full sized sedans should not have such weak  power-trains to began with in 2012.
ejd1984 - 04/04/12 08:14 am it looks great!
inyurahsya - 04/04/12 12:08 pm it looks like a 4-door camaro with the rear of a cruze.
g.m. used to have brilliant styling....lets have some of it back!
the exterior is attractive, the interior offers more than any of its competitors, and that is all it will take to attract buyers.
its a huge step up in the styling dept from the  invisible 9th gen impala but whats with the 3 creases in the rear door?!
old hyundai front, current sides and back.
this thing is all its own your brain is  lying to you side by side pictures of what youre saying it looks like and youll  feel stupid capitals - 04/04/12 01:46 pm overall a nice car  inside/outside, but the four cylinders, i don't know maybe the turbo with 270hp  will be okay in this car.
a hodgepodge of gm designs.
a little more "oomph" (30+hp and lots of torque) from the electric motor would be nice though in such a large car.
the rest looks pretty good and it's definitely different.
i liked it in pictures but in person it looked terrible.
those direct-injection engines include a 2.4-liter i-4 with eassist mild hybrid technology, estimated to produce 182 hp and 172 lb-ft of torque; a 2.5-liter ecotec i-4 estimated at 195 hp and 187 lb-ft; and the familiar 3.6-liter v-6 producing 303 hp and 264 lb-ft.
it looks like they glued doilies randomly all over it.
oh what a brave new world. bowery01 -  yesterday 07:21 pm what is up with the curly q over the back wheel?
i mean hello they did a great job making the camaro!
whoever thinks  this is ugly has no clue what they are talking about.
the steering wheel in that car  was gorgeous (imo).
am not a bad looking car inside and out, but mostly targeted at the rentals, and  the ford taurus and avalons of the world.
a nice thick, leather wrapped wheel with a simple three spoke design and tasteful metal accenting.
that said, i think for what this car is intended to be, it executes it quite well.
the new acadia has a steering wheel  from 1990, as does the traverse, escalade etc.
pm would be far better it came with a v-8 and rear drive.
cp_09malibuv6 - 04/04/12 07:15 am i like how this design wont overshadow the handsome new malibu, the way the new malibu makes the cruze look cheaper by comparison.
ejd1984 - yesterday 09:58
psycowboy - 04/04/12 03:21
aeroknight29 - 04/04/12 08:33
the interior looks  great and the front end is ok but the rear door just looks awful.
nick099 - today 06:49 am the car's underpinnings are lackluster to say the least.
nicombobula -  04/04/12 02:12 pm people this does not look like an azera!!!
i like the azera's design better.
those are probably the closest, though they're rwd.
i would have left the instrument cluster hood the same color as the rest of the dash, but other than those two things, this car looks great.
wrong nothing like it, the passat even more wrong a cc at best closest resembles this.
am it's a huge improvement over the current impala, but the 2013 ford fusion still looks better.
it would be even better if it was rwd.
upgrayedd -  yesterday 12:37
appears to be a huge leap forward from the  "current" model.
niether car looks bad but this just  seems more masculine and american looking.
the long, raked-back profile is meant to pay homage to past impalas, while still providing a contemporary look.
plus, gm's powertrain warranty matches  chrysler's...better than ford or toyota.
glad they kept a v6 option for a while longer.
veritas_aequitas - 04/02/12 01:52
although i do suspect that chevy will raise the price some on this car, i hope they don't raise it too much.
and i can only assume they will offer an upcoming  twin-turbo v6 when ready, the lesser one i assume would be enough.
i really think the designers of this slept with the designers of the new avalon ( and, maybe the azera, as well)
i doubt a super sport model will  offered either.
am i hope the rear is not some iteration  of the camaro rear.
those numbers are up slightly from the 3.6-liter engine in the current impala, which produces 300 hp and 262 lb-ft.
the cafe regs are making cars lame again like they did in the late 1970's.
i can't help but notice how much it looks like the current azera though.. almost like they had the azera on hand when they were designing this car.
and what's with that dash pad?
gm should have re-badged the pontiac g8 (australian muscle car) for the impala replacement.
upgrayedd - yesterday 12:37
like the side profile
nicombobula - 04/04/12 02:12 pm people this does not look like an azera!!!
the v6s are what people buy anyway, not the hemi  models.
lakeshore026 - yesterday 03:34
seriously looking into replacing  her malibu with an impala instead of the new malibu.
looks like some kind of california ghetto carpeted dash cover you buy from jc whitney for $39.
gm could have done a better job on the dash pad, it appears to be an  afterthought.
look at  compeitors like the taurus and the passat.
front-wheel drive is for  bargain, commuter cars, nothing more.
great  combination for the road warriors that want good comfortable reliable  transportation with some power.
nick099 - today 06:49 am the car's underpinnings are  lackluster to say the least.
am i can't wait for the 2014 chevrolet impala, this should be a fantastic car.
the  rest looks pretty good and it's definitely different.
am i stopped reading once i got to "the car will be offered exclusively in front-wheel drive..." wake me up from this nightmare when gm decides to make it rwd.
even more comforting than the design is the fact that the malibu and impala finally do not overlap.
either way the impala looks good, the interior in the 9th generation was horrible, the 8th gen was better.
gm  should have re-badged the pontiac g8 (australian muscle car) for the impala  replacement.
ya'll must be blind.
syj -  04/04/12 12:23 pm reading through the comments you can see who is being  realistic and honest and who is offering mindless impala bashing.
i just read on another website that awd will not be offered on the impala.
a rwd car would of sealed the deal.
the people  who buy this car not only do not care if it is fwd, rwd, or awd, they likely do  not know the difference.
lay off the sauce name  one car in this segment that has a more masculine front end.
golf clap for chevy.... bhallais - 04/04/12 06:21
start by receiving a no-hassle quote for auto insurance.
it's a great looking car.
am and please tell me why this is not a direct  competitor with the malibu.
so we now have a chevy cc, i  understand the v6 and the semi-hyrbrid, but wtf is with that normal 2.5?
fwd and sick, wheezy  little engines tugging around 2 tons of flab.
it wont be compared to midsizers.
what's with the freaky-deaky hood?
it would be great if an ss version with a strong v-8 would also be offered  in the future.
ejd1984  - 04/04/12 08:14
i like a lot of what i see, but that rear quarter just  doesn't work !!
throttleblip -  04/03/12 11:24 pm kinda like the design.
it does look more like a buick-wannabe or hyundai than a chevy, but lately, that's been a good thing.
i'm still not a fan of chevy tan and brown interiors and  their tacky "ambient lighting" but i'd say that the avalon and azera  has their work cut out for them.
nah, it's interior doesn't look as good.
the regular 2.4l is being  phased out.
taurus, 300, charger, azera,  avalon?
35mpg is good though for such a large car.
looks pretty sharp, and that  interior seems pretty fantastic.
looks like it should be rwd.
jackal119 - 04/04/12 05:13
notalwaysbeengood - 04/04/12 09:06 am better looking than the last car by a country mile, but i find the side sculpting too busy, and the same with the interior.
auto loan quote want to save money on your next auto purchase?
major props to the  design team both in and out.
looks so much better than the previous model.
am since when did gm figure out that it's okay to make an  attractive impala?
appears to be a huge leap forward from the "current" model.
92vectra1.6i - 04/04/12 03:36
see how much you can save!
again chevy is making the impala to compete and not dominate.
anyways, i hope they do not do that to the impala... seano0 - 04/01/12 07:50 pm it would be huge for gm to offer this in awd.
since an ss would need the (developing) 3.6l twin-turbo, and  awd to handle the power.
himoses - 04/04/12 06:02 pm people think this looks like an azera?
i can't think of any non-gm car in this class that looks this good:
jgf1031 - 04/04/12 04:35
i believe styling is behind 2013 malibu just like taurus is behind 2013 fusion.
the hood gets a slight power bulge, intended to convey a look of performance.
to be honest, full sized sedans should not have such weak power-trains to began with in 2012.
huge improvement, i must say.
the  curves and bulging fenders are a long way from the old slab-sided design  language.
once i got to "the car will be offered exclusively in front-wheel  drive..." wake me up from this nightmare when gm decides to make  it rwd.
someone mentioned the azera- the hyundai is attractive but still  derivative of existing asian luxury cars.
pm would be far better it came  with a v-8 and rear drive.
am is it me or does the rear 3/4 view looks exactly like that of the hyundai sonata pennrck22 - 04/04/12 09:46
but this looks way more manly than a 300, avalon, taurus, or maxima ryandarr1979 - 04/04/12 03:58
even more comforting than the design is  the fact that the malibu and impala finally do not overlap.
those complaining about rwd, wakeup and read!!
it's still a pretty  vanilla-looking car (not really a deal-killer considering how bland its closest  competitors all look), but i admit it looks gorgeous when compared to the  outgoing impala.
although the photos  depict a loaded ltz, it looks as though chevy may have gotten this one right  for a change.
psycowboy -  04/04/12 03:21
wheres the originality!?
rwd would be sweet nicombobula - 04/04/12 08:22
the impala now comes standard with 18-inch wheels (steel or alloy, depending on trim), with 19- and 20-inch alloys available.
am nice new toyota, you guys at g.m.!
those headlamps feature hids on the ltz model, along with led daytime running lights.
it could have been a good competitor for the 300/charger.

other safety features include forward collision alert, lane departure warning, side blind zone alert, and rear cross traffic alert, which use either radar or cameras to detect various hazards and alert the driver.
whoever thinks this is ugly has no clue what they are talking about.
i think it looks nicer on the outside than the taurus, but comes short of the azera on the inside and out.
astnmrtn007 - 04/04/12 07:42
this thing will be just like the ecoboost exploder.
skyguy - 04/04/12 11:01
glad that they kept the 3.6ltr.
a little more "oomph" (30+hp and lots of torque) from the  electric motor would be nice though in such a large car.
i wasn't expecting anything this nice.
notalwaysbeengood - 04/04/12 09:06 am better looking than the last car by  a country mile, but i find the side sculpting too busy, and the same with the  interior.
i hope chevy comes out with an awd version, that would be pretty  cool.
it looks like they glued doilies  randomly all over it.
i think it is the best looking front wheel drive sedan under  40.
the new impala has some mighty big shoes to fill, and will very likely be the best fwd impala yet.
too bad it's "exclusively fwd.
am this car will have the 2.5l and the e-assist system.
cause you may as well say the same about the  accord too if youre gonna say that.
i don't love it, but it looks decent.
great lines, great details, great  wheels.
but this  looks way more manly than a 300, avalon, taurus, or maxima ryandarr1979 -  04/04/12 03:58
just happy usa back in the game go gm and ford!
this thing will be just like the ecoboost  exploder.
i'm not a fan of the looks like it should have been on a 2nd gen. hhr rear quarter, but otherwise this is huge improvement styling wise over any post '72 impala.
this much improved interior and new found style should increase retail customer percentage.
2.5 good for  malibu, bad for impala.
for sure, it's  nothing like the real impalas that were large, held six adults, v8s, coupes,  and stylish from years ago, but for a family that needs 4 doors to cart people  around, it should do ok.
the 10th-generation impala is based on a stretched version of gm’s epsilon ii platform, which also underpins the cadillac xts and buick lacrosse.
this isnt being designed as a rental car first.
this car is great and its a huge step forward for the impala and its one step closer to greatness.
i hope it does'nt have the cave type of appearance of the lacrosse in  person and that if in the drivers seat one has good visiblility all around.
on top of that, none of the three cars have the exact same powertrains choices.

seriously looking into replacing her malibu with an impala instead of the new malibu.
im thinking a loaded ltz will be around $38k.
one of the previous impala’s biggest trouble spots was its low-rent interior.
am @psycowboy: badge engineering?
it almost seems to me that chevrolet might be creating a two-tier lineup.
a long greenhouse area accentuates the impala’s sleek profile, and finally comes to a point at the rear quarter window, which terminates right before the impala emblem on the rear panel.
and the price will likely move closer to $30k to start.

malibu uses the 2.4l only  because the 2.5l was not yet ready, but next year all malibus will use the  2.5l, so why not the impala in 2013?
seva25 - 04/04/12 10:18

pm this is the best fwd impala yet, and as far as being reliable, efficient transportation, is the best impala ever.
redvette77 - 04/04/12 03:26 pm everyone seems to be missing the same thing.
the steering wheel looks like the ones in some mercedes, two:  it's not a rwd.
i just am disappointed in the rear again.
gm says the system’s appearance in the 2014 impala will mark its first use in a chevy model.
i'd take a new fusion any day over this.
or even the v6 charger (a stretch, but at least the impala could be mentioned in the same breath, unlike if it's fwd only).
i liked it in  pictures but in person it looked terrible.
is this car is designed by a designer who works for kia/ hyundai and who is impressed by audi a7 rear end?
audi, bmw, benz all higher class cars so they don't really  compare...
and how about that dashboard?
i  see this as being a huge sales success soon after hitting the market.
but this looks much more expensive than it will be.
and i can only assume they will offer an upcoming twin-turbo v6 when ready, the lesser one i assume would be enough.
the steering wheel in that car was gorgeous (imo).
all our car data at your fingertips.
i haven't heard of that being a widespread issue, but i would hope for better materials and build quality.

4 cylinder engines in large cars are not a  good idea, not matter how stressed you make them.
gm is addressing that issue in the new model by employing high-quality fabrics, ultrasuede, and perforated leather inside the cabin of the 2014 impala.
so there you have it: a wonderfully styled  car...

this doesnt offer awd and it offers the 2.5l. lacrosse doesnt offer the 2.5 and offers awd.
however, i would think the price will undercut the azera.

so there you have it: a wonderfully styled car...
am @connermt the fusion, accord, camry, passat, and altima are not in the impala's class,they compete with the malibu.
nope, can't think of another non-gm car in this class that looks  this good.
looks like a cheap korean  ripoff of a toyota camry - the interior is more mishmash of design disasters  from government motors - nothing works together - colors don't coordinate -  textures are horrible - the exterior has a mishmash of dents, creases, and  concepts.
04:44 am if 12.9 seconds through a quarter mile (the best time to date for my  corvette 327 powered impala) doesn't qualify as fast, i'd hate to see what  does.

fwd not a bother since  itll be the wifes car..
i just dont think that moter will have the power to pull this car around, they might want to add a blower to that motor to make it relevent.
weird to keep the 2.4l around unless it's a tooling / cost saving issue to continue stamping out the inferior 2.4l. hopefully that's a mistake in the article or the 2.5l will be used later in the year or 2014 (2015 model).
i actually like it better than  anything ive seen from them.
fwd and sick, wheezy little engines tugging around 2 tons of flab.
this much improved  interior and new found style should increase retail customer percentage.
this isn't mindless impala bashing - it is an honest  assessment of a product that just doesn't work as it is offered.
their space, value and style is what people like- most folks  could care less about rwd.
mustang fanboys probably don't like it bc it resembles the camaro.
i will  echo everybody else's sentiments concerning the steering wheel.
@autobug: the current car is a fleet king because its old and outdated and affordable.
alex daoriginal - 04/04/12 11:02 am i wouldn't  call it an icon but it's definitely one nice car  i hope this trend  continues.
not even in the same solar system as this  car.
the 4-cylinder engines, especially with the power outputs currently sited, have no place in the automobile of this size and legendary status.
i believe the taurus, avalon, cc, and maxima compete with the impala.
it doesn't worry the chrysler  twins (300 and charger) one bit.
a friend of mine actually has a gorgeous 65 impala.
with engineering choices not made by the bean-counters of old...but the political officers of the new regime.
and those four cylinder engines sound pathetic for a car of this size.

@autobug: the current car is a fleet king  because its old and outdated and affordable.
it's always been cross shopped with midsizers like the malibu,  fusion, camry, etc... maybe this new model will finally let it step up  to other competitors in it's intended class 92vectra1.6i - 04/04/12
this looks nothing like xts or lacrosse inside and  out.
the impala rides on a macpherson-strut front suspension and four-link rear independent suspension, and has its front cradle isolated from the rest of the car by way of a hydraulic ride bushing.
toycrusher -  04/04/12 04:58 am first decent looking impala in years.
with engineering choices not made by the bean-counters of old...but the  political officers of the new regime.
although the photos depict a loaded ltz, it looks as though chevy may have gotten this one right for a change.
those are probably the  closest, though they're rwd.
roadmastah - 04/04/12 07:22
but this looks much more  expensive than it will be.
sure, its based on the lacrosse platform, but very much a  different animal.

the car will be offered exclusively in front-wheel drive, and offer three engines to pair with a standard six-speed automatic transmission.
chevys new rwd sedan coming to replace the impala in nascar!!
and then i'll get interested see all 88 comments videos 2013 buick enclave driving footage video the 2013 buick enclave is taken for a spin in... 2014 chevrolet impala unveiling video more >>
mustang fanboys  probably don't like it bc it resembles the camaro.
04:44 am if 12.9 seconds through a quarter mile (the best time to date for my corvette 327 powered impala) doesn't qualify as fast, i'd hate to see what does.
am this model is a step in the right direction for the impala.
elgatofuego - 04/04/12 12:39 pm dang, it looks fantastic.
laserwizard - 04/04/12 01:18
i actually like it better than anything ive seen from them.
plus, gm's powertrain warranty matches chrysler's...better than ford or toyota.
i at least had hope...a front  wheel drive impala only conveys to the suspense-held public what everyone  feared; that absolutely nothing has changed.
through this touch screen, drivers can interface with chevy’s available mylink system, which incorporates bluetooth hands-free phone and streaming audio, plus optional navigation.
mh_5 - 04/04/12 03:12 pm finally an impala with some  substance!
maybe one of there new small blocks there working on, or a turbo/supercharged v-6.
redvette77 -  04/04/12 03:26 pm everyone seems to be missing the same thing.
this car is clearly full sized in terms of space.
i'm still not a fan of chevy tan and brown interiors and their tacky "ambient lighting" but i'd say that the avalon and azera has their work cut out for them.
they could have easily done something like a 65 impala rear tail lights.
but with the all-new 2014 chevrolet impala making its world debut at the 2012 new york auto show, the bow tie brand is promising to erase memories of the long-running nameplate’s largely forgettable outgoing model with a more refined interior, the latest in technology, and a vastly improved driving experience when it goes on sale in early 2013.
explore your financing options!
i can't help but notice how much it looks like the current azera  though.. almost like they had the azera on hand when they were designing this  car.
i think it looks  nicer on the outside than the taurus, but comes short of the azera on the  inside and out.
i just  dont think that moter will have the power to pull this car around, they might  want to add a blower to that motor to make it relevent.
when i glanced at the picture on the main page i instantly thought it was a new passat.
and we have just been told that  front end was for the trucks....
the interior is original  and looks great, but can we please get rid of akerson now for what he's doing  to gmdesign?
nemesis4 - 04/04/12 03:57 pm
throttleblip - 04/04/12 11:28 am car looks great but the ugly steering wheel looks just like the terrible unit found in the current gen mercedes s-class.
am since when did gm figure out that it's okay to make an attractive impala?
am at first i was kind of polarized by this car but its  growing on me!
am certainly some vw passat in that front end design.
there is nothing original here.
i  just read on another website that awd will not be offered on the impala.
35mpg is good though for such a large  car.
my mom  has a 2008 saturn vue xr awd (with one of the first iterations of gm's now  ubiquitous 3.6 v6 making around 270 hp).
but will they be enough to challenge other full-sizers like the toyota avalon, hyundai azera, and chrysler 300?
redvette77 - 04/04/12  05:56 am this.
i hope to see a little refinement.
am not a bad looking car inside and out, but mostly targeted at the rentals, and the ford taurus and avalons of the world.
sami_sa1 -  04/04/12 12:51 pm is this car is designed by a designer who works for kia/  hyundai and who is impressed by audi a7 rear end?
i just saw a new malibu at the local chevy dealer.
i will echo everybody else's sentiments concerning the steering wheel.
i really thought that lutz would've been able to pull it off; the trimming down, and building up of a truly competitive american brand.
everything will hinge on materials and build quality.
nothing like a huge, undulating gap in body panels to scream  quality.
surprised no one else has said anything.
as someone  else stated these new grills for the impala and traverse seem to be for their  upper class models however if you look at least on the impala it has two bars  in the grill symbolizing the single bar found on chevys.
lord  knows i love an ls-x over just about anything.
given the heritage that the impala has, where is there any originality in this?
overall, minus the ugly steering wheel, an incredible design masterpiece easily erasing the current impala from my mind..heres to hoping for an awd ss model!!
ambient lighting is available.
but seriously, who  cross shops impala's with anything in it's class?
xts has v6 only and offers awd.
it is an extremely nice car and sounds great with a huge lump of snarling iron under the hood, but it is by no means fast.
the curves and bulging fenders are a long way from the old slab-sided design language.
the interior is original and looks great, but can we please get rid of akerson now for what he's doing to gmdesign?
this looks way to much like a toyota.
i really thought that lutz would've been able to pull it off; the  trimming down, and building up of a truly competitive american brand.
it just doesn't work - some colors make this thing look  profoundly cheap.
way too busy in my opinion.
though the 2014 impala remains roughly the same size, its design has been dramatically revised.
am looks better then the its twins buick lacrosse and cadillac xts.
feel as though its  lost its sporty/athletic look in favor of a more premium look.
jimmytheg - 04/04/12  01:45 pm
this thing is all its own your brain is lying to you side by side pictures of what youre saying it looks like and youll feel stupid capitals - 04/04/12 01:46 pm overall a nice car inside/outside, but the four cylinders, i don't know maybe the turbo with 270hp will be okay in this car.
redvette77 - 04/04/12 05:56 am this.
i hope chevy comes out with an awd version, that would be pretty cool.
am i like the  camaro-esque front.
i haven't heard of that being a widespread issue, but i would hope for  better materials and build quality.
malibu uses the 2.4l only because the 2.5l was not yet ready, but next year all malibus will use the 2.5l, so why not the impala in 2013?
i think it is a  fantastic looking car, and compared to the old impala, this car is considerably  better on looks alone.
tibbz - 04/04/12 06:30
i am really impressed with  this car, and i'm sure it looks even better in person.
overall,  minus the ugly steering wheel, an incredible design masterpiece easily erasing  the current impala from my mind..heres to hoping for an awd ss model!!
dacronic1 - 04/04/12 10:34 pm y didnt this go rear wheel drive?
i like a lot of what i see, but that rear quarter just doesn't work !!
in this  day and age of fuel economy regulation, we are likely to never see a rwd car  for the masses (save for the charger/300).
the only thing i don't  like is that steering wheel.
beard - 04/04/12 06:50 am not bad.
still, leaps and bounds better than the current car.
the current impala is built  okay, but its interior on one of my relative's 2009 is already falling apart.
great combination for the road warriors that want good comfortable reliable transportation with some power.
the rest of the interior is well done though.
looks good,  but there's no flare like the impala has.
am hope there is an impala supersport in  the works to square off against the taurus sho, bring back the 5.3 ss version  with awd
i  wasn't expecting anything this nice.

pm why must chevy take design cues from other chevy models in their lineup and  incorporate them in a "redesigned" model?
that said, i think for what  this car is intended to be, it executes it quite well.
that being said, the styling of this car is just beautiful.
like the old gen better.
the v6s are what people buy anyway, not the hemi models.
but again, another brick from gm.
am hope there is an impala supersport in the works to square off against the taurus sho, bring back the 5.3 ss version with awd
this new grill styling, along  with the traverse, will be for the chevrolet “premium” models.
looks like a cheap korean ripoff of a toyota camry - the interior is more mishmash of design disasters from government motors - nothing works together - colors don't coordinate - textures are horrible - the exterior has a mishmash of dents, creases, and concepts.
wow, fantastic design along with the great  reliability and handling of chevrolet makes one great car!
am @connermt the fusion, accord,  camry, passat, and altima are not in the impala's class,they compete with the  malibu.
the new impala adds 1.2 inches to its wheelbase, though overall dimensions don’t change much (0.9 inches longer, 0.1 inches wider, and 0.2 inches taller.)
since an ss would need the (developing) 3.6l twin-turbo, and awd to handle the power.
pmirp1 - 04/04/12 02:54
chevrolet needs to offer a turbo 4 cylinder with  about 240 horsepower and more importantly, at least 250 lb-ft. with a goal of  35 mpg highway.
toycrusher - 04/04/12 04:58 am first decent looking impala in years.
it  does look more like a buick-wannabe or hyundai than a chevy, but lately, that's  been a good thing.

i  would have left the instrument cluster hood the same color as the rest of the  dash, but other than those two things, this car looks great.
surprised no  one else has said anything.
on top of that, none of the three cars have the exact same powertrains  choices.
front-wheel drive is for bargain, commuter cars, nothing more.

wow, i hate to say that i'm surprised, but i  am!
glad they are sticking with the 3.6 engine.
lord knows i love an ls-x over just about anything.
its fresh looking and graceful.
your eyes  must all be broken for real.
i just  am disappointed in the rear again.
for it to truly be a rebirth of an icon it would have to be rwd,  then it would be a truly amazing car, this however is a very good car for the  price and the segment, it looks great but at the end of the day its all show  and no go, where as the original impala did both amazingly.
unfortunately, we'll see a flood of these on the roads as  soon as gm pumps budget & hertz rental fleets full of these.
in fact malibu's shouldn't have only 4 cylinders only either.
shaking that rental car image will take some time, but these changes could go a long way in earning the nameplate back some of its lost prestige.
the people who buy this car not only do not care if it is fwd, rwd, or awd, they likely do not know the difference.
or should i say impasat?
the only models that had any kind of acceleration were the ss models and even then they weren't really speed demons.
taurus, 300, charger, azera, avalon?
this will retain it's title as the fleet queen.
am looks better  then the its twins buick lacrosse and cadillac xts.
it's still a pretty vanilla-looking car (not really a deal-killer considering how bland its closest competitors all look), but i admit it looks gorgeous when compared to the outgoing impala.
start by receiving a no-hassle quote for auto financing.
am can't believe i am saying this, but it really looks handsome.....
although i do suspect that chevy will raise the price some on  this car, i hope they don't raise it too much.
the value of the impala  has always been very strong!!!!
and the interior if this is def a  step up over the azera which basically has the interior of the elantra.
the efforts by manufacturers to compensate for the idiotic cafe regulations by the obozo administration have been tried before....with disastrous results.
and the price will likely  move closer to $30k to start.
i  really wanted to like the impala, mainly because of the late 80's, early 90's  ones (exc. 91-93)
i know the new impala will have some major technological advancements inside and out - i just hope it doesn't look too much like the camaro or the new bu... t2mgb18 - 04/02/12 11:47

the ls, lt, and ltz trims carry over to the 2014 impala, which will be built at gm’s detroit-hamtramck and oshawa, ontario (canada), plants.
nothing like a huge, undulating gap in body panels to scream quality.
am a decent efforts that reminds me of a cross between a camaro and charger that got dialed back a bit.
looks like some kind of california  ghetto carpeted dash cover you buy from jc whitney for $39.
at least this impala would easily fit in the garage unlike the old ones.
hate to see a nice design get watered down like that.
a nice thick, leather wrapped wheel with a simple  three spoke design and tasteful metal accenting.
for sure, it's nothing like the real impalas that were large, held six adults, v8s, coupes, and stylish from years ago, but for a family that needs 4 doors to cart people around, it should do ok.
it almost seems to me that  chevrolet might be creating a two-tier lineup.
am i like the camaro-esque front.
the general expects the 2.4-liter eassist model to be epa-rated at 35 mpg on the highway.
like it or not, at least they're trying.
" nonetheless, they'll sell a ton of these to police departments, rental car companies, and gm fans.
am nice new toyota,  you guys at g.m.!
their space, value and style is what people like- most folks could care less about rwd.
bring over the v-8 holden, you cowardly jackwads.
insulting this car because the current 7 year old car is a rental favorite is stupid.
this isn't a dig on the old impalas, i just think people are reaching a bit here and just remember the old impalas as better than they really were.
the rear door just looks terrible.
i've owned two impalas previously (a 2003 ls, and a 2008 lt), and they were both great cars!!!!
adamlink - 04/04/12 06:03 am
am it's a huge  improvement over the current impala, but the 2013 ford fusion still looks  better.
am i hope the rear is not some iteration of the camaro rear.
pm it looks like it should be rwd.
great lines, great details, great wheels.
pm too much car for a 4 cylinder.
my mom has a 2008 saturn vue xr awd (with one of the first iterations of gm's now ubiquitous 3.6 v6 making around 270 hp).
like it or not, at least they're  trying.
still starts at $59,825, rx 350 f sport arrives in july
what's with the  freaky-deaky hood?
i think it is the best looking front wheel drive sedan under 40.
i think it is a fantastic looking car, and compared to the old impala, this car is considerably better on looks alone.
the designers really hit one out of the park.
autobug2 - 04/04/12 06:42
this isn't mindless impala bashing - it is an honest assessment of a product that just doesn't work as it is offered.
and those four cylinder engines sound  pathetic for a car of this size.
the regular 2.4l is being phased out.
pm accord camry maxima a6 m35 etc in a blender.
i am impressed  with the look of this car.
i hope they have an awd drive option.
niether car looks bad but this just seems more masculine and american looking.

mynameisj - 04/04/12 10:52
i really like it with the blue color.
the  rear door just looks terrible.
the steering wheel looks like the ones in some mercedes, two: it's not a rwd.
personally i think it's a mistake.
the steering wheel and back end are disappointing though considering how good looking the rest is.
it's light years ahead of the current generation in  design: as in, there is some design.
let's hope it stays out of all models.
this car is great  and its a huge step forward for the impala and its one step closer to  greatness.
next-gen impala gets serious about style, amenities new car buyer's guide all our car data at your fingertips.

mh_5 - 04/04/12 03:12 pm finally an impala with some substance!

syj - 04/04/12 12:23 pm reading through the comments you can see who is being realistic and honest and who is offering mindless impala bashing.
i do however wonder what the advantage of eassist is when the normal  4-banger will produce more hp and similar fuel economy numbers in the real  world.
your eyes must all be broken for real.
this looks nothing like xts or lacrosse inside and out.

pm great looking car from the  outside.
it doesn't worry the chrysler twins (300 and charger) one bit.
too bad it's "exclusively fwd."
it would be huge for gm to offer this in awd.
the new impala has some mighty big shoes to fill, and will very likely be the  best fwd impala yet.
i wish gm would've taken  a similar design and built upon it for this car
but seriously, who cross shops impala's with anything in it's class?
@toycrusher: the current car is barely full sized.
in fact malibu's shouldn't have  only 4 cylinders only either.
am wife and i love it!
at least this impala would  easily fit in the garage unlike the old ones.
either way the impala looks good, the interior in the 9th  generation was horrible, the 8th gen was better.
cp_09malibuv6 - 04/04/12 07:15 am i like how this design wont overshadow the handsome new malibu, the way  the new malibu makes the cruze look cheaper by comparison.
it would be great if an ss version with a strong v-8 would also be offered in the future.
am a decent efforts that reminds me of a  cross between a camaro and charger that got dialed back a bit.
vertigo5110 - today 08:10 am i think anybody still hoping/praying for rwd on this car is kidding themselves.

i've owned two  impalas previously (a 2003 ls, and a 2008 lt), and they were both great  cars!!!!
what's really impressive about '65 to '70 full size chevrolets isn't their impressive acceleration capability when equipped with upper tier v8's (325 horsepower and up), but their modern road manners, especially when equipped with the optional after '67 front disc brakes and accompanying 15 inch wheels.
this car is going to be much more expensive with all the bells and whistles and its brand new.
and the interior if this is def a step up over the azera which basically has the interior of the elantra.

there's only two things i don't like  about it-
i was looking at it while i was sitting in traffic.
if this car falls in the league of toyota avalon & ford taurus, then the new 2013 ford taurus is tighter, cohesive and better looking car.
but overall i do like the design.
gm could have done a better job on the dash pad, it appears to be an afterthought.
a wide grille is front and center, framed by a pair of low-profile projector headlamps which sweep around the corners of the front end.
wow, i hate to say that i'm surprised, but i am!
maybe one of there new small blocks there working on, or a turbo/supercharged  v-6.
the only thing i don't like is that steering wheel.
and now i can't wait to see the silverado/tahoe/ and c7 corvette!
the only thing i don't like is the steering wheel,  which has always been a problem for gm.
2.5 good for malibu, bad for impala.
this doesnt offer awd and it offers the 2.5l. lacrosse doesnt offer  the 2.5 and offers awd.

one of the things that made impala a legend was it's strong engine, and if this car will only provide moderate performance it will also be considered a dud in the future (like the current generation impala).
given the heritage that the impala has,  where is there any originality in this?
am and please tell me why this is not a direct competitor with the malibu.
weird to keep the 2.4l around unless  it's a tooling / cost saving issue to continue stamping out the inferior 2.4l.   hopefully that's a mistake in the article or the 2.5l will be used later  in the year or 2014 (2015 model).
lay off the sauce name one car in this segment that has a more masculine front end.
connermt - 04/04/12 08:03 am not crazy about the rear end, but leaps and bounds ahead of the current model in terms of design.
looks pretty sharp, and that interior seems pretty fantastic.
pm think it  has been improved and agree some of the design is busy.
why so big and flat in the center?
seems like to me that gm is trying to protect  the sales of the more expensive models based on this platform - the buick  lacrosse and cadillac xts.
everything  will hinge on materials and build quality.
finally looking like the 90's impala.
its a huge step up in the styling dept from the invisible 9th gen impala but whats with the 3 creases in the rear door?!
am @psycowboy: badge  engineering?
people think  this looks like an azera?
, stunning car, i love the sharp crease at the rear.
i don't  love it, but it looks decent.
will the quality be there, that's the question.

well, hertz, avis and budget just soiled their skivvies.
so we now have a chevy cc, i understand the v6 and the semi-hyrbrid, but wtf is with that normal 2.5?
i really cannot believe it look this good.
a friend of mine actually has a  gorgeous 65 impala.

the 4-cylinder engines, especially with the power outputs  currently sited, have no place in the automobile of this size and legendary  status.
hate to see a  nice design get watered down like that.
i sure hope that picture is wrong that’s a pretty sad impala.
save money on your car insurance!
i see a really ugly honda not a chevy... mixed news with  this one, needs an ss model and all wheel drive to battle the ford sho.
i think gm has created another huge improvement in its line up.
i like chevy's, but i don't like this car.
one of the things that made impala a legend was it's strong engine,  and if this car will only provide moderate performance it will also be  considered a dud in the future (like the current generation impala).
a central 4.2-inch color display within the wraparound instrument cluster relays the driver information, while an 8-inch touch screen with a hidden storage compartment behind it adorns the center stack.

this isn't a dig on the  old impalas, i just think people are reaching a bit here and just remember the  old impalas as better than they really were.
i think anybody  still hoping/praying for rwd on this car is kidding themselves.
i really wanted to like the impala, mainly because of the late 80's, early 90's ones (exc. 91-93)

what's really impressive about '65 to '70 full size chevrolets isn't their  impressive acceleration capability when equipped with upper tier v8's (325  horsepower and up), but their modern road manners, especially when equipped  with the optional after '67 front disc brakes and accompanying 15 inch wheels.
i dont  understand why people think that rwd is the main reason for the success of the  chrysler lx cars.
click to view gallery gm says the new impala’s stronger structure enhances the quietness of the full-size sedan’s passenger compartment, and improves the handling and ride.
lasvegascolonel - 04/04/12 12:35 pm having  lived through the great impalas that were large cars, v8s, stylish, coupes, and  breathtaking in many ways, i wouldn't normally praise these kid hauler impalas  (sedans), but this is nicely styled and i would consider this over a more bland  camry or accord.
the only thing i don't like is the steering wheel, which has always been a problem for gm.
the cafe regs are making cars lame again  like they did in the late 1970's.
the value of the impala has always been very strong!!!!
the door panels and dashboard get soft-touch materials, while the seats are meant to look more premium than the old model with higher-quality stitching.
pm it looks like it should be  rwd.
it's light years ahead of the current generation in design: as in, there is some design.
unless its rear  drive, itll never perform like those two.
sccardriver - 04/04/12 11:23 am this car is a much larger car than the new malibu is.
