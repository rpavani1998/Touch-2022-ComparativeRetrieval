the funny thing is that although people own acreages around here, even thousands of acres, they're still buying their chemically soaked, imported foods in the supermarkets, as they're too lazy to grow things.

granted, poor families can rent homes for less in the interior, but until they put in a garden with good soil (and buy rakes and shovels hoses - canning equipment) they are going to have a higher food bill than in the lower mainland.
if you read this, the definition, in itself does not equate to poverty.
by the measure of the fraser institute, we have more than 1.6 million canadians -- hundreds of thousands of whom are children -- living in serious deprivation, conditions which are hazardous for health and development.

if you survived for a year or so on equivalent pro rata amounts, you were desperately poor and the fact you have no empathy for someone in a similar situation with two young children tells us less about poverty than it does about you.

ultimately, that kind of sportingexcludes the vast majority of boys; it effectively locks out those most in need of constructive socialization (i.e. unathletic boys, loners, gay/effeminate boys, etc.).
the fraser institute's rationale for its approach is that the statistics canada  lines are too generous; they don't measure "true deprivation,"  thereby misrepresenting the number of people in canada that can truly be  labelled poor or impoverished.

as you have probably guessed by now, the fraser institute and campaign  2000 define poverty very differently, and this leads to very contrasting  interpretations of what it is to live in poverty in canada.
campaign 2000 relies on statistics canada to provide the yardstick.

it also makes it easier to put the blame elsewhere (public school, for instance) if things don't go according to expectations.

on the other hand, if i take time off work, ride a huge diesel bus back home, wait for a plumber to drive his big diesel truck to my home to spend 5 minutes fixing the tap, then ride a huge diesel bus back to work again, that's supposed to add to the gdp.
sarlo defends his basic approach by asserting that his income lines measure not being able to afford the basic necessities of life.

pedagogical feminism was very aware that girls were missing out an this essential rite of passage, whereby boys were learning how to co-operate in groups, take and give direction, handle getting knocked down & picking themselves up again, and how to manage self-esteem in an environment in which defeat was part of the game, and mutual criticism a necessary and depersonalized exercise in team progress.

i'm still a fan of the small jesuit and dominican colleges which consistently turned out high-quality thinkers using a time-tested curriculum, and they always provided for students from low-income households to enter and perform on an equal footing, but that's my personal opinion.
i think the social interactions of daycare are vastly overstated.
we're speaking in generalities here.
and this has what to do with learning to take turns?

then after high school, students go to either technical institutes run and supervised by professional bodies in tandem with government, or public arts and humanities institutes run by people with a genuine love for the material rather than a pernicious ideologically polarized agenda of dismantlement, vandalism and reckless revisionism.

i personally favour a return to the old grammar school model, which a back-to-basics traditional liberal curriculum and gender-segregated classes in critical topics with observable learning differentials from grade 6 to completion (i.e. the formative and over-sensitive puberty years).
the poverty debt can be directly addressed through canada's national child benefit.
canada needs to raise the skill level of our workers to be competitive in the new knowledge economy.

how much of this will be coming to canada, buying up more land, welcomed by our idiot politicians and economists, while our own people are forced into city shoeboxes?
well, one report was from the fraser institute, a vancouver-based think  tank that primarily proposes competitive market solutions to social problems.

for two-parent families with children, the median income level was nearly $72,000.
however, with cattle prices pressed down by the multinational feedlots, more and more ranchers are losing their lands, taken over by the agribiz mafia.
the fraser institute's rationale for its approach is that the statistics canada lines are too generous; they don't measure "true deprivation," thereby misrepresenting the number of people in canada that can truly be labelled poor or impoverished.
god help the poor in canada because it will only get worse.
it used to be that people would make cherry pies or vegetable dishes or whatever.
it's pretty incompetent that this happened.
the universities, on the other hand, were able to build firewalls against this kind of cooptation by political exigencies, while skimming the cream of the foreign student crop in order to harvest their massive tuition fees (foreign students in canadian universities pay between 3-5 times the going rate for canadian citizens, hence to drive to pack classrooms with the english-speaking children of the overseas post-colonial elites...
this makes sense inasmuch as this puts you (and children especially) at a disadvantage in participating in your community and in society.
if instead one just 'learns' to accept whatever it suits other people to fork over, that is not learning to be happy, that's being a doormat.

generous deprivation neither the fraser institute nor campaign 2000 can claim to have the "right" definition of poverty -- choices about what level of income constitutes a poverty line is a representation of values, goals and objectives.
