if this car succeeds, i guess magna will be very busy w/ orders and contracts ;-) 2 years ago family guy, the hope that the range will improve is realistic.
the focus ev will not be a plug-in series hybrid, sometimes referred to as “extended-range electric vehicle,” which carries a small engine on board to recharge the batteries on the fly.
similarly, the ev becomes a viable option for my coworker because now he can charge his vehicle while at work for the drive home.
1 year ago yahoo -- i am a ford stockholder and extremely excited about the release of an all electric vehicle.
2 years ago what the world needs is an electric car designed like a computer.
now if you go just 30mph, you will use somewhere between 80-100wh/mi.
airport has an "airporter" here so driving to the airport is a non issue here.
the implications of this vehicle could be pretty far-reaching, if they can get it to market at a price people will pay.
the 48,000kwh costs about $5.7k at residential prices.
by the way, it may be difficult to get across to the layperson, but just because a full charge will take 6 or 12 hours (or whatever they said) doesn't mean that you drive your hundred miles and then are stranded somewhere for hours.
btw at current retail prices, a 23kwh lifepo4 battery costs about $6k. fuel cost is 8.7 cents per mile for a 30mpg combined compact car.
the ev will do the same thing.
- the major auto manufacturers only released their 1990's evs in a few dealers in very few states, predominantly california.
(nissan is aiming for $25,000 to $30,000 for its ev; and the chevy volt will cost in the range of $40,000.)
it will tell a whole lot.
think better place, but you don't have to use their car, and their battery, and that ridiculous "cell phone" model.
eg, after my hypothetical 80-mile round-trip commute, even if i can't charge at work, i almost always am at home for an hour or two before going out to do anything for the evening.
add the ev option to what looks like a complete line up of 2-door coupe, 2-door convertible, 3-door hatch, 4-door sedan, 5-door hatch and 5-door estate ( wagon) and foord will have a hit on its hands.
i have everything i need right on my side of the city including a hospital, eating place, super centers, movies etc.
an electric focus will fill my needs very well.
2 years ago hybridgreg, this is not rocket science.
sorry for the mis-print 2 years ago this is easily the way to go for that second car, or the kids car.
2 years ago familyguy, you could always give your friend $2.00 and charge at his house.
unfortunately, car makers must focus on the decision at the time of purchase since it is nothing if they can't sell the car.
as allen del said, he has never had a need to use his extension cord.
i normally put less than a hundred miles on the car in week.
even the prius does that now as a hybrid, which is why its city mileage is greater than its highway mileage.
ford is the first to sign on.
lets take an example, say the range is 100 miles going a constant 60mph.
this is such an old article with such outdated and just wrong information.
by ford: in 73 with a maverick that, for no apparent reason, liked to take unplanned "furloughs" after 20 minutes on the highway.
that’s the direction that nissan is taking with thenissan leaf, due out in limited markets in late 2010.
but, not paying for gas is better.
at least the 6-12 hour recharge time gives us the chance to drink a lot of good beer.
2 years ago as the owner of a prius hybrid gas/electric and a zenn all electric vehicle, this ford ev makes nothing but sense to me.
i hope the offer this in the focus hatchback version as well.
this is pretty neat, i would love to have an electric car.
if the battery is just one module, the 100 mile car can become a 200, 300, or 400 mile car by changing the battery module.
too many ev's have been top end race cars and nothing for the family guy.
so while the car will be a step in the right direction, it still isn't for everyone.
if anyone want's information on the focus electric, just go to ford.com.
you save a few dollars by eliminating it and pay a whole lot when the batteries go bad early without it.
i drive it almost every day and my electric bill for the chaging is about $10 per month.
magna will also share in the engineering responsibility to integrate the electric propulsion system into the ford focus electric.
of course, since the car will last a long time, maybe we'll spend more money on wax jobs, body work, and other cosmetic maintenance...
pricing is not yet announced, but trimming the cost obviously will give ford the ability to aim for affordability and profitability.
a ford focus ev at $25k with a $7500 tax incentive would outsell supply.
the ford focus electric is targeted to have a range of 100 miles between charges, courtesy of a 23 kwh battery pack.
again cost is extremely important here as battery costs, charge time, and mileage will need to improve for a majority of american's.
my friend lives 65 miles away, so i can't make it round trip without re-charging.
can't wait to see all the pure electric cars on the street.
furthermore, ford’s deal with magna is non-exclusive—so the same system could be used by ford’s competition to make an electric cars.
when i come out to drive the car for the next trip, the batteries have charged plenty.
anything above 28k would not work unless they add a small ice to extend the range.
the focus ev will not be a plug-in series hybrid, sometimes referred to as “extended-range electric vehicle,” which carries a small engine on board to recharge the batteries on the fly.
also, early sketches of the 2012 focus show a vastly improved exterior appearance.
2 years ago a month ago i could only see driving a toyota or honda for the rest of my life.
personally, i see this as the best news i've heard in some time.
pre-packaged technology the second cost-cutting measure is ford’s use of generic pre-made electric car technology.
the braking system switched between regenerative and regular braking smoothly with no noticeable hiccups throughout the process.
n/a mpg n/a l/100km sedan electric n/a 2 years ago one american car company is not being complacent regarding evs from china.
the powertrain, including the motor and gearbox, are packaged under the hood where you would expect to see a gasoline engine.
you don't get any points in my mind until you actually roll these things out at a decent price.
when leaving, look at how many 'kilowatt-hours' your charge consumed on your friends' outlet.
the problem with making it a family car is that if the wife wants to go to the store and then get her hair done and the teenager wants to use to go to the mall and then to a football game; by the time the husband leaves for his friend's house 60 miles away, he will not have a full charge.
i would buy one of these tomorrow if the price was $25k or hopefully less.
at 300k miles, that is $26k.
i happen to fall into that category, so i could theoretically buy one of these cars to get back and forth to work, and to run most of my errands around town.
now i'm ready to give ford another chance, provided their ev is well-engineered and they price it realistically.
2 years ago wow, ford keeps cranking out hits...
well, the electric cars are always welcomed by the car lovers as they are the money saving and energy saving cars.
drive over a 100 miles, with brakes charging the batteries, & a generator if needed.
“at first, she was surprised that it wasn’t merely a concept car, but actually a road-ready demonstrator of battery electric vehicle technology,” said gioia.
by choosing an existing platform, ford will save the expense associated with developing a unique design.
the volt will make an excellent primary car but who wants to spend $40k. if there is a tax incentive it should equally apply to all the electric cars.
when going on long trips, you could just put them in your trunk.
remember 2 years ago i have bought only honda for last 18 years after being burned by us cars.
when the ford gt came out a few years ago, our local dealer marked it up $250k.
the second cost-cutting measure is ford’s use of generic pre-made electric car technology.
then ford will have to prove to me that i should stay with them.
and that doesn't take into consideration consumables for gasoline engines which cost $200-300 a year in planned maintenance.
when michigan’s gov. jennifer granholm took a spin of the focus ev at the detroit show, she was impressed.
12 weeks ago so... a 20k car gets it's internal combustion engine replaced with a bank of batteries and a straight drive electric motor and now it's 40k, this deal is too good to pass!
that senario does not have to play out too many times before the all electric "family car" is going to get a role change.
hoping there will be some "fast charge topup" option too to get a boost in say 30mins 2 years ago too much money to go 100 miles on a charge.
on most compact cars this works out to 160-200wh/mi which then means a 16-20kwh battery.
i have no idea what they're planning or working on, but one option off the top of my head might be to have a small, replaceable auxiliary battery -- included with the car -- that could be easily swapped out for a fully charged unit and with enough juice to go 5 or 10 miles or so.
fully recharging could take from 6 to 12 hours, depending if you are using a 110-volt or 220-volt hookup.
but you encounter terrible traffic and it takes you an extra hour to get home.
not only ford, but u also rocks as the presentation of the article is quite interesting.
i'll follow consumer reports' ratings on the ev.....and if they're any good, i'll switch over to ford one time.
i almost never drive over 50 miles without an opportunity to recharge and i suspect most of the drivers in the country are not that different from me.
good job, keep the hits coming.
lets try 2 years ago steve, the point is well taken.
no tune-ups, rare - if ever - brake pad replacement, no oil changes.
the biggest drawback was people wanting to "jawbone" about it all the time.
2 years ago hybridgreg, you said: "remembering that no single all-electric car offering has sold more that about 17,000 units in the us makes me think that we are a ways away from convincing the consumer.
early reviews of the focus ev pre-production vehicles have been positive—with kudos for brisk acceleration, top-notch build-quality, and handling and braking much better than your average pre-production car.
that way you won't have to consume so much good beer that you can't drive back home safely.
the answer could be the ford focus electric due out in late 2011—the first electric car designed for the generic aisle of the dealership.
ford is gambling that the cool factor lies in the technology and price, not in the car’s name or the shape of the sheet metal.
i'd have to recharge at his house and it would be on his utility bill.
just another reason why this country is going down the tubes financially.
2 years ago this car is a start to try to convince people to move to all electric.
i think the focus is the right size as well, let your other car be the larger station wagon/suv/minivan/midsized sedan or whatever you think you need to accomodate your family on a trip, the ev is for commuting.
2 years ago i've always thought that most 2 car families(in the us thats the norm) could certainly have one car be an ev, if the other is a hybrid or phev then you get to a really good place as far as fuel consumption.
(sure, those other companies expect to ramp up production, realize economies of scale, and eventually reduce costs down to reason.
as long as the price isn't too high (it's not like the car is going to get a bunch of points for styling)
2 years ago i doubt a car stereo system could drain a 23kwh battery if it was left on for a week .
but i know all of the quick routes in my city so this car would be perfect for me.
evs are the way to go if someone will actually make them and sell them.
when michigan’s gov. jennifer granholm took a spin of the focus ev at the detroit show, she was impressed.
2 years ago the range is an estimate likely by using either a epa type city loop or some known average driving activity for a typical driver.
2 years ago my little zenn ev has a range of 35 miles on a charge.
2 years ago cost is the million dollar question.
but most will discharge it well below that at 20-30% dod where the battery will last 15k cycles or more (>30 years).
new focus will likely look something like the crisp iosis max concept that we were shown at this year’s geneva motor show.
it's great to see this sort of car coming to the dealers.
it looks more practical than toyota ft-ev or mitsubishi imev anyway.
2 years ago this would work great for our second car.
you could make a similar arrangement at work to let you 'top up' while there.
you will never se $1.00 per gallon for gas again, the big oil companies will see to that.
it is true that electric cars are not great in number.
if you bring the beer, most friends will let you recharge on thier dime.
the powertrain, including the motor and gearbox, are packaged under the hood where you would expect to see a gasoline engine.
i suspect, though, that it will not be very well received for families that have more than one driver; even if the drive to work is less than 30 miles.
even the maximum charge of 23kwh would only be around $2-$3, depending on power rates.
fact check: - toyota allowed about 200 of their rav4evs to be sold for about 6 months in 2002 and around 100 each of ford ranger evs and chevy s10evs were sold after they came off of fleet leases.
electric drivetrains last for a long, long, looooong time.
i'm thinking there would be some type of solar charger that could be hooked up to the car to charge as you go like the prius roof top solar.
time will tell but effort is needed to make it actually happen if we are going to have a future standard of living like that which we enjoy today.
ford is gambling that the cool factor lies in the technology and price, not in the car’s name or the shape of the sheet metal.
the reason why the focus ev pack has a larger capacity is that lifepo4 batteries last longer if they are not fully discharged every use.
while i'm not going to get a full charge in that amount of time, i will certainly be able to add another 30 or 35 miles to the remaining range.
it’s a kind of inferiority complex that pushes them to produce ultra-hip, spectacularly innovative, or screaming fast electric vehicles—and to brand them as revolutionary—even though it drives the cost up and out of range for most consumers.
2 years ago hackers will juice this car up to a 200 - 300 mile range and it will be great, its the same way the early pc was souped up.
as soon as i can get a highway legal electric car, i will do so.
2 years ago i already have an electric car, but it is only street legal and as i live in a small town, it is great.
but the transition will not be sudden and to enter into the world without petroleum unprepared could be catastrophic.
th next generation ford focus is going to be a hot looking car.
that same 16kwh allows you to drive 200 miles.
fully recharging could take from 6 to 12 hours, depending if you are using a 110-volt or 220-volt hookup.
does it have a hatchback,etc. 16 weeks ago sigh, they just rolled out pricing at $40k.
ford used a similar strategy with its sync in-car entertainment system, developed in partnership with microsoft, which can sell the technology to other automakers.
2 years ago if ford is focusing on price they are on the right track.
king county metro's electric trolley bus fleet is operating on 30+ year old electric motors that have been rebuilt and placed into new buses.
focus ev had enough torque to spin it's inside front wheel when accelerating through turns and provide ample power for brisk acceleration.
early reviews of the focus ev pre-production vehicles have been positive—with kudos for brisk acceleration, top-notch build-quality, and handling and braking much better than your average pre-production car.
i don't think that this is finally the "ev for everyone in every situation".
my wife and i could have a prius (or ford fusion hybrid) as our "main/long distance" car, and this could be our around town commuter.
insolvency advice 6 weeks ago this was an excellent and fun article to read.
my commute round trip is 92 and an extra couple miles if i stop at the stores on the way home.
the new ford focus electric car promises to travel 100 miles per charge from its lithium-ion battery pack, whose technology is several thousand dollars more expensive than its traditional gas propulsion system.
ford definitely can make good vehicles if they put their minds to it.
1 year ago of course this vehicle won't be for everybody but it would be a dream come true for me.
but you can make it look like a racing stripe this would give you perhaps a few extra miles especially stuck in traffic, they probably have thought about it.
remember that electricity is much cheeper after 11:00 pm.
i took off the "electric vehicle" sticker to nip that in the bud.
an all-electric vehicle with a 100+ mile range would be perfect for the type of driving i do.
what if you commute is 40 miles each way, 80 miles total, under the 100 mile limit.
i think gm is a crock and liars, i wouldn't believe anything they say...yes they employ americans, but they sell more cars in china...and prius has a new plant in tupelo ms.... 2 years ago my last vehicle was dodge, now i drive 2010 prius....
every single one of those cars found a recipient to lease it and there were thousands of people on the waiting lists.
i have really enjoyed all of this very cool and fun information.
i will buy a discrete sedan ev when it becomes available.
“at first, she was surprised that it wasn’t merely a concept car, but actually a road-ready demonstrator of battery electric vehicle technology,” said gioia.
i remember for a while now we've been hearing that some large percentage of the population -- certainly large enough to constitute a "market" -- commutes under 40 miles to work each way.
this makes all the difference in owning an electric vehicle.
the cost to develop volt types will be more than ev's but may reduce some concerns initially.
but remember, talk is cheap.
i agree with all that the average family will probably want to keep an ice, hev, or phev as their 2nd car for longer road trips but this can significantly offset someones dependence on gasoline.
get yourself a 'kill-a-watt' (or equivalent) device to plug in with, assuming the car's charge controller doesn't have some sort of power meter (though it won't measure loss in the extension cord).
i think gm is a crock and liars, i wouldn't believe anything they say...yes they employ americans, but they sell more cars in china...and prius has a new plant in tupelo ms.... 2 years ago i've owned toyotas since 1981.
i don't know about you, but it would be pretty easy for me and my family to keep track of a typical weeks worth of errands.
the ford focus electric will be based on the next-generation ford focus, a capable if not head-turning car.
16/23kwh is about a 70% dod (70% of the capacity is used).
in fact, ford is encouraging magna to spread the high-tech love, because magna’s success with ev technology will increase the chances that other car companies will help defray costs.
now that ford seems to be making sensible cars, let us hope that buyers will make sensible purchases.
but then it will be great for a lot of people, especially if we see another jump in prices at the pump between now and then.
now i know you are all gonna smash on me for this because, "they are too expensive," "it's not for the common man," etc.
then i purchased a 76 mercury monarch that died a natural death on the highway 3 weeks after i bought it.
ford will have the most complete line up of alternative energy vehicles!
2 years ago i wouldn't worry too much about your friends' electric bills.
my prius has a sophisticated battery management system and the zenn did not come with one.
this car would be perfect for my family and make me consider american again!
i will not see the day, but the real choice is not far away.
if the lifetime cost of "fuel" is included, the electric car has a huge advantage, but we don't see that at up front when we are making the decision.
2 years ago i love my existing (old, 2000, european) focus, and an electric variant would be great given i only usually travel 5-20 miles to work/town.
we already have a car we only use around town, but unfortunately it runs on gas.
usually around $0.14~$0.24 per kw/h. multiply the electrical rate by number of kilowatts that you consumed while plugged in, during your visit.
2 years ago ex-ev1 driver, i want to make a correction to your fact checking.
it’s a kind of inferiority complex that pushes them to produce ultra-hip, spectacularly innovative, or screaming fast electric vehicles—and to brand them as revolutionary—even though it drives the cost up and out of range for most consumers.
2 years ago i wonder if it is possible for the car to tow an itty-bitty gasoline generator behind it for long drives.
i hope that this is a good step towards another ev's with greater range and quicker recharges.
back and forth 15 miles to work, with some shopping on the side.
will be interesting to see the final msrp and how much the local dealers jack up the price with "dealer mark up".
maybe an enterprising private company starts rolling out a network of them around town.
i really do appreciate everything so much.
i carry an extension cord for the possibility that i might need a charge while i am away (most gas stations have a place to plug it).
http://www.teslamotors.com/media/press_room.php?id=1380 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tesla_roadster 2 years ago you could always get a kill-a-watt meter to plug the car into - that way you will know how much electricity your car consumed and can reimburse your friend.
we have been replying on fossil fuel for far too long.
my son may well see the day when gasoline cars are mostly a memory.
however it is a significant step because if it lives up to the claims in this article, it will be the first ev on the market that is suitable for a very large number of people.
michigan governor jennifer granholm (left) and nancy gioia, director of sustainable mobility technologies at ford, check out the ford focus ev at the 2009 detroit auto show.
1 year ago my husband has a focus, and it's a great car (apart from a little too much road noise).
despite the low per mile cost of energy for an ev, any cost savings vs. gasoline will likely be eaten up when you replace the battery pack every 6-10 years or so.
magna will also share in the engineering responsibility to integrate the electric propulsion system into the ford focus electric.
as long as i remain in my city and carefully plan, i could not exceed the 100 mile round trip.
i believe many people would appreciate these changes knowing that you will not be giving your money to the middle east.
that’s the direction that nissan is taking with thenissan leaf, due out in limited markets in late 2010.
the generator head in the trailer would be run off a v-belt from one of the trailers wheels to the generator head thus supplying power without using any gasoline at all and extending trips indefinately............ 2 years ago this is great!
sort of like what better place is trying to do but since it would only be used in emergency situations, it would not have to be fully automated and all of that.
in the greater toronto area there are well over 5 million people within 50km of work, km making up a lot less miles means everyone is a potential customer for being able to buy this car to get to work everyday and manage to not encounter energy problems.
2 years ago one item he would confirm was that there would be none of the whole leasing and taking back of the electric cars that other companies are still infamous for.
2 years ago finally, an ev which isn't a freak show.
if that battery pack drains before dad can get back home, he will not be a happy camper.
(sure, those other companies expect to ramp up production, realize economies of scale, and eventually reduce costs down to reason.
i agree that this car would be great for a second car option.
2 years ago i would still carry a little honda 2kw genny in the trunk.
my commute to work is only 6 miles (all around).
similarly, my coworker who lives in another town 40 miles away may not be able to use it because it's just cutting it too close.
2 years ago ex-ev1 driver, that was a typo 1700 is the number i was elluding to and that was for any given year for evs.
that's a pretty cheap way to travel 100 miles.
they would/could be pretty heavy, but if designed properly, they could be about 30lbs each or so, and modular.
fix or repair daily has moved to be a respected again.
plus, with plans to release a model s for around 50k and then a vehicle after that for the same price range being discussed for these cars, it's a pretty bang up job.
it will be very interesting to see what ford comes up with in the way of roadside assistance of the sort that you usually get with the first year of a new car.
the answer could be the ford focus electric due out in late 2011—the first electric car designed for the generic aisle of the dealership.
in fact, ford is encouraging magna to spread the high-tech love, because magna’s success with ev technology will increase the chances that other car companies will help defray costs.
25 weeks ago very interested in focus ev. would like more info.
2 years ago i am on my 4 th escort now and all of them were driven way over 100k miles with no major problems.
if you are on the road, you will have to get a motel to wait for your battery to charge which will run the price up even more.
terrible traffic won't significantly alter any of the math.
in the two years that i have had mine, it has paid for itself, as i bought it what gas was at $4.00 per gallon ..
we'll still take the family on weekend outings in the minivan but by only using for back and forth to work during the week it will last me about 1.5 weeks.
the ford focus electric is targeted to have a range of 100 miles between charges, courtesy of a 23 kwh battery pack.
2 years ago how about one of those little trailers that motorcyclists pull behind their bikes with a generator head that would supply enough power to run the car and a switch to change on the fly from the vehicles batteries to the generator head in the towable trailer.
especially if your boss falls in love with electric car, too.
it's not like when you run out of gas, and they can drive up with a can of gasoline and give you enough to get to the gas station.
the ford focus electric will be based on the next-generation ford focus, a capable if not head-turning car.
as cool michigan governor jennifer granholm (left) and nancy gioia, director of sustainable mobility technologies at ford, check out the ford focus ev at the 2009 detroit auto show.
i had an ev 20 years ago (ex airport stock, suburu 600(?) van), which ran fine.
i saw a ford ranger electric last week with nimh batteries.
5 weeks ago the best thing is how little it has to go spending 100 milles, without a doubt will make the competition to the normal focus more information about formatting options
i guess this car would be aimed at someone like me, who lives about 6 miles from work and rarely goes out of town.
even adding in the full cost of the battery (likely less as the cells can be remanufactured back to full capacity for a lot less than virgin stuff), the savings are $14k over the life of the battery.
but then again, no manufacturer has ever built more than about 1,200 all-electric cars and none ever allowed more than about 200 to even be put up for sale.
in other words, ford is using a system already developed by magna international, a major global auto supply and technology firm, which has been looking for a carmaker to use its new pre-packaged electric car architecture, including motor, transmission, motor controller, lithium ion battery system and charger.
i'm disabled and rarely leave my immediate community.
2 years ago that is one cool looking electric car.
all this also expands the market for additional models from ford as well as competitors.
once again i must say, the writer drove the car with great intensities.
even if you somehow wear out the motor, i imagine that could be replaced.
it was produced in 1998 and is still running great with no maintenance except new tires.
“i think she was wowed by how it’s quiet, smooth and fun to drive.”
the passion of reading of ford focus ev is so thrilling and smashing that i am quite desperate to drive it crazily!!
so a charge-up isn't mutch.
“i think she was wowed by how it’s quiet, smooth and fun to drive.”
long trips are the only problem(ie 5000miles).
will be putting $100 down on a leaf next week, and will probably follow through on the purchase if nothing more comes out of ford between now and august.
i will strongly consider nissan leaf and ford focus ev for my next vehicle....hint: you can contact car companies directly and tell them you want evs and hybrids, espec.
2 years ago nice idea, but it's strictly a commuter's car.
go ford.. 2 years ago dude, just like the internet and wifi has changed everyone's lives.
now if fully discharged to 70%dod every time, the battery will last 3,000 cycles (full capacity drops to 18kwh).
(nissan is aiming for $25,000 to $30,000 for its ev; and the chevy volt will cost in the range of $40,000.)
to make this car even better, ford should come up with som kind of phantom sunroof, not a sunroof but a solar panel that looks like a sun roof!
so i bought a tercel in 77 and fell in love with toyota.
2 years ago sure this car won't be fore everyone (only 90% of americans live within 40 miles of their work)
furthermore, ford’s deal with magna is non-exclusive—so the same system could be used by ford’s competition to make an electric cars.
so the purchase is made without a battery management system and then the customer is unhappy.
when people find themselves saving a $100 every week or 2 with this- they will be sold.
american innovation is alive and we'll see great products ahead in the electric world.
ford used a similar strategy with its sync in-car entertainment system, developed in partnership with microsoft, which can sell the technology to other automakers.
instead, you’ll need to plan your travels to get back to a plug before you use up the 100 miles worth of energy.
and they were great, a lot of useful information.
the *real* savings in these vehicles will be maintenance.
i suppose i could get a rental for those 2-3 times per year, but towing a little generator would be better.
if it won't work, its not for you or you need to reconsider your travel patterns.
http://www.macktruck.org 1 year ago electric cars use either zero or next to zero electricity when you are not moving.
by choosing an existing platform, ford will save the expense associated with developing a unique design.
i think this car is ideal for a second car.
in terms of the "60 miles to a friend to see a friend," i was noting family guys post.
2 years ago ideal for my wife who drives 10 miles to work.
better batteries are inevitable.
in other words, ford is using a system already developed by magna international, a major global auto supply and technology firm, which has been looking for a carmaker to use its new pre-packaged electric car architecture, including motor, transmission, motor controller, lithium ion battery system and charger.
if the price comes in below $25k i can see a lot of commuters (like me) taking advantage of the fuel cost savings.
our travel patterns are pretty consistent.
my employer, or that theme park i was talking about, can now think about installing charging stations at some of their parking facilities.
6 weeks ago this was really so very interesting and fun to read.
