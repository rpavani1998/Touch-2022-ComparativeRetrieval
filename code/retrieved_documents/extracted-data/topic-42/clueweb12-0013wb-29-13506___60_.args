those kids living in at-risk families or disadvantaged homes would obviously benefit even more from quality child care.also, a competitive market economy not only doesn't solve poverty, but increases it, because all forms of competition increase energy inputs, which jack up prices.raising the amount of the benefit for families with children provides immediate relief and lifts children out of deep and destructive poverty.centralized daycare is an example a poor example, as the research for the most part suggests children who have been in a daycare setting are often better prepared in terms of social development and beginning literacy and math skills for elementary school.steep housing costs in the major urban centres of canada are a big reason we have an ongoing class of poor children in our country.there have been similarly good results, for both boys and girls, in public school programs where male and female students have been placed in separate classes.further, daycare centres provide a great, early start for children to develop this skill.by the measure of the fraser institute, we have more than 1.6 million canadians -- hundreds of thousands of whom are children -- living in serious deprivation, conditions which are hazardous for health and development.this makes sense inasmuch as this puts you (and children especially) at a disadvantage in participating in your community and in society.if we are serious about ending poverty, we have to be serious about ending the unjust and violent systems for wealth creation which create poverty by robbing the poor of their resources, livelihoods and incomes.self-sufficiency means you are competing against people who are trying to get money out of you for things you could do just as well or better yourself.quote:quote: the research for the most part suggests children who have been in a daycare setting are often better prepared in terms of social development and beginning literacy and math skills for elementary school.and people in poverty have often experienced some kind of family or community rupture at some point in their lives that made it even more difficult to gain those skills.if we're going to exert all this effort to indoctrinate an inexperienced 18 year old in the idea of borrowing $40-$60k over the next 3-4 years (not counting additional borrowing for post-graduate education), so they can subsize our post-secondary diploma mill (without guaranteeing outcomes), then the least we can do is be honest about expectations and results.they are incarnate problem solvers and hard and capable workers, wherefore they can always find work, degree or no degree.
