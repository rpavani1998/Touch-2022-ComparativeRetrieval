we have a strong and committed sales staff with many years of experience satisfying our customers' needs.the trd off-road package delivers excellent handling on pavement, and it's especially noticeable when tundras so equipped are driven quickly on winding, two-lane roads; the trd sport package does even better if the roads aren't too rough.the available rearview cameras can enhance safety by helping the driver spot children behind the truck when backing up.tundra's 4.6 v8 deserves consideration for general-purpose use where absolute fuel economy nor towing capacity are paramount.the v6 weighs 300 pounds less than do the v8s resulting in better fuel economy.with the seats folded for cargo, the double cab has a significantly lower load height, which should make it easier for canines to get in and out.the 4.0-liter v6 is sufficient for propelling a two-wheel drive tundra and towing a lighter trailer, say 3500 pounds or less, on relatively flat terrain.on the road, power delivery from any tundra engine is linear, and commendably strong at low engine speed.for more severe four-wheel-drive use, the tundra offers decent articulation and good low-range gearing.ford's 5.0-liter delivers considerably more power (360 hp, 380 lb-ft), with similar epa ratings.we find the 5.7-liter v8 a delightful engine, very responsive when quick acceleration is needed, smooth and powerful when cruising.the 5.7-liter has epa fuel-economy ratings of 14/18 mpg city/highway, or 13/17 mpg with 4wd.the 4.6-liter v8 delivers 310 horsepower, 327 pound-feet of torque.a sonar system with an audible warning and an indicator on the dash helps the driver determine the proximity of the front corners to objects when maneuvering in tight quarters, another useful feature when parking this big truck.the rearview camera is valuable for spotting shorter obstacles when backing up because the top of the tailgate towers well above the height of small children, making it an important safety feature.
