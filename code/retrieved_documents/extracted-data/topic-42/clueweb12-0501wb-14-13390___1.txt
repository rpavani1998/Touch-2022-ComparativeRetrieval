ford build quality is good and the car's  reliability record is good.
a four-star ncap result is par for this class,  though a few rivals go one better.
the fiesta was launched as a 2011 model, in both four-door sedan and five-door hatchback models, and has been adapted from the well-received and very popular model sold under the same name in europe, asia, and elsewhere though north american versions offer more standard equipment than fiestas elsewhere in the world.
