“almost all automanufacturers in the past have dropped different brand names and have changed the name of their cars for certain reasons and there is nothing wrong with this being done” correct, except for the fact that competently run companies drop brands that are losing money (as saturn, saab and hummer did for every year of their existence under gm control) , not making it (as oldsmobile and pontiac did for every year of their 106 and 83 year long existences).
an amc pacer… just so i could blow the doors off it as i fly by in my hemi cuda’.
just like honda, they lost to bean counters.
i say this from experience because i work for honda and they unfortunately rebadged the rodeo as a passport.
again it is gm, the product would take a decade to be released and the us probably wouldn’t get it anyway!!!
the earlier ones were supercharged, then they were refreshed with a 260hp(i think) turbo powerplant.
ah, the unmistakable exhaust sound of the gm 3.1l v6.
(i have a my 2000 with almost 100k miles on it, and there’s just no reason to get rid of it) discontinued due to being a 10 year old chassis, but honda dropped the ball by not replacing it.
other forum members listed the buick gnx, fiero gt, last-generation acura tl, 1970 chevelle ss 454 ls6,pontiac g8 gt, 1993-1998 toyota supra, gmc syclone, and 1961lincoln continental, as the cars they would buy if they were still in production.
so guess i’ll change my wants to “2-door suv’s” in general.
i remember getting on to the freeway in seceond about to shift to 3rd when i heard the rumble of the niebhor hood 91 5.0 (sick ass mustang) so i held 2nd to about 8000rpm and never saw the mustang only in my mirrior!!!
pontiac g8 and saturn aura – both solid built and were the reasons why gm could have made them work.
the thing just looks so cool and so rare!
and interestingly, i distinctly recall liberal use of materials that were soft and squishy.
the car was very slender and nice to look at.
i would also show little hesitation towards an ssr.
the tricky part is the original powertrain for me.
air cooled 911s 993 please please bring them back an rx7, soon to be ill fated mazda rx8, lotus elise (soon to be again) pontiac g8, pontiac solstice, saturn sky redline and 71 firebird.
mitsubishi conquest – no i don’t have a year but these were some fast cars for there day.
except those pesky type rs. grammar fail.
but i had a trust intercooler, higher flow injectors, 3inch exhuast, k&n, and really big sticker across the doors (bigger than the doors actually) it said trust.
from the attention to detail, to the futuristic system monitor and trip computer, through the mechanical presets and volvo-esque hollow head restraints, and finally the tire smoking 5 speed stick, this silver 2-door 86 escort gt will always be the car that got me into cars, taught me how to use three pedals before i even much noticed so many cars had two, and served as a reminder during the 90s that american car companies certainly were capable of making a desirable small car.
69- what a nice looking car that doesn’t get all that much attn.
the ’91-’93 beretta gtz was the model with the 190 horsepower quad 4 h.o. lancia stratos or pretty much any rally car that had limited production - first gen. eclipse gsx with the pop up lights - mitsubishi evo
i’d be happy with a 1995-1997 ford probe gt too.
fast forward a few years, and everything rolling out of a final assembly facility was crafted from lego materials inside.
i agree with dougg but i would add the amx and even the gremlin.
lol 1990-1993 acura integra in my opinion its the best car ever made.
anyone who cares enough about the automotive world to get involved with a thread like this should lament both the initial sale of saab to gm, then it’s ignorance in treating the brand like everything else it owned, and then finally trying to both offload it and still control who it goes to to avoid giving up its intellectual property.
we (my wife) owned a pacer which i drove to college for years.
the forgotten little pontiac that is sooo much better than the overated camaro.
the ws6 ram air looked like it would ingest small animals and children as you drove down the road.
of course now it could have the new 5.0 and independent rear suspension.
the more time i get to spend with my cars the more i enjoy them, and that is learning my way around under the hood and on the road.
for that matter compact trucks in general, so sick of the bigger is better bullshit.
gm is giving them away because it wasnt even there money in the first place and since obama had his hands involved in it, im sure lots of people want him to fail.
especially if it had the new v6 and 8 speed tranny.
any of those pink cars that say “mary kay cosmetics sales rep of the year” anything with chrome bumpers.
those cars gave olds a reason to stay around even though the rest of the line up in that era just didn’t make sense.
you went 165 in a car with like 200 hp and a 140 mph speedometer.
i will say that nothing sounds like these old engines, but they just are more trouble then they’re worth for me.
first or second generation miata (bonus points for the mazdaspeed miata).
very nice styling in it’s day, especially if you got an upgraded model.
we all realize the firebird can’t ever make a return so sad….. the 70-74 i thought they were sinister.
i also like crappy cars from the ’80′s that nobody liked then or now, so i’d take a clean, original, low-mileage ’86-’87
integra gsr, toyota mr2 i would buy the sky redline.
ford probe/mazda 626 turbo hatchback i would like the same general styling and modern 4 cylinder turbo engines with 6+ speed dual clutch transmissions.
to be honest the only cars that would sell today are hard core supercars of the day.
ford is not the best, but they turn out the biggest profit out of the relavent car companys, which means people want to buy them for what ford is asking for, and thats not cheap.
1995-1997 geo metro hatchback lsi guys, the honda nsx-r. any amc car.
pontiac g8 mercury marauder plymouth barracuda those cars were awesome, i’d like to drive one.
mercury marauder…..and i dont like alot of what the ford motor co builds…at all, 89 – 94 nissan maxima…the last great real 4 door sports car…in addition the engines run forever.
i’m glad i had that memory to hold onto while scoffing at the automotive excrement that dropped into dealerships for 15 years until so recently.
de-contented it and wrecked what they had and although i totally loved the rx7 twin turbo reliability would atop me from putting it here as well as the sc400 however way too many dash light issues that cost us money also stops that.
huge and flamboyant by today’s (dull) standards, but a perfect antidote to all the “taller than they are long” clown cars out there now.
very arrogant to assume that manufacturers the world over want to get their hands on cutting edge gm technology, and would rather buy a worthwhile brand for millions of dollars than stroll into a gm dealer and just buy one or two cars to disassemble.
they’re nothing special, but i still dig them.
oldsmobiles 60-77 – again they were at the top of there game when the gm divisions were seperately ran.
mitsubishi 3000gt haha chevy el camino, these were just plain cool and had something small trucks just don’t have… a v-8 and some sense of rebelliousness s2000 – hands down!
nothing in the potential sale could have given a buyer what they couldn’t have found out for themselves- or already knew.
i trusted that i could be just about any car!!!
but i live in a rhd country and it was never sold here so i can only look at pictures.
my girlfriend’s dad had a nissan with voice, “door is ajar”.
i remember being in an altima in the early 90′s and thinking, damn this is a nice car.
my ls and gs were better commuting cars 1998-2001 rally blue subie impreza coupe (gold wheels of course) 1970 buick gsx, 2002 dakota with either the 4.7, or 5.9 v8.
pontiac g-6 1969 – 1970 ford galaxie 500 xl 2 door coupe i would buy the honda s2000.
yeah, like the car you chose, oh wait, you didn’t give one.
bailouts that did nothing to address their myriad labor and management issues), not because of it.
it looked like we were towing a greenhouse (she loaded it with house plants).
motor trend forum member 400calvin says his favorite car built was the second-generationhonda crx si.
and that the car can still get me someplace in an emergency.
it had a/c, a trip computer, a system function test with little lightbulbs on a graphic that could tell you if any light was burned out, 15″ aluminum wheels, a 5 speed stick, and some of the coolest seats and trim i’ve seen.
very different and destined to be a collecters item i would add the studebaker avanti supercharge nice pick; great car suprised nobody has mentioned the mitsu 300gt vr-4, or dodge stealth.
the sheer stupidity and utter incompetence of gm’s executives is shown by the fact that in both 2004 (when oldsmobile got the ax ) and 2009 (when they did in the proud indian), the division they were killing had never lost money, while the three divisions they kept (saab, saturn and hummer) had never made money under gm management.
enough room in the bed for all my tools and more horsepower than i could ever need.
owned one, nothing like a car you can (or have to), press the pedal all the way down every time you drive it…not the coolest, but reminds you how far you’ve come.
they let production run until updated government safety measurements meant honda had to put development dollars into the car, and the plug was pulled.
i thought the ws6 was so cool when it first came out, i stil think its awesome.
alfa romeo brera v6, the only way to petrolhead heaven.
if i could change only the engine to anything i wanted and keep everything else the same, it would be.. 86 buick gnx (fit in ford’s 3.5l ecoboost)
still looks modern today, despite being over 10 years old now.
keep it pithy, and people will listen.
400calvin only has three stipulations: the car can no longer be in production and it must have the same styling and powertrain offered when originally built.
motor trend forum member 400calvin says his favorite car built was the second-generationhonda crx si.
subaru impreza 2011 bmw 1 series m 2010 bmw m3 wow acura lineup really went downhill.
celica gt has 2.2 liter, not 2.0.
2006 pontiac gto with all the extras.
nissans of that era were very well engineered.
acura integra r. also, happy not many new detroit cars are sold on the east coast.

nobody ask for your not only stupid ass comment but incorrect either, and brand dropping is what happens when you go bankrupt.
what a great time to have a japanese import, they had great style and were so much fun to drive.
caillac sedan deville , thought the car was just perfect in every way.
focus, but if that escort was available new (only assuming that safety and convenience items were kept current)
the tech would now cheap therfore people would by it.
one of the most underrated car companies that attributed so many breakthroughs to the automotive industry.
land rover evoque is awesome…except it’s way too expensive for the general public.
the entire upper dash was a vinyl coated foam pad, and the graining was impressive.
as far as a modded gst not being able to keep up with a type r..well thats just rediculous.
i like so many icons already mentined, but i don’t like their old engines, because they are weak, and many have carboraters, and i’m not wasting my time with those.
everyone gets so angry about other peoples opinoin.
i love camaros as well, and chevy in general.
until, this day, you still see grand am’s all over driving down the road with hundreds of thousands of miles on them.
nice tight gaps in the body, solid sounding doors, clean interiors.
the rodeo was a terrible truck (gasket leaks galore and rusty frames).
thanks for sticking with me, i hope my little ballad of escort gt love has sparked a memory or stirred up your own emotions over your first car love affair.
1970-76 dodge crestwood station wagon – i just remember how looked i thought they were cool.
gm counted 1,285,820 vehicles sold by saic-wuling that gm didn’t have a controlling interest in, didn’t design, and didn’t produce.
then they were turbocharged with 260 hp.
they were very capable, and gave the feeling of a full-size/safe vehicle in a much more compact/shorter length.
looks like gm is doing something right.
plus i’m sure with modern technology – weight saving materials and more efficient engines – they should be able to muster some better gas
studebaker hawk is my pick i don’t like making mistakes in my spelling so *opinion cars i could afford- - e46 330i with zhp pkg (can’t believe noone mentioned this, one of bmw’s best cars ever) - e46 m3 coupe 6-sp - e34 m5 - g8 gxp - 2007 350z grand touring - 2003-04 svt cobra - first gen usdm sti - mkiv r32 wishful thinking- - nsx (’01 or newer) - 993 c2s, turbo, rs and gt2 - 360 modena challenge stradale - ford gt - carrera gt - diablo sv ’99-’02 toyota celica.
it was an amazing roadster, gm shouldnt have killed off saturn.
reading the first few lines made my brain hurt.
i enjoy tinkering with cars, i just want to make sure i’m not spending all my time and money on it to do it.
i loved the boxy look, standard fox racing fog lights, and the seat fabric and trim to name a few reasons to buy.
he thought its size, styling, and powertrain were the perfect blend of performance and style for him—especially in red and black with mag wheels and a sunroof.
i learned to drive on my dads 2-door 86 escort gt.
it was silver metallic with black lower skirt and sills.
i know i could write for days about that car, but i won’t do it here for your sake.
news flash: car companies buy competitors products ad tear them apart all the time.
the fact gm is still selling vehicles and making profits is in spite of gm management (with a little help from govco.
twin turbo 75-76 caddy coupe deville 77-78 ford thunderbird gas would kill me in the last two and they would not fit in my garage with that length.
it’s the perfect idea for honda to find its roots.

mitsubishi … the one before the eclipse 89-94 they were small cars with turbos and these little s.o.b.s blew the doors off of mustangs camaros and pretty much anything come in there crosshairs.
so as i think back to what made me into the stick-driving, car loving guy i am today, i realize it was influenced a lot by my parents (both of whom are into cars) and this escort in particular.
even with +270k on the odometer and 4 out of 5 gears she still punk ass civic hatch owners in their place.
i’ll miss seeing a new saab soon, whenever i realize a new one should have been rolling out and isn’t.
i could care less what you think.
one of many stupid moves the gm “brand management” idiots inflicted on pontiac before they pulled the plug was changing the name of their sporty mid sizes to the moronic g6 (for the grand am) and the g8 (for the grand prix as well as the full size bonneville) .
maximas back then were true affordable luxury.
the lower door panel continued the high-pile carpet up about 8 inches from the bottom, and the whole door panel itself was covered in padded vinyl.
more than half of gm’s claimed sales in china were actually non-gm small delivery vans built by saic-wuling, the chinese state-owned company that gm has a partnership with.
an amc pacer…as a deserving present to 11secjeepsrt8.
i liked toyota mr2 & mazda mx-3.
i know but i’d love to have either a manual equiped ssr or ram srt-10 for my paintless dent repair buisness.
it had ford premium sound (lol) but what was impressive was that it had a head unit with mechanical tuning dials… and mechanical presets.
in a heartbeat, i would buy a monte carlo (or regal/rivera) if it came back out today.
buicks from 65-71 – they were just classy man had terrific lines and interiors were interesting.
400calvin only has three stipulations: the car can no longer be in production and it must have the same styling and powertrain offered when originally built.
gm is barely even making there money back on there investments, we’re talking less than .01% profit, compared to the money they invested.
looking back, i realize my dad was driving one of the first hot hatches, and i still remember it as a hoot.
lmao i have owned 4 da integras.my 92 and 93 gsr’s were awesome.the only thing i didnt like was 4k rpms at 60 mph in top gear.
i don’t think we need to go back to the fifties per se, i’d just like to see the word “proportion” come back into designer’s vocabularies.
