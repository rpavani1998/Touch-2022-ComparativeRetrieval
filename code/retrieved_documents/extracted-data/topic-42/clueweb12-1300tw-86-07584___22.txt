looks pretty sharp, and that  interior seems pretty fantastic.
nothing like a huge, undulating gap in body panels to scream  quality.
huge improvement, i must say.
am wife and i love it!
cp_09malibuv6 - 04/04/12 07:15 am i like how this design wont overshadow the handsome new malibu, the way  the new malibu makes the cruze look cheaper by comparison.

the designers really hit one out of the park.
i give it an exuberant... 'meh.'
click to view gallery gm says the new impala’s stronger structure enhances the quietness of the full-size sedan’s passenger compartment, and improves the handling and ride.
it is an extremely nice car and sounds great with a huge  lump of snarling iron under the hood, but it is by no means fast.
laserwizard - 04/04/12 01:18
seriously looking into replacing her malibu with an impala instead of the new malibu.
it would be even better if it was rwd.
the long, raked-back profile is meant to pay homage to past impalas, while still providing a contemporary look.
mustang fanboys  probably don't like it bc it resembles the camaro.
jgf1031 - 04/04/12 04:35
variaban - 04/04/12 08:06 am looks much better than the model it replaces.
what's with the  freaky-deaky hood?
the people  who buy this car not only do not care if it is fwd, rwd, or awd, they likely do  not know the difference.
nicombobula - 04/04/12 02:12 pm people this does not look like an azera!!!
syj -  04/04/12 12:23 pm reading through the comments you can see who is being  realistic and honest and who is offering mindless impala bashing.
roadmastah - 04/04/12 07:22
capitals - 03/29/12 02:08 pm a 5.3 i don't think so
as someone else stated these new grills for the impala and traverse seem to be for their upper class models however if you look at least on the impala it has two bars in the grill symbolizing the single bar found on chevys.
although i do suspect that chevy will raise the price some on this car, i hope they don't raise it too much.
front-wheel drive is for bargain, commuter cars, nothing more.
the 4-cylinder engines, especially with the power outputs currently sited, have no place in the automobile of this size and legendary status.

the general expects the 2.4-liter eassist model to be epa-rated at 35 mpg on the highway.
pm would be far better it came  with a v-8 and rear drive.
am looks better  then the its twins buick lacrosse and cadillac xts.
the door panels and dashboard get soft-touch materials, while the seats are meant to look more premium than the old model with higher-quality stitching.
cars3 - yesterday 09:29 am this 2013 chevrolet impala is so hot!!
looks like some kind of california  ghetto carpeted dash cover you buy from jc whitney for $39.
am it's a huge  improvement over the current impala, but the 2013 ford fusion still looks  better.
i'm not a fan of the looks like it should have been on a  2nd gen. hhr rear quarter, but otherwise this is huge improvement styling wise  over any post '72 impala.
appears to be a huge leap forward from the "current" model.
the only models that had any kind of acceleration were the ss  models and even then they weren't really speed demons.
i do however wonder what the advantage of eassist is when the normal 4-banger will produce more hp and similar fuel economy numbers in the real world.
pm this is the  best fwd impala yet, and as far as being reliable, efficient transportation, is  the best impala ever.
wow, i hate to say that i'm surprised, but i  am!
throttleblip -  04/03/12 11:24 pm kinda like the design.
i  dont care how many current impalas are sold to rental agencies, this one looks  good.
lay off the sauce name  one car in this segment that has a more masculine front end.
machinereplica - 04/04/12 03:41 am to anyone who says the  early impalas of the 60's were anything more than all show and no go are  ridiculous.
so there you have it: a wonderfully styled  car...
lasvegascolonel - 04/04/12 12:35 pm having lived through the great impalas that were large cars, v8s, stylish, coupes, and breathtaking in many ways, i wouldn't normally praise these kid hauler impalas (sedans), but this is nicely styled and i would consider this over a more bland camry or accord.
old hyundai front, current sides and back.
the new impala has some mighty big shoes to fill, and will very likely be the  best fwd impala yet.
am i like the  camaro-esque front.
am nice new toyota, you guys at g.m.!
pmirp1 - 04/04/12 02:54
a long greenhouse area accentuates the impala’s sleek profile, and finally comes to a point at the rear quarter window, which terminates right before the impala emblem on the rear panel.
and what's with that dash pad?
skyguy - 04/04/12 11:01
am @connermt the fusion, accord,  camry, passat, and altima are not in the impala's class,they compete with the  malibu.
i hope to see a little refinement.
tibbz - 04/04/12 06:30
see how much you can save!
just happy usa back  in the game go gm and ford!
a central 4.2-inch color display within the wraparound instrument cluster relays the driver information, while an 8-inch touch screen with a hidden storage compartment behind it adorns the center stack.
i haven't heard of that being a widespread issue, but i would hope for better materials and build quality.
or should i say impasat?
am and please tell me why this is not a direct  competitor with the malibu.
appears to be a huge leap forward from the  "current" model.
it's a great looking car.
it looks like they glued doilies  randomly all over it.
this isn't a dig on the  old impalas, i just think people are reaching a bit here and just remember the  old impalas as better than they really were.
upgrayedd -  yesterday 12:37
i just saw a new malibu at the local chevy dealer.
gm  should have re-badged the pontiac g8 (australian muscle car) for the impala  replacement.
maybe one of there new small blocks there working on, or a turbo/supercharged  v-6.

i wasn't expecting anything this nice.
pm think it  has been improved and agree some of the design is busy.
it is an extremely nice car and sounds great with a huge lump of snarling iron under the hood, but it is by no means fast.
well, hertz, avis and budget just soiled their skivvies.
again chevy is making the impala to compete and not dominate.
gm could have done a better job on the dash pad, it appears to be an afterthought.
in fact malibu's shouldn't have  only 4 cylinders only either.
the exterior is attractive, the interior offers more than any of its competitors, and that is all it will take to attract buyers.
i hope they have an awd drive  option.
hate to see a nice design get watered down like that.
but overall i do like the design.
it does look more like a buick-wannabe or hyundai than a chevy, but lately, that's been a good thing.
i hope it does'nt have the cave type of appearance of the lacrosse in  person and that if in the drivers seat one has good visiblility all around.
if this car falls in  the league of toyota avalon & ford taurus, then the new 2013 ford taurus is  tighter, cohesive and better looking car.
poplifedc - 04/04/12 08:51
am @psycowboy: badge engineering?
rangeroller - 04/04/12 07:38
i  think gm has created another huge improvement in its line up.
the new impala adds 1.2 inches to its wheelbase, though overall dimensions don’t change much (0.9 inches longer, 0.1 inches wider, and 0.2 inches taller.)
given the heritage that the impala has, where is there any originality in this?
this car is clearly full sized in terms of space.
the steering wheel and back end are disappointing though  considering how good looking the rest is.
its a huge step up in the styling dept from the  invisible 9th gen impala but whats with the 3 creases in the rear door?!
am is it me or  does the rear 3/4 view looks exactly like that of the hyundai sonata pennrck22  - 04/04/12 09:46
it's light years ahead of the current generation in design: as in, there is some design.
the interior looks great and the front end is ok but the rear door just looks awful.
looks like some kind of california ghetto carpeted dash cover you buy from jc whitney for $39.
like the side profile
i dont understand why people think that rwd is the main reason for the success of the chrysler lx cars.
not even in the same solar system as this  car.
like it or not, at least they're  trying.
at first i thought wow nice than i thought, again not the car i was hoping it would turn out to be not edgey enough.
i just  dont think that moter will have the power to pull this car around, they might  want to add a blower to that motor to make it relevent.
more from aol autos • gps tracking devices warrant fears •
connermt - 04/04/12 08:03 am not crazy about the rear end, but leaps and bounds ahead of the current model in terms of design.
way too busy in my opinion.
whoever thinks  this is ugly has no clue what they are talking about.
sure, its based on the lacrosse platform, but very much a  different animal.
sami_sa1 -  04/04/12 12:51 pm is this car is designed by a designer who works for kia/  hyundai and who is impressed by audi a7 rear end?
what's really impressive about '65 to '70 full size chevrolets isn't their  impressive acceleration capability when equipped with upper tier v8's (325  horsepower and up), but their modern road manners, especially when equipped  with the optional after '67 front disc brakes and accompanying 15 inch wheels.
the platform-mate lacrosse eassist is rated at 25/36 mpg city/highway – expect similar numbers from the 2014 impala.
and the price will likely move closer to $30k to start.
inyurahsya - 04/04/12 12:08 pm it looks like a 4-door camaro with the rear of a cruze.
at  first i thought wow nice than i thought, again not the car i was hoping it  would turn out to be not edgey enough.
weird to keep the 2.4l around unless it's a tooling / cost saving issue to continue stamping out the inferior 2.4l. hopefully that's a mistake in the article or the 2.5l will be used later in the year or 2014 (2015 model).
am at first i was kind of polarized by this car but its  growing on me!
i dont  understand why people think that rwd is the main reason for the success of the  chrysler lx cars.
am i stopped reading
those direct-injection engines include a 2.4-liter i-4 with eassist mild hybrid technology, estimated to produce 182 hp and 172 lb-ft of torque; a 2.5-liter ecotec i-4 estimated at 195 hp and 187 lb-ft; and the familiar 3.6-liter v-6 producing 303 hp and 264 lb-ft.
i'm not a fan of the looks like it should have been on a 2nd gen. hhr rear quarter, but otherwise this is huge improvement styling wise over any post '72 impala.
i'm still not a fan of chevy tan and brown interiors and  their tacky "ambient lighting" but i'd say that the avalon and azera  has their work cut out for them.
the cafe regs are making cars lame again  like they did in the late 1970's.
am i'm really  diging this car.

pm would be far better it came with a v-8 and rear drive.
those are probably the closest, though they're rwd.
this will retain it's title as the fleet queen.
the  rest looks pretty good and it's definitely different.
this is my second sub 14 second '68 full size chevrolet, the other being  a 385 horsepower 427 bel air that was a couple of tenths slower (13.2) than the  l79, but had it covered on the mph side of the time slip (110-112>105-108).
this looks nothing like xts or lacrosse inside and  out.
nah, it's interior doesn't look as good.
dmadam - yesterday  08:33 am until they go rear wheel drive its just another failed gm  imitation of what it used to be.
2.5 good for malibu, bad for impala.
aeroknight29 - 04/04/12 08:33
gm’s collision mitigation braking system – another chevy first – can apply the brakes automatically if a crash is imminent.
redvette77 - 04/04/12 05:56 am this.
gm should have re-badged the pontiac g8 (australian muscle car) for the impala replacement.
xts has v6 only and offers awd.
machinereplica - 04/04/12 03:41 am to anyone who says the early impalas of the 60's were anything more than all show and no go are ridiculous.
your eyes  must all be broken for real.
, stunning car, i love the sharp crease at the rear.
and i can only assume they will offer an upcoming  twin-turbo v6 when ready, the lesser one i assume would be enough.
the people who buy this car not only do not care if it is fwd, rwd, or awd, they likely do not know the difference.
i  thought the 2.5l replaces it in a few months.
i believe the taurus, avalon, cc, and maxima compete with the  impala.
mh_5 - 04/04/12 03:12 pm finally an impala with some  substance!
their space, value and style is what people like- most folks  could care less about rwd.
it wont be compared to midsizers.
great lines, great details, great  wheels.
i know the new impala will have some major technological advancements inside and out - i just hope it doesn't look too much like the camaro or the new bu... t2mgb18 - 04/02/12 11:47
leaps and bounds  better than the tired model its replacing though.
c6vette -  04/04/12 06:02
impala's shouldn't have 4 cylinders, it just is too small for a car that size.
someone mentioned the azera- the hyundai is attractive but still  derivative of existing asian luxury cars.
seems like to me that gm is trying to protect  the sales of the more expensive models based on this platform - the buick  lacrosse and cadillac xts.
the rest of the interior is well done though.
it almost seems to me that  chevrolet might be creating a two-tier lineup.
variaban - 04/04/12 08:06 am looks much better than the model it  replaces.

where as the split grill will be for the more “economical” vehicles.
35mpg is good though for such a large  car.
adamlink - 04/04/12 06:03 am
the new impala has some mighty big shoes to fill, and will very likely be the best fwd impala yet.
lets have some of it back!
this isn't a dig on the old impalas, i just think people are reaching a bit here and just remember the old impalas as better than they really were.
i can't think of any non-gm car in this class that looks this good:
am this model is a step in the right direction for the impala.
to all of you saying it looks like an azera?
it's still a pretty  vanilla-looking car (not really a deal-killer considering how bland its closest  competitors all look), but i admit it looks gorgeous when compared to the  outgoing impala.
im thinking a loaded ltz will be around $38k.
pm it looks like it should be  rwd.
anyways, i hope they do not do that to the impala... seano0 - 04/01/12  07:50 pm
why so big and flat in the center?
looks like it should be rwd.
this looks nothing like xts or lacrosse inside and out.
g.m. used to have brilliant styling....lets have some of it back!
am i can't wait for the 2014 chevrolet impala, this should  be a fantastic car.
those headlamps feature hids on the ltz model, along with led daytime running lights.
its fresh looking and graceful.
pm beautiful re-design, both inside and out.
click to view gallery
the efforts by manufacturers to compensate for the idiotic cafe regulations by the obozo administration have been tried before....with disastrous results.
am not a bad looking car inside and out, but mostly targeted at the rentals, and  the ford taurus and avalons of the world.
what's really impressive about '65 to '70 full size chevrolets isn't their impressive acceleration capability when equipped with upper tier v8's (325 horsepower and up), but their modern road manners, especially when equipped with the optional after '67 front disc brakes and accompanying 15 inch wheels.
4 cylinder engines in large cars are not a good idea, not matter how stressed you make them.
it's still america's bread-n-butter sedan, and has been for decades.
it's still a pretty vanilla-looking car (not really a deal-killer considering how bland its closest competitors all look), but i admit it looks gorgeous when compared to the outgoing impala.
bigdogdiesel - 04/04/12 12:23 am
i liked it in pictures but in person it looked terrible.
i am impressed  with the look of this car.
the curves and bulging fenders are a long way from the old slab-sided design language.
35mpg is good though for such a large car.
with engineering choices not made by the bean-counters of old...but the political officers of the new regime.
current car tops out around $31k or so.
weird to keep the 2.4l around unless  it's a tooling / cost saving issue to continue stamping out the inferior 2.4l.   hopefully that's a mistake in the article or the 2.5l will be used later  in the year or 2014 (2015 model).
this much improved interior and new found style should increase retail customer percentage.
your eyes must all be broken for real.
this looks way to much like a toyota.
explore your financing options!
g.m. used to have brilliant  styling....
ejd1984  - 04/04/12 08:14
this isn't mindless impala bashing - it is an honest assessment of a product that just doesn't work as it is offered.
i dont care how many current impalas are sold to rental agencies, this one looks good.
malibu uses the 2.4l only because the 2.5l was not yet ready, but next year all malibus will use the 2.5l, so why not the impala in 2013?
gm is addressing that issue in the new model by employing high-quality fabrics, ultrasuede, and perforated leather inside the cabin of the 2014 impala.
dhan219 - 04/04/12 01:05
there's only two things i don't like  about it-
insulting this car because the current 7 year old car is a rental favorite is stupid.
i think gm has created another huge improvement in its line up.
feel as though its lost its sporty/athletic look in favor of a more premium look.
i actually like it better than anything ive seen from them.
didn't we learn anything?
am and please tell me why this is not a direct competitor with the malibu.
taurus, 300, charger, azera,  avalon?
i wonder how much of this styling will influence the rumored chevrolet ss/chevelle/caprice sedan.
but seriously, who cross shops impala's with anything in it's class?
gm says the system’s appearance in the 2014 impala will mark its first use in a chevy model.
the impala now comes standard with 18-inch wheels (steel or alloy, depending on trim), with 19- and 20-inch alloys available.
dhan219 - yesterday 05:40
i think it is a fantastic looking car, and compared to the old impala, this car is considerably better on looks alone.
this new grill styling, along with the traverse, will be for the chevrolet “premium” models.
auto loan quote want to save money on your next auto purchase?
the steering wheel and back end are disappointing though considering how good looking the rest is.
posted 4 hours days ago | comments (1) -
this isnt being  designed as a rental car first.
but this looks much more expensive than it will be.
so we now have a chevy cc, i  understand the v6 and the semi-hyrbrid, but wtf is with that normal 2.5?
plus, gm's powertrain warranty matches chrysler's...better than ford or toyota.
am since when did gm figure out that it's okay to make an attractive impala?
a wide grille is front and center, framed by a pair of low-profile projector headlamps which sweep around the corners of the front end.
still, leaps and bounds better than the current car.
am hope there is an impala supersport in  the works to square off against the taurus sho, bring back the 5.3 ss version  with awd
pm great looking car from the outside.
i think it looks nicer on the outside than the taurus, but comes short of the azera on the inside and out.
the v6s are what people buy anyway, not the hemi models.

but will they be enough to challenge other full-sizers like the toyota avalon, hyundai azera, and chrysler 300?
i am really impressed with this car, and i'm sure it looks even better in person.
wheres the originality!?
psycowboy - 04/04/12 03:21

it's still america's bread-n-butter  sedan, and has been for decades.
the value of the impala  has always been very strong!!!!
it is an improvement over the last one, but it's nothing special.
it looks like they glued doilies randomly all over it.
glad that they kept the 3.6ltr.
it's always been cross shopped with midsizers like the malibu,  fusion, camry, etc... maybe this new model will finally let it step up  to other competitors in it's intended class 92vectra1.6i - 04/04/12
when i  glanced at the picture on the main page i instantly thought it was a new  passat.
a little more "oomph" (30+hp and lots of torque) from the electric motor would be nice though in such a large car.

i see a really ugly honda not a chevy... mixed news with  this one, needs an ss model and all wheel drive to battle the ford sho.
it  does look more like a buick-wannabe or hyundai than a chevy, but lately, that's  been a good thing.
i really wanted to like the impala, mainly because of the late 80's, early 90's ones (exc. 91-93)
toycrusher - 04/04/12 04:58 am first decent looking impala in years.
" nonetheless, they'll sell a ton of these to police departments, rental car companies, and gm fans.
am this car will have the 2.5l and the e-assist system.
this new grill styling, along  with the traverse, will be for the chevrolet “premium” models.
am a decent efforts that reminds me of a  cross between a camaro and charger that got dialed back a bit.
a nice thick, leather wrapped wheel with a simple three spoke design and tasteful metal accenting.

even more comforting than the design is  the fact that the malibu and impala finally do not overlap.
a nice thick, leather wrapped wheel with a simple  three spoke design and tasteful metal accenting.
whoever thinks this is ugly has no clue what they are talking about.
i really thought that lutz would've been able to pull it off; the trimming down, and building up of a truly competitive american brand.
(http://image.automotive.com/f/2008_saturn_vue/2308203520936955304+w500/steering-wheel.jpg) other than, i think this car will perform well in the sales department.
great combination for the road warriors that want good comfortable reliable transportation with some power.
@toycrusher: the current car is barely full sized.
dealer pricing research & reviews loan quote insurance rates page tools print share email rss april 03, 2012 by alex nishimoto tweet | a staple of rental car fleets across america, the current-generation chevy impala is anything but an object of desire.
but with the all-new 2014 chevrolet impala making its world debut at the 2012 new york auto show, the bow tie brand is promising to erase memories of the long-running nameplate’s largely forgettable outgoing model with a more refined interior, the latest in technology, and a vastly improved driving experience when it goes on sale in early 2013.
i really think the designers of this slept with the  designers of the new avalon ( and, maybe the azera, as well)  this looks   way to much like a toyota.
redvette77 - 04/04/12 03:26 pm everyone seems to be missing the same thing.
i just  am disappointed in the rear again.
just happy usa back in the game go gm and ford!
i  see this as being a huge sales success soon after hitting the market.
they could have easily done something like a 65 impala rear tail lights.
cause you may as well say the same about the accord too if youre gonna say that.
for sure, it's  nothing like the real impalas that were large, held six adults, v8s, coupes,  and stylish from years ago, but for a family that needs 4 doors to cart people  around, it should do ok.
and the price will likely  move closer to $30k to start.
and we have just been told that front end was for the trucks....
shaking that rental car image will take some time, but these changes could go a long way in earning the nameplate back some of its lost prestige.
on top of that, none of the three cars have the exact same powertrains  choices.
this much improved  interior and new found style should increase retail customer percentage.
anyways, i hope they do not do that to the impala... seano0 - 04/01/12 07:50 pm it would be huge for gm to offer this in awd.
to be honest, full sized sedans should not have such weak power-trains to began with in 2012.
surprised no one else has said anything.
the impala rides on a macpherson-strut front suspension and four-link rear independent suspension, and has its front cradle isolated from the rest of the car by way of a hydraulic ride bushing.
bring over  the v-8 holden, you cowardly jackwads.
i hope they have an awd drive option.
annassie32 - 04/04/12 08:04 am
through this touch screen, drivers can interface with chevy’s available mylink system, which incorporates bluetooth hands-free phone and streaming audio, plus optional navigation.
sccardriver - 04/04/12 11:23 am this car is a much larger car than the new malibu is.
this car is going to be much more expensive with all the bells and whistles and its brand new.
jimmytheg - 04/04/12  01:45 pm
cars3 - yesterday 09:29 am this  2013 chevrolet impala is so hot!!
the 4-cylinder engines, especially with the power outputs  currently sited, have no place in the automobile of this size and legendary  status.
i wish gm would've taken a similar design and built upon it for this car
like it or not, at least they're trying.
i think it is a  fantastic looking car, and compared to the old impala, this car is considerably  better on looks alone.
this thing is all its own your brain is lying to you side by side pictures of what youre saying it looks like and youll feel stupid capitals - 04/04/12 01:46 pm overall a nice car inside/outside, but the four cylinders, i don't know maybe the turbo with 270hp will be okay in this car.
jimmytheg - 04/04/12 01:45 pm
a hodgepodge of gm designs.
syj - 04/04/12 12:23 pm reading through the comments you can see who is being realistic and honest and who is offering mindless impala bashing.
overall, minus the ugly steering wheel, an incredible design masterpiece easily erasing the current impala from my mind..heres to hoping for an awd ss model!!
block - 04/04/12 05:51
inyurahsya - 04/04/12 12:08 pm it looks like a 4-door camaro with the  rear of a cruze.
the v6s are what people buy anyway, not the hemi  models.
ya'll must be blind.
there is nothing original here.
given the heritage that the impala has,  where is there any originality in this?
looks pretty sharp, and that interior seems pretty fantastic.
unless its rear  drive, itll never perform like those two.
all our car data at your fingertips.
am @psycowboy: badge  engineering?
at least this impala would  easily fit in the garage unlike the old ones.
i  just read on another website that awd will not be offered on the impala.
i'd take a new fusion any day over this.
the steering wheel looks like the ones in some mercedes, two:  it's not a rwd.
am i hope the rear is not some iteration  of the camaro rear.
cars3 - 04/01/12 09:39
am i hope the rear is not some iteration of the camaro rear.
2.5 good for  malibu, bad for impala.
although the photos depict a loaded ltz, it looks as though chevy may have gotten this one right for a change.
the all-new 2014 chevrolet  impala is unveiled in this video...
look at compeitors like the taurus and the passat.
bring over the v-8 holden, you cowardly jackwads.
unless its rear drive, itll never perform like those two.
it's light years ahead of the current generation in  design: as in, there is some design.
i see this as being a huge sales success soon after hitting the market.
the hood gets a slight power bulge, intended to convey a look of performance.
the regular 2.4l is being phased out.
i think it is the best looking front wheel drive sedan under  40.
glad they are sticking with the 3.6 engine.
i mean hello they did a great job making the camaro!
jackal119 -  04/04/12 05:13
but again, another brick from gm.
i believe the taurus, avalon, cc, and maxima compete with the impala.
i would have left the instrument cluster hood the same color as the rest of the dash, but other than those two things, this car looks great.
i at least had hope...a front wheel drive impala only conveys to the suspense-held public what everyone feared; that absolutely nothing has changed.
the cafe regs are making cars lame again like they did in the late 1970's.
the steering wheel looks like the ones in some mercedes, two: it's not a rwd.
cp_09malibuv6 - 04/04/12 07:15 am i like how this design wont overshadow the handsome new malibu, the way the new malibu makes the cruze look cheaper by comparison.
this isnt being designed as a rental car first.
pm why must chevy take design cues from other chevy models in their lineup and  incorporate them in a "redesigned" model?
either way the impala looks good, the interior in the 9th generation was horrible, the 8th gen was better.
this is my second sub 14 second '68 full size chevrolet, the other being a 385 horsepower 427 bel air that was a couple of tenths slower (13.2) than the l79, but had it covered on the mph side of the time slip (110-112>105-108).
chevrolet needs to offer a turbo 4 cylinder with about 240 horsepower and more importantly, at least 250 lb-ft. with a goal of 35 mpg highway.
looks good, but there's no flare like the impala has.
throttleblip - 04/04/12 11:28 am car looks great but the ugly steering  wheel looks just like the terrible unit found in the current gen mercedes  s-class.
am looks better then the its twins buick lacrosse and cadillac xts.
i can't help but notice how much it looks like the current azera  though.. almost like they had the azera on hand when they were designing this  car.
and how about that dashboard?
it doesn't worry the chrysler  twins (300 and charger) one bit.
i hope chevy comes out with an awd version, that would be pretty  cool.
am i stopped reading once i got to "the car will be offered exclusively in front-wheel drive..." wake me up from this nightmare when gm decides to make it rwd.
am can't believe i am saying this, but it really looks handsome.....
if this car falls in the league of toyota avalon & ford taurus, then the new 2013 ford taurus is tighter, cohesive and better looking car.
92vectra1.6i - 04/04/12 03:36
i think it looks  nicer on the outside than the taurus, but comes short of the azera on the  inside and out.
it would be great if an ss version with a strong v-8 would also be offered  in the future.
himoses - 04/04/12 08:40
other safety features include forward collision alert, lane departure warning, side blind zone alert, and rear cross traffic alert, which use either radar or cameras to detect various hazards and alert the driver.
a rwd car would of sealed the deal.
wrong nothing like it, the passat even more wrong a cc at best closest resembles this.
this car is great  and its a huge step forward for the impala and its one step closer to  greatness.
(http://image.automotive.com/f/2008_saturn_vue/2308203520936955304+w500/steering-wheel.jpg) other than, i think this car will perform well in the sales  department.
fwd not a bother since itll be the wifes car..
4 cylinder engines in large cars are not a  good idea, not matter how stressed you make them.
the 10th-generation impala is based on a stretched version of gm’s epsilon ii platform, which also underpins the cadillac xts and buick lacrosse.
overall,  minus the ugly steering wheel, an incredible design masterpiece easily erasing  the current impala from my mind..heres to hoping for an awd ss model!!
but this  looks way more manly than a 300, avalon, taurus, or maxima ryandarr1979 -  04/04/12 03:58
i believe styling is behind 2013 malibu just like taurus is behind 2013 fusion.
one of the previous impala’s biggest trouble spots was its low-rent interior.
i actually like it better than  anything ive seen from them.
the only thing i don't like is the steering wheel,  which has always been a problem for gm.
since an ss would need the (developing) 3.6l twin-turbo, and awd to handle the power.
so there you have it: a wonderfully styled car...
golf clap for chevy.... bhallais - 04/04/12 06:21
sccardriver -  04/04/12 11:23 am this car is a much larger car than the new malibu is.
but the ride will say more.
surprised no  one else has said anything.
but this looks much more  expensive than it will be.
lord  knows i love an ls-x over just about anything.
fwd and sick, wheezy  little engines tugging around 2 tons of flab.
fwd and sick, wheezy little engines tugging around 2 tons of flab.
or even the v6 charger (a  stretch, but at least the impala could be mentioned in the same breath, unlike  if it's fwd only).
plus, gm's powertrain warranty matches  chrysler's...better than ford or toyota.
tina_dang - 04/04/12 07:23
i loved the rear lights on the 00-05 impala.
the interior is original  and looks great, but can we please get rid of akerson now for what he's doing  to gmdesign?
sure, its based on the lacrosse platform, but very much a different animal.
although the photos  depict a loaded ltz, it looks as though chevy may have gotten this one right  for a change.
am i'm really diging this car.
the current impala is built  okay, but its interior on one of my relative's 2009 is already falling apart.
i really thought that lutz would've been able to pull it off; the  trimming down, and building up of a truly competitive american brand.
it would be great if an ss version with a strong v-8 would also be offered in the future.
ibx1 - 04/04/12 05:46
or even the v6 charger (a stretch, but at least the impala could be mentioned in the same breath, unlike if it's fwd only).
oh what a brave new world. bowery01 -  yesterday 07:21 pm what is up with the curly q over the back wheel?
i will echo everybody else's sentiments concerning the steering wheel.
am nice new toyota,  you guys at g.m.!
it just doesn't work - some colors make this thing look profoundly cheap.
i'm still not a fan of chevy tan and brown interiors and their tacky "ambient lighting" but i'd say that the avalon and azera has their work cut out for them.
the only thing i don't  like is that steering wheel.
vertigo5110 - today 08:10 am i think anybody still hoping/praying for rwd on this car is kidding themselves.
toycrusher -  04/04/12 04:58 am first decent looking impala in years.
redvette77 -  04/04/12 03:26 pm everyone seems to be missing the same thing.
looks like a cheap korean ripoff of a toyota camry - the interior is more mishmash of design disasters from government motors - nothing works together - colors don't coordinate - textures are horrible - the exterior has a mishmash of dents, creases, and concepts.
great  combination for the road warriors that want good comfortable reliable  transportation with some power.
notalwaysbeengood - 04/04/12 09:06 am better looking than the last car by  a country mile, but i find the side sculpting too busy, and the same with the  interior.
nick099 - today 06:49 am the car's underpinnings are  lackluster to say the least.
impalastreetracer17 - 04/03/12 11:46
mustang fanboys probably don't like it bc it resembles the camaro.
i changed my mind about this car.
i doubt a super sport model will offered either.
wow, i hate to say that i'm surprised, but i am!
sleeper91tsi - 04/04/12 01:24
cause you may as well say the same about the  accord too if youre gonna say that.
and we have just been told that  front end was for the trucks....
pm too much car for a 4 cylinder.
that being said, the styling of  this car is just beautiful.
pm accord camry maxima a6 m35 etc in a blender.
i just am disappointed in the rear again.
danv8 - 04/04/12 02:56 pm
in fact malibu's shouldn't have only 4 cylinders only either.
niether car looks bad but this just  seems more masculine and american looking.
am not a bad looking car inside and out, but mostly targeted at the rentals, and the ford taurus and avalons of the world.
i am impressed with the look of this car.
however, i would think the price will undercut the azera.
beard - 04/04/12  06:50 am not bad.
just select a category and a car from the right.

mh_5 - 04/04/12 03:12 pm finally an impala with some substance!
i think it's pretty nice.
davejensen77 - 04/04/12 08:19 pm
impala's shouldn't have 4 cylinders,  it  just is too small for a car that size.
i haven't heard of that being a widespread issue, but i would hope for  better materials and build quality.
this thing is all its own your brain is  lying to you side by side pictures of what youre saying it looks like and youll  feel stupid capitals - 04/04/12 01:46 pm overall a nice car  inside/outside, but the four cylinders, i don't know maybe the turbo with 270hp  will be okay in this car.
the steering wheel in that car was gorgeous (imo).
for it to truly be a rebirth of an icon it would have to be rwd, then it would be a truly amazing car, this however is a very good car for the price and the segment, it looks great but at the end of the day its all show and no go, where as the original impala did both amazingly.
beard - 04/04/12 06:50 am not bad.
since an ss would need the (developing) 3.6l twin-turbo, and  awd to handle the power.
in this day and age of fuel economy regulation, we are likely to never see a rwd car for the masses (save for the charger/300).
glad they kept a  v6 option for a while longer.
there's only two things i don't like about it-
@autobug: the current car is a fleet king because its old and outdated and affordable.
renoboy74 - 03/29/12 04:18
people think  this looks like an azera?
but that is a sharp looking car.
chevys new rwd sedan coming to replace the impala in nascar!!
once i got to "the car will be offered exclusively in front-wheel  drive..." wake me up from this nightmare when gm decides to make  it rwd.
i do however wonder what the advantage of eassist is when the normal  4-banger will produce more hp and similar fuel economy numbers in the real  world.
i like a lot of what i see, but that rear quarter just doesn't work !!
this isn't mindless impala bashing - it is an honest  assessment of a product that just doesn't work as it is offered.
g35cltypes - 04/04/12 01:35
wow, fantastic design along with the great  reliability and handling of chevrolet makes one great car!
the only thing i don't like is the steering wheel, which has always been a problem for gm.
lasvegascolonel - 04/04/12 12:35 pm having  lived through the great impalas that were large cars, v8s, stylish, coupes, and  breathtaking in many ways, i wouldn't normally praise these kid hauler impalas  (sedans), but this is nicely styled and i would consider this over a more bland  camry or accord.
it just doesn't work - some colors make this thing look  profoundly cheap.
is this car is designed by a designer who works for kia/ hyundai and who is impressed by audi a7 rear end?
himoses - 04/04/12 06:02 pm people think this looks like an azera?
and those four cylinder engines sound pathetic for a car of this size.
niether car looks bad but this just seems more masculine and american looking.
major props to the design team both in and out.
start by receiving a no-hassle quote for auto financing.
but this looks way more manly than a 300, avalon, taurus, or maxima ryandarr1979 - 04/04/12 03:58
lay off the sauce name one car in this segment that has a more masculine front end.
throttleblip - 04/04/12 11:28 am car looks great but the ugly steering wheel looks just like the terrible unit found in the current gen mercedes s-class.
a little more "oomph" (30+hp and lots of torque) from the  electric motor would be nice though in such a large car.
with engineering choices not made by the bean-counters of old...but the  political officers of the new regime.
too bad it's "exclusively fwd."
the steering  wheel is horrendous and the toupee on top of the guage cluster is rediculous.
malibu uses the 2.4l only  because the 2.5l was not yet ready, but next year all malibus will use the  2.5l, so why not the impala in 2013?
the steering wheel is horrendous and the toupee on top of the guage cluster is rediculous.
a friend of mine actually has a  gorgeous 65 impala.
nemesis4 - 04/04/12 03:57 pm
i  really wanted to like the impala, mainly because of the late 80's, early 90's  ones (exc. 91-93)
audi, bmw, benz all higher class cars so they don't really  compare...

i at least had hope...a front  wheel drive impala only conveys to the suspense-held public what everyone  feared; that absolutely nothing has changed.
it doesn't worry the chrysler twins (300 and charger) one bit.
seems like to me that gm is trying to protect the sales of the more expensive models based on this platform - the buick lacrosse and cadillac xts.
looks like it should be  rwd.
elgatofuego - 04/04/12 12:39 pm dang, it looks fantastic.
c6vette - 04/04/12 06:02

i see a really ugly honda not a chevy... mixed news with this one, needs an ss model and all wheel drive to battle the ford sho.
vertigo5110 - today 08:10 am
looks so much better than the previous model.
pm it looks like it should be rwd.
my mom has a 2008 saturn vue xr awd (with one of the first iterations of gm's now ubiquitous 3.6 v6 making around 270 hp).
i really like it with the blue color.
oh what a brave new world. bowery01 - yesterday 07:21 pm what is up with the curly q over the back wheel?
those complaining about rwd, wakeup and read!!
upgrayedd - yesterday 12:37
hate to see a  nice design get watered down like that.
nothing like a huge, undulating gap in body panels to scream quality.
04:44 am if 12.9 seconds through a quarter mile (the best time to date for my corvette 327 powered impala) doesn't qualify as fast, i'd hate to see what does.
the only thing i don't like is that steering wheel.
this thing will be just like the ecoboost exploder.
jackal119 - 04/04/12 05:13

ambient lighting is available.
what's with the freaky-deaky hood?
i think it is the best looking front wheel drive sedan under 40.
psycowboy -  04/04/12 03:21
to be honest, full sized sedans should not have such weak  power-trains to began with in 2012.
the new acadia has a steering wheel  from 1990, as does the traverse, escalade etc.
that said, i think for what  this car is intended to be, it executes it quite well.
it would be huge for gm to offer this in awd.
one of the things that made impala a legend was it's strong engine,  and if this car will only provide moderate performance it will also be  considered a dud in the future (like the current generation impala).
nick099 - today 06:49 am the car's underpinnings are lackluster to say the least.
feel as though its  lost its sporty/athletic look in favor of a more premium look.
autobug2 - 04/04/12 06:42
pm think it has been improved and agree some of the design is busy.
a friend of mine actually has a gorgeous 65 impala.
kinda like the design.
gm could have done a better job on the dash pad, it appears to be an  afterthought.
i really cannot believe it look this good.
pm why must chevy take design cues from other chevy models in their lineup and incorporate them in a "redesigned" model?
those are probably the  closest, though they're rwd.
it almost seems to me that chevrolet might be creating a two-tier lineup.
major props to the  design team both in and out.
at least this impala would easily fit in the garage unlike the old ones.
i sure hope that picture is wrong that’s a pretty sad impala.
still starts at $59,825, rx 350 f sport arrives in july
leaps and bounds better than the tired model its replacing though.
the  curves and bulging fenders are a long way from the old slab-sided design  language.
am since when did gm figure out that it's okay to make an  attractive impala?
i was looking at it while i was sitting in traffic.
alex daoriginal - 04/04/12 11:02 am i wouldn't  call it an icon but it's definitely one nice car  i hope this trend  continues.
wrong nothing like  it, the passat even more wrong a cc at best closest resembles this.
i like chevy's, but i don't like this car.
taurus, 300, charger, azera, avalon?
it's always been cross shopped with midsizers like the malibu, fusion, camry, etc... maybe this new model will finally let it step up to other competitors in it's intended class 92vectra1.6i - 04/04/12
i sure  hope that picture is wrong that’s a pretty sad impala.

pm this is the best fwd impala yet, and as far as being reliable, efficient transportation, is the best impala ever.
pm great looking car from the  outside.
i've owned two impalas previously (a 2003 ls, and a 2008 lt), and they were both great cars!!!!
click to view gallery safety was another focus on with the new impala.
one of the things that made impala a legend was it's strong engine, and if this car will only provide moderate performance it will also be considered a dud in the future (like the current generation impala).
i've owned two  impalas previously (a 2003 ls, and a 2008 lt), and they were both great  cars!!!!
i don't  love it, but it looks decent.
nonetheless, they'll sell a ton of these to police departments, rental car  companies, and gm fans.
maybe one of there new small blocks there working on, or a turbo/supercharged v-6.
ejd1984 - 04/04/12 08:14 am it looks great!
am ...and the inevitable return to badge engineering.
i just dont think that moter will have the power to pull this car around, they might want to add a blower to that motor to make it relevent.
but ya back to the  front end comparisons side by side this with a camaro and youll see a  resemblance logan814 - 04/04/12 08:16
i thought the 2.5l replaces it in a few months.
so we now have a chevy cc, i understand the v6 and the semi-hyrbrid, but wtf is with that normal 2.5?
am i like the camaro-esque front.
and the interior if this is def a step up over the azera which basically has the interior of the elantra.
dacronic1 - 04/04/12 10:34 pm y didnt this go rear wheel drive?
but ya back to the front end comparisons side by side this with a camaro and youll see a resemblance logan814 - 04/04/12
everything will hinge on materials and build quality.
the interior looks  great and the front end is ok but the rear door just looks awful.
@autobug: the current car is a fleet king  because its old and outdated and affordable.
am a decent efforts that reminds me of a cross between a camaro and charger that got dialed back a bit.
the regular 2.4l is being  phased out.

chevrolet needs to offer a turbo 4 cylinder with  about 240 horsepower and more importantly, at least 250 lb-ft. with a goal of  35 mpg highway.
and the interior if this is def a  step up over the azera which basically has the interior of the elantra.
i'm 34 and i wouldn't mind driving one.
the efforts by manufacturers to compensate for the  idiotic cafe regulations by the obozo administration have been tried  before....with disastrous results.
i  wasn't expecting anything this nice.
as someone  else stated these new grills for the impala and traverse seem to be for their  upper class models however if you look at least on the impala it has two bars  in the grill symbolizing the single bar found on chevys.
i think anybody  still hoping/praying for rwd on this car is kidding themselves.
not even in the same solar system as this car.
i will  echo everybody else's sentiments concerning the steering wheel.

am certainly some vw passat in that front end design.
great lines, great details, great wheels.
i believe styling is  behind 2013 malibu just like taurus is behind 2013 fusion.
their space, value and style is what people like- most folks could care less about rwd.
looks good,  but there's no flare like the impala has.
for sure, it's nothing like the real impalas that were large, held six adults, v8s, coupes, and stylish from years ago, but for a family that needs 4 doors to cart people around, it should do ok.
the current impala is built okay, but its interior on one of my relative's 2009 is already falling apart.
when i glanced at the picture on the main page i instantly thought it was a new passat.
seriously looking into replacing  her malibu with an impala instead of the new malibu.
it could have been a good competitor for the 300/charger.
nope, can't think of another non-gm car in this class that looks  this good.
i don't love it, but it looks decent.
on top of that, none of the three cars have the exact same powertrains choices.
the  rear door just looks terrible.

look at  compeitors like the taurus and the passat.
the only models that had any kind of acceleration were the ss models and even then they weren't really speed demons.
my mom  has a 2008 saturn vue xr awd (with one of the first iterations of gm's now  ubiquitous 3.6 v6 making around 270 hp).
that said, i think for what this car is intended to be, it executes it quite well.
the ls, lt, and ltz trims carry over to the 2014 impala, which will be built at gm’s detroit-hamtramck and oshawa, ontario (canada), plants.
am hope there is an impala supersport in the works to square off against the taurus sho, bring back the 5.3 ss version with awd
even more comforting than the design is the fact that the malibu and impala finally do not overlap.
but seriously, who  cross shops impala's with anything in it's class?
i like the azera's design better.
notalwaysbeengood - 04/04/12 09:06 am better looking than the last car by a country mile, but i find the side sculpting too busy, and the same with the interior.
the exterior is attractive, the interior offers more  than any of its competitors, and that is all it will take to attract buyers.
and those four cylinder engines sound  pathetic for a car of this size.
though the 2014 impala remains roughly the same size, its design has been dramatically revised.
unfortunately, we'll see a flood of these on the roads as soon as gm pumps budget & hertz rental fleets full of these.
this car is great and its a huge step forward for the impala and its one step closer to greatness.
this doesnt offer awd and it offers the 2.5l. lacrosse doesnt offer  the 2.5 and offers awd.
unfortunately, we'll see a flood of these on the roads as  soon as gm pumps budget & hertz rental fleets full of these.
either way the impala looks good, the interior in the 9th  generation was horrible, the 8th gen was better.
the steering wheel in that car  was gorgeous (imo).
i can't think of any non-gm car in this class  that looks this good:
the value of the impala has always been very strong!!!!
i can't help but notice how much it looks like the current azera though.. almost like they had the azera on hand when they were designing this car.
the car will be offered exclusively in front-wheel drive, and offer three engines to pair with a standard six-speed automatic transmission.
those numbers are up slightly from the 3.6-liter engine in the current impala, which produces 300 hp and 262 lb-ft.
i hope chevy comes out with an awd version, that would be pretty cool.
and i can only assume they will offer an upcoming twin-turbo v6 when ready, the lesser one i assume would be enough.
start by receiving a no-hassle quote for auto insurance.
and then i'll get interested see all 88 comments videos 2013 buick enclave driving footage video the 2013 buick enclave is  taken for a spin in... 2014 chevrolet impala unveiling video
let's hope it stays out of all models.
lord knows i love an ls-x over just about anything.
am i can't wait for the 2014 chevrolet impala, this should be a fantastic car.
