remuneration and benefits for employees are attractive in both toyota and ford and both companies believe in providing for employees through cash and non cash means.decreased commitment between management and employees, temporary relationships, and less emphasis on employer sponsored career growth have not only fundamentally changed assumptions about careers and workforce but also led to anxieties and uncertainty.whereas ford’s hrm policies still follow the production model, which works towards continuous production, toyota, which took many of its initial ideas from ford has now developed a hr methodology that primarily aims to empower the workforce to be proactive, thoughtful, holistic, multi skilled and focused upon continuous improvement.hrm practices in toyota are geared towards employee empowerment, which takes place through systemic processes for constant increase in knowledge, job skills, familiarity with other work, as well as for fostering enquiry, scepticism, and participation.steady inroads made by trade unions over the years also means that all ford workers are covered by contracts that include not just pay and benefits but also a broad range of shop floor actions.unlike ford and gm, toyota has been on a roll, opening factories and recruiting workers even as its american competitors vie with each other to close factories and terminate thousands of workers.despite recent efforts to renew workforce participation, which resulted in thousands of suggestions, even transparently effective recommendations for improving productivity and cutting costs are difficult to introduce because of complex and time consuming procedures and the need for union acquiescence.selection and recruitment policies at toyota are extremely tough and the success rate of fresh applicants is less than 10%.the hr formula at toyota is simple and clear; hire the right people, pay them well, take good care of them, and develop them to work in sync with toyota’s needs.even though toyota follows the widespread japanese traditions of uniforms, common parking plots, common canteens and equal treatment of all workers, there is a clear demarcation between managers and workers.trade unions play a far more dominant role in ford than in toyota, especially in its japanese factories.the enormous number of applicants for jobs with toyota makes the selection process, which specifically include team building exercises, more difficult.whilst absorption and utilisation of modern technology and design have always been associated with ford’s way of functioning, the company even today typifies the “production model” of hr, manifested by tough and consistent practice of industrial relations and a clear focus on the continuity of production.expatriates should expect it to be a great learning experience and prepare accordingly.toyota has extensive international operations, which makes it necessary for its management to adapt to a range of cultural, economic, and political situations.
