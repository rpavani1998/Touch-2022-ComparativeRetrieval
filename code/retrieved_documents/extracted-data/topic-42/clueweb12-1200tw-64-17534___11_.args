passengers are equally as safe in either crossover, thanks to a new center airbag, a rearview backup camera, and standard curtain airbags.they both offer three rows of seats for seven or eight passengers with a long list of optional niceties such as leather seating surfaces, heated and ventilated front seats, a rear dvd entertainment system, and an infotainment system that integrates smartphones.its undeniably more masculine looking and has a nicer interior as well as additional features.power is sent to the front or all wheels via a revised six-speed automatic.the traverse is bigger, gets better mpg and is more powerful than the rest, not to mention it comes with a better warranty.both get the same 3.6-liter, direct-injection v-6 engine rated at 288 hp and 270 lb-ft of torque (or 281 hp, 266 lb-ft with single exhaust on the chevy).the chevy traverse is also a bit heavier, based on gm’s spec sheets, with a curb weight of 4713 and 4956 pounds (front- and all-wheel-drive models, respectively), compared to the acadia’s 4646 and 4840 pounds.pricing for the updated models hasn’t been released, but the current acadia should cost a few grand more than the traverse, depending on trim and drivetrain.the epa rates the acadia passenger volume at 154 cubic feet, which is four more than the traverse.theacadia’s optional denali package ups the tough look with 20-inch rims, fender flares, and lower body cladding.they are both utterly outclassed… the acadia for sure, it looks like it burns the blood of virgins and expels cigar smoke from the exhaust.although that’s just a facade since this is a smaller “crossover” type vehicle it still looks great, and manly.the acadia is officially rated to tow up to 5000 pounds, but the traverse can handle 200 more pounds, gm specs show.the acadia looks like a cheap refresh to me, it lost the sophistication that made me call it the poor man’s american range rover (in a good way) and it just looks too much like the terrain and the gmc xb/cube concept they had out.not an attractive one… i really like the look of the new traverse, either way they are better than their, ford, dodge and toyota counterparts.
