if you read the manual it says that for the first 2000 miles your mileage will be lower than the epa estimates and then will slowly rise and the level off (it has something to do with the conditioning of the battery).
now i get around 44 in the city and 38 on the highway.

do some research, there are many people with not as high mpg on the fusion.
what a 'silly' thing to nit pick about.
the 43 mpg they achieved was on a carefully scripted route by ford, and not more than some 60 miles in the car.
frankly, i'm sick of you guys comparing everything to a ferrari.
i called praveen cherian, ford's hybrid program leader to find out "so, kim, what mileage did you get...?
two numbers -- 41 and 36 -- which the government has certified as the midsizeford's official city and highway ratings.
ford backward is drivers, return
i have had major problems with the toyotas i've owned: mushy cornering, broken a/c's, windows that quit working (major irritation), fabric that falls out and hangs, sun visors that won't stay where you put them, water pumps that quit working for no reason, battery connections that corrode continuously and have to be replaced, the list goes on.

it seems that hybrid buyers have now established a set of experiential expectations for what a "good hybrid" is.
ford is crap, plain and simple and i am sorry many biased americans fail to see it.
am i can tell you as an owner of the 2009 camry hybrid that toyota give customers that expect reliability and a reasonable ride exactly what we want.
darn, there goes getting added to ford's christmas card list yet again.
and simply put, the fusion delivers those subjective goods better than any hybrid on the market.
toyota's tax credit expired last year.
your mileage will definitely vary 2010 ford fusion buyer's guide msrp:
except that it leaves a yawning, 5-mpg disparity betwixt it and the government's combined average of 38.5.
http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/used-cars/reliability/best-worst-in-car-reliability-1005/most-least-reliable-new-cars/0704_most-least-reliable-new-cars.htm and even jd power places toyota above ford in quality and dependability.
and as for my pick, i'd still go with the fusion-- according to consumer reports, it is very reliable, and it is impressively efficient.
i made one long highway trip, 250 miles each way.
the only thing i do different is i start from standing stops a bit more slowly than before, based on the feedback from the green leaves.
i have driven my fusion hybrid now for 3000+ with no mileage reset and it is still averaging 42.7...better than advertised.
nice try though, but i find the fusion design to be a bit gooey looking.
all-in-all, i am very happy with my purchase.
ford is a solid ride.
i would buy an american based car if their quality ever improves to the same level as the toyota brand.
am i have 26,345 on my 2010 ffh and i can not understand how hard people must try to get some of these low mileage numbers.
you must one of the many biased americans who cannot see the truth.
trouble is, our early observations have thefusion's overall number floating around 33.5 mpg.
although the epa has come a long way in rehabilitating its reputation as a creditable source of mileage numbers, that newfound respectability could be suffering a hiccup with the all-new,2010 ford fusion hybrid.
pm i will take fusion.

fords are not solid, and according to consumer reports, they are not as highly ranked as the competition from toyota, honda, nissan, vw, subarau, and even mazda which they partly own.
mxmastro - 10/29/09 12:56 pm
most of car magazines i have read so far have always said the fusion is way more fuel-efficient in real world mileage.
another foreing vs domestic comparison.
i looked that the fusion, and drove it, but i was not impressed with the car at all.
if you read past the headline hype of autoblog's review, they freely admit that most real world driving would be in the 35-37 mpg range.
in the end, toyota would have my money.
and it's quite popular.
i keep up with traffic and don't annoyingly hypermile...and i'm averaging 42.7!
" with the similar size, power and mpg numbers during your comparison test, i too am perplexed by the epa estimate of 41/36 for the fusion hybrid especially considering it has a smaller electric motor and greater weight.
good luck to anyone that buys the fusion, you will certainly need it when it breaks down on you.
so why don’t you pick up a book and learn to read.
whens the last time youve seen an old toyota on the road?
the camry hybrid was a good vehicle for it's day, but it's vanilla in 2009 and as of this moment now the fusion is at least this year the honest winner.
it is by far a superior vehicle, and best of all it is made by an american company.
you supported the junk they build.
kept almost every one of them well over 200k and bought another one.
ford should stay alive so they can continue to make good looking cars.
as mr. cherian points  out, the primary benefit of a hybrid is its recapture of kinetic energy  otherwise lost to braking.
the fusion is definatly way better.
but it's not so loud as to be annoying.
the most interesting part was the mileage differences between mt and epa.
please folks, tell me how you think the fusion is a better performer?
the 33.5 mpg you logged during your fusion hybrid test should also "be regarded as the lead-foot basement of the scale" but it seems very unlikely the fusion hybrid will achieve the epa numbers (38.5) in real-driving.
so what's up with the fusion?
carnyc - 01/09/09 11:21 am oh boy here we go again!
i am here to either throw fuel on this fire or help put it out.

" "umm, about 33 and a half."
syj - 01/13/09 10:27 am fusion looks better and has better handling and full tax credit.
sport driving enthusiasts these cars' target market is not!!
short story fusion wipes the floor with camry.
operate as an ev up to as high a speed as possible in the city and have its engine's relighting be unnoticeable.
other drivers, carefully following the ecoguide displays, were able to record city averages of more of 43 mpg on a similar route""" bbkk - 01/09/09 12:40 pm
however, i must admit, based on looks; focus is better, way better.
the editors like the fusion better.
coffeejolts - 01/19/09 01:37 am seems like everyone + dog except mt is getting the claimed mpg from the fusion.
this car is definitely a winner, even if the sticker price is slightly higher than the toyota's the tax credit should bring it close or even lower than the toyota.
the guy that said ford is crap obviously hasn't driven one outside of a rental fleet.
lets not forget the current camry hybrid is based on 4 year old technology and toyota will be bringing out a new prius for 2010, which will undoubtedly find its way into the next camry as well.
oh, that's right; the blindfold known as bias is doing its job, and that's what chrysler and gm are counting on: bias.
i called praveen cherian, ford's hybrid  program leader to find out "so, kim, what mileage did you get...?
so it is actually cheaper then the official granny mobile, much better looking, and you would be supporting american jobs if you bought it, camry hybrid is built in japan, not the us of a btw.
am i take major exception to the mileage test.

the volume  level of its ev-audio experience has just enough whine to provide that vital  soundtrack of efficiency.
i have owned fords for years and have had no major problem.
i think both these cars are winners, i like how long they went with it (i think it was because they were trying to make a case for the fusion)
proverbs - 01/09/09 11:53 am cut to the chase: in the comparison of mileage and performance, the camry won.
: but first, we'll cut to the chase and right up front anoint the fusion as our overall pick of the two.
i sensed a vibe of  disappointment and decided to change the subject.
although the epa has come a long way in rehabilitating its reputation as a  creditable source of mileage numbers, that newfound respectability could be  suffering a hiccup with the all-new,2010 ford fusion hybrid.
good job ford, but toyota continues to impress...
looks much better though.
if it performs as well as you've shown, it is only stepping up to the competition and will be trailing again with a camry redesign.
compared with thecamry hybrid, its willingness to remain in ev mode is delightful (up to 47 mph while tickling the accelerator -- see our graphic of measurements gleaned from obd2 port to prove it).
what's the buzz about?
you should evaluate them like the buyers shopping them would.
it looks better and it provides the same all around performance than the camry.
and if you read consumer reports, which i don't believe you ever have, they have said countless times, that ford has shown the most improvement out of all the american companies and their quality is just as good as toyrota and honda.
of the least reliable, 29 belonged to america and 2 belonged to japanese.
no doctor phil, in the c@d comparo between the camry, fusion, etc.
i have owned 4 fords in the past, all of them were terrible vehicles that on many occassions left me stranded.
on-board generation of electricity for filling in the engine's torque holes and whatnot, offers a smaller bang for the technological buck (the electricity's chemical storage and recovery involve not-inconsiderable losses).
trouble is, our early  observations have thefusion's overall number floating around 33.5 mpg.
i also remember mt editors saying this!!
so before you start with your "driver returned on foot" crap get the facts pal!
acceleration to mph 0-30 3.0 2.8 sec 0-40 4.5 4.2 0-50 6.3 5.7 0-60 8.4 7.7 0-70 10.7 10 0-80 13.6 12.9 0-90 17.1 16.3 passing, 45-65 mph 4.1 3.9 digifreak22225 - 01/10/09 03:44 am motortrend drivers tend to have a lead foot...
most likely because it's cheaper, faster, more fuel efficient in real life
autoblog recorded 43 mpg!!
with toyota, you will not need it.
you should take off moderate to the speed limit and then go into electric this will charge your battery and give longer all electric driving and with good charge 47 mph is easy for a short distance.
on-board generation of  electricity for filling in the engine's torque holes and whatnot, offers a  smaller bang for the technological buck (the electricity's chemical storage and  recovery involve not-inconsiderable losses).
shut its engine down very quickly when it decelerates.
hmmm...suspicious at best).
additionally you can drive this car very aggressively and and average 37-38 with a mix of city and highway.
this is my third camry
i might be a little interested.

that being said, great job ford!
the mileage on the outbound segment was 54 mpg, and on the way back was 55 mpg.

"so what kind of driving was that?"

"""during the launch drive, i attempted to game the results by gunning away from stoplights and generally doing everything i could to burn up gas and electricity.

it seems that hybrid buyers have now established a set of  experiential expectations for what a "good hybrid" is.
funny a list from consumer reports shows the most and least reliable cars/trucks.
highspeed themxnblood - 01/09/09 12:42 pm this is so weird!
although the taillights on the fusion look similar to the ones on the subaru legacys, which is somewhat disappointing.
something isn't right here!
my camry in the dc area gets 41 mpg on a trip going 70 mph and it gets 36.5 mpg going to work and back.
although if i were to get a hybrid, i would pass by both the fusion and the camry and head straight toward the new insight and save my cash.
cleeto78 - 01/10/09 01:51 am first of all, when has motor trend ever gotten anything close to the epa mileage for the cars they test?!
jefemacheteafilado - 01/09/09 01:47 pm
according to the numbers above and again printed here, the camry is overall better.
of course its gonna win!!
i go 35-40 in all electric for miles with no problem driving like this.
praveen calmly followed up.
and the trunk space is also noticeably less impacted by its battery pack.
don’t ever put found on road dead vehicles on the same level as any japanese competitor.
you and your *** car lovin buddies are the main reason the american auto industry is in the shape it is in.
for the first 1-2k i was averaging around 34mpg on the highway and around 39mpg in the city.

toyota and ford will be playing leap frog with their new hybrid innovations for the next couple of years now, just watch gt500sprsnke - 01/09/09 03:33 pm camry's crap.
am i ordered a ford fusion 2010 hybrid in february, and picked it up in march.
the fusion hybrid drives great!
notably, the pressure to meet these hybrid expectations is now so high that manufacturers will knowingly trade a little efficiency to deliver those experiential goods.
my current running mileage with last reset around 3,000 miles ago is 41.8.
i get anything from 30's to 70's in town driving depending on the charge of the battery and what accessories are running.
yet still i managed a fine 33.8-mpg average.
i have owned both makes of car.
trdsmokedu - 02/09/09 05:19 pm fordtrucks, you and your redneck friends are the reason the american auto industry is the way it is.
while  our early experience suggests the real-world mileages of the fusion and  gold-standardcamry are closer than ford might like, that doesn't mean the  fusion still isn't the better hybrid (and potentially capable of super mileage).
motortrend_online - 01/09/09 02:31 pm couple of things to point out here: car and driver's test average over 300 miles with the fusion hybrid =
i have never had a problem with a ford...ever...in 30 years of driving them.
my all time average is 40.8 this has not been reset for probably 15,000 miles.

in the car and driver comparo, the ford fusion actually beat out the camry in fuel economy!
the mileage may be about equal
like someone quoted before that autoblog recorded 43 mpg in city driving!
i sensed a vibe of disappointment and decided to change the subject.
i'm not sure why the reviewer got such low mileage ...
do not assume you know what i have driven; you know what assuming makes of you?
trdtundra - 01/19/09 06:15 pm coffee, i have driven and owned many fords, and i stand-by my opinion, they are crap.
if i hyper mile i can achieve 50's to 60's in town on tank after tank.
yep, the camry may be plain, but according to consumer reports, the overall reliability and depreciation is much better than a crappy ford.
ultrafastped - 08/02/09 09:52
this is in michigan, so the expressways are pretty flat, but i live in ann arbor, so the local driving has a lot of rolling hills.
i really don't think they had to be becayse the fusion does hold its own against the camry and did beat the camry in some areas.
start by receiving a no-hassle quote for auto financing.
seriously, if it wasn't for the bias, ford would have improved its quality decades ago because they would have been hurting so bad!
next, you guys make a terrible assumption that people won't change their driving behavior when behind the wheel of these things.
solosoldier - 01/16/09 03:49 am i'm with the camry because in 2 years, it will be redesigned while the fusion will still be on this platform.
-rwc- - 01/09/09 10:48 pm
in my opionion though the camry is still the better pick here.
this way you can get your facts straight because mine are.
and simply put, the fusion delivers those subjective goods better than any  hybrid on the market.
i don't care about acceleration-
(in all of their epa tests of all cars) that said, the fusion achieved 45 mpg on the other front page story today, versus the altima hybrid, in cold weather too!

chaise1984 - 01/09/09 01:36 pm i find it funny that the camry pretty won won outright on everything, but still wanted to make the fusion win.
however, the gas mileage difference is perceptible...in fact it's significant.
with that said i still think both cars are winner, and the import fans and dom fans should just chill, we all know you will only buy for you home team.
drfill - 01/09/09 06:09
btw, i'm not interested on this one.
why else do they include roadside assistance?
its got better performance, better new technology, and better gas efficiency.
panhandlewilly - 12/04/09 06:58
of course, that's not to say that the fusion hybrid isn't a great piece of work by ford overall, by all accounts it is.
hey, that's an excellent result in our book.
i have lots of green leaves ...
start by receiving a no-hassle quote for auto insurance.
as mr. cherian points out, the primary benefit of a hybrid is its recapture of kinetic energy otherwise lost to braking.
it should start up exclusively in ev mode.
even if the fusion supposedly won it will probably be short-lived.
this was one piece that was too long, drawn out and a bit boring.
two numbers -- 41 and 36 -- which the government has certified as the  midsizeford's official city and highway ratings.
turbogsx04 - 01/09/09 11:29 am the ford of course frank markus - 01/09/09 11:25 am this is more of a comparison each car's tech and mileage, but there is a winner, on page 2
compared with thecamry hybrid, its willingness to remain  in ev mode is delightful (up to 47 mph while tickling the accelerator -- see  our graphic of measurements gleaned from obd2 port to prove it).
while our early experience suggests the real-world mileages of the fusion and gold-standardcamry are closer than ford might like, that doesn't mean the fusion still isn't the better hybrid (and potentially capable of super mileage).
it seemed like the same typical ford of the past which in a short time will fall apart and cost way more to maintain.
something that people like you don't do on a regular basis, and when something breaks it is automatically ford's fault or gm's fault that they didn't engineer a vehicle that you can just drive without even changing the oil.
keep drinking that coffee, it has obviously gotten to your brain.
i've had many fords, and all have been good, solid vehicles.
toyotanation - 01/09/09 03:15
cleeto78 - 01/10/09 01:54 am one more thing, "the most glaring difference is probably the fusion's hollow door handle thunk when it's released - what a silly thing to allow into production."
if the fusion performs like the epa says and possibly even better by the drivers at fueleconomy.gov, it will have set a new bar for mid-size hybrids.
they're imperceptible in the cockpit.
since my car was made in kentucky, i feel that i gave americans the work to build my car.
perhaps he is a lead foot?
the fusion was middle-ground in acceleration, had the best mpg, and it qualifies for a tax credit(the fusion)
in all honesty, i would still buy the camry hybrid.
so the camry was faster, more efficient, and cheaper, plus no 1st year teething issues, plus higher resale.
recording more than 40 mpg on the fusion's trip computer is not hard if you work at it, see frank markus' blog for more on that: http://blogs.motortrend.com/6412966/green/cold-weather-hybrid-mpg-test-ford-fusion-hybrid-vs-nissan-altima-hybrid/index.html kim reynolds spent 500 miles in the car, and drove it in a number of different real world scenarios.
this ain't 'testing'...it's the real world.
what's the buzz  about?
pm why wouldn't people be willing to change their driving habits?
if you like the *** cars so much go live in japan.
it replaced a ten year old ford taurus.

the camrys, although from toyota which was started in japan, are providing jobs for americans and tax to the american government.

registered badass - 01/09/09 11:18 am so, uh..who won?
i thought this was a you vs you thing.
providing the final nudge to the scale are the ford's nifty new reconfigurable instrument pod, and more important, the fusion's notably more involving driving experience.
see how much you can save!
except that it leaves a yawning, 5-mpg  disparity betwixt it and the government's combined average of 38.5.

it took ford long enough to catch up with toyota in the hybrid game and hopefully they'll stay up to task.
the only thing i did was maintenance.
i have had the fusion hybrid for about 3 months now and i have put on 7324 miles up until now.
