with 390 hp and 735 lb-ft of torque on tap at very low rpm, the power stroke turbo-diesel simply performs, propelling the big truck without drama or noise.drivers were forced to sacrifice amenities for capability, luxury for ability.f-350 is equipped from the factory with substructures and neatly installed electrical connections to make towing simpler, and with electronic trailer sway control to make it safer.it's even remarkably fuel-efficient for such a big vehicle.the four switches can be easily rigged to divert electrical power to an accessory, in order to make the f-350 almost a mobile generator for some fairly heavy-duty equipment (up to 20 amps), especially when paired with an optional ($75) extra heavy duty alternator.f-350's suspension is massive and beefy, with a mono beam front and live-axle rear on the 4x4 version, but it feels pleasantly sure-footed under most conditions.neither toyota nor nissan offer a diesel option on their full-sized pickup trucks in the us, nor do they approach the heavy duty capabilities of the domestic vehicles.crew cab carries a base price of $49,410 ($64,770 as tested) with a 3-year/36,000 mile basic warranty and a 5-year/60,000 mile powertrain warranty.if you only occasionally need the power and capacity of a big diesel-powered truck, this diesel-powered f-350 is probably overkill -- especially since the engine option is $7,835.f-350 is a real truck, and despite the interior amenities, you're never going to forget it while you're behind the wheel.the owners' manual only hints at the possibilities for upfitting -- but it's nice to have a factory-installed head start on customizing the work solutions for your truck.if you need a big diesel-powered truck for towing and hauling, f-350 is a really good choice.though the epa doesn't require fuel economy ratings for big trucks, i consistently achieved over 12.5 mpg during my week with f-350 -- better than i got the previous week with a gas-powered f-250 in similar driving.set up like my test vehicle with single rear wheels, the f-350 is rated to tow up to 14,000 lbs conventionally, and up to 15,800 towing a fifth wheel.my test vehicle seemed to have every box checked on the option sheet, so i had the benefit of anavigation system with satellite radio ($1,875), which included bluetooth technology.
