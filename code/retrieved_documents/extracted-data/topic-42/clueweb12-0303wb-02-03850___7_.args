like toyota, ford charges more for the hybrid upgrade than the fuel savings are worth.it's a better compact for snow and off-road driving than the subaru, plus it's got a gas-sipping hybrid engine like the prius.car buyers could drive whatever they wanted, as long as they were paying the full cost of their gas, and automakers would respond with creative products....the subaru is more old-fashioned 19th-century uu, in the tradition of channing, emerson, and thoreau: it's a rational, durable, reliable, value-priced purchase that can carry you through all kinds of bad weather and get you out into nature when you need to lie down in green pastures and walk beside still waters.each one becomes a free pass for its manufacturer to sell a few extra gas guzzlers...instead of simply saving gas when you buy a hybrid, you're giving somebody else the right to use it.they're not expensive as cars go, just too much for us in this bad economy.you can buy a similarly-equipped toyota corolla with pretty respectable mileage for alot less than what you have to pay for a prius, but you can't buy a prius with the outback's all-wheel drive at any price.)the prius is more 1970's, introspective, post-woodstock uu: it's so darned righteous and energy-conserving and self-image-affirming that its owners are willing to overlook the fact that it is actually pricedhigher than the present value of all the gas it will save, and you can't fit more than two grocery bags into it without squishing the bread.the ford website even has a calculator to help you figure your annual fuel savings if you buy the hybrid.a substantial gas tax would be the simplest, with other taxes being cut to keep down the overall burden.it is an archived story now so it can't be linked to full-text.if you don't need the hybrid feature, ford is offering $2,000 cash-back incentives on the standard-model escape, and mazda is offering $3,000 on the tribute.too bad the benefits of our new cult car have been so exaggerated.... government policy, amazingly enough, seems almost intended to undercut the benefits of efficient cars.february 16, 2006 01:55 pm | permalink for this comment i vote for prius, even though it doesn't actually make sense from a financial perspective, it is far more friendly to god's earth than the subaru because it is has much cleaner emissions.channing would have noted, that pays for a lot of fill-ups, and with those incentives somebody's going to drive that car off the lot and burn that gas whether it's you or not.
