each company also will determine the calibration and performance dynamics characteristics of their respective light pickups and suvs.
at the same time, we will compete harder than ever in the spirit of “making great cars.”
both companies plan to participate equally in the project to hasten the product to market – the new vehicles will also have state-of-the-art telematics and internet services on board – but don’t expect anything until later “this decade.”
the telematics collaboration relates only to standards and technologies, and each company will continue to separately develop their own in-vehicle products and features.
but that doesn’t mean ford-toyota vehicles will be gracing the highways and byways – all the new tech will be under the hood.
but to accelerate the product to markets and to make them more affordable, the companies teamed up as equal partners on the new hybrid system, which is based on a new hybrid powertrain.
also, as telematics plays an increasingly more important role in the in-car experience, both companies have agreed to collaborate on standards and technologies needed to enable a safer, more secure and more convenient in-car experience for next-generation telematics systems.
but that doesn’t mean ford-toyota vehicles will be gracing the highways and byways – all the new tech will be under the hood.
toyota president akio toyoda added, “toyota is extremely proud to join ford in developing a hybrid system for pickup trucks and suvs.
together, the companies are striving for  all-new architecture to deliver the capability truck and suv customers demand, including greater fuel economy.
at the same time, we will compete harder than ever in the spirit of “making great cars.”
“we expect to create exciting and socially beneficial technologies with ford, and we can do so because our two companies have enough experience to create a synergy effect in hybrid technology and in telematics.
as an engineer, i will be deeply gratified to see us fulfill those aims,” uchiyamada added.
the company’s leaders share the same vision – an accelerated path to the technology that will allow their respective trucks and suvs to be as efficient as possible and that will allow both companies to be the cutting edge of the unfolding telematics revolution for vehicles, without sacrificing their individual brands and progress to date.
last week, the ford motor company and toyota corporation announced a new collaboration to develop an advanced hybrid system for light trucks and suvs.
“we have unique and very good solutions today with sync and myfordtouch.
it also brings both companies closer to the 50 plus mpg average fuel economy standard the obama administration wants all companies to adhere to by 2025.
“ford achieved a breakthrough with the ford fusion hybrid, and we intend to do this again for a new group of truck and suv buyers – customers we know very well,” he added.
not only is this tie-up clearly one aimed at making automobiles ever better, it should also become an important building block for future mobility in the u.s. by building a global, long-term relationship with ford, our desire is to be able to continue to provide people in america automobiles that exceed their expectations.”
while the rear-wheel-drive hybrid system will share significant common technology and components, ford and toyota will individually adapt the system into their own vehicles.
the idea to work together to improve the hybrid technology is a way to leverage their knowledge to improve the trucks faster.
“ford achieved a breakthrough with the ford fusion hybrid, and we intend to do this again for a new group of truck and suv buyers – customers we know very well,” he added.
under the mou agreement, both companies will contribute their best research -- the best of their independently developed hybrid powertrain technology and knowledge -- to a new co-developed hybrid system to be used in rear-wheel-drive light trucks arriving later this decade.
we expect to create exciting technologies that benefit society with ford – and we can do so through the experience the two companies have in hybrid technology,” takeshi uchiyamada, toyota executive vice president, research & development, said: the two companies also agreed to work together on enablers to complement each company’s existing telematics platform standards, helping bring more internet-based services and useful information to consumers globally.
his toyota counterpart agrees wholeheartedly.
