cheap, rwd, noisy, underpowered…reading this and faisal’s review, the tata nano would seem to be a bit of a spiritual successor to the e30 corolla – “it does not offer what one would expect from a modern day vehicle.”
what’s changed is that a modern corolla is about a zillion times more refined, has sufficient go to be actually usable, won’t rust nearly as much, and will probably last 300,000 miles with maintenance.
they smirk and know that is nothing but a cover for the interests who profit in the destruction of the middle class.
let’s face it, the asian brands consider quality to be a matter for the engineering and manufacturing divisions, while the domestics consider it something for the marketing department.
my sister owned a 77 corolla base model 1200cc 4 spd 2dr in grey.
reports at the time mentioned that the mobs screamed louder than jimmy page singing, “a whole lotta love”.
hint – it wasn’t the vega, pinto or gremlin.
no carpet only rubber matting.
tens of billions of taxpayer funds, and all we’ve got to show for it is continued inferior quality (at least by comparison to the japanese), a still-coddled uaw and flaming volts.
of course, it’s all about perspective.
there was nothing that made the contemporary corolla a better value than the pinto; they were both well-made by the standards of the time, both got roughly equal mileage from what i recall, and in the case of the pinto used proven mechanicals that had already been manufactured for years.
one thing: ewww, i do remember all that vacuum hosing for emissions controls in cars of this era.
the japanese were able to use a savvy combination of dumping, low cost-labor, union busting, and the occasional decent car to expand on this trend.
and his  search for the perfect e60 want to save gas?
it was a great car to learn to drive in: manual, no power, and the back seat was too small to have any other kind of fun either (though i did try…)
slick-shifting 5-speed, a little 1.6 hemi (2t-c) that loved to rev, smooth idle, comfortable enough seats in front, teen-aged friends could fit in the back if need be.
excuse me, but by the standards of 1975, this car was a toyota.
the modern sibling would wipe it out.
then you would know that the country has been in a serious recession since the early 1990s.
while i like the basic design of the pinto, i know enough to know that it was nothing remotely as nice as what was coming out of europe or japan.
if you were a ford dealer trying to move pintos in 1975, you  probably woke up screaming with corolla nightmares, every night.
cars were required by washington to have cow catchers on front and back, replacing the bumpers.
if you look footnote 76 on page 1032 of the rutgers law review article, the fire-related death rate for 1973 pintos in operations was well over twice that of other 1973 subcompacts.
chrysler corporation quality was so variable in the 1970s, however, which seemed to get worse as the decade progressed.
it never had warm up issues nor needed to be retuned for altitude.
0-60 times were so slow, major auto publications began using sun dials.
trolls deliberately try to piss people off.
he concluded, however, that the sedans and hatchbacks built from 1971 through 1976 did have an unsafe fuel tank and fuel filler tube design.
“if you were a ford dealer trying to move pintos in 1975, you probably woke up screaming with corolla nightmares, every night.”
if you doubt that, i’d suggest reading back issues of consumer reports.
pintofan: now that the mania of buying disposable foreign junk with no regards to consequences is embedded in the national psyche, it has become a great meme for the economically unaware.
no – it wasn’t the drugs being ingested.
i fully expect to see it around after the apokolips.
who’s jimmy page then?
chrysler quality and reliability had been sliding downhill since about 1970.
i know that firsthand – i owned a 1975 duster 360 for six years.
so there was no built-in “premium”.
while true that the list price was higher, i only paid $3800 for the 75 manta.
and the pinto was not any more dangerous than other contemporary small cars.
cocaine was often abused at that time, but i’m sure that was merely a coincidence.
i must have lived on a different planet.
pintofan: your defense of your ’77 civic is utterly predictable.
tariffs and other informal barriers help special interests (in the auto industry, that would be fat-cat executives, shareholders and unions) while hurting customers.
i just sold my 65 dart wagon.
they were both terrible on that score.

when we discuss 1975, let’s focus on how well we all seemed to have compromised that year, producing some of history’s most forgotten moments.
i remember that the japanese dealers were charging above sticker for their less dsirable cars resulting in very little price difference.
and then there’s the uaw, which adds costs while not adding value (quite the opposite).
she drove it for a few months, neglected to put oil on it, and by the time i got it back it exhaled large amounts of blue smoke.
the transmission hump between the two butt cups prevented a fun evening more effectively than an 82 year old amish chapparone with a bull whip.
no, what the japanese have instituted – or, more accurately, what toyota instituted, and honda more or less copied – was a lean production system that improved product quality and lowered cost, benefiting customers, workers and shareholders.
pintofan: i worked for multi-franchise auto dealerships from 1971-1996, including some years as a service advisor and in parts.
that shows which car was seen as being more desirable, doesn’t it?
pintofan: add to that conveniently unverifiable myths about superlatives such as “quality” and “value” and you have an argument that is guaranteed to be won only by the most dedicated of sophists.
the corollas and datsun b210′s were truckish, underpowered cramped little versions of bigger cars.

i said “a” banner year, not “the” banner year.
it had more power than the corolla, and didn’t rust as badly.
the valiant and dart were both bigger and more expensive than a corolla.
that thing is a cocroach.
some (ford) have responded more effectively than others (gm and chrysler).
the fact that you disagree with him doesn’t make him a troll.
the idea that the uaw is the backbone of the middle class, or that everyone suffers because uaw members have a higher co-payment for their prescriptions drugs, is a myth believed only by the gullible or the hopelessly stupid.
the pinto was more rust resistant than the japanese cars, but when it came to refinement and consistent quality control, the japanese easily won.
while the aforementioned cars suffered the drivability horrors of primitive, power robbing emission controls, the opel was equipped with bosch l jet tronic, multiport fuel injection that met 1975 epa regs without a catalytic converter.
this car’s last owner was serious enough about his or her car to join thetoyota owners and restorers club, but that wasn’t enough to keep the ol’ corolla out of the jaws of the crusher.
they all say the same thing – toyota and honda make the most reliable, trouble-free cars.
sales figures don’t tell the entire story.
i speak from personal experience.
and the 1st gen corolla looked better.
you can not argue that a slant six is not a durable engine.
hope this helped with the discussion.
and in a 1975 pontiac ventura at that.
and it is not the only work that has tackled the pinto controversy.
i have pretty good memories of these cars.
i will grant that pintos were fairly sturdy cars, but when it came to fit and finish, any toyota, datsun, or honda would see them off.
if by “lingering suspicion” you mean “common sense,” then sure.
the pinto felt rough, slow, and crude even next to a corolla, much less a civic.
“ballad of the green berets”?
i grew up mostly with mopar products and one of them was a ’64 dodge station wagon with the 225 slant six, torqueflite auto and it lasted us until 1977 with over 140k miles on it, and that was a rare thing back when it was made, and in the 70′s, most cars could get over 100k miles with no problem, 150k was considered the theoretical limit by the mid to late 70′s, now, 200k+ is common, with the japanese being some of the first to go that much without a major rebuild – that was in the 80′s as we’ve seen many of these japanese cars doing just that, with many beginning as early as the mid to late 70′s where rust isn’t an issue onwards.
oh, and the built in subsidy known as single-payer the rest of the civilized world enjoys.
once ford got the bugs worked out of the first-generation north american escort, and debuted the improved 1985 1/2 model, it was more competitive with the toyota corolla and honda civic than it had been in the mid- and late-1970s with the pinto.
the corolla was a better car than the vega, but that isn’t saying much.
and again, for the record, my 1977 corolla was rusty, underpowered crap.
i drove it for years (one year with studded tires year-round because i was too cheap to buy new summer tires – don’t judge me!).
what i “admitted” was that every country subsidizes the home team in various ways.
i want to know if pintofan and tempofan[?] are brothers….
but in japan, this happens because everyone knows what side their bread is buttered on.
just pull it out when you started it and as the the engine idled it pushed itself back in.
i know these corollas and murilee is right – they’re just not much fun.
as for a 1975 domestic car, i’d wager that a dart or valiant with the slant six would last at least as long as the corolla.
was the corolla really that much better than the pinto, aside from the handling?
at least in the case of ford, the “quality gap” in small cars didn’t really start to appear until the 1980′s, and even then it was thin at best.
it’s strange how the passage of a few decades makes the mid-70s corolla seem like a much better car than it actually was.
or is this just another example of domestic vs. import perception.
most of us have never made uaw wages, and higher new-car prices (the inevitable result of tariffs and informal barriers) do not create wealth, but only transfer a larger percentage of it from car buyers to shareholders and blue- and white-collar employees.
they just ended up getting burned to death.

it sounds like you didn’t have much fun in 1975.

far less entertaining than the contemporary (and fwd) honda civic.
actually toyota only suffered vacuum and emission nightmares after 75 along with the big bumpers.
your devotion to and defense of such a substandard car like the pinto is both touching and sad, as well as being to no avail.

let’s discuss politics, because, well, just because it brings in the blog traffic.
i thought there was something wrong with it, and a family friend had to explain that japanese engines naturally revved high.
thing is, “cramped, underpowered, noisy econobox that lasted maybe 150,000 miles” – that 150k miles was probably almost twice as good as any domestic car at the time, too.
both of my hondas got over 180k miles on them, and they would’ve gone much more than that if neither of them had been rear ended.
of course, it’s all about  perspective.
it was really much better.
still better and more affordable than the domestic or european competition.
people who were of a practical mind and who understood the economic value in buying domestically produced “unfashionable” brands bought pintos and were quite satisfied with their cars.
bubbles under the paint insured rust with a year and massive holes within three.
what the japanese have created is a self-perpetuating mythology that is impossible to combat on logical grounds because it is anchored in nothing.
so, you are saying that you were pretty much stoned in 1975?
just logging in to say that this pintofan guy is such a troll.
i remember the ease of driving it, the direct feel of the shifter and the heavy vibration as my hand was on it, and the time it took to accelerate.
as gm and chrysler, and, to a lesser extent, ford, have proven over the past 40 years.
the base msrp for the 1975 corolla was $50 less than the cheapest pinto
panel gaps consistent, and small.
when adjusted for content and technology, i decided that the manta was actually cheaper even though it was a class above the corolla and one below the bmw that cost a lot more.
and the only “rebellion” driving the sales of toyotas, hondas and datsuns in the 1970s was a rebellion against too many shoddy small cars produced by the domestics.
you wouldn’t have been able to obtain the privilege of toyota badge ownership for anywhere near what a comparable domestic car would have cost you in 1975.

we need a 1st gen celica!
you are correct, the article was published in 1991, not 1981.
ford had far more dealers than toyota in 1975, and there was still a lingering suspicion of foreign cars in many parts of the country.
if you doubt that, read contemporary road tests of both cars.
your real beef is with computers and improved production processes, not cheap foreign labor.
agreed on the sales point.
i’m embarrassing myself, aren’t i?
the pinto was a better car that was vastly more rust-resistant than anything coming out of japan at the time.
i my first car too – hand-me-down from my grandmother who bought it new.
but i wouldn’t say they were ‘vastly more rust-resistant’ than a corolla.
and that is being driven by improved production processes and automation, not outsourcing.
if you got a good pinto, great, but if you didn’t… the scary part is that the vega and gremlin were even worse than the pinto.
once the japanese car-tel had been given free license to pimp their heavily subsidized wares in every city in america by the late 70′s, toyota caught up to ford and gm.

i was debunking that notion with my statement.
which was okay, for its role.
ah, the joys of compromising.
agruing that a pinto was better than a contemporary corolla (let alone a contemporary civic) is a hopeless cause.
my experience mirrors most dart/valiant owners, too.
several family members had post-1985 escorts.

the manta was indeed a nice car, but it wasn’t a pinto competitor – it was up against costlier and sportier cars.
what toyota built its reputation on was novelty, and the self-destructive fascination with foreign cars that characterized much of the early 70′s.
japanese cars weren’t great, but at least they were still in good shape when you paid them off.

you might as well argue that a big mac extra value meal is better than the meal at a five-star restaurant.
pot hurts your reading comprehension.
cars like this offered better reliability, fuel economy, and more value than the likes of pintos, vegas, and chevettes.
when you have driven one, along with the contemporary competition, let me know.
this large number of wagons could skew the final fire-related fatalities figure in the pinto’s favor.
my grandmother had a 1973 dodge dart sedan…it was very reliable and reasonably well-made.
john denver wasn’t even on my radar in 1975 much less commanding my attention.
a corolla was better because cardboard pine tree air freshners didn’t burst into flames when hung from their rear view mirror, as they did in the pintos, especially after they were rear ended by a blown shopping cart in an oil and transmission fluid stained goldblatts parking lot in calumet city, illinois.
pintos were sold to those who bought american no matter what or who didn’t know anything about cars.
the wagon theory was not part of schwartz’ paper and it sounds rather dubious to me overall.
i know this question does not reflect conventional logic, as everyone knows the pinto exploded when you touched it, but . . .
oh wait, it’s already nonstop now, with the american government having done practically none of these things.
very reliable, and so easy to service.
it was my first car” story, but i loved it!
as with an episode of kojak promising that manhattan crime could be beaten, the toyota corolla promised the world that detroit crimes against autodom could be beaten in the year – uh – what was that year again?
the cologne engine was just as efficient and reliable as whatever vacuum-carb nightmares toyota was equipping their cars with in the 70′s.
yes, because it was a better car.
this may have more to do with the chemicals i ingested in the 80s, than any goodness that actually came out of the polyester/van love/disco era.
granted, itwas quite a car for the time, with a combination of price, reliability, and fuel economy that detroit and europe couldn’t touch… but if we take ourselves out of themindset of the malaise era and fast-forward our vehicular expectations maybe ten years, this generation of corolla turns out to be a cramped, underpowered, noisy econobox that lasted maybe 150,000 miles (if you lived in the rust-free southwest).
two, the death rate for fire-related accidents in the pinto was slightly higher than normal for other small cars of that time.

victor’s history has painted a rosy myth of superior japanese quality winning the day, but the truth is much uglier and less politically convenient for the anti-domestic crowd.
his former roommate had a rabbit, and my brother really liked the car.
it was likely a crappy car
there was no doubt as to which was better.
as for novelty, the corolla had been sold in the us since 1969 and began achieving real volume starting in 1970.
you might read up on your recent history of japan.
and it was one hella fun car to drive and i drove it like i stole it a lot.
it’s strange how the passage of a few decades makes the mid-70s
ford and chevrolet were still the default choices of most buyers, particularly among those looking for an economy car.

also, since 1975 was the last year that the german-built opels were imported into the us and sales had collapsed due to the rising dm vs. dollar exchange rate, you probably got a clearance price from your dealer.
you can attempt to rewrite history all that you want, but the simple fact is that the japanese were rapidly improving their products in the 1970s, while the domestics were steadily getting worse.
take me home, country roads, to the year i forgot, 1975.
is he that jamaican singer?
one, the overall death rate from all types of accidents for the pinto was average for contemporary small cars.
and if corollas were so bad, and pintos were so great, why can i buy a 2012 corolla, while i can’t buy a 2012 pinto?
ugliest shade of yellow ever and the only option: an am radio.
what gave american cars of that era such a bad reputation was the hit or miss (and way too many misses) nature of their quality.
then let’s go to music.
corolla seem like a much better car than it actually was.
the manta was in a different class and far more expensive than the other subcompacts you mentioned.
totally correct on the honda civics, i had an ’83 1500dx hatchback civic with the 5spd manual (with working air no less!)
you won’t find self-defeating pseudo-libertarian jargon about “open markets” and “free trade” in that country.
the pinto had two butt cups you plopped into backwards, like you are going to take a dump in a phone booth.
however, the dart and valiant were extremely sturdy and long-lived mechanically with the only real weakness being rust (something the toyota wasn’t immune to either).
and, i hate to break it to you, but japanese quality was superior to domestic quality by the late 1970s.
and true villains at the pump review: 18,000 hp  nissan car carrier nichioh maru (2012 model, jdm spec)
however, the #1 song for the year was “ballad of the green berets”.
sorry, but it’s not “common sense” to buy an inferior product because it happens to be made here.
i believe you are referring to the september 1981 rutgers law review article on the pinto controversy, so some points need to be clarified.
but at least i got to admit that you have no problem with a double standard in terms of “free” markets, as long as america comes out the loser.
i’m pretty sure the pinto beat out the corolla in every year they were sold side by side.
if things were so great before, and they were producing such awesome vehicles, why did they have to change their operations and vehicles so drastically?
and to suggest that only the japanese automakers received subsidies from their home government is naive, at best.
now that the mania of buying disposable foreign junk with no regards to consequences is embedded in the national psyche, it has become a great meme for the economically unaware.
the difference is that ford had to heavily discount the pinto to sell it, while toyota was able to sell the corolla at or near list.
i love the attitude in some blogs (like j******k) that just because some old econobox is rwd, then it must automatically be a joy to drive.
yes it was bit more upscale after all it was sold at buick dealers.
it wasn’t a pinto flambe.
i had the car for seven, rust free and trouble free years.
the fact that the domestics have overhauled their entire operations, from the design studio to the factory floor, to improve their products, confirms this.
better tires won’t help the crude live axle, woolly steering, barely adequate brakes, or limited suspension travel.
the rabbit along with the civic were almost radically different (at least in my part of the midwest), but the vw had the advantage of having a larger dealer network and good name recognition.
it is a fact, supported by independent surveys over the years.
i keep forgetting it…
and the rock banner year was 1979.
yes, that is because those “foreign car apologists” (in the real world, we call them “paying customers who have voted with their hard-earned dollars”) have an understanding of economics that seems to have eluded you.
what’s significant is that this figure specifically excluded the pinto wagons for that year.
you have to be a little careful with false nostalgia.
you don’t see many corollas of this era with automatic transmissions, for obvious reasons.
$3,800 was still over a grand above a base corolla, which had an msrp of a little over $2,700 in 1975.
and when it comes to government subsidies, the u.s. government’s tens of billions of dollars bailout of the uaw (via the bailout of gm and chrysler) — tens of billions of which will never be repaid (see, e.g., gm’s tax loss carryforward), simply dwarfs any alleged subsidy or trade favoritism that the japanese could have concocted.
gerald ford was president.
last month i saw two beautiful, unrestored dodges.
not only that, but the europeans were far above the domestics on fit and finish, safety and driving dynamics (on reliability, well, not so much).
i know the anecdotes . . .
if the advantage a nation incurs by having a single-payer health insurance system is so great, then why build plants here?
granted, itwas quite a car for the time, with a combination of price, reliability, and  fuel economy that detroit and europe couldn’t touch… but if we  take ourselves out of themindset of the malaise era and fast-forward our  vehicular expectations maybe ten years, this generation of corolla turns out to  be a cramped, underpowered, noisy econobox that lasted maybe 150,000 miles (if  you lived in the rust-free southwest).
even though he concludes that there was some unacceptable risk to the pinto in terms of rear impacts with fire, i say that the overall number of these incidents is too tiny to really be statistically significant.
unfortunately, government subsidies, over the long run, won’t outweigh lousy vehicles greenlighted by boneheaded management and produced by a spoiled union.
this corolla is what toyota built its reputation on.
please show me where that is illegal.
murilee had a post awhile back with a civic’s vacuum schematic: frightening!
the wagon was extremely popular and accounted for a very high percentage of pinto sales.
pintofan: before the outsourcing madness of the 70′s and 80′s, you would have been laughed out of the room with your “logic.”
both the corolla and the pinto were mechanically reliable for the time, and the pinto had much better corrosion protection than any japanese car then available.
it just begged to be driven and did quite well on i-5 heading to medford oregon from tacoma washington and back with no problems at all.
if that means that executives can’t take home big bonuses or union members have to start worrying about things like productivity and quality control…well, boo-hoo-hoo.
cars designed before this year looked like kids with 400 pound stainless steel braces on their teeth.
at any rate, they were hardly more fun to drive than a corolla, and the term “chrysler quality control” was an oxymoron even for the valiant and dart in 1975.
that was far down from the ’73 peak of 544,209 units but by then demand for all small cars had pretty much collapsed.
the handling and roadholding are uninspired, the engines get noisy and thrashy when revved, and the whole car gives off a sensation that it doesn’t like to be pushed hard.
before the outsourcing madness of the 70′s and 80′s, you would have been laughed out of the room with your “logic.”
it was even more of a contrast when it came to the driving experience.
toyota corolla print
the car was quite reliable she got over 150k out of it.
sort of like now this was my first car.
the band is idolized now, but in 1975 it was john denver everyone idolized.
the really scary part is that the domestics were on the way down by the mid-1970s, while the japanese were clearly on the way up.
the interior was actually usable and didn’t require that you crawl into a back seat designed by a yoga instructor with a mengele complex.
“have you ever been mellow?”
i’ve driven both japanese and american small cars from the 1970s.
competitive small wagons weren’t nearly as popular, nor did they constitute such a high percentage of their respective model’s total sales.
they got where they are by building superior products.
that, and also the fact that when you take a gallon of milk and compromise it with urine, you don’t get a milkshake.
john denver was so big, a midget version of him appeared as cousin oliver on “the brady bunch”, and when the zepplin crowd wasn’t vomiting on boston, you could hear them copy denver’s catchphrase, “far out!”
pintos were sold to those looking for reliable, basic, no-frills transportation that didn’t see the point in paying a premium for a foreign car of basically equal quality.
sorry, but the corolla was a better car than the pinto.
or maybe they, too, are part of that vast, japanese-car conspiracy.
he was the big bald guy that seemed like the kind of white man anyone could have had a beer with and not be embarrassed if we let out a fart around.
while that year was not exactly landmark, i don’t remember it as being quite so gruesome.
in my neck of the woods, it was the vw rabbit.
if you were around at that time, there was no doubt as to which side had the momentum, and which side was coasting on laurels won long ago.
pintofan, i was there too in the 1970s and the japanese were embarrassing detroit when it came to build quality.
my understanding is that the pinto was quite reliable relative to the standards of the day.
your defense of your ’77 civic is utterly predictable.
the simple fact is that they squandered those advantages with a combination of arrogance and complacency.
the myth of the ford pinto case by gary schwartz was published in 1991, not 1981.
they are both utterly out of thier minds regardless, but as the saying goes, there is an @ss for every seat!
but, it did have soft cloth seats, ha, bet those “stains” are still there in a junk yard somewhere!
from what i see in consumer reports, this is still the case, albeit the gap may have closed somewhat.
he is sandwiched between richard malicious nixon, the guy villified since 1948 by the people who believed they were better than us, and jimmy holier-than-thou carter, the guy timothy leary claimed was the second coming of jesus christ.
so, that mustang ii looked pretty good in 1975 – didn’t it?
at any rate, one has to consider the number of pinto wagons that were on the road, and their safer fuel tank and fuel-filler tube design, when looking at the pinto’s fire-related death rate as a result of rear collisions.
alice cooper, your ride got neutered.
douglas birsch and john h. fielder wrote an excellent book, “the ford pinto case,” which covers many aspects of the controversy, and there have been many others.
the only option was an am/fm radio.
or the bmw 320i, but you had to be a trust-fund baby to afford one of those.
1975 vega, pinto, datsun, toyota were all crap mobiles compared to the under appreciated 1975 opel manta.
almost 1/3 of pintos sold that model year were wagons – hardly an insubstantial percentage.
chrysler quality control could be very slapdash in the 1970s.
it’s become terribly sad that you have become so blind as to the truth about what had/has happened in the automotive industry that you feel compelled to defend to the death the poor pinto despite it’s major faults.
insult it all you want, but i have warm fuzzy memories of the 70s.
but that was only after the japanese government had basically re-focused the entire economy of the country towards beating american industry.
hmmm, seems too harsh to me.
“corollas of this era were cheap-to-run transportation appliances – nothing more.”
it wasn’t a mustang ii.
they have undergone a revolution, and their vehicles reflect japanese attention to detail and quality control, along with european levels of handling and braking.
led zepplin fans destroyed boston because led zepplin wasn’t banned there anymore.
it won hands down in all categories – body, paint, suspension, engine.
a 1973 corolla sr-5, in particular.

if you were a ford dealer trying to move pintos in 1975, you probably woke up screaming with corolla nightmares, every night.
it would be fun to put modern tires on this crude little beast and challenge it’s 800lb heavier modern sibling to some tests.
after pushing large body on frame vehicles that got seven miles per gallon into gas stations in 1974, americans woke up with a mustang ii or an amc pacer in their driveway.
and it’s telling that the escort nameplate lasted almost 20 years in the united states – or twice as long as the pinto nameplate did.
this car’s last owner was serious enough about his  or her car to join thetoyota owners and restorers club, but that wasn’t  enough to keep the ol’ corolla out of the jaws of the crusher.
1975 conspired to be forgotten.
i grew up on large sized domestic sedans and my parents bought a ’76 honda accord, and ended up with 2 more and mom had one more after dad died, and i had 2 used hondas, they all served us well and without issues, other than the timing belt in the ’85 accord breaking, fortunately, not on the upstroke as it was an interference motor so nothing other than a fresh belt/water pump was needed.
ford, for example can build more vehicles with fewer people than it could in the 1990s (or 1970s), and with higher quality, to boot.
it was the olivia newton john of the car shows in 1975.
that’s why the pinto has gone the way of lawn jarts, kent micronite filters, and aluminum condoms.
and best of all, you bought it from a buick dealer and not some thinly reformed, white collar criminal posing as a toyota dealer.
now excuse me, there is a mr. landshark at my door with a flower delivery.
then how are the germans, japanese and south koreans able to built plants in the united states and provide health insurance for employees without any problems?
what has declined is manufacturing employment (by 30 percent over the same period).
there was also plenty of good music around if you were willing to get past top 40 and dig a bit.
toyota corolla by murilee martin on april 18,  2012
that junkyard shot shows a fenderwell-mounted box with a few dozen hoses terminating .
once ensconced in said pinto butt cup, your forward view was of the back of the front seats covered in essence-of-polychloride faux naugahyde straight from a chemical vat in a czech lab where all the male workers had developed breasts from the hormones used to make the pinto interior feel cheaper than a discount aisle at an abandoned kmart – but saved ford fifty cents per yard.
people at the time bought corollas because they were novel, not because they were good cars.
my first car was a used 1977 honda civic, while my father owned a 1973 gremlin, an aunt owned a 1977 pinto and friends owned various vegas.
they “won the day” in the small-car segment by building better vehicles, and all of the attempts to rewrite history by buy-american fanboys and uaw apologists won’t change that fact.
you’re going to have to do better than this if you want to convince people.
i’m sure you’ll say that’s because whatever toyota had to sell was vastly better, but millions of pinto owners didn’t fall for that shell game.
it’s not the responsibility of customers to buy an inferior vehicle in order to ensure that executives receive huge bonuses or uaw members never lose their jobs.
let’s remember that when we hear folks complaining about how no one gets along anymore.
corollas were bought by people who were “bored” with domestic cars and loved the thrill of rebellion they got from being the first one with a japanese car on the block.
the japanese can smirk all they want, but they can only wish that their country’s economy had performed as well as that of the economy of the united states since 1990.
sales of the pinto in ’75 were brisk, with 223,763 units sold.
the 1975 valiant and dart look good today because we now know that what came next was even worse.
most people reject that “logic.”
three, the above figure needs to take into account that the pinto wagon never had a problem with its fuel tank or fuel filler tube.
the gremlin was actually more prone to rear impacts with fire, and the small datsuns had the highest fatality rate of any subcompact car that was not the beetle (which is in its own special category as far as danger was concerned).
you  don’t see many corollas of this era with automatic transmissions, for  obvious reasons.
they weren’t very exciting (none of them had the gt model), but they were reliable and a very good value for the money.
the ‘buy american’ pushback had begun in earnest by 1975, but that’s all that kept the domestics as sales leaders.
if the wagons are included in the most of the calculations (and nothing i’ve read leads me to conclude that they weren’t), but this body style never had a problem with fuel tank or fuel-filler design, then that must be taken into consideration.
but post-college jobs being what they are and no credit history yet, he didn’t qualify for the loan, so he ended up with a used car instead… i love these philosophical discussions.
ok, i’m glad to see i’m not the only one who remembered that, too.
numbers don’t mean all that much except for the bottom line – after all, gm sold 800,000+ chevy citations for 1980.
in order to give the market vehicles that delivered better fuel economy, detroit began shipping all their vehicles with empty engine compartments, which was an improvement compared to the four cylinders suddenly offered in 4000 pound vehicles that year.
both the pinto and the corolla had fairly similar back-seat access.
the pinto was the best domestic small car of the 1970s, but by 1975, that wasn’t enough.
nixon was great, and i’m not kidding, although i don’t involve myself in politics anymore.
my parents and i got lucky as all of our cars were reasonably reliable but the hondas were so much better put together than anything by detroit up until more recent years.
a 74 dart swinger and a feather duster, 76 i think.
the muscle car era was murdered along with lieutenant colonel henry blake, so the gto and the road runner were gaudy stripe options on pathetic compact cars.
plus 1979 sure was not “the” banner year for rock!
i hate to break it to you, but from the “boots on the ground” level of seeing who was naughty and who was nice, throughout that period, on average the japanese brands were head and shoulders above the domestics.
as for fun, the handling of the torsion-bar-equipped mopar a-cars was a cut above other domestic compacts.
denver was america’s biggest solo artist in 1975.
it also ignores that the domestic automakers enjoyed several key advantages in the 1970s, including strong brand identities, a large body of owners and a strong dealer network.
