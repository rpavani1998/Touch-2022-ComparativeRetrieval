the sliding rear window with privacy glass makes it easy for passengers to reach back into the bed (or for a cool breeze to be diverted into the truck,) and the tacoma’s large exterior proportions translate to a commanding view of the road from inside, where the cabin’s user-friendly vibe offers a pleasant contrast to the truck’s outward appearance of utility.power steering boost is high and the cabin feels quiet at speed, and there’s adequate thrust from the v6 to propel this dual cab beast to high velocities rather handily.the v6 puts out 236 horsepower at 5,200 rpm and 266 lb-ft of torque at 4,000 rpm, and is rated at 16 mpg city, 20 mpg highway.but at higher speeds (like i encountered when driving from la to dirtbike-friendly trona pinnacles, just outside death valley), the tacoma proves hushed and comfortable, and the jbl sound system produces full sound that’s a great antidote to the doldrums of long distance driving.if there’s a testimony to its versatility, it’s the fact that this toyota took care of business without breaking a sweat—a fairly impressive feat that makes the tacoma double cab as effective at transporting motorcycles as it is at commuting across town.coil spring double wishbone suspension components are found up front, while a leaf spring setup with outboard-mounted shocks are setup at the rear.over the course of roughly 1,000 miles, our tacoma offered equal doses of utility and comfort.the five-speed transmission shifts smoothly, though the ride isn’t quite as seamless as the gearbox.despite its high altitude cabin, the tacoma feels somewhat car-like—especially considering its chassis uses frame-on-body (as opposed to unibody) construction.the narrowest distance between the wheel wells (41.5 inches) leaves enough room for two dirtbikes to be loaded up side-by-side, and sliding mounting hooks allow tie-downs to be repositioned.and while it’s almost impossible to predict the impact of the current flack over toyota’s quality control issues, we can safely report that our time spent with the double cab tacoma reminded us of what toyota does right with its trucks.the truck’s four-wheel abs brakes utilize discs at the front wheels, and drums at the rear.the interior feels somewhat like a camry on stilts, though a few plasticky bits (like some of the dash surfaces and thecupholder-equipped door panels) keep the tacoma from feeling altogether luxurious.it may feel bulky under most city circumstances, but the tacoma shines on longer excursions with its well-insulated cabin that offers a commanding view of the road.but while sampling honda’s latest motocross offerings, it was the perfect opportunity to also test a pickup truck’s ability to haul them.
