compared to toyota's minivan, the highlander hybrid break-even point approaches the 3-year mark.
we'll stick with the limited grade to stay close on equipment.
why this works this rational case for a hybrid crossover suv only pencils out because the 2011 highlander hybrid has been substantially improved over the last year in certain crucial areas.
10/04/2010 ajt123 should tell the millions of peopl worldwide who buy toyota's that toyota is apparently beneath honda and nissan.
speed is all well and good, but the payoff in the cost equation comes from increased fuel economy.
ok, the 2011 toyota highlander hybrid may not be for you.
as mentioned already, no other 3-row vehicle with a v6 comes close to the overall fuel economy.
the ipod and aux integration works really well.
the highlander hybrid is primarily a front-drive machine; the rear wheels are driven exclusively by another electric motor and there's no driveshaft connected to the transmission.
the new rearmost seat is now split 50/50 down the middle, so four can still ride with one-half of the second and third rows folded for those long items.
sure, the good ones use a lot less fuel than their conventional gasoline counterparts, but they cost more to buy, too.
so thats a no until the coverage dramatically improves or the cost dramatically drops.
only 10.3 cubes are available behind the third row, but that jumps to 26.3 when one half is folded, as can now be done as of this year.
the best cuv out there for under $50k. we've had a pruis for the past six years, so we know what we're missing in terms of the toyota hybrid experience.
as expected, the regenerative braking system emits the same faint keening produced by every other toyota hybrid.

yes, we know; the sheet metal is essentially unchanged — this is a midcycle refresh, not an all-new generation.

they did hit the front end of the hybrid with the ugly stick, but the rest of the van and interior look fine.
the manufacturer provided edmunds this vehicle for the purposes of evaluation.
bottom line:the highlander hybrid may just be the perfect choice for families that want a hybrid powertrain and three rows of seating but don't need or want a minivan.
why this works this rational case for a hybrid crossover suv only pencils out because the 2011 highlander hybrid has been substantially improved over the last year in certain crucial areas.
crossover cross-shoppers say you're shopping along the border between minivans and crossover suvs.
if you're prepared to spend minivan money anyway, the 2011 toyota highlander hybrid starts to make a kind of sense.
it makakio says: 04:22 pm, 09/29/2010 haven't done the hybrid, but just took a trip in a new '10 limited awd model up the ca coast.
it comes standard with a third-row seat.
conventional wisdom would pit this against its v6 gasoline equivalent, the 2011 highlander limited 4wd, which costs some $6,600 less.
the interior is flexible and comfortable, it finally has a useful third row and interior controls don't get any more logical or easier to use than these.
i'm found the hihy to be somewhat undersized vs. competitive suvs like pilot, flex or acadia and maybe even the cx-9.
but minivans are anything but "mini" these days — 200 inches long is the new norm — and only thetoyota sienna offers all-wheel drive.
what's more, handy second- and third-row release levers are found right there in the hatch area.
the key point here is that last year's 3.3-liter v6 has been replaced with a stouter 3.5-liter v6.
yes, we know; the sheet metal is essentially unchanged — this is a midcycle refresh, not an all-new generation.
the 2011 toyota highlander hybrid has a new 3.5-liter v6 engine and is rated at 28 mpg on the epa's combined scale.
i'm happy with the base model that had all the major features i wanted without stuff i didn't want, like moonroof, leather, power hatch, fake wood, auto climate, etc.
meanwhile, the non-hybrid 2011 highlander's non-atkinson 3.5-liter v6 still makes 270 hp.
we'll see come winter how it does.
i have yet to tally up the real world figures with a calculator but am pretty sure they aren't too far off.
because of the hybrid application, this isn't the same 3.5-liter v6 that "normal" highlanders have had for a few years.
it drives like a truck, has truck seats, and a truck interior.
the closest i found were the 4-cylinder, 2wd versions of smaller suvs like outlander, rav4 and sorrento that get 10-15% less at 24-25 mpg overall.
if i drop the requirement for seating down to 5 than a few more choices pop up (e.g. the subaru outback 2.5i - 24mpg low $30,000s) but even then it is only if i drop the requirement for awd that can i get fuel economy better than the hihy.
our spreadsheets tell us that paybacks approaching 10 years are common.
as you might expect, more total power makes the 2011 toyota highlander hybrid quicker.
cargo maximization with three rows all 2011 highlanders, hybrid or otherwise, now come standard with that third-row seat you want.
it reclines, it slides back and forth, and the central "20" section is removable (and stowable onboard) to create a center aisle and separate buckets with fold-down armrests.
it has electrically operated 4wd.
you'd take four-wheel drive if you could get it.
it charlesb says: 10:43 pm, 09/26/2010 you'd have to want to stay out of a minivan in the worst way to buy one of these.
amazing for a 7 passenger awd vehicle.
with all rear seats folded flat, maximum cargo space is 94 cubic feet, with 42.3 feet of that available behind the second row.
speed is all well and good, but the payoff in the cost equation comes from increased fuel economy.
the backup camera is all too useful.
the highlander hybrid changes direction when we turn the wheel, but that's the only way to know it's connected to anything because there's precious little sensory feedback through the column.
marksrig says: 11:21 pm, 03/22/2011 i recently bought the 2011 highlander hybrid and have run 2 tanks of gas through it.
making sense of things this 2011 toyota highlander hybrid limited won over more fans than we expected during its short stay with us.
if you're prepared to spend minivan money anyway, the 2011 toyota highlander hybrid starts to make a kind of sense.
i'll report back what i find.
spent four hours in it and aside from a few too many electrical assists and nannies (imo) this is a very nice, well-powered, able handling, comfortable suv at $34k out the door (that's a loaded limited,
at $40,780, this sienna starts out $2,975 less than the highlander hybrid and has a rated fuel economy of 18 mpg.
savings kick in after that, especially if gas prices rise.
and just a lot of little things that just scream "1st year of new generation vehicle."
the manufacturer provided edmunds this vehicle for the purposes of evaluation.
you'd take four-wheel drive if you could get it.
since the battery pack is small (this isn't a plug-in hybrid, after all), the amount of rear-drive assist is best imagined in tens of seconds, not tens of minutes.
but there are electric motors in play, and they boost peak power to 280 hp — 10 more than the 2010 highlander hybrid's net rating.
yes, bearsdkillz, they whacked this suv with an ugly stick inside and out.

i bit the bullet and traded in my 2006 hihy for a 2011 hihy a few weeks ago.
if you're going into this with a minivan budget but can make do with a little less size and space, the reworked 2011 toyota highlander hybrid starts to make a good deal of sense.
mazdaa says: 07:50 pm, 09/27/2010 the toyota highlander starts at 27390$ which is pretty cheap 4 a 3 row suv.
past highlander owners sighed mightily and drove off in a huff every time they walked out of costco with odd-shaped cargo.

as if to underscore the point, it slithers through our slalom at 60.2 mph and pulls 0.77g on our skid pad.

paid $300 over invoice a the time which wasn't bad for a dark color, though i had seen white and silver going for less than invoice price when dealers had more on the lots.
it can take serious time for gas savings to make up the difference.
bluetooth works well, but the voice interface is cumbersome compared to other vehicles, as are things like importing contacts.

last year's 3.3-liter highlander hybrid scored 26 mpg combined, with 27 mpg coming from the city and only 25 mpg coming from highway driving.
the best milage according to the display was 31.4.
the 2012 mazda 5 is similar in size and also gets 24mpg overall and the same 28mpg highway as the highlander hybrid, but a bit worse even than those smaller suvs around town at only 21mpg.
they couldn't be bothered to match the carpet and dash to the interior color.

my city doesnt plow my street until it hits the main road, and this systems seems a bit lacking.
the new nav systems does a much better job of telling you which lane to be in as highways and exits approach.
it now scoots to 60 mph in 7.4 seconds (7.1with 1 foot of rollout as on a drag strip), a half-second speedier than the last one we tested .
the benefits only exist over a relatively narrow rpm band, but that's cool here because the hybrid continuously variable transmission (cvt) can more or less choose any ratio it needs to keep mr. atkinson in his happy place.
the quarter-mile tells a similar story, where 15.4 seconds at 91.1 mph represents an improvement of 0.4 second.
our 2011 toyota highlander hybrid delivers this, too, thanks to the new engine and improved efficiencies in the hybrid drive system itself.

i hate how the equipment packages lay out - to get leather seats (a must for my wife) you have to get a jillion useless things (sunroof, power liftgate, accent lighting, etc.)
sure, the good ones use a lot less fuel than their conventional gasoline counterparts, but they cost more to buy, too.
but last year's seat had another problem: it was a one-piece all-or-nothing job when folding time came.
it comes standard with a third-row seat.
in my first tank i got just over 30mpg in 500 mixed city/highway miles.
bring your own pulse because you won't find one here.
there's enough to get going from a slippery intersection — the system engages when and if front-wheel slip is detected — but the rear-drive unit is not built to produce a prolonged boost up a long, slippery hill.
savings kick in after that, especially if gas prices rise.
we observed the same impeccably smooth and quiet ride, reasonable coordination and modest limits as before.
meanwhile, the non-hybrid 2011 highlander's non-atkinson 3.5-liter v6 still makes 270 hp.

in a panic stop, the added contribution of four-wheel disc brakes stops the show in 120 feet from 60 mph — quite respectable for a crossover suv riding on low-rolling-resistance tires.
the better milage i got was while in econ mode and of course keeping my foot out of the throttle except when really needed.
