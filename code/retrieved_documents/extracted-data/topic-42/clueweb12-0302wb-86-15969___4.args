“ford achieved a breakthrough with the ford fusion hybrid, and we intend to do this again for a new group of truck and suv buyers – customers we know very well.”
each company also will determine the calibration and performance dynamics characteristics of their respective light pickups and suvs.
in addition, as telematics plays an increasingly more important role in the in-car experience, both companies have agreed to collaborate on standards and technologies needed to enable a safer, more secure and more convenient in-car experience for next-generation telematics systems.
“by working together, we will be able to serve our customers with the very best affordable, advanced powertrains, delivering even better fuel economy,” said ford president and ceo alan mulally.
this new hybrid powertrain will bring the full hybrid experience of greater fuel efficiency to a new group of truck and suv customers without compromising the capability they require in their vehicles.
the telematics collaboration relates only to standards and technologies, and each company will continue to separately develop their own in-vehicle products and features.
“this agreement brings together the capability of two global leaders in hybrid vehicles and hybrid technology to develop a better solution more quickly and affordably for our customers,” said derrick kuzak, ford group vice president, global product development.
toyota president akio toyoda added: “toyota is extremely proud to join ford in developing a hybrid system for pickup trucks and suvs.
under the mou agreement, the two companies will bring the best of their independently developed hybrid powertrain technology and knowledge to a new co-developed hybrid system, which will be used in rear-wheel-drive light trucks arriving later this decade.
working together on in-vehicle standards can only enhance our customers’ experience with their vehicles.”
while the rear-wheel-drive hybrid system will share significant common technology and components, ford and toyota will individually integrate the system into their own vehicles.
uchiyamada added : “toyota has also invested heavily in telematics in various countries around the world, with services like the g-book and g-link.
