i can't afford it though, not without selling my soul...which maybe i could do, hmmm!
both will give you even more cash back if you choose factory financing.
the next trip they were out of priuses so we ended up with an upgrade to a mercedes -- and we had more trouble getting the luggage in there.
by philocrites on the heels of the los angeles times story that said that "subaru is the unitarian church of automotive brands," the fresno bee says that one uu congregation begs to differ:twenty-three people at the unitarian universalist church of fresno, california, drive toyota priuses.
channing would have noted, that pays for a lot of fill-ups, and with those incentives somebody's going to drive that car off the lot and burn that gas whether it's you or not.
like toyota, ford charges more for the hybrid upgrade than the fuel savings are worth.
we rented one to drive to oregon in october to help get out the vote, and our four suitcases and totebags etc.
each one becomes a free pass for its manufacturer to sell a few extra gas guzzlers...instead of simply saving gas when you buy a hybrid, you're giving somebody else the right to use it.
much as i am attached to my (second)subaru, i think the prius is more the uu car of choice.

buy an escape hybrid (or a prius), and you'll be like my friend "jeremiah's" orthodox quaker college classmate who used to pay extra in the 1950's and '60's to custom-order his new cars without so much chrome, because ostentatious show was against his religion.
so you can slide things in.
the prius is more 1970's, introspective, post-woodstock uu: it's so darned righteous and energy-conserving and self-image-affirming that its owners are willing to overlook the fact that it is actually pricedhigher than the present value of all the gas it will save, and you can't fit more than two grocery bags into it without squishing the bread.
me, i'm hoping ford's mazda subsidiary comes out with a twin mazda tribute hybrid model before my 1995 saab gives up the ghost.
too bad the benefits of our new cult car have been so exaggerated.... government policy, amazingly enough, seems almost intended to undercut the benefits of efficient cars.
it's a better compact for snow and off-road driving than the subaru, plus it's got a gas-sipping hybrid engine like the prius.
the tribute has a sport package that looks like it might be more fun to drive.
(incidentally, to compare the prices of the outback and prius is misleading.
fit in the back with no problem.
now there's a car that deserves a tax break.
the subaru is more old-fashioned 19th-century uu, in the tradition of channing, emerson, and thoreau: it's a rational, durable, reliable, value-priced purchase that can carry you through all kinds of bad weather and get you out into nature when you need to lie down in green pastures and walk beside still waters.
you can buy a similarly-equipped toyota corolla with pretty respectable mileage for alot less than what you have to pay for a prius, but you can't buy a prius with the outback's all-wheel drive at any price.)
the point isn't to save enough money to make it pay some mythical amount, it's to pollute less so we can all breathe.
if you don't need the hybrid feature, ford is offering $2,000 cash-back incentives on the standard-model escape, and mazda is offering $3,000 on the tribute.
it is an archived story now so it can't be linked to full-text.
car buyers could drive whatever they wanted, as long as they were paying the full cost of their gas, and automakers would respond with creative products....
the ford website even has a calculator to help you figure your annual fuel savings if you buy the hybrid.
they're not expensive as cars go, just too much for us in this bad economy.
as jon coifman, the media director of the natural resources defense council, says, ''we're not going to kick our oil addiction with good will and personal virtue.
february 16, 2006 01:55 pm | permalink for this comment i vote for prius, even though it doesn't actually make sense from a financial perspective, it is far more friendly to god's earth than the subaru because it is has much cleaner emissions.
a substantial gas tax would be the simplest, with other taxes being cut to keep down the overall burden.
