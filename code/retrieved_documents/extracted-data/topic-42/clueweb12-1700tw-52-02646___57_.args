they have undergone a revolution, and their vehicles reflect japanese attention to detail and quality control, along with european levels of handling and braking.tariffs and other informal barriers help special interests (in the auto industry, that would be fat-cat executives, shareholders and unions) while hurting customers.what’s changed is that a modern corolla is about a zillion times more refined, has sufficient go to be actually usable, won’t rust nearly as much, and will probably last 300,000 miles with maintenance.it’s not the responsibility of customers to buy an inferior vehicle in order to ensure that executives receive huge bonuses or uaw members never lose their jobs.cars like this offered better reliability, fuel economy, and more value than the likes of pintos, vegas, and chevettes.no, what the japanese have instituted – or, more accurately, what toyota instituted, and honda more or less copied – was a lean production system that improved product quality and lowered cost, benefiting customers, workers and shareholders.at any rate, one has to consider the number of pinto wagons that were on the road, and their safer fuel tank and fuel-filler tube design, when looking at the pinto’s fire-related death rate as a result of rear collisions.however, the dart and valiant were extremely sturdy and long-lived mechanically with the only real weakness being rust (something the toyota wasn’t immune to either).even though he concludes that there was some unacceptable risk to the pinto in terms of rear impacts with fire, i say that the overall number of these incidents is too tiny to really be statistically significant.there was nothing that made the contemporary corolla a better value than the pinto; they were both well-made by the standards of the time, both got roughly equal mileage from what i recall, and in the case of the pinto used proven mechanicals that had already been manufactured for years.unfortunately, government subsidies, over the long run, won’t outweigh lousy vehicles greenlighted by boneheaded management and produced by a spoiled union.ford, for example can build more vehicles with fewer people than it could in the 1990s (or 1970s), and with higher quality, to boot.and that is being driven by improved production processes and automation, not outsourcing.the pinto was more rust resistant than the japanese cars, but when it came to refinement and consistent quality control, the japanese easily won.the idea that the uaw is the backbone of the middle class, or that everyone suffers because uaw members have a higher co-payment for their prescriptions drugs, is a myth believed only by the gullible or the hopelessly stupid.
