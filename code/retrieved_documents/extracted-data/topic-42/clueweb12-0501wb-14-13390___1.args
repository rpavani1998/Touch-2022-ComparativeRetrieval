no fiesta engine is quiet though, while road and wind noise also join the cacophony.
engines include a gutless 1.25-litre and preferable 1.4-litre petrol, plus two tdci diesels - 1.4-litre and 1.6-litre.
see all makes you're in - car reviews: new reviews ford fiesta a best-selling supermini that is a top drive and roomy too, but could be quieter and better-equipped.
a four-star ncap result is par for this class, though a few rivals go one better.
servicing from a ford dealer (the largest network in the uk) should be cheap and painless, and there are so many fiestas around, finding parts will never be costly or difficult.
no fiesta is particularly well equipped though, and high-tech features such as voice activation and bluetooth telephone all cost extra.
again, the larger unit is better.
toping the range are 1.6-litre and 2.0-litre petrols, the latter with 150bhp.
marketplace: plentiful choice is sensibly grouped in easy-to-follow trims; style, lx, sporty zetec and luxurious ghia, with a racy st hot hatch range-topper.
ford build quality is good and the car's reliability record is good.

steering is crisp (all models have a leather wheel), corners are taken tidily and enthusiastically yet the ride remains supple too.
the st's engine is quicker but noisier than the 1.6-litre zetec-s too.
a class act, enhanced on the zetec s model to perfection.

ford really knows how to make cars handle, so even the cheapest fiesta will thrill the driver in you.

but supportive, high-set seats and a spot-on driving position pleases, making up for the lack of space for the clutch foot.
owning: retained values of the fiesta are average, but economy is good (even the 1.4-litre petrol averages 45mpg) and insurance ratings are ok.

but interior finish was much improved in 2006 when the car had a mild facelift.
