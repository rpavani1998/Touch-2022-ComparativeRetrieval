the 5.4 is a strong running engine with plenty of power for most any needs.the f-150 is quieter than ever before inside, and new steering bushings and dampers eliminate all engine vibrations in the steering wheel when the truck is sitting at idle.the 6-speed automatic is new for 2009, and a much needed addition that helped improve fuel mileage and made it easier to tow and pull hills with a load.six-way power seats, tilt steering and height-adjustable pedals allow a person of any size to drive the truck with no obstructions.four-wheel drive and advance trac with roll stability control each got a good workout while driving the truck in detroit's heavy snow, and both performed flawlessly.although the f-150's front end appears to be squared-off, the truck actually has a lower drag coefficient than its predecessors (a new tailgate with a spoiler-like top is part of the package that improve aerodynamics).gauges are large and situated for unobstructed display through the steering wheel, and the truck's center stack puts hvac controls within easy reach.ford engineers put plenty of thought into all aspects of the truck, from its performance to its fit to its ride.you might not need all of those systems at once on a typical drive, but if you do, they could prevent an accident.the transmission can be operated manually (like i did in deep snow), or put into "drive" when you don't want or need to fool around with shifting (when the selector is in "drive," you'll find that shifts are smooth and predictable).a large rear window and oversize outside mirrors remove all traces of a blind spot.ford brought in its new f-150s, toyota tundras, chevy silverados and dodge rams, setting up test tracks where drivers could compare the trucks one-on-one in different conditions.the f-150's console is large enough to hold a laptop and file folders, and a large glove box and door panel storage pockets add even more storage.my truck was equipped with navigation -- the system shares a screen with sirius satellite radio and the truck's sync voice control.i tested quick take-offs in an empty parking lot, and also turned the wheels while braking hard -- anti-lock brakes, traction control, roll stability and other systems did their jobs.
