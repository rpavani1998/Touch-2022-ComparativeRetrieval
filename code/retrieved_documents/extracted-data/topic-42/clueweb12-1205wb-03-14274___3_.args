the point of the exercise is to find the new vehicle that offers the most balanced performance to the four-wheeling enthusiast public.we're looking for the vehicles that do it all well, that present a terrific balance of trail and pavement manners and with the fewest tradeoffs or compromises in either direction.that's a careful definition, because if we were looking for the vehicle that provided the best trail performance, or the most hauling capacity, or the best highway manners, well, that would greatly narrow the focus of what we're trying to accomplish.quantifying those benefits, and apportioning kudus where they are deserved, is the point of four wheeler of the year.when you improve on an already high standard of excellence, everybody benefits.if we focused on trail performance only, for instance, it would mean that a jeep might win every year.we'd be happy to own and wheel any one of them.as much as we admire jeeps of all stripes, that would not serve our interests, or yours.this crop was composed of the hummer h2, the toyota 4runner, the kia sorento, the lexus gx470, the ford excursion, the jeep wrangler rubicon and the mitsubishi montero.just when we get to thinking that factory-fresh four-wheelers can't get any better, they get better.and frankly, all were, in their own ways, really excellent.four wheeler, february, 2009 tweet just when we get to thinking that factory-fresh four-wheelers can't get any better, they get better.
