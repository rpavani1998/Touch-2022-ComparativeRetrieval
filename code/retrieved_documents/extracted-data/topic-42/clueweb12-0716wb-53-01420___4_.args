diesels belch out just 1/2 of 1% of the pollutants they did just 7 years age.it's still one of the most affordable pickups out there, although its base 159-hp engine is bested by much of the competition.the base 185-hp four-cylinder engine is more powerful than its direct competition, but it's also larger and thirstier.the midsize dodge pickup features a 3.7l magnum v6 as standard equipment, with a 4.7l v8 being the more enticing option, albeit one that would knock the dakota off this list.when we tested the ridgeline, we found that its pleasant highway manners were a slight consolation for its sub-par abilities as a utility or off-road truck.the goal is a fuel-efficient diesel that can power a full-size pickup.luckily, the entry-level 4.0l v6 received a boost in power for 2011, now good for 270 hp and 278 lb-ft of torque.all base price: $18,200 the numbers: 23 mpg hwy, 19 mpg city, 21 mpg overall the tradeoff: the tennessee-builtnissan frontier has enjoyed moderate success since its introduction in 1997, perhaps in part thanks to its attempt at rugged "tonka truck" styling, and despite its relative lack of standard options compared to the competition.watch video: 2010 chevrolet colorado base price: $17,595 the numbers: 23 mpg hwy, 19 mpg city, 21 mpg overall the tradeoff: like the nissan frontier on which it's based, the suzuki equator is the underdog player in the entry-level pickup truck arena, although its 7-year/100,000-mile warranty is definitely a plus.simply sit in a car and compare the ergonomics, the logical display of the controls, etc.we haven't tested the 2011dakota yet, but it is much the same middle-of-the-road truck that it was last year.i like to see foreign trucks introduce new ideas that take a hold in the market.the best trucks on the road these 8 pickups each have characteristics that set apart from the rest.if that doesnâ€™t convince you, open a consumer reports or consumer digest and look at the ratings for the reliability alone.i am sure the consumer would like to know that bit of information before buying a new vehicle.
