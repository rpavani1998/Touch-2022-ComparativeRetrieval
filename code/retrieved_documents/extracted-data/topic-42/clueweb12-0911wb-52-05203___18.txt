if your still uncertain, you could offer it as a special order and see what the demand is.
seems toyota did offer an automatic awd with a high and low range in the  new 2011 toyota land cruiser.
last redesigned for the 2008 model year, the land cruiser typically  stretches its lifecycle updates out over a longer period than most toyota  models.

why can't toyota be the first to do the usa a solid, and provide a 2012/2013  diesel fj that gets 25 city/35 hwy mpg for the outdoors man.
full production is expected  to start sometime in 2011 for the 2012 model year.

if you wanted to bump-up performance you could easily do  it by adding a 3" exhaust system to the d4-d diesel and t-week your chip  controlled fuel/air chip settings.

the voodoo blue ones always catch my eye and primarily drew my interest to the fj design.

especially for the lumbar support, and having a height adjustment would be excellent.
the orange cone yellow sucked.
the point being, that with very little effort toyota could produce a 2012 or 2013 vastly improved diesel fj that could run in the 25 city/35 hwy mpg range and offer an improved torque range, over the current version, to the outdoors enthusiasts with realistic and substantial every day fuel savings.

toyota tundra 2013 toyota tundra: after a mild refresh for the 2010 model year, the  tundra pickup isn't likely to see any major upgrades until the 2013 model year  at the earliest.
