if you read the manual it says that for the first 2000 miles your mileage will be lower than the epa estimates and then will slowly rise and the level off (it has something to do with the conditioning of the battery).
do some research, there are many people with not as high mpg on the fusion.
the 43 mpg they achieved was on a carefully scripted route by ford, and not more than some 60 miles in the car.
frankly, i'm sick of you guys comparing everything to a ferrari.
i have had major problems with the toyotas i've owned: mushy cornering, broken a/c's, windows that quit working (major irritation), fabric that falls out and hangs, sun visors that won't stay where you put them, water pumps that quit working for no reason, battery connections that corrode continuously and have to be replaced, the list goes on.
ford is crap, plain and simple and i am sorry many biased americans fail to see it.
am i can tell you as an owner of the 2009 camry hybrid that toyota give customers that expect reliability and a reasonable ride exactly what we want.
darn, there goes getting added to ford's christmas card list yet again.
and simply put, the fusion delivers those subjective goods better than any hybrid on the market.
toyota's tax credit expired last year.
http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/cars/used-cars/reliability/best-worst-in-car-reliability-1005/most-least-reliable-new-cars/0704_most-least-reliable-new-cars.htm and even jd power places toyota above ford in quality and dependability.
and as for my pick, i'd still go with the fusion-- according to consumer reports, it is very reliable, and it is impressively efficient.
the only thing i do different is i start from standing stops a bit more slowly than before, based on the feedback from the green leaves.
i have driven my fusion hybrid now for 3000+ with no mileage reset and it is still averaging 42.7...better than advertised.
nice try though, but i find the fusion design to be a bit gooey looking.
all-in-all, i am very happy with my purchase.
ford is a solid ride.
i would buy an american based car if their quality ever improves to the same level as the toyota brand.
you must one of the many biased americans who cannot see the truth.
trouble is, our early observations have thefusion's overall number floating around 33.5 mpg.
although the epa has come a long way in rehabilitating its reputation as a creditable source of mileage numbers, that newfound respectability could be suffering a hiccup with the all-new,2010 ford fusion hybrid.
fords are not solid, and according to consumer reports, they are not as highly ranked as the competition from toyota, honda, nissan, vw, subarau, and even mazda which they partly own.
most of car magazines i have read so far have always said the fusion is way more fuel-efficient in real world mileage.
i looked that the fusion, and drove it, but i was not impressed with the car at all.
if you read past the headline hype of autoblog's review, they freely admit that most real world driving would be in the 35-37 mpg range.
in the end, toyota would have my money.
i keep up with traffic and don't annoyingly hypermile...and i'm averaging 42.7!
" with the similar size, power and mpg numbers during your comparison test, i too am perplexed by the epa estimate of 41/36 for the fusion hybrid especially considering it has a smaller electric motor and greater weight.
good luck to anyone that buys the fusion, you will certainly need it when it breaks down on you.
the camry hybrid was a good vehicle for it's day, but it's vanilla in 2009 and as of this moment now the fusion is at least this year the honest winner.
it is by far a superior vehicle, and best of all it is made by an american company.
you supported the junk they build.
kept almost every one of them well over 200k and bought another one.
ford should stay alive so they can continue to make good looking cars.
as mr. cherian points out, the primary benefit of a hybrid is its recapture of kinetic energy otherwise lost to braking.
the fusion is definatly way better.
but it's not so loud as to be annoying.
the most interesting part was the mileage differences between mt and epa.
the 33.5 mpg you logged during your fusion hybrid test should also "be regarded as the lead-foot basement of the scale" but it seems very unlikely the fusion hybrid will achieve the epa numbers (38.5) in real-driving.
i am here to either throw fuel on this fire or help put it out.
hey, that's an excellent result in our book.
syj - 01/13/09 10:27 am fusion looks better and has better handling and full tax credit.
short story fusion wipes the floor with camry.
operate as an ev up to as high a speed as possible in the city and have its engine's relighting be unnoticeable.
other drivers, carefully following the ecoguide displays, were able to record city averages of more of 43 mpg on a similar route""" bbkk - 01/09/09 12:40 pm
however, i must admit, based on looks; focus is better, way better.
the editors like the fusion better.
coffeejolts - 01/19/09 01:37 am seems like everyone + dog except mt is getting the claimed mpg from the fusion.
this car is definitely a winner, even if the sticker price is slightly higher than the toyota's the tax credit should bring it close or even lower than the toyota.
the guy that said ford is crap obviously hasn't driven one outside of a rental fleet.
lets not forget the current camry hybrid is based on 4 year old technology and toyota will be bringing out a new prius for 2010, which will undoubtedly find its way into the next camry as well.
so it is actually cheaper then the official granny mobile, much better looking, and you would be supporting american jobs if you bought it, camry hybrid is built in japan, not the us of a btw.
the volume level of its ev-audio experience has just enough whine to provide that vital soundtrack of efficiency.
i have owned fords for years and have had no major problem.
i think both these cars are winners, i like how long they went with it (i think it was because they were trying to make a case for the fusion)
proverbs - 01/09/09 11:53 am cut to the chase: in the comparison of mileage and performance, the camry won.
: but first, we'll cut to the chase and right up front anoint the fusion as our overall pick of the two.
although the epa has come a long way in rehabilitating its reputation as a creditable source of mileage numbers, that newfound respectability could be suffering a hiccup with the all-new,2010 ford fusion hybrid.
good job ford, but toyota continues to impress...
looks much better though.
if it performs as well as you've shown, it is only stepping up to the competition and will be trailing again with a camry redesign.
compared with thecamry hybrid, its willingness to remain in ev mode is delightful (up to 47 mph while tickling the accelerator -- see our graphic of measurements gleaned from obd2 port to prove it).
it looks better and it provides the same all around performance than the camry.
and if you read consumer reports, which i don't believe you ever have, they have said countless times, that ford has shown the most improvement out of all the american companies and their quality is just as good as toyrota and honda.
of the least reliable, 29 belonged to america and 2 belonged to japanese.
i have owned 4 fords in the past, all of them were terrible vehicles that on many occassions left me stranded.
on-board generation of electricity for filling in the engine's torque holes and whatnot, offers a smaller bang for the technological buck (the electricity's chemical storage and recovery involve not-inconsiderable losses).
trouble is, our early observations have thefusion's overall number floating around 33.5 mpg.

most likely because it's cheaper, faster, more fuel efficient in real life
with toyota, you will not need it.
you should take off moderate to the speed limit and then go into electric this will charge your battery and give longer all electric driving and with good charge 47 mph is easy for a short distance.
on-board generation of electricity for filling in the engine's torque holes and whatnot, offers a smaller bang for the technological buck (the electricity's chemical storage and recovery involve not-inconsiderable losses).
shut its engine down very quickly when it decelerates.
additionally you can drive this car very aggressively and and average 37-38 with a mix of city and highway.
and furthermore the only fords that you have probably ever owned is a 80's tempo or an early 90's taurus.
drive a real car and you'll see the difference.
the mileage on the outbound segment was 54 mpg, and on the way back was 55 mpg.
shut its engine down very quickly when it decelerates.
"""during the launch drive, i attempted to game the results by gunning away from stoplights and generally doing everything i could to burn up gas and electricity.
maybe customers will be willing to change driving habits to get those kinds of numbers.. trdtundra - 01/11/09 06:01
funny a list from consumer reports shows the most and least reliable cars/trucks.
although the taillights on the fusion look similar to the ones on the subaru legacys, which is somewhat disappointing.
my camry in the dc area gets 41 mpg on a trip going 70 mph and it gets 36.5 mpg going to work and back.
although if i were to get a hybrid, i would pass by both the fusion and the camry and head straight toward the new insight and save my cash.
according to the numbers above and again printed here, the camry is overall better.
i go 35-40 in all electric for miles with no problem driving like this.
praveen calmly followed up.
and the trunk space is also noticeably less impacted by its battery pack.
donâ€™t ever put found on road dead vehicles on the same level as any japanese competitor.
you and your *** car lovin buddies are the main reason the american auto industry is in the shape it is in.
for the first 1-2k i was averaging around 34mpg on the highway and around 39mpg in the city.
dsavio - 01/11/09 08:19 pm http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-neil19-2008dec19,0,1742816.story dan neil from la times get 52.8 mpg during media drives of the ford fusion hybrid.
notably, the pressure to meet these hybrid expectations is now so high that manufacturers will knowingly trade a little efficiency to deliver those experiential goods.
i get anything from 30's to 70's in town driving depending on the charge of the battery and what accessories are running.
trdsmokedu - 02/09/09 05:19 pm fordtrucks, you and your redneck friends are the reason the american auto industry is the way it is.
while our early experience suggests the real-world mileages of the fusion and gold-standardcamry are closer than ford might like, that doesn't mean the fusion still isn't the better hybrid (and potentially capable of super mileage).
i have never had a problem with a ford...ever...in 30 years of driving them.
in the car and driver comparo, the ford fusion actually beat out the camry in fuel economy!
trdtundra - 01/19/09 06:15 pm coffee, i have driven and owned many fords, and i stand-by my opinion, they are crap.
if i hyper mile i can achieve 50's to 60's in town on tank after tank.
yep, the camry may be plain, but according to consumer reports, the overall reliability and depreciation is much better than a crappy ford.
this is in michigan, so the expressways are pretty flat, but i live in ann arbor, so the local driving has a lot of rolling hills.
i really don't think they had to be becayse the fusion does hold its own against the camry and did beat the camry in some areas.
start by receiving a no-hassle quote for auto financing.
seriously, if it wasn't for the bias, ford would have improved its quality decades ago because they would have been hurting so bad!
next, you guys make a terrible assumption that people won't change their driving behavior when behind the wheel of these things.
solosoldier - 01/16/09 03:49 am i'm with the camry because in 2 years, it will be redesigned while the fusion will still be on this platform.
in my opionion though the camry is still the better pick here.
this way you can get your facts straight because mine are.
and simply put, the fusion delivers those subjective goods better than any hybrid on the market.
(in all of their epa tests of all cars) that said, the fusion achieved 45 mpg on the other front page story today, versus the altima hybrid, in cold weather too!
ford is far from solid a solid turd maybe but that is pushing it.
chaise1984 - 01/09/09 01:36 pm i find it funny that the camry pretty won won outright on everything, but still wanted to make the fusion win.
however, the gas mileage difference is perceptible...in fact it's significant.
with that said i still think both cars are winner, and the import fans and dom fans should just chill, we all know you will only buy for you home team.
its got better performance, better new technology, and better gas efficiency.
of course, that's not to say that the fusion hybrid isn't a great piece of work by ford overall, by all accounts it is.
hey, that's an excellent result in our book.
start by receiving a no-hassle quote for auto insurance.
as mr. cherian points out, the primary benefit of a hybrid is its recapture of kinetic energy otherwise lost to braking.
it should start up exclusively in ev mode.
even if the fusion supposedly won it will probably be short-lived.
this was one piece that was too long, drawn out and a bit boring.
compared with thecamry hybrid, its willingness to remain in ev mode is delightful (up to 47 mph while tickling the accelerator -- see our graphic of measurements gleaned from obd2 port to prove it).
while our early experience suggests the real-world mileages of the fusion and gold-standardcamry are closer than ford might like, that doesn't mean the fusion still isn't the better hybrid (and potentially capable of super mileage).
it seemed like the same typical ford of the past which in a short time will fall apart and cost way more to maintain.
something that people like you don't do on a regular basis, and when something breaks it is automatically ford's fault or gm's fault that they didn't engineer a vehicle that you can just drive without even changing the oil.
keep drinking that coffee, it has obviously gotten to your brain.
i've had many fords, and all have been good, solid vehicles.
cleeto78 - 01/10/09 01:54 am one more thing, "the most glaring difference is probably the fusion's hollow door handle thunk when it's released - what a silly thing to allow into production."
if the fusion performs like the epa says and possibly even better by the drivers at fueleconomy.gov, it will have set a new bar for mid-size hybrids.
since my car was made in kentucky, i feel that i gave americans the work to build my car.
the fusion was middle-ground in acceleration, had the best mpg, and it qualifies for a tax credit(the fusion)
in all honesty, i would still buy the camry hybrid.
so the camry was faster, more efficient, and cheaper, plus no 1st year teething issues, plus higher resale.
recording more than 40 mpg on the fusion's trip computer is not hard if you work at it, see frank markus' blog for more on that: http://blogs.motortrend.com/6412966/green/cold-weather-hybrid-mpg-test-ford-fusion-hybrid-vs-nissan-altima-hybrid/index.html kim reynolds spent 500 miles in the car, and drove it in a number of different real world scenarios.
if you like the *** cars so much go live in japan.
my friend that drives a camry hybrid in similar fashion gets 36 (and hers mpg guage auto-resets with every tank...
stvdude - 12/31/09 12:31 pm the fusion is the better hybrid panhandlewilly - 12/04/09 07:56 am trd, i know this is some months oldâ€¦but only a numbers geek, you, would ascribe any meaningful difference between the acceleration figures you quote.
darn, there goes getting added to ford's christmas card list yet again.
all reliable evidence clearly points to the ford being a superior vehicle.
the camrys, although from toyota which was started in japan, are providing jobs for americans and tax to the american government.
of the most reliable cars 37 out of 47 belonged to japanese cars, 3 for america.
providing the final nudge to the scale are the ford's nifty new reconfigurable instrument pod, and more important, the fusion's notably more involving driving experience.
click to view gallery "about 500 miles of typical mixed use -- highway driving, city driving; you know, everything you'd do with a car."
i mostly drive around town, and my average after four months and 2500 miles is 41.3 mpg.
however, a few years from now when toyota revamps the camry hybrid, it will be much improved.
it took ford long enough to catch up with toyota in the hybrid game and hopefully they'll stay up to task.
i get mid 40's on the highway without doing anything except stay at 70 and below.
click to view gallery "about 500 miles of typical mixed use -- highway driving, city driving; you know, everything you'd do with a car."
we have driven the fusion hybrid for 8,000 miles and have had zero problems with it.
this is the very first time that a car magazine says the fusion isn't that fuel-efficient!
the volume level of its ev-audio experience has just enough whine to provide that vital soundtrack of efficiency.
operate as an ev up to as high a speed as possible in the city and have its engine's relighting be unnoticeable.
this winter, when the engine had to run more to keep the body and batteries warm, we averaged 35 mpg mostly highway with about 25% city, now that it is warmer i usually get 38.5 mpg on the highway at 75 mph and get 41 mpg if i drive at 65 instead.
i drive 31 miles to work one-way during rush hour on a us route with way too many stoplights, but it's flat.
and the trunk space is also noticeably less impacted by its battery pack.
in short only a *** cool-aid drinkin, hype believing, storefront 'truck guy,' numbers geek, you, thinks the camry hybrid could be a better car.
now if i watch my gauges religiously i am able to get in the high 50s and mid 60s for city but no matter what i average 38 on the highway.
notably, the pressure to meet these hybrid expectations is now so high that manufacturers will knowingly trade a little efficiency to deliver those experiential goods.
it is best not to take off like a snail this uses up battery charge.
yeah i gotta cheer for the home team on this one, the fusion is clearly better in every way/shape/form.
the us camry hybrid is made in kentucky -rwc- - 01/09/09 10:49 pm oh ya, the camry hybrid doesnt qualify for a tax credit anymore.
