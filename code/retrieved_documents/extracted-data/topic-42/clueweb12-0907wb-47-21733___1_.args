our 2011 toyota highlander hybrid delivers this, too, thanks to the new engine and improved efficiencies in the hybrid drive system itself.the interior is flexible and comfortable, it finally has a useful third row and interior controls don't get any more logical or easier to use than these.speed is all well and good, but the payoff in the cost equation comes from increased fuel economy.at $40,780, this sienna starts out $2,975 less than the highlander hybrid and has a rated fuel economy of 18 mpg.it consumes fuel at an average pace of 19 mpg.bluetooth works well, but the voice interface is cumbersome compared to other vehicles, as are things like importing contacts.bottom line:the highlander hybrid may just be the perfect choice for families that want a hybrid powertrain and three rows of seating but don't need or want a minivan.there's enough to get going from a slippery intersection — the system engages when and if front-wheel slip is detected — but the rear-drive unit is not built to produce a prolonged boost up a long, slippery hill.it can take serious time for gas savings to make up the difference.as mentioned already, no other 3-row vehicle with a v6 comes close to the overall fuel economy.backup cam and bluetooth with streaming audio are standard.as expected, the regenerative braking system emits the same faint keening produced by every other toyota hybrid.as you might expect, more total power makes the 2011 toyota highlander hybrid quicker.conventional wisdom would pit this against its v6 gasoline equivalent, the 2011 highlander limited 4wd, which costs some $6,600 less.our non-hybrid v6 highlander also has a towing capacity of 5,000 lbs, which is 1,500 more than the hybrid version.
