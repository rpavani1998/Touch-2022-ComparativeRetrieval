toyota president akio toyoda  added: “toyota is extremely proud to join ford in developing a hybrid  system for pickup trucks and suvs.
“we have unique and very good solutions today with sync and myfordtouch.
the two companies also agreed to work together on  enablers to complement each company’s existing telematics platform  standards, helping bring more internet-based services and useful information to  consumers globally.
in the u.s., we have just introduced the accessible, easy-to-use entune.
“this is the kind of collaborative effort that is  required to address the big global challenges of energy independence and  environmental sustainability.”
each company also will determine the calibration and performance dynamics characteristics of their respective light pickups and suvs.
“this agreement brings together the capability of two global leaders in hybrid vehicles and hybrid technology to develop a better solution more quickly and affordably for our customers,” said derrick kuzak, ford group vice president, global product development.
under the mou agreement, the two companies will bring the best of their independently developed hybrid powertrain technology and knowledge to a new co-developed hybrid system, which will be used in rear-wheel-drive light trucks arriving later this decade.
