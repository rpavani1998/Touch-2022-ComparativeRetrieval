the exterior is attractive, the interior offers more than any of its competitors, and that is all it will take to attract buyers.this much improved interior and new found style should increase retail customer percentage.one of the things that made impala a legend was it's strong engine, and if this car will only provide moderate performance it will also be considered a dud in the future (like the current generation impala).other safety features include forward collision alert, lane departure warning, side blind zone alert, and rear cross traffic alert, which use either radar or cameras to detect various hazards and alert the driver.through this touch screen, drivers can interface with chevy’s available mylink system, which incorporates bluetooth hands-free phone and streaming audio, plus optional navigation.the door panels and dashboard get soft-touch materials, while the seats are meant to look more premium than the old model with higher-quality stitching.the 2014 model offers full-speed-range adaptive cruise control that can come to a complete stop and accelerate again depending on traffic movement in front of the vehicle.gm’s collision mitigation braking system – another chevy first – can apply the brakes automatically if a crash is imminent.click to view gallery gm says the new impala’s stronger structure enhances the quietness of the full-size sedan’s passenger compartment, and improves the handling and ride.a central 4.2-inch color display within the wraparound instrument cluster relays the driver information, while an 8-inch touch screen with a hidden storage compartment behind it adorns the center stack.if this car falls in the league of toyota avalon & ford taurus, then the new 2013 ford taurus is tighter, cohesive and better looking car.but with the all-new 2014 chevrolet impala making its world debut at the 2012 new york auto show, the bow tie brand is promising to erase memories of the long-running nameplate’s largely forgettable outgoing model with a more refined interior, the latest in technology, and a vastly improved driving experience when it goes on sale in early 2013.those numbers are up slightly from the 3.6-liter engine in the current impala, which produces 300 hp and 262 lb-ft.everything will hinge on materials and build quality.gm is addressing that issue in the new model by employing high-quality fabrics, ultrasuede, and perforated leather inside the cabin of the 2014 impala.
