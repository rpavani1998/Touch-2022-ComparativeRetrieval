toyota president akio toyoda added: “toyota is extremely proud to join ford in developing a hybrid system for pickup trucks and suvs.
“we have unique and very good solutions today with sync and myfordtouch.
the two companies also agreed to work together on enablers to complement each company’s existing telematics platform standards, helping bring more internet-based services and useful information to consumers globally.
each company also will determine the calibration and performance dynamics characteristics of their respective light pickups and suvs.
“this agreement brings together the capability of two global leaders in hybrid vehicles and hybrid technology to develop a better solution more quickly and affordably for our customers,” said derrick kuzak, ford group vice president, global product development.
under the mou agreement, the two companies will bring the best of their independently developed hybrid powertrain technology and knowledge to a new co-developed hybrid system, which will be used in rear-wheel-drive light trucks arriving later this decade.
working together on in-vehicle standards can only enhance our customers’ experience with their vehicles.”

in addition, as telematics plays an increasingly more important role in the in-car experience, both companies have agreed to collaborate on standards and technologies needed to enable a safer, more secure and more convenient in-car experience for next-generation telematics systems.
specifically, ford and toyota will: for years, both ford and toyota have been working independently on similar new rear-wheel-drive hybrid systems aimed at delivering higher fuel economy in light trucks and suvs.
specifically, ford and toyota will: jointly develop as equal partners a new rear-wheel drive hybrid system and component technology for light trucks and suvs independently integrate the new hybrid system in their future vehicles separately
“we have unique and very good solutions today with sync and myfordtouch.
this rear-wheel-drive hybrid system will be based on an all-new architecture to deliver the capability truck and suv customers demand while providing greater fuel economy.
the telematics collaboration relates only to standards and technologies, and each company will continue to separately develop their own in-vehicle products and features.
