ford and toyota believe that their collaboration will allow them to bring these hybrid technologies to customers sooner and more affordably than either company could have accomplished alone.this new hybrid powertrain will bring the full hybrid experience of greater fuel efficiency to a new group of truck and suv customers without compromising the capability they require in their vehicles.this rear-wheel-drive hybrid system will be based on an all-new architecture to deliver the capability truck and suv customers demand while providing greater fuel economy.not only is this tie-up clearly one aimed at making automobiles ever better, it should also become an important building block for future mobility in the u.s. by building a global, long-term relationship with ford, our desire is to be able to continue to provide people in america automobiles that exceed their expectations.”not only is this tie-up clearly one aimed at making automobiles ever better, it should also become an important building block for future mobility in the u.s.while the rear-wheel-drive hybrid system will share significant common technology and components, ford and toyota will individually integrate the system into their own vehicles.working together on in-vehicle standards can only enhance our customers’ experience with their vehicles.”under the mou agreement, the two companies will bring the best of their independently developed hybrid powertrain technology and knowledge to a new co-developed hybrid system, which will be used in rear-wheel-drive light trucks arriving later this decade.“by working together, we will be able to serve our customers with the very best affordable, advanced powertrains, delivering even better fuel economy,” said ford president and ceo alan mulally.“this agreement brings together the capability of two global leaders in hybrid vehicles and hybrid technology to develop a better solution more quickly and affordably for our customers,” said derrick kuzak, ford group vice president, global product development.specifically, ford and toyota will: jointly develop as equal partners a new rear-wheel drive hybrid system and component technology for light trucks and suvs independently integrate the new hybrid system in their future vehicles separatelyspecifically, ford and toyota will: for years, both ford and toyota have been working independently on similar new rear-wheel-drive hybrid systems aimed at delivering higher fuel economy in light trucks and suvs.in addition, as telematics plays an increasingly more important role in the in-car experience, both companies have agreed to collaborate on standards and technologies needed to enable a safer, more secure and more convenient in-car experience for next-generation telematics systems.the telematics collaboration relates only to standards and technologies, and each company will continue to separately develop their own in-vehicle products and features.“ford achieved a breakthrough with the ford fusion hybrid, and we intend to do this again for a new group of truck and suv buyers – customers we know very well.”
