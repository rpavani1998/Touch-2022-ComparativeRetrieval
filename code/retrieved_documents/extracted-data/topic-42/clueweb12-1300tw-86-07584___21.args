the 2014 model offers full-speed-range adaptive cruise control that can come to a complete stop and accelerate again depending on traffic movement in front of the vehicle.
impala's shouldn't have 4 cylinders, it just is too small for a car that size.
i at least had hope...a front wheel drive impala only conveys to the suspense-held public what everyone feared; that absolutely nothing has changed.
gm’s collision mitigation braking system – another chevy first – can apply the brakes automatically if a crash is imminent.
current car tops out around $31k or so.
i dont care how many current impalas are sold to rental agencies, this one looks good.
pm think it has been improved and agree some of the design is busy.
but the ride will say more.
at first i thought wow nice than i thought, again not the car i was hoping it would turn out to be not edgey enough.
i hope it does'nt have the cave type of appearance of the lacrosse in person and that if in the drivers seat one has good visiblility all around.
i think gm has created another huge improvement in its line up.
inyurahsya - 04/04/12 12:08 pm it looks like a 4-door camaro with the rear of a cruze.
this car is going to be much more expensive with all the bells and whistles and its brand new.
i do however wonder what the advantage of eassist is when the normal 4-banger will produce more hp and similar fuel economy numbers in the real world.
someone mentioned the azera- the hyundai is attractive but still derivative of existing asian luxury cars.
it just doesn't work - some colors make this thing look profoundly cheap.
i see this as being a huge sales success soon after hitting the market.
where as the split grill will be for the more “economical” vehicles.
i believe the taurus, avalon, cc, and maxima compete with the impala.
unfortunately, we'll see a flood of these on the roads as soon as gm pumps budget & hertz rental fleets full of these.
lasvegascolonel - 04/04/12 12:35 pm having lived through the great impalas that were large cars, v8s, stylish, coupes, and breathtaking in many ways, i wouldn't normally praise these kid hauler impalas (sedans), but this is nicely styled and i would consider this over a more bland camry or accord.
to be honest, full sized sedans should not have such weak power-trains to began with in 2012.
inyurahsya - 04/04/12 12:08 pm it looks like a 4-door camaro with the rear of a cruze.
the exterior is attractive, the interior offers more than any of its competitors, and that is all it will take to attract buyers.
this thing is all its own your brain is lying to you side by side pictures of what youre saying it looks like and youll feel stupid capitals - 04/04/12 01:46 pm overall a nice car inside/outside, but the four cylinders, i don't know maybe the turbo with 270hp will be okay in this car.
a little more "oomph" (30+hp and lots of torque) from the electric motor would be nice though in such a large car.
the rest looks pretty good and it's definitely different.
i liked it in pictures but in person it looked terrible.
it looks like they glued doilies randomly all over it.
i mean hello they did a great job making the camaro!
whoever thinks this is ugly has no clue what they are talking about.
the steering wheel in that car was gorgeous (imo).
am not a bad looking car inside and out, but mostly targeted at the rentals, and the ford taurus and avalons of the world.
a nice thick, leather wrapped wheel with a simple three spoke design and tasteful metal accenting.
that said, i think for what this car is intended to be, it executes it quite well.
the new acadia has a steering wheel from 1990, as does the traverse, escalade etc.
pm would be far better it came with a v-8 and rear drive.
cp_09malibuv6 - 04/04/12 07:15 am i like how this design wont overshadow the handsome new malibu, the way the new malibu makes the cruze look cheaper by comparison.
the interior looks great and the front end is ok but the rear door just looks awful.
i like the azera's design better.
i would have left the instrument cluster hood the same color as the rest of the dash, but other than those two things, this car looks great.
am it's a huge improvement over the current impala, but the 2013 ford fusion still looks better.
it would be even better if it was rwd.
niether car looks bad but this just seems more masculine and american looking.
the long, raked-back profile is meant to pay homage to past impalas, while still providing a contemporary look.
plus, gm's powertrain warranty matches chrysler's...better than ford or toyota.
although i do suspect that chevy will raise the price some on this car, i hope they don't raise it too much.
and i can only assume they will offer an upcoming twin-turbo v6 when ready, the lesser one i assume would be enough.
i really think the designers of this slept with the designers of the new avalon ( and, maybe the azera, as well)
those numbers are up slightly from the 3.6-liter engine in the current impala, which produces 300 hp and 262 lb-ft.
the cafe regs are making cars lame again like they did in the late 1970's.
i can't help but notice how much it looks like the current azera though.. almost like they had the azera on hand when they were designing this car.
the v6s are what people buy anyway, not the hemi models.
looks like some kind of california ghetto carpeted dash cover you buy from jc whitney for $39.
gm could have done a better job on the dash pad, it appears to be an afterthought.
look at compeitors like the taurus and the passat.
front-wheel drive is for bargain, commuter cars, nothing more.
great combination for the road warriors that want good comfortable reliable transportation with some power.
am i can't wait for the 2014 chevrolet impala, this should be a fantastic car.
the rest looks pretty good and it's definitely different.
am i stopped reading once i got to "the car will be offered exclusively in front-wheel drive..." wake me up from this nightmare when gm decides to make it rwd.
even more comforting than the design is the fact that the malibu and impala finally do not overlap.
either way the impala looks good, the interior in the 9th generation was horrible, the 8th gen was better.
syj - 04/04/12 12:23 pm reading through the comments you can see who is being realistic and honest and who is offering mindless impala bashing.
i just read on another website that awd will not be offered on the impala.
a rwd car would of sealed the deal.
the people who buy this car not only do not care if it is fwd, rwd, or awd, they likely do not know the difference.
lay off the sauce name one car in this segment that has a more masculine front end.
start by receiving a no-hassle quote for auto insurance.
it's a great looking car.
am and please tell me why this is not a direct competitor with the malibu.
fwd and sick, wheezy little engines tugging around 2 tons of flab.
it does look more like a buick-wannabe or hyundai than a chevy, but lately, that's been a good thing.
i'm still not a fan of chevy tan and brown interiors and their tacky "ambient lighting" but i'd say that the avalon and azera has their work cut out for them.
nah, it's interior doesn't look as good.
35mpg is good though for such a large car.
looks pretty sharp, and that interior seems pretty fantastic.
notalwaysbeengood - 04/04/12 09:06 am better looking than the last car by a country mile, but i find the side sculpting too busy, and the same with the interior.
major props to the design team both in and out.
looks so much better than the previous model.
again chevy is making the impala to compete and not dominate.
anyways, i hope they do not do that to the impala... seano0 - 04/01/12 07:50 pm it would be huge for gm to offer this in awd.
since an ss would need the (developing) 3.6l twin-turbo, and awd to handle the power.
i believe styling is behind 2013 malibu just like taurus is behind 2013 fusion.
the hood gets a slight power bulge, intended to convey a look of performance.
to be honest, full sized sedans should not have such weak power-trains to began with in 2012.
the curves and bulging fenders are a long way from the old slab-sided design language.
once i got to "the car will be offered exclusively in front-wheel drive..." wake me up from this nightmare when gm decides to make it rwd.
someone mentioned the azera- the hyundai is attractive but still derivative of existing asian luxury cars.
pm would be far better it came with a v-8 and rear drive.
even more comforting than the design is the fact that the malibu and impala finally do not overlap.
it's still a pretty vanilla-looking car (not really a deal-killer considering how bland its closest competitors all look), but i admit it looks gorgeous when compared to the outgoing impala.
although the photos depict a loaded ltz, it looks as though chevy may have gotten this one right for a change.
the impala now comes standard with 18-inch wheels (steel or alloy, depending on trim), with 19- and 20-inch alloys available.
those headlamps feature hids on the ltz model, along with led daytime running lights.
it could have been a good competitor for the 300/charger.
pm this is the best fwd impala yet, and as far as being reliable, efficient transportation, is the best impala ever.
other safety features include forward collision alert, lane departure warning, side blind zone alert, and rear cross traffic alert, which use either radar or cameras to detect various hazards and alert the driver.
whoever thinks this is ugly has no clue what they are talking about.
i think it looks nicer on the outside than the taurus, but comes short of the azera on the inside and out.
this thing will be just like the ecoboost exploder.
a little more "oomph" (30+hp and lots of torque) from the electric motor would be nice though in such a large car.
notalwaysbeengood - 04/04/12 09:06 am better looking than the last car by a country mile, but i find the side sculpting too busy, and the same with the interior.
i hope chevy comes out with an awd version, that would be pretty cool.
it looks like they glued doilies randomly all over it.
i think it is the best looking front wheel drive sedan under 40.
the new impala has some mighty big shoes to fill, and will very likely be the best fwd impala yet.
am this car will have the 2.5l and the e-assist system.
i don't love it, but it looks decent.
great lines, great details, great wheels.
this thing will be just like the ecoboost exploder.
i'm not a fan of the looks like it should have been on a 2nd gen. hhr rear quarter, but otherwise this is huge improvement styling wise over any post '72 impala.
this much improved interior and new found style should increase retail customer percentage.
for sure, it's nothing like the real impalas that were large, held six adults, v8s, coupes, and stylish from years ago, but for a family that needs 4 doors to cart people around, it should do ok.
this isnt being designed as a rental car first.
this car is great and its a huge step forward for the impala and its one step closer to greatness.
i hope it does'nt have the cave type of appearance of the lacrosse in person and that if in the drivers seat one has good visiblility all around.
on top of that, none of the three cars have the exact same powertrains choices.
at first i thought wow nice than i thought, again not the car i was hoping it would turn out to be not edgey enough.
im thinking a loaded ltz will be around $38k.
one of the previous impala’s biggest trouble spots was its low-rent interior.
a long greenhouse area accentuates the impala’s sleek profile, and finally comes to a point at the rear quarter window, which terminates right before the impala emblem on the rear panel.
and the price will likely move closer to $30k to start.
malibu uses the 2.4l only because the 2.5l was not yet ready, but next year all malibus will use the 2.5l, so why not the impala in 2013?
look at compeitors like the taurus and the passat.
pm this is the best fwd impala yet, and as far as being reliable, efficient transportation, is the best impala ever.
the steering wheel looks like the ones in some mercedes, two: it's not a rwd.
i just am disappointed in the rear again.
gm says the system’s appearance in the 2014 impala will mark its first use in a chevy model.
i liked it in pictures but in person it looked terrible.
audi, bmw, benz all higher class cars so they don't really compare...
i see this as being a huge sales success soon after hitting the market.
but this looks much more expensive than it will be.
and i can only assume they will offer an upcoming twin-turbo v6 when ready, the lesser one i assume would be enough.
the steering wheel in that car was gorgeous (imo).
i haven't heard of that being a widespread issue, but i would hope for better materials and build quality.
sccardriver - 04/04/12 11:23 am this car is a much larger car than the new malibu is.
pm great looking car from the outside.
i loved the rear lights on the 00-05 impala.
leaps and bounds better than the tired model its replacing though.
this new grill styling, along with the traverse, will be for the chevrolet “premium” models.
machinereplica - 04/04/12 03:41 am to anyone who says the early impalas of the 60's were anything more than all show and no go are ridiculous.
i know the new impala will have some major technological advancements inside and out -  i just hope it doesn't look too much like the camaro or the new bu... t2mgb18 - 04/02/12
again chevy is making the impala to compete and not dominate.
am wow!!, stunning car, i love the sharp crease at the rear.
i dont care how many current impalas are sold to rental agencies, this one looks good.
4 cylinder engines in large cars are not a good idea, not matter how stressed you make them.
gm is addressing that issue in the new model by employing high-quality fabrics, ultrasuede, and perforated leather inside the cabin of the 2014 impala.
feel as though its lost its sporty/athletic look in favor of a more premium look.

if this car falls in the league of toyota avalon & ford taurus, then the new 2013 ford taurus is tighter, cohesive and better looking car.
i'm not a fan of the looks like it should have been on a 2nd gen. hhr rear quarter, but otherwise this is huge improvement styling wise over any post '72 impala.
this doesnt offer awd and it offers the 2.5l. lacrosse doesnt offer the 2.5 and offers awd.
however, i would think the price will undercut the azera.
this is my second sub 14 second '68 full size chevrolet, the other being a 385 horsepower 427 bel air that was a couple of tenths slower (13.2) than the l79, but had it covered on the mph side of the time slip (110-112>105-108).

am @connermt the fusion, accord, camry, passat, and altima are not in the impala's class,they compete with the malibu.
nope, can't think of another non-gm car in this class that looks this good.
looks like a cheap korean ripoff of a toyota camry - the interior is more mishmash of design disasters from government motors - nothing works together - colors don't coordinate - textures are horrible - the exterior has a mishmash of dents, creases, and concepts.
04:44 am if 12.9 seconds through a quarter mile (the best time to date for my corvette 327 powered impala) doesn't qualify as fast, i'd hate to see what does.
i'm 34 and i wouldn't mind driving one.
machinereplica - 04/04/12 03:41 am to anyone who says the early impalas of the 60's were anything more than all show and no go are ridiculous.
major props to the design team both in and out.
i am impressed with the look of this car.
the steering wheel and back end are disappointing though considering how good looking the rest is.
the steering wheel is horrendous and the toupee on top of the guage cluster is rediculous.
fwd not a bother since itll be the wifes car..
i just dont think that moter will have the power to pull this car around, they might want to add a blower to that motor to make it relevent.
weird to keep the 2.4l around unless it's a tooling / cost saving issue to continue stamping out the inferior 2.4l. hopefully that's a mistake in the article or the 2.5l will be used later in the year or 2014 (2015 model).
fwd and sick, wheezy little engines tugging around 2 tons of flab.
this much improved interior and new found style should increase retail customer percentage.
this isn't mindless impala bashing - it is an honest assessment of a product that just doesn't work as it is offered.
their space, value and style is what people like- most folks could care less about rwd.
mustang fanboys probably don't like it bc it resembles the camaro.
@autobug: the current car is a fleet king because its old and outdated and affordable.
the 4-cylinder engines, especially with the power outputs currently sited, have no place in the automobile of this size and legendary status.
i believe the taurus, avalon, cc, and maxima compete with the impala.
it doesn't worry the chrysler twins (300 and charger) one bit.
a friend of mine actually has a gorgeous 65 impala.
with engineering choices not made by the bean-counters of old...but the political officers of the new regime.
and those four cylinder engines sound pathetic for a car of this size.
@autobug: the current car is a fleet king because its old and outdated and affordable.
this looks nothing like xts or lacrosse inside and out.
the impala rides on a macpherson-strut front suspension and four-link rear independent suspension, and has its front cradle isolated from the rest of the car by way of a hydraulic ride bushing.
toycrusher - 04/04/12 04:58 am first decent looking impala in years.

elgatofuego - 04/04/12 12:39 pm dang, it looks fantastic.
plus, gm's powertrain warranty matches chrysler's...better than ford or toyota.
i at least had hope...a front wheel drive impala only conveys to the suspense-held public what everyone feared; that absolutely nothing has changed.
through this touch screen, drivers can interface with chevy’s available mylink system, which incorporates bluetooth hands-free phone and streaming audio, plus optional navigation.
this car is clearly full sized in terms of space.
i'm still not a fan of chevy tan and brown interiors and their tacky "ambient lighting" but i'd say that the avalon and azera has their work cut out for them.
they could have easily done something like a 65 impala rear tail lights.
but with the all-new 2014 chevrolet impala making its world debut at the 2012 new york auto show, the bow tie brand is promising to erase memories of the long-running nameplate’s largely forgettable outgoing model with a more refined interior, the latest in technology, and a vastly improved driving experience when it goes on sale in early 2013.
i can't help but notice how much it looks like the current azera though.. almost like they had the azera on hand when they were designing this car.
i think it looks nicer on the outside than the taurus, but comes short of the azera on the inside and out.

throttleblip - 04/04/12 11:28 am car looks great but the ugly steering wheel looks just like the terrible unit found in the current gen mercedes s-class.
am certainly some vw passat in that front end design.
i just read on another website that awd will not be offered on the impala.
35mpg is good though for such a large car.
am not a bad looking car inside and out, but mostly targeted at the rentals, and the ford taurus and avalons of the world.
i just saw a new malibu at the local chevy dealer.
i really thought that lutz would've been able to pull it off; the trimming down, and building up of a truly competitive american brand.
everything will hinge on materials and build quality.
nothing like a huge, undulating gap in body panels to scream quality.
as someone else stated these new grills for the impala and traverse seem to be for their upper class models however if you look at least on the impala it has two bars in the grill symbolizing the single bar found on chevys.
overall, minus the ugly steering wheel, an incredible design masterpiece easily erasing the current impala from my mind..heres to hoping for an awd ss model!!
ambient lighting is available.
xts has v6 only and offers awd.
it is an extremely nice car and sounds great with a huge lump of snarling iron under the hood, but it is by no means fast.
the curves and bulging fenders are a long way from the old slab-sided design language.
this looks way to much like a toyota.

i think it is a fantastic looking car, and compared to the old impala, this car is considerably better on looks alone.
i am really impressed with this car, and i'm sure it looks even better in person.
overall, minus the ugly steering wheel, an incredible design masterpiece easily erasing the current impala from my mind..heres to hoping for an awd ss model!!
the only thing i don't like is that steering wheel.
still, leaps and bounds better than the current car.
the current impala is built okay, but its interior on one of my relative's 2009 is already falling apart.
great combination for the road warriors that want good comfortable reliable transportation with some power.
the rest of the interior is well done though.
looks good, but there's no flare like the impala has.
am hope there is an impala supersport in the works to square off against the taurus sho, bring back the 5.3 ss version with awd
that said, i think for what this car is intended to be, it executes it quite well.
that being said, the styling of this car is just beautiful.
the v6s are what people buy anyway, not the hemi models.

wow, fantastic design along with the great reliability and handling of chevrolet makes one great car!
am @connermt the fusion, accord, camry, passat, and altima are not in the impala's class,they compete with the malibu.
the new impala adds 1.2 inches to its wheelbase, though overall dimensions don’t change much (0.9 inches longer, 0.1 inches wider, and 0.2 inches taller.)
since an ss would need the (developing) 3.6l twin-turbo, and awd to handle the power.
chevrolet needs to offer a turbo 4 cylinder with about 240 horsepower and more importantly, at least 250 lb-ft. with a goal of 35 mpg highway.

for it to truly be a rebirth of an icon it would have to be rwd, then it would be a truly amazing car, this however is a very good car for the price and the segment, it looks great but at the end of the day its all show and no go, where as the original impala did both amazingly.
unfortunately, we'll see a flood of these on the roads as soon as gm pumps budget & hertz rental fleets full of these.
in fact malibu's shouldn't have only 4 cylinders only either.
shaking that rental car image will take some time, but these changes could go a long way in earning the nameplate back some of its lost prestige.
the people who buy this car not only do not care if it is fwd, rwd, or awd, they likely do not know the difference.

the ls, lt, and ltz trims carry over to the 2014 impala, which will be built at gm’s detroit-hamtramck and oshawa, ontario (canada), plants.

a nice thick, leather wrapped wheel with a simple three spoke design and tasteful metal accenting.
for sure, it's nothing like the real impalas that were large, held six adults, v8s, coupes, and stylish from years ago, but for a family that needs 4 doors to cart people around, it should do ok.
the general expects the 2.4-liter eassist model to be epa-rated at 35 mpg on the highway.

insulting this car because the current 7 year old car is a rental favorite is stupid.
this isn't a dig on the old impalas, i just think people are reaching a bit here and just remember the old impalas as better than they really were.

the only models that had any kind of acceleration were the ss models and even then they weren't really speed demons.
i dont understand why people think that rwd is the main reason for the success of the chrysler lx cars.
variaban - 04/04/12 08:06 am looks much better than the model it replaces.
i really like it with the blue color.
the rear door just looks terrible.
the steering wheel looks like the ones in some mercedes, two: it's not a rwd.
the steering wheel and back end are disappointing though considering how good looking the rest is.
this car is great and its a huge step forward for the impala and its one step closer to greatness.
next-gen impala gets serious about style, amenities new car buyer's guide all our car data at your fingertips.
the interior looks great and the front end is ok but the rear door just looks awful.
this isnt being designed as a rental car first.
i believe styling is behind 2013 malibu just like taurus is behind 2013 fusion.
the exterior is attractive, the interior offers more than any of its competitors, and that is all it will take to attract buyers.
that being said, the styling of this car is just beautiful.
wow, fantastic design along with the great reliability and handling of chevrolet makes one great car!
syj - 04/04/12 12:23 pm reading through the comments you can see who is being realistic and honest and who is offering mindless impala bashing.
i do however wonder what the advantage of eassist is when the normal 4-banger will produce more hp and similar fuel economy numbers in the real world.
this looks nothing like xts or lacrosse inside and out.
variaban - 04/04/12 08:06 am looks much better than the model it replaces.
pm great looking car from the outside.
it doesn't worry the chrysler twins (300 and charger) one bit.
it would be huge for gm to offer this in awd.
the new impala has some mighty big shoes to fill, and will very likely be the best fwd impala yet.
@toycrusher: the current car is barely full sized.
in fact malibu's shouldn't have only 4 cylinders only either.
at least this impala would easily fit in the garage unlike the old ones.
either way the impala looks good, the interior in the 9th generation was horrible, the 8th gen was better.
cp_09malibuv6 - 04/04/12 07:15 am i like how this design wont overshadow the handsome new malibu, the way the new malibu makes the cruze look cheaper by comparison.
am a decent efforts that reminds me of a cross between a camaro and charger that got dialed back a bit.
the new acadia has a steering wheel from 1990, as does the traverse, escalade etc.
i see a really ugly honda not a chevy... mixed news with this one, needs an ss model and all wheel drive to battle the ford sho.
i am really impressed with this car, and i'm sure it looks even better in person.
insulting this car because the current 7 year old car is a rental favorite is stupid.
am i can't wait for the 2014 chevrolet impala, this should be a fantastic car.
as someone else stated these new grills for the impala and traverse seem to be for their upper class models however if you look at least on the impala it has two bars in the grill symbolizing the single bar found on chevys.
what's really impressive about '65 to '70 full size chevrolets isn't their impressive acceleration capability when equipped with upper tier v8's (325 horsepower and up), but their modern road manners, especially when equipped with the optional after '67 front disc brakes and accompanying 15 inch wheels.
this car is going to be much more expensive with all the bells and whistles and its brand new.
for it to truly be a rebirth of an icon it would have to be rwd, then it would be a truly amazing car, this however is a very good car for the price and the segment, it looks great but at the end of the day its all show and no go, where as the original impala did both amazingly.
the current impala is built okay, but its interior on one of my relative's 2009 is already falling apart.
impala's shouldn't have 4 cylinders,  it just is too small for a car that size.
the efforts by manufacturers to compensate for the idiotic cafe regulations by the obozo administration have been tried before....with disastrous results.
audi, bmw, benz all higher class cars so they don't really compare... nope, can't think of another non-gm car in this class that looks this good.
nonetheless, they'll sell a ton of these to police departments, rental car companies, and gm fans.
unless its rear drive, itll never perform like those two.
throttleblip - 04/04/12 11:28 am car looks great but the ugly steering wheel looks just like the terrible unit found in the current gen mercedes s-class.
if this car falls in the league of toyota avalon & ford taurus, then the new 2013 ford taurus is tighter, cohesive and better looking car.
gm could have done a better job on the dash pad, it appears to be an afterthought.
the only thing i don't like is that steering wheel.
the only thing i don't like is the steering wheel, which has always been a problem for gm.
this doesnt offer awd and it offers the 2.5l. lacrosse doesnt offer the 2.5 and offers awd.
anyways, i hope they do not do that to the impala... seano0 - 04/01/12 07:50 pm
one of the things that made impala a legend was it's strong engine, and if this car will only provide moderate performance it will also be considered a dud in the future (like the current generation impala).
am and please tell me why this is not a direct competitor with the malibu.
weird to keep the 2.4l around unless it's a tooling / cost saving issue to continue stamping out the inferior 2.4l.  hopefully that's a mistake in the article or the 2.5l will be used later in the year or 2014 (2015 model).
lay off the sauce name one car in this segment that has a more masculine front end.
looks pretty sharp, and that interior seems pretty fantastic.
pm think it has been improved and agree some of the design is busy.
seems like to me that gm is trying to protect the sales of the more expensive models based on this platform - the buick lacrosse and cadillac xts.
everything will hinge on materials and build quality.
, stunning car, i love the sharp crease at the rear.
i don't love it, but it looks decent.
(http://image.automotive.com/f/2008_saturn_vue/2308203520936955304+w500/steering-wheel.jpg) other than, i think this car will perform well in the sales department.
well, hertz, avis and budget just soiled their skivvies.
i really cannot believe it look this good.
a friend of mine actually has a gorgeous 65 impala.
the 4-cylinder engines, especially with the power outputs currently sited, have no place in the automobile of this size and legendary status.
i sure hope that picture is wrong that’s a pretty sad impala.
i see a really ugly honda not a chevy... mixed news with this one, needs an ss model and all wheel drive to battle the ford sho.
i think gm has created another huge improvement in its line up.
i like chevy's, but i don't like this car.
one of the things that made impala a legend was it's strong engine, and if this car will only provide moderate performance it will also be considered a dud in the future (like the current generation impala).
a central 4.2-inch color display within the wraparound instrument cluster relays the driver information, while an 8-inch touch screen with a hidden storage compartment behind it adorns the center stack.

i sure hope that picture is wrong that’s a pretty sad impala.
this isn't a dig on the old impalas, i just think people are reaching a bit here and just remember the old impalas as better than they really were.
i think anybody still hoping/praying for rwd on this car is kidding themselves.
i really wanted to like the impala, mainly because of the late 80's, early 90's ones (exc. 91-93)

click to view gallery gm says the new impala’s stronger structure enhances the quietness of the full-size sedan’s passenger compartment, and improves the handling and ride.
lasvegascolonel - 04/04/12 12:35 pm having lived through the great impalas that were large cars, v8s, stylish, coupes, and breathtaking in many ways, i wouldn't normally praise these kid hauler impalas (sedans), but this is nicely styled and i would consider this over a more bland camry or accord.
the only thing i don't like is the steering wheel, which has always been a problem for gm.
the cafe regs are making cars lame again like they did in the late 1970's.
the door panels and dashboard get soft-touch materials, while the seats are meant to look more premium than the old model with higher-quality stitching.
unless its rear drive, itll never perform like those two.
sccardriver - 04/04/12 11:23 am this car is a much larger car than the new malibu is.
