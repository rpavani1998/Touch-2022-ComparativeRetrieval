“almost all automanufacturers in the past have dropped different brand names and have changed the name of their cars for certain reasons and there is nothing wrong with this being done” correct, except for the fact that competently run companies drop brands that are losing money (as saturn, saab and hummer did for every year of their existence under gm control) , not making it (as oldsmobile and pontiac did for every year of their 106 and 83 year long existences).

i say this from experience because i work for honda and they unfortunately rebadged the rodeo as a passport.
again it is gm, the product would take a decade to be released and the us probably wouldn’t get it anyway!!!
i would have driven it off the lot instead.
the only thing left is the evo.
would it not be great to have a real full-size semi-luxo coupe to cruise around in?
350/350hp with 28 hw mpg!
honda s2000 white with red interior!
i do totally miss all that is pontiac….
the earlier ones were supercharged, then they were refreshed with a 260hp(i think) turbo powerplant.
ah, the unmistakable exhaust sound of the gm 3.1l v6.
(i have a my 2000 with almost 100k miles on it, and there’s just no reason to get rid of it) discontinued due to being a 10 year old chassis, but honda dropped the ball by not replacing it.
other forum members listed the buick gnx, fiero gt, last-generation acura tl, 1970 chevelle ss 454 ls6,pontiac g8 gt, 1993-1998 toyota supra, gmc syclone, and 1961lincoln continental, as the cars they would buy if they were still in production.

i remember getting on to the freeway in seceond about to shift to 3rd when i heard the rumble of the niebhor hood 91 5.0 (sick ass mustang) so i held 2nd to about 8000rpm and never saw the mustang only in my mirrior!!!

pontiac g8 and saturn aura – both solid built and were the reasons why gm could have made them work.

from the attention to detail, to the futuristic system monitor and trip computer, through the mechanical presets and volvo-esque hollow head restraints, and finally the tire smoking 5 speed stick, this silver 2-door 86 escort gt will always be the car that got me into cars, taught me how to use three pedals before i even much noticed so many cars had two, and served as a reminder during the 90s that american car companies certainly were capable of making a desirable small car.
its an opinion for a reason.
sorry but the shrink and the couch is in the next room….
the ws6 cars were amazing, i had two of them…never should have sold them same here (’98 and ’89), and while i miss the performance, i don’t miss the leaking a$$
69- what a nice looking car that doesn’t get all that much attn.
it was initially only suposed to be a very limited run, but its initial success led honda to keep building them.

i would probably get a ford edsel.
or lamborghini murcielago.
scenicoupe, 1961 cadillac coupe deville or eldorado cvt.
ha, one of the worst cars ever made!
most likely an old zagato.
i missed the part where mustangs and f-150s went out of production… we all can see how much you like them though… you mean you missed the years i listed?

the pontiac grand am.
anyone who cares enough about the automotive world to get involved with a thread like this should lament both the initial sale of saab to gm, then it’s ignorance in treating the brand like everything else it owned, and then finally trying to both offload it and still control who it goes to to avoid giving up its intellectual property.

written by: jason udy [g+]  on april 16  2012 5:00 pm many automotive models have come and gone, but sometimes a certain car  becomes so iconic, its successor can’t live up to the high standard  — or the memorable car is discontinued altogether.
stop throwing hissy fits.
what happened to mitsubishi?
the more time i get to spend with my cars the more i enjoy them, and that is learning my way around under the hood and on the road.
way ahead of its time.
for that matter compact trucks in general, so sick of the bigger is better bullshit.
the best cars ever made.
from an era when “utility vehicles” were for men, and styled as such.
thread of the day: what’s the most feminine car on sale today?
gm is giving them away because it wasnt even there money in the first place and since obama had his hands involved in it, im sure lots of people want him to fail.
especially if it had the new v6 and 8 speed tranny.
any of those pink cars that say “mary kay cosmetics sales rep of the year” anything with chrome bumpers.
those cars gave olds a reason to stay around even though the rest of the line up in that era just didn’t make sense.
thread of the day: what are the top cars you never want to see on u.s.  roads?
you went 165 in a car with like 200 hp and a 140 mph speedometer.
i will say that nothing sounds like these old engines, but they just are more trouble then they’re worth for me.
first or second generation miata (bonus points for the mazdaspeed miata).
i used to spank anything that wasnt a acura type r!!
(partial to those years since they had the 3rd brake light… i know, i’m wierd), a cadillac cimarron, any year, a ford exp/mercury ln-7, and probably a few others.
chrysler new yorkers, specifically 1990′s.
the last good toyota.
you just criticized someone else’s first generation rx7.
very nice styling in it’s day, especially if you got an upgraded model.
we all realize the firebird can’t ever make a return so sad….. the 70-74 i thought they were sinister.
i also like crappy cars from the ’80′s that nobody liked then or now, so i’d take a clean, original, low-mileage ’86-’87
integra gsr, toyota mr2 i would buy the sky redline.
i know not impressive
ford probe/mazda 626 turbo hatchback i would like the same general styling and modern 4 cylinder turbo engines with 6+ speed dual clutch transmissions.
to be honest the only cars that would sell today are hard core supercars of the day.
when the firebird was first introduced in the late 60s they outran the camaro!!
ford is not the best, but they turn out the biggest profit out of the relavent car companys, which means people want to buy them for what ford is asking for, and thats not cheap.
1995-1997 geo metro hatchback lsi guys, the honda nsx-r. any amc car.
by the time it came to start planning a clean-sheet redesign it was 2008, the economy had tanked, gas prices were high (for the us) and only a few thousand s2000′s were being sold globally.

i’m glad i had that memory to hold onto while scoffing at the automotive excrement that dropped into dealerships for 15 years until so recently.
go back to school or diaf.
de-contented it and wrecked what they had and although i totally loved the rx7 twin turbo reliability would atop me from putting it here as well as the sc400 however way too many dash light issues that cost us money also stops that.
let’s see… porsche boxster spyder land rover defender original audi quattro aston db4 gt zagato ford gt40 alfa romeo 33 stradale ferrari 250 testa rossa porsche 904 gts jag xke coupe auto union type c to name a few… forgot to list the mercedes sl300 gullwing, adding that to the list above.
huge and flamboyant by today’s (dull) standards, but a perfect antidote to all the “taller than they are long” clown cars out there now.
seemed so futuristic.

very arrogant to assume that manufacturers the world over want to get their hands on cutting edge gm technology, and would rather buy a worthwhile brand for millions of dollars than stroll into a gm dealer and just buy one or two cars to disassemble.

reliable as hell and 35+mpg.
oldsmobiles 60-77 – again they were at the top of there game when the gm divisions were seperately ran.
i highly doubt that acura holds the trophy for best car ever engineered i had 1 for a weekend back in the day, i took it up to 165mph on the highway!!
mitsubishi 3000gt haha chevy el camino, these were just plain cool and had something small trucks just don’t have… a v-8 and some sense of rebelliousness s2000 – hands down!
nothing in the potential sale could have given a buyer what they couldn’t have found out for themselves- or already knew.

motor trend forum member 400calvin says his  favorite car built was the second-generationhonda crx si.
68′ chevelle- one mean looking car.
and that the car can still get me someplace in an emergency.
it had a/c, a trip computer, a system function test with little lightbulbs on a graphic that could tell you if any light was burned out, 15″ aluminum wheels, a 5 speed stick, and some of the coolest seats and trim i’ve seen.
very different and destined to be a collecters item i would add the studebaker avanti supercharge nice pick; great car suprised nobody has mentioned the mitsu 300gt vr-4, or dodge stealth.
the sheer stupidity and utter incompetence of gm’s executives is shown by the fact that in both 2004 (when oldsmobile got the ax ) and 2009 (when they did in the proud indian), the division they were killing had never lost money, while the three divisions they kept (saab, saturn and hummer) had never made money under gm management.
enough room in the bed for all my tools and more horsepower than i could ever need.
for me, definitely the porsche 959 way back from 1985
they were both iconic cars that were far beyond their time.
became quite a hot little car
203 comments this is what id spend my money on if avaliable today: 1.crx si (new one with turbo and no damb hybrid/ev bullshit) 2.prelude si (must be turbo
owned one, nothing like a car you can (or have to), press the pedal all the way down every time you drive it…not the coolest, but reminds you how far you’ve come.

i would buy a pontiac g8 in a heartbeat.
just because hes obama.
mitsubishi eclipse awd gsx (2900lbs max)
86-93 mercedes 300e but my choice would be either the 91 to 93 or the 500e with porsche help.
so which car would you buy if it were still in production?
theres alot i would love to see but my number one is a toyota supra twin turbo… that car is my heart ^^^ this.
they let production run until updated government safety measurements meant honda had to put development dollars into the car, and the plug was pulled.
i thought the ws6 was so cool when it first came out, i stil think its awesome.

alfa romeo brera v6, the only way to petrolhead heaven.
when i was a little boy i dreamed of having any 60′s eldorado-toronado-riviera or a lincoln mark iii or mark iv.
if i could change only the engine to anything i wanted and keep everything else the same, it would be.. 86 buick gnx (fit in ford’s 3.5l ecoboost)
or a lamborghini diablo gtr.
still looks modern today, despite being over 10 years old now.

vw clearly won the worldwide sales race, hands down.
and a ft86 nissan 300zx pontiac g8 pontiac solstice chevrolet chevelle gmc syclone pontiac g8 gxp comes to mind, but so does a subaru baja turbo with a stick.
nobody ask for your not only stupid ass comment but incorrect either, and brand dropping is what happens when you go bankrupt.

ok here’s my two cents, which may make less sense.
turbo (sw22), toyota celica gt-4 (st185) or any celica from the 1st generation with at least a 2.0l and manual transmission, 1st or 2nd generation skyline gt-r, toyota 2000gt, any nissan/datsun fairlady zebra, toyota supra turbo mark iv, 2006 acura rsx type-s, porsche 930, bmw m3 e46 csl, pontiac g8 gxp…and there’s plenty more that i can’t think of at the moment.
i like so many icons already mentined, but i don’t like their old engines, because they are weak, and many have carboraters, and i’m not wasting my time with those.
