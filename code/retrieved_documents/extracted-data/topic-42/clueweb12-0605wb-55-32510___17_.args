they are inefficient and more prone to serious accidents.volvos do tend to be reliable, but they're not particularly fuel-efficient and any car from 10 or more years ago is going to emit significantly more toxic air pollutants than even a conventional car from the last few years, and far more than most hybrids.it has high build quality, and will be the most comfortable way to move your family -- so much more practical than many of the suvs and pseudo suvs people choose to move people in.moreover, toyota's hybrids have proven to be extremely reliable according to consumer reports.water and crop shortages are not a system of the environment, they are caused by too many people needing that water and those crops.in order to achieve a net reduction in per-mile global warming emissions, (i.e. to offset the additional emissions from manufacturing and disposing of another vehicle) the new vehicle will have to get 10-20 percent better fuel economy than the old vehicle, assuming the vehicle will be driven in a typical way (i.e. that it will be used for its full useful life - usually around 170,000 miles).they also give people a false sense of security in driving in bad conditions -- they are, in fact, less controllable on dry and wet pavement.also they demand more consistent driver attention, a good thing in this era of distracted driver multi-tasking.also, older used cars--even volvos--have less effective safety features than those available in recent years, including improved crumple-zone engineering, side-curtain airbags, better seatbelts, and electronic stability control systems.if one uses that saved money to weatherize one's home and install a ground-source heat pump, one may well produce greater ecological benefits overall.the major labor cost of u.s.-produced vehicles comes from our exorbitant health care costs, not union wages - and even these health care costs only add up to $1000 or so per vehicle.initial quality looks good, and ford quality on the whole has been on par with honda and toyota in recent years according to consumer reports.i prefer them, they are more energy efficient, improve performance in all conditions and are simpler to repair.if we are all willing to pay a little more for stuff that lasts and that can be realistically maintained, we can shift the economics of production to a more sustainable model.they are roomy, relatively cheap to buy and maintain, and you can get parts and repairs anywhere.
