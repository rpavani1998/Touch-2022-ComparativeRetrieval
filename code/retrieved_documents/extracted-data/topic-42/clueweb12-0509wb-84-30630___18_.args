it looks better and it provides the same all around performance than the camry.the camrys, although from toyota which was started in japan, are providing jobs for americans and tax to the american government.all reliable evidence clearly points to the ford being a superior vehicle.fords are not solid, and according to consumer reports, they are not as highly ranked as the competition from toyota, honda, nissan, vw, subarau, and even mazda which they partly own.something that people like you don't do on a regular basis, and when something breaks it is automatically ford's fault or gm's fault that they didn't engineer a vehicle that you can just drive without even changing the oil.the fusion was middle-ground in acceleration, had the best mpg, and it qualifies for a tax credit(the fusion)notably, the pressure to meet these hybrid expectations is now so high that manufacturers will knowingly trade a little efficiency to deliver those experiential goods.and if you read consumer reports, which i don't believe you ever have, they have said countless times, that ford has shown the most improvement out of all the american companies and their quality is just as good as toyrota and honda.as mr. cherian points out, the primary benefit of a hybrid is its recapture of kinetic energy otherwise lost to braking.if the fusion performs like the epa says and possibly even better by the drivers at fueleconomy.gov, it will have set a new bar for mid-size hybrids.although the epa has come a long way in rehabilitating its reputation as a creditable source of mileage numbers, that newfound respectability could be suffering a hiccup with the all-new,2010 ford fusion hybrid.this car is definitely a winner, even if the sticker price is slightly higher than the toyota's the tax credit should bring it close or even lower than the toyota.its got better performance, better new technology, and better gas efficiency.most likely because it's cheaper, faster, more fuel efficient in real lifeyou should take off moderate to the speed limit and then go into electric this will charge your battery and give longer all electric driving and with good charge 47 mph is easy for a short distance.
