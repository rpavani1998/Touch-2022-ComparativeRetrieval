the hybrid technology reduced emissions by 22 percent to 216 g/mile co2 and improved fuel economy by 28 percent to 50.2 mpg.the flywheel system combined with idle-off technology is expected to give the hybrid about a 20 percent boost in fuel economy over the conventional version.idle-off technology and direct injection should help with fuel economy as well.the vehicle achieves a fuel economy of an estimated 60 mpg in mixed driving and an all-electric range of 31 miles.using a 5.7-liter hemi v8, the two-mode system will increase overall fuel economy by approximately 25 percent.unfortunately, a poorly performing tailpipe emissions-control system severely compromises the smog-forming emissions performance of the infiniti m hybrid, earning it an epa air pollution score of 6.the parallel hybrid hatchback achieves a fuel economy of an estimated 69 mpg and co2 emissions under 145 g/mile.the rc achieves a fuel economy of an estimated 52.3 mpg and co2 emissions of 175 g/mile.the small family car achieves a fuel economy of an estimated 69 mpg and emits 38 percent fewer co2 emissions than its non-hybrid counterpart.honda civic hybrid (5 seat compact) epa estimated combined mpg:  44 epa smog score (10=best):  9 honda hopes a shift to lithium ion batteries will allow their hybrid technology to improve overall fuel economy at a lower price, better enabling the civic hybrid to compete non only with other hybrids, but with conventional vehicles as well.the front wheel drive (fwd) version achieves a 28 percent reduction in global warming emissions compared with the conventional fwd escape.the front wheel drive (fwd) version achieves a 28 percent reduction in global warming emissions compared with the conventional fwd escape.the hypnos achieves an estimated fuel economy of 52.3 mpg and emissions of 193 g/mile co2.hybrid’s drivetrain stores the energy saved in regenerative braking periods in a flywheel system, which is capable of spinning up to 60,000 rpm and can house enough energy to deliver around 80 horsepower for up to seven seconds.the evos’ plug-in hybrid drivetrain — which promises a total range of 500 miles from a gasoline motor and lithium-ion batteries — would recognize driver behavior and calculate traffic patterns to a preset destination, adjusting engine dynamics to maximize fuel economy.
