the cruze is expected to be higher quality and better styled than the out-going cobalt and should get much better fuel mileage.civics are known for reliablility and good resale value.this makes it resemble a fully loaded competitor instead of a good value, meaning chevy would lose people interested in a more stripped, lower priced base model.the cruze will be larger than the cobalt, the toyota corolla, the honda civic and the ford focus, but gm says that it will get better gas mileage than all of its competitors, about 40 mpg out of the 1.4l four-cylinder family zero engine.people might scratch their heads at first but if gm markets this right and word gets out about not only its performance but improved quality then i think it’ll eventually fetch more money.while the cobalt, the cruze predecessor, is currently fetching substantially less that its competitors, the malibu is going for $4,200 more than the previous model and has been a big hit for gm.gm is banking on the cruze costing more than its competitors so the company can make up some of the revenue lost when the market abandoned trucks and suvs in favor of small cars.i know that civics are high in demand, and people pay close to msrp or even a marked up price for them, while most american cars sell for way under msrp and with some sort of rebate.if the cruze is on par with the japanese competition and gets 5mpg better, it would be worth a 10% premium($18,700) over the $17k civic/corolla.so they can update the engine for better economy, give it more options and that car is good to go.it will definitely be a winner, especially with the 1.4 liter turbo (40 mpg).basically, chevy has to cut their vehicle issue rate in half, or start separating from the older models that have the higher incident rates.make it have better quality, get better mpg, and keep the styling advantage (the civic is not well styled).but gm cannot keep the same vendors offering lower-grade interior materials.the cruze is bigger than civic/corolla, is good enough to command a decent price and gets 40mpg….its going to steal a lot of sales from the malibu.gm has a lot of lost ground to make up in consumer perception, especially with compact cars.
