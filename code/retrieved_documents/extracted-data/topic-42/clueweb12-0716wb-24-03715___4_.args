fitted with the optional 4.7-liter v8 engine, the dakota is a torquey powerhouse that takes top honors in payload capacity and offers up to a 7,000-pound tow rating; most midsize trucks tow around 4,700 pounds.but the tacoma's reputation as the best midsize pickup is genuinely earned on both performance and quality; it's a comfortable, stylish truck that doesn't shy from real work.light, maneuverable, fast, nimble, reliable, and great ground clearance.if pricing is paramount, the 4.3-liter v6 engine is as proven and reliable as the sunrise, but well down on power.a real workhorse — as suggested by its clean, bold styling — the ram is financially superior with its smaller 4.7-liter v8 engine,able to tow up to 11,300 pounds, the ecoboost v6 is a $1,750 premium over the nonturbocharged base v6, which is far less than what an equivalent diesel would have cost.impressive trim packages, advanced electronics and generally superior detailing are there to satisfy those who find quality is nearly always the best buy.nicely equipped with midlevel trim, a 4x2 driveline and the fuel-sipping, 3.7-liter 302-horsepower v6 engine, the xlt custom can tow 6,100 pounds and looks good doing it, with its chrome grille and tailpipe, 18-inch wheels and unique cloth trim.like theranger, the nissan is cheap to buy, easy on gas and handy to drive in town or through tight spots on the ranch, and it is a decent off-roader.but the ram's hidden secret is its coil-spring rear suspension, which gives it a supple ride and precise handling, and there's still enough truck muscle left for durability and rough duty.better power, more towing capabilities, and not to mention the tranny is virtually bulletproof.we're taking a bit of a gamble here, as this is ford's first in-house diesel, but its 400 horsepower and 800 lb-ft of torque carry the ultimate bragging rights, not to mention just about anything tied to its trailer hitch.there's a reason why toyota has the best truck reputation in the world, they're the toughest.it doesn't matter in the least what anyone buys to me,but be assurred the pricing is outrageous,and the economy is gone with new epa requirements which have a devastating effect on what little reliability ford might have had.i know most of you are too patriotic to agree with me, but if you look at the facts, toyota has made some of the best trucks ever.
