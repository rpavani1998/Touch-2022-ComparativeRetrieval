they were very capable, and gave the feeling of a full-size/safe vehicle in a much more compact/shorter length.“almost all automanufacturers in the past have dropped different brand names and have changed the name of their cars for certain reasons and there is nothing wrong with this being done” correct, except for the fact that competently run companies drop brands that are losing money (as saturn, saab and hummer did for every year of their existence under gm control) , not making it (as oldsmobile and pontiac did for every year of their 106 and 83 year long existences).the more time i get to spend with my cars the more i enjoy them, and that is learning my way around under the hood and on the road.ford is not the best, but they turn out the biggest profit out of the relavent car companys, which means people want to buy them for what ford is asking for, and thats not cheap.the sheer stupidity and utter incompetence of gm’s executives is shown by the fact that in both 2004 (when oldsmobile got the ax ) and 2009 (when they did in the proud indian), the division they were killing had never lost money, while the three divisions they kept (saab, saturn and hummer) had never made money under gm management.plus i’m sure with modern technology – weight saving materials and more efficient engines – they should be able to muster some better gashe thought its size, styling, and powertrain were the perfect blend of performance and style for him—especially in red and black with mag wheels and a sunroof.it had a/c, a trip computer, a system function test with little lightbulbs on a graphic that could tell you if any light was burned out, 15″ aluminum wheels, a 5 speed stick, and some of the coolest seats and trim i’ve seen.very arrogant to assume that manufacturers the world over want to get their hands on cutting edge gm technology, and would rather buy a worthwhile brand for millions of dollars than stroll into a gm dealer and just buy one or two cars to disassemble.i enjoy tinkering with cars, i just want to make sure i’m not spending all my time and money on it to do it.nice tight gaps in the body, solid sounding doors, clean interiors.from the attention to detail, to the futuristic system monitor and trip computer, through the mechanical presets and volvo-esque hollow head restraints, and finally the tire smoking 5 speed stick, this silver 2-door 86 escort gt will always be the car that got me into cars, taught me how to use three pedals before i even much noticed so many cars had two, and served as a reminder during the 90s that american car companies certainly were capable of making a desirable small car.what a great time to have a japanese import, they had great style and were so much fun to drive.anyone who cares enough about the automotive world to get involved with a thread like this should lament both the initial sale of saab to gm, then it’s ignorance in treating the brand like everything else it owned, and then finally trying to both offload it and still control who it goes to to avoid giving up its intellectual property.they let production run until updated government safety measurements meant honda had to put development dollars into the car, and the plug was pulled.
