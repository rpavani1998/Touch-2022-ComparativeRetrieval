toyota actually pays the american worker, instead of using cheap labor.the 5.7 is a much efficient and better designed engine with tech , compared to the domestics which use ohv designs..to many americans, that makes a difference, to some it doesn't, they feel good about giving their money to a foreign company.have we all forgotten  that  competition is to obtain a better product and introduce variety.. do we see everything as a us  vs  them(ie foreign) issue... despite  the fact  that  toyota employs many americans and   treats them better desperate people say and do , the expected.. finally, before ford redesigned the f 150,  it was notoriously a  failure in crash tests, the  old generation tundra might not have had the looks but it always scored better in crash tests.have we all forgotten that competition is to obtain a better product and introduce variety.. do we see everything as a us vs them(ie foreign) issue... despite the fact that toyota employs many americans and treats them better desperate people say and do , the expected.. finally, before ford redesigned the f 150, it was notoriously a failure in crash tests, the old generation tundra might not have had the looks but it always scored better in crash tests.my f-150 has a good ride, decent power (5.4), handles well despite feeling like a tank.they have idled the texas plant due to poor sales, but will re-start it when they get rid of excess inventory.dodge makes a 5.7 liter hemi, toyota makes a 5.7 liter that outperforms it and gets better gas mileage..it adds nothing and takes away from functionality.i just want to agree with the guy on the previous page, the one who said that the toyotas just cant stand up to the day to day hauling and work that a truck needs to.i believe we are in debt as a nation about 9 1/2 trillion dollars right now, most of it owed to japan and china, so keep sending them money and hurting american companies if it makes you feel good.a yamaha is a good engine, but so is a mercury and they are an american company.im an american truck buyer, not because i am "loyal to the american bussiness" but becasue they make a product that will last for the long haul, not some vanity truck, that "rides nice" and "looks pretty on the inside" thats girl talk american trucks can stand up to any truck built anywhere.other then the truck being powerful and quick, the chassis/fit and finish/quality aren't on par with other trucks.the titan had an engine/transmission combination that put a lot of power to the pavement, and while the ride was a bit harsh it, again, did what was expected of it.
