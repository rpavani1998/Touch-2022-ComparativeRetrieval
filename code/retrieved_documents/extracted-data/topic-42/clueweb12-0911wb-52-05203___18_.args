it would give better overall handling and a better appearance.my wife's 4runner offers what no other manufacturer can provide; rugged good looks, sterling quality and dependability and fantastic resale.the point being, that with very little effort toyota could produce a 2012 or 2013 vastly improved diesel fj that could run in the 25 city/35 hwy mpg range and offer an improved torque range, over the current version, to the outdoors enthusiasts with realistic and substantial every day fuel savings.awd diesel fj would be way more popular than a standard 4 wheel drive model, the not getting stuck because the 4 wheel drive (2 drive tires) can't get traction, would be a wonderful advantage.i think the latest version of the d4d diesel motor meets the euro 5 emission standards and produces 190 hp with 420 nm torque.the new particulate filter system (updated 2011 version) works wonderfully on the 2011 toyota land cruiser.if you could make your product cost less than your competitors, while still offering more standardized features, like these noted above, that would also create momentum in the market in your favor.my personal experience has always been that toyota vehicles are built better and last longer than comparable domestics.this would work so wonderfully for a new 2012 diesel fj and improve the fj's performance and popularity over night.i have done some research and found that toyota makes a really efficient clean burning diesel engine for thailand and europe.also lifting the body such that the front (3 inches) and rear (2 inches) so the vehicle is level, would be good.if toyota wanted to improve the size of the suv market they have here in the usa, just these few changes would do that.or at least incorporating a seat that gives better protection to the driver on ruff roads.the fj 6mt transmission is desirable due to the full time or all wheel drive (awd) feature.why can't toyota be the first to do the usa a solid, and provide a 2012/2013 diesel fj that gets 25 city/35 hwy mpg for the outdoors man.
