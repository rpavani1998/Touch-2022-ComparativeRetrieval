toyota prius 2013 toyota prius: all-new for 2010, the prius probably won't get any major upgrades until its midcycle refresh arrives in 2012.
offering a diesel fj for the same price as the gas motor fj, would also be very cool.
all those get a more clever space efficient interior design .

second, issue is the transmission/transfer case set-up.
also bring the lc 76' series just like the one's in australia.
good mileage and in unstoppable awd in 3 gear ranges.

i think the latest version of the d4d diesel motor meets the euro 5 emission standards and produces 190 hp with 420 nm torque.
if your still uncertain, you could offer it as a special order and see what the demand is.
seems toyota did offer an automatic awd with a high and low range in the new 2011 toyota land cruiser.
last redesigned for the 2008 model year, the land cruiser typically stretches its lifecycle updates out over a longer period than most toyota models.
the only choice in north american market is the poor designed matrix .report
have the d4-d's available here such as the 1kd-ftv, 2kd-ftv, and the mighty 1vd-ftv for the land cruiser 200 series.
it sasalaska says: 08:44 pm, 05/24/2011 hi there toyota corporate, i'm very interested in your 2012 fj cruiser.
why can't toyota be the first to do the usa a solid, and provide a 2012/2013 diesel fj that gets 25 city/35 hwy mpg for the outdoors man.
123q. fourth, is the driver and passenger front seats.
2013 toyota prius-c: the prius-c is a compact version of the prius that's closer in size to the company's yaris hatchback.
the sales volume of this high mpg truck would be off the charts.
the reference for that engine is a d4-d, 1kd-ftv, it is a 3.0 (turbo charged 2982 cc) offered in the new 60 year anniversary model 2011 land cruiser, only being marketed in europe.
especially for the lumbar support, and having a height adjustment would be excellent.
my 2002 toyota tacoma has 398,000 km on it and it has been the best vehicle i have ever owned.
the reference for that engine is a d4-d, 1kd-ftv, it is a 3.0 (turbo charged 2982 cc) offered in the new 60 year anniversary model 2011 land cruiser, only being marketed in europe.
rumor has it that it will adopt some of the sleeker lexus design lines but will retain the 3.5-liter v6 as the powerplant.
make it tough,125,000 mile warranty and oh don't forget to listen to your customers and "consumer reports" who for years have told you that you need to bring in a design consulting firm to help you design some good comfortable seats with plenty of adjustments !
i would be the first one to buy a lc 76' wagon gxl, 1vd-ftv, front & rear solid axles, manual front locking hubs, manual transmission, v8 twin-turbo diesel.
i envy what comes to australia and not here (yes go to toyota australia's website and look up the specs on the lc 76', no other suv will come close and ridgid to that).

first, as your aware gas prices are climbing ($4.00+) and will probably will keep going up.
i've had great luck with honda and nissan as well.
diesel fj's out in the bright red color or bright emerald green.
also don't forget the prado for the complete line up of real diesel ridgid body-on-frame construction suv's.
the carvery blue was fair.
all those get a more clever space efficient interior design .
outdoor folks tow boats, snow machines, campers, trailers and other items.
first, as your aware gas prices are climbing ($4.00+) and will probably will keep going up.
awd in an automatic transmission fj diesel that gets 25/35mpg would make me go buy one today.
(look at the 2011 vw tdi jetta for ideas (if necessary), they did a good job and have a interesting height adjustment system.)
illoxyill says: 11:43 pm, 04/15/2011 this would be the only toyota i would buy.
if ford can do it on their f150 4x4's i know toyota can do it too.
also bring the lc 76' series just like the one's in australia.
also the cold weather plugin for the oil pan/water heater and tow package with the square hitch having both a circle plug (electric brake with a brake controller system integrated into the fj dash) and the std square plug should both be on the vehicle and be included as standard equipment.
i would be the first one to buy a lc 76' wagon gxl, 1vd-ftv, front & rear solid axles, manual front locking hubs, manual transmission, v8 twin-turbo diesel.
and i have long legs, so i find the seats in the fj's to be a disappointment and extremely uncomfortable.
my wife's 4runner offers what no other manufacturer can provide; rugged good looks, sterling quality and dependability and fantastic resale.
if you wanted to bump-up performance you could easily do it by adding a 3" exhaust system to the d4-d diesel and t-week your chip controlled fuel/air chip settings.
also lifting the body such that the front (3 inches) and rear (2 inches) so the vehicle is level, would be good.
the hilux i saw on the australian site looks like someone married a venza front end with a subaru brat rear, no thanks.
the voodoo blue ones always catch my eye and primarily drew my interest to the fj design.
it would give better overall handling and a better appearance.
the setup i would pick is the 18 inch toyota fj cruiser trail teams special edition black kmc xd series rockstar rims, and the bfgoodrich mud-terrain t/a km 2 tires size 37x12.50r18( 939x317, 37.0x12.5 )
especially for the lumbar support, and having a height adjustment would be excellent.
the orange cone yellow sucked.
the point being, that with very little effort toyota could produce a 2012 or 2013 vastly improved diesel fj that could run in the 25 city/35 hwy mpg range and offer an improved torque range, over the current version, to the outdoors enthusiasts with realistic and substantial every day fuel savings.
toyota tundra 2013 toyota tundra: after a mild refresh for the 2010 model year, the tundra pickup isn't likely to see any major upgrades until the 2013 model year at the earliest.
third, i think changing the tires and wheels would help with the ground clearance problem.
awd in an automatic transmission fj diesel that gets 25/35mpg would make me go buy one today.
it may be in vogue right now to talk up ford, but when i compare my ford experiences with toyota experiences, toyota comes out on top.
why can't toyota be the first to do the usa a solid, and provide a 2012/2013 diesel fj that gets 25 city/35 hwy mpg for the outdoors man.
i also would love a turbo diesel option for better mileage.
burns no oil, runs like new.
anyone hear the real story on when the redesign is going to happen?report itreport it fandiesel says: 05:52 am, 01/03/2012 hi toyota, you and all other brands in this country are not bringing a turbo diesel (small or midsize) out !
if it had a standard high range (h), a low range (l) and a extra-low (ll) range setting, it would be so excellent!
my thoughts are that the american and australian markets would suck them up like a hoover vacuum.
overall dull, drably colors on vehicles that cost 25-30k won't be very popular.
my personal experience has always been that toyota vehicles are built better and last longer than comparable domestics.
toyota couldn't keep up with the demand in either market.
the voodoo blue ones always catch my eye and primarily drew my interest to the fj design.

good mileage and in unstoppable awd in 3 gear ranges.
diesel fj's out in the bright red color or bright emerald green.
this would be a major selling point.
if you could make your product cost less than your competitors, while still offering more standardized features, like these noted above, that would also create momentum in the market in your favor.
the long bed makes it as functionual as a full size but i can still park it in the garage in the winter.
this would work so wonderfully for a new 2012 diesel fj and improve the fj's performance and popularity over night.
report itreport it truckluva23 says: 02:51 pm, 01/17/2011 would love to see a tacoma trd off road with a diesel here in the states.
bright yellow was good.

also the cold weather plugin for the oil pan/water heater and tow package with the square hitch having both a circle plug (electric brake with a brake controller system integrated into the fj dash) and the std square plug should both be on the vehicle and be included as standard equipment.
i will never again be duped into buying a ford.
keeping the voodoo blue available as a color choice on future fj's would be wonderful too.
the new particulate filter system (updated 2011 version) works wonderfully on the 2011 toyota land cruiser.
i get the desire for a smaller truck mated to a six speed.
brakes, tires, oil changes, a couple tune ups and one repair on the oxygen sensor on the exhaust (simple cheap fix) and that's it.
if your still uncertain, you could offer it as a special order and see what the demand is.
seems in the off road environment moving through bad terra-forma, crawling over rocks, or any 4 wheeling situation would be vastly improved if the awd system had 3 ranges to work with.
the orange cone yellow sucked.
this would be a major selling point.
they aren't very comfortable.
keeping the voodoo blue available as a color choice on future fj's would be wonderful too.
well since it's 2012 and there does not seem to be a full tacoma redesign rolling around, perhaps this info is a bit outdated.
it would give better overall handling and a better appearance.
the voodoo blue was very nice, eye catching.

the new colorado  with 2 duramax diesel options most likely will  not be setup  here  with diesel and the vw amarok tdi is not coming in, so as "nike" would say, just do it !!
or at least incorporating a seat that gives better protection to the driver on ruff roads.
the sales volume of this high mpg truck would be off the charts.
toyota there is a demand for a torquey diesel motor with somewhere around 30 mpg +.report

i have done some research and found that toyota makes a really efficient clean burning diesel engine for thailand and europe.
awd diesel fj would be way more popular than a standard 4 wheel drive model, the not getting stuck because the 4 wheel drive (2 drive tires) can't get traction, would be a wonderful advantage.
the fj 6mt transmission is desirable due to the full time or all wheel drive (awd)

a full redesign for the 2010 model year means the 4runner isn't likely to get any significant updates until at least 2012.
we looked and shopped around at other dealers and the matrix was by far the best.
i also would love a turbo diesel option for better mileage.
given that the camry recently received new four-cylinder engine and six-speed transmissions, the 2012 model will likely focus on revised styling and an updated interior.
