other then the truck being powerful and quick, the chassis/fit and finish/quality aren't on par with other trucks.
the front end was always way too soft for my liking, especially with 500 lbs or more in the back..
now i would admit, the older tundras (previous generation) are well built all round but the new tundras are just plain terrible compared to the older ones, not to mention

maybe they don`t have a leg to stand on because they lost it in pearl harbor, either way, i`m going to run my tundra into the ground.
it adds nothing and takes away from functionality.
i just prefer doing business with a company that is american.
im an american truck buyer, not because i am "loyal to the american bussiness" but becasue they make a product that will last for the long haul, not some vanity truck, that "rides nice" and "looks pretty on the inside" thats girl talk post reply new user | posts: 47 | joined: 08/08 posted: 09/30/08 08:04 am american trucks can stand up to any truck built anywhere.
have we all forgotten that competition is to obtain a better product and introduce variety.. do we see everything as a us vs them(ie foreign) issue... despite the fact that toyota employs many americans and treats them better desperate people say and do , the expected.. finally, before ford redesigned the f 150, it was notoriously a failure in crash tests, the old generation tundra might not have had the looks but it always scored better in crash tests.
the dealer said the tundra crew cab doesn't come with a bench in the front.
but when u say ur tundra is so fast, its because they put a higher geared transmission in it and it has speed yes, but it needs that larger engine to produce the same power as the smaller engined equivalents, therefore more gas, and an overworked engine.
my mileage in all of my trucks has ranged from 16 mpg to 20 mpg, depending on what i was doing on any given tank.
where as all full-size trucks are now on a fully boxed frame, the toyota still runs on a c-channel setup.
so the third passenger sits up in the middle.
the titan had an engine/transmission combination that put a lot of power to the pavement, and while the ride was a bit harsh it, again, did what was expected of it.
i want you to understand i do not think a toyota is a bad vehicle.
what do you expect ,in fact the sheer negetivity is really a sign of nervousness in some circles of its potential.

as far as i`m concerned, i would love a pearl harbor edition tundra, bullet holes n` all.
they will never build them in indiana again, they are taking out the line due to poor sales.
so i installed firestone ride rite airbags in the back before the truck was 2 years old.
this is our country, these are our trucks, gm, ford, dodge.
i also owned a t-100 way back in the day before the chevy.
they used to build tundras in indiana, not anymore, the texas tundra plant is shut down at this time.
keep sending your money to japan brother, they appreciate it.
doubt i will.. bottom line is: there is a lot of people who do not like the tundra, most of them don`t have a leg to stand on because they have never owned one or drove one for 200,000 trouble free miles.
but what gets me is the face that i need a bigger truck from the loads i carry but this little thing handles it just fine, then i see some *** in a big bad toyota tundra with a bed that he polishes every week (whoever polished their bed should throw thier truck away).
its not that toyota would knowingly put in a weak camshaft in..same with other things..
u talk like the usa can live like a island..
from the factory, the suspension was a little lacking i thought..
the pickup market in general is not good due to gas prices.
it`s not good for the skilled american craftsman that build it.
to many americans, that makes a difference, to some it doesn't, they feel good about giving their money to a foreign company.

besides the timing belt and water pump, the only other things that have needed to be fixed since my father bought it in `99 are the starter @145,000 and overdrive & torque converter @ 138,000.
all of her cars have been toyotas... and she drives them to the ground.

i just had the 3rd timing belt put in, along with a new water pump.
anyway, i just think that none of the trucks are junk and will all serve their purpose.
dodge makes a 5.7 liter hemi, toyota makes a 5.7 liter that outperforms it and gets better gas mileage..
fort wayne in, pontiac, mi, canada and mexico dodge builds pickups in fenton mo,warren mi and mexico.
the interior in my opinion is the ugliest thing out there, and the quality of the truck is just plain bad.
now i would admit, the older tundras (previous generation) are well built all round but the new tundras are just plain terrible compared to the older ones, not to mention i find the styling inside and out to be just plan ugly.
(the reason for only od & tq converter is my trans guy said the other 3 gears were “like new”).
a yamaha is a good engine, but so is a mercury and they are an american company.
i only own a little 1998 v-6 dakota, but with it ive hauled more pounds then 90% of toyota tundra owners ever will.
i want you to understand i do not think a toyota is a bad vehicle.
my personal preference of the three is the ford simply because it really is built to take a beating, not to drag race.
they build f series trucks in louisville, ky. norfork, va dearborn, mi, kansas city, mo. and mexico gm trucks are built in flint, mi.
the front end was always way too soft for my liking, especially with 500 lbs or more in the back..
this is our country, these are our trucks.
then you have the “real” americans that just have to “buy american” because buying an american car is good for america..

a center console in a truck is a complete waste of space.
i also owned a t-100 way back in the day before the chevy.
all three were great trucks, honestly.
thats why you bought your dodge that was made by skilled mexican workers.

i told the dealer i will take the boat, but i want a mercury motor on it.

most in my town who the truck have had their tail-gate fall off.
they have idled the texas plant due to poor sales, but will re-start it when they get rid of excess inventory.
it`s not good for the skilled american craftsman that build it.
so americans are paid to build them.
dodge makes a 5.7 liter hemi, toyota makes a 5.7 liter that outperforms it and gets better gas mileage..
i had no complaints with any of them.

materialman: they used to build tundras in indiana, not anymore, the texas tundra plant is shut down at this time.
and when i send it off to scrap, i`ll be right back at the toyota dealer buying another tundra.
then you have the “real” americans that just have to “buy american” because buying an american car is good for america..
honestly i think that for light duty any of the trucks in that class will not out right fail in their role.

also toyota trucks have umm..
toyota actually pays the american worker, instead of using cheap labor.
other then the truck being powerful and quick, the chassis/fit and finish/quality aren't on par with other trucks.
yea i just want to agree with the guy on the previous page, the one who said that the toyotas just cant stand up to the day to day hauling and work that a truck needs to.
better like the fact that they build toyotas in the usa unlike the big 3 who build their trucks in mexico and canada.
i believe we are in debt as a nation about 9 1/2 trillion dollars right now, most of it owed to japan and china, so keep sending them money and hurting american companies if it makes you feel good.
i drive a 2000 tundra sr5 4x2 v-8 with 189,000 miles on the clock.

myself, i will do business with companies that are american and keep the money i spend at home.
ford/gm/dodge have no where near as much problems as the truck.
and to the guy who says his tundra is faster then any other truck i say this, trucks are geared lower to be able to haul larger loads with smaller engines, (my dakota will accelerate the exact same with an air commpresser and tool box in the bed as it will empty, even though that acceleration is not that great)
if you go over bumps, you can watch the bed flex (which is probably the reason for the recall on the tail-lights since they were cracking).

many a time i had the bed full and and had to stick stuff in the back with the seats up.
and when i send it off to scrap, i`ll be right back at the toyota dealer buying another tundra.
thats why we export jobs , u think your  american corporations give a hoot that your a poor american begging that they give u a job...
it just makes no sence to have a truck with so mush power and not use half of it.
many a time i had the bed full and and had to stick stuff in the back with the seats up.
when i bought my chevy i had not been impressed with the dodge (did test drive one) but i hear the previous generation (to the current coming out) was quite good.
as far as owning/driving foreign vehicles... my wife is a toyota lover.
a  they  go where its to their advantage, u just  cant  stand  someone  benefiting...

don't run that bs on me son, i have been working trucks hard on a pipeline right of way for 30 years.

i don't know more power, more torque,and can tow more.
it couldn't even support the weight.
the pickup market in general is not good due to gas prices.

my mileage in all of my trucks has ranged from 16 mpg to 20 mpg, depending on what i was doing on any given tank.
i find the styling inside and out to be just plan ugly.
my f-150 has a good ride, decent power (5.4), handles well despite feeling like a tank.
because it has potential and is quite a success.

that`s the maintenance record so far, besides oil changes, 2 sets of spark plugs, numerous trans services (every 25,000), 4 sets of shocks, 1 set of sway bar links and poly bushings up front, 3 sets of rotors & pads, the drums & shoes are original.
