this is an instructional or logistical problem to solve for a planned online course on human computer interaction, and we are looking for examples of other courses that are doing something similar, or best practice guidance from this community.here is the problem: the course will be designed to have 5 or 6 small teams of students in a 25 student course who create physical, tangible products (interface prototypes) as a central part of the course and need to exchange them with the other student groups, as well as the instructor, 3 different times over the course for usability testing and feedback.search:digital humanities questions & answers Â» interfaces, design & usability tags: rickreo@gmail.com member this is an instructional or logistical problem to solve for a planned online course on human computer interaction, and we are looking for examples of other courses that are doing something similar, or best practice guidance from this community.this is a fully online course and costs are an issue but so is good pedagogy.so how to coordinate the production and sharing of a physical object among the group members who produce it (like in a bricks&mortar lab or studio), and then to produce multiple copies of each version of the prototype product to distribute to each student in other groups who could live anywhere on earth, and specially package them so that each group opens them the same way and proper way so as not to invalidate their experience of using it.virtual simulations are not preferred, b/c it is deemed too involved to teach 3d modeling for this course and b/c the projects need to be touched to be evaluated.this is also a constraint on the type of studio/lab they would need access to.if they are durable plastic, then maybe not such an issue.
