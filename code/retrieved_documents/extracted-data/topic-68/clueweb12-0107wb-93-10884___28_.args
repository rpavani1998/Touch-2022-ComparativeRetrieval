an online course curriculum that reflects the instructor's ability to stay current with research and developments in a particular discipline, perhaps in tandem with relevant interdisciplinary knowledge, will enhance learning by ensuring that students have the most current and relevant information.redesigning an online curriculum presents rich opportunities to integrate the latest thinking in given disciplines and to incorporate new methodologies for teaching and learning.a well-designed curriculum for online learning nurtures both student learning and student retention.updating online curriculums — whether through tweaks or paradigm shifts — offers a key way to increase learner retention and success.an online learning experience that adheres to legal principles will uphold the reputation of the university and protect the rights of students.in addition, curricular updates can introduce important new content, and may also introduce pedagogical enhancements that can improve the quality of e-learning.effective updating of course curriculums to support and engage learners will encourage their persistence in the course and ultimately in their program of study, promoting degree attainment.while learners base their decisions to continue in or drop out of a course on a range of reasons, only some of which instructors can influence, instructors do play an important role in helping learners, including adult students, acclimate to an online classroom.the scalability of some of these online experiences can help learning experiences feel more personal and intimate, particularly in larger sections of courses where direct one-on-one interaction with the instructor is rare.encouraging interrelationships between learners helps improve student retention and degree completion rates.because they work within a componentized environment, course designers have considerable flexibility in reworking the modular curriculum and can switch content in and out at will.the interrelationships between domain-field elements that affect a curriculum given the reality of ongoing, often significant change in domain fields, it is imperative that faculty members stay apprised of the discoveries in their particular areas of expertise — certainly in the general interest of building new knowledge, but also in revising the curriculum for an online course.here, instructors are valued not only for their support of learners but for their contributions of new learning through their own work, their collaborations with colleagues, and student research under their tutelage.instructors and course designers can enhance the online learner experience and make it more real and engaging through applications of rich, multimodal, multimedia, and full-sensory (visual and sound) immersive learning.project-based learning can encourage students to engage in unwieldy projects, either alone, in pairs, or as part of multidisciplinary teams.
