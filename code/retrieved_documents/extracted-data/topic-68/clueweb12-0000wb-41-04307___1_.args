in doing so, clinical education can be transformed into a collaborative and highly effective experience that will serve to elevate the role of the physical therapist in our health care system.interns would receive a modest stipend in exchange for receiving a high quality standardized training program delivered under the auspices of a credentialed graduate medical education system that adheres to rigorous accreditation and quality standards.we must disruptively innovate within clinical education to attract the best applicants into our profession, many of whom currently pursue careers in medicine instead.one could even envision a matching process whereby students are competitively matched to specific residency programs…the right student to the right clinical education experience at the right time, the results of which would further incentivize quality and standardization and create a win/win/win proposition for students, educational programs, clinical practices, and most importantly, the patients to whom we provide care.fundamentally, the potential transformation of physical therapy clinical education is dependent upon the ability of academic institutions and clinical practices to align themselves in a symbiotic relationship that delivers mutual benefit and value for all stakeholders.similar to the medical model, students should attend physical therapy academic programs for didactic learning experiences, graduate once that component is finished, sit for licensure, and immediately begin a formal internship/residency lasting a minimum of 1 year.even the most highly capable clinical faculty do not have the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience necessary for a comprehensive clinical education experience.as a result, our students tend to progress through a highly organized and systematic curricula during this phase, evidence by a detailed schedule and syllabus.as it currently stands, there is no compelling economic argument to pursue a career as a physical therapist because of the inability to achieve a return on investment that justifies the necessary debt burden of the average student.we diligently measure student performance through countless rigorous written and practical exams.if we are going to be a meaningful contributor to health care reform and more importantly, play a prominent role in the reform process, we must hurriedly wake up from our delusions of grandeur, embrace the fact that we have a deep chasm in clinical education that must be closed, and wholeheartedly distance ourselves from the status quo.for example, the short duration of the average clinical affiliation combined with the interns’ limited skill set mitigates their potential to become a productive, value added member of the staff.migrating the preponderance of clinical education to the post professional, post licensure setting would shorten the typical academic program by 1/3 (2 years rather than 3), trimming tuition accordingly.interns would train collaboratively in group settings rather than a far more narrow learning experience that occurs when you only have 1 clinical faculty member.clinical resources are inefficiently expended to help the interns learn the various systems, documentation standards, billing procedures, etc., only to have the student move on to their next clinical affiliation immediately after their useful assimilation into the practice.
