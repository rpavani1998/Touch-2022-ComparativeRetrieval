virtual simulations are not preferred, b/c it  is deemed too involved to teach 3d modeling for this course and b/c the  projects need to be touched to be evaluated.
but i am an instructional designer assisting him.
what is involved to imagine doing this in a way that doesn't involve fedex  delivery and the costs involved?

this is  also a constraint on the type of studio/lab they would need access to.
this is an instructional or logistical problem to solve for a planned  online course on human computer interaction, and we are looking for examples of  other courses that are doing something similar, or best practice guidance from  this community.
i'm beginning to think that for online learning exchanging physical  objects multiple times is too problematic/cumbersome, and that designing an  alternative learning experience is a better way to go?
this is also a constraint on the type of studio/lab they would need access to.
what  size would the objects be?
here is the problem: the course will be designed to have 5 or 6 small teams of students in a 25  student course who create physical, tangible products (interface prototypes) as  a central part of the course and need to exchange them with the other student  groups, as well as the instructor, 3 different times over the course for  usability testing and feedback.
if the  products are fragile and/or large, than distributing them becomes much more  difficult.
what  tools, space, support would they need to actually produce the products?

so how to coordinate the production and sharing of a physical object among the group members who produce it (like in a bricks&mortar lab or studio), and then to produce multiple copies of each version of the prototype product to distribute to each student in other groups who could live anywhere on earth, and specially package them so that each group opens them the same way and proper way so as not to invalidate their experience of using it.
what sort of materials would you and the students be prototyping with?
this is a fully online course and costs are an issue but so is good  pedagogy.

so my question really is two questions: an implicit pedagogical one and the explicit logistical one.

if they are durable plastic, then maybe not such an issue.

printing is not a real option yet either.

what are the constraints that material and size impose as you see them?
