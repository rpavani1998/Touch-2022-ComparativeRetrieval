other than altruism, it is curious how academic programs have been successful in affiliating with clinical practices at all.
fundamentally, the potential transformation of physical therapy clinical education is dependent upon the ability of academic institutions and clinical practices to align themselves in a symbiotic relationship that delivers mutual benefit and value for all stakeholders.
we diligently measure student performance through countless rigorous written and practical exams.
yet, in our typical peace gene like fashion, we oblige the “predatory” behaviors of academic programs who have duped us into believing that it is our professional duty to provide free clinical education for students while the academic program rakes in substantial tuition dollars during clinical affiliation semesters for which the academic program provides virtually no services!
for example, the short duration of the average clinical affiliation combined with the interns’ limited skill set mitigates their potential to become a productive, value added member of the staff.
what strikes me as most odd then is why we don’t appear to be bothered by the lack of a clinical education curriculum that you can "touch and feel".

as educators in entry-level academic programs, we sit in many a faculty meeting debating the pedagogical pros and cons of adding “abc” content, taking away “def” content, dedicating more time to topic “x”, less time to topic “y”, etc.
in summary, we can no longer justify clinical education being relegated to 2nd class citizen status, and surely such a low view is inadequate for the contemporary vision 2020 physical therapist.
unfortunately, the default strategy for clinical education hinges on a “hope and prayer” strategy in which we send our students out into widely disparate learning experiences with little to no connectivity between clinical sites or even to the academic program.
as always, it's a genuine privilege to be in the same room (whether face-to-face or virtually) with friends and colleagues who are members of the greatest profession on earth.
unfortunately, academic programs are in a negative incentive situation when it comes to such reform because students currently pay tuition to their academic institution while completing their clinical rotations, creating a veritable cash cow for the academic program, yet the academic program provides few services during this period.
in short, the indirect costs for clinical practices to provide clinical education under the current model are steep and bothersome.
finally, it’s an outrage that our graduates currently have debt that is completely out of proportion with their ability to recoup their investment.

migrating the preponderance of clinical education to the post professional, post licensure setting would shorten the typical academic program by 1/3 (2 years rather than 3), trimming tuition accordingly.
therefore, the dce inefficiently spends countless hours managing affiliation agreements with practices that take very few students in aggregate over time.
interns would train collaboratively in group settings rather than a far more narrow learning experience that occurs when you only have 1 clinical faculty member.
we then sit back and “hope and pray” that our students have a good experience.
as a result, our students tend to progress through a highly organized and systematic curricula during this phase, evidence by a detailed schedule and syllabus.
if you meet these 3 criteria, you will be inundated with requests from dces around the country to affiliate with their program.
most will answer somewhere between 250-500 contracts, yet the program is only able to assign 1 or 2 students each year per location in most cases.
in other words, we need to “crowd source” clinical education so that the full “universe” of knowledge is available to them, not an isolated slice.
by the way, if we are to achieve meaningful reform in clinical education, clinical faculty must have the same faculty status and privileges of full time core faculty, if not higher!
one could even envision a matching process whereby students are competitively matched to specific residency programs…the right student to the right clinical education experience at the right time, the results of which would further incentivize quality and standardization and create a win/win/win proposition for students, educational programs, clinical practices, and most importantly, the patients to whom we provide care.
for example, it’s no mystery to the student as to what books they need to buy, what time they need to be where for what class, and what content to review prior to each class.
in fact, i routinely advise students that when their dce calls them during their clinical affiliation to check in on how things are going, they should make the dce stay on the phone for at least 100 hours to even begin recouping the value of the investment of tuition dollars the students have poured into the program.

i unfortunately was unable to attend due to a last minute military deployment.
clinical resources are inefficiently expended to help the interns learn the various systems, documentation standards, billing procedures, etc., only to have the student move on to their next clinical affiliation immediately after their useful assimilation into the practice.
in fact, many of our curricular “experts” even get passionately defensive when making such arguments.
even the most highly capable clinical faculty do not have the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience necessary for a comprehensive clinical education experience.
as a result, the clinical education sites are rarely connected to each other in an organized way and frequently even remain at an arm's length from the academic program, tethered only by the clinical affiliation agreement.

similar to the medical model, students should attend physical therapy academic programs for didactic learning experiences, graduate once that component is finished, sit for licensure, and immediately begin a formal internship/residency lasting a minimum of 1 year.

second, you must have a heart rate and pulse.
even the most highly capable clinical faculty do not have the depth and breadth of knowledge and experience necessary for a comprehensive clinical education experience.
if we are going to be a meaningful contributor to health care reform and more importantly, play a prominent role in the reform process, we must hurriedly wake up from our delusions of grandeur, embrace the fact that we have a deep chasm in clinical education that must be closed, and wholeheartedly distance ourselves from the status quo.
as it currently stands, there is no compelling economic argument to pursue a career as a physical therapist because of the inability to achieve a return on investment that justifies the necessary debt burden of the average student.

you don’t have to be an iso 5000 certified quality engineer to understand that quality assurance across this many educational experiences is impossible.

many thanks to steve anderson and the graham meeting participants (and as i understand it, was record attendance and a terrific meeting) for allowing me to be there virtually via skype to deliver my talk.

« the new year and resolutions | main | the pain game » january 15, 2012 we can do better than a ‘hope and prayer’ strategy for clinical education in physical therapist academic programs below is the text from a talk i recently gave via skype at the pps graham session this weekend in charleston, sc.
we must disruptively innovate within clinical education to attract the best applicants into our profession, many of whom currently pursue careers in medicine instead.
complicating matters, there are only 3 prerequisites for qualifying as a clinical instructor in our current model.
for example, the short duration of the average clinical affiliation combined with the interns’ limited skill set mitigates their potential to become a productive, value added member of the staff.
what strikes me as most odd then is why we don’t appear to be bothered by the lack of a clinical education curriculum that you can "touch and feel".
first, you must have a pt license.
