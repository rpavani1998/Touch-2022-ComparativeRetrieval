virtual classrooms, video conferencing, and telepresence technologies can provide benefits not found in the face-to-face classroom with a greater return on investment.these platforms can support both rapid delivery and creation of high quality content, are usable by non-specialist end-users, and yet support high-interactivity, high-fidelity content if needed.we’ve known for some time that both mature and emerging synchronous learning tools can provide benefits that foster productivity and reduce the cost of training.in light of these challenges, the virtual classroom represents an ideal technology solution for modern high-impact learning organizations.they are a place for everyday collaboration and for continuous learning.they are a place for everyday collaboration and for continuous learning.learners can access learning content, assignments, news, alerts, social and collaborative learning activities, and integrated virtual classroom spaces.yet, as i’ve catalogued here today, many of today’s virtual classroom systems are now also helping to bridge the gap between self-paced e-learning and face-to-face ilt as well as provide powerful support for informal learning – be it social, on-demand, and embedded.learning leaders have to be concerned about keeping pace in a rapidly-changing business environment, navigating a swirl of challenges brought on by rapid innovation in technology, changes in workforce demographics, and a challenging economic environment.most corporate employees are quite familiar with what it means to take a course over time: to meet in regularly recurring sessions, to have one-on-ones with the teacher, to have ongoing assignments, and to engage with fellow students in discussions and in project work.and they provide an ideal, on-demand environment for employee collaboration.but, as we’ve noted in past case studies such the amazing work being done at westinghouse electric, the higher-ed model for distance learning is a remarkably effective strategy for blending social learning with formal learning in the corporate world.participants in the program engage in online discussions, case studies, virtual workshops, and action-learning projects; and can access additional resources such as e-learning courses, case studies, research studies, videos, articles and other tools – all within the virtual space.feedback from participants has been very positive and overall results have been high.captivate interactions – for demonstration, practice, and assessment – can be used in the virtual space, adding powerful depth to the learning experiences supported there.
