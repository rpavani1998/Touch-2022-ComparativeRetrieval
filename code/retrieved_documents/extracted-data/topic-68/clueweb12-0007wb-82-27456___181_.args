with an emphasis on interdisciplinary approaches, students will come to understand more fully a specific field or approach to the arts, to demonstrate the practical applications of this field of knowledge, to carry out appropriate research on limited subjects within the field, and to work in a collaborative atmosphere of creative expression.these work-based learning experiences promote the application of theoretical knowledge and research skills acquired in the classroom to a productive and supervised experiential work site outside the formal classroom environment.this course is designed to provide students with the opportunity to examine their life-space; to envision alternative possibilities in their personal and professional growth; and to foster the development of creative changes toward their future life-career.the course provides students with opportunities for self-expression and encourages effective oral and written communication skills.the competencies acquired provide students with a sound foundation for the primary care of athletes and recreational participants.contemporary literature will help students acquire an appreciation for good literature and the tools to help them understand and enjoy that literature more fully.upon completion of this course, a student should have a qualitative understanding of how many of the basic principles of physics, chemistry and mathematics are applied in meteorology; an ability to relate personal weather observations to data received from weather instruments and analyzed on standard weather charts; and a new set of general data analysis skills.the course is also intended to help students learn or review fundamental accounting concepts and principles, enable students to review financial statements from a user perspective, provide students with a means to investigate the underlying source documents that generate most accounting information, and offer students the chance to explore some managerial aspects of accounting by performing financial analyses and comparisons.students will examine central ideas in science, gain computer skills in processing scientific data, and examine the process for representing physical and living systems as mathematical models.students completing this course will possess the skills necessary to accurately perform routine quantitative analyses of samples, use a governmental standard methods, and to judge the precision and reliability of their results.a practicum in local schools, including observation and presentation of a series of lessons, will provide students an opportunity to apply principles and insights acquired through social studies.participants will come to understand that learning is an active, constructive process and will recognize that using a variety of learning strategies and development of critical thinking skills will enhance understanding.students will continue their active exploration of the interdisciplinary fine arts, as they collaborate in improvisational and formal arts productions, and continue to develop an understanding of the technologies and methodologies through which these arts are created and appreciated.students will examine central concepts in mathematics, gain computer skills in processing scientific/mathematical data, and examine the process for representing physical systems as mathematical models.cooperative education and internships assist students in the career development process by enabling them to examine their abilities, values, and interests while applying them to an actual career experience.
