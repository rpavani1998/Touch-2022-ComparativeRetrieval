it is a single stopping point of information which allows contribution from any physical therapist.generally speaking, companies are "for profit" and of course, they have to calculate their return on investment in any endeavor.i want to say yes to helping the whole profession - members or not members of our association, united states citizens or not... in this situation, i want my association to choose to collaborate and help all.i don't want my membership dollars going toward some spin-off product that won't be as good... and i don't want my membership dollars going toward something that discludes so many by elevating others to contribute because they were nominated and have "experience"...a researcher has an idea... the first step is always a literature search to learn what is known in the field about the idea.any successful company always, always researches what is out there in the world before even beginning to create a new product or offer a new service.it's a great free product for anyone with internet access.an expert becomes an expert via engagement, discussion and communication.the first step is always a literature search to learn what is known in the field about the idea.individual physical therapists and our associations most certainly are not "for profit."no one becomes an expert in a lone environment.experts are curious individuals.i would like to think the apta not only wants us americans to be "evidence based," but would also like to see canadians and scottish and british and dutch and australian and mexican and italian and african and...our american physical therapy association didn't do its homework.from what i read on pt now, the product won't be as good as what is already out there.
