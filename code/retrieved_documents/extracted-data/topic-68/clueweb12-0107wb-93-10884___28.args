the true total cost of ownership of online learning materials is high if one does an actual accounting that factors in all the costs associated with the countless elements that typically contribute to a curriculum, from information technologies staff and faculty to the costs of wired infrastructure, hardware, software, security, subscriptions to data repositories, maintenance of digital labs, funding for curriculum development and maintenance, and so on.
some of these resources provide opt-in, context-sensitive help, such as directions for using a learning/course management system or a certain software program.
games, simulations, and immersive learning can contextualize the learning (to enhance "situated cognition").
endnotes back to article this basic template for considering ways to update and revise an online course can be tailored to various course revision situations by adding questions.
it can be used, for example, with student "outliers," such as the novice (a learner who is inexperienced and naïve but aims to become expert in a particular field) and the amateur (a naïve learner who seeks only a surface understanding of a particular field and does not aim for future expertise).
figure 2 shows how, at "five after," student work has already left the classroom and has potential commercial applications — thus often changing student rights to use particular copyrighted materials.
some programs use undergraduate research as a means to increase student retention and help them bridge to graduate-level learning.8 cumulative activities such as e-portfolio building support student reflection on their learning, provide a vehicle for students to receive feedback from experts, and enhance peer learning.
e. this solution is too expensive.
while ideally value will be designed into an online curriculum from the start, the reality is that, across the spectrum of e-learning, there is a wide range of quality.
the creation of a basic packet for inheriting instructors, with insider tips about instructional methods, strategies, and resources, ensures the smoother transition of a course from one professor to another.
while learners base their decisions to continue in or drop out of a course on a range of reasons, only some of which instructors can influence, instructors do play an important role in helping learners, including adult students, acclimate to an online classroom.
instructors and course designers can enhance the online learner experience and make it more real and engaging through applications of rich, multimodal, multimedia, and full-sensory (visual and sound) immersive learning.
lacking a way to add metadata when he made the slideshows and having no raw image repository, he had no way to establish either provenance or ownership of the images.
by contrast, value-added technological updates involve the uses of high-tech resources to enhance learning experiences.
in addition, curricular updates can introduce important new content, and may also introduce pedagogical enhancements that can improve the quality of e-learning.
similarly, practices within domains can change, in both research and applications in the field.
to explore his options, see "modeling proper handling of intellectual property." informed by a constant stream of new research and information, domain fields change constantly.
researchers have found that such a presence enhances the learning experience but does not have a direct effect on "perceived learning, satisfaction, engagement, or the quality of their final course product.
the frequency of online course element updates1.
apart from those legitimate avenues, course developers are sometimes tempted to take decidedly riskier and ill-advised routes, swiping content off the world wide web without checking the content's provenance, ownership, or rights protection.
the assumption is that experts in the field will be able to intuit the curriculum creator's intentions through the course's syllabus, assignments, assessments, lectures, and other elements.
course attractions could also involve trips abroad, participation in professional conferences, fieldwork, and other inducements.
targeting curriculum for different learning needs — including different developmental phases, different primary languages, and different learning contexts (cultural, geographical, social, political, technological, and domain field) — can enhance both individual and group learning experiences.
a well-designed curriculum for online learning nurtures both student learning and student retention.
the educational research literature includes many important findings about what is effective for online teaching and learning.
worse yet, developers might bypass digital rights management (drm) protections around certain works in order to build their online learning collection.
effective updating of course curriculums to support and engage learners will encourage their persistence in the course and ultimately in their program of study, promoting degree attainment.
a team built a virtual space in second life to demonstrate the adaptations possible to meet the needs of people with disabilities.
he also knows of some images available on public image-sharing.
apart from those legitimate avenues, course developers are sometimes tempted to take decidedly riskier and ill-advised routes, swiping content off the world wide web without checking the content's provenance, ownership, or rights protection.
c. book knowledge without lived knowledge is a limiting option.
as one practical example, data that show that students are hard-pressed to submit work in particular times of a learning term can help the professor schedule heavier work at a different time.
his educational resources include slideshows and images illustrating his lectures, with materials pulled from multiple online sources.
games, simulations, and immersive learning can contextualize the learning (to enhance "situated cognition").
games may evoke more positive emotions in learners toward the subject matter.7 informational structures and ontologies help learners form mental models of dynamic interrelationships and systems.
also important is the human-facilitated capability of adjusting a curriculum to meet the unique needs of a range of online learners.
an instructor teaching about weather and flight uses numerous images found on the world wide web and the internet to illustrate his slideshows and talks.
the course designer should clearly define the e-learning trajectory and pacing and properly design them for the particular levels of learners.
updating online curriculums — whether through tweaks or paradigm shifts — offers a key way to increase learner retention and success.
the learning sequence needs to make developmental sense: foundational knowledge should be addressed first, followed by discussions of more complex content.
the uses of role plays in these situations enable learners to empathize with certain roles and to view strategic interplays of various entities in a system.
or, she could partner with another department on campus.
courses could be linked to external repositories of digital resources, add-on functionalities (such as e-portfolios and galleries), and immersive worlds to add learning value.
these are only freshman and sophomore students.
she could just assume a diverse audience would relate to characters derived from the mainstream.
responsiveness to learner feedback both during and after the course may ease student frustrations, both by addressing their challenges and concerns and by respecting their voices.
they set a professional and respectful tone by adhering to applicable laws and policies.
while different workplace contexts might emphasize these factors differently, and while many may include additional areas for update, answers to these questions are likely to have the greatest impacts on learning and the fundamental quality of the curriculum.
figure 2 shows how, at "five after," student work has already left the classroom and has potential commercial applications — thus often changing student rights to use particular copyrighted materials.
an online course curriculum that reflects the instructor's ability to stay current with research and developments in a particular discipline, perhaps in tandem with relevant interdisciplinary knowledge, will enhance learning by ensuring that students have the most current and relevant information.
available technologies enable developers to include alt (alternative) text for imagery, as well as transcription and captioning for audios, narrated slideshows, videos, and simulations, and to build accessible learning objects.
redesigning an online curriculum presents rich opportunities to integrate the latest thinking in given disciplines and to incorporate new methodologies for teaching and learning.
project-based learning can encourage students to engage in unwieldy projects, either alone, in pairs, or as part of multidisciplinary teams.
cross-cultural alliances between institutions can lead to richer learning.
there may be contractual challenges with a faculty member who is taking a curriculum commercial if he or she was paid to create the work for an accredited nonprofit institution of higher education.
conceptual domain-level modeling and innovations this domain-level of mastery results in expert-level analysis and expert-level knowledge of interrelationships in a particular field.
a four-fold approach for updating an online curriculum a variety of factors can impede or preclude substantive updates in course content, including a lack of dedicated resources (budget, time, expertise); a lack of political will at the administrative level; inertia on the part of those who first developed the curriculum; and a protectionist attitude toward the existing course on the part of the course developers.
students in many academic, design, and research-based courses will originate new ideas, lines of research, and innovations that have research and development implications.
similarly, they can become dated by virtue of changes in their learning/course management system, web browser, media player, virtual world space, or related elements and layers of the technological dependencies required for online learning.
the figure shows the overall course trajectory in a developmental and modular structure.
c. they should convey book knowledge and not worry about the real-world lived knowledge yet.
a course trajectory may be built on an informational structure that shows a clear progression of learning and ensures that learners have the information they need at a particular time.
beyond a simple instruction packet, full documentation of the entire course is also a necessary component of optimal curriculum design.
other readily available guidelines, such as thequality matters rubric, also provide valuable reality checks that can help inform a curricular redesign effort.
students have intellectual property rights to much of the work that they create in an academic course — including partial rights to co-developed works created by a student team.
challenge: this professor wants to model the proper uses of resources for his students by not contravening others' intellectual property rights.
this is especially noticeable in research institutions that emphasize applied and theoretical research.
other researchers have found that direct personal attention may relieve adult anxieties about school and increase learner retention.13 some instructors plan synchronous events — with guest speakers, complex role plays in virtual worlds, and cross-institutional learning exchanges — to enhance the value of the learning.
by shalin hai-jew to remain fresh and relevant, online courses need to be continually revised and improved.
successful early assignments help build online learner efficacy.
he pursued copyright releases for materials that he couldn't verify were fully available and kept documentation of the releases.
for shared, inherited courses that a group of instructors teach, the faculty may share their notes about lessons learned from their hands-on use of the curriculum and the experiences they had while teaching the course.
the team also wanted to accommodate learners from around the world in their own locales, helping them understand some of the government structures put into place for human public health.
the informational value of learning materials must be preserved over time.
a trajectory helps learners get a sense of where they are in the curriculum, where they're going, and where they've been, at any time in a course.
she should use words and other descriptors to give a sense of the physical aspects of these grains.
here, instructors are valued not only for their support of learners but for their contributions of new learning through their own work, their collaborations with colleagues, and student research under their tutelage.
course attractions could also involve trips abroad, participation in professional conferences, fieldwork, and other inducements.
conversant knowledge in those peripheral fields will be necessary.
because they work within a componentized environment, course designers have considerable flexibility in reworking the modular curriculum and can switch content in and out at will.
the uses of role plays in these situations enable learners to empathize with certain roles and to view strategic interplays of various entities in a system.
the instructor might address his or her pedagogical strategies and course expectations.
instructors need to help students understand the legal issues implicit in their work and keep within the law as constructive contributors in their respective fields.
scaffolding can effectively help a range of learners remain engaged.
e. requiring travel is too expensive for a fully online course.
on jan. 11, shalin presented "on the z-axis: research into immersive learning" for igi-global via elluminate (v.10).
to understand the nuances of handling property rights appropriately in a classroom situation, consider the case of a professor teaching a class on weather and flight.
because raw digital data captures tend to be the "least lossy," they must be protected for potential later use and possible editing into different file types and digital learning objects.
some of these resources provide opt-in, context-sensitive help, such as directions for using a learning/course management system or a certain software program.
the instructor might address his or her pedagogical strategies and course expectations.
students have intellectual property rights to much of the work that they create in an academic course — including partial rights to co-developed works created by a student team.
curriculums might need redesigns to be more inclusive, particularly of groups whose voices have not always been fully heard,5 even requiring translation of content into different languages.
the better an online course build is documented, the more easily it is preserved into the future.
students can push the edges of the academic and outside worlds by engaging in professional or amateur competitions, apprenticeships, service learning, and work-study endeavors.
in addition, the flexibility of online course design enables faculty members to update teaching and learning methodologies.
once online courses are developed and implemented, however, their curriculum might not be changed or updated for some time, if ever.
because they work within a componentized environment, course designers have considerable flexibility in reworking the modular curriculum and can switch content in and out at will.
in making work accessible, subject matter experts focus on making sure that the informational value of the images and other digital elements is equal for all users.
while some instructors might consider a course design complete once the course has been created, periodic or even regular updates can greatly enrich a course.
as the realities of a field evolve, they can have reverberating impacts.
b. he should switch out all the images and put in ones from respected sources that put images in the public domain.
successful early assignments help build online learner efficacy.
here, instructors are valued not only for their support of learners but for their contributions of new learning through their own work, their collaborations with colleagues, and student research under their tutelage.
the scaffolding concept can also effectively enhance learning for expert outliers at the other end of the bell curve of learners, perhaps through the study of more advanced research topics.
the availability of camcorders, digital cameras, scanners, microscope-mounted cameras, digital microphones, and desktop lecture-capture software enables virtually anyone to become a producer of digital content.
he wants to make sure all of his slideshows and desktop lecture captures used only images that he has fair rights to use.
these characters were professionally designed in second life as avatars.
in addition, curricular updates can introduce important new content, and may also introduce pedagogical enhancements that can improve the quality of e-learning.
some faculty use case studies to enliven discussion and show how theories apply in real-world situations.
also, building a curriculum with an eye toward eventual inheritance can reduce the idiosyncratic elements in course materials.
new thinking could lead to changes in what is considered ethical in a particular field.
everyday exposure to sophisticated production values in multimedia applications creates expectations among students that online courses will have similar production values; anything less can draw negative responses about the course as a whole.
conversant knowledge in those peripheral fields will be necessary.
students form professional networks and personal friendships.
this suggests a powerful ability to analyze problems and troubleshoot them in a live situation.
in higher level courses, problem-based learning can be effective.
these relatively new technologies enable students to represent ideas in different formats, which enhances their deep learning along both visual/spatial and auditory/verbal information channels.14 material that originated in digital form can be readily deployed in online immersive sites or on different platforms.
the materials need to be accessible, and both deliverable by a university and receivable by its learners.
they might include interviews, simulations, role plays, interactive spaces, photo collections, and other types of files.
applying the latest pedagogical methods can enhance the online learning experience.
it also suggests the ability to conceptualize new research and to carry through that research to fruition and to contribute new knowledge to the field.
works created in classes may fall under "fair use" in terms of the materials used in the student papers, portfolios, designs, drawings, and multimedia — but those works cannot be used under "fair use" if students are using the works for out-of-classroom purposes.
there may be contractual challenges with a faculty member who is taking a curriculum commercial if he or she was paid to create the work for an accredited nonprofit institution of higher education.
new, emerging, and evolving technologies can greatly enhance work to update the curriculum of an online course.
other readily available guidelines, such as thequality matters rubric, also provide valuable reality checks that can help inform a curricular redesign effort.

because students have a right to their own image and voice, they need to sign releases before a class can be captured on video, audio, or even in still images.
digital labs, simulations, and immersive experiences need to function as scripted.
students may also apply skills in apprenticeships out in the community, in service learning (whether locally, domestically or abroad), fieldwork, and field research.
also important is the human-facilitated capability of adjusting a curriculum to meet the unique needs of a range of online learners.
works used with the permissions of third-party content providers (often contingent on learners using particular purchased textbooks) will likely need to be removed.
a variety of factors can impede or preclude substantive updates in course content, including a lack of dedicated resources (budget, time, expertise); a lack of political will at the administrative level; inertia on the part of those who first developed the curriculum; and a protectionist attitude toward the existing course on the part of the course developers.
some programs use undergraduate research as a means to increase student retention and help them bridge to graduate-level learning.8 cumulative activities such as e-portfolio building support student reflection on their learning, provide a vehicle for students to receive feedback from experts, and enhance peer learning.
courses might include such assignments as the creation of a faux history for a criminology class, role-playing global interrelationships for a political science course, preparation of a feast for a nutrition class, or creation of a simple digital game for a computer science course.
informational learning this level of learning is the type conveyed in survey and introductory courses.
to enrich the learning experience, "digital storytelling" involves the creation of narratives and shared experiences using multimedia.3 figure 4 outlines one approach to a course trajectory, a course folder structure from the introduction to public health course.
thanks to the various principal investigators and professors with whom i worked on the various projects described here.
an academic course becomes a commercial work once it is used as part of a profit-making venture, outside the bounds of the umbrella implicit in an institution's nonprofit status.
she had written a script with various characters that would interact in supportive and real-life ways.
in making work accessible, subject matter experts focus on making sure that the informational value of the images and other digital elements is equal for all users.
the process also involves instructional design (how the online learning experience is conceptualized and created) and development/scripting work (how the digital materials are created) to ensure that the digital learning objects fully comply with accessibility requirements.
instructors sometimes solicit informal feedback from learners at the end of the term.
because students have a right to their own image and voice, they need to sign releases before a class can be captured on video, audio, or even in still images.
segues between modules, courses (in a degree program), or sequences add coherence for learners, connecting students more directly with the content and enriching learning.
a faculty member worked with a team to build a virtual space in second life to showcase the adaptations that could meet the needs of people with disabilities.
a. they should do video tours of facilities stateside and explain how the various public health offices or water treatment facilities or other offices work.
an online learning experience that adheres to legal principles will uphold the reputation of the university and protect the rights of students.
a. video tours would be a stand-in for some types of site visits.
in further developing the concepts introduced in this virtual world, a series of videos were created showcasing problems faced by caregivers and healthy solutions to them.
a curriculum might require tailoring content to a particular context, whether cultural, geographical, social, political, technological, or specific to a domain field.
figure 5 shows the conceptualization of the minority outliers on a bell curve, with novices and amateurs at one end and expert outliers at the other.
students who take courses with peers often are more motivated and committed to continue in their learning.
haptic devices (in direct-manipulation animation) have been integrated with 3d virtual spaces for a more full-sensory experience.
new thinking could lead to changes in what is considered ethical in a particular field.
many assessments that are effective in the face-to-face classroom also work well in the online classroom.6 there are many ways to create value-added learning for online studies.
however, he has limited time to make changes to his extensive curriculum.
an academic course becomes a commercial work once it is used as part of a profit-making venture, outside the bounds of the umbrella implicit in an institution's nonprofit status.
private academic, health, and other student information may not be publicly shared.
they have a major responsibility to create a rewarding learning experience that actualizes learner skills and knowledge.

the learning sequence needs to make developmental sense: foundational knowledge should be addressed first, followed by discussions of more complex content.
when he looked for a particular image, he found several versions (with different names and labels) on various sites, but he could not establish the original owner or even a consistent name for each image.
this is especially noticeable in research institutions that emphasize applied and theoretical research.
answer: d. the team created flexible assignments that would allow learners to capitalize on their local public health resources in order to learn about the on-ground realities where they lived.
moving forward a grain science instructor had used a paper-bound book with samples of actual grains in plastic bags stapled into the pages for many semesters.
as the instructional designer on this project, i created and conducted all the interviews.)
similarly, practices within domains can change, in both research and applications in the field.
b. web-based tours may also substitute for some live visits.
before student-created works are used for future courses, publications, or other similar applications, faculty members and administrators need to ensure that students officially release their rights for those purposes in writing.
the use of the latest relevant technologies for lecture capture, synchronous interactivity, simulations, student interactivity and intercommunications, student group work, research, design, and other learning activities can all improve the learner experience.
targeting curriculum for different learning needs — including different developmental phases, different primary languages, and different learning contexts (cultural, geographical, social, political, technological, and domain field) — can enhance both individual and group learning experiences.
the scaffolding of learner interactivity supports learner retention and may combat "feelings of isolation, lack of self-direction and management, and (an) eventual decrease in motivation levels.
faculty in online courses benefit from information streams with learners and other stakeholders.
scaffolding can effectively help a range of learners remain engaged.
given the breadth of the four areas, one faculty member will probably not be able to engage the issues of laws and policies, information quality, curricular strategies, and updated technologies; ideally, a healthy institution of higher education will have support offices that provide a range of course design support services to faculty along with subject matter experts, perhaps as part of ad hoc teams.
in this context, this means the ability of people with a range of different types of abilities, including those with visual acuity, sound acuity, mobility, and symbolic processing challenges, to access an online course and curriculum.
e. she can abandon the series idea and just use different avatar characters each time.
rarely do we step back to fundamentally assess the raison d'etre for a given curriculum — to examine the essential cultural factors that undergird that curriculum and the purposes for which it was created.1 analyses at that level have great potential to enrich a curriculum.
to understand the nuances of handling property rights appropriately in a classroom situation, consider the case of a professor teaching a class on weather and flight.
e-learning path or trajectory a core challenge in an online curriculum is to create a coherent e-learning path or trajectory, particularly for online learning deployed through multiple technologies or a learning/course management system.
to explore the additional issues involved in successful redesign of an online course curriculum, see "further considerations for curricular updates." updating an e-learning course, whether through modest tweaks or a total overhaul, can help make a course more competitive, memorable, and effective.
by shalin hai-jew a well-designed curriculum for online learning nurtures both student learning and student retention.
from the value perspective, the selection of instructional technologies depends on a robust assessment of learning needs.15 technological advancements also affect the types of tools used for learning.
while different workplace contexts might emphasize these factors differently, and while many may include additional areas for update, answers to these questions are likely to have the greatest impacts on learning and the fundamental quality of the curriculum.
instructors who maintain a course revision journal to capture the suggestions can apply these ideas to new designs, or they can integrate them immediately in the master course.
these are 3d and can be handled in a tactile way.
the speed of change will leave behind those who do not move with the technological current.
the content has to be portable between technological systems.
the instructor can include examples that have no apparent solution, even for subject matter experts, or where the "answer" involves complex, open-ended designs with varying and competing degrees of appropriateness for the context (as, for example, in land-use proposals in the context of landscape architecture).
digital content can be edited at one's desktop through video editing, image editing, and sound editing software.
those who inherit a course will have a clearer range of choices and motion if they know the provenance of all the contents, if the digital materials are properly annotated and reasonably accessible, and if the original pedagogical plans are shared.
the students were asked to share their findings with each other for an effective "jigsaw" experience.
this is certainly true of course content.
students may create rich works for digital gallery shows, or they might conduct research and write up their findings in integrative papers.
c. is an option, but it still leaves him and the university with liabilities for the resources that possibly contravene copyright.
private academic, health, and other student information may not be publicly shared.
available technologies enable developers to include alt (alternative) text for imagery, as well as transcription and captioning for audios, narrated slideshows, videos, and simulations, and to build accessible learning objects.
many online courses, modules, and digital learning objects are not built with instructor inheritance in mind.
the documentation may include legal documents, such as contracts, grants, formal letters of support, memorandums of agreement or understanding, media rights releases, copyright releases, and permissions.
before student-created works are used for future courses, publications, or other similar applications, faculty members and administrators need to ensure that students officially release their rights for those purposes in writing.
to accommodate a diversity of learners with different learning preferences and styles — such as kinesthetic/tactile, auditory/visual, logical/mathematical, musical/rhythmic, verbal/linguistic, visual/spatial, and interpersonal/intrapersonal — might require diversifying assessments to include a wider range of formative and summative measurements.
the technology could not provide fullmachinima captures, and the human-embodied avatar faces weren't realistically expressive.
conversion of the original to an e-book made the material more accessible to students, as explained in "a grain science e-book."
it might also include raw files from photo shoots, videography sessions, audio sessions,machinima captures, and lecture captures.
note the placement of the heat adjustments on the stove — up-front, they will not require reaching to the back of the stovetop — and the lower-height countertop to accommodate wheelchairs.
faculty adherence to the law can help keep legal liabilities for both the institution and the respective faculty member in check.
she could just use the pre-made avatars without any changes but using a variety of diverse voices and accents for the actors.
faculty members have other pathways to content: they can create their own content; use content released to the public domain; access open-source (and royalty-free) resources; or use content released through variouscreative commons licenses.
given the breadth of the field and its changing nature (the h1n1 flu epidemic hit during the building of the course), the team wanted to bring in varied types of expertise to help learners.
consequently, virtually every online course can benefit from periodic curricular updates.
a curriculum might require tailoring content to a particular context, whether cultural, geographical, social, political, technological, or specific to a domain field.
value-added learning extra credits field trips case studies digital labs research opportunities student publications student gallery shows student e-portfolios the add-on of tech-intensive learner experiences the uses of a richer array of tech-enabled research streams (as relevant)…such as with remote sensing, geographical information systems, digital repositories and referatories (like themultimedia educational resource for learning and online teaching from merlot), and so on the addition of metadata to learning objects for findability and accurate labeling
the professor actually went through and scrubbed his extant slideshows and lectures and swapped in images from the public domain.
this way, she could have diverse characters at a small cost, with a kind of narrative and character-based continuity.
the course updated file types the portability and transferability of digital objects the usability of digital objects in various technological systems/socio-technological systems integration of open-source resources integration of virtual/immersive worlds (in alignment with new assignments) anything that needs updates for functioning (staying ahead of technological obsolescence) every academic year relevant new laws, state policies, and campus policies third-party publisher-created contents e-books published articles

applying the latest pedagogical methods can enhance the online learning experience.
through the family education rights and privacy act (ferpa), students have privacy rights that protect much of their non-directory types of information.
virtual worlds enable the creation of discovery learning spaces; they also enable live simulations with other human-embodied avatars for different social scenarios and digital dramaturgy.
in this context, this means the ability of people with a range of different types of abilities, including those with visual acuity, sound acuity, mobility, and symbolic processing challenges, to access an online course and curriculum.
on the other hand, many forces can stimulate a curricular update, including the availability of external or internal grant funds, a push from administrators for higher course quality, an impending visit by an accreditation team, or the emergence of the need for a new degree or program that builds on the substructure inherent in existing courses.
at the micro level, unique changes to a course — such as the inclusion of guest speakers with plenty of real-world experiences, multi-language accommodations, or the inclusion of original student work samples — would improve the learner experience.
an immersive and interactive space demonstrates accessibility in action.
the enriching of a curriculum through more customized assignments and more learner feedback and choices on the topics of study improved student interactivity improved instructor feedback loops the integration of new technologies
e. he should purchase all curricular contents from third-party content providers and get out of the business of creating his own teaching contents.
at the macro level, changes may be made to the superstructures outside of a class to enhance its value by linking it to a sequence of learning or a powerful applied learning context (service learning or study abroad programs are good examples).
a course trajectory may be built on an informational structure that shows a clear progression of learning and ensures that learners have the information they need at a particular time.
works used with the permissions of third-party content providers (often contingent on learners using particular purchased textbooks) will likely need to be removed.
back-end data mining in the learning/course management system can also be highly instructive.
the contributing student pedagogy also focuses on building "increased content understanding, improved generic skills, increased motivation, increased satisfaction, increased confidence, (and) improved social skills" — all of which contribute to learner retention.4 instructors might also design opt-in resources for students who seek assistance.
she could ignore this issue and go with "generic" avatars.
the figure shows the overall course trajectory in a developmental and modular structure.
to accommodate a diversity of learners with different learning preferences and styles — such as kinesthetic/tactile, auditory/visual, logical/mathematical, musical/rhythmic, verbal/linguistic, visual/spatial, and interpersonal/intrapersonal — might require diversifying assessments to include a wider range of formative and summative measurements.
faculty adherence to the law can help keep legal liabilities for both the institution and the respective faculty member in check.
"17 learner successes in learning, course by course, are a critical building block to their persistence.
that means that a massive retrofitting will be required.
the contributing student pedagogy also focuses on building "increased content understanding, improved generic skills, increased motivation, increased satisfaction, increased confidence, (and) improved social skills" — all of which contribute to learner retention.4 instructors might also design opt-in resources for students who seek assistance.
worse yet, developers might bypass digital rights management (drm) protections around certain works in order to build their online learning collection.

through the family education rights and privacy act (ferpa), students have privacy rights that protect much of their non-directory types of information.
instructors help connect learners to the campus, which can improve retention.3 they play a critical role in connecting learners to resources on campus.
e. she should partner with another institution of higher learning and collaborate on a digital grain "laboratory" that offers high-resolution images in 2d and 3d, enabling learner immersion in the grain work.
the process also involves instructional design (how the online learning experience is conceptualized and created) and development/scripting work (how the digital materials are created) to ensure that the digital learning objects fully comply with accessibility requirements.
while ideally value will be designed into an online curriculum from the start, the reality is that, across the spectrum of e-learning, there is a wide range of quality.
she had a digital camera mounted on a microscope and instructed a graduate student to capture the images of the various grains at several levels of magnification, with digital images of a measure to help learners get a sense of the actual size.
as a serious professional, he wants to uphold the standards of the field.
she might design the avatars visually and in dialogue and behavior to be strategically ambiguous in terms of backgrounds.
they invited experts in public health, gerontology, human-animal bonds and health, lab biosecurity measures, global food production, rabies, and national agricultural defense to speak on camera about their work and concerns.
putting the book together required painstaking human labor to create the bags, staple them in, and make sure the pages of the book were complete.
however, she could take screen shots of the avatars in the online spaces, and she could bring in amateur voice actors to play the roles.
his educational resources include slideshows and images illustrating his lectures, with materials pulled from multiple online sources.
maintenance means ensuring that digital content is preserved against obsolescence and the "slow fires" that degrade technological content.
in addition, the flexibility of online course design enables faculty members to update teaching and learning methodologies.
instructors need to help students understand the legal issues implicit in their work and keep within the law as constructive contributors in their respective fields.
he should ignore intellectual property concerns and keep using his digital contents on a password-protected course site.
many assessments that are effective in the face-to-face classroom also work well in the online classroom.6 there are many ways to create value-added learning for online studies.
games may evoke more positive emotions in learners toward the subject matter.7 informational structures and ontologies help learners form mental models of dynamic interrelationships and systems.
project-based learning can encourage students to engage in unwieldy projects, either alone, in pairs, or as part of multidisciplinary teams.
updates in teaching and learning methodologies while some instructors might consider a course design complete once the course has been created, periodic or even regular updates can greatly enrich a course.
participation and interactions with learners in an online classroom help create a stronger telepresence, or sense of "being" in the classroom, on the part of the instructor.
they provide academic advisement.
on the other hand, many forces can stimulate a curricular update, including the availability of external or internal grant funds, a push from administrators for higher course quality, an impending visit by an accreditation team, or the emergence of the need for a new degree or program that builds on the substructure inherent in existing courses.
the system might also note which files learners access and what class-related message boards and activities they like the best, data that can spark ideas for enhanced student participation.
courses can become dated by virtue of the authoring tools used to create their content, including text files, the slideshows, the audio, the imagery, and the video.
another strategy is to create formal and informal (back-end) channels for learner feedback.
for human-facilitated courses, instructors also make themselves more widely available to support student learning by providing information, access to resources, constructive critiques, and rich learning opportunities.
then she had an instructional designer (me) put together the electronic book, which has long replaced the paper one.
in practice, they may occur in a piecemeal way.
peer learners give feedback and support each other's learning.
b. she could make each of the characters clearly represent a different demographic niche.
a trajectory helps learners get a sense of where they are in the curriculum, where they're going, and where they've been, at any time in a course.
the interrelationships between domain-field elements that affect a curriculum given the reality of ongoing, often significant change in domain fields, it is imperative that faculty members stay apprised of the discoveries in their particular areas of expertise — certainly in the general interest of building new knowledge, but also in revising the curriculum for an online course.
it can also reveal students' expectations about the course materials, enabling the instructor to address misperceptions.
tools from that realm — including establishing processes for effective online learning, templating digital learning objects and modules for quality, defining clear work flows and decision junctures, adhering to standards of legality and ethics, and applying wise leadership and project management—offer a powerful approach to the development and refinement of quality curricula.
the reality is that e-learning is predicated on layers of technological and human resources dependencies.
segues between modules, courses (in a degree program), or sequences add coherence for learners, connecting students more directly with the content and enriching learning.
endnotes depending on organizational priorities, online course curricular updates may occur at various intervals.
she wanted to have characters whom a range of people could relate to, in terms of race, age, ethnicity, culture, and other aspects.
encouraging interrelationships between learners helps improve student retention and degree completion rates.
that means that a massive retrofitting will be required.
to save on the labor and other costs, the faculty member commissioned an electronic book.
an online learning experience that adheres to legal principles will uphold the reputation of the university and protect the rights of students.

the books were stored in a cabinet and doled out each semester to a small group of students.
it can be used, for example, with student "outliers," such as the novice (a learner who is inexperienced and naïve but aims to become expert in a particular field) and the amateur (a naïve learner who seeks only a surface understanding of a particular field and does not aim for future expertise).
the scalability of some of these online experiences can help learning experiences feel more personal and intimate, particularly in larger sections of courses where direct one-on-one interaction with the instructor is rare.
progress and change in domain fields informed by a constant stream of new research and information, domain fields change constantly.
curriculums might need redesigns to be more inclusive, particularly of groups whose voices have not always been fully heard,5 even requiring translation of content into different languages.
the accompanying slideshow will be available at the above url.
pages from the grain science e-book challenge: the instructor still wants learners to get a sense of the grains in a three-dimensional sense.
to enrich the learning experience, "digital storytelling" involves the creation of narratives and shared experiences using multimedia.3 figure 4 outlines one approach to a course trajectory, a course folder structure from the introduction to public health course.
this initial level of learning sets the groundwork of understandings in a field.
students may create rich works for digital gallery shows, or they might conduct research and write up their findings in integrative papers.
the more complex the content, the more diverse the learner skill sets, and the more divergent the preferred modes of learning, the harder it is to create a coherent sense of a singular path.

figure 5 shows the conceptualization of the minority outliers on a bell curve, with novices and amateurs at one end and expert outliers at the other.
works created in classes may fall under "fair use" in terms of the materials used in the student papers, portfolios, designs, drawings, and multimedia — but those works cannot be used under "fair use" if students are using the works for out-of-classroom purposes.
any help would be deeply appreciated.
learners may participate in professional online conferences and digital poster sessions.
students can push the edges of the academic and outside worlds by engaging in professional or amateur competitions, apprenticeships, service learning, and work-study endeavors.
the more complex the content, the more diverse the learner skill sets, and the more divergent the preferred modes of learning, the harder it is to create a coherent sense of a singular path.
the use of the latest relevant technologies for lecture capture, synchronous interactivity, simulations, student interactivity and intercommunications, student group work, research, design, and other learning activities can all improve the learner experience.
for example, the system may capture patterns of when students participate in class.
she should check the open-source world for full 3d captures of the various grains that she's using in her courses.
i am grateful to the anonymous peer reviewers who gave me plenty of constructive and insightful feedback to improve this work.
some faculty use case studies to enliven discussion and show how theories apply in real-world situations.
a grain science instructor had used a paper-bound book with samples of grain, which restricted use to relatively few students and required a great deal of labor to maintain.
rarely do we step back to fundamentally assess the raison d'etre for a given curriculum — to examine the essential cultural factors that undergird that curriculum and the purposes for which it was created.1 analyses at that level have great potential to enrich a curriculum.
students in many academic, design, and research-based courses will originate new ideas, lines of research, and innovations that have research and development implications.
they need grounded learning that taps into lived experiences1 and are motivated by the usefulness of information and skills.2
students will often communicate directly with instructors and offer ideas via e-mails and telephone calls, all information-rich ways to capture suggestions.
other learning may occur in augmented physical spaces ("mixed reality"), with digital installations built for immersive experiences that take advantage of proprioception and muscle memory.
it can also reveal students' expectations about the course materials, enabling the instructor to address misperceptions.
in this model, learners work on shared independent projects.
in this case, the principal investigator chose to go with strategic ambiguity in the characters.
as needed intellectual property corrections accessibility retrofitting for machine readability, textual annotations, and other accommodations media rights releases for video/audio/digital still image and other captures of student learning and activities universal design retrofitting sme guest speakers' presentations and resources scaffolding for novices/amateurs and experts (with learning aids, games, opt-in help, and other elements)
