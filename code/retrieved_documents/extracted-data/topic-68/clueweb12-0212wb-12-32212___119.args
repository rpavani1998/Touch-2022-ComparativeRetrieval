unfortunately, online formats do allow certain professors to hide behind the electronic cloak and politely excuse themselves from the equation, which greatly hurts the student.
on the other hand, all three groups of students thought unimportant the need to pay home phone bills incurred in online education, whereas bee
online literature library internet public library- references, magazines, newspapers, online texts.
as i added more aln modules in place of lectures, answers to these questions virtually all moved to "very heavy" and "very difficult."
"it certainly is not perfect," said mr. pepicello of some of the test scores.
at 4 am students can have lively interchanges on the site.
unfortunately, most would-be authors cling to the myth that if they just put in enough effort, people will automatically want to read what they write.
we can get a flavour of a new learning environment.
if you are interested, i'll be happy to send it to you (or give you the url) when it is available.
there are more dropouts than in actual on-campus courses - loss of commuinty/campus atmosphere - there are no current standards for program assessment, so it is difficult for students to know which courses will be worth the money they are spending - often, the high fees charged for some aln courses go to fund actual campus courses rather than the virtual courses being offered.
a drawback of the world wide web, however, is flow capacity (bandwidth) that can make transmissions very slow.
bob jensen's other documents glossaries education chapter 2 metacognition table of contents components of sln online courses need not be aln.
professor arvan concludes that the proportion of actual eager beavers may be overstated and, in their cases, the need for labor intensive discourse is different but nevertheless significant: i'd be remiss if i didn't say something about aln and eager beavers before concluding.
finding these instances of plagiarism was much easier in their web documents due to the ability to search for suspected phrases in web search engines.
the moral of the story: students would be better served with much of the curriculum being online.
dl seems better suited to mature learners with well-developed learning skills.
this environment will include a convergence of sound, video, and data with synchronous and asynchronous communication.
by formal study, i mean using the same instructors, the same materials, and essentially the same examinations.
there was no detailed curriculum information available on the e&y program, but it appeared to me that given the five things enumerated above, it would be impossible to accomplish such our own program for students not having more accounting prerequisites.
volume i: "a resource for campus leaders" reports the results of 231 interviews conducted with administrators, faculty, and students on online learning programs and initiatives.
one advantage to this program that both company enjoyed was that both companies didn't have to give up their employees to go back to a university campus for the 2 yr.

also see concerns about faculty resistance to change bob jensen's other documents glossaries education chapter 2 metacognition table of contents how to reduce messaging costs in aln courses the "cheap shot" way to reduce messaging costs is to virtually do away with messaging to course administrators by limiting messaging to only technical support in making the online or cd-rom course work on a given computer.
the establishment of such a university would cost less than the addition of a single classroom building on a physical college campus (approximately $15 million us).
thus, a student may have learned to estimate the answer to a math problem before beginning calculations as a way of checking the accuracy of his answer, but in the chemistry lab, the same student calculates the components of a compound without noticing that his estimates sum to more than 100 percent.
another example is california virtual university.
librarians will have to be proactive and learn about the new technologies and make the materials available to students all over the world.
in one class of 100 last month, freeman found that every student had private internet access.
after repeated exposure to either or both, the subject simply perceives the deep structure as part of the problem description.
sometimes online students initially believe the myth that online courses are easier than onsite courses and, therefore, take less time.
the program will use only full-time tenure-track faculty recognized for their quality of teaching in other kelley school programs.
mr. zogby says polls detect signs of society's emerging resistance to big institutions, and its de-emphasis on things and places.
kevin's message was less detailed, but it did give me my first insight into the curriculum.
to do so i provide as much literature as possible on cd-roms (many of which i record myself), my lan hard drive, and the university's web server.
in this course, the internet will be used for discussions among students (student listserv and webboard), faculty (faculty listserv and webboard) and experts, all from around the world.
for example, suppose you read these two sentences: “after years of pressure from the film and television industry, the president has filed a formal complaint with china over what u.s. firms say is copyright infringement.
about the only thing she hadn't done, it seemed, was to take a course from an online university.
cost savings may not be as dramatic in aln.
having taught students in conventional classrooms for two decades, i experienced the computer-mediated mode of instruction as more time-consuming, at least initially, both from the standpoint of up-front course design and later, painstaking, labor intensive hours online - designing messages for the classroom forum, reading and downloading from the screen, posting new material, providing feedback, checking community bulletin boards, e-mailing student comments and grade reports, etc.
it also takes longer for faculty members and administrators to reach consensus in electronic group meetings.
she considered the course to have a heavy workload august 11, 2009 reply from steve markoff [smarkoff@kimstarr.org] bob: i've always believed that the role of the teacher is one of facilitator.

students in most cases will be existing or incoming employees of the firms.
" higher education, he said in the interview, needs to take notice and adapt.
another less extreme extension is the mush which, like a mud, is an electronic space in which multiple persons (players, users, students) socialize, create "worlds," and interact in gaming or serious episodes.
thus, we have developed a unique program in which ernst & young will pay for you to obtain your master of science in accountancy at a premier institution while working at the firm.

in addition, the new economy requires a workforce capable of handling an exploding knowledge base.
their traditional lecture courses are often neat and tidy with problems assigned from the back of the textbook and sufficient material in the textbook or lectures to master the assigned materials.

also, some of our traditional courses perhaps should no longer meet in regularly scheduled class periods even if these courses are only made available to resident students.
"when you add up all the niche products, it's a market unto itself," he says.
freeman is the only observer able to read the messages.
mr. pepicello said he wished the seniors' scores were higher, particularly in math, but he considered all of the findings positive because they indicated that students improve when they attend.
if knowledge of how to solve a problem never transferred to problems with new surface structures, schooling would be inefficient or even futile—but of course, such transfer does occur.
pollack's view of what makes boys the way they are is less rooted in biology than gurian's.
what they found, ice said, was that “students are actually listening to the instructor and reading what they wrote so they have two sensory modes working at the same time,” which could actually improve cognition.
her problem is that she is just too busy to learn about computers.
we attribute this to the erroneous assumption that research rigor is excellence, a myth contradicted by the scientific method itself.
thirdly, the librarian's role "will shift to one of facilitator/instructor, rather than provider of information."
one problem that experimenters with aln are having is that budgets and material preparation time are inadequate for creating great aln content with creative navigation aids.
most aln courses assume that the email messages and chat line messages from a student are genuine without monitoring those messages with the same scrutiny that is given to course examinations.
professors need to organize lecture notes and other materials with more care.
but they do get their case published and enjoy each others’ company.
in addition, i create new homework sets every semester because i know my old ones are out there in cyberspace.
real boys earned a stamp of approval from mary pipher, who writes in the foreword that "our culture is doing a bad job raising boys.

- asynchronous cal can be extremely effective for learning technical material before coming to class.
neither e-mail nor chat, the forum classroom environment at fielding calls for and inspires thoughtful, composed (after reading and reflection) asynchronous networked interactions, without sacrificing human warmth.
she also worries that all this worrying—much of it, she says, from middle-class parents—could have a negative effect on boys, marking them as victims when they're nothing of the sort.
"it is where we are." in its report, phoenix shows the results from its 1,966 students who took the mapp test this year, compared with the national sample of more than 376,000 students from about 300 institutions.
this purchasing power will have a tremendous impact on who controls learning.
this shift in mindset will foster increased responsibility on the part of learners to take charge of their own learning and hence their careers.
the web address is http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/class/6e002/audio/index.html you can read more about web streaming athttp://www.trinity.edu/~rjensen/245glosf.htm#web5 - wireless communications --- portable computers can now be turned into cellular telephones such that students can communicate with faculty and each other with the flick of an antenna on the side of the computer.
one example of this is atuniversity of maryland university college where students can "chat" with librarians online and ask any questions they might have.
there are ways to overcome every obstacle the negative article described, with perhaps time being the toughest one to handle.
i decided that these "in-between" calls and on-line sessions were essential if i was going to keep them on track during the month between in person classes.

young hans also fantasizes about having a "widdler," as the boy puts it, as large as his father's.
they're concerned that such programs, in order to compete against all the stimuli vying for boys' attentions, have become more aggressively in-your-face, more fearlessly risk-taking, manlier than thou.
secondly, in the case of the casb, the students are all employed full time in chartered accountancy firms and are under heavy pressure to do well at all stages of the three year program.
students in the program are all full-time employees of pwc.
finding ways to decrease attrition in distance education classes and programs is critical both from an economical and quality viewpoint.
when aln becomes more widely deployed in existing courses, it becomes much easier to expand the curriulum by "buying into" selected off-campus aln courses from other colleges and universities.
an even greater proportion of those polled said it was their perception that employers and academic professionals thought more highly of traditional institutions than online ones.
we are sure to see a huge increase in aln used in the business environment.
often students must spend a great deal of time building foundations to even study the material.
if the aln materials contained artificial intelligence that identified the type of learner, it might be possible to reduce messaging costs by automatically varying the navigation options to learning styles and aptitudes.
the new book packaging boyhood: saving our sons from superheroes, slackers, and other media stereotypes offers an analysis of what boys soak in from tv shows, video games, toys, and other facets of boy-directed pop culture.
the system provides through a single url the student's access to course materials, discussion forums, virtual groups and chat, testing, grades, and electronic communication.
however, i predict that by year 2010 a significant proportion of required and elective courses will be globally networked by universities and business firms.
in a chapter titled "feminine boys," he writes of counseling the parents of a boy who liked to wear bracelets and perform a princess dance.
early evidence indicates that students do as well or better in acynchronous courses that do not meet in classrooms.
the results of the students' performance were put through statistical analysis and the null hypothesis was rejected for the cd/film and cd/text groups.
the common access restriction is a password that in the case of online course materials must be purchased.
when one is very familiar with a problem’s deep-structure, knowledge about how to solve it transfers well.
bob jensen's other documents glossaries education chapter 2 metacognition table of contents components of aln jack wilson at rensselaer polytechnic institute has had a great deal of experience in an aln program at rennsselaer.
at a later point she writes the following: aln courses can be dehumanized to such an extent that students will no longer feel as if they belong to a learning community.
that has really changed with arrival of web-based video, instant messaging and collaboration tools.
by formal study, i mean using the same instructors, the same materials, and essentially the same examinations.
“faculty who get involved in online teaching have to be more reflective about their teaching,” wilson said.
we have been using a conferencing program called firstclass to have students interact with each other, me, and on-line undergraduate tas.
in particular, the final report from stanford university is negative about current technologies for aln courses and calls cost problems "problematic."

it leads to an mba degree and does not compete with masters of accounting programs.
in research projects constituting over 50% of the course grade, they must seek out, sift, digest, and nurture a vast amount of learning material.
students generally voice complaints when workloads are unreasonable (they will not always complain when a course is too easy).
however, there is a fine line in aln between making alntoo easy versus making aln too hard.
in addition, nearly 64 percent of faculty said it takes 'somewhat more' or 'a lot more' effort to teach online compared to a face-to-face course.
real audio makes it possible to have radio broadcasts around the clock over the internet, and these broadcasts can come from any part of the world.
on-campus courses will be available for certifications across a wide variety of educational accomplishments.
this is the purported experience of the aln experiments in the college of commerce and business administration at the university of illinois under a relatively large grant from the sloan foundation.
until the evaluation culture is changed in peers who hold you on leash, try to do web publishing alongside your refereed journal publishing.
the students in the experiment were full time on campus students, such that the confounding problems of having adult part-time students was not a factor in the scale experiments of online, asynchronous learning.
the attention given to group process online and the thoughtful nature of masters-level conversations establish an intimacy within the group, belying the myth of impersonality.
the electronic version, however, is easier to search and index.
the above financial reporting & assurance services curriculum appears to me to be an outstanding curriculum for former accounting majors.
the "urge to message" phenomenon among students will come as no surprise to major corporations such as wal-mart, microsoft, and most other corporations that have very fine web sites but cannot afford the labor expenses of personally responding to email messages from customers and the public at large.
also there are huge differences between being connected to arteries (e.g., t1 lines) versus capillaries (modems).
as online learning spreads throughout higher education, so have calls for quality control and assessment.
freeman says: "students get completely immersed in the role playing.
- voice mail --- this can reach users and educators at times when they do not have access to computers.
faculty bring individual biases into peer evaluation, and at the moment web publishing is a new thing to most of them.
the casb program is flexible, combining the successful completion of a series of online modules with a three-year term of professional experience.
it will be delivered through multiple technologies including the internet, broadband cable, and satellite.
instead of leading the way, faculty in traditional schools and colleges are behind corporate and military/goverment trainers in adapting to technologies and learning experimentation.
though i believe there can be substantial benefit from utilizing aln in a course primarily composed of eager beavers, that use should be substantially different from what i have outlined above, because the teaching objective is different.
i also log on aim when students set up a time they want to meet.
in my earlier concerns i thought that you were intending to make students eligible to sit for the cpa examination and would offer a more traditional masters of accounting program that had more accounting prerequisites and/or more accounting courses required in the program.
according to the book, boys are being taught they have to be tough and cool, athletic and stoic.
the main difference is the lock-step calendar for the e&y master plan and possibly fewer choices due to the customized e&y calendar.
the impact on higher education a learning infrastructure based on digital technology offers more than just education as usual on the internet.
"this ties into our social mission for our university," said mr. pepicello, in an interview at the company's headquarters here.
i create a summary of the week, using snippets of chat that made me laugh, cry, or go omg.
a different kind of outcome for learners who are juggling work and family responsibilities, would be to be able to earn a degree or certification at home.
i created my own online text with links to spreadsheets, videos, and self-tests incorporated in the modules.
students who are motivated but find they cannot keep up the pace, may be able to slow down and take longer to complete a degree, and not just drop out in frustration.
the classes do not necessarily have to meet twice or three times a weeks as most do now, but rather as needed by the demands of students or by the judgement of the professor.
the experience of being a boy is exactly what miles groth wants to capture.
the report noted that only half of the faculty it surveyed reported receiving extra compensation.
computer networks offer the possibility of disintermediation -- that is, when the consumer can access services and information directly rather than going through an intermediary.
once again i remind you to visit the tools site at http://www.uwex.edu/disted/interactive.html bob jensen's other documents glossaries education chapter 2 metacognition table of contents mud, moo, and mush extensions a somewhat bolder extension of aln pedagogy entails having students create their own avatars and learning worlds.
“i’ve tried other methods, too, where you send the students a document and then also send them a [separate] sound file, and the effect is not nearly as strong; as a matter of fact, it’s barely significant when you do that,” ice said.
the lives of many online college students are not easy.
the main goal in the case of eager beavers is to promote high-quality discourse, rather than to offer a channel for getting help and to provide an incentive for doing the work.
mr. zogby said that differing attitudes in two polls within a year show that "the gap was closing"—and he said that wasn't as surprising as it might seem.
that particular article is entitled "daring professors" and contains audio and email messages from other faculty members who were willing to take some chances with their careers.
from there you can access some other interesting links.
the tools mentioned by at the by andrew wadsworth at http://talon.extramural.uiuc.edu/ws97/intro/tsld033.htm include the following: - print --- good aln courses may not be entirely paperless.
but there is still a huge workload in the internet-posted queries.
it was much more work to prepare and execute the course than i ever expected.
a central finding was that “universities must recognize this new way of learning and adapt or risk becoming obsolete.
there are many opportunities where aln may contribute to another outcome: lowering the cost of education, e.g., by naturally introducing new values for old measures such as student-faculty ratios.
still other courses are available from prominent consulting and accounting firms such as eds, andersen consulting, arthur d. little, price waterhouse, ernst & young, pricewaterhouse coopers, deloitte and touche, etc.
high attrition rates have a negative economic impact on universities.
the reason was not likely to be that online sections were easier.
in defining the word 'teaching', i think many people overemphasize the last transition that i mentioned, thinking that the primary movement of information is from them(the teacher) to the students.
an example is provided in a motorola corporation plant as follows: in 1994, 633 associates undertook 853 self-study courses.
re: distance learning with traditional undergraduate students peter made one comment that i suspect reflects the sentiments of many 20th century educators- any technology that detracts from our ability to physically connect with our students is going to diminish our career satisfaction.

there could be many reasons for this, but, especially in light of the u.s. department of education study, it seems that online learning has contributed meaningfully to their becoming better teachers.
our offload courses are paid at the same rate whether they are online of ftf.
about the only thing she hadn't done, it seemed, was to take a course from an online university.
so even though students have been taught how to solve a particular type of word problem, when the teacher or textbook changes the scenario, students still struggle to apply the solution because they don’t recognize that the problems are mathematically the same.
at the technology core of the global learning infrastructure are fully interoperable modules and an enabling infrastructure which will: extend access to virtually anyone including old and young, part- and full-time.
it is tough to mix former accounting majors with non-accounting majors who have only had a five week readiness program.
professor wilson also argues that good aln courses will still have both instructor-led and student-led learning in addition to pre-recorded aln learning materials.
we cap sections at 35 students.
she considered the course to have a heavy workload "u. of phoenix reports on its students' academic achievement, " by goldie blumenstyk,chronicle of higher education, june 5, 2008 ---  http://chronicle.com/daily/2008/06/3115n.htm?utm_source=at&utm_medium=en the 2006 national survey of student engagement, released november 13, 2006, for the first time offers a close look at distance education, offering provocative new data suggesting that e-learners report higher levels of engagement, satisfaction and academic challenge than their on-campus peers --- http://nsse.iub.edu/nsse_2006_annual_report/index.cfm "the engaged e-learner," by elizabeth redden, inside higher ed , november 13, 2006 --- http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/11/13/nsse september 4, 2009 message from carolyn kotlas [kotlas@email.unc.edu] report on online education study "more than one-third of public university faculty have taught an online course while more than one-half have recommended an online course to students . . . .

duke's pricey online b-school program is winning raves from students and rivals."
"we take these students and we do give them a significant increase in skills."
they are more likely to express empathy and affection through an activity, like playing basketball together, than having a heart-to-heart talk.
the main issue is that web publishing is not refereed with the same rigor (as refereeing in leading journals) or, in most cases, is not refereed at all.
for example, projects entailing both design and implementation of relational datatbases entail learning how to make complicated software work.
good design will not eliminate messaging, but great designs might eliminate an enormous proportion of the messages.
“if these rates of participation among faculty are going to continue to grow, institutions will have do a better job acknowledging the additional time and effort on the part of the faculty member,” said jeff seaman, co-director of the babson survey research group and the study’s lead researcher.
goldie came away from the course exhausted.
in most instances they do so without intent to cause great harm.
he predicts that in the coming decade, some universities will fail, especially those that have chased short-term economies at the expense of quality.
years ago, i encountered an assistant professor from a prestigious university who reported that the only way for faculty or students to really make contact (before email was invented) with one of the superstars on the faculty was through written memos even though that superstar was located two doors down the hall.
“the leadership of universities has been trying to understand exactly how [online education] fits into their strategic plans, and what this shows is that faculty are ahead of the institutions in these online goals.”
in fact, i maintain messages of selected "daring professor" who are willing to take chances in adverse environments.
in the traditional classroom a professor can easily detect if a person is cheating on their test, but how can they monitor that if someone is taking a test by way of a computer?
also, online formats can be fertile ground for professors who lack not only the desire to 'teach' but the ability and thus become mere administrators versus teachers.
asynchronous computer networks have the potential to improve contact with faculty, perhaps making self-paced learning a realizable goal for some off- and on-campus students.
i viewed the curriculum for regular students not part of the e&y program at http://www.commerce.virginia.edu/ms_accounting/requirements.htm .
these programs promise to be premier graduate experiences with customized and innovative curriculums.
i have been teaching my undergraduate course using asynchronous learning networks (aln) to enhance instruction.
- remember that it is usually more important to inspire students to want to learn than it is to have them learn technical content in any particular course.
we attribute this to the erroneous assumption that research rigor is excellence, a myth contradicted by the scientific method itself.
when asynchrounous courses are delivered off campus, library access becomes a major problem that is frequently ignored in the hype of aln promotion.
the introduction this academic year of a test that could be administered to both campus-based and distance-education students—the measure of academic proficiency and progress exam by the educational testing service—also made this kind of reporting possible, he said.
thus, a student may have learned to estimate the answer to a math problem before beginning calculations as a way of checking the accuracy of his answer, but in the chemistry lab, the same student calculates the components of a compound without noticing that his estimates sum to more than 100 percent.
bill wynne, mapp test product specialist, said that without knowing more about the makeup of the comparative samples and other information, he could not characterize the statistical significance of the gains the university was reporting, except that they were at least as good as those reported by the national cross section.
vendors having solid gold name recognition for quality will probably have a competitive advantage in distributing aln courses.
the unexpected huge cost arises from labor intensity of dealing with increased messaging of students in networked courses and the varying aln styles needed for differing types of students.
delivery will not be in the form of the dying synchronous distance education classes transmitted to remote sites by television.
among the study's findings was that "a shift to an entirely new funding model in the pure form of open access (author/producer pays) in which the costs of publishing research articles in journals are paid for by authors or a funding agency, and readers have access free online, is not currently a sustainable option for any of this group of journals based on the costs provided."
i like to force students to struggle on their own, because i think this prepares them for life after graduation.
so they look down at boys and say, 'they are small men, so they must be on the way to success,'" says pollack.
funding already received by cvu, including $250,000 from the alfred p. sloan foundation and $375,000 from corporate sponsorships, has already been spent, in part on developing the web site.
another way to reduce messaging costs is to invest more heavily in developing "intelligent" aln materials versus "one size fits all" materials.
i believe this intimacy results from a sense of shared control and esponsibility, commitment to collaboration and dialogue, and increased willingness to take risks in communications with others nline.
interactive multimedia and other technologies will change how we think about providers and whom we regard as providers.
the problem is exacerbated by computing technologies due to the ease of selecting all or part of a document and clicking on (edit, copy) and (edit, paste).
if you have audio on your computer, you can listen to mike kearl discuss what makes his "tail wag."
however, if high quality pedagogy is to be maintained, there are some significant costs that are being discovered in early experiences with asynchronous networked learning (aln).
to the extent that i am making discovery less difficult and more predictable, i might in fact be improving students' short term performance at the expense of long-term memory and cognition.
most certainly we do not put up a web counter and brag about the number of hits --- playboy probably gets more hits per day than all professors combined.
and to repeat what i said in the book, this does not mean a diminished role for teachers.
it appears that graduates from your m.s. in accounting program will not be able to sit for the cpa examination unless they take more accounting courses other than accounting courses you require in the program and as prerequisites for the program.
it seems very easy for someone to cheat in an asynchronous learning environment.
students need social interaction as vital component sof maturation and professional development.

distance learning technologies, such as the internet, and to a lesser extent, cable and satellite-based systems, enables learners to access education whenever and wherever they want.
but it's not statistics that have persuaded parents and educators that boys are in desperate straits, according to sara mead, a senior research fellow with the new america foundation, a public-policy institute.
the program is online in an asynchronous mode.
if done well, distance education tends to burn out instructors and takes an extraordinary amount of time relative to teaching onsite.

although many of us that teach in universities having some form of masters programs in accounting try to some extent to avoid having the cpa examination dictate our curricula, we generally do make it possible for our graduates to meet the minimum requirements to sit for the cpa examination in our own states and many other states.
the flip side of the coin is that the universities may sacrifice some of their independence in setting curricula and course contents since corporations paying for the education and training will dictate such matters to a large degree.

aln appears to be more like the old days where great teachers spent a lot of time with students outside of class.
in most cases, large group lectures are poorly presented, inadequately planned and almost completely lacking in challenges to the students.
in general, comparisons of onsite versus online test and grade performance will tend to show "no differences" among good students, because good students learn the material under varying circumstances.
and while it's a fact that boys and girls are both more likely to attend college than they were a generation ago, girls now make up well over half of the student body, and a projection by the department of education indicates that the gap will widen considerably over the next decade.
even universities that sell an aln course in one discipline may contract to purchase an aln course in another discipline.
the bottom line is that it is would not be reasonable for all five graduate courses each semester to take as much time as my courses.

the reason was not likely to be that online sections were easier.
also, online formats can be fertile ground for professors who lack not only the desire to 'teach' but the ability and thus become mere administrators versus teachers.
this contrasts with the bricks-and-mortar, campus-centric university of today; it even goes beyond the paradigm of the virtual university, which remains modeled on individual institutions.
jensen comment attrition rates are high because online students are often adults with heavy commitments to family and jobs.
there can be no instructor-option subjective factors when assigning grades, which means no changes in grade for effort and interpersonal relationships.

it is much easier to simply tick off the refereed hits (for when the binary scorer comes to write against your name, he writes only ones or zeros, to him the unread articles are all the same).
there is financial pressure too: colleges and universities must control and even reduce costs, as well as manage new competitive dynamics, while responding to growing demands.
however, the cost of "faculty" may not be significantly reduced for reasons discussed in this paper.
it is not clear that bam will work so well on lesser mortals.

if your book or journal editor objects to having your working documents published at your web site, remember who your master is at all times.
at this site, my favorite demonstration service is the mathematica surface modelling utilitiy at http://www.tisny.com/vrml/math.html - studio classrooms --- these were pioneered by rensselaer polytechnic institute's jack wilson at http://www.rpi.edu/dept/science/www/interactive_learning/classrooms.html large lecture halls are replaced by "studios" where pairs or small groups of students learn interactively on computers.
until the peer evaluation culture is changed, web publishing will not count heavily toward promotion, tenure, or take home pay.
other firms may have to join this band wagon just to compete for top students.
they get more feedback from students.
actually i usually do not assign pages to read, but in the process of studying assigned topics, my graduate students dig out a huge amount of material that they themselves feel they must study.
one of my students, katie greene, addresses this problem at http://www.resnet.trinity.edu/users/kgreene/distanceno.htm in the above document, katie provides links and references to literature on looming issues and "new roles for librarians."

the faculty learned, however, that every time a new technology was added, it experienced an increase in the level of effort necessary to support the student.
organizational and technological changes have forced companies to re-examine the way employees learn and what they learn.
(74% of the students who had high factor loadings on factor one were also classified as independent learners.
i sometimes think my "former" students know be better, via email, after graduation than while they were my students.
freeman predicted six months ago that many universities would become user-pays systems where for $1000, for example, students could use a bare minimum of the facilities, and pay $100 each for a menu of add-ons such as on-line self-study material, videos and discussion groups.

the customized online program is designed as a three-year course of study to be completed in parallel with the participants' full-time job responsibilities.
that will be a major bite not anticipated my many applicants.
the most successful use of aln thus presents itself as a combination of online courses and real classroom interaction.
(actually i still publish hard copy to maintain respectability, but i personally am far more proud of my "living" web research documents than my annual refereed "dead" hits over the past few years).

old hounds like me can opt for more tail wagging, but young pups need more nourishment shoved into the other end.
recent research indicates the entire online professional education industry may experience similar growth in 2005:
readers interested in asynchronous learning experiments may want to track the aln experiments at the university of illinois (under a $2.1 million sloan aln grant for 25 classes in varying disciplines as described athttp://ftp.cs.uiuc.edu/cs_info_server/alumni_info/newsletter/v1n6/sloan.html).

all students in the program take this graduate degree program online while continuing to work for pwc (mainly in the consulting division).
in total, more than 1,600 courses are available.
i assume that if they are terminated by e&y, their debt for the masters degree is waived.
i was impressed by the quality of this degree program and the tough standards of the program.
- you can play a greater part in developing and sharing learning materials with professors and students in foreign nations, notably underdeveloped nations.
some early studies of aln at other universities indicate that aln is more effective than traditional pedagogy.
they must study your web materials and make their own judgments regarding quality and relevance.
- other advantages are remote delivery of cost-efficient and conveniently distributed "virtual" courses.
i cannot even find a web site discussing the pwc mba program at the pwc web site.
if they leave, they will need to reimburse e&y for the pro-rated cost of the program.
later there is a coming-out session at the university where the students show their real identities, often to surprise and applause.
but this process is more anecdotal than the genuine blind refereeing process.

advantages include the following and are elaborated for computer aided learning (cal) athttp://www.trinity.edu/~rjensen/245ch02.htm#advantages4: - the main advantages of asynchronous cal are that student learning is self-paced and interactive.
at the other extreme we have the dregs of the tenured faculty assigned to the distance education division.
educators have long noted that school attendance and even academic success are no guarantee that a student will graduate an effective thinker in all situations.
that curriculum is a much more traditional master of accountancy curriculum than the above notre dame curriculum.
recently, president obama remarked, “i think there’s a possibility that online education can provide, especially for people who are already in the workforce and want to retrain, the chance to upgrade their skills without having to quit their job.”
however, this may also spread technician talent so thin across the campus that the risk of poor performance in some divisions may be increased.
studies have shown that messaging explodes exponentially if asynchronous network courses are to maximize learning effectiveness.

since you only offer 10 undergraduate credts of undergradutate accounting content, i do not see how it will be possible for graduates of your program to meet the requirements to take the cpa examination in states like texas.
the university's leaders say the findings show that its educational model is effective in helping students succeed in college, especially those who are underprepared.
ernst & young (e&y) has a funded customized program leading to an masters of accounting degree from the the university of notre dame or the university of virginia.
that doesn't make him unusual; in fact, in many ways, he couldn't be more typical.

computer-aided training may either enhance or detract from long-term performance.
to stem the flood, typical options currently available at most corporate web sites are only to fill out standardized forms (that computers can process) and/or to limit email messaging to webmasters with suggestions for improving the web site.
many universities will probably take on some form of the first scenario on page 30 that reads as follows (emphasis added): a traditional institution (college or university) can move selectively to offer online versions of existing courses and degree programs.
an example of a student's experience at taking an online course is provided bycyberschool at http://cyberschool.4j.lane.edu/about/csclass/csclass.html.
he handles one of the 3 scheduled nights of office hours, works on the homework sets (either he writes them and i review them or vice versa), and he grades the three excel projects after i run them through a grading macro.
the online pedagogy tended to have no effect on d and f students ---  http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/255wp.htm#illinois listen to dan stone’s audio about the scale experiments ---  http://www.cs.trinity.edu/~rjensen/000cpe/00start.htm but keep in mind that in the scale experiments, the same instructor of a course was grading both the online and onsite sections of the same course.
if taking the cpa is important to such a graduate and passing it is important for career advancement in e&y, the non-accounting graduate from notre dame will have to take more accounting courses just to sit for the cpa examination unless he or she can sit for the examination in some state that has less explicit application requirements than texas.

i use gizmos to support traditional instruction, but i have no desire to give up the classroom.
yes but the e&y funded masters degree is a fringe benefit not being offered by any other firm as part of the plan to recruit undergraduate students.
the number of companies using online learning to train employees will grow by 50 percent in 2005, according to bersin and associates.
it is terribly frustrating for faculty and students to repeatedly encounter hardware and software failures.
one example where asynchronous learning appears to achieve a good balance is the business activity model (bam) in intermediate accounting at themcintire school of commerce at the university of virginia.
the messages about boys, however, were easier to miss, in part because they're so ubiquitous.
sometimes students have to wait outside our offices, and being human, they conclude that they have better things to do with their time --- such as seeking out a teaching assistant or another student in the class.
- videotape --- this is still cheaper than storage and transmission of high volumes of digitized video, although random access, searching, and freezing on frames are huge limitations.
networks and networked information will lead to disintermediation, disaggregation, diffusion, and differentiation.
some examples include: viva the virtual library of virginia - electronic collections of books, journals, newspapers , as well as internet searches.
although no virtual library is going to contain the text of all books and journals in a major academic library due to copyright and impracticalities of digitizing trillions of pages of text and graphics, there are some collaborative efforts being made by various universities to aid students taking virutal courses off campus.
the debate is also a permanent and expandable record useful for future students.
now, just as an example of a colleague who has made some interesting advances in using networked technologies to move from pedagogy more towards androgogy here is a write-up on mark freeman at university of technology, sydney that was recently posted to ateach-l by andrew priest.
studies have shown that messaging explodes exponentially if asynchronous network courses are to maximize learning effectiveness.
the danger today is that asynchronous learning-along with other forms of "distance education"-will remain in the labs and in the hands of techno-educators-who seldom represent mainstream faculty interests.
this will not eliminate discourse and other messaging costs, but it may take some of the drudgery out of messaging.
i was impressed by the quality of this degree program and the tough standards of the program.
one problem with web publishing is that if you submit your stuff to a top journal, the editor wants you to hide your research from the world until the journal gets around to publishing your work (which in a recent case took five years "in press" for an accepted jensen and sandlin article to finally get published).
given the extra work, more than 60 percent of faculty see inadequate compensation as a barrier to the further development of online courses.
so we are interested in what impact aln will have on outcomes such as time-to-degree and student retention.
one of freemans examples of "new learning" is an on-line role-playing exercise this year for post-graduate students of securities markets law.
regards andrew priest mass lectures, often repeated, are the usual way that university business courses cope with cost pressures and student loads.
demand for online courses will almost double in 2005, as professionals and companies realize e-learning's distinct advantages, according to officials at redvector.com, a tampa-based company that offers online courses to professionals involved in the design and construction industries.
(6) there will be no undergraduate accounting material covered in the 30 credit hour degree program.
with deep knowledge, thinking can penetrate beyond surface structure
in other words, it's not genuine concern for boys that's energizing the movement but rather fear of girls surpassing them.
the number one thing that leads to great cases is access to information inside a corporation or not-for-profit organization.
networked courses may thus be synchronous and asynchronous, although the technical learning components are largely asynchronous.
yet as technology practice creates, technology theory is if anything becoming even more conforming and less relevant.
the gemba program at duke university stresses increased rather than decreased communications between faculty and students and between students themselves via newer technologies for global online communication.
i apologize for jumping to the conclusion that you were trying to offer a curriculum that enables students to sit for the cpa examination in virtually all states.
the main drawback of email is that responding to email communication is labor intensive (humans still answer the messages) and there are no volume controls other than refusals to answer all or certain types of email messaging.
however, i cannot imagine business majors having only one or two basic accounting courses entering that uva curriculum without taking intermediate accounting and some other prerequisite accounting modules.
as barry rice says, the traditional classroom may be a dinosaur in need of extinction.
indeed many of them are mainly synchronous learning network (sln) courses with small amounts of asynchronous aln material.
those infamous "fraternity files" have never been so rich as they will become with speech recognition technologies.
in another test, involving a smaller pool of students, the phoenix students' "information literacy" skills for such tasks as evaluating sources and understanding economic, legal, and social issues were also comparable to or significantly higher than the mean scores in several categories.
it might be noted that unlike the e&y and pwc programs, all universities have a chance of receiving funding for the new kpmg program that funds a masters of taxation degree for employess in the tax division.
metacognition table of contents my own experience is with a three-semester experiment of a non-majors "survey" course.
i’m sure that if the u.s. department of education had published a report showing that students in online learning environments performedworse, there would have been a major outcry in higher education with calls to shut down distance-learning programs and close virtual campuses.
a portion of one of my recent email messages is quoted below: the mere fact that many aln courses are shown to improve grades and/or the rate at which learning takes place does not imply that long-term performance has been enhanced.
however, i would argue that electronic communications are sometimes "closer."
it is these first globals, he writes, who are shaping what he says is nothing short of a "fundamental reorientation of the american character away from wanton consumption and toward a new global citizenry in an age of limited resources.

inon the horizon, may/june 1997, james morrison contends that by the year 1004 leading-edge educational institutions will use competency-based certification multimedia learning modules and virual learning environments.
one wonders how top programs such as the duke university global executive mba program and the ohio university online mba without boundries program manage to provide library resources to students.
to my knowledge, other universities were not even given a chance to bid on this program.
the story correctly notes that online learning enables more “learning by doing,” which many students find more engaging and useful.
if the first round of books was focused on the classroom, the second round observes the boy in his natural habitat.
i covered a little less material than in the traditional course.
for example, a motivated student could progress more rapidly toward a degree.

i do not use the student names, but as the semester goes on they try to figure out what will get captured in the summary of the week.
“knowing that one should think critically is not the same as being able to do so.
i just finished reading a couple archive articles on online teaching from the chronicle of higher education, one write who hated online teaching and another who loved it.
there is also a sense that we are innovators and early adopters who "crossed over" early in the technology transfer and diffusion process.[11] in the fielding culture, this pioneer experience has come to be known as riding the waves, or embracing the "turbulence" of rough seas - a metaphor for global and organizational unrest as well.
however, if high quality pedagogy is to be maintained, there are some significant costs that are being discovered in early experiences with asynchronous networked learning (aln).

ways to avoid the disadvantages of asynchronous modules and courses are listed below for computer aided learning (cal) and elaborated upon in greater detail athttp://www.trinity.edu/~rjensen/245ch02.htm#ways2 - try to resist temptations to dehumanize some courses by eliminating face-to-face encounters.
the masters in accounting degree is free in the sense that e&y pays a salary plus providing funding for all tuition, fees, room, board, and travel costs.
at the time the survey was administered, there were more professors with at least 20 years’ experience teaching an online course than professors with five years’ experience or less.
in a new book by mr. zogby released today, he said that polls show a sharp increase in acceptance of online education in the past year.
constant access: the internet is open 24/7, so students can share ideas and “sit in class” whenever they have time or when an idea strikes -- whether it be the dead of night or during lunch.
the real promise of online education is providing learning experiences that are more tailored to individual students than is possible in classrooms.
also there are opportunities to cheat (ill lavishly praise your work if you will adore mine in a succession of email messages), but most scholars have more integrity than to organize that sort of conspiracy.
most likely, the cost of an imported course will be less than cranking up a traditional or aln course on campus.
few, if any, campuses have budgets to provide backup systems for disruptions of service.
the program is very selective and students pay a hefty fee.
assessment was very difficult.
the results show that in reading, critical thinking, and writing, its freshmen scored below those of the population over all, but the difference between those scores and those of its seniors was greater than for the population at large.
this is a highly competitive program and we expect to recruit the best business school candidates.
firstly, students admitted to these programs were top undergraduate students majoring in very difficult concentrations.
degerhan usleul, the chief operating officer of interactive learning international corporation (ilinc), is quoted as saying: the importance of an instructor's physical presence, complete with body language, as well as the rapport one builds with classmates, are not easily replaced.

inon the horizon, may/june 1997, james morrison contends that by the year 1004 leading-edge educational institutions will use competency-based certification multimedia learning modules and virual learning environments.
once these courses are networked on a given campus, it becomes profitable to distribute aln courses to other universities.
their time would be freed up to give extremely valuable one-on-one teaching.
distribution was achieved by using student scores on previous exams plus their verbal sat scores.
however, the cost of "faculty" may not be significantly reduced for reasons discussed in this paper.
i believe the reason that the recent study elicited so little commentary is due to the fact that it flies in the face of the biases held by some across the higher education landscape.
robert c. heterick, jr. the three rs fathom users will have the opportunity to interact and collaborate with the leading experts in their field.
in an effort to avoid burn out, much of the learning effectiveness is lost.

an example of the network learning features of mooville is by conlon as follows: when an instructor assigned a short play for students to read, instead of discussing it by talking face to face with each other, each group of students would go to its workspace in mooville and conduct their discussions online.
the major five-year, multimillion dollar study that first caught my eye was the scale experiments on the campus of the university of illinois where 30 courses from various disciplines were examined over a five year experiment.
the storage time of an individual's knowledge from acquisition to use has shrunk because employees must use the latest knowledge available to keep companies at the edge of the competition.
faculty clinging to traditional lectures and classroom case discussions may not even be aware that whatever went on in their classrooms is now available at hidden sites on the web at either a public or a private web site.
teaching assistants had to be hired to assist faculty in dealing with the huge and somewhat unexpected volume of student messaging.

withthe chronicle show that the 32-year-old, open-access institution is fulfilling its goals.
potential advantages of aln in existing courses are so monumental that most campuses are experimenting with aln at the moment and contemplating more widespread deployment for existing courses.
in fact, it constitutes a minority of total facilitated information flow in a college classroom.
of course, organizations with less brand recognition may offer selected aln courses of outstanding quality.
the students in the experiment were full time on campus students, such that the confounding problems of having adult part-time students was not a factor in the scale experiments of online, asynchronous learning.
the internet expands learning opportunities.
but the push for accountability isn't coming just from outside.
at the university of north texas where students can sometimes choose between an onsite or an online section of a course, some student just preferred to be able to take a course in their pajamas ---http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/255wp.htm#northtexas some off-campus students prefer to avoid the hassle and time consumed driving to campus and spending a huge amount of time searching for parking.
it is aimed at employees who probably were not even business majors.

"when you look at the programs that had more than 20 people sit for the exam, baylor leads the pack with a combined average 65.3% pass rate across the test sections," said terry maness, dean of baylor's hankamer school of business.
technology enables us to disaggregate the place, the content, the delivery, and judgments about the quality of education.
the mcgraw-hill giant publishing conglomerate has launched its online mcgraw-hill world university described at http://www.mhcec.com/. before long mhwu intends to network fully accredited degree programs in higher education.
labor costs are enormous for having humans read and respond to email messages.
a factor in aln use is hardware, software, and instructor abilities to handle aln.
the results of the students' performance were put through statistical analysis and the null hypothesis was rejected for the cd/film and cd/text groups.
the summary highlights and links can be found at http://www.trinity.edu/~rjensen/255light.htm the course has some highly innovative features including the online participation of accounting standard setting bodies in the various countries mentioned above.
student reaction was strong and about equally divided between those who loved it and those who hated it.
we especially need to add elective courses in specialized areas.
in a situation such as that at stanford, where classes are taught live and are also televised, asynchronous delivery is a direct cost overlay.
conversion of normal conversations greatly facilitates storage, search, and random access retrieval of all or portions of such conversations.
“as a faculty member, when you’re teaching online, suddenly you have to be teaching 24/7,” said samuel smith, president emeritus of washington state university.
in team debates, groups take positions on issues such as corporate law reform, and hone their responses in private conferences before posting them on the internet.
i also have boards that are dedicated to the content modules, the homework (quizzes), projects, and exams.
the verbal and writing-intensive nature of the text-based forum network also forces one to make ones thoughts very explicit whenever possible; there is little room for subtlety.

when the military develops icbt, the material contains artificial intelligence utilities that adapt to the background, aptitude, and motivation of the learner.
the authors of today's aplu study conclude by recommending that public universities not only institute policies that “acknowledge and recognize” professors’ online education efforts, but also work develop “mechanisms that effectively incorporate online learning into the fabric and missions of the institutions.”
in particular, he and his colleagues attempted a method in which professors record comments on students’ written assignments, which students can then listen to as they read along at corresponding points in the text.
- you may discover that new technology can lead to more cross-discipline research and applications.
if institutions own the software, however, students can listen to the audio (and record their own additions) on the free and commonly used acrobat reader.

student frustrations center around not having enough lab computers, wasting time on lab computers that fail, having their own computers crash during the semester, and encountering network crashes or delays due to clogged bandwidth.
that familiarity can come from long-term, repeated experience with one problem, or with various manifestations of one type of problem (i.e., many problems that have different surface structures, but the same deep structure).
services might include "assessments, educational counseling, administrative process such as registration, technical support, study skills assistance, career counseling, library services, students' rights and responsibilities, and governance."
this seems to be less of a problem with email, and when it happens i just send out correction/addendum messages.

it is too soon to predict when and how fast accredited programs will be online, but traditional colleges and universities are not waiting for the business world to take over market shares.
pollack concedes, as mead and others point out, that poor performance in school is also tied to factors like race and class, but he insists that boys as a group—including white, middle-class boys—are sinking, pointing to studies that suggest they are less likely to do their homework and more likely to drop out of high school.
for some, that might mean that their online work should figure into tenure and promotion decisions.
his polling also points to other challenges that colleges will face as they race to serve a worldwise generation of 18-to-29-year-olds that mr. zogby calls "first globals."

introduction before reading this, you should read about asynchronous learning at  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asynchronous_learning some futurists predict that our physical campuses will decay and crumble as higher education alternatives explode on the web.
read about when one of the chronicle’s senior editors took a governmental accounting course at the university of phoenix during which the instructor of the course had not idea thatgoldie blumenstyk was assessing how difficult or how easy the course was for students in general.
brown thinks boys are more complicated, and less single-minded, than adults give them credit for.
most of our campuses will thrive and prosperif we learn how to bridge our curriculum gaps with the web and still maintain some of the best of what we traditionally accomplish in classes and other face-to-face encounters with our students.
but kaplan above ignores some of the dark side aspects of distance education and education technology in general --- http://www.trinity.edu/rjensen/000aaa/theworry.htm the biggest hurdle, in my opinion, is that if distance education is done correctly with intensive online communications, instructors soon become burned out.
by "pricey" the article means that the tuition alone is $82,500 for this online combination of synchronous and aln modules.
the conclusion: “students who took all or part of their class online performed better, on average, than those taking the same course through traditional face-to-face instruction.”
the university of phoenix has been good at attracting some top professionals.
the only time they actually met offline was for a two day orientation at the drexell campus and after that it was totally online.
boys, he says, tend to communicate through action.

the course is very interactive.
the mba program curriculum will consist of twenty courses structured to meld individual student goals with the organizational needs of deere & company.
asynchronous computer networks have the potential to improve contact with faculty, perhaps making self-paced learning a realizable goal for some off- and on-campus students.
(chronicle of higher education 2 apr 99) ideally, faculty or other expert help is available online to both help students and evaluate student work and ideas.
be that as it may, there are repeated reports of successes of sdl in both reduced cost and improved performance in training.
results show that network (distributed education) courses will be labor intensive in terms of dealing with student messaging and evaluation of student work.
to help online students cope with this burden, a blog sponsored by western governors university offers survival tips.
- chat lines --- these are actually technologies for supplementing asynchronous messaging (like email and the internet) with synchronous messaging where students and faculty are assembled at the same point in time from various parts of the world to have synchronized communications.
hence, students are not all studying the same materials, and it becomes more difficult to lean on each other for help crossing troubled waters.
nevertheless it does suffer from some of the controversies such as the role it plays in admission of students, its role in setting workloads of employees who are working while taking the customized program, and the use of faculty and facilities that are heavily subsidized by taxpayers if the participating university is state supported.
(taken fromdangers of global education) - students loose out by not actually reading published books.
about the only time saved is the logistical time waster of commuting to and from a classroom site.
the scale experiments collected a lot of data pointing to more intense communications with instructors and more efficient use of student’s time that is often wasted in going to classes.
the average cost per hour for delivering the traditional classroom instruction was $13.34, while the average for delivering the self-directed material was $7.76.it is interesting to note that the results of the learning indicate the self-direct approach proved as good as, or better than, the traditional learning method.
projects and case studies are used to link relational topics in each of the five subject areas.
corporate university programs will increasingly compete with traditional universities for entire degree programs.
athttp://www.resnet.trinity.edu/users/eeudy/aln.htm she writes the following: although it is too far fetched to say that we will turn into cold, heartless robots as a result of aln and that our society has become irrevocably orwellian, the lack of face-to-face social interaction could potentially do more harm than good in our education.
with its emphasis on creativity and competition, this marketplace will enable a wide range of players -- universities, media, publishers, content specialists, technology companies -- to market, sell, and deliver educational services online.
in our case, it was important for us to have a curriculum that was exactly consistent with the requirements for our existing m.s.in accountancy degree program.
significant statistical difference was demonstrated in favor of interactive multimedia.
interestingly, many faculty members choose to teach online because they want more student interaction.
august 28, 2009 reply from bob jensen one of the most successful distance education programs in the world, in my viewpoint, is the masters degree program headquartered in vancouver called the chartered accountancy school of business ---http://www.casb.com/
or, it may be that this medium disinhibits student communication, thereby stimulating the message exchange process.
and in a comparison of students who enter college with "risk factors" that often contribute to their dropping out, phoenix's rates of completion for a bachelor's degree were substantially higher than for institutions over all.
students are apt to be more attentive to newer technologies simply because they are "new" curiosities.
the program is often specialized calendar, courses, and mode of delivery.
students will be more likely to select educational institutions based on offerings, convenience, and price than on geography.
it is designed to create value for our enterprise and allow us to attract and retain high-quality employees,'' said nate jones, chief financial officer at deere & company.
if done poorly, the culprit is most likely the tendency to assign part-time or otherwise non-tenured instructors to the distance education courses.
a message from tom frecka director, m.s. in accountancy programs, university of notre dame bob jensen's reply comments are in red.
we surveyed our faculty to find out why attendance had declined at our on-campus technology conference (scheduled during a day when classes were not in session).
- both better student performance and higher evaluations of instructors can result.
in double blind studies of the impact of technologies upon learning, hawthorne effects are particularly troublesome.
several faculty at drexel university who participated in a sloan aln grant warn that: institutions as a whole must also be committed to aln-based education and training.

i think it’s very rewarding to look at grading in formal studies using the same full-time faculty teaching sections of online versus onsite students.
since most new hires hope to stay with a large public accounting firm for at least three years, the three year indenture is no big deal.
in defining the word 'teaching', i think many people overemphasize the last transition that i mentioned, thinking that the primary movement of information is from them(the teacher) to the students.
bob jensen the one thing to keep in mind is that there is no one pedagogy that is best in all circumstances.
how easy it becomes to beat the speaker in putting that speaker's presentation into printed text.
eight years ago the accounting faculty at baylor university tore down the stovepipes between traditional accounting core classes (financial accounting, managerial accounting, taxation, accounting information systems, and auditing) to achieve integrated coverage across a three-semester sequence.
according to the study, professors are open to teaching online courses (defined in the study as courses where at least 80 percent of the course is administered on the web), but do not believe they are receiving adequate support from their bosses.
the internet lowers the threshold of entry to the higher education marketplace for new commercial and nonprofit educational providers by eliminating many barriers.
in the book, mr. zogby also highlights the emerging influence of the first globals, whom his book calls "the most outward-looking and accepting generation in american history."
in the end, i concluded their was little for me to like about this mode of instruction.
yet as technology practice creates, technology theory is if anything becoming even more conforming and less relevant.
some conditions are easily met with existing technologies such as timing the examination and webcams and microphones that allow the examiners to view and hear the student from most any distance around the world.
``graduates of this program will learn skills that help them better meet the challenges of improving business performance and delivering value to shareholders.''
- bulletin board system (bbs) - the electronic version of a cork board with tacked messages.
i even like the messages that signal items to be corrected --- at least those users found my stuff worth correcting.
the change in mental process has been brought about because "(1) information is freely available, and therefore interdisciplinary ideas and cross-cultural communication are widely accessible; (2) time is compressed, and therefore reflection is condensed and decision-making is compacted; (3) individuals are empowered, and therefore private choice and reach are strengthened and one person can have the presence of an institution" (sec: concluding remarks).
although dell corporation has over $2 million in sales per day from web site order forms, a message sent to the only email address provided at the dell web site reads as follows: please note, the webmaster@dell.com address is for communications regarding this website only.

about the only thing she hadn't done, it seemed, was to take a course from an online university.
and while it may be true that microbrews and zipcars, at least, are still very much niche products, mr. zogby says they are signs of transcendent change—just like the distance-education courses that are being offered by more and more institutions across the country.
this is unfortunate because even though there is no standard formula for writing effective cases there are certain guidelines which i believe consistently lead to better cases.
i presume that many students will not want to incur this liability.
some advocates of aln having great successes with aln on campus may not have the same success with modem users.
cost, efficiency and ease of use have no equals to email and the internet.
if organizations regard the technology as a fad or as something in which they must become involved because of perceived competition, then they will not sustain alns as part of the primary delivery processes.
"technology in teaching can operate like an unguided missile unless the goals are well specified, such as changing student understanding," he says.
what seemed impossible to me were the following points that i concluded immediately after reading the packet of materials being sent to universities to distribute to undergraduate students and the information at the e&y web site on "the master plan" athttp://www.ey.com/careers/masters/default.asp the fact that the masters degrees are designated as accounting degrees and that the capstone course is the cpa review course, leads students and people like me into believing that these degrees enable graduates from the e&y program to sit for the cpa examination.
there are people that i hate to interrupt with a telephone call, but i am rarely embarrassed to send them email messages.
that was way more than you wanted to know, but i get carried away when i talk about online teaching.

note that corporations can limit 800-number phone messaging by simply setting the capacity for incoming telephone calls such that, when all lines are busy, the public must wait for an open phone line.
alfred p. sloan foundation's program in learning outside the classroom at http://w3.scale.uiuc.edu/scale/ it may well be that some of our universities will decide that their comparative advantage lies in operating highly personal, mediated, residential teaching experiences.
positive results on learning impacts may not be sustaining, however, after the novelty and curiosity factors decline with repeated use of the technology over time.
examples of real audio application in courses along with the use of other aln tools can be found in the power point slides at http://www.online.uillinois.edu/oakley/presentations/uiuc_als_links.html you can download a version of realplayer from http://www.real.com/ as an illustration, paul krause's streaming video accounting information systems lectures are linked and explained at http://www.trinity.edu/~rjensen/ideasmes.htm#krause one of the more innovative applications of real audio online is in beth ingram's macro economics course at the university of iowa.

one of my students, elizabeth eudy, wrote the following at http://www.resnet.trinity.edu/users/eeudy/aln.htm i may be mistaken in the specific case, but the person in reykjavik, iceland who owns the domain name carnegiemellon.com seems well positioned to offer services in a way that just might be confused with services offered by a well known u.s. university.
"these results demonstrate the quality of our program," said dr. charles davis, chair of the accounting & business law department.
the university of phoenix has been good at attracting some top professionals.
ok, we do have research tutorials (e.g. at the aaa annual meeting), but they are relatively rare.

marilyn is a management professor (university of missouri in kansas city) who has been very active in the north american case research association.
i videotaped the presentation by professor lightner and nadig and will now share my summary of the highlights of this innovative international accounting course.
in addition, asynchronous courses may schedule synchronous virtual online meetings of subsets of students or entire classes of students.
in 1995, 1,920 learning plans were completed, resulting in 4,080 self-study hours, or 40% of the total course offerings.
one reason is that educational institutions have thrived on regional monopolies and/or the halo of hallowed tradition.
at their workstations, students had to type in their ideas for other group members to read and respond to; they also had to respond in return.
the third scenario is to become a "mega" university aggressively marketing world wide online degree programs.
this was the case even in an "asynchronous" environment where i had the flexibility to conduct electronic office hours in my bathrobe over morning coffee or post feedback in the dead of night.
research is much, much more like the real work world that our graduates will experience than the f2f classroom.
these days, he said, students are much more likely to have experienced other cultures firsthand, either as tourists or because they have immigrated from someplace else.
in the first week the students describe their roles; then crises are provided, such as a currency slump, bank failure or misleading prospectus for a privatisation.
asynchronous courses are also more demanding on materials development.
two graders were trained and achieved more than 90 percent in grader variabilility.
walmart, for example, naively installed a customer email answering service only to discover that the flow of message become a roaring stream that was overwhelming.
but without conscious, concerted effort, the results will be a continuation of today's inadequate, piecemeal solutions.
i think goldie’s audio report of her experience is still available from thechronicle of higher education.
what seems to be more of a problem with asynchronous courses seems to be faculty burn out that, in large measure, is caused by increased communications with students.
thursdays are my toughest days because i am frequently on until 11 or 11:30.
"our grads have consistently earned the distinction of being in the list of top ten scorers on the cpa exam historically.

when she does find the time, however, i'm in for big trouble.
for example, i consider it shame when someone other than a major university uses a domain name of that university.
belatedly, it now appears to me that graduates from the e&y program will not be allowed to sit for the cpa examination in texas and some other states unless they take nearly an extra year of accounting coursework before or after completing the masters in accounting degree program funded by e&y.
the majority of participants ... expressed the view that it was easier to express themselves at a higher cognitive level when they could present material using multiple media sources.”
- research on effectiveness of cal is often futile due to the pace of technological change, the variation in learning ingredients, and hawthorne effects.
he catches flak for supposedly overinterpreting neuroscience data to comport with his theories about boys.
excess rigor supports the demands of appointment, grant and promotion committees, but is drying up the wells of academic inspiration."
problem 2: students, especially undergraduate students, cannot have a complete learning experience without being physically present on a campus.
many of those networked courses will have such prestige "brand names" of stanford university, mit, harvard university, princeton university, northwestern university, university of michigan, university of texas, university of illinois, etc.
- due to the large number of students taking aln courses and their tendency to contact professors frequently, more professors or teaching assistants are required to adequately teach a cyber course.
the following quotation from a high-level massachusetts institute of technology evat committee report says it all in terms of why top universities will offer networked courses and programs.
there could be many reasons for this, but, especially in light of the u.s. department of education study, it seems that online learning has contributed meaningfully to their becoming better teachers.

where networked technology can assist us is to change the teaching and learning model from sage/pupil towards research leader/co-researcher.
in reviving ophelia, mary pipher bemoaned a "girl-poisoning" culture that emphasized sexiness above all else.
so we are interested in what impact aln will have on outcomes such as time-to-degree and student retention.
there have been some studies (one was reported in playboy) showing that husbands and wives that see each other every day have a surprisingly small amount of genuine communication except at certain peak moments such as when they are in a car together on a long trip or awaiting a meal by candlelight in a slow-service restaurant.
ultimately, the university made available a course management system, which significantly streamlined the effort on the part of faculty to make course materials available to the student.
- real and psuedo audio/video --- these are huge innovations for aln.
unfortunately, online formats do allow certain professors to hide behind the electronic cloak and politely excuse themselves from the equation, which greatly hurts the student.
``our faculty's talent in educational innovation enables us to create close relationships with the corporate community and construct programs according to their specific criteria.

they might study a certain subset of boys, but boys per se were off the table.
it’s more apparent when a student is falling behind and needs special attention.
my assumption is that full-time faculty compensation is comparable regardless of whether they teach on- or "off-" line

bob jensen's other documents glossaries education chapter 2 metacognition table of contents the myth of lower faculty cost: network bridges may be cheap shots or very costly to deliver i indicated above that my colleagues are skeptical about contracting for any networked aln courses even though some courses would greatly improve the curriculum at trinity university.
traditional distance learning formats are said to be plagued with this problem.[9] not so, in my experience with the interactive digital classroom.
among reasons for why they were not using technology in their work, they cited lack of the following: training, support, space, equipment, and knowledge of what was available and how items could be obtained.
admittedly, i jumped to some erroneous conclusions prior to learning more about the e&y master plan curriculum.
for example, there are times when i feel a bit intimidated myself in the presence of some people that i communicate freely with by email.
but that’s because of my wants, not because i think it is a more effective way to teach.
in the sloan foundation funded aln courses, it was discovered that students normally reluctant to communicate in traditional classrooms and faculty offices suddenly want to write vast amounts in writing assignments and other messages in the illinois aln experimental courses.
many conceal email addresses of employees.
faculty members occasionally miss class due to illness or scheduling conflicts, but faculty miss class much less often than computers crash on most campuses.
in many ways, i know my online students better and many stay in touch.
producing good aln materials entails significant training of faculty and reconsideration of reward structures for learning materials development of college faculty.
for others, “acknowledgment” might equate to some extra cash in their paycheck.
an enormous problem for universities who engage more and more in aln courses that rely daily upon networking systems is to keep those systems efficient and reliable for students.
in addition, nearly 64 percent of faculty said it takes 'somewhat more' or 'a lot more' effort to teach online compared to a face-to-face course.
our experience shows that the production and delivery costs of adequate quality multimedia content are high.
educators have long noted that school attendance and even academic success are no guarantee that a student will graduate an effective thinker in all situations.
students are already exercising their consumer rights and demanding "just-in-time" learning, rather than conforming to university teaching schedules.

kelley's senior faculty designed the program specifically for john deere, with input from the deere finance division's senior management team.
my role in the classroom is making it easier for information to move from one place to another - from point a to point b. this could be from textbook to student, it could be from the outside world to the student, from another student to the student, from the student him or herself to that same student and from teacher to student (me to them).

equipping divisions (e.g., a college of business within the university) with their own servers, labs, and computing maintenance centers reduces the risks of university-wide computer system failure, but the cost becomes enormous in terms of hardware and personnel costs.
the news isn't good here, either.
for example, where i might put approximately 36 hours of work per week routinely into a regular course load with a total of 120 students in four traditional class sections at a large public university, online instruction at fielding required 50 hours or more per week - with only 24 students in just three sections of my digital classes.
the factor that will close that "enthusiasm gap" is the growing use of distance education by well-respected universities, mr. zogby predicts in the book,the way we'll be: the zogby report on the transformation of the american dream(random house).
with online courses, companies no longer have to pay travel and hotel costs and employees can be more productive since they aren't spending time traveling.
as the u.s. department of education study concluded, online education can do that and much more.
in theory, then, collaborations using web-based editing tools can potentially boost understanding, at least visually.
the program helps the companies to eliminate the some costs and uncertainties of trying to hire full-qualified employees from major universities and also the time lost when employees have to go to these classes during normal working hours.
among the study's findings was that "a shift to an entirely new funding model in the pure form of open access (author/producer pays) in which the costs of publishing research articles in journals are paid for by authors or a funding agency, and readers have access free online, is not currently a sustainable option for any of this group of journals based on the costs provided."
the second scenario, according to dr. graves, is to become a "meta" university like the university of utah that is retaining its traditional market niche while exporting several networked courses to the new online western governors university.
ask a representative of the aauw about a pitfall that appears to disproportionately affect boys, like attention-deficit disorder, and the representative will counter that the disparity is overplayed or that girls deal with equally troubling issues.
also, some of our traditional courses perhaps should no longer meet in regularly scheduled class periods even if these courses are only made available to resident students.
but mr. zogby writes that polling by his organization shows that attitudes about online education are changing fast.
my ta was one of my top students, and he applied to become my ta after he earned his msa.
