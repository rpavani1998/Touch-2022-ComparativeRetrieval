a traditional class presents students with opportunities for real-time discussion, lectures from which notes can be taken, and an opportunity for immediate feedback from the instructor.particularly for adult learners, working professionals, or undergraduate students with other obligations competing for their time, online courses allow the disciplined student to manage competing obligations and go to class when they have the time to focus their attention on their work.a traditional class sometimes makes it possible for a student to avoid doing assigned reading, or at least makes it possible for certain learners to obtain the information they need from lecture slides and classroom discussions.while research seems to suggest that the optimal combination for learning is a "hybrid" environment involving both online and brick-and-mortar components in the same class, other research suggests that online learning can be as effective as the traditional classroom experience.this means students will need to read materials completely, participate in online activities and assessments, and actively seek-out alternative sources for supplemental information.online courses do not provide the immediate feedback you get in a traditional classroom setting.while there are no absolutes in the world of student learning (since we all learn differently!), experience tells us that online courses can both be more challenging than a traditional course and require a different kind of engagement than what you might need in a regular class.you will find that the best online courses use other interactive tools - not just discussion boards - to build community and create a good conversation.thus, in an online environment, learning requires an added level of personal discipline.most instructors will expect students in an online environment to take responsibility for familiarizing themselves with the content of the course.many courses will involve small writing assignments, such as journal entries or blogs, to keep you on task and help the instructor evaluate whether or not you are understanding the material.where you might be able to remain silent in a traditional classroom and rely on others to ask the questions you really need the answers to, you cannot always count on that happening in an online course.some studies even suggest that online learning may have an edge withsome learners.an online course is typically (though not always)"asynchronous," meaning one can log on to the class at their convenience.online learning can be a great option.
