adults are no different than kids in our ability to learn except that we have this intellectual or emotional baggage that tells that we cant do something or that it is too difficult and not worth trying.language has a humbling effect and probably takes the same amount of time to learn as an adult as it does as a child.adults can achieve the same results but it takes time and hard work.adults are just more aware of all of the hard work it takes to learn a language.adults learning a foreign language think it is hard because they are more conscious of the effort they are exerting in order to gain this new skill and knowledge.im not sure that it is an easier for younger children to learn a foreign language but it does seem that the end result is a more fluid and natural speaker of the 2nd language.as adults we build up language learning too much in our minds as something hard or think it will be easy and then get discouraged when we dont speak fluently in 30 days.i often get asked by adult students if it is too late for them to learn a foreign language.even then they will be learning it for another 8-10 years depending on their education.kids just do it because it is part of their life.work that kids just saw as part of life and occured naturally for them in their daily activities.i think that part of the reason that we think that kids learn easier is because they dont remember how hard it was because it was just part of life.so do i think that it is easier for kids to learn a foreign language than adults.my response is always that anyone can learn a foreign language.but if you work hard you will learn the language.
