if an adult were put into the same situation as a child learning its first language (totally immersed, with multiple repetitions of new words, and no other major tasks to complete), they would develop new language skills much faster than children.it’s a widely-spread notion that children are much better than adults at picking up new languages, because their brains are easier to rewire, and they don’t have to learn consciously.adults are actually much better at learning and retaining language-related information than children, as arecent study has shown.adults were shown to have the best retention rate of this information following the original exposure.older children and adults can become conversational in a foreign language within a year, if they try hard enough.8-year-olds, 12-year-olds, and adults were shown a new rule in a made up language, although this rule was never stated explicitly.the difference is that kids don’t have to think about it so much.
