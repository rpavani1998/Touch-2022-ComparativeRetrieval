open source projects are a good way to market their skills and show off their coding abilities and ability to work in a team.in that way their open source developments pay off and they can finally earn an income for their hard work.in the end they want equal pay for equal work.it is basically forking off a closed source version and paying off developers to release it so they are finally paid for their hard work and years dedicated to writing code.we are hoping that we are good stewards of the mysql phenomenon, and we hope that you can come to terms with the fact that we find revenue generation a vital part of our mission.they not only open source this stuff but actively develop and maintain it and understand that being the first stop for support and services they provide (like online backup features in their enterprise tools) is the reward they receive for this generous gpling of their codebase.you get better quality faster, and you often get better innovation too.i wish them the best of luck, but i will make sure i do what is best for me and my clients.this is more like the adult teaching a kid about sharing by playing with a toy with the child.homepage journal of course open source licenses allow for some code and features to be released from the open source license by paying off the developers who developed the code and having them sign a contract.most of the time that doesn't happen and it continues to be unsupported and open source developers have friends and family members wondering if they are insane, doing all of that hard work for free and it looks like they are throwing away money or flushing it down the toilet.home wind-power turbines make headwayto get to this goal of ours, we believe we have to be more pragmatic than dogmatic.i'd like to see more people showing respect for a company that has done so much for open source and respect the fact that they deserve to actually make a little money along the way.the mysql server could not have evolved as much as it did (not that i am saying it has evolved perfectly) if we hadn't had a revenue stream to fund the hiring of developers and others.
