as many of you know, many of these tools have the potential to create dynamic learning environments where students interact with each other in new ways and with information and content in new ways.the more that kids are connect to each other, to adults, and to the school community, the more ways we can find to develop talent, the more environments for learning that we provide and support, both formal and informal, the better off our schools will be.we also have a responsibility to find ways to provide experiences for those that cannot afford these technologies at home.and they shouldn’t anyway, because most are far from having the organizational readiness required to plan for, implement, support, sustain, and evaluate any kind of program that places these technologies in a student’s hands.if you are an innovator, then you perhaps can be a leader in the change process that enlarges innovation, and that indeed, can potentially be considered a component of what constitutes excellence.much of that becomes internalized in how i do my job, and that translates directly in my ability to support classroom teachers with ideas on how to make learning come alive.that big building that looks like a school,is a school, can be a successful institution where much important learning takes place.having relationships with people that understand you, and support you, are required to be truly successful, but this only comes with honoring and understanding them first.a great deal of my time is spent managing our blackboard presence, which contains a suite of tools that give our teachers access to a number of tools that can drive learning.we have a responsibility to teach kids, and we should do so with everything at our disposal.but this lack of understanding is very real, and represents challenges to daily instruction, as well as policy regarding technology and teaching and learning.having a few freedoms like the commons area is only a part of that, and those freedoms provide an environment that enable kids to connect with other kids.sometimes they fail, but most often they succeed, however failure itself is seen as a success, and an adventure in the direction of learning, which in itself, is reward enough for these individuals.others may see these teachers as incredibly valuable-they can point to these teachers as examples of innovation in their buildings and models for their peers.talk about school reform in the blogosphere all you want, legislate it all you want, but in my opinion, change will result by people in the system rolling up their sleeves and getting it done, and basing that reform on sound educational theory, meaningful information about students and student progress, dedicated professional educators, and again, all supported by that shared, collective vision.
