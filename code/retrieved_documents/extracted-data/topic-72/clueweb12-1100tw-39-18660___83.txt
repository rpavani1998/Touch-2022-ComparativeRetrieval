she’s still in school and her parents give her some money to help her out, which is pretty common.
i live in a high-cost area and paid $250/week (and this was more than a decade ago, the cost in my area has probably grown 50-60% since then.)
reply i agree with you there — the cost really varies!
reply how much you spend can vary a lot, but i will say that definitely the cost goes up as the child grows.
something that caused me to spend a lot more on kids that i would have planned for is that i had twins.
cloth diapers saved a lot of money and i nursed exclusively until i moved them to table food (i made baby food for a very short period).
(when/if we have a second kid, that’s a different story.)
weeks they are here run about $200 in groceries, weeks they’re not run about $150.
he costs nearly $1,000/mo.
maybe that’s why kate wrote recently to ask a question that hadn’t ever occurred to me.

it sounds like you desperately need a better plan.
and you will likely be able to cash flow some.
on the plus side: they cut the lawn!
1- i don’t plan to have natural children.
and my interviews of home daycare providers versus the larger facilities showed me that home daycare providers provide the more personalized care (better in my book) that i was looking for, and don’t nickel and dime you for everything.
home daycare costs about half as much as the large daycare facilities.
toys – christmas & her birthday are close, so we spent about $200 between the two.
bottom line, i think it’s a crapshoot.
(unless they’re going to make a career out of dance, it really doesn’t matter much!)
if they don’t need it then it will just roll for your retirement.
i work from home, so childcare isn’t on our expenses.
she’s only average height, so it’s not really a problem, but somebody taller wouldn’t fit there.
it doesn’t quite make the full projected tuition at a private school, but there’s the chance dc will get merit scholarships, we’ll be living in a state with a good flagship, etc.
reply daycare costs when they were younger were about $800/month.
coupon for diapers and , most of all, love your child!
but it popped in my head and now i think i’m on to something!)
that worked up until they were about 8 to 10.
your $10k emergency fund is going to feel like a handful of pennies if you lose your job and you’ve got a child to support.
i’m not a history or sociology student, waltzing in for 3 hours of lectures a week.
and i miss work at least 1-2 times a week.
it can be very little with breastfeeding, cloth diapers, and hand-me-downs, but daycare is a killer.
i mostly made my own baby food.
(perhaps ordering online cuts that cost.
our little boy is turning 1 in a couple weeks, and i’m in the middle of writing a series of posts about the first year costs.
my husband and i always knew we wanted to start a family so we don’t complain about the money.
draw up the plans and get a list of the raw materials.
we’ve been discussing whether we’re going to need to buy a bigger car in the next year or so.
i would say we now spend about $60 a month on diapers, and let’s say $50 on other variable costs.
my money could be off but this was what would be necessary for her to have a 4 year education at a cheaper school.
from a grandparent pov.
reply a child won’t have any opportunities in our society if he or she does not exist.
especially if it’s not every day, all the time.
i’m sure that’s true, but still, wouldn’t a plain old civic be enough to accommodate 2 adults and 1 kid?
once my husband and i moved to a family plan (when he married me) all children were part of the family.
we do, however, have to spend about $700 on part-time day care, although we’re on the cheaper end of friends we have on that one.
this is no time for reproduction with all those bad mean people out there.
see, we all worked in this household.
i do still put him in disposables when his grandparents have him and at night so there is an expense there ($30 every couple of months maybe).
and the cost varies so much from month to month and child to child it’s impossible to put forth an accurate projected figure for someone else.
however, the benefits should also be considered.
on any given saturday i can (and do for resale) go out and buy like new baby clothes, toys, and supplies for dirt cheap.
even public school is not without costs for fundraisers.
huge mistake that was.
that's life and life's not fair.
reply i budget $1,300.00 a year per child.
however, drastically altering it at this point would be unpleasant for us and them.
i can only speak to the cost of animals (specifically: 4 horses, 2 dogs, 2 cats and a bunch of chickens/ducks), but as essential dependents who require the basic necessities of food/shelter/water/love – they are freaking expensive.
cloth diapers vary in price as well.
so now i shop online sales and end of season and have them shipped free.
we live in a city with one of the higher costs of living.
i’ve posted about a lot of the ways we’ve saved money in my baby on a budget series:http://preservingpennies.com/category/baby-on-a-budget/ we cloth diaper most of the time and i make my own wipes.
i think the toughest part is knowing i won’t be able to help them out with college much.
the good news is there are many ways to control these expenses.
in contrast, i only spent $56 in october and $25 of that was his halloween costume which i made and $6 of it was for a toy.
(life insurance is also a good idea, just in case.)
kids can cost more or less depending on the choices you make.
we had great medical insurance so medical costs were neglibable.
my kids are doing fine.
how to evaluate purchases.
i’m 30 and having studied for my professional qualifications i’m only now fully financially independent.
$300 for their bday parties another $1,000 for clothes and misc expenses.
when they are super younger, if you don’t have hand-me-downs, clothing can be very expensive.
now my 16 yo attends a parochial school, participates in band and follows a dress code.
reply our son is 12 now.
but like i said, this is a lifestyle choice for us.
i had my children when i was happily married and the economy was doing just fine.
$60 of that was for second hand clothes and toys that i wanted- he didn’t actually need.
has this already been done?
regardless of what your personal opinion is, the reality is that a poor economy is going to persuade fewer people to have children.
she still shares our room so there’s no increased housing cost right now.
it’s experiences that are hard to scrimp on, in our current culture where experiences tend to be organized and sold commercially… loading....
maybe special detergent for the first few weeks to wash clothes.
my wife’s parents also made her get a job early for money, and they babysat and mowed yards to save up for a lot of stuff.
no, i live in a box room in camberwell in an ex-council flat i share with 4 other people.
also: orchestra camp, 1 week, about $300.
and church shoes if your life includes that.
and they always need 2 pairs at a time – play shoes and school shoes.
sometimes that's what we parents need to do – say no to our kids when we would rather say yes, when it might be to the child's benefit to say yes.
oh wait, that’s $500 for the two kids, not per kid.
also, if you plan on ever going out, the rate for a sitter is $12-15/hour for anyone who knows how to change a diaper and isn’t a felon.
obviously, some of those expenditures are optional, but if you have enough money available to pay for those amenities and educational experiences, it is hard to refuse and decide to save it instead; there’s the feeling of intentionally depriving your child.
remember it’s just two years rear facing.
here’s her e-mail: we’re thinking about starting a family soon.
questions get the most responses.
between grandparents, birthday presents, and always having a best friend there to play with, our kids don’t need anything else, and don’t even ask for much.
unlike what tyler k says, you do not need to get a bigger car for a carseat.
mine has plenty of toys and he still happier with an empty box, a stick or a patch of dirt.
thankfully we have great health insurance, but if we didn’t this would have sunk us.
i haven’t seen anyone else mention the cost of housing.
she costs less than $500/month.
reply same area in delaware a little over 6k insurance has a max of 1k payout.
http://abdmama.wordpress.com/2012/03/21/putting-where-my-mouth-is/ the birth of our first child cost almost exactly our additional tax credit for that first year.
shame on all the indulgent fools during the great depression, wwi, wwii, other wars, the red scare, all much scarier times than now, who decided to selfishly propagate despite uncertain futures.
we’ll be sure to check that out when it comes time to buy it.
our approach to child rearing was somewhat, er, different than is the norm.
and some things you see “suggested” we didn’t get at all.
we still give her $250 a month though since she’s saving us a ton of money and peace of mind.
i don’t go out drinking or partying, unless it’s a house party.
so true, if you feel strongly about kids, there is no compromise.
reply thank you both for the feedback.
while these are “optional”, your child wants to contribute to parties and if you don’t, that means another parent is in essence paying for your child by bringing in the necessary treats and craft items.
even diapers weren’t much because i probably didn’t change him as often as i changed the first couple of kids.
just as you lament the future, we are excited for it.
must be around $1200 a month.
that, along with the carpentry and concrete projects should keep them pretty busy.
we pay $15/day for a home daycare.
everybody has extra baby clothing.
in terms of actual cash, i’d estimate that my 11 y.o. runs around $300-$500/month all in (groceries, presents, clothes, chore pay, books, entertainment, sports fees…) but not counting travel or summer camp when we go that route.
what opportunities will he or she have in our society?
the babyfood stage doesn’t last long and it takes an hour of prep time to whip up a bunch of purees for your freezer.
i breastfed all the kids and never had to buy formula.
others might have a more expensive house because they want to be in a really good school district.
in the 80s, people were still worried about the cold war and enviromental diasters.
i think we’re entering a strange new era
diapers- from 0-2 ran about $1-$2 per day.
and we are always saving for college.
i can’t fathom spending as much as some of you spend per month on a child.
you can be creative and find ways to save with food, clothes, childcare, transportation, housing, etc.
as they age, i’d say costs don’t necessary go down.
activities- this varies.
disposable diapers are costly, not just from their base price, but also from the increased trips to the store if you choose that option.
if that’s not the case, i’m surprised you made it as long as you did.
people made fun of hilary clinton for saying “it takes a village to raise a child.”
it can be hard to resist toys and things that we think that she’ll like
i nursed for 13 months.
reply we spent very little on start-up costs: we were very lucky with hand-me-downs and gifts for large ticket items.
there’s nobody ahead of her to inherit clothes from and i’m trying to warm my wife up to the idea of buying second-hand clothing.
my youngest was practically free.
again, getting a different carseat is less expensive than getting a different car!
it not only costs time and money but reduces your income because of time away from work.
most plans cover well child visits 100% (and will have to under health care reform)
and adding her to our health insurance was about $80/month.
most of that cost is his daycare, some of it is food that mainly he eats (waffles!), some of it is impulse purchases (the new comb and brush after he does a great job getting a haircut).
older kids eat more and wear out their clothes; far more significantly, they want to take gymnastics and music lessons and go to day camps during the summer.
they basically said that a kid needs more stuff than you think.
they don’t need a fancy crib (they can sleep pretty much anywhere), they don’t need a lot of different toys and gizmos, they can eat breast milk and regular grownup food that’s been mashed up, they can wear hand-me-down clothes (because baby clothes only fit for a few weeks or months and then are ready to be passed on) and cloth diapers.
in fact i didn’t run into any home daycare providers who were not licensed.
0-3 we paid $8,500 for a babysitter to care for our son in her home.
(795) a place of my own (572) contact (546) the lazy way to investment success (489) ask the readers: how much do you spend on housing?
in 2011, for the family of 4 we spent approximately: $2568 – apparel $1500 – non-tuition education $2000 – sports and music (not counting entrance fees or going out with the team afterwards) $1400 – braces for the 12 yo – full payment we could go on about bigger car, more food (i have teen boys), bigger house, replacing furniture they get careless with, medical and dental costs… now, of course, a lot of this is optional.
as they got older, i purchased high quality toys and clothes at yard sales.
my oldest has a job and he buys his own video games, etc. as well as saving for college.
my pregnancy was expensive, but since he’s only had two sick appointments.
my son has a rear-facing seat, so that requires me to climb in the backseat to take him in and out.
don’t make hopeful parents sound so selfish for wanting to have a family.
similar to children (i would imagine), they cost a lot to feed (but at least it’s a fairly consistent $-amount each month), their anticipated medical care (vaccinations) costs a lot, their emergency medical care when one gets sick (or breaks his tail) costs a small-fortune, and making sure their barn/habitat is kept up is also expensive.
reply we have 2 teenage sons, 14 and 16.
currently we’re paying $8000/year for private school plus $45/day for summer camp.
it’s the other things that can get tricky.
amazon for diapers is a great deal.
i have plenty of time to think about those days wistfully as i fight for survival and huddle here with my brood and 300 fellow squatters in this burned out abandoned apple store under what says it was once a “genuis bar”, fighting off invaders from the nearby abercrombie camp trying to swipe our dwindling supply of potted meats and youtube videos.
instead of buying them school lunches, which were costing almost $5 each per day for my sons, we started sending them to school with packed lunches.
they spend one week with us, one week with their dad, etc., so i have a fairly clear picture of the difference in grocery cost, at least.
just take your car with you when picking out seats/strollers, to make sure they fit.
mostly goes to doctor visit co-pays, prescriptions, etc.
there are lots of people picking up money on the side by having groups of children stay in their homes while parents work.
it was much cheaper as we did second hand “mommy swap” clothing for an infant, but found it doesn’t work well for toddlers.
the plan is to save up together for community college in 2013.
connected my son is 3.5 and in full-time daycare.
our experience is- daycare, daycare, daycare!!!!
will you have to pay a thousand dollars for day care a month or not.
(and your parents sound like really cool people).
# 99: i’m not sure how it works in the uk, but in the u.s., adopting a child domestically from the foster care system is free.
i buy as many of our clothes as i can used, or wait for big sales.
we’ve saved up a little over $1000 for his education costs since he’s been born which has been funded entirely by the government money and some money gifted to him when he was born.
it’s just that so many people say “just do it” when it comes to kids without really communicating the difficulties of being a parent.
so team fees, shoes and other personal equipment, entrance fees for games (football and basketball) team parties, team fund raisers, our turn to take team snacks…
at the same time, a lot of those costs later on are going to depend on your parenting style and choices.
(436) basic tips on tipping: how much and to whom?
once he started eating, we went with table food.
i was lucky enough to get some work audio typing, but it’s very ad-hoc, so i’m only making about £90 a month.
after here, i don’t know but my father-in-law keeps telling me the costs go up.
reply don’t forget to add on $100 – $500 to fund a baby’s 529 college fund (depending on what you can budget), but it should be something.
remember that your retirement always comes first then your kids college.
reply how can you drop a bombshell like that?
i’m sure we’ll be ready to swap out the ’01
reply matt, by all means, have as many children as you like.
for the love of god, please only have children if you are 100% sure you’re ready and you want to make the sacrifices required to be a parent.
we’ll up the amount as we go, but we’re in it 50/50 with him.
my son and daughter had money from their grandparents.
it costs $12,000 per year.
that means the second kid can’t reuse the first kid’s car seat or stroller, and though you don’t really have to buy two of everything, you do need twice as many shoes, diapers, etc.
i’ve noticed now that little buddy is three we spend about $200 a year on sports, museum trips etc for him.
you can’t even take care of yourself.
drivers ed, license fees, car insurance… my 12 yo is in public school, but there was still a materials fee of about $80 for the year, plus 6th grade camp ($120), t-shirts for field day, pto carnival, skating parties, lunches, school supplies, transportation costs include his bike (recently tuned up for $80), or us driving him the mile in bad weather.
i would lower your contributions to the 529 and make sure that you are maxing out your roth.
to me this is an ongoing expense.
and i generally knew within minutes on the phone they happened.
well, y’all know where the tools are.
they prefer to work for others right now because they know that business owners have no time that is really “off” or “free” but are quite capable of running their own businesses and, indeed, have in the past.
reply we’ll check back w/you in 5-10 years, lol!
just because you’re physically capable of having a child and other people are doing it, that doesn’t mean it’s the right choice for you.
you either have children or you don’t.
wow, i have no idea a dollar amount.
we don’t make a lot of money but we are careful and we have a pretty good life.
this year so far i’ve spent $190 on him and $50 of that was for baby-sitting.
days, evenings, weekends.
we’re fairly sure a second car seat will fit in there too (though we’re hoping dc will have graduated to a booster by then so it won’t be quite so cramped with the infant + 5 year old).
this does not count the fsa tax break but also doesn’t include groceries, which probably cancel each other out.
i don’t provide my kids with cell phones, laptops or any other gadget they want.
not sure why my insurance changed, but it did.
domestic ones more like $300-500.
for a family of 4, our grocery budget is $600 a month.
i did not see if you would be a working parent or if one of you would stay home.
if you buy them on sale and use coupons, i would say it costs about $25/month for diapers and wipes.
she isn’t doing anything to her parents.
– i think there’s a girl… look back at a recent post… (you’ll need to click on a link)
your kids will thank you for it when you forgo fancy baby frills and instead have the money for them to pursue their dreams later on.
reply i think $500 (even for both kids) is too high.
the rest of that was for diapers- i stocked up because of a good sale.
all the research i’ve done shows them performing very poorly, so i just don’t trust that it’s a good place to pour money at the moment… loading....
it’s an hour here, 1/2 day there, full day if they get sick.
yes, we kept our 100k miles 4-door alero until #3 came along and we couldn’t figure out away to get all 3 carseats in the back.
the good news is that baby costs are pretty fixed so it’s possible to budget.
my niece’s father has a 2 door sports car-ish thing that he bought when he had no plans for kids and wanted something cool.
one additional expense with children is good life insurance- a must!
not only more space, but as you get older there is pressure to live in a town with a good public school system, nice parks & playgrounds, and safe.
had i stayed home longer, completed a bachelor’s degree (i have an associates) and so on, i would probably be in a much better position now.
rates & offers from advertisers shown on this website change  frequently, sometimes without notice.
negative population growth is not good for an economy that continuously needs more money pumped into it to survive.
you can find nice, safe, inexpensive cribs.
do the costs go up or down as the child grows?
get out of debt as seen in: the wall street journal, money  magazine...

we have pretty good benefits that pay for baby chiropractic visits (yup) and the couple of prescriptions we’ve needed.
you know how we’re having a bit of a jobs crisis right now?
but i think to recommend <$200 as a budgeting figure is unrealistic and will be necessarily thrusting a parentally imposed "difference" upon a child.
i also know that these costs can vary greatly, but having never been a parent before, i have no idea what the range can be.
toys and equipment- you don’t need to buy toys.
if that's all we're talking about, less than $200 is difficult but doable.
she wants to know how much you spend on kids.
that’s the stuff that really costs.
i started buying diapers on sale from the day i found out i was pregnant.
reply you are absolutely correct–more people should be thinking like this.
to anyone contemplating having a child — do it!
no day care cost because i stayed home.
but my wife and i always wonder what people give up with the $1000 a month daycare.
by the time that comes along anyway.
the children have a ton of requests from their school for parties and special events, as well as fundraisers.
ru, obviously only you and your parents are able to pass judgment on what is acceptable in your relationship with money and university… but you have to be willing to be honest with yourself as well.
reply clues from a longtime reader (i hope j.d. posts this comment!)
we bought a gently used electric piano, but it was still several hundred dollars.)
i can’t tell if your comment was tongue-in-cheek, but i didn’t detect even a twinge of guilt in what you’re doing to your parents.
the original cost of the cloth diapers that we use ran us about $400 but they are well worth it
maybe how to feed yourself and the missus for a week on one squirrel and/or chipmunk?
there are fund raisers, retreats and service opportunities (yes we pay).
i should mention that we will soon start saving up for her college at the tune of abour $300 per month.
i am raising 3 grandkids (who would have otherwise gone to foster care) and between dcotors, dentists, eyeglasses, ortho, etc, etc my husband
i agree with deborah , either you do or you don’t want kids.
i do think a 4 door vehicle is better, though.
she didn’t make any mention of having her own family yet, she just observed how much she’d cost her parents over the years.
one thing to consider is your support system.

it’s a good question.
thankfully we have plenty of room in our budget to handle these costs, but i sure will be glad when we are done paying for daycare!
the world has always had such doom and gloom.
will you want everything?
that runs about $850 each.
my parents could see that i wasn’t happy where i was
because of these things our ongoing costs have been very low.
i eat mainly vegetables and rice.
you could probably easily stay under $200 a month otherwise.
our daughter is 4 months old.
summer care is about $150 per week per child.
they basically said that a kid need more stuff than you think.
the baby justs wants you to love it.
unless you make a ton of money the childcare and doctor’s visits will eat up your earnings from the job.
you just budget and do it.
reply we have three children ages 8, 5, and 2.
we re-use everything, kids share rooms, and we already bought the minivan after the first child!
the sheer selfishness of some people, bringing lives into the world that might not live at the extremely high materialistic level we’ve become accustomed to the last 40+ years.
we have a 10 month old and we’ve spent very little money on him so far.
by the same token if one of you stays at home, that can also be a cost-only you can do the math.
i always assumed (maybe i read too much into things) that you and kris both did not want children.

if you are thinking of having children it is wise to investigate the costs.
cheap ways to stay warm how much should i tip?
it’s not as easy to creatively save your way out of an unexpected $10,000 hospital bill.
my husband and i limit our kids to two extracurricular activities each, and we pay $500-$700 per month on this depending on what the kids are doing at any given time.
going to a family event in chicago is twice as expensive as it used to be now that we have two kids who need their own seats.
what i am talking about is the time away from any sort of income producing efforts and the time they take from your personal life.
for some reason i’m having a devil of a time posting it to him.
for instance, two weekly music lessons; participation in theater groups, bands, and choirs; camps; sports; and public school fees add up to $3000-$4000 a year.
childcare was a while ago, but yes, it was expensive, even for part time after-school afternoons.
just put the seat in the middle and go!
definitely check sizes in person — the two big problems you will have with a smaller car are getting a stroller into the trunk (some of the super-strollers are huge even when folded) and getting some rear-facing seats in.
reply i have a 16 month old that i budget $100 a month for as far as diapers, clothing, and incidentals.
reply one of the reasons we chose a more rural area was that we wanted room for a home-based business as well as for kids to grow.
as to babysitters, in my area the price ranges from $5/hour for a young teen to watch the kids while you go out someplace local for an hour or two to $15/hour for an adult if you are going to be gone long or go far.
reply this suggests an “ask the readers” column about the cost of pets.
on the upside, we spend almost nothing on toys.
new babies need car seats, a place to sleep, a place to eat, and a place to put their clothing in terms of furiture.
the first few months were higher since we had to grab some items we didn’t receive on the baby registry.

(when my father wondered aloud one time why there were no grandchildren, my mother reminded him that i’d been saying “no raising kids for me” since i was 10.)i married a man who seemed ok with that idea, but turns out he really did want children.
those prices are simply outrageous.
we’ll probably not be so strict, but i definitely think having the kids have their own skin in the game is the best.
reply interesting response, ru; i share the same sentiment – 18 is not some magic number where the financial obligation ends.
my hope is that i will be back to work by the time the first enters college and we can help pay some of the tuition costs out of my income.
we barely noticed him, budget wise.
i too dream of somehow ‘hitting the big time’
he has gotten a little less expensive over time, but i think 5-7 are going to be the golden years (public school and not much after school activity).
look into how much it will cost per month to add a child to your policy and think about how you will set aside enough to cover your entire deductible if you have to.
these towns cost more to live in.
we’ll see how that changes when they get older (they are 4 right now) and start playing sports or getting into separate hobbies where supplies can’t be shared.
they don’t actually get to have one.
we found generics to be a waste because they had to be changed more and often didn’t hold at night.
my mother in law watches her during the day so that saves a ton of money.
reply $1250/month for daycare, ~75/month medical on average, and ~50/month on food for our 1-year old.

clothing/toys is really negligible, since there are so many used options, but childcare is really expensive!
she tried to refuse at first
thanks for the laugh, wilson!
much of that is tuition, though.
i may adopt or foster.
we have 529s set up for each child to save for college, but those are mostly funded by gifts from family at christmas and birthdays, and we haven’t been able to regularly contribute to them ourselves in awhile.
we spend at least $45 on diapers and $7 on wipes (we buy in bulk at sams – so 1 box of wipes lasts us at least 2 months.
what is your attitude to new and used stuff.
nothing special to dad, but his kid thought it was the best ever.
it’s a good idea to try them in the car before purchasing.
i hope that turns around soon.
it’s not an imperative, but it’s something i’d enjoy, i think.
we pay about 700$/month in daycare costs and under 100$/month in other items (toys, diapers, etc.).
check your maternity coverage, as well as what coverage you will have if your child is born prematurely or with any kind of health problem.
children do get more expensive as they get older.
so right now, the total is about $130 per month, $280 if we include giving the mother in law money.
my sons are 16 and 12.
small children really need very, very little to be very, very happy.
we managed to avoid getting a bigger car, but if we had already had one kid in a car seat before the twins were born, we wouldn’t have been able to fit three car seats in our tiny honda civic, so a new car would have been part of the cost.
you find yourself needing the bigger house in the better school district which costs more.
the financial adviser recommends more than $500/mo/kid?
big one last year to vienna – $2500.
mine just started public school, so no more daycare, but this means $300/month for afterschool care.
much of this you can figure out yourself, in terms of early life.
but be careful if the pump is old and overworked it won’t do the job well.
i’d save the judgment for after you know all the facts.
and i say this as someone whose child almost never asks for “stuff”– even if you’ve managed to raise a non-materialistic child, they can still be expensive at school age.
for instance, our daycare costs are lower than most because my mother-in-law watches our kids.
other costs will depend on how much you decide to spend.

we get more of her seasonal and short term baby gear from a nice consignment store in the area.
last time i checked parents are usually the “adults” in the parent-child relationship (even if both parties are legal adults) and have control over the decisions they are making.
i do feel immensely grateful to my mum and dad though.
reply i think you can do it with a two door so long as you find a seat that fits.
reply wait until the old-age vet bills start rolling in.
also, she’ll start day care when she’s 2 and prices for that are ranging from $600-$1100 per month.
but i think the biggest “cost” — and joy — has to do with time.
we get invited to a lot of children’s parties, which average to $20 month.
the flip side is we eat out less, we see fewer movies, we are not doing any major renovation at the house until he’s more mature… so there is some savings there.
(but isn’t that “so far” kind of interesting?i think so.)
you just need to know when it’s more than a sniffle
we spent about 700$ in preparing for our baby (car seats, etc.).
you can go used, just buy new parts and only use the used moter.
and i am sure now that i’ve expressed this, i will be told how unfit i am to parent.
because you can withdraw your roth contributions to help fund their college tax and penalty free at any time.
there are no real expenses outside of what i have outlined.
lessons & classes: viola $50 a week, aikido $90 a month school trips: variable, of course, but our viola player has both jazz band and orchestra trips.
given the very high cost of adoption and the ongoing costs of kids that many have discussed in the comments (which would seem to apply regardless of biological/adopted/foster origins), how do you see your choice to not have *biological* kids as a cost-savings?
she’s at the beginning of her financial journey, and kudos to her for thinking about something that many people’s don’t worry about until their parents are in dire straights.
at 3 it was time to send him to full time preschool (much more stimulating).
i wouldn’t be driving a gas guzzling minivan on my 30 minute each way commute if we didn’t have kids.
but that’s hard to add up and not really necessary.
we had our baby girl last year and for the most part expenses have been minimal.
often when i’m weighing a purchase i ask myself, “how did my parents do it, and how did my grandparents do it, what is different about today?”
similarly, toys seem to magically appear in large numbers because everybody else has too many too.
those of us who have had the privilege of that support are (mostly) extremely grateful for it.
working in the studio is 10 to 6 (or later) job, and it doesn’t leave much scope for part time work, especially when you have no bar or retail experience and the employers in london have a massive pool to draw from.
i think the biggest thing is, if you’re going to have kids, plan on spending more time than anything else.
you can’t predict the future, but if you assume the worst, you’ll be paralyzed.
but other than that, most everything can be used – clothes, crib, books, toys.
there is no “girl” or woman.
we were lucky enough to have very few “start-up” costs — we were gifted our crib, carseat, many clothes, toys, etc.
food is cheap – breastfeeding and basby food right now.
those early years were tight while my son in law served his country.
her goal to raise a family one day!
and i’m not particularly confident in the footing yet.
it’s easier when you make a large salary and have a big emergency fund set up.
another variable is whether your school district has half-day or all-day kindergarten.
the costs do vary wildly.
reply assuming you’re in the u.s., what kind of health benefits do you have?
reply dial down the concern, kevin.
my wife and i really did think our civics would work, but at the same time, we wanted to be prepared for the possibility that they wouldn’t.
we pay around $300 per month per child for after-school care, and another $300 per week for our kids to go to the town rec dept camp in summer, or to child care on school vacations.
bigger cars are important in carpooling and that’s sort of a must with multiple kids.
but i am not saying it as some clueless dink who has never had kids, i know exactly how much money and work it takes–we have a 10-year-old now.
how will you diaper your baby…figure out use and check out the adds for diapers.
of course the costs will increase as she starts to be able to “do” more — but we will embrace those costs.
you’ll get most as gifts and they don’t play with much anyway.
it has enriched our lives so much — the exhaustion and money is a small price to pay.”
fast forward to today: i’m a single mom and the economy is in the pits.
we also get about $140 a month from the government for him.
this doesn’t include occasional nights out, or lost wages when a kid is sick and someone has to stay home, or summer camp for the week the preschool is closed between the school year and the summer session.
yet our poor abused kids turned out to be competent, independent adults with many skills that are getting paid more than the friends’ and relatives’ kids who got a free ride through college.
do they mean when the kids are out of the (by then) paid for house?
you don’t need a changing table – put a pad on top of a waist high dresser.
i’m talking about food, lessons, sports equipment and fees, braces and other dental, medical co pays and insurance, school trips, gas to drive them to practice and friends’ homes, bicycles, larger home, higher utilities, etc.
dr. visits outside the norm may or may not be considered emergency expenses.
reply just to terrify anyone contemplating children, i would like to point out that my brother turns 25 this year and is still living at home.
so if you have an easy pregnancy, easy delivery and well child these costs can be minimal.
(397) the official grs referral swapping thread (379) ask the readers: how much do you spend on food?
will your health insurance rates increase, and do they cover maternity and well baby care.
reply i’ve seen plenty of car seats in civics and corollas while out driving … my question is about a 2 door car.
on the plus side, if we have another child the premiums would about stay the same.
and kids don’t start school until kindergarten (pre-k is not guarenteed), so you’re looking at 5 years of childcare per child.
you can skip many of the things you’re marketed for a baby and be perfectly fine.
so maybe you aren’t going “cower in a corner” but many people will.
it’s not a decision to be taken lightly.
we’ll be doing the same for my middle son, and they’re spaced just far enough apart that we won’t likely have overlap in needs.
if you don’t want to respond to the question, fine, but please spare us your lecture, which is irrelevant to the issue posed.
the carseat had to go in the middle and it got cramped if anyone else was sitting in the backseat but it was just fine for 2 adults and baby.
reply i have not read ahead.
from talking with friends and family who have kids, quite a few have sort of laughed at us when we told them that we weren’t planning on buying a bigger car.

babies have the initial costs of crib/stroller/clothing/etc, but many can be obtained secondhand for little or no money.
and that’s a cash price.
crowded but totally doable.
even if you were never 100% on having kids, being with somebody that is 100% on not having kids seems like it would be very difficult.
reply steve, don’t let the “jonses’” influence you.
get all the hand me downs and used stuff you can.
the baby doesn’t know or care how much the crib costs or if the comforter and pillow sham match.
and there are many licensed home daycare providers in my area.
and my mum has told me specifically that she would like to live with me in old age so i can keep an eye on her.
big children need more, not all that much more sometimes, but still i would say save the baby money you want to spend for later.
not impossible but definitely not pleasant.
reply i totally agree with eve’s comment – babies can be super-cheap.
- we budget $600 per month for groceries (including toiletries), $200 per month for take-out/restaurants - clothing has been very minimal (esp since they don’t go to school), but shoe costs are rising as they get older.
you don’t need any of that crap.
the cost of child care can also vary significantly within a metro area.
lube up the shotgun and run for the hills!
so, the odds of me having children have gone from 0% to something more than that.
i breastfed, and the most expensive thing was the pump @ $300 for a new pump.
i’m 6’4″ and drive an ’08 civic coupe that’s paid off.
we started a baby fund when we found out we were expecting to cover baby expenses and to smooth out our cash flow for the first months.
hotels are not accomodating to large families; with any lodging (camping, etc) we have to get creative.
spend about $500-$600 on curriculum each year, about $200 on field trips.
if i were in your shoes, i’d feel obligated to do everything in my power to 1) get off their teat, and 2) pay them back.
i’m learning something new every day about this baby business:)
this is one of the few deal-breaker issues in a marraige that can’t be worked out with compromise.
we never spent much on baby food.

a safe car seat can be found for about $100.
now you can foster kittens.
food, clothes, activities, and daycare are the easy things to figure out.
we pretty much only use an umbrella stroller, which have very little footprint on trunk space.
even if it means going through 3 carseat stages before hitting booster stage rather than 2.
if we’d have set up a payment plan or used a credit card, it’d be a lot more.
while i’ll probably never be able to pay them back, i’m going to make sure i look after them in old age.
we both work full time.
they go thru 3 different sizes in the first year alone.
she’s finishing up her degree, and lots of students have help from their parents in university.

reply fwiw, not every mother who plans to breastfeed finds that she is able to.
crib, car seats (cannot buy those used), stroller, clothes.
for us, it’s really important to value his education, make sure he has healthy food available, and that we have a lot of time together as a family.
right now we have ’01 and ’05 honda civics (both paid off and still running decently).
so, you’ve always wanted children, at least to some degree?
i also started a college saving plan of about $150 per month.
some people do “baby” classes and such.
hard to estimate the “miscellaneous” costs, maybe another 50.
i’d like to hear from readers about how much they spend per month on their children.
reply i don’t feel guilty, because i haven’t forced them to do anything, they can afford it and, most importantly- they planned for it.
maybe another $30 a month but soon we’ll start making and blending it ourselves to help with that too.
childcare is expensive.
i breastfeed and make my own baby food.
im assuming your car is baby appropriate and you dont have to move from a sports car to a real car.
mine are adults but its easy to do the math on formula.
i don’t know if you know this, but design university is not like other universities.
not every seat will fit in there and i contemplated replacing it with a four door, but it’s just not worth the extra cost.
reply i’ll just give you a snapshot of where we’re at; you can use it to compare to other commenters’ age scenarios.
and teenage boys never stop eating.
it’s typically cheaper than a daycare facility and from what i’ve found, better care.
so it’s better for your children.
how can you possibly support yourself, a family, and your parents on a starving artist’s income?
i recommend calling around and seeing if you can find someone who does care from their home, just a few kids.
i had a barely used infant car seat from my sister along with all necessary clothes, i wore my babies in a sling and never really used a stroller or a crib or other expensive baby gear (much of which can be borrowed quite easily).
i do want to point out that the marginal cost for each additional child is not as much as those initial costs.
but if the village has your back, raising a child is so much easier!
if you have to work, childcare can be expensive and it varies wildly too.
i spend zero dollars per month on children because, so far, i’ve elected not to have any.
food costs about $60 – $70 per month because she’s not 100% on our food.
this right here is why we are not having more children.
summer was worse because it was full-day.
babies need: -somewhere safe to sleep -clothes and blankets to keep them warm -something to catch their waste -food (breast milk, formula, etc) -parents to love them -a car seat if you plan to drive them anywhere everything else is gravy loading....
and kids don’t need to go to the doctor for every sniffle!!!
i have no idea but ru is doing, but given that she’s 22 and earning her degree, i’d guess that she’s in training for some kind of professional career – many professions involve studying and limited earning potential until well into your 20s.
i’d also recommend a new car seat, just for the safety features/requirements.
reply is your cost for braces post dental insurance?
their miserable wretch offspring surely got their comeuppance, what with living in houses (with a/c!), driving motorized vehicles (often enclosed), and screens displaying flickering images (from b&w to in your hand).
however, just because the law says all daycare providers must be licensed doesn’t mean that they all are.
not things like glasses and health coverage, obviously, but those extra classes and camps and cool clothes and videogames and the big mini-van and so on.
some of it is the extra cost of travel (technically he could fly free until he was two but has had his own seat since he was about 15 months because oh my mama needs a little room to breathe while being super zen on a plane).
especially if your alternative is to go into debt to buy another car.
stop thinking of yourself for a minute and think of your future child.
and it doesn’t end there.
this is what i plan to do if i ever do decide to have children.
smaller cohorts mean more labor demand and higher salaries for people born during a baby bust.
i expect this to roll right into tuition for school which will be less at private k-8 for us, but about the same for high school and more for college.
also, if you are on a budget, it helps to teach kids about money management as early as possible so they can help make the choices with you, so they don’t ever feel denied — but that’s a whole different subject.
you might not mind buying that first car seat, but (depending on where you live) you may be surprised that you still are buying booster seats many years later.
we all need to take care of each other or it just simply won’t function.
well, it sounds like you were careful, which is what i was talking about.
my whole life i’d been trying to live up to this future they’d projected on to me (they wanted a scientist or a doctor), and then when i left school i was not only working full time but looking after my boyfriend who had severe depression.
this one should cost something like $90 with the three copays i’ll have to pay.
reply that ‘so far’ is really interesting!
but the big thing is spending <$200 would involve a lot of "no" – no little league, no scouting, no school play, no math tutor, no dance lessons, no field trips, etc.
i don’t have kids myself, but i’ve noticed a big variation among my friends.
instead of paying for diapers and daycare, i’m paying for lots of food, clothes they outgrow so fast i can’t believe it, dance lessons, and lots of miscellaneous expenses (i need $10 for this school trip, etc.).
loading.... i’m not trying to speak to j.d.’s situation, but generally speaking i don’t see that difference as that significant.
they really add up, but there are ways to soften the blow.
daughter was doing demolition work when she was old enough to hold a tiny little sledgehammer.
from 2-3 we have still had to use 1 diaper at night which costs about $0.21.
when my son was born, we had a 4-door mitsubishi lancer (about the size of a civic) and that worked just fine for us.
babies can be very cheap.
kids are as expensive as you make them.
life is not all playing in the park and in the backyard, particularly with school aged children.
after 2 years of working in an office straight out of school, i was presented an amazing opportunity: a place at the best art school in europe.
we have to provide transportation and school is 13 miles from home.
find a way for the mom or dad to stay home with the baby for the first 2 years at a minimum.
he plays sports all year around – football, basketball, soccer, baseball.
we hope to continue the generosity.
day care costs would force one of us to stay home, and neither of us is willing to give up another two years or more of work to do it.
she never claimed she would be a starving artist (shockingly, there are artists that actually make money), and she acknowledged she’s still in school.
when she was very little, we had the added cost of formula – probably $40 – $60 per month.
so far it has just come to us in the form of presents and hand-me-downs.
babies don’t need that much.
(i’ve never been able to do hand-me-downs for shoes–they get too worn out.)
and there are even car seats narrow enough to do 3 across — we have an older radian car seat and you could fit 3 across in even most small cars if you had too.
and you’ll be in your office all day trying to achieve 8oz for the next day.

we had a honda when the kids were little, replaced it with a malibu a few years back.
they should pay for some of the expenses too by working while in school.
but it enhances the experience.
i don’t mind having excess money in the first 529, since transferring to kid #2 should be easy, but i’m not sure that i want to either take a penalty or finance a distant relative’s education with excess.
i was really worried about paying for everything that comes with a new baby while i was pregnant, but now, i see that she doesn’t cost much at all.
that’s the toughest time.
my wife is pregnant with our first right now and is due in october.
for the record, i am childfree, but contemplating.
that’s a good way to “stop thinking about yourself.”
it’s hard to totally calculate based on what you’ve seen.
look around your community for mom sales (they happen a lot).
i waver between no to a very sheepish “i don’t know” – which probably means no in the long run.
and that means that you get to be at work for the bare minimum of any regular job–9ish to 5ish.
our friends and relatives were horrified that our small children were doing their own laundry and taking turns with the household chores and cooking.
no free rides for anybody.
so now is the time to be reproducing!
some children are raised with the expectation that their parents will support them through college – just because she appears to be one of these people does not make her a bad person.
easier to get junior in and out of carseats that way.
- sports, club, etc fees are about $200-$400 year, depending.

he is given $80 a month for his lunches/allowance.
reply we have a big range (2, 11, 16 and one on the way)
how will you feed your baby.
my husband and i laugh, though, when financial planners tell us we’ll need to replace 80% of our income when we retire.
besides the childcare this included 529 savings, toys, (mostly 2nd hand) clothing, diapers, (limited) recreational activities, and school lunch.
as they get older that will change some, but i think the teenagers who want nothing to do with their parents are that way because from 7-12 they had little to do with them.
the £250 rent he pays to my parents gets redistributed to his little sister (me, aged 22) to make sure she doesn’t starve in the big city while she earns her degree, so my long suffering ma and pa are in the hole from putting him up.
reply such variation in this expense!
the walmart brand is just as good as the name brands assuming you just need a regular formula.
that might be the yearly cost, prorated loading....
(whether you work part-time or not at all, or you still work full-time but now can’t put in extra hours — it’s all time you could have spent earning more money.
“real” summer day camps can cost $700+ per week.
she’s likely got at least 30 years before she will actually be supporting her parents, if indeed that is necessary.
if you work you won’t have time.
what a gloomy way to look at things!
their clothes and shoes cost more, they eat more, they like to participate in activities.
we were paying $8/hr for one-on-one care, $690/month for infant daycare, and $590/month for preschool, all in a mostly rural area.
she’s the best kid in the world–but i still wouldn’t have another.
the easily quantifiable costs are relatively easy, but highly variable situation to situation.
plus the extra seat on the plane.
