kids with autism are often louder, more perseverative, and more likely to tantrum than typical kids.as a result, a classroom filled with children on the spectrum is unlikely to be a relaxed, creative, or even predictable place.he even suggests that some non-autistics can learn the language well enough to be fluent.most autistic folk learn what we can for survival, some non-autie parents do, too.deaf individuals can tell if someone is comfortable with them by observing “body language” which is again, a form of communication.twins have been known to come up with their own “language” to communicate with one another.his suggestion is that the "language of autism" can be likened to "italian," in that it's a particular way of communicating that can be predicted, replicated, and understood on its own terms by native speakers.even when i was unable to speak as a little kid, according to my parents (both likely autistic), i communicated clearly with my eyes and actions; as an adult, while my non-autistic ex couldn't 'read' my non-verbal communication, my autistic ex definitely could.both auties and non-auties only natively communicate with our own kind, have to learn the other, and don't pick it up much easier as babies.as a result, i find it perfectly believable that autistics may socially connect one on one with each other using attention to minute details that are important to them which nts seldom notice.a phenomenon my son’s therapists labeled “overselectivity” very obviously played a key role in many of his difficulties with developing language.i have consistently found a strong correlation between these qualities and intellectual curiosity.the shutdown reinforces the myth that just because non-auties don't natively understand us, we must not be communicating.i don’t think autists care about any emotional state other than extreme anger, fear or aggression, and they are especially attuned to whether someone is glancing at them.i’m not saying this is the sole form of communicating, but throwing him a few his way, like learning at least a few words in italian, won’t do harm and in fact seems to open more to focusing on what i am saying and how i am saying it to better understand my meaning.
