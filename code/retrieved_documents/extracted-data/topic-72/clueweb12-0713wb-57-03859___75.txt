so it is not lightly that we have decided a few times to produce non-open software, such as the mysql monitor introduced some years ago.
we have been experimenting with a variety of business models around foss (dual licensing, support only, simple subscriptions, different binaries for community and enterprise, non-open source features) to find the best one.
given the size and nature of this move, i don't begrudge sun anything in its commitment to open source.

the mysql server could not have evolved as much as it did (not that i am saying it has evolved perfectly) if we hadn't had a revenue stream to fund the hiring of developers and others.
