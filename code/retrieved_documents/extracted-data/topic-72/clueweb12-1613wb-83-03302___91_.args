kids are also encouraged to participate in leadership and community service projects, again often taking on organizational roles that one might assume are only for older kids.if they need to have an educational advocate, therapist, adult friend, or other non-parental helpful person sitting next to them to help them understand what is going on and to help them figure out how to express their own ideas appropriately, then that’s a great service to provide for them.in any domain, there are likely to be quite a lot of skills which can be meaningfully taught at an appropriate level by someone who is further along the path, such thatboth teacher and learner are able to meaningfully increase their understanding and skill, and to derive self-efficacy from doing so.judges in all events are explicitly told to give clear and understandable feedback on which aspects of the entry were done well and how the entry could be improved, and to measure kids against developmentally-appropriate but meaningfully high standards.absent certain really seriously exacerbating circumstances, adults have the right to make their own decisions, no matter how foolish.kids who show promise in these areas get noticed and encouraged to take on more responsibility.you also can’t teach organizational skills by imposing a system that is complex and onerous enough that kids need you to direct them every inch of the way.all offer low-cost methods for kids to take out-of-level achievement tests (because they’d hit the ceilings of grade-level achievement tests, of course!), qualifying them to take courses designed for gifted kids.cognitive-behavioral techniques can be really usefulas tools, but a flexible and collaborative approach is going to be key.getting professional help (from a formal assessment, a therapy relationship, a career counselor familiar with gifted kids (i.e., who won’t just say, “ooh, you’re so wonderful, you can be anything you want to be!”) can provide another helpful outside perspective.mentors can also help link a kid up with long-term experiences where they can get their hands dirty and become part of the action, particularly as they move into the teen years.4-h is a very flexible program, which can definitely be bewildering at times, but the flexibility is great for gifted and 2e kids.if a kid has iq and achievement scores both above 145, there are some great opportunities available through thedavidson institute for talent development.what i think is most helpful is for those kids to have ongoing mentor relationships with adults in the field, folks who will honestly answer questions and suggest routes by which kids can meaningfully explore and pursue their passions.planning work time also requires kids to predict how long they think a task or subtask will take… and thus provides a good opportunity for them to also track how long somethingactually took, so that they can become more accurate predictors in the future.
