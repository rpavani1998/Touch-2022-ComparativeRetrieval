i think that language learning is the same way.
work that kids just saw as part of life and occured naturally for them in their daily activities.

adults learning a foreign language think it is hard because they are more conscious of the effort they are exerting in order to gain this new skill and knowledge.
so do i think that it is easier for kids to learn a foreign language than adults.
but if you work hard you will learn the language.

im not sure that it is an easier for younger children to learn a foreign language but it does seem that the end result is a more fluid and natural speaker of the 2nd language.
adults can achieve the same results but it takes time and hard work.
language has a humbling effect and probably takes the same amount of time to learn as an adult as it does as a child.
