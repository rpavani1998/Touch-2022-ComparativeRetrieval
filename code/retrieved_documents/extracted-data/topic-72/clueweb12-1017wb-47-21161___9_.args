africa has been a home to al-qaeda before and it could be again, and ending the cycles of debt and poverty is one of the best things the west can do to prevent future attacks - certainly better than starting superfluous wars against al-qaeda's arab enemies.it’s also relevant as a guide for revamping characters.i love writing for this blog:  it's led to a great sense of community with many people i've never met and it's even generated a few pieces that have led to more professionally beneficial works.i love writing for this blog: it's led to a great sense of community with many people i've never met and it's even generated a few pieces that have led to more professionally beneficial works.but they are a reminder that even the simplest words of support can have a profound impact.in fact, it leads to the destruction of the government that tortures and kills her.it wasn't so long ago that these vultures were blubbering about our own tragedies and thanking the british for their tremendous show of support but that kindness hasn't been repaid; i guess africans aren't the only people looking for 100% debt relief.x-force suffered a painful decline: first from an ill-advised name change (reportedly so marvel wouldn’t have to pay liefeld for the rights) that caused them to hemorrhage readers, then from corporate interference that gutted a major storyline which might have revitalized the book.actually, it was the manufactured, shoot-the-messenger furor following the release of that report that finally got me to send in my money; i hope amnesty's willingness to do the right thing and speak out against torture even in the face of such withering (and appalling) hostility and denial earned them many more new members.an amnesty note that included selected portions of her letter would be truly inspirational - but moore doesn't own those words anymore, and besides, the thought of sending real political prisoners letters of encouragement penned by fictional characters is unspeakably depressing.it's the moral center of a book that compromises every other moral stance, including the stance of inaction, and one of the most memorable passages in a book that does not lack for quotable quotes.(it also wasn't that surprising given the staggered bimonthly release of each of the series, which can’t have been good for sales.)but now that they’ve reached their halfway point it’s become clear that not only are the individual series becoming more complex, the connections are increasing exponentially.this is not an abstract problem; this is not somebody else's problem; and those who imply that the british somehow deserved this because they have committed the crime of tolerating muslims have sacrificed the most basic human sympathy for the opportunity to score a cheap and false political point.the multicultural assembly of kids vaguely recalls last issue's century hollow, a tourist attraction in which one hundred animatrons form a demographically accurate representation of the world's population.it's the story of a woman who is arrested for being lesbian, who has her head shoved in a toilet bowl - at least there's no waterboarding, eh? - who is finally subjected to fatal medical experimentation, and who writes a testimony that inspires at least two other prisoners not to give in to the dehumanizations inflicted upon them by their captors.
