better talent is the most important ingredient of better schools.
angela maiers and mike sansone have been of great assistance with this first draft (any mistakes or logic flaws are mine alone!).
similarly, four days ago steve jobs, ceo of apple, noted that textbooks as we know them will disappear.
offer teachers a vast array of occupational opportunities they didn’t have before, encourage a level of entrepeneurialism and individualism among them . . .
as big as the numbers are, the return on this strategic investment would be huge.
north carolina, utah, and alabama also have very robust statewide virtual schools.
it should make for interesting times.
many of my students commented that the depth of interaction in this online class was much greater than most of their traditional courses.
a strategic investment of monies could go a long way toward creating some pedagogically powerful, wonderfully engaging, online multimedia textbooks that then could be used by anyone in the country (or world).
however, the online forums and wikis that i utilized in the dddm class, allowed students to interact with all of their peers, not just a small group.
as you’ll see if you read it for a while, if it has to do with online schooling, you’ll likely find it at michael’s blog.
the quality of teachers would benefit from the increased use of technology in at least two important ways.
whether it’s a statewide virtual school or some other model, we must significantly increase the number of online courses available to iowa students if we are to provide them access to the high-quality learning opportunities envisioned in theiowa core curriculum.
i was delighted to see that bruce started blogging more extensively last fall and was even more pleased when he agreed to join us.
the game requires students to write, create data maps, make timelines, ask questions, make associations, solve problems, etc.
precisely because technology promises to transform the core components of schooling, it is inevitably disruptive to the jobs, routines, and resources of the people whose livelihoods derive from the existing system.
curriki, which is sponsored by sun and has gotten a lot of media attention, so far seems to consist primarily of disparate resources and activities rather than comprehensive, meaningfully-organized textbooks.
to be honest, the two most visible free online textbook initiatives still have a long way to go.
you have to create a culture in your teaching staff where, if they need to know how to blog, they can go online and learn themselves (in communities)
this 12-year-old kid can throw out a question to 1.7 billion people shirky: we are experiencing a tectonic shift in how we form groups and self-organize wesch: this is not simply a technological revolution, this is a cultural revolution.
world see the flat classroom project 2006, 2007, and beyond will collected all of the work that got sent home in his two kids' friday folders for a year; the stack was 2.5 feet tall
it is a fact that the teachers unions have vested interests in preserving the existing educational system, regardless of how poorly it performs.
as online courses become even more prevalent than they are now, colleges and universities either will have to get in the game or be left behind.
this level of computer usage is quite feasible given instructional technology that exists today.
added time for professional development, with proper supervision and accountability, would improve teacher quality.
it cost $1.5 million to develop; costs were shared equally by flvs and 360ed and spread over three years ($250k per partner per year).
as postsecondary faculty members, it behooves us to learn about it and adjust rather than dismissively rejecting the new learning landscape and stubbornly trying to stick to the status quo.
unfortunately,here in iowa we are not keeping pace.
north carolina, utah, and alabama also have very robust statewide virtual schools.
some may oversee or serve as mentors to the front-line teachers themselves.
other districts are finding that online coursework can be an excellent option for at-risk students or credit recovery; for homebound, incarcerated, or home-schooled students; or for meeting the needs of students who simply may not be successful in a more traditional classroom environment.
some may work with students online but still do it in real time.
high schools, with three hours of usage, could reduce staff by up to a half.
i think i can make the first two and would do the third one too if my son didn’t have baseball practice.
a colleague of mine, wary of caving in to students’ demands for online courses, remarked recently that “students demand free beer, too; that doesn’t mean we should give it to them.”
what her academic colleague somehow, incredibly, fails to realize, of course, is thatstudents don’t have to attend his institution .

the author goes into detail regarding all of the problems that she had with the course, including (but not limited to): this faculty member obviously has no idea that 1, 3, and 5 are dependent on how the course and the technology were structured.
the education innovation blog has an interesting post on closed v. open models of education.
meta-analyses of existing research show that student achievement in face-to-face and online courses is approximately equivalent.
this will mean real improvement, and real benefits for the nation and its children.
powerful groups will try to block it.
this constitutes a paradox: as the digital era progresses, learning may be at once more individual (contoured to a person’s own style, proclivities, and interests) yet more social (involving networking, group work, the wisdom of crowds, etc.).
i was delighted to see that bruce started blogging more extensively last fall and was even more pleased when he agreed to join us.
all reports of the week will be listed under the reading category (and, in most instances, theresearch and evaluation category).

as my letter indicates, i think we need something more intentional and systematic.
some may work with students in computer labs, handling much larger classes than today’s teachers do (because the computers are taking over much of the actual teaching).
you have to put yourself out there in ways that people can find you kids are doing this every day without us kids don't care about much of what we have them do in school - it's inauthentic, it lacks meaningful and relevant purpose, it's disconnected and decontextualized mit is offering all of its courses online tough questions from will

nowhere does it say that the software is inadequate or that technology has dubious instructional value.
a robust online learning infrastructure for students makes a lot of sense for the state of iowa (and i’m glad there’sa bill in the iowa house to consider it).
i am a learner in the area of educational gaming so i always gain a lot from john’s posts.

michael posts a lot; the comprehensiveness of information he provides is astounding.
and the most powerful groups in that process are special interests, led by the teachers unions, with a stake in keeping the system as it is. . . .
it is a fact that they are more powerful – by far – than any other groups involved in the politics of education.
there is some really important information and thinking coming out of all three of these channels.
i’m a little bit disoriented but gamely dive in… conspiracy code runs on a custom gaming engine designed specifically for flvs by 360ed.

as the years go by, they will have a harder time generating the solidarity they need to motivate teachers to join, to keep them as members, to mobilize supportive action - and to do the things successful unions need to do if they are to wield power in politics.

when my 30 minutes with julie and andy are up, i’m swooped into that room, replaced by someone else who gets my spot on the flvs couch.
over three or four years, these department-sponsored teams would create 150 to 200 textbooks for common, key courses (e.g., algebra i, physics i, ap english, united states history, 5th grade reading) that are present in nearly every school district nationwide.

there aren't enough educators / policymakers that are looking at the current system of schooling and saying "oh, crap!
theunited states department of education found that four years ago over a third of school districts already had students taking online courses.
you also canfind bruce on twitter.
the most recent data from the international association for k-12 online learning (inacol) show that only a few hundred of the 480,000 k-12 students in iowa are enrolled in online courses.
in essence, students are given an article to read on the computer that’s aligned with their reading level.
students who read one article a week average 102 lexile point gains; students who read two articles per week average 124.
disclosure: i received no incentives from either organization (other than a thumb drive from flvs that contained the above conspiracy code materials) and was not pressured to cover them in any particular way.
the first three already are available: two more reports are coming out this month and next: be sure to tap into the incredible wealth of good information on the reports, research & tools page of the setda web site [warning: it’s easy to get lost in here for hours…].
the program accommodates spanish-speaking students (and, soon, those that speak haitian creole).
this allows low-level readers to still contribute to class discussions.
i think you would take a look at much of what we do in our current schooling system and just toss it and essentially start over.
thenational repository of online courses (nroc) also is doing some interesting work but appears to be complementing, rather than replacing, print textbooks.
education can be freed from geographic constraint.
conspiracy code is designed to be an integrated, full-year course / gaming experience.
clearly this an expensive venture from a raw dollar standpoint, at least to do it well.
[h]owever, technology gives rise to a differentiation of roles among teachers.
good results also are being seen with students with special needs (see, e.g., the arrowhead (wi) schools).
students who read one article a week average 102 lexile point gains; students who read two articles per week average 124.
way back on june 20 i had the pleasure of talking with chris craft about online learning for a class he's taking.
the workgroups create content; post that content online as they go along for review, comment, and input from others; and, over the course of a year, create several units each that add up to a complete, amazing, deep, rich online multimedia textbook.
there is a ‘teaching online 101’ course plus a separate gaming module for conspiracy code.
if elementary students spend but one hour a day learning electronically, certified staff could be reduced by a sixth.
there are no adults right now teaching kids how to learn, not just be social, in these networks video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jufsdn8dsju he assumes there's an audience and that they'll respond
it also has a far-reaching capacity tochange politics - and to eat away, relentlessly and effectively, at the political barriers that have long prevented reform.
schools spend money on a lot of things that they don't need to be buying except in limited numbers: software licenses, textbooks, etc.
however, even if online enrollments in iowa soon will number in the low thousands, the overall availability of online learning opportunities for iowa students still is extremely low.
as postsecondary faculty members, it behooves us to learn about it and adjust rather than dismissively rejecting the new learning landscape and stubbornly trying to stick to the status quo.
julie and andy are talking with someone new on the couch and i’m soon in the hallway, left at last to collect my thoughts.
information and knowledge are absolutely fundamental to what education is all about . . .
maybe we should do this for teachers and administrators too "seventy-one-year-old peggy mcintyre needs to learn as much as she can about windows before 8 a.m.
the remainder of the content was delivered in a similar method as my dddm class with online discussions, wikis and other tech leadership related activities and assignments.
we believe the resistance will be overcome – not simply because technology generates innovations of great value for student learning (which it does), but . . .
if anything is stone-cold certain about the current structure of power, it is that technological change is destined to be resisted by the teachers unions and their allies.
i like how they included a panel session for symposium participants to hear from virtual high school students.
all in all, it appears to be a solid attempt at integrating gaming into the education experience.
otherwise, the university literally won’t have any tuition revenue because its potential students went elsewhere instead.
if you're not uncomfortable right now in education, you're not paying attention conversations are spreading far beyond physical space, in ways that previously were not possible

a robust online learning infrastructure for students makes a lot of sense for the state of iowa (and i’m glad there’sa bill in the iowa house to consider it).
although we can’t share the actual article with you (because it’s currently under review by a journal), chris and sheryl will be giving a presentation on their paper at theucea conference in november which we will try to make available to folks.
the students who seem to like the game the most are the ones who ‘hate history.’
this will mean real improvement, and real benefits for the nation and its children.
students and parents value the flexibility, accessibility, and convenience of online coursework.
if we’re truly honest, we also will recognize that theiowa communications network (icn) is not a viable future option.
other districts are finding that online coursework can be an excellent option for at-risk students or credit recovery; for homebound, incarcerated, or home-schooled students; or for meeting the needs of students who simply may not be successful in a more traditional classroom environment.
sophisticated data systems can put the spotlight on performance [and] make progress (or the lack of it) transparent.
hmmm… i wonder if that means the department is going to narrow down the list of required science standards and also pare down the size of approved textbooks.
it will be interesting to see the evaluation results when they come out.
a few days before necc i was invited by a publicist to interview julie young, the executive director of theflorida virtual school (flvs), and also speak with the folks fromachieve3000.
it will also mean something still more profound: the dawning of a new era in which politics is more open, productive ideas are more likely to flourish – and learning is liberated from the dead hand of the past.
the student reading at first-grade level also is reading the same content as her peer at the ninth-grade level.
the author goes into detail regarding all of the problems that she had with the course, including (but not limited to): there was a ‘lack of immediacy’ in communication; she was ‘only able to introduce students to a limited amount of material outside of the textbook readings;’ it is ‘simply impossible to replicate a lecture online;’ there wasn’t ‘enough time or a proper forum’ to help students ‘develop writing and critical thinking skills or to foster original ideas;’ online courses are too big; she had no time off during the week like she would with a regular 3–hour, once-a-week, face-to-face class; she got too many e-mail messages from students; and she suspected her students didn’t like her very much.
meta-analyses of existing research show that student achievement in face-to-face and online courses is approximately equivalent.
theweb site for the symposium states that the presentations, workshops, lunch, and discussions will explore and inspire strategies about online learning, including math and science, credit recovery, meeting the needs of gifted students, alternative students, remedial education, and increasing access to advanced courses and college prep.
this level of computer usage is quite feasible given instructional technology that exists today.
what her academic colleague somehow, incredibly, fails to realize, of course, is thatstudents don’t have to attend his institution .

if we’re honest with ourselves, we will recognize that most of our school districts will never be able to provide the curricular diversity that most of our graduates need to be effective digital, global workers and citizens.
however, as the course progressed, i was extremely pleased with the level of dialogue and interaction that emerged among the 21 students in the class.

i work with the communications workers of america, on the speed matters project, which scott kindly highlighted as a report of the week.
a recent survey indicated that the two main issues holding back technology use are “it doesn’t fit in the schedule,” and “there is not sufficient time to train teachers.”
the game includes 51 assessments (both oral and written), 270 mini-games, numerous interrogations, 30 ‘agent eliminations,’ and 371 clues.
a few days before necc i was invited by a publicist to interview julie young, the executive director of theflorida virtual school (flvs), and also speak with the folks fromachieve3000.
for many school districts, online courses are the only way to provide high-level classes such as advanced placement, foreign language, advanced science or math, and other courses.
the florida department of education is concerned that students are missing the big picture when it comes to science.
quite informative, but strange nonetheless.
for example, if we want principals to understand the power of blogging, one good way to do that is to show them (and maybe even sign them up for) some blogs that are directly relevant and helpful to their daily work.
" the reality is that the way we've done professional development for the last 30 years doesn't work.
this faculty member obviously has no idea that 1, 3, and 5 are dependent on how the course and the technology were structured.

the first evaluation report on theconspiracy code is due in a couple of weeks but anecdotal evidence looks extremely promising.
each year would see the completion of 50 textbooks.
the icn is a closed, aging network and the course offerings (and monies) there, like everything else in the world, must move to the web.
this is the standard role, common across virtually all teachers, and has allowed for a pervasive sense of occupational sameness that has long been a very good thing for the unions.
i guess she prefers it when her students stay out of touch and don’t try to get their questions answered.

i hope to continue teaching courses under these various modalities: online, blended,and face to face, because they acknowledge interactions needed for effective adult learning while utilizing new technologies to allow some of those interactions to occur from a distance.
it is destined to be a profession that will no longer concentrate teachers in common geographic locations and monopoly employers – and the resulting dispersion of teachers to new locations, combined with the diversity of employers that goes along with it, cannot help but create additional layers of differentiation that affect how teachers see their own interests.

this is because the vast majority of educators aren't information literate themselves
a strategic investment by the department could make an extremely powerful contribution to the k-12 educational landscape and would be a powerful lever toward ensuring that all students had access to top-quality, engaging learning materials.
some ‘barriers’ were put in place to ensure that students didn’t play more than work (e.g., students can’t move forward until they work on their data map, write in their journal, get feedback from their teacher, etc.).

textbook content would be refreshed every three or four years to ensure content relevance and usage of the latest digital technologies.
many online courses also allow students to proceed at their own pace; collaborate with students from other schools or countries; and/or incorporate digital technologies into their learning.
there is little to no difference in reading experience; it’s actually fairly difficult to tell at a glance at what level another student is working.
[w]e believe that we are only at the beginning of the web’s impact on the fundamental structure of education.
a colleague of mine, wary of caving in to students’ demands for online courses, remarked recently that “students demand free beer, too; that doesn’t mean we should give it to them.”
most students spend about an hour a day working for the class, some of which is in the game environment.
federal provision of these textbooks would free states and school districts to spend funds on laptops, classroom-level high-speed wireless connectivity, and other technologies necessary to ensure the global competitiveness of our students in the decades to come.
in why the flow of innovation has reversed, they note: [t]he vector of innovation has changed.
even after investing in hardware and software, which are trivial compared to the cost of teachers, schools would have funds from staff savings to increase teacher pay and to provide more time for teacher training and planning.

for $200 million per year, the department could create phenomenal, mind-blowing online multimedia textbooks that could be used by students all across the country.

i think i can make the first two and would do the third one too if my son didn’t have baseball practice.

i have seen many of my own colleagues successfully transition to on-line learning.
this week's report is from education sector: here's a quote from the report: there has been no shortage of solutions for improving the nation’s public schools.
disempowered tomorrow i left this comment at jim gates’ tipline blog: students who aren't fluid technology users today will be the low-wage workers and disempowered citizens of tomorrow.
the program accommodates spanish-speaking students (and, soon, those that speak haitian creole).
for example, scott mcnealy, chairman of the board for sun microsystems, said last june that 'technology trumps the textbook.'
next steps for the company are to 1) create a number of specific science units, and 2) identify and/or write articles that target specific career clusters and can be aligned with theworkkeys job skill assessment program.
i am sending this letter to encourage the department to make a relatively small, but extremely strategic, investment that would pay enormous dividends for our nation’s elementary and secondary students.
will richardson notes: [a] school superintendent i spoke with … lamented the fact that his it staff wouldn’t give him access to youtube and even wikipedia.
well, we will be shifting a couple of our existing blogs over to wordpress, so you’ll see some visual changes and added functionality in the next few months.
many online courses also allow students to proceed at their own pace; collaborate with students from other schools or countries; and/or incorporate digital technologies into their learning.
expected student growth in a year is 46 lexile points.
they dip in and out of the gaming engine throughout the year, assembling clues and completing missions.
there is little to no difference in reading experience; it’s actually fairly difficult to tell at a glance at what level another student is working.
most students spend about an hour a day working for the class, some of which is in the game environment.
as sameness and solidarity decline, so too will their political power.
once created, these textbooks then could be hosted by the department, state departments of education, and other entities or could be downloaded for hosting on local school district servers.
i can guarantee that you’ll learn a lot and gain some valuable resources for your own work.

nowhere does it say that the software is inadequate or that technology has dubious instructional value.
after 101 views, he had 10 comments (10% hit rate); all 10 had specific feedback/suggestions for him
and all of this promotes solidarity, which is critical to the unions’ ability to attract members, gain their financial and emotional support, and mobilize them for economic and political ends.
students and parents value the flexibility, accessibility, and convenience of online coursework.
our research shows that even people who don't want broadband for themselves have a vague idea that it is important for kids and schools and the future of education.
added pay would help attract and retain better talent.
i was somewhat trepidatious, wondering how i might engage students as meaningfully as i had within a classroom setting.
created byintermediate district 287 in minnesota, which heads up the northern star online collaborative, the video features mike smart, 2007 minnesota teacher of the year, and a number of other minnesota educators and students.
a recent survey indicated that the two main issues holding back technology use are “it doesn’t fit in the schedule,” and “there is not sufficient time to train teachers.”
average gains in one year for esl/ell students are 166 lexile points (compared to 27 points expected).
and it is a fact that in a government of checks and balances they can use their power to block or weaken most reforms they do not like.
if we’re truly honest, we also will recognize that theiowa communications network (icn) is not a viable future option.
precisely because technology promises to transform the core components of schooling, it is inevitably disruptive to the jobs, routines, and resources of the people whose livelihoods derive from the existing system.
[and see] the same basic pattern as for virtual schools – which is telling, as virtual schools and teacher identifiers have little to do with one another aside from their impact on union interests” (pp. 138–139).
and the most powerful groups in that process are special interests, led by the teachers unions, with a stake in keeping the system as it is. . . .
[t]he idea is to minimize all sources of differentiation, because they undermine the common interests and solidarity that so contribute to union success. . . .
students can have more interaction with . . .
the game includes 51 assessments (both oral and written), 270 mini-games, numerous interrogations, 30 ‘agent eliminations,’ and 371 clues.
the teams could be comprised as follows: four teachers plus a professor plus two programmers equals a workgroup; four workgroups per team.
technological change will run into the same political roadblocks that all major reforms have run into, and for exactly the same reasons.
they dip in and out of the gaming engine throughout the year, assembling clues and completing missions.
there is some really important information and thinking coming out of all three of these channels.
teachers can be freed from their tradition-bound classroom roles, employed in more differentiated and productive ways, and offered new career paths.

however, even if online enrollments in iowa soon will number in the low thousands, the overall availability of online learning opportunities for iowa students still is extremely low.
in short, i believe i was treated much like any media representative, despite being ‘just a blogger.’
we are in the initial stages of gathering real stories about how universal, affordable broadband can make a real difference.
at the middle school level, two hours a day with computers would reduce staff requirements by a third.
i am very interested in the challenge of articulating the vision as well.
it is a fact that the teachers unions have vested interests in preserving the existing educational system, regardless of how poorly it performs.
all flvs teachers receive extensive professional development before they’re allowed to teach.
i accepted because i’ve always wanted the chance to talk with julie.
two primarily online universities and one community college among the top five.
for example, even though the article text and corresponding assignments are geared to students’ individual reading level, the overall layout of the article, font size, graphics, etc.

and all of this promotes solidarity, which is critical to the unions’ ability to attract members, gain their financial and emotional support, and mobilize them for economic and political ends.
unfortunately,here in iowa we are not keeping pace.
[h]owever, technology gives rise to a differentiation of roles among teachers.
this is the standard role, common across virtually all teachers, and has allowed for a pervasive sense of occupational sameness that has long been a very good thing for the unions.
going forward, learning may be far more individualized, far more in the hands (and the minds) of the learner, and far more interactive than ever before.
- teachers can be freed from their tradition-bound classroom roles, employed in more differentiated and productive ways, and offered new career paths.
as always, we're interested in your nominations for interviewees.
offer teachers a vast array of occupational opportunities they didn’t have before, encourage a level of entrepeneurialism and individualism among them . .
research shows that the online predation issue is not nearly as big as we think; the threat is overblown; we've been datelined to death; and that most kids are pretty good at navigating the web safely
some may work with students in computer labs, handling much larger classes than today’s teachers do (because the computers are taking over much of the actual teaching).
see also my older post: principal blogging not allowed.
this allows low-level readers to still contribute to class discussions.

bruce is a fantastic scholar.
theunited states department of education found that four years ago over a third of school districts already had students taking online courses.
i accepted because i’ve always wanted the chance to talk with julie.
all textbook material would be free and openly accessible to our nation’s k-12 students and educators.
i want my kid to fail safely in the vicinity of some responsible adult that can help her recognize the ramifications of the mistakes that she is making it can't all happen at school (dave keane).
it also has a far-reaching capacity tochange politics - and to eat away, relentlessly and effectively, at the political barriers that have long prevented reform.
the federal government clearly has the money to pull this kind of thing off.
added time for professional development, with proper supervision and accountability, would improve teacher quality.
even after investing in hardware and software, which are trivial compared to the cost of teachers, schools would have funds from staff savings to increase teacher pay and to provide more time for teacher training and planning.
those of us in educational leadership academic circles know that bruce is not afraid to take on the establishment and confront uncomfortable political and educational truths.
- parents can readily be included in the communications loop.
average gains in one year for esl/ell students are 166 lexile points (compared to 27 points expected).
a task force stated that “teachers should provide a broader focus on scientific concepts and process in a 'big picture' sense.”
in short, i believe i was treated much like any media representative, despite being ‘just a blogger.’
it is destined to be a profession that will no longer concentrate teachers in common geographic locations and monopoly employers – and the resulting dispersion of teachers to new locations, combined with the diversity of employers that goes along with it, cannot help but create additional layers of differentiation that affect how teachers see their own interests.

i’m a little bit disoriented but gamely dive in… conspiracy code runs on a custom gaming engine designed specifically for flvs by 360ed.
as online courses become even more prevalent than they are now, colleges and universities either will have to get in the game or be left behind.
my preferred teaching mode is probably a blended approach.
[t]he pervasive sameness that the unions have always counted on will slowly fall apart.
if elementary students spend but one hour a day learning electronically, certified staff could be reduced by a sixth.
we now can live stream video from our phones; imagine a world in 5 years where everyone's phone is iphonish justin bieber became famous by uploading his talent show videos to the web check out surfthechannel.com today, instead of writing a letter to the editor / better business bureau / ceo,you make a video business is different today because people can form groups, allstate (and others) has hired people to monitor the twittersphere; don't call; tweet!
in a "good" face-to-face class meeting (like the one that i led tonight), students may deeply engage in discussions with four or five other peers, and may hear other classmates share out briefly in a whole group setting.
the nextconspiracy code game will target reading and comes out in august.
i can guarantee that you’ll learn a lot and gain some valuable resources for your own work.
the most recent data from the international association for k-12 online learning (inacol) show that only a few hundred of the 480,000 k-12 students in iowa are enrolled in online courses.
class of 2020 action plan for education project is releasing its reports.
conspiracy code is designed to be an integrated, full-year course / gaming experience.
for example, even though the article text and corresponding assignments are geared to students’ individual reading level, the overall layout of the article, font size, graphics, etc.
the student reading at first-grade level also is reading the same content as her peer at the ninth-grade level.
high schools, with three hours of usage, could reduce staff by up to a half.
technological change will run into the same political roadblocks that all major reforms have run into, and for exactly the same reasons.
historical facts are interwoven throughout the gaming experience and student-teacher discussion.
and it is a fact that in a government of checks and balances they can use their power to block or weaken most reforms they do not like.
[t]he pervasive sameness that the unions have always counted on will slowly fall apart.
in essence, students are given an article to read on the computer that’s aligned with their reading level.
while i am a huge advocate for technology, i still believe in the power of personal interaction and the synergy that can emerge from a group of people deeply engaged in group discussions and activities.
since postsecondary students vote with their feet and their pocketbooks, the institution does indeed have to give students online courses if that’s what they want.
for many school districts, online courses are the only way to provide high-level classes such as advanced placement, foreign language, advanced science or math, and other courses.
i put in much time preparing for the course and establishing expectations and norms to create a community of learners.
as you’ll see if you read it for a while, if it has to do with online schooling, you’ll likely find it at michael’s blog.
michael also maintains avirtual schooling wiki or you can follow him on twitter.
when my 30 minutes with julie and andy are up, i’m swooped into that room, replaced by someone else who gets my spot on the flvs couch.
1a: share the story of what it could look like for kids, lots of meetings with stakeholders, showed videos/inspiring tool usage by educators, visited other places, created cognitive disconnects, built partnerships with business/industry 1b: has to be an ongoing process/conversation 2b: making videocasts, using ipod touches for teacher observation/evaluation, moved to google docs, using digital discussion forums, using blogs/wikis/etherpad, school board is now paperless 2e: working with setda or inacol, being active in the blogosphere
all are extremely similar to what other higher-level readers in the class are experiencing.
since postsecondary students vote with their feet and their pocketbooks, the institution does indeed have to give students online courses if that’s what they want.
julie and andy are talking with someone new on the couch and i’m soon in the hallway, left at last to collect my thoughts.

fyi, theuniversity of phoenix has more than twice the number of students (117,309) as any of the next four (which range from 54,169 to 50,663).
if the textbooks were wiki-based, much of the content could be revised and updated even before their refresh cycle came due.
those of us in educational leadership academic circles know that bruce is not afraid to take on the establishment and confront uncomfortable political and educational truths.
keep giving us feedback and let us know what you think.
turning to the national educational technology standards for administrators (nets-a).
parents can readily be included in the communications loop.
- education can be freed from geographic constraint.
imagine 50 teams, each made up of individuals who took a paid sabbatical for one year, working to create rigorous, standards-based, online textbooks that included text, graphics, electronic presentations, audio, video, simulations, learning games, interactive problem-solving and review activities, etc.
there sure are a lot of faculty who teach online and also have students who like them.
better talent is the most important ingredient of better schools.
