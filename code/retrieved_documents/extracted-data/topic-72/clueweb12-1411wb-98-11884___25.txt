as big as the numbers are, the return on this strategic investment would be huge.

north carolina, utah, and alabama also have very robust statewide  virtual schools.
it should  make for interesting times.
many of my students commented that the depth of interaction in this online class was much greater than most of their traditional courses.
or they might think about the online training that occurs in many workplaces.
a strategic investment of monies could go a long way toward creating some pedagogically powerful, wonderfully engaging, online multimedia textbooks that then could be used by anyone in the country (or world).
however, the online forums and wikis that i utilized in the dddm class, allowed students to interact with all of their peers, not just a small group.
as you’ll see if  you read it for a while, if it has to do with online schooling, you’ll  likely find it at michael’s blog.
hope to see some of you participate in  at least one of these!

the world is about networks right now (how can i get the answer i need  when i need it?), it's not about textbooks and memorization check out fanfiction.net to get a sense of user-generated communities we're preparing kids for a world in which they're going to be googled over  and over again in their lives
it's a basic risk-reward equation adults are not having these conversations with kids, they're simply  blocking and/or ignoring the issue just like we have driver's ed, we need internet ed
whether it’s a statewide virtual school or some other model, we must significantly increase the number of online courses available to iowa students if we are to provide them access to the high-quality learning opportunities envisioned in theiowa core curriculum.
i was delighted to see that bruce started blogging more extensively  last fall and was even more pleased when he agreed to join us.
the  game requires students to write, create data maps, make timelines, ask  questions, make associations, solve problems, etc.
all of this is in contrast to schools’ typical practice of  having separate books or textbooks – often on separate topics – or  pullout programs for struggling readers.
precisely because technology promises to transform the core components of schooling, it is inevitably disruptive to the jobs, routines, and resources of the people whose livelihoods derive from the existing system.
curriki, which is sponsored by sun and has gotten a lot of media attention, so far seems to consist primarily of disparate resources and activities rather than comprehensive, meaningfully-organized textbooks.

meta-analyses of  existing research show that student achievement in face-to-face and online  courses is approximately equivalent.
students take about 90 to 100 hours to complete the game.
this will mean real improvement, and real benefits for the nation and its children.
powerful groups will try to block it.
collaboration is everywhere.
this constitutes a paradox: as the digital  era progresses, learning may be at once more individual (contoured to a  person’s own style, proclivities, and interests) yet more social  (involving networking, group work, the wisdom of crowds, etc.).
i was delighted to see that bruce started blogging more extensively last fall and was even more pleased when he agreed to join us.
all reports of the week will be listed under the reading category (and, in most instances, theresearch and evaluation category).
several other  districts are piloting it.
otherwise, the  university literally won’t have any tuition revenue because its  potential students went elsewhere instead.

[okay, calling these faculty members stupid probably is a little harsh.
as my letter indicates, i think we need something more intentional and systematic.
some may work with students in computer labs, handling much larger classes than today’s teachers do (because the computers are taking over much of the actual teaching).
i think this is a powerful, transformative idea whose time has come
in other words, what would it take to get from our current system of schooling to a robust, province- or statewide system of 21st century learning?
you have to put yourself out there in ways that people can find you kids are doing this every day without us kids don't care about much of what we have them do in school - it's  inauthentic, it lacks meaningful and relevant purpose, it's disconnected and  decontextualized mit is offering all of its courses online tough questions from will

some may work with students online but still do it in real  time.
sometimes the game requires students  to do outside research to complete assignments and proceed forward.
just look around right now and see the trends that  already are happening and just project those out and see that it’s going  to be a very different world.

michael posts a lot; the  comprehensiveness of information he provides is astounding.
and  the most powerful groups in that process are special interests, led by the  teachers unions, with a stake in keeping the system as it is. . . .
if folks aren't at the table, get them there!
it is a  fact that they are more powerful – by far – than any other groups  involved in the politics of education.
there is some really important information and thinking coming out of all three of these channels.
i’m a little bit disoriented but gamely dive in… conspiracy code runs on a custom gaming engine designed specifically for flvs by 360ed.

whether we want it to or not, the paradigm shift is occurring around us  every day.
do you have a curriculum that supports the things that will is talking  about?
as the years go by, they will have a harder time generating the  solidarity they need to motivate teachers to join, to keep them as members, to  mobilize supportive action - and to do the things successful unions need  to do if they are to wield power in politics.

entities such asiowa learning online, the iowa online ap academy, and kirkwood community college’s high school distance learning program all are delivering courses to students.

technology, then, is a double-barreled agent of change.

we've made teachers as passive about learning as kids - kids wait for  teachers to tell them how/what to learn; teachers wait for us to tell them  how/what to learn nsdc agrees: it should be long-term, job-embedded professional development  that really shifts practice
i’m handed another  publicity packet, do the quick meet-and-greet, and away we go… achieve3000 is a ‘differentiated instruction solution.’
this past spring i taught my first completely on-line course - "data-driven decision making".

if you’ve got  some other suggestions for us, or know of a blog that might be a good addition  to our portfolio, let me know!
the brains behind the math?
if elementary students spend but one hour a day learning electronically, certified staff could be reduced by a sixth.
a promising complement to face-to-face mentoring may be found in the innovative use of computer-mediated communications, such as online forums.
here’s my favorite statement i made in the video (at 7:20): one of the things i think we have to ask ourselves as school leaders is ‘what’s our moral imperative to prepare kids for a digital, global age?’
there are no adults right now teaching kids how to learn, not just be  social, in these networks video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jufsdn8dsju he assumes there's an audience and that they'll respond
it  also has a far-reaching capacity tochange politics - and to eat away,  relentlessly and effectively, at the political barriers that have long  prevented reform.
schools spend money on a lot of things that they don't need to be buying  except in limited numbers: software licenses, textbooks, etc.
but online learning opportunities occur in the k-12 sector as well and are increasingly popular with students and their families.
however, even if online enrollments in iowa soon will number in  the low thousands, the overall availability of online learning  opportunities for iowa students still is extremely low.
as postsecondary faculty members, it behooves us to learn about it and adjust rather than dismissively rejecting the new learning landscape and stubbornly trying to stick to the status quo.
i would like to publicly thank the other practitioners and academics who took the time out of their extremely busy schedules to participate in the anonymous review process this year: the technology leadership research award is jointly sponsored by castle and the ucea school technology leadership special interest group.

as i walk toward the elevator to return to my own hotel room, i’m left with one thought:man, was that strange.
(p. 149) traditionally, teachers have taught students face-to-face in classrooms.
julie and andy are talking with someone new on the couch and i’m soon in the hallway, left at last to collect my thoughts.
our blogs here are the blogs that we’ve initiated to date (and their topical  focus): dangerously irrelevant (technology, leadership, and school reform)
information and knowledge are absolutely fundamental to what education is all about . . .
maybe we should do this for teachers and administrators too "seventy-one-year-old peggy mcintyre needs to learn as much as she can about windows before 8 a.m.
the remainder of the content was delivered in a similar method as my dddm class with online discussions, wikis and other tech leadership related activities and assignments.
some may engage in distance learning but do it asynchronously . . .
“if institutional education refuses to adapt to the landscape of the information age, it will die and should die.”
part of the fun at this year's t+l conference!
we believe the resistance will be overcome – not simply because technology generates innovations of great value for student learning (which it does), but . . .
for what it’s worth, beth, here is what i’d talk about: posted by scott mcleod on july 27, 2007 in communication, law, policy, and ethics, leadership and vision, online learning, planning and funding, tech integration | permalink | comments (0) | trackback (1) technorati tags: access, broadband, communication, connection, cwa, digital ,divide, ftth, leadership, mcleod, online, technology
if anything is stone-cold certain about the current structure of power, it  is that technological change is destined to be resisted by the teachers unions  and their allies.
i like how they included a panel session for symposium participants to hear from virtual high school students.
registration is limited to 150 participants.
issues 2 and 6  seem to be the result of her own decision-making, not any inherent flaw in  online instruction.
the [dayton view academy and dayton academy]  charter schools . . .
all in all, it appears to be a solid  attempt at integrating gaming into the education experience.
otherwise, the university literally won’t have any tuition revenue because its potential students went elsewhere instead.
we need to stop  tinkering.
the florida virtual school offers almost 100 online courses and is expected to serve more than 80,000 students this year.
the new york city and miami-dade school districts (as  well as the state of hawaii) are using achieve3000.
if you're not uncomfortable right now in education, you're not paying  attention conversations are spreading far beyond physical space, in ways that  previously were not possible
that have data systems with the capacity to link students and teachers . . .
my learning today looks nothing like the learning that's occurring my  kids' classrooms
this represents approximately 2% of  the national k-12 public school student population and is a 22–fold  increase since 2000.about 20 states have statewide virtual high schools that  deliver online courses to students across the state.
entities such asiowa learning online, the  iowa online ap academy, and kirkwood community college’s high school  distance learning program all are delivering courses to students.
it’s hard for me to be sympathetic regarding issue 7:my students contacted me too much and asked me too many questions!

so might a consortium of states or maybe a large private foundation.
a robust online learning infrastructure for students makes a lot of  sense for the state of iowa (and i’m glad there’sa bill in the iowa  house to consider it).

the students who  seem to like the game the most are the ones who ‘hate history.’
here’s my favorite statement i made in the video (at 7:20): one of the things i think we have to ask ourselves as school leaders  is ‘what’s our moral imperative to prepare kids for a  digital, global age?’
there are  too many options available to students for anything else to occur.
this will mean real improvement, and real benefits for the nation and its  children.
it is simply to recognize the political world as it is.

some may work mainly with parents, monitoring student progress and assuring proper student oversight.
other districts are finding that online coursework can be an excellent option for at-risk students or credit recovery; for homebound, incarcerated, or home-schooled students; or for meeting the needs of students who simply may not be successful in a more traditional classroom environment.

hmmm… i wonder if that means the department is going to narrow down the list of required science standards and also pare down the size of approved textbooks.
so the  question for school leaders and for policymakers is ‘how brave are  you and how visionary are you going to be?’
what if every teacher and administrator also had to participate in at least one high-quality online professional development experience every three years or so?
here are some representative posts to get you started: 6.
it will be  interesting to see the evaluation results when they come out.
a few days before necc i was invited by a publicist to interview julie  young, the executive director of theflorida virtual school (flvs), and  also speak with the folks fromachieve3000.
two of the three blogs have been in existence for a long while; the third is a new blog by a faculty colleague.
it will also mean something still more profound: the dawning of a new era in which politics is more open, productive ideas are more likely to flourish – and learning is liberated from the dead hand of the past.
the student reading at  first-grade level also is reading the same content as her peer at the  ninth-grade level.
flvs is a  data-driven organization and is committed to reworking the game/course as need  be to ensure students are both engaged and learning whatever facts they need  for success in the standardized-testing era.
the author goes into  detail regarding all of the problems that she had with the  course, including (but not limited to): there was a ‘lack of immediacy’ in communication; she was ‘only able to introduce students to a limited amount of  material outside of the textbook readings;’ it is ‘simply impossible to replicate a lecture online;’ there wasn’t ‘enough time or a proper forum’ to help  students ‘develop writing and critical thinking skills or to foster  original ideas;’ online courses are too big; she had no time off during the week like she would with a regular  3–hour, once-a-week, face-to-face class; she got too many e-mail messages from students; and she suspected her students didn’t like her very much.
meta-analyses of existing research show that student achievement in face-to-face and online courses is approximately equivalent.
some supports need to be in place to facilitate effective implementation… part 2 marketing there’s also a marketing piece to this.
finally, can she really blame issue 8 on the fact that the instruction was  ‘online?’

theweb site for the symposium states that the presentations, workshops, lunch, and discussions will explore and inspire strategies about online learning, including math and science, credit recovery, meeting the needs of gifted students, alternative students, remedial education, and increasing access to advanced courses and college prep.
this  level of computer usage is quite feasible given instructional technology that  exists today.
what her academic colleague somehow, incredibly, fails to realize, of  course, is thatstudents don’t have to attend his institution .
schools have a lot of tech, but nothing's really different still memorizing a lot of stuff curriculum hasn't changed
teachers and students who  may be thousands of miles away or from different nations or cultures.
issue 4 doesn’t make any sense to me; didn’t she have the same number of weeks as for her other courses?
if we’re honest with ourselves, we will recognize  that most of our school districts will never be able to provide the curricular  diversity that most of our graduates need to be effective digital, global  workers and citizens.
we gotta rethink "do your own work."
as they say, “it’s gonna be awesome.
two of the three blogs have been  in existence for a long while; the third is a new blog by a faculty colleague.
and it would be impossible for the information revolution to unfold andnot have transformative implications for how children can be educated and how schools and teachers can more productively do their jobs. . . .
however, as the course progressed, i was extremely pleased with the level of dialogue and interaction that emerged among the 21 students in the class.

i have known dr. bruce baker, school finance professor extraordinaire, for  many years.
there are numerous high-quality resources available for k-12 educational technology advocates and change agents, including the 2007 report,maximizing the impact: the pivotal role of technology in a 21st century education system.

i work with the communications workers of america, on the speed matters project, which scott kindly highlighted as a report of the week.
a recent survey indicated that the two main issues holding back technology use are “it doesn’t fit in the schedule,” and “there is not sufficient time to train teachers.”
i’ll have to catch it on replay.
today’s post concerns online learning opportunities for students.
the game includes 51 assessments (both oral and written), 270 mini-games, numerous interrogations, 30 ‘agent eliminations,’ and 371 clues.
a few days before necc i was invited by a publicist to interview julie young, the executive director of theflorida virtual school (flvs), and also speak with the folks fromachieve3000.
i encourage you to subscribe to all three of these blogs for a while.
the florida  virtual school offers almost 100 online courses and is expected to serve more  than 80,000 students this year.
the same cannot be said of the traditional “technology” of education - teachers and classrooms - unless that world changes fundamentally.
can you imagine how fiscally and educationally empowering it would be for schools to have free and open access to 150 to 200 high-quality online multimedia textbooks created by the top experts in the country?
today, it is the reverse.
and i hope someone besides me will think big and make this happen.
for many school districts, online courses are the only way to provide high-level classes such as advanced placement, foreign language, advanced science or math, and other courses.
archimedes said “give me a lever long enough and i can move the  world.”
the florida department of education is concerned that students are missing the big picture when it comes to science.
quite informative, but strange nonetheless.
great care has been taken to avoid stigmatization of low-level readers.
we expect much of that change to be away from the existing educational institutions and towards empowering individuals and newly-formed groups.
for example, if we want principals to understand the power of blogging, one good way to do that is to show them (and maybe even sign them up for) some blogs that are directly relevant and helpful to their daily work.
are you literate  according to ncte?
" the reality is that the way we've done professional development for the  last 30 years doesn't work.
this faculty member obviously has no idea that 1, 3, and 5 are dependent on  how the course and the technology were structured.
it is a fact that they are more powerful – by far – than any other groups involved in the politics of education.
[t]he idea is  to minimize all sources of differentiation, because they undermine the common  interests and solidarity that so contribute to union success. . . .

this is the standard role, common across virtually all teachers, and has allowed for a pervasive sense of occupational sameness that has long been a very good thing for the unions.
i guess she prefers it when her students stay out of touch and don’t try to get their questions answered.
- schools can be operated at lower cost, relying more on technology (which is relatively cheap) and less on labor (which is relatively expensive). . . .

florida recently passed a law  requiring every school district to provide online courses (either itself  or by contracting with others) for its k-8 students.
but i'll admit it's been a bit nippy here lately.
the teams could be comprised as follows: four teachers plus a professor plus two programmers equals a workgroup; four workgroups per team.
technological change will run into the same political  roadblocks that all major reforms have run into, and for exactly the same  reasons.
they dip in and out of the gaming engine throughout the year, assembling clues and completing missions.
there  is some really important information and thinking coming out of all  three of these channels.
teachers can be freed from their tradition-bound classroom roles, employed  in more differentiated and productive ways, and offered new career paths.

however, even if online enrollments in iowa soon will number in the low thousands, the overall availability of online learning opportunities for iowa students still is extremely low.

the company recommends a minimum of 1 or 2 articles a week but there are articles available every day if desired.
in short, i believe i was treated much like any media  representative, despite being ‘just a blogger.’
it is destined to be a profession that will no longer concentrate teachers in  common geographic locations and monopoly employers – and the resulting  dispersion of teachers to new locations, combined with the diversity of  employers that goes along with it, cannot help but create additional layers of  differentiation that affect how teachers see their own interests.

i’m a little bit disoriented but  gamely dive in… conspiracy code runs on a custom gaming engine designed  specifically for flvs by 360ed.
as online courses become even more prevalent than they are now, colleges and universities either will have to get in the game or be left behind.

in  essence, students are given an article to read on the computer that’s  aligned with their reading level.

it's early in the game, though.
although a few organizations (e.g., wikibooks or curriki) are attempting to create free online textbooks or learning materials, their reliance on volunteers has resulted in relatively little progress.
what choice do we have?
since postsecondary students vote with their feet and their pocketbooks, the institution does indeed have to give students online courses if that’s what they want.
for many school districts, online courses are the only  way to provide high-level classes such as advanced placement, foreign  language, advanced science or math, and other courses.
i put in much time preparing for the course and establishing expectations and norms to create a community of learners.
it’s hard for  me to be sympathetic regarding issue 7:my students contacted me too much  and asked me too many questions!
it’s now a publish-then-filter world.
