i can’t imagine how many people were on the fence, but saw a video like this or read some paper where kids came out on top… in classroom learning, and decided from that to give up, even though they have many many advantages the kids don’t.

embarrassment is a prime motivating factor for human beings (i owe this insight to marvin minsky’s the society of mind, but it was most memorably expressed by david berlinski (in black mischief, p. 129), who noted that of all emotions, from rage to depression to first love, only embarrassment can recur, decades later, with its full original intensity).

i realize that you don’t like to put yourself in situations like number 3, but living in a foreign country, i find that even as an adult, i get #3 from time to time.
