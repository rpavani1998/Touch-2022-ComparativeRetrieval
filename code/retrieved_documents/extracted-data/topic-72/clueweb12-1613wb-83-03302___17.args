at home, you need a good-sized d-ring binder, like this, with ordinary paper dividers to mirror the dividers in the traveling binder.
given that the notebook system they’ve chosen is even worse than i’d feared (i might even need to do another rant!), let’s just say i’m a bit skeptical.
of course, sometimes that planning is itself a nontrivial task — in fact, it’s the first task in the assignment, and should probably be done as soon as possible.
when i’m handling one good-sized project with a bunch of different facets to it (e.g., job search), i have a 13-pocket accordion folder, made of durable plastic, likethis one.
similarly, kids who enter a lot of exhibits in the fair (and many kids enter several dozen items) have to handle the organizational overhead (paperwork, entry slips, explanatory cards, etc) themselves.
ideally, i would want to hear someone spontaneously identify issues of social isolation, intense imaginations and emotions, and asynchrony between cognitive and emotional development, as all being relevant things to think about when working with gifted folks.
what i do like to see kids have around is some way of writing in color, whether that be colored pencils or colored pens.
but, as i tell my own kids, unless something is bleeding or on fire, chances are good that this isn’t an emergency.
by the way, i have known some school-age kids to use an accordion file instead of the traveling zip binder, where each section is a class, and there’s one section at the front for hot-folder items.
but the fact is,all kids need some adult direction early inany process, and that direction needs to be faded gradually over time.
however, if that’s a problem area, then it needs to get explicitly cued and practiced specifically until it becomes part of the pcd-use routine.
i’d be a good grantwriter, i suppose, but ugh, not what i want to actually do for a living.
if you get push-back instead of thoughtful dialogue, just thank them nicely and walk.
reading biographies of famous individuals, particularly those written for younger audiences, doesn’t help all that much, i’m afraid.
4 single-subject spiral notebooks that measure 9″x11″ (with, i kid you not, seven (7) reminders, four (4) of which are boldfaced and underlined, one (1) of which also has italics, to make sure you notice that they are requiring you to track down spirals that are actually 9″x11″ rather than 8.5″x11″ or 8.5″x10.5″, despite the fact that these spirals are literally three times the cost of the normal ones and are considerably harder to find (yes, i found them, no need to send me a link)).
if you ever spot it outside one of those places, it needs to get put back in one of its permissible “homes” right away.
there is a nice public speaking program — kids prepare 3-10-minute talks on any topic they like, with posters and 3-d objects, kind of like show and tell on steroids.
i can’t say as i’ve found a bulletproof system for keeping track of tasks (what needs to be done) and time (when it will be done and when it will be completed), but let me at least raise the issues i think need to be considered in the process.
not every kid has easy access to a family friend who just happens to be in your field.)
and don’t worry about that “social-emotional” thing, or the one story they can tell you about the kid who accelerated and was miserable — the most important social-emotional need for gifted kids is appropriate academic challenge and real peers.
these are a must for physics or any other course involving diagrams, and really useful for a lot of note-taking enterprises.
but if you feel that a kid shouldn’t be present in their own iep meetings by the mid to late teenage years, chances are good that you also need to be thinking about legal guardianship or conservatorship in adulthood.
the goal is not to get our kids (or us!) to act like everyone else.
ideally, i would want to hear someone spontaneously identify issues of social isolation, intense imaginations and emotions, and asynchrony between cognitive and emotional development, as all being relevant things to think about when working with gifted folks.
also, have available at home a small box of page protectors, preferably matte-finish ones.
the day-to-day job of a scientist — a real one — isn’t too different from that of, say, an insurance claims adjuster.
i’m noticing what’s not on the list, too… no mechanical pencils.
if you’re using portable pockets, you might be able to get away with color-coding (i do — i usually have some mnemonic association between the color and the project, and that’s enough for me).
but the fact is,all kids need some adult direction early inany process, and that direction needs to be faded gradually over time.
the nice thing about this system is that any member of the family can make changes which then everyone can see, and any member of the family can create an appointment for anyone else — i can let little bird know that we have company coming on a certain evening, so she can’t count on homework help then, for example.
then, if necessary, we teach a parent how to watch and cue them, and they do it before our session, so my weekly check is just to see that it’s been done correctly.
the courses are generally terrific, and the chance to be with other gifted kids is one that many kids treasure.
however, particularly as we make it into adulthood — and i’m willing to bet that there are some homeschoolers or afterschoolers who would also be in this boat — things are often organized less around routine stuff happening every day or week, and more around discreteprojects.
the lists are *very* helpful for parents to get advice and feedback from each other, and even just to have a place to talk about what they’re going through without being assumed to be bragging.
but it didn’t help with the basic problem that most therapists think theydo get it (an example of the dunning-kruger effect, where the lack of knowledge and metacognitive skills in a domain interferes with accurate self-assessment of skill in a domain — basically, if you don’t know what you don’t know, you don’t know that you don’t know it).
what i do like to see kids have around is some way of writing in color, whether that be colored pencils or colored pens.
see, some of us have brains that, well, we think best in piles and networks.
today’s science demonstration will require a laptop, a printer, and 20 liters of coffee.
accordion files, of course, have those little divider tabs.
workaround for paper:  try preprinting some small stickers with typically-used words (e.g. “test”) and stapling those to the inside cover.
but if you’re not entering it immediately, it needs to actually physically be put in the capture inbox, and it must get emptied into the real system with everything else.
if you’re a moveable feast, then you need something portable.
if you would like to use a paper system, i’d recommend something like a dayrunner or franklin planner, which allows you to customize sheet types and to keep adding new sheets and retiring old sheets as you go.
i have particular expertise in cognitive, academic, and psychological assessment, the psychological and social effects of high intelligence, theories of intelligence and personality, and the real world of various educational strategies.
good carry-around pockets are good for about an inch or two of paper, which handles quite a wide variety of projects.
so teach them to write an assignment for, e.g., ”schedule time to work on book report,” the day the book report is assigned.
as i feared, little bird’s middle school has handed out their official agenda book that they plan to periodically check that the kids are using the way they have decided is the one right way.
it’s a plan for lost and crumpled papers, shoveddeep into the recesses of the backpack until they turn into petroleum products.
try to find highlighters that aren’t fluorescent (= superstimulating).
properly handled, having kids participate in their own meetings can contribute to their own maturational process.
enter the pile-containment devices: letter trays, portable pockets, accordion folders, and the like.
have a parent, therapist, guide, adult friend, or other safe adult who does not work for the school (or court, or whatever), someone who has no reason to pressure the child to give any specific answers, sit with the child ahead of time.
i’ve had the same one for years, because i really cannot manage more than one project of accordion-file magnitude at a time (“knowing your limits” being another important aspect of executive functioning).
mentors can also help link a kid up with long-term experiences where they can get their hands dirty and become part of the action, particularly as they move into the teen years.
for whichever version, teach kids to write down all of the pulls on their time.
so the activities aren’t just for fun and games — we’re creating the opportunity for a developmental need to be met.
there are a lot of books written about gifted kids and how to parent them.
but it’sparticularly important for gt and 2e kids, because they all too often don’t get enough of the self-efficacy and empathic mirroring / accreditation experiences that most kids get in school.
judges are not pressured to make anyone “not feel bad.”)
this costsnothing to implement, and not only does the book tell a principal how and why, it even includes sample letters to help manage the political stuff around it.
it likes to collect lots of interesting little things (binder clips, staplers, etc), but we’re back to william of ockham there – if you don’t need it, get rid of it.
the openness of the structure allows for more of that to happen.
similarly, we have a family set of task lists — since we’re an iphone / ipod touch family, we use an app called geetasks that interfaces withgoogle tasks.
to avoid the problem, i make it my personal goal to get rid of those pieces of paper as soon as possible by entering the relevant information into my system.
ideally, no paper should ever be loose, but i live on planet earth, so i do understand.
4-h is a very flexible program, which can definitely be bewildering at times, but the flexibility is great for gifted and 2e kids.
and, admittedly sometimes the systems are for the convenience of the teachers — e.g., they want to be able to collect notebooks and take them home to check that kids are doing their work.
all pieces of paper get saved until the end of the year (actually, for a few years, if you think you might have any interaction with the special education system).
as with the  paper-management system, i advise keeping things as simple as possible.
i will say, however, that many disorganized kids (including everyone in my household old enough to need an organizer) do manage to hold onto electronic devices, despite everyone’s fears, so don’t assume that the kid who loses everything will also lose their electronic portable brain.)
if you do your work basically at your desk, then try a whole bunch of horizontal letter trays, or a mail sorter (obviously, both of those items can be found in stylish versions, too, but i’m showing cheap-and-ugly options).
someone who is at least moderately bright and who is a good listener is okay for a client who is
hoagies also has a wealth of articles with every possible opinion on every possible topic, but chances are good that’s what got you overwhelmed in the first place (grin).
this is a perfect example of what i call “silent differentiation,” which will be the topic of another post. (note that for some kids with asperger’s or adhd, programs which have more structure are sometimes a better fit.
unless a teacher specifically requires that a textbook come to class, textbooks should live at home all the time.
some readers might be new to the whole giftedness thing, and might be overwhelmed.
a recent publication from my esteemed mentor, jean peterson, showed that most accredited counselor training programs offerzero training in understanding giftedness, and those that do have only very tiny amounts of time spent on the topic.
there aren’t any studies yet looking at training programs for psychologists, but my sense of it is that, if anything, the situation is worse, since “gifted education” exists as a distinct field, while “gifted psychology” kinda basically doesn’t.
we work our whole lives to become, if we’re lucky, managers of sorts.
too much empty air and paper being carried around.
planning work time also requires kids to predict how long they think a task or subtask will take… and thus provides a good opportunity for them to also track how long somethingactually took, so that they can become more accurate predictors in the future.
if a kid feels weird or intimidated about asking for a mentor, remind them that most people who are truly passionate about their careers alsolove to share that passion with others, especially young folks who might want to grow up to be like them.
you’d like a reminder to come such that you will actually do the thing before forgetting about it (we call these “point-of-performance” reminders).
most pre-bound systems that schools hand out and that are  easily available in stores don’t handle this elegantly, and you’re stuck copying some pages as you make the transition from one year to another.
the article is mainly about the fact that the public perception of science as a profession is shaped largely by mad-scientist movies and whiz-bang demonstrations.
but if you feel that a kid shouldn’t be present in their own iep meetings by the mid to late teenage years, chances are good that you also need to be thinking about legal guardianship or conservatorship in adulthood.
hoagies again is a great one to follow, and allow yourself to bop around and enjoy the variety of viewpoints.
a few good grades were being taken out of context to indicate that he was doing extremely well, and the team was on the verge of exiting him from the special education system, until he pointed out that there were good reasons why he had done well on those assignments that had nothing to do with his disabilities having magically been cured.
if you have a system like this, consider also implementing a regular adult task that involves sitting down with the kid and extracting the relevant information from the kid’s planner.
but usually, the main purpose of pocket folders is to become overstuffed and to have papers fall out of them into a random and comical heap at inopportune moments.
frequently, you can get rid of a lot of the intermediate materials, and then you need some sort of long-term storage for the stuff you want to keep.
a few good grades were being taken out of context to indicate that he was doing extremely well, and the team was on the verge of exiting him from the special education system, until he pointed out that there were good reasons why he had done well on those assignments that had nothing to do with his disabilities having magically been cured.
if you have two different things, then you’re going to (a) put information in the wrong place or in only one of the places (b) look in the wrong place or in only one of the places and thus miss something you need to know.
because although i knew intellectually that science was a lot of hard work and a very long process, some little part of me still held onto the magical belief that you had a brilliant idea on monday, did the experiment on tuesday, got data (cells gotta grow overnight) on wednesday, published on thursday, and on friday were on the plane to stockholm.
we know that gifted folk are found in every social, ethnic, racial, and economic group, but, well, like i said, a lot of folks don’t know what they don’t know.
(note that both paper and electronic systems are likely to be royally messed up by laundering, and both can often be restored by various heroic means.
when there are (inevitable) changes in task or time information, they can be changed easily without leaving lots of scribbly mess.
for us oldsters, or for older kids who are homeschooling or who do a lot ofout-of-school activities, the smallest item you can get the information into reliably and neatly and can keep on your person, without forgetting it’s there and laundering it (sigh) is probably best, because it facilitates efficient idea capture.
first, by high school age, even kids who are below average in intelligence tend to be aware that people are making decisions about them without their participation.
you might be surprised how much depth of thought you will hear.
second, one of my predoctoral internships was atthe arlington school.
at home, you need a good-sized d-ring binder, like this, with ordinary paper dividers to mirror the dividers in the traveling binder.
gifted kids need career guidance.
birdie likes school and i think she’s getting a good education.
size: you could, i suppose, use 8.5″ x 11″ sheets, whether purchased or homebrewed, and integrate this right into the front of the traveling zip-binder i describe inthis post.
sure, you’ll probably end up with way too many ideas, and you’ll hear all sorts of, er, very strong opinions.
note that this is all before we add any textbooks to those backpacks, if you were concerned about weight.
i also like suggestions on how i can more effectively use this or other online forums — despite having been on the net for over 25 years (!), i tend not to be a particularly rapid adopter of the new and shiny.
plus, you need one ordinary divider for each kind of extra paper (lined, graph, plain) that will be required — put maybe 10-30 pages of blank paper in each.
judges in all events are explicitly told to give clear and understandable feedback on which aspects of the entry were done well and how the entry could be improved, and to measure kids against developmentally-appropriate but meaningfully high standards.
if you can get yourself to commit to a consistent location (say, a desk or other workspace, which i’ll have hints for in another post), then the discipline becomes that the pcds always get returned to that location, not just dropped wherever they happen to be when your brain moves on to another task.
it’s not designed as a place you drop your kids off and go do the shopping.
carolyn k curates probably the largest single pile of links to all things gifted.
i frankly don’t think that parents (who are probably pretty smart themselves!) need to read every book out there — there’s not going to be that much new information once you’ve read one.
the problem i have with this system is that it’s usually hard for kids to write in these, just because they’re not in the kitchen when most of the information they need to write down is given to them.
okay, to be fair, i’m willing to guess that a couple of those binders might be destined to live in classrooms instead of traveling back and forth to lockers and home.
normally, this district actually does a pretty good job with most things, and even a very good job with some things.
too much labor involved in routine use.
if they’ve got unmetabolized “stuff,” it’s going to play out in the relationship.
no graph paper for either math or science.
my aforementioned dissertation literature review took up a full-sized hanging-file box (actually overflowed it by the end).
if they’ve got unmetabolized “stuff,” it’s going to play out in the relationship.
colored and sort-of-erasable mechanical pencils do exist, although the leads are generally quite fragile — if you are gentle, use those, otherwise, a few colors of ball-point are fine.
there’s even a companion cd-rom with customizable forms for the teachers to use.
in cluster grouping, instead of spreading the gifted kids out among all classes in a grade (which seems “fair” to the teachers, but makes it very hard for the gifted kids to find each other), they get put in groups of about 5-6 kids within a few classrooms.
i also like suggestions on how i can more effectively use this or other online forums — despite having been on the net for over 25 years (!), i tend not to be a particularly rapid adopter of the new and shiny.
if you really only have a few things you need to deal with at any given time, and, again, you’re good about offloading things into long-term storage, think about something like acontractor’s clipboard.
remember that i’m here giving you permission to relax, take a breath, work with the school, don’t give up, accept that you don’t have to find a perfect solution right away, and that there’s no one right way to do anything.
1 glue stick (ah, now i’m wondering if this is the crucial piece to their cunning plan — those oversized spiral-bounds could easily be chosen so that every we’re-going-green-single-side-printed handout can be meticulously glued in place!
second, it corrals any pieces of paper which have not yet made it into the rings.
i have particular expertise in cognitive, academic, and psychological assessment, the psychological and social effects of high intelligence, theories of intelligence and personality, and the real world of various educational strategies.
the danger point here is that you aren’t going to be reminded of the task until the last minute.
i also don’t like ones that have a rigid gusset — they’re just asking to get crushed, and they take up too much space when they’re not full.
if they don’t want help, we can’t force them to accept it.
i’ve heard consistent reports from gt clients that if they weren’t able to leave therapy (many child or adolescent clients don’t feel they have much choice in the matter), they were highly successful not just in stonewalling, but in outright snowing therapists who they felt didn’t empathize with them effectively (my favorite was the tweenaged client who structured her play so as to make her therapist come to certain interpretations).
unless a teacher specifically requires that a textbook come to class, textbooks should live at home all the time.
okay, i promised some ideas on planners and how to keep track of assignments.
second, it corrals any pieces of paper which have not yet made it into the rings.
they don’t include the information for anything not related to school.
along with that, by the way, if you think your child might be twice-exceptional, or if you live in a state where gifted education is handled through the special education process, the place to go iswrightslaw.
i don’t believe in using lockers for anything (other than maybe your coat), because (1) most schools don’t provide enough time to go to them (2) they add a layer of complication, a location where things can get left by accident.
also, i would want someone who in your initial interview seems to have some level of personal empathy with those experiences — they don’t necessarily have to have had them themselves, but it helps if they’re close enough that they didn’t
and don’t worry about that “social-emotional” thing, or the one story they can tell you about the kid who accelerated and was miserable — the most important social-emotional need for gifted kids is appropriate academic challenge and real peers.
if a kid feels weird or intimidated about asking for a mentor, remind them that most people who are truly passionate about their careers alsolove to share that passion with others, especially young folks who might want to grow up to be like them.
knowing about your own personal learning and working profile, in its many dimensions (subject for a future post), is important.
the goal is to help us figure out whowe are and how to act like ourselves, just in an adaptive way.
you need to set up some kind of regular routine that will remind you toempty that capture-box into the actual planner.
remember that being able to write small also contributes to keeping the whole object small, too (see below).
some ideas on this front: email can make a good capture site and a good way for members of a family to send each other information, butonly if you then also take the oath that you willimmediately transcribe any information found in your inbox into the proper place later, or create a folder (better: one with an automatic sort-int0-this-folder rule!)
or perhaps because backpacks usually have appropriately-sized pockets, so pencil pouches are superfluous.)
you probably don’t need wheels because you’re not going to carry all that much most of the time.
to learn about what the research actually says about the various different forms of academic acceleration, you can download thea nation deceived report for free.
for another instance, when i was working on the literature review for my dissertation, there were piles and piles of papers on various topics.
that’s really upsetting, too.
at home, you also need an ordinary stapler and a heavy-duty 3-hole punch (cheaper than you might think, and a worthwhile investment).
similarly, we have a family set of task lists — since we’re an iphone / ipod touch family, we use an app called geetasks that interfaces withgoogle tasks.
(side note: those who are fans of ross greene and stuart ablon’s work around teaching kids to self-regulate will recognize this process, and those who are not familiar with it should readtheir book (professionals should read this one) or check out the website.
she talks about how to actually implement techniques like curriculum compacting (test out of what you already know), differentiated lesson plans (have different kids do different things on the same topic), and independent projects, without spending lots of money or putting forth enormous effort.
same thing with what you will do when a project is completed.
speaking of the culture of the group, this is one that tends to attract a crowd marked bycuriosity and passion, highly enriched for bright-to-gifted folks.
although some bumbling is inevitable in any volunteer effort, this doesn’t have to create a blind-leading-the-blind race to the bottom.
if what you find doesn’t come with a zip or other means to close it and protect the pages, try adding an elastic strap or rubber band.
the kid gets experience that both helps them understand the complexity of a field and, oh, by the way, looks great on applications.
so it matters who else shows up, but there’s a way for you to realize that someone else’s work having been better doesn’t mean that what you did stinks.
this is a great thing for them to learn to do, and a nice well-constructed venue for them to learn to do it in.
to learn about what the research actually says about the various different forms of academic acceleration, you can download thea nation deceived report for free.
or they could call me for a short-term professional consultation — i’m thrilled to be able to spread the knowledge here.
explain the purpose of the meeting, explain the questions that the adults will be thinking through, and take the time to make sure the child understands as well as they are developmentally able to.
people who don’t know much about brains like to call this a right-brained processing style, or a visual processing style (sorry, both of those concepts would get me laughed out of the cool neuropsych parties — the current research on the topic is much more complex than any such simple-minded dichotomy would support).
perhaps obvious in retrospect, but not obvious to a caring and empathic tween girl who loves animals and science.
if you have an electronic system, think about how you are going to use reminders intelligently.
think about it… when they’re 18 years old, legally, they chair the iep meetings.
although the program in ma goes way beyond its agricultural roots, it is still fundamentally a program to train young people to run small businesses.
if you go to hoagies (of course), there is a list of mailing lists and ways to get in contact with other parents: http://www.hoagiesgifted.org/on-line_support.htm.
the kid finds out that it’s not what they thought it was and they’d rather go in a different direction in the same field or pursue other passions entirely.
in another post, i’ll talk about the system i usually start with — it works pretty well for most kids who struggle with organization.
for whichever version, teach kids to write down all of the pulls on their time.
i would say that in general, kids’ input shouldalways be sought in the iep process, as well as in any legal or other processes where grownups are talking with each other and making high-stakes decisions about them.
i hate to have to say it, but i really do think that therapists who work with smart folks probably should be at least reasonably smart themselves, if for no other reason than so they can follow the logic and metaphor, quick thinking, intuitive leaps, and so on.
another potential pitfall: if your system has portable elements, they can get lost and then you have to waste time tearing up the house and screaming about the missing pcd.
you’ll take ten minutes, tops, to go through the binder and the backpack and find all of the papers in those folders plus any stray calves.
my dissertation research, on the therapeutic working alliance between gifted clients and their therapists, was useful in that it showed where some of the major pitfalls were.
when i’ve had those lovely conversations with quite young kids, their parents are typicallynot hovering around.
that makes it possible for adults to model their own process as lifelong learners.
the kid gets experience that both helps them understand the complexity of a field and, oh, by the way, looks great on applications.
at home, you also need an ordinary stapler and a heavy-duty 3-hole punch (cheaper than you might think, and a worthwhile investment).
however, if that’s a problem area, then it needs to get explicitly cued and practiced specifically until it becomes part of the pcd-use routine.
yes, that’s the potential downfall of living life in the pile zone.
knowing a lot of facts about science or having precocious math procedural skills (which is what precocious science-y math-y kids often manifest with) is a great potentiator of creative thought later in life, but it isn’t the same thing.
basically, giftedness is not considered a relevant dimension of human difference or cultural experience.
the kids there are all there, atenormous school district expense, because they have debilitating major mental illnesses and really honestly cannot emotionally handle being in a regular high school.
but of course, you linear folks are probably silently freaking out that i’m about to tell your kid that it’s okay to have piles of stuff all over the desk, the floor, the backpack, piling on top of each other, falling over, getting mixed up together, being indistinguishable from each other, oh, man, what a mess.
the printed-out material i’m organizing into the outline for my book (on, perhaps not surprisingly, helping bright-to-gifted folks with executive functioning) is in it right now — each section is a chapter.
good carry-around pockets are good for about an inch or two of paper, which handles quite a wide variety of projects.
you can mimic one, sans the huge amounts ofchartjunk usually found in kid-oriented ones, and with enough lines for the different “subjects” in kids’ real lives, if you buy ateachers’ planner, except that teachers are often assumed not to need to plan anything on the weekends.
so what we need is a way to interview prospective providers to find out what theyactually know, rather than what they’ll tell you they know.
it took literally ten years (four as an undergrad, during which i was involved in bench research almost all the way through, and six as a grad student), before i understood what this article is talking about, and realized that my extraverted novelty-loving big-picture-oriented but not-much-of-a-schmoozing personality was not a good fit for the real life of a scientist.
you call their number from the phone (they have an iphone app, too, of course), say your voice memo, and it gets transcribed and sent to you in an email.
personally, since i type rapidly, i often take the time to simply retype those sheets into my computer (or get an electronic copy from the teacher or the website), which eliminates concerns about losing them.
i do get some emergency-type calls (school is in the process of throwing a kid out, kid is emotionally falling apart on a regular basis, etc.), and if that’s the kind of situation you’re in, absolutelysend me a note or give me a call and i’ll talk you through.
somehow, even though open file boxes aren’t all that different from hanging files in a file drawer, the kind normal human beings seem to be able to manage, i don’t lose track of stuff as easily when it’s in open filing like that.
i would say that in general, kids’ input shouldalways be sought in the iep process, as well as in any legal or other processes where grownups are talking with each other and making high-stakes decisions about them.
there are a lot of books written about gifted kids and how to parent them.
if a kid has iq and achievement scores both above 145, there are some great opportunities available through thedavidson institute for talent development.
if they don’t want help, we can’t force them to accept it.
younger kids, who usually only have one teacher for most subjects which assign homework, can have a single hot-folder in the front of the binder.
for instance, when i am doing a report on an assessment, i want to be able to grab one or more test protocols, the history, notes i took during the assessment, scoring worksheets and graphs i cooked up, spread them out, leaf through them, and then shove them away easily.
perhaps because no one other than the health teacher thinks they need writing implements.
if you’re looking for some specific suggestions for curricula, toys, books, contests, local groups, you name it, go tohoagies.
have a parent, therapist, guide, adult friend, or other safe adult who does not work for the school (or court, or whatever), someone who has no reason to pressure the child to give any specific answers, sit with the child ahead of time.
i frankly don’t think that parents (who are probably pretty smart themselves!)
no recriminations, just find the stragglers and round ‘em up, get ‘em in the rings.
but of course, you linear folks are probably silently freaking out that i’m about to tell your kid that it’s okay to have piles of stuff all over the desk, the floor, the backpack, piling on top of each other, falling over, getting mixed up together, being indistinguishable from each other, oh, man, what a mess.
categories: getting started tags: introduction well, now that i’ve finally graduated and don’t have papers and a dissertation to write, i’m ready to start actually writing more for the general public.
since our gt and 2e kids are so often not well-matched to the in-school activities, and because there are so many choices for out-of-school stuff, many of which simply replicate the problems with the typical in-school activities, it becomes crucial for us to think about how we can recognize the subtexts in an activity that will support the kids’ growth.
although the program in ma goes way beyond its agricultural roots, it is still fundamentally a program to train young people to run small businesses.
colored and sort-of-erasable mechanical pencils do exist, although the leads are generally quite fragile — if you are gentle, use those, otherwise, a few colors of ball-point are fine.
we work together to develop and troubleshoot systems for corraling all those loose papers, books, notebooks, projects, etc.
it’s a plan for oh-so-many last-minute crises when the eldritch horrors that live in kids’ lockers have mysteriously hidden the items they needed to do their homework so that the kid wasn’t able to rescue them before dashing out to the bus.
you might be a bit hypersensitive, sure (i see that a lot, especially from adult gt folks who had educationally or socially traumatic experiences in childhood), but in the shrink biz, they teach us to pay attention to those feelings.
(note that for some kids with asperger’s or adhd, programs which have more structure are sometimes a better fit.
the culture of the group honestly celebrates hard work and achievement, regardless of the personal characteristics of the achiever.
fortunately, this isn’t a school that has gotten all security-crazed to the point where they don’t allow backpacks or tote bags.
of course, sometimes that planning is itself a nontrivial task — in fact, it’s the first task in the assignment, and should probably be done as soon as possible.
that’s a rough sort that will get you through the week.
the gt universe is also moving into social media — many of the major players have facebook pages (you can find minehere), blogs, twitter accounts, etc.
but they won’t learn how to do it without guided practice.
if i had a buck every time one of my slippery-fish kiddos with adhd said, “oh, i didn’t think we really had to do that assignment, because she didn’t put it up on the website,” or, “i can’t do it because i didn’t write down what the teacher said because i thought they were supposed to put it up on the website so now i don’t quite know what it is i have to do,” i’d be rich.
in general, gifted folk don’t do as well in rigidly manualized treatments (which are, sadly, becoming extremely popular).
you probably don’t need wheels because you’re not going to carry all that much most of the time.
when i’m working with someone, we do them together at the start of every session, and we rely on a cue card or checklist that lives in the binder, too.
(i have personally see this play out, at times tragically, in a few situations, where a newly-minted legal adult made decisions that were mostly informed by their lack of experience.)
in fact, i think this is the single most tricky and dangerous aspect of system design, and one on which i have the fewest specific suggestions.
the lists are *very* helpful for parents to get advice and feedback from each other, and even just to have a place to talk about what they’re going through without being assumed to be bragging.
you need to set up some kind of regular routine that will remind you toempty that capture-box into the actual planner.
partly because both technology and paper products change so quickly, it’s easy to get mired into trying to design a single best system, or to invest a lot of money and effort setting up something that seems cool only to have it collapse under its own weight.
similarly, in those news stories, the contribution of the lone genius scientist is overplayed, forgetting about the legions of graduate students and postdocs who actuallydo the work, as well as the centuries of giants upon whose shoulders they all stand.
when i’m handling one good-sized project with a bunch of different facets to it (e.g., job search), i have a 13-pocket accordion folder, made of durable plastic, likethis one.
i recommend the thinnest lead you won’t keep breaking, the cheapest bulk version of that pencil you can find (.7mm, .5mm).
as with the paper-management system, i advise keeping things as simple as possible.
look for one that has a cover (like the one i linked) to protect the pad from getting trashed.
whatever you choose, losing it will be a time-wasting and anxiety-provoking crisis.
don’t back off all at once, or they will have no idea where to go or what theycould or should expect from themselves.
the low-tech version, of course, is the official family calendar, located at some central place in the household (usually the kitchen).
my dissertation research, on the therapeutic working alliance between gifted clients and their therapists, was useful in that it showed where some of the major pitfalls were.
teachers are, um, not always entirely reliable about writing in them.
you also can’t teach organizational skills by imposing a system that is complex and onerous enough that kids need you to direct them every inch of the way.
either way, they started web-searching, and quickly found themselves confused and overwhelmed — there is so much information, so much jargon, all the information is contradictory, and so much of it is, well, highly opinionated.
electronic systems can be set to harass remind you of upcoming tasks or deadlines.
she talks about how to actually implement techniques like curriculum compacting (test out of what you already know), differentiated lesson plans (have different kids do different things on the same topic), and independent projects, without spending lots of money or putting forth enormous effort.
personally, if you can afford to implement it, i favor the electronic solutions, because they offer some advantages that are hard to duplicate in paper form.
but it didn’t help with the basic problem that most therapists think theydo get it (an example of the dunning-kruger effect, where the lack of knowledge and metacognitive skills in a domain interferes with accurate self-assessment of skill in a domain — basically, if you don’t know what you don’t know, you don’t know that you don’t know it).
if you’re not there yet, that’s fine, no one will sneer at you, but they also won’t tell you it’s good when it’s not.
but it’s probably just as well to put that stuff in the pocket designed for it in the backpack.
and some other kids will have parental or professional support called into play so as to prevent the worst of the failure.
however, i usually actually prefer the planner to be a separate item that is small enough and portable enough to be with you on a constant or near-constant basis.
plus, you need one ordinary divider for each kind of extra paper (lined, graph, plain) that will be required — put maybe 10-30 pages of blank paper in each.
there’s a lot that i see being done well here.
explain the purpose of the meeting, explain the questions that the adults will be thinking through, and take the time to make sure the child understands as well as they are developmentally able to.
if you use it, make sure that it’s not in a location that makes it hard to lay paper flat and write on it.
obviously, some things might have to get moved or deleted if there is too much homework.
it took literally ten years (four as an undergrad, during which i was involved in bench research almost all the way through, and six as a grad student), before i understood what this article is talking about, and realized that my extraverted novelty-loving big-picture-oriented but not-much-of-a-schmoozing personality was not a good fit for the real life of a scientist.
teach kids the habit of rechecking the assignment sheet as they go, rather than trying to remember what the teacher expected and when any intermediate due dates might have been.
the gt universe is also moving into social media — many of the major players have facebook pages (you can find minehere), blogs, twitter accounts, etc.
it can handle some level of hierarchy, although for most complex tasks, i think it’s okay to maintain the separate assignment sheet the teacher handed out, or the separate outline you created for yourself in something like omnioutliner or freemind (more on that below).
usually schools have good intentions in doing these — they’re honestly trying to teach kids organizational skills.
if you change your pile labels frequently, try taping a pad of small post-it notes to your letter trays so you can write and rewrite.
but if you’re not entering it immediately, it needs to actually physically be put in the capture inbox, and it must get emptied into the real system with everything else.
each of us creates the tasks we need, but anyone can edit any list.
for each subject, one side of the divider holds papers the teacher has handed out which haven’t gotten into the rings yet, and the other side holds homework (and permission slips, etc) which is completed and not yet handed in.
that is, you need to get rid of obsolete stuff so it doesn’t make the current stuff harder to find in the pile — if the pile has more than about a dozen items, two dozen at the outside, you’re going to waste too much time searching it.
you can mimic one, sans the huge amounts ofchartjunk usually found in kid-oriented ones, and with enough lines for the different “subjects” in kids’ real lives, if you buy ateachers’ planner, except that teachers are often assumed not to need to plan anything on the weekends.
some readers might be new to the whole giftedness thing, and might be overwhelmed.
they don’t have to show any particular talent for anything; in general, any time someone says, “i’m interested in maybe doing x,” the response will be, “that’s cool!
electronic systems can back up to a main computer or store the information in the “cloud.”
and few decisions are truly permanent — you can usually change course later.
kids need to know the rule:  it is your job to get the assignment written down, even if your teacher screws up and doesn’t write it on the website.
if you like that size/form factor, try using alarge desktop monthly-organizer pad pinned to a corkboard.
for instance, when i am doing a report on an assessment, i want to be able to grab one or more test protocols, the history, notes i took during the assessment, scoring worksheets and graphs i cooked up, spread them out, leaf through them, and then shove them away easily.
they should also volunteer information that fell into a kid’s blind spots, stuff they didn’t even think to ask about.
in another post, i’ll talk about the system i usually start with — it works pretty well for most kids who struggle with organization.
the zip-binder usually has a zip pocket that can hold pencils and pens and anything else needed.
of course, by sheer random chance, some kids in this school will manage this system
so i don’t think i’d be too quick to assume that a kid can’t learn to tolerate the experience.
hoagies again is a great one to follow, and allow yourself to bop around and enjoy the variety of viewpoints.
in cluster grouping, instead of spreading the gifted kids out among all classes in a grade (which seems “fair” to the teachers, but makes it very hard for the gifted kids to find each other), they get put in groups of about 5-6 kids within a few classrooms.
no.  i don’t have enough working memory for that.
that’s good, because in real life, we are all captains of our own teams.
properly handled, having kids participate in their own meetings can contribute to their own maturational process.
first, it protects the binder and the papers in it from getting destroyed when something else is shoved into the backpack.
obviously, some things might have to get moved or deleted if there is too much homework.
if you were going to say that a kid couldn’t handle being in their own iep meeting, those kids would be high on the list of kids you’d assume couldn’t cope.
last thing (at least until i think of another one): you need to have a system for offloading the content of the pcd as the project shifts focus.
(yes, the recordkeeping requirements can be difficult for dysgraphic kids… but at least in my state, they’re voluntary, there’s a long time to get things done, and because of that “silent differentiation” effect, they can actually serve as a forum for the kids to build skills over time.)
either way, they started web-searching, and quickly found themselves confused and overwhelmed — there is so much information, so much jargon, all the information is contradictory, and so much of it is, well, highly opinionated.
as i wrote each section, the folder with that pile of papers got sent to the back of the box, providing an encouraging visual of my progress.
fortunately, this isn’t a school that has gotten all security-crazed to the point where they don’t allow backpacks or tote bags.
if you don’t change them frequently, stickers or labels will work.
note, however, that the therapist who happens to be gifted needs to have done their own work and come to some level of acceptance and understanding of their own intelligence.
2 double-pocket folders (note that these are designated for a specific subject, so they’renot likely to be intended as general “hot folders” (for carrying homework and parent handouts back and forth), which might actually be a use, at least for one of them.
as i wrote each section, the folder with that pile of papers got sent to the back of the box, providing an encouraging visual of my progress.
perhaps obvious in retrospect, but not obvious to a caring and empathic tween girl who loves animals and science.
it’s highly competitive.
some classes may require more than one section (english class is famous for this, with “language arts” and “literature” often being separate areas) — for the secondary divisions,ordinary dividers are fine.
partly because both technology and paper products change so quickly, it’s easy to get mired into trying to design a single best system, or to invest a lot of money and effort setting up something that seems cool only to have it collapse under its own weight.
the courses are generally terrific, and the chance to be with other gifted kids is one that many kids treasure.
kids need real information about what those people really do all day, what the life is like, what personality characteristics and working styles are good fits for it (and which are not!).
(supporting the emotional needs of the gifted) website, too.
eventually, kids can do it on their own, but we wait at each step to see that it’s happening reliably before we fade the support.
the blue-ribbon items then compete against each other for first, second, and third place.
so they need to capture those ideas — essentially, creating an assignment for themselves to write the information into the family calendar.
another reason why it helps to have someone reasonably smart so that the kid will have a harder time snowing them if they try.
i don’t believe in using lockers for anything (other than maybe your coat), because (1) most schools don’t provide enough time to go to them (2) they add a layer of complication, a location where things can get left by accident.
absent certain really seriously exacerbating circumstances, adults have the right to make their own decisions, no matter how foolish.
if you were going to say that a kid couldn’t handle being in their own iep meeting, those kids would be high on the list of kids you’d assume couldn’t cope.
i mentioned above that people love to teach what they know .
you can design and print your own pages pretty easily in any word-processing software, if you prefer.
if you need more help, ask me, ask on the mailing lists, ask on the bboards, ask wherever, and you’ll get lots of help.
they typically getzero training in gifted issues while in teacher school, and what they do get typically just perpetuates the myths.
you can do this, and it’s quite an adequate system,if you are really good about keeping dates on pages, and if you are really good about emptying the thing on a very regular basis into the home-based permanent-storage binder, and if you don’t mind that this routine is going to take a little longer because you have to impose order at that point.
if nothing else, having a qualifying score on these is a cheap-and-easy way to get something objective in hand that you can share with your child’s district when they say, “oh, we have lots of kids just like that.”
if you would like to use a paper system, i’d recommend something like a dayrunner or franklin planner, which allows you to customize sheet types and to keep adding new sheets and retiring old sheets as you go.
basically, giftedness is not considered a relevant dimension of human difference or cultural experience.
not such a bad worst case — better than finding it out six years into graduate school.
in fact, i think this is the single most tricky and dangerous aspect of system design, and one on which i have the fewest specific suggestions.
there are some kinds of situations where i keep track of stuff linearly, sure, but most of the time, nope.
experience their own intelligence as always a positive thing.
very useful for groceries and errands, too!
no graph paper for either math or science.
courses can be expensive but financial aid is available.
1 three-ring binder, 2″ thick, with lined paper and reinforcements (i do appreciate the foresight of the tech-ed teacher.
for a project, often you’re handling many different pieces or chunks of paper, but the order of them not only doesn’t count, it is often really helpful to be able to move them around, spread them out on the table, mix and match, look at various things at the same time, and so on.
if they insist, i adviseplain old medium-point black stick pens, nothing fancy.
i recommend the thinnest lead you won’t keep breaking, the cheapest bulk version of that pencil you can find (.7mm, .5mm).
when i’m working with someone, we do them together at the start of every session, and we rely on a cue card or checklist that lives in the binder, too.
if you change your pile labels frequently, try taping a pad of small post-it notes to your letter trays so you can write and rewrite.
i actually don’t think that anyone needs pens for school.

if they really prefer, they can have a separate hot-folder, but it must not be one of those cheap paper 2-pocket folders — those are not durable enough.
if what you find doesn’t come with a zip or other means to close it and protect the pages, try adding an elastic strap or rubber band.
not such a bad worst case — better than finding it out six years into graduate school.
another thing i think 4-h does really well is, tied in with the high-standards thing, encouraging kids tobuild transferable life skills .
a recent publication from my esteemed mentor, jean peterson, showed that most accredited counselor training programs offerzero training in understanding giftedness, and those that do have only very tiny amounts of time spent on the topic.
in any domain, there are likely to be quite a lot of skills which can be meaningfully taught at an appropriate level by someone who is further along the path, such thatboth teacher and learner are able to meaningfully increase their understanding and skill, and to derive self-efficacy from doing so.
i don’t like flimsy clear-poly pockets — they feel like they’re not going to hold up, and they aren’t stiff enough to protect the papers well.
same with having occasional visits in the classroom or one-time shadowing experiences — again, the focus tends to be on the gee-whiz aspects of the career, a sales job more than anything else.
trying something out, over a long enough time to get past the “squeeeee!” stage, is terrific.
see, you can’t teach kids organizational skills just by putting them in a situation where organizational skills would be a really good idea.
for those who have read the twisted tale of my life thus far and how i got from being the youngest in my class to being the oldest in my class, finally finishing school (this time for sure!) at the tender age of 42, you’ll know that i started life as a starry-eyed molecular biologist.
those go at the start of the section for the relevant class and stay there as long as they are needed.
club leaders are told to encourage parents (even dads!)
so when i look at her supply list, i’m, well, a trifle concerned.
extensive assignment sheets (for major projects) usually belong in page protectors (each page in its own, please, so that you can read them easily, don’t stuff a multi-page stapled thing into something that will require you to take it out to read the inside pages!), placed in the rings at the beginning of the relevant section of thebinder.
if they really prefer, they can have a separate hot-folder, but it must not be one of those cheap paper 2-pocket folders — those are not durable enough.
along with that, by the way, if you think your child might be twice-exceptional, or if you live in a state where gifted education is handled through the special education process, the place to go iswrightslaw.
so i don’t think i’d be too quick to assume that a kid can’t learn to tolerate the experience.
it’s not the easiest site to browse through, just because there’s so much of it — use the search tool liberally.
those go at the start of the section for the relevant class and stay there as long as they are needed.
hoagies also has a wealth of articles with every possible opinion on every possible topic, but chances are good that’s what got you overwhelmed in the first place (grin).
so part of the goal of the whole process is to train them to be good at the role of team member, and eventually to take on the role of teamcaptain .
well, now that i’ve finally graduated and don’t have papers and a dissertation to write, i’m ready to start actually writing more for the general public.
it’s awhole-family intergenerational activity.
an article making the rounds, which is funny because it’s so true.
most kids are not appointment-driven; rather, they are project-driven (for adults, it depends a lot on the type of job you have).
the key is to get something that you can get all of your information into (so that you can trust that everything you need to know is in there), and get all of your information out of… reliably and simply.
what i think is most helpful is for those kids to have ongoing mentor relationships with adults in the field, folks who will honestly answer questions and suggest routes by which kids can meaningfully explore and pursue their passions.
if you use it, make sure that it’s not in a location that makes it hard to lay paper flat and write on it.
first, by high school age, even kids who are below average in intelligence tend to be aware that people are making decisions about them without their participation.
if everything is blue-ribbon quality, everything can get a blue ribbon.
if you overflow during the course of the school year, you can always split into two big binders.
when something outgrows an accordion folder, it’s not really going to be particularly portable anyhow.
getting professional help (from a formal assessment, a therapy relationship, a career counselor familiar with gifted kids (i.e., who won’t just say, “ooh, you’re so wonderful, you can be anything you want to be!”) can provide another helpful outside perspective.
also, have available at home a small box of page protectors, preferably matte-finish ones.
alarms may be useful, but not if you’re just going to snooze them or ignore them — think about what moment you’d like a reminder to come such that you will actually do the thing before forgetting about it (we call these “point-of-performance” reminders).
for example, my little bird, who wants to be a veterinarian, found out from her mentor that a huge part of the job is about dealing withhumans, keeping the patients’ owners happy, because no cat ever brings themselves to the vet.
even hanging folders can work as pcds, when they’re not getting hidden in a file drawer and disappearing from memory.
i don’t have enough working memory for that.
the goal is to have one object that handles all of the task-related information and time-related information in as simple a fashion as possible.
i will say, however, that many disorganized kids (including everyone in my household old enough to need an organizer) do manage to hold onto electronic devices, despite everyone’s fears, so don’t assume that the kid who loses everything will also lose their electronic portable brain.)
chime in below!categories: social-emotional tags: career, guidance, mentoring, multipotentiality one of the things that i do a lot of with kids, especially kids in middle school or high school, is help them deal with the paper chase.
there are some kinds of situations where i keep track of stuff linearly, sure, but most of the time, nope.
however, particularly as we make it into adulthood — and i’m willing to bet that there are some homeschoolers or afterschoolers who would also be in this boat — things are often organized less around routine stuff happening every day or week, and more around discreteprojects.
this costsnothing to implement, and not only does the book tell a principal how and why, it even includes sample letters to help manage the political stuff around it.
giftedness is treated with a lot of ambivalence in the usa and similar cultures — you’re supposed to have brilliant kids, but whatever you do, don’t talk about them.
for example, my little bird, who wants to be a veterinarian, found out from her mentor that a huge part of the job is about dealing withhumans, keeping the patients’ owners happy, because no cat ever brings themselves to the vet.
ideally, no paper should ever be loose, but i live on planet earth, so i do understand.
but if you don’t know what your own strengths and weaknesses are, you can neither think about how your current style might match up nor think intelligently about what you might want to develop about yourself in order to become a better match.
as the kids get older, the records start to look very much like resumes.
(little bird was helping run kids’ activities for a community group that needed supervision for their own kids while parents were in a seminar… when she was 8 years old.)
if you overflow during the course of the school year, you can always split into two big binders.
that is, you need to get rid of obsolete stuff so it doesn’t make the current stuff harder to find in the pile — if the pile has more than about a dozen items, two dozen at the outside, you’re going to waste too much time searching it.
some kids are just good at piling up facts.
yes, they do note that additional items may be added during the school year as needed.
if you’re using portable pockets, you might be able to get away with color-coding (i do — i usually have some mnemonic association between the color and the project, and that’s enough for me).
sure, you’ll probably end up with way too many ideas, and you’ll hear all sorts of, er, very strong opinions.
as i feared, little bird’s middle school has handed out their official agenda book that they plan to periodically check that the kids are using the way they have decided is the one right way.
so i tend to be in the mode of blaise pascal’s famous quote (often attributed to mark twain), “i wrote you a long letter, because i didn’t have time to write you a short letter.”
not every kid has easy access to a family friend who just happens to be in your field.)
(my family needs to know that on a certain day between certain times, i am seeing clients and am therefore unavailable.
better to let it be unfinished or imperfect and to create a learning opportunity for the kid.
(note that both paper and electronic systems are likely to be royally messed up by laundering, and both can often be restored by various heroic means.
(since i work primarily with gifted andmultiply-exceptional kids, they tend to be able to understand this information at very young ages, and they tend to be very upset when they are aware of people talking about them without seeking their input.)
even hanging folders can work as pcds, when they’re not getting hidden in a file drawer and disappearing from memory.
note, however, that the therapist who happens to be gifted needs to have done their own work and come to some level of acceptance and understanding of their own intelligence.
in order to prevent the crises when events collide, it really does help to have a system that everyone can use.
so teach them to write an assignment for, e.g.,  ”schedule time to work on book report,” the day the book report is assigned.
however, i usually actually prefer the planner to be a separate item that is small enough and portable enough to be with you on a constant or near-constant basis.
all pieces of paper get saved until the end of the year (actually, for a few years, if you think you might have any interaction with the special education system).
you also can’t teach organizational skills by imposing a system that is complex and onerous enough that kids need you to direct them every inch of the way.
they see us being wonderful at everything, and then try to hold themselves to those impossibly high standards.
for kids in school, that may not be a show-stopper; the times they get told things that need to get into the binder usuallyare the times when that zip-binder will be right with them.
if you have a system like this, consider also implementing a regular adult task that involves sitting down with the kid and extracting the relevant information from the kid’s planner.
tell them that it’s not an admission of fault or imperfection that they develop and use a system so that they don’t have to waste brain cycles remembering.)
sure, you could use a prettyportfolio, and that’s what i use now for walking-around notetaking-with-clients, but there’s some nice urban chic happening with the aluminum thing.
remember that i’m here giving you permission to relax, take a breath, work with the school, don’t give up, accept that you don’t have to find a perfect solution right away, and that there’s no one right way to do anything.
in our family, we manage time with google calendars — we have one for the kids (they might end up with one each when they get older), one for the parents’ public information, and one for each parent’s private information.
to-do lists are good for managing tasks, while calendars are good for managing time.
and you can use them for the active test-taking, too, and they don’t glow.
plus, most families have a raft of out-of-schooling activities and other pulls on their time.
that’s a rough sort that will get you through the week.
if you feel like you’re getting a dismissive or hostile reaction,go somewhere else and don’t feel bad about it.
gifted kids tend to have gifted parents, which can be really tough for them.
(i long ago gave up filing “that is neat and i might want it someday” stuff in my filing cabinets, because other than the few really important things, i would tend to forget not just what i named the file it got put in, but eventhat it ever existed at all.)
certainly, there is a very tiny minority of children who will not be able to handle it, even with guidance and training and practice.
another great organization is supporting the emotional needs of the gifted : besides having some very goodarticles on the social-emotional experience of giftedness, they train facilitators to run local parent support groups.
(side note: those who are fans of ross greene and stuart ablon’s work around teaching kids to self-regulate will recognize this process, and those who are not familiar with it should readtheir book (professionals should read this one) or check out the website.
but this list is not giving me all the warm fuzzy back-to-school feeling i’m hoping for.
if they need to have an educational advocate, therapist, adult friend, or other non-parental helpful person sitting next to them to help them understand what is going on and to help them figure out how to express their own ideas appropriately, then that’s a great service to provide for them.
for us oldsters, or for older kids who are homeschooling or who do a lot ofout-of-school activities, the smallest item you can get the information into reliably and neatly and can keep on your person, without forgetting it’s there and laundering it (sigh) is probably best, because it facilitates efficient idea capture.
it’s not the easiest site to browse through, just because there’s so much of it — use the search tool liberally.
if you don’t change them frequently, stickers or labels will work.
i’d have to add the constant stream of news stories in which some tiny incremental improvement in the state of our collective knowledge about how some ridiculously complicated natural system works and what we can do about some immense problem of human suffering, some little grain of sand added to the sandcastle of the global university, is oversimplified and treated as an amazing breakthrough.
4-h is a very flexible program, which can definitely be bewildering at times, but the flexibility is great for gifted and 2e kids.
of course, by sheer random chance, some kids in this school will manage this system okay.
it’s a plan for oh-so-many last-minute crises when the eldritch horrors that live in kids’ lockers have mysteriously hidden the items they needed to do their homework so that the kid wasn’t able to rescue them before dashing out to the bus.
although some bumbling is inevitable in any volunteer effort, this doesn’t have to create a blind-leading-the-blind race to the bottom.
these are a must for physics or any other course involving diagrams, and really useful for a lot of note-taking enterprises.
for a project, often you’re handling many different pieces or chunks of paper, but the order of them not only doesn’t count, it is often really helpful to be able to move them around, spread them out on the table, mix and match, look at various things at the same time, and so on.
plus, a lot of providers seem to think that “gifted” means “fiscally gifted,” and they see us as high-functioning clients who are likely to provide a nice revenue stream (as tom lehrer said, they think they’re specializing in “diseases of the rich“), so they advertise claiming this as a specialty area.
to reduce costs, try just aregular half-sheet 3-ring binder, for which you can buy refills (check that they’re compatible in hole placement!) or print/chop/hole-punch your own.
we work together to develop and troubleshoot systems for corraling all those loose papers, books, notebooks, projects, etc.
in order to prevent the crises when events collide, it really does help to have a system that everyone can use.
i like side-loading ones best, because it’s easier to get a glimpse of what’s on the papers.
the problem i have with this system is that it’s usually hard for kids to write in these, just because they’re not in the kitchen when most of the information they need to write down is given to them.
well, my own beloved little bird is about to embark upon middle school (cue the scary music), and the good news is that she is pretty run-of-the-mill in terms of keeping track of stuff — no worse than most kids her age.
they’re thicker plastic than most, and they have elastic on the corners so they close and open easily, none of that mucking about with noisy velcro or time-consuming string.
(personally, i have a comic-villain evil laugh that i reserve for such situations.)
personally, if you can afford to implement it, i favor the electronic solutions, because they offer some advantages that are hard to duplicate in paper form.
i suggest that kids plan in liberal amounts of “slush time,” planning a set of benchmarks that keeps them comfortably ahead of schedule, to deal with the inevitable complexities and delays that arise.
consultation, financial support, classes for kids and parents, all sorts of nice stuff.
that’s good, because in real life, we are all captains of our own teams.
it can handle some level of hierarchy, although for most complex tasks, i think it’s okay to maintain the separate assignment sheet the teacher handed out, or the separate outline you created for yourself in something like omnioutliner or freemind (more on that below).
if you are not forced to do otherwise, you should routinely use pale-lined graph paper filler (something likethis) for everything in math and science classes.
also, sometimes you want to toss a small book or workbook right into the pile (and might be tempted to shove papers into the book in order to corral them.
i’m pretty tuned in to such things (having had a fairly typical gt-kid childhood, i’m actually more like “hypervigilant about such things”), and i haven’t heard any of the typical “catty” comments about how someone is too young, or taking too many prizes, or making other kids feel bad, or should let someone else have a turn at winning, or must have gotten inappropriate help from a grownup, or whatever.
a whiteboard that shows two months is okay, but i tend to prefer systems that allow the entry of information arbitrarily far into the future and don’t require periodic recopying.
but, as i tell my own kids, unless something is bleeding or on fire, chances are good that this isn’t an emergency.
now think about most appointment books: they show you your day in terms of half-hour blocks.
it’s a therapeutic high school on the campus ofmclean hospital, one of the world’s premier psychiatric hospitals.
very helpful for breaking the isolation and processing one’s own experiences of growing up gifted.
besides having some very goodarticles on the social-emotional experience of giftedness, they train facilitators to run local parent support groups.
you can use an ordinary monthly calendar, or whatever other calendar system is both easy for everyone to write in and easy for everyone to check.
see, some of us have brains that, well, we think best in piles and networks.
(even the judges for the cloverbuds (kids ages 5-7) are told not to just say, “nice job!”)
looking mainly for symptom relief, but for a client who needs a long-term mentor relationship, the respondents in my study were pretty clear on the topic… they need to be pretty smart.
but it’s probably just as well to put that stuff in the pocket designed for it in the backpack.
1 three-ring binder, 1.5″ thick, with side pockets (because handouts fall out of them so much more easily than out of those pesky pocket folders), 10 tab dividers, 25 sheets of lined paper, and 3 pens or pencils (for health.
kids who show promise in these areas get noticed and encouraged to take on more responsibility.
the club (or other voluntary subgrouping) might do things together, but kids do lots of things on their own.
it can also be helpful for kids to ask the adults in their lives to share their impressions — chances are good that no one vision of a kid will be perfectly accurate, but when diverse sources start to give convergent data, that’s something to take seriously.
what i think is most helpful is for those kids to have ongoing mentor relationships with adults in the field, folks who will honestly answer questions and suggest routes by which kids can meaningfully explore and pursue their passions.
last thing (at least until i think of another one): you need to have a system for offloading the content of the pcd as the project shifts focus.
so i tend to be in the mode of blaise pascal’s famous quote (often attributed to mark twain), “i wrote you a long letter, because i didn’t have time to write you a short letter.”
usually schools have good intentions in doing these — they’re honestly trying to teach kids organizational skills.
all offer low-cost methods for kids to take out-of-level achievement tests (because they’d hit the ceilings of grade-level achievement tests, of course!), qualifying them to take courses designed for gifted kids.
real scientists never enter a lab.
this is a great thing for them to learn to do, and a nice well-constructed venue for them to learn to do it in.
if you go to hoagies (of course), there is a list of mailing lists and ways to get in contact with other parents: http://www.hoagiesgifted.org/on-line_support.htm.
well, my own beloved little bird is about to embark upon middle school (cue the scary music), and the good news is that she is pretty run-of-the-mill in terms of keeping track of stuff — no worse than most kids her age.
(since i work primarily with gifted andmultiply-exceptional kids, they tend to be able to understand this information at very young ages, and they tend to be very upset when they are aware of people talking about them without seeking their input.)
you’ll take ten minutes, tops, to go through the binder and the backpack and find all of the papers in those folders plus any stray calves.
highlighting is almost completely useless as an active reading strategy for most people — it makes you feel like you’re doing something, but what you’re typically doing is a very surface-level syntactic analysis to find the key phrases without actually processing the information.
don’t worry about order within the rings unless you like to do it — i’d rather see you be consistent about doing a pretty good job than be perfect but never quite get around to it.
start with a simple backpack or tote.
kids need real information about what those people really do all day, what the life is like, what personality characteristics and working styles are good fits for it (and which are not!).
even if the child is not eligible (i always have to remind people who come to me for testing that by the math of the normal curve, 96% of kids above 130 are *not* above 145), ditd has somepublic-access bulletin boards with useful information and discussions as well, and adatabase of articles on specific topics.
cognitive-behavioral techniques can be really usefulas tools, but a flexible and collaborative approach is going to be key.
(oh, look, there’s a teen version — i haven’t read it yet, but i’d consider that a good bet as a starting point) can help structure some aspects of the exploration.
these are used for things like course syllabi or assignment sheets, reference sheets for generic assignments (e.g., “requirements for writing up a problem of the week”), or other important long-term reference material (a periodic table for chemistry, etc).
it likes to collect lots of interesting little things (binder clips, staplers, etc), but we’re back to william of ockham there – if you don’t need it, get rid of it.
and, admittedly sometimes the systems are for the convenience of the teachers — e.g., they want to be able to collect notebooks and take them home to check that kids are doing their work.
if a kid cannot behave in the meeting or tolerate having all of those grownups talking about them or about their situation, okay, fine.
we’re often doing this in whatever teeny bits of wiggle room we can find within the “systems” imposed upon them by their schools.
first, it protects the binder and the papers in it from getting destroyed when something else is shoved into the backpack.
carolyn k curates probably the largest single pile of links to all things gifted.
we work our whole lives to become, if we’re lucky, managers of sorts.
the zip-binder usually has a zip pocket that can hold pencils and pens and anything else needed.
need to read every book out there — there’s not going to be that much new information once you’ve read one.
too much empty air and paper being carried around.
yes, that’s the potential downfall of living life in the pile zone.
volume can be high at times — try using your mail program to sort messages into a folder, and if you get behind by a week or more, don’t feel bad about deleting.
some of the nastiest and most invalidating responses i’ve personally experienced or heard about in my research came from professionals who were themselves very likely to be highly intelligent.
occasionally, if it’s really only a few pieces of paper and the project is really short term, i do grab one of those awful two-pocket paper folders (see, i despise them so much i’m not even making a link) that seem to spawn in my closet (they are refugees, i think, from little bird’s elementary school’s silly ideas about how to teach kids to organize themselves).
separate pencil cases are just more superfluositicalextracalifragilisticity.
these are used for things like course syllabi or assignment sheets, reference sheets for generic assignments (e.g., “requirements for writing up a problem of the week”), or other important long-term reference material (a periodic table for chemistry, etc).
use clear plastic durable slash-folder dividers, like these.
you need to be in the middle ground, where some guidance will help them gradually become able to do it on their own.
somehow, even though open file boxes aren’t all that different from hanging files in a file drawer, the kind normal human beings seem to be able to manage, i don’t lose track of stuff as easily when it’s in open filing like that.
you can use an ordinary monthly calendar, or whatever other calendar system is both easy for everyone to write in and easy for everyone to check.
no kidding — i’ve had to write into kids’ ieps and 504 plans that they had to beallowed to use a bag instead of carrying everything loose.
whatever you choose, losing it will be a time-wasting and anxiety-provoking crisis.
so what we need is a way to interview prospective providers to find out what theyactually know, rather than what they’ll tell you they know.
i have to say that every time i talk with a 4-h kid, even those 5-7-year-old cloverbuds, i am astounded at how well they canhave those conversations with an unfamiliar kid, older kid, or adult.
i cannot find a link to the ones i use — i happened to spot these in a dollar store a few years ago, bought a couple, realized how excellent they were, went back and bought some more, and haven’t seen them in any store since.
i cannot find a link to the ones i use — i happened to spot these in a dollar store a few years ago, bought a couple, realized how excellent they were, went back and bought some more, and haven’t seen them in any store since.
you can do this, and it’s quite an adequate system,if you are really good about keeping dates on pages, and if you are really good about emptying the thing on a very regular basis into the home-based permanent-storage binder, and if you don’t mind that this routine is going to take a little longer because you have to impose order at that point.
another great organization is supporting the emotional needs of the gifted :
i hate to have to say it, but i really do think that therapists who work with smart folks probably should be at least reasonably smart themselves, if for no other reason than so they can follow the logic and metaphor, quick thinking, intuitive leaps, and so on.
i literally can’t find anything when i use time as the organizing principle.
i know this might sound silly, but if your capture system requires a writing implement, then you need a writing implement attached to it, so no time is wasted searching.
teach kids the habit of rechecking the assignment sheet as they go, rather than trying to remember what the teacher expected and when any intermediate due dates might have been.
given that the notebook system they’ve chosen is even worse than i’d feared (i might even need to do another rant!), let’s just say i’m a bit skeptical.
your kid is wonderful and terrific and you are feeling the same awesome responsibility as the custodian of a young life as all good parents do.
knowing a lot of facts about science or having precocious math procedural skills (which is what precocious science-y math-y kids often manifest with) is a great potentiator of creative thought later in life, but it isn’t the same thing.
we attend meetings and send e-mails.
i do get some emergency-type calls (school is in the process of throwing a kid out, kid is emotionally falling apart on a regular basis, etc.), and if that’s the kind of situation you’re in, absolutelysend me a note or give me a call
don’t worry about order within the rings unless you like to do it — i’d rather see you be consistent about doing a pretty good job than be perfect but never quite get around to it.
when papers get into your hands, ideally, they should go into the rings of the binder.
if what you do is terrific, they’ll tell you, but they’llstill tell you how to make it even better.
or they could call me for a short-term professional consultation — i’m thrilled to be able to spread the knowledge here.
since our gt and 2e kids are so often not well-matched to the in-school activities, and because there are so many choices for out-of-school stuff, many of which simply replicate the problems with the typical in-school activities, it becomes crucial for us to think about how we can recognize the subtexts in an activity that will support the kids’ growth.
speaking of the culture of the group, this is one that tends to attract a crowd marked bycuriosity and passion, highly enriched for bright-to-gifted folks.
i also don’t like ones that have a rigid gusset — they’re just asking to get crushed, and they take up too much space when they’re not full.
pay attention not just to the content of the responses, but also to the nonverbal signals and your gut feeling about how they’re responding to the notion.
note that you now already have a “hot folder” system in place.
knowing about your own personal learning and working profile, in its many dimensions (subject for a future post), is important.
the kids there are all there, atenormous school district expense, because they have debilitating major mental illnesses and really honestly cannot emotionally handle being in a regular high school.
it works well in situations where there are a lot of routine things going on, stuff happening on a daily or weekly basis in almost every area of study.
if you are not forced to do otherwise, you should routinely use pale-lined graph paper filler (something likethis) for everything in math and science classes.
cognitive-behavioral techniques can be really usefulas tools, but a flexible and collaborative approach is going to be key.
so my point in making this post?  gifted kids need career guidance.
the day-to-day job of a scientist — a real one — isn’t too different from that of, say, an insurance claims adjuster.
kids are likely to need a lot of guidance in the process of breaking down tasks, keeping track of subtasks, redoing the schedule when things don’t work out the way they planned, and generally keeping any complex project on track (beyond the scope of this already-very-long post).
it has too many moving parts.
highlighting is almost completely useless as an active reading strategy for most people — it makes you feel like you’re doing something, but what you’re typically doing is a very surface-level syntactic analysis to find the key phrases without actually processing the information.
homeschooling?) are created equal, so it’s worth thinking about what would characterize good ones.
(3) stop what you’re doing, sharpen the pencil successfully (which includes not dropping piles of shavings all over the floor when you have to keep opening the thing up to pry yet another broken point out of the razor), remember what it was you were doing, and then get back going again.
no colored pens or pencils.
in fact, the only nice thing i can say about most planner books provided by the school is that they tend to be organized by subject, rather than by time.
i also don’t think that highlighters have much use during the school day.
no paper gets thrown out, even if the teacher says you don’t need to keep it or it’s stupid or whatever.
the printed-out material i’m organizing into the outline for my book (on, perhaps not surprisingly, helping bright-to-gifted folks with executive functioning) is in it right now — each section is a chapter.
in general, gifted folk don’t do as well in rigidly manualized treatments (which are, sadly, becoming extremely popular).
i love to hear suggestions from people about specific topics or questions they’d like me to address, so feel free to comment here or to send me a private email (aimee@davincilearning.org).
if they want to self-educate, the (btw, i would recommend themodels of counseling gifted children, adolescents, and young adults book, edited by jean peterson and sal medaglio, for a professional to self-educate on the topic).
the goal is to help us figure out whowe are and how to act like ourselves, just in an adaptive way.
so part of the goal of the whole process is to train them to be good at the role of team member, and eventually to take on the role of teamcaptain .
at the same time, if you’re running out of filler paper, refill.
when something outgrows an accordion folder, it’s not really going to be particularly portable anyhow.
look for one that has a cover (like the one i linked) to protect the pad from getting trashed.
there’s even a companion cd-rom with customizable forms for the teachers to use.
volume can be high at times — try using your mail program to sort messages into a folder, and if you get behind by a week or more, don’t feel bad about deleting.
sometimes we foreclose too early, other times we wander without direction.
not that you shouldn’t include a note on the day something is due (after all, it will help you remember to hand it in!), but that’s rarely sufficient.
we attend meetings and send e-mails.
when papers get into your hands, ideally, they should go into the rings of the binder.
for those who have read the twisted tale of my life thus far and how i got from being the youngest in my class to being the oldest in my class, finally finishing school (this time for sure!)
consultation, financial support, classes for kids and parents, all sorts of nice stuff.
if you feel like you’re getting a dismissive or hostile reaction,go somewhere else and don’t feel bad about it.
otherwise, your inbox will fill up too fast with stuff that doesn’t need to be in the capture  box and stuff will get lost.
gifted folks are just like everyone else except that we got as in school
the goal is to have one object that handles all of the task-related information and time-related information in as simple a fashion as possible.
i can’t say as i’ve found a bulletproof system for keeping track of tasks (what needs to be done) and time (when it will be done and when it will be completed), but let me at least raise the issues i think need to be considered in the process.
it works well in situations where there are a lot of routine things going on, stuff happening on a daily or weekly basis in almost every area of study.
if you need more help, ask me, ask on the mailing lists, ask on the bboards, ask wherever, and you’ll get lots of help.
sports, music, arts, classes, practice times, religious services, family dinners, parties, company, hang-out-with-friends, tv shows you can’t bear to miss, whatever it is that you spend time on, if you’re going to want to spend time on it and you’re not going to want to do homework during that time, it’s a good idea to put it in the calendar.
if a kid cannot behave in the meeting or tolerate having all of those grownups talking about them or about their situation, okay, fine.
the kid finds out that it’s not what they thought it was and they’d rather go in a different direction in the same field or pursue other passions entirely.
i like side-loading ones best, because it’s easier to get a glimpse of what’s on the papers.
i had one just like this one for years while in grad school the first time — i used letter trays on my desk and just used this lovely portable thing to take notes and hold important pieces of paper (hot-folder items) in the storage box (which also can hold a pencil).
to-do lists are good for managing tasks, while calendars are good for managing time.
they’re thicker plastic than most, and they have elastic on the corners so they close and open easily, none of that mucking about with noisy velcro or time-consuming string.
and a third potential pitfall: when you switch away from that project to another task (as us low-working-memory high-idea-generation types do so often), the pileneeds to get swept back into the pcd.
a single club might have kids from ages 5 to 18.
similarly, in those news stories, the contribution of the lone genius scientist is overplayed, forgetting about the legions of graduate students and postdocs who actuallydo the work, as well as the centuries of giants upon whose shoulders they all stand.
kids whose records are clear, understandable, and comprehensive get recognized forthose efforts, even if the projects were not all that elaborate or impressive.
another potential pitfall: if your system has portable elements, they can get lost and then you have to waste time tearing up the house and screaming about the missing pcd.
(my family needs to know that on a certain day between certain times, i am seeing clients and am therefore unavailable.
same with having occasional visits in the classroom or one-time shadowing experiences — again, the focus tends to be on the gee-whiz aspects of the career, a sales job more than anything else.
getting professional help (from a formal assessment, a therapy relationship, a career counselor familiar with gifted kids (i.e., who won’t just say, “ooh, you’re so wonderful, you can be anything you want to be!”) can provide another helpful outside perspective.
also, i would want someone who in your initial interview seems to have some level of personal empathy with those experiences — they don’t necessarily have to have had them themselves, but it helps if they’re close enough that they didn’t experience their own intelligence as always a positive thing.
birdie likes school and i think she’s getting a good education.
they getreal feedback that is supportive but honest and specific.
personally, since i type rapidly, i often take the time to simply retype those sheets into my computer (or get an electronic copy from the teacher or the website), which eliminates concerns about losing them.
okay, i promised some ideas on planners and how to keep track of assignments.
note that you now already have a “hot folder” system in place.
maybe they always assumed that their kids would be gifted, but had also assumed that there would be clear and easy guidance and help available from the school system.
if you like that size/form factor, try using alarge desktop monthly-organizer pad pinned to a corkboard.
people who don’t know much about brains like to call this a right-brained processing style, or a visual processing style (sorry, both of those concepts would get me laughed out of the cool neuropsych parties — the current research on the topic is much more complex than any such simple-minded dichotomy would support).
i recommend also writing tasks on… the day you’re going to work on it.
1 bienfang notesketch 8.5″x11″ horizontal lines (now there’s an art teacher who knows what she wants.
the concept here is that each pile now has a pigeonhole to go into.
try to find highlighters that aren’t fluorescent (= superstimulating).
you can try asking me privately if i know anyone in your geographical area, and i’ll try, but no guarantees.
if you can get yourself to commit to a consistent location (say, a desk or other workspace, which i’ll have hints for in another post), then the discipline becomes that the pcds always get returned to that location, not just dropped wherever they happen to be when your brain moves on to another task.
separate pencil cases are just more superfluositicalextracalifragilisticity.
i’d be a good grantwriter, i suppose, but ugh, not what i want to actually do for a living.
if you’re looking for some specific suggestions for curricula, toys, books, contests, local groups, you name it, go tohoagies.
i literally can’t find anything when i use time as the organizing principle.
certainly,all kids benefit from high-quality activities.
and you can use them for the active test-taking, too, and they don’t glow.
so they need to capture those ideas — essentially, creating an assignment for themselves to write the information into the family calendar.
it’s a plan for lost and crumpled papers, shoveddeep into the recesses of the backpack until they turn into petroleum products.
if nothing else, having a qualifying score on these is a cheap-and-easy way to get something objective in hand that you can share with your child’s district when they say, “oh, we have lots of kids just like that.”
there are some very good materials available on theseng (supporting the emotional needs of the gifted) website, too.
they’d like me to address, so feel free to comment here or to send me a private email (aimee@davincilearning.org).
certainly, there is a very tiny minority of children who will not be able to handle it, even with guidance and training and practice.
almost any topic is fair game for the projects they work on during the year (it’s not just chickens and zucchini!) and their visual presentations (more on those below).
eventually, kids can do it on their own, but we wait at each step to see that it’s happening reliably before we fade the support.
courses can be expensive but financial aid is available.
for kids in school, that may not be a show-stopper; the times they get told things that need to get into the binder usuallyare the times when that zip-binder will be right with them.
okay, i can’t be too mad about that.
and some other kids will have parental or professional support called into play so as to prevent the worst of the failure.
very helpful for breaking the isolation and processing one’s own experiences of growing up gifted.
it’s not perfect, but it’s nice for situations where writing doesn’t work well (like, say, if you’re driving).
see what works and where the bugs are, solve the problems and improve the system over time.
a whiteboard that shows two months is okay, but i tend to prefer systems that allow the entry of information arbitrarily far into the future and don’t require periodic recopying.
it’s a therapeutic high school on the campus ofmclean hospital, one of the world’s premier psychiatric hospitals.
if you have two different things, then you’re going to (a) put information in the wrong place or in only one of the places (b) look in the wrong place or in only one of the places and thus miss something you need to know.
see what works and where the bugs are, solve the problems and improve the system over time.
each of us creates the tasks we need, but anyone can edit any list.
in this article, a parent of a child with significant learning disabilities writes about how having her son in the meeting provided important information to the iep team about the reality of what was going on in the classroom.
okay, to be fair, i’m willing to guess that a couple of those binders might be destined to live in classrooms instead of traveling back and forth to lockers and home.
if they insist, i adviseplain old medium-point black stick pens, nothing fancy.
asking for and receiving help are seen as good things.
accordion files, of course, have those little divider tabs.
at the tender age of 42, you’ll know that i started life as a starry-eyed molecular biologist.
think about how often this needs to happen in order to be useful (if your deadlines tend to be only a few days after you find out about them, then a weekly process is too slow!), and how you will make sure that you don’t forget to do it.
tell them that it’s not an admission of fault or imperfection that they develop and use a system so that they don’t have to waste brain cycles remembering.)
this is my usual starting organizational system for most kids who go to conventional schools.
good for avoiding collisions and encouraging kids to work on things before the last minute.
a low-tech concept, particularly useful if your planner system is too large to be on your person all the time, is to have an index card jotter (here’san example) to scribble things in.
sports, music, arts, classes, practice times, religious services, family dinners, parties, company, hang-out-with-friends, tv shows you can’t bear to miss, whatever it is that you spend time on, if you’re going to want to spend time on it and you’re not going to want to do homework during that time, it’s a good idea to put it in the calendar.

i have some alternatives, which i’ll cover in another post. categories:executive functioning, surviving school tags: education, executive functioning, organization mommas, don’t let your babies grow up to be… august 5, 2010 aimee yermish 54 comments here’s an article making the rounds, which is funny because it’s so true.
you need to be in the middle ground, where some guidance will help them gradually become able to do it on their own.
then, if necessary, we teach a parent how to watch and cue them, and they do it before our session, so my weekly check is just to see that it’s been done correctly.
if you feel that a certain 16-year-old cannot even meaningfullyparticipate in a meeting that may decide the course of their life, then i would be very, very concerned about that same person at 18 years old having the right to manage all aspects of their life on their own.
i also strongly believe that as soon as the kids are capable of tolerating the experience, they should be members of the team and participate in the meetings themselves.
the concept here is that each pile now has a pigeonhole to go into.

there aren’t any studies yet looking at training programs for psychologists, but my sense of it is that, if anything, the situation is worse, since “gifted education” exists as a distinct field, while “gifted psychology” kinda basically doesn’t.
younger kids, who usually only have one teacher for most subjects which assign homework, can have a single hot-folder in the front of the binder.
same thing with what you will do when a project is completed.
theinstitute for research and policy on acceleration has guidelines.
maybe we’ll get lucky and they won’t hand out a paper planner they’re expecting everyone to use.
i’d have to add the constant stream of news stories in which some tiny incremental improvement in the state of our collective knowledge about how some ridiculously complicated natural system works and what we can do about some immense problem of human suffering, some little grain of sand added to the sandcastle of the global university, is oversimplified and treated as an amazing breakthrough.
some classes may require more than one section (english class is famous for this, with “language arts” and “literature” often being separate areas) — for the secondary divisions,ordinary dividers are fine.
(that’s very different from an overwhelmed teacher assigning a gt kid to tutor a struggling student in school, which has all sorts of rotten social and emotional consequences and is not educationally all that useful for either kid, and which probably should be the topic of another post.)
if i tried to keepeverything in one accordion folder, i’d get sick of carrying it around, and that’s where the danger would happen — i’d take a pile out to take with me somewhere, and it wouldn’t have a pile containment device any more and the uncontrolled piles might escape.
if there are multiple people within a family who might need to look at, add, or change information, electronic systems can be set up to enable this.
pcds need homes to live in.
otherwise, in the office pool for the lifespan of that object, put me down for “under one week.”)
your kid is wonderful and terrific and you are feeling the same awesome responsibility as the custodian of a young life as all good parents do.
the nice thing about this system is that any member of the family can make changes which then everyone can see, and any member of the family can create an appointment for anyone else — i can let little bird know that we have company coming on a certain evening, so she can’t count on homework help then, for example.
the single best thing parents can do for themselves is to break the isolation.
sure, you could use a prettyportfolio, and that’s what i use now for walking-around notetaking-with-clients, but there’s some nice urban chic happening with the aluminum thing.
to reduce costs, try just aregular half-sheet 3-ring binder, for which you can buy refills (check that they’re compatible in hole placement!) or print/chop/hole-punch your own.
if you have an electronic system, think about how you are going to use reminders intelligently.
someone who is at least moderately bright and who is a good listener is okay for a client who is looking mainly for symptom relief, but for a client who needs a long-term mentor relationship, the respondents in my study were pretty clear on the topic… they need to be pretty smart.
then we fade back to having them do it while i watch and cue them when they miss something.
the article is mainly about the fact that the public perception of science as a profession is shaped largely by mad-scientist movies and whiz-bang demonstrations.
then we fade back to having them do it while i watch and cue them when they miss something.
we can’t schedule a meeting if they don’t consent, and we can’t hold a meeting if they don’t show up.
we know that gifted folk are found in every social, ethnic, racial, and economic group, but, well, like i said, a lot of folks don’t know what they don’t know.
another thing i think 4-h does really well is, tied in with the high-standards thing, encouraging kids tobuild transferable life skills .
this is my usual starting organizational system for most kids who go to conventional schools.
people certainly notice a particular person earning a lot of awards, but it’s generally with a sense of frank admiration for the effort and skill they know the kid put in.
homeschooling?) are created equal, so it’s worth thinking about what would characterize good ones.
if you do your work basically at your desk, then try a whole bunch of horizontal letter trays, or a mail sorter (obviously, both of those items can be found in stylish versions, too, but i’m showing cheap-and-ugly options).
now think about most appointment books: they show you your day in terms of half-hour blocks.
you might be surprised how much depth of thought you will hear.
extensive assignment sheets (for major projects) usually belong in page protectors (each page in its own, please, so that you can read them easily, don’t stuff a multi-page stapled thing into something that will require you to take it out to read the inside pages!), placed in the rings at the beginning of the relevant section of thebinder.
see, i have a crappy working memory ™, which means that if i don’t capture an idea within about ten seconds, it will be gone gone gone.
kids are likely to need a lot of guidance in the process of breaking down tasks, keeping track of subtasks, redoing the schedule when things don’t work out the way they planned, and generally keeping any complex project on track (beyond the scope of this already-very-long post).
some kids are just good at piling up facts.
the low-tech version, of course, is the official family calendar, located at some central place in the household (usually the kitchen).
either once a month, or at the end of every multi-week unit, take out everything that is not from the current month/unit or the immediately previous month/unit, and put it in the big d-ring binder at home.
i strongly dislike traditional wood pencils.
second choice would be someone who can at least spontaneously admit that they are not knowledgeable in the area but would be interested in self-educating.
because although i knew intellectually that science was a lot of hard work and a very long process, some little part of me still held onto the magical belief that you had a brilliant idea on monday, did the experiment on tuesday, got data (cells gotta grow overnight) on wednesday, published on thursday, and on friday were on the plane to stockholm.
we can’t schedule a meeting if they don’t consent, and we can’t hold a meeting if they don’t show up.
enter the pile-containment devices: letter trays, portable pockets, accordion folders, and the like.
otherwise, you will just have a whole pile of undifferentiated piles, and you will eventually start shoving things in randomly because you aren’t sure what goes where, and you will waste time trying to find the pile you were looking for, so you’re back to piles of piles of messy piles.
size: you could, i suppose, use 8.5″ x 11″ sheets, whether purchased or homebrewed, and integrate this right into the front of the traveling zip-binder i describe inthis post.
there should be no blank paper anywhere in the binder except for those sections.
to avoid the problem, i make it my personal goal to get rid of those pieces of paper as soon as possible by entering the relevant information into my system.
if they need to have an educational advocate, therapist, adult friend, or other non-parental helpful person sitting next to them to help them understand what is going on and to help them figure out how to express their own ideas appropriately, then that’s a great service to provide for them.
i also don’t think that highlighters have much use during the school day.
reading biographies of famous individuals, particularly those written for younger audiences, doesn’t help all that much, i’m afraid.
plus, a lot of providers seem to think that “gifted” means “fiscally gifted,” and they see us as high-functioning clients who are likely to provide a nice revenue stream (as tom lehrer said, they think they’re specializing in “diseases of the rich“), so they advertise claiming this as a specialty area.
if a kid has iq and achievement scores both above 145, there are some great opportunities available through thedavidson institute for talent development.
no kidding — i’ve had to write into kids’ ieps and 504 plans that they had to beallowed to use a bag instead of carrying everything loose.
all offer low-cost methods for kids to take out-of-level achievement tests (because they’d hit the ceilings of grade-level achievement tests, of course!), qualifying them to take courses designed for gifted kids.
don’t back off all at once, or they will have no idea where to go or what theycould or should expect from themselves.
i don’t like flimsy clear-poly pockets — they feel like they’re not going to hold up, and they aren’t stiff enough to protect the papers well.
i’ve heard consistent reports from gt clients that if they weren’t able to leave therapy (many child or adolescent clients don’t feel they have much choice in the matter), they were highly successful not just in stonewalling, but in outright snowing therapists who they felt didn’t empathize with them effectively (my favorite was the tweenaged client who structured her play so as to make her therapist come to certain interpretations).
i’ve had the same one for years, because i really cannot manage more than one project of accordion-file magnitude at a time (“knowing your limits” being another important aspect of executive functioning).
by the way, i have known some school-age kids to use an accordion file instead of the traveling zip binder, where each section is a class, and there’s one section at the front for hot-folder items.
for another instance, when i was working on the literature review for my dissertation, there were piles and piles of papers on various topics.
and siblings (even annoying little ones!) to stick around and participate.
(i have personally see this play out, at times tragically, in a few situations, where a newly-minted legal adult made decisions that were mostly informed by their lack of experience.)
you might be a bit hypersensitive, sure (i see that a lot, especially from adult gt folks who had educationally or socially traumatic experiences in childhood), but in the shrink biz, they teach us to pay attention to those feelings.
but if you don’t know what your own strengths and weaknesses are, you can neither think about how your current style might match up nor think intelligently about what you might want to develop about yourself in order to become a better match.
because we need to break the social isolation of the kids, too, i also strongly recommend sharing with administrators if they’ll let you: winebrenner, s., & brulles, d. (2008).
because this structure doesn’t have a lot of rules around age or status,anyone who knows something can be a valid teacher .
planning work time also requires kids to predict how long they think a task or subtask will take… and thus provides a good opportunity for them to also track how long somethingactually took, so that they can become more accurate predictors in the future.
they should also volunteer information that fell into a kid’s blind spots, stuff they didn’t even think to ask about.
it can also be helpful for kids to ask the adults in their lives to share their impressions — chances are good that no one vision of a kid will be perfectly accurate, but when diverse sources start to give convergent data, that’s something to take seriously.
i also strongly believe that as soon as the kids are capable of tolerating the experience, they should be members of the team and participate in the meetings themselves.
loose slips sink ships.
we’re often doing this in whatever teeny bits of wiggle room we can find within the “systems” imposed upon them by their schools.
but they won’t learn how to do it without guided practice.
another thing that 4-h does very well is to encourage kids to improve over time and meet meaningful quality standards .
frequently, you can get rid of a lot of the intermediate materials, and then you need some sort of long-term storage for the stuff you want to keep.
if you get push-back instead of thoughtful dialogue, just thank them nicely and walk.
but it’sparticularly important for gt and 2e kids, because they all too often don’t get enough of the self-efficacy and empathic mirroring / accreditation experiences that most kids get in school.
kids are also encouraged to participate in leadership and community service projects, again often taking on organizational roles that one might assume are only for older kids.
another reason why it helps to have someone reasonably smart so that the kid will have a harder time snowing them if they try.
the key is to get something that you can get all of your information into (so that you can trust that everything you need to know is in there), and get all of your information out of… reliably and simply.
but this list is not giving me all the warm fuzzy back-to-school feeling i’m hoping for.
in our family, we manage time with google calendars — we have one for the kids (they might end up with one each when they get older), one for the parents’ public information, and one for each parent’s private information.
and a third potential pitfall:  when you switch away from that project to another task (as us low-working-memory high-idea-generation types do so often), the pileneeds to get swept back into the pcd.
see, i have a crappy working memory ™, which means that if i don’t capture an idea within about ten seconds, it will be gone gone gone.
either once a month, or at the end of every multi-week unit, take out everything that is not from the current month/unit or the immediately previous month/unit, and put it in the big d-ring binder at home.
for each subject, one side of the divider holds papers the teacher has handed out which haven’t gotten into the rings yet, and the other side holds homework (and permission slips, etc) which is completed and not yet handed in.
occasionally, if it’s really only a few pieces of paper and the project is really short term, i do grab one of those awful two-pocket paper folders (see, i despise them so much i’m not even making a link) that seem to spawn in my closet (they are refugees, i think, from little bird’s elementary school’s silly ideas about how to teach kids to organize themselves).
(3) stop what you’re doing, sharpen the pencil successfully (which includes not dropping piles of shavings all over the floor when you have to keep opening the thing up to pry yet another broken point out of the razor), remember what it was you were doing, and then get back going again.
if so, we need acase of glue sticks.
in the fair, first, everything is judged on an arbitrary standard.
the research on client honesty is pretty solid across the board — therapists tend not to know what clients hide from them.
you can design and print your own pages pretty easily in any word-processing software, if you prefer.
note that this is all before we add any textbooks to those backpacks, if you were concerned about weight.
giftedness is treated with a lot of ambivalence in the usa and similar cultures — you’re supposed to have brilliant kids, but whatever you do, don’t talk about them.
otherwise, you will just have a whole pile of undifferentiated piles, and you will eventually start shoving things in randomly because you aren’t sure what goes where, and you will waste time trying to find the pile you were looking for, so you’re back to piles of piles of messy piles.
normally, this district actually does a pretty good job with most things, and even a very good job with some things.
almost without fail, i see kids who speak politely and intelligently, with appropriate social pragmatics, responding thoroughly to questions, and showing their enthusiasm for their work.
they typically getzero training in gifted issues while in teacher school, and what they do get typically just perpetuates the myths.
(oh, look, there’s a teen version — i haven’t read it yet, but i’d consider that a good bet as a starting point) can help structure some aspects of the exploration.
no recriminations, just find the stragglers and round ‘em up, get ‘em in the rings.
also, sometimes you want to toss a small book or workbook right into the pile (and might be tempted to shove papers into the book in order to corral them.
theinstitute for research and policy on acceleration has guidelines.
if you really only have a few things you need to deal with at any given time, and, again, you’re good about offloading things into long-term storage, think about something like acontractor’s clipboard.
for the fair itself, there’s quite a range of things kids can make and exhibit, and there are departments at our local fair which permit written or display entries on virtually any topic (our county had a passionate gt kid and supportive parent who established a writing department about a decade ago).
(i long ago gave up filing “that is neat and i might want it someday” stuff in my filing cabinets, because other than the few really important things, i would tend to forget not just what i named the file it got put in, but eventhat it ever existed at all.)
you can try asking me privately if i know anyone in your geographical area, and i’ll try, but no guarantees.
because we need to break the social isolation of the kids, too, i also strongly recommend sharing with administrators if they’ll let you:  winebrenner, s., & brulles, d. (2008).
in any domain, there are likely to be quite a lot of skills which can be meaningfully taught at an appropriate level by someone who is further along the path, such thatboth teacher and learner are able to meaningfully increase their understanding and skill, and to derive self-efficacy from doing so.
in fact, the only nice thing i can say about most planner books provided by the school is that they tend to be organized by subject, rather than by time.
even if the child is not eligible (i always have to remind people who come to me for testing that by the math of the normal curve, 96% of kids above 130 are *not* above 145), ditd has somepublic-access bulletin boards with useful information and discussions as well, and adatabase of articles on specific topics.
(another nice thing about that, by the way, is that when they get random-people-from-the-public to see how well they’ve done and how well they can present themselves, it becomes another opportunity for them to see that others respect their work.)
see, you can’t teach kids organizational skills just by putting them in a situation where organizational skills would be a really good idea.
gifted folks are just like everyone else except that we got as in school and we’re all just fine.
today’s science demonstration will require a laptop, a printer, and 20 liters of coffee.
second choice would be someone who can at least spontaneously admit that they are not knowledgeable in the area but would be interested in self-educating.
you basically register a phone and an email.
in this article, a parent of a child with significant learning disabilities writes about how having her son in the meeting provided important information to the iep team about the reality of what was going on in the classroom.
use clear plastic durable slash-folder dividers, like these.
and few decisions are truly permanent — you can usually change course later.
if you ever spot it outside one of those places, it needs to get put back in one of its permissible “homes” right away.
the research on client honesty is pretty solid across the board — therapists tend not to know what clients hide from them.
remember, though, that in most situations in which you could make a phone call or send an email, if your electronic device were also your portable brain, then you wouldn’t need to use this.
they can approach the projects at any level of sophistication they like.
(that’s very different from an overwhelmed teacher assigning a gt kid to tutor a struggling student in school, which has all sorts of rotten social and emotional consequences and is not educationally all that useful for either kid, and which probably should be the topic of another post.)
so the activities aren’t just for fun and games — we’re creating the opportunity for a developmental need to be met.
i’m noticing what’s not on the list, too… no mechanical pencils.
if i tried to keepeverything in one accordion folder, i’d get sick of carrying it around, and that’s where the danger would happen — i’d take a pile out to take with me somewhere, and it wouldn’t have a pile containment device any more and the uncontrolled piles might escape.
i suggest that kids plan in liberal amounts of “slush time,” planning a set of benchmarks that keeps them comfortably ahead of schedule, to deal with the inevitable complexities and delays that arise.
some of the nastiest and most invalidating responses i’ve personally experienced or heard about in my research came from professionals who were themselves very likely to be highly intelligent.
if they want to self-educate, the (btw, i would recommend themodels of counseling gifted children, adolescents, and young adults book, edited by jean peterson and sal medaglio, for a professional to self-educate on the topic).
if the writer has bad handwriting or doesn’t like to write, typing is likely to be more legible, particularly at smaller font sizes, and most non-writers don’t mind typing as much.
mentors can also help link a kid up with long-term experiences where they can get their hands dirty and become part of the action, particularly as they move into the teen years.
no paper gets thrown out, even if the teacher says you don’t need to keep it or it’s stupid or whatever.
most kids are not appointment-driven; rather, they are project-driven (for adults, it depends a lot on the type of job you have).
absent certain really seriously exacerbating circumstances, adults have the right to make their own decisions, no matter how foolish.
maybe they always assumed that their kids would be gifted, but had also assumed that there would be clear and easy guidance and help available from the school system.
i had one just like this one for years while in grad school the first time — i used letter trays on my desk and just used this lovely portable thing to take notes and hold important pieces of paper (hot-folder items) in the storage box (which also can hold a pencil).
if nothing is, then nothing gets a blue ribbon and no prizes are awarded, as per previous bullet.
pay attention not just to the content of the responses, but also to the nonverbal signals and your gut feeling about how they’re responding to the notion.
