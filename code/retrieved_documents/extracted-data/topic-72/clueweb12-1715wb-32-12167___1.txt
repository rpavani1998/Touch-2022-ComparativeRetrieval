so maybe you can use this to turn the subject on its head and show adults, who want to learn other languages, why they too can learn as easy as kids.

any sloppy research that comes up on this is arguing against an army of people that disprove it.
fortunately this is not the case for all linguists, and now popular research is backing up what i’ve been saying all along!
embarrassment is a prime motivating factor for human beings (i owe this insight to marvin minsky’s the society of mind, but it was most memorably expressed by david berlinski (in black mischief, p. 129), who noted that of all emotions, from rage to depression to first love, only embarrassment can recur, decades later, with its full original intensity).
just keep in mind that i’ll delete any comments  that: 1.
as far as i’m concerned this is totally irrelevant research,as well as being unhelpful.
your own adventures are examples of the first two points.
she also claims that age one is where we can can  no longer distinguish foreign sounds any more; “you and i can’t do  that… we can discriminate the sounds of our own language, but not those  of foreign languages”.
after some focused training, and sometimeseven just a few seconds of paying attention, and you’ll hear it.
in some cases, it’s harder and takes a wee bit more time, but it’s definitely not impossible.

———————————– hey benny, i found this summary (http://www.zompist.com/whylang.html) of why typical kids learn languages easier than typical adults, which doesn’t get into fmri research about the brains of kids under 5: “innate abilities aside, children have a number of powerful advantages: 1)
dealing with  a french waiter is nothing compared with the vicious reception in store  for a child who speaks funny.”
i will reply to all comments in any language listed on the  right with the flags.
there is a stupid rumour going around that you can’t learn a language  after a certain age (was it 6, or 12, or 14?
i love reading them you don’t even have to write in english!
this is just ridiculous.
millions of adults around the world learn languages to excellent levels fine all the time.

age no excuse for failing to learn a new language – new  scientist researchers realised that there are crucial differences in how adults vs  children learn and tried to demonstrate it in this research.
in some cases, it’s harder and takes a wee bit  more time, but it’s definitely not impossible.
i don’t like it, but i suppose it is good for me.
older comments jeff winchell
use a commenter name of a business or brand instead of a human being or a spammy temporary disposable e-mail service, or a clearly fake address.
among the worst examples include an otherwise interesting ted talk about the linguistic genius of babies – in it she shows us a bullshit  graph about the “critical period” for learning a language where all hope is lostfrom age 17.
i realize that you don’t like to put yourself in  situations like number 3, but living in a foreign country, i find that even as  an adult, i get #3 from time to time.
i can’t imagine how many people were on the fence, but saw a video like this or read some paper where kids came out on top… in classroom learning, and decided from that to give up, even though they have many many advantages the kids don’t.

but when they get taken seriously by the public, then i have to take a stand  against it.

are unnecessarily nasty and mean to me or any other commenter or otherwise totally inappropriate.

once again, for more  specifics about how i think this works on a broader scale – read my post  abouthow you are not too old to learn a language.
this stuff really pisses me off as the “research” tests in a context and environment thatchildren are bound to win on anyway (such as traditional classroom learning) and doesn’t test in areas that adults would be better at.

adults rarely have to spend much of their time in the company of people they need to talk to but can’t; children can get very little of what they want without learning language(s).3)

the most discouraging ted talk ever i’ve had some frustration with some linguists in the past when they  make remarks that they can’t back up withrelevant research, which serve no purpose but todiscourage learners.
