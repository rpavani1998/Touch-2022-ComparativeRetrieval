children who learn a foreign language at a young age also exhibit better problem-solving skills, enhanced spatial relations, and heightened creativity.exposing your child to a second language while young allows a child to optimize his or her learning potential, helping to shape the brain at its most flexible stage.where adult learners have to work through an established first-language system, studying explicit grammar rules and practicing rote drills, the young learner learns naturally, absorbing the sounds, structures, intonation patterns and rules of a second language intuitively, as they did their mother tongue.where adults have to work through an established first-language system, studying explicit grammar rules and practicing rote drills, the young kids learn naturally, absorbing the sounds, structures, intonation patterns and rules of a second language intuitively, as they did their mother tongue.learning a second language early on encourages flexible thinking and communication skills, helping children consider issues from more than one perspective.younger learners benefit from flexible ear and speech muscles that can still hear the critical differences between the sounds of a second language, as well as reproduce them with native-like quality.children who study foreign language show higher cognitive performance in overall basic skills in elementary school.when learning multiple languages young, the brain is trained to attend to salient information and to disregard non-pertinent information, a skill that later supports better focus, memory, planning and multitasking abilities.in taking advantage of this window of opportunity, young learners enjoy a wide range of benefits: young language learners can acquire native-like fluency as easily as they learned to walk, in contrast to an adult language learner.additionally, research shows that multilinguals have enhanced memory, planning, and multi-tasking skills.older learners lose the ability to hear and reproduce new sounds by age 8-12, according to experts, resulting in a permanent foreign-sounding accent in any language.learning a second language at a young age is cognitively as easy as learning a first language.research shows that multilinguals use more of their brains than monolinguals and outperform monolinguals on creativity tests.parent testimonials the benefits of learning language young young children are uniquely suited to learning a second language.children can differentiate between two languages within the first weeks of life.
