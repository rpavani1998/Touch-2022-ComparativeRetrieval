then i progressed to reciting them by memory.
sometimes though it takes a couple of times of looking it up before it sticks so instead of hauling out the dictionary i write a brief definition of the word in my notebook and then i just quick reference it while im in the act.

look for a dictionary with precise, up to date and adequate definitions.
you may learn faster or slower than the next

it also helps if they have examples of how the word is used contextually or idiomatically.
that has a nice ring to it.

as adults we build up language learning too much in our minds as something hard or think it will be easy and then get discouraged when we dont speak fluently in 30 days.
adults can achieve the same results but it takes time and hard work.
well like i said before it can be used for whatever your personal language learning needs are.
- remembering new words – when im learning new words i try and use them as quickly as possible as long as its a useful word.
fluency is different than accuracy and fluency is achieved when you no longer have to think about what you are saying just like a native.

no one speaks this way.

before the age of 12-15 kids brains are still creating their network of neurons and that means that instead of installing a new language next to the original they are creating parallel paths in their brains that, to them, all mean the same thing and have no distinct difference.
