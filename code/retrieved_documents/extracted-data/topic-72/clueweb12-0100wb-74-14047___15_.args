the pronunciations are great and i can effectively teach my third graders with correct and accurate words and phrases!the ability to hear the right pronunciation is invaluable.i learn new topics everyday and i think it is the best program for people who want to learn a new language.this is a great way to keep her french up and tutor her on the words she doesn't know.this program is great for beginners and i would highly recommend it to my friends.my husband and i have sometimes talked about that it would be fun to know spanish a little better (my husband doesn't know it at all, and i had forgotten most of it) partly because it's a nice sounding language, and also because it is useful in so many countries.i have just enrolled in a basic course so it helps me to learn a bit of french before i attend my course.i do german genealogy and learning german will help me tremendously in translating german to english or english to german.the native speaker is a great help in pronunciation and i like the fact you can slow the speed of the sentence to a pace which suits you.my confidence with my customers at the airport is increasing and i am overjoyed at actually remembering the pronunciations or numbers or words.i have my own consulting company and eventually want to be able to offer instruction in spanish.i am thrilled with what i have learned in such a short time and at how easy i am finding it.when my two children were small, i used a similar approach for teaching them english - drew pictures on one side of the library catalogue cards and letters and words on the other side.even the little ones, age 2 and 3, can play and have fun with it.this way it is easy for a parent to help the child.
