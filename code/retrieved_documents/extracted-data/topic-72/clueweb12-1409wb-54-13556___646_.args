drugs, only tested on animals but having serious side effects, may lead to new medical cures.they provide a vastly cheaper and less time-consuming approach than satellite-based missions and afford an excellent opportunity for student research projects."a textbook licensing model of this kind has the potential for significant universitywide savings, while increasing educational opportunities for more people that can help grow our economy."looking at things in public is part of our right to exist freely in a functioning democracy, and that right includes the right to record what we see or hear.lyme disease is treatable, and the majority of patients recover after receiving appropriate therapy.the study also showed, alarmingly, that life expectancy is falling in parts of the u.s. - usually poor areas with more minorities - apparently because of obesity and other chronic lifestyle conditions linked with poor medical care.but it can make a difference, it provides a dose of healthy food, it re-connects us with the environment and provides a financial incentive to create something other than plain woodlands or endless buildings.the organization's work will enable delivery of a variety of services such as consumer and business internet access, voice telephony (voip), ip-based television, movies on demand, business class videoconferencing, health care services (e.g. in- home monitoring), home and business security, computer backup, public access television, internet radio, and many other advanced services.scientists know how this species responds to pollution, predators, day and night, making it an important model for ecological and evolutionary research.advocates of alternatives to traditional "choose-just-one-person" voting say it does a better job of reflecting the electorate's overall preferences when there are more than two candidates in a race, and reduces certain ills of traditional politicking by forcing candidates to appeal to folks across the spectrum.one advantage of web publishing over old newspaper publishing is being able to respond immediately to reader feedback.hidden cameras in the woods, triggered by motion detectors of various types, have become a major tool in conservation studies, allowing us to take pictures, or make informal census counts, of animals at all times and in secret places.yet people have found so many new places to light that today we spend the same proportion of our income on light as our much poorer ancestors did in 1700, "many have come to believe that new, highly-efficient solid-state lighting â generally led technology, like that used on the displays of stereo consoles, microwaves and digital clocks â will result in reduced energy consumption.the same is true for older adults who acquired natural immunity by being exposed to the disease when it was prevalent.the end product is a better understanding of what genes matter for organisms to cope with environmental stresses like pollutants and global warming and of the technologies necessary to understand how these genes function within an animal that is easily studied in water reservoirs around the globe.
