we were told from early childhood that we were from two cultures and we should pick the best values out of both and create a personal value system that reflected the best of both worlds.(there are good reasons for our responses and behaviors), 2) that for our experiences, there are some new normals, and 3) that as we accept these realities, the great gifts we have also been given by this rich upbringing can be expressed not only on an individual basis but also become part of an example in today’s dividing world of how those who may appear vastly different outwardly can share deeply at some of the most foundational layers of their human experience.she believes that as the tck populations continues to grow, it is important  that for the media and reporters to better understand "how to interpret the significance of the tck childhood and its influence on adult behaviors."she believes that as the tck populations continues to grow, it is important that for the media and reporters to better understand "how to interpret the significance of the tck childhood and its influence on adult behaviors."i believe they were protective of us because they raised us in a non-typical nigerian manner and they knew we would have a difficult time assimilating into the local culture.i have two older siblings and their experiences were very different from mine as they were in much larger institutions of learning and the international body was very diverse.it feels schizophrenic because one part of my brain, personality, tastes, thinking, and perception belongs to this very american life that i live and the other part craves for a basic life of idyllic peace and security that i grew up with.i do feel lonely in this country as i feel very disconnected “from whence i came” and also because it has taken very hard work on my part to consciously create multi-dimensional relationships with nigerians, nigerian-americans, white americans, african-americans, europeans and other africans as well.as the reality of how cultural mixing is changing our world and the individuals in it, perhaps we can begin to find new language and new “normals” so we can help ourselves and others realize 1)however, my parents were very protective of us physically and we did not grow up totally assimilated into nigerian culture.the international body of students were predominantly from south america and due to the language barrier, i found it very difficult to fit in with that group.however, if i begin to talk to you and ask you about your background so that i can put you into a cultural group, i may do a little better in getting to know you before i make a judgment about you.however, the truth is that with our increasing east to access information, travel and knowledge, most people are having third culture experiences on some scale.i spoke yoruba, my nigerian language, but i found it difficult to assimilate fully with nigerians.it really helped me wrap my head around the paths that i have taken in life and why i always end up deep within other cultures other then my own.
