children, unlike adults, learn solely from experience, intuition, and observation and that is why they learn so quickly.these programs are good at what they do, but are not the answer to learning to speak a language fluently.the teacher does not have to be an expert in the language but does need to have a significant understanding of the core concepts and ideas needed to help you progress and learn the language yourself.practicing and building your comfort level, confidence, and intuitive understanding will you gain the agility of a native speaker.languages are a social experience and if your teacher is shy, distant, or not invested then it will make your lessons very tedious and ineffective.as adults learning things academically and systematically are so emphasized that we have lost touch with the part of our brain that learns intuitively and through observation.play a game â€“ kids always play games and will allow you to learn real life speaking skills in a relaxed and comfortable situation.if your teacher cannot say that they have spent a significant amount of time living, speaking, or working with the people that speak the language there is no way they will have the cultural insight to teach you any real life language skills.if you look at other cultures and languages you recognize that everyone that is born into them has been able to learn their language.so in order to learn a new language we need to clean or minds of all the things we think we know and open them up to a way of learning that we have forgotten.in order for any teacher to build lessons that will achieve your goals they must understand your reasons for learning the language.experience knowledge is essential however if the teacher has no practical experience that knowledge is useless.no matter what your opinion is on tv watching it can be an amazing tool for learning a foreign language.yes, you need vocabulary but computers are not yet able to create real life speaking situations that a human teacher can.now depending on your level you can choose more advanced programming but kids programs are a great way to learn a foreign language because they follow the always popular k.i.s.s. method.
