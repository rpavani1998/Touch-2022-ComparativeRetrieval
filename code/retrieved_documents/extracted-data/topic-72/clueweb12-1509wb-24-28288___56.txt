i use desowen lotion often; supposedly it is one of the lowest potent steroids.
the following week lets talk about ointments,  creams, external aids.
the reason it's still used is that it's absolutely necessary to produce a certain type of emulsion; it's not just something that's added, it's something you need when you want to produce a so-called "vanishing cream".

yesterday i went and had some food  allergy testing done and once again nothing.
we started feeding him corn this week, and his back and stomach are broke out again with e. wonder if he's allergic to it?
when allergy testing showed a mild reaction to potatoes, we took her off of that favourite food and her skin cleared up considerably.
i washed his face gently and put some antibiotic cream (neosporin) on it.
the first suggested vitamins he will not  chew.
one week later, with soy eliminated from her diet, and her drinking carnation good start (regular) baby formula and a nondairy product called vitamite, her skin is completely clear!

and in truth, it was  much more effective in stopping the itching than many of the treatments the  doctors prescribed.
and more than you would think do know, and react quite sympathetically.
we prefer this to scratching, but we occasionally  try to break this one up, too, just to make sure he isn't "going  away" to deal with his problem by himself.

it says on the box 'helps improve skin conditions.
my eczema goes from bad to worse to clear depending on a million things.
simply tell them what it is, and if they ask any further, take your business elsewhere.
i'm most inclined to think that it's a case where everything is working together towards the same end cure.
if potency1 is lower than potency2  then time1 is greater than time2.
this works especially well in public places if said in a slightly louder than normal voice.
actually, i'm not altogether sure it was the medicine that calmed me down - maybe just a "quiet cycle".

i tried it on a hunch after having dealt with all the  useless salves and ointments the md had prescribed.
we are all anxious to help our little ones and we all have so  much we can share.
i finally just let him sleep without socks on and kept his nails cut as short as i possibly could.
it's like osteopathy without the force.
it upsets me to think that by  nursing, i was causing his eczema, but it's probably true.
i do manage to keep it under control (it's always worse during winter and during certain times of the month), but i *can't stand* the looks of consternation on my relatives' faces when they see it.

i'm getting married in august, and my grandmother has asked me if i would  like to have her make my dress.
i have gotten many compliments from friends and family on the condition of my facial skin, my eyes (which were typically so bloodshot that it looked as if i had been on an extended bender) and the fact that i look rested.
triludan fyi, i read in the paper that the fda has announced its intent to ban terfenadine, which is the active ingredient of triludan (anti-histamine).
i've used it (or amped up my topical drugs) for less honorable occasions, if ya know what i mean!
that feeling of just not knowing how to put  all the clues together to figure it out is so frustrating.
i have found them at all department stores: bloomingdales, nordstroms,  macy's.
i'm all  for the specific tests he's running...
i'm sure there must be other udder creams/ointments on the american market, but only one product goes by the name "bag balm"...
this is what has worked: what is sarna, is it an over the counter anti-itch, but not a steriod?
it really helps control the flakey, powdery areas for me.
when the last piece of the ugly scabs fell off her face with no signs of scarring, i went out and brought a lottery ticket.(didn't win, never get that kind of luck!)
added benefit: my grocery bills go *way* down.

oddly enough he has no problem with milk and that is usually a big one.
i would not have believed this was true until i experienced it!
before this, she never had  a clear day.

be careful that he does not scratch any particular places on his body regularly though.
from many nights trying to lull bonnie into a state of deep relaxation, and teaching her to use positive imagery to overcome her impulse to scratch, i have a real sense of the helplessness and fear parents of children with eczema undergo.
we have had success  with lamb, turkey, butternut squash, baby food squash, prunes, peas and  spinach.

i shower in the morning and then cover with baby oil and pat skin dry.
when i'm red or itchy i do the "evaporation" thing which seems to help.
you can order the products straight from the company or ask your pharmacist to order them for you.
the bad part is that we had to stop all antihistamines for one week prior, which made for a horrible 7 days, so be prepared for that.
the doctors  finally said daniel had eczema when he was a few months old and in the last few  months we have been seeing an allergist.
i don't know if it was as bad as your experience of course.
i developed eczema after taking an antibiotic.
if the distortion is great enough that spectacles will no longer be adequate, the mainstay of treatment is to wear hard contact lenses (they must be hard lenses - i suspect they will want to fit you with a gas permeable hard lens).
i find bag balm has very little smell to it, and what smell it does have i find "medicinal"...
i was kind of concerned about it being strong and burning his raw spots.
per my contact at phytopharm, information about zemaphyte is sent out to drs in canada when requested.
when i can allow myself to really experience the feelings, i can tell that the comforting sensation of a hand rubbing my back is something i never got enough of as an infant/child.
in the last couple of weeks, we have noticed a change in isaac's skin--i've  even wondered if he even has eczema anymore.
then last thursday i was on a home visit and had drunk a cup of coffee before i realised what i'd done.
the side effects can be nasty, but are rare and are more likely when it is combined with other drugs.
it cleared me up in 2 days but as i started to wean off the medication my eczema started up all over again.
turns out he probably has a viral infection (white blood cell count is up), which could be accounting for why he has so many hives lately.
he's always been sensitive, emotionally, but this physical sensitivity is striking.
if i will do what i must to my diet, i believe i can rid myself  of the problems that i even have now.
at the moment i'm not using cortisone because my skin is pretty much under control except for a few small areas and the usual dry, slightly itchy skin that i don't think will ever go away (i use emollients & zinc for this).
i've also got a suspicion that it helps me tolerate dairy products better - i can't eat them all the time, but the occasional cheese etc doesn't flare me up as it used to.
it's like junk food, empty calories, you keep eating and eating and you're never full.
not knowing she was allergic to soy, we had been giving her soy toddler formula.
but i've been doing everything else  since then too (diet, colloidal minerals, chiro.).
but i use an exfoliating body glove on the rough dry spots.
he also recommended other  vitamins but i am still in search of something he can chew or tollerate.
doctors caution that it might have a drying effect, and should be used carefully as should all stuff we put on our skin.
many, many foods make his face red and  blotchy as he eats (he's not too neat).
they come in dark colors and prints that hide stains from scratching and weeping.
the killer is that these things are available for sale  widely and that you can't check people haven't got the other drugs it interacts  with.
we are trying to distinguish between foods that isaac's skin is sensitive to, and ones he's actually allergic to.
besides my husbands e and allegies, we have a nephew with bad asthma, and my husband's great grandfather had asthma also.
i've tried various bleaching creams & retina a to get rid of it but those products only irritated my skin which makes the problem worse, if anything.
you know that i'll be the first to try it, no matter how badly it puts me financially "in the hole."
the no-grain day included other nice carbos, but it was tough on quinoa and amaranth day--we did/do a lot of baking with those grains, and it's tricky...

my wife has made a number of herbal salves and we have talked to numerous homeopathic doctors and herbalists.
in keratoconus, because of the corneal irregularity, light rays entering the eye are bent in odd ways, which blurs the image and reduces the sharpness of vision.
i don't think it is widely-used because there were only two  bottles on the shelf and they look like they've been there for a while.
i took isaac to the pediatrician yesterday because he'd developed new spots  on his chest--a new kind of spot he hasn't had before--not even hive-ish.
good wishes to all, and i believe that copious amounts of love for our afflicted ones and their caregivers really does help and really does matter.

there is a company called "national allergy supply, inc." 1-800-522-1448 that markets a test that you can order for $25.
we got it because the dr. said he would be a mess if he got chicken pox on top to the eczema, just a thought i know some people don't like that vaccine.
i wanted to kill myself for letting all that happen to  her.
if your child is in fact actually allergic to corn it might be worth mentioning that corn products are in a zillion foods--due to corn starch and then corn syrup used as a sweetener.
looking forward to everyones response.
i've had a look at http://www.fda.gov and found nothing on it, but that may  be because i didn't know where to look and the search engine didn't work.
i've just started her on flax seed oil, which is kind of similar to evening primrose oil.
nothing else is as satisfying as scratching.
when i was a child i took so much medicine for my allergies, eczema and a chronic allergic bronchitis (i had a deep mucousy horrible cough which i never found out the cause of but it went away as mysteriously as it came).

for example, when isaac's skin was terrible, by  age 8 or 9 months, our doctors assured us that he was "atopic," (we  both had allergies as kids; my husband still has them), and that it was very  likely that he'd a) be in the 40% of babies who kept their eczema for their  whole lives; and b) develop athsma when he got older.

twice this has happened to me -- and this'll be my second dermatology appointment!
for those of us who have often wished we could go out with a paper bag over our heads (and for everyone else, too), i heartily recommend reading lucy grealy's book autobiography of a face -- her story of growing up with a facial deformity.

i found out when bonnie was 3 months old that she was suffering from allergic eczema.
i'll see if i still have the files.
when allergy testing  showed a mild reaction to potatoes, we took her off of that favourite food and  her skin cleared up considerably.
i believe diet is a major factor, as well as regular bathing.
when i suggested them one time while talking with him, he shrugged them off.
i had very few reactions to foods, just swordfish.
i  hope your patch test shows something.
about a week ago there was a discussion on aqueous cream and there were some people wondering exactly what was in it; it was found to contain emulsifying wax and people wondered what that was...

i have to say, *all* who saw it didn't flinch and  seemed quite at ease with it.
ultimately, he has managed to lose much of the weight  (and she's quite proud of him for it!), but it had nothing to do with her  harassment and everything to do with finding a way to do it that he could live  with.
welcome sue (& isaac)
the formula he is recommending is the most expensive stuff on the market.
i would say he is ok now - at least he is not bloody in the morning - he still has his eczema on his hand/foot.
thanks for making me feel  like i'm not alone.
for dave, however, understand that this is a very treatable eye condition.
there  is a company called "national allergy supply, inc." 1-800-522-1448  that markets a test that you can order for $25.
first of all, we find eczema on different parts of the body signifies different causes.
i just wanted to second her itch,  if i may.
this is a british cookbook (thorson's publishing group), and i have not seen it in the us for years!
but i suppose all e sufferers share something in common.
incidentally, i'm intending to confront him with my need/desire to find a permanent solution to this -- i want him (or someone he could refer me to) to help me track down the triggering allergen(s).
daniel's skin was better during the summer.
i just include this history to let you know some of the things i noticed with my two children, and a couple of strategies that worked for us.
for this  reason, it's recalled from the market.
i always wear make-up.
but no problems so  far (she had several ear infections until she was two but now can blow her nose  and has never has another).
pick a time when  there are no other distractions and he can give you his full attention.
so whatever the reason, i'm thrilled!
that way they both get the attention they need.
and avoiding the antibiotics and steroids.
thank goodness for pyrithione zinc.
and i went 18 years without any e symptoms and now i have it again
unlike manual breast pumps, the industrial pump is very gentle on your skin and does the job really quickly.
so it's good for everyday- around-town use.
has anyone else heard about antihistamines causing long term problems?
from: debbie subject: non-irritating detergent i use bold free with an extra rinse cycle.
don't give it up just because your dr asks you to.
there are foods katie avoids because they "make her tongue tingle" but no severe reactions have surfaced.
it is your problem, not theirs, and is none of their business.
said she was really, really tight in the shoulder blade area, also has said she is making incredible progress--except for one session where he said she went downhill a bit.
i know doctors can sometimes be pretty blithe about their recommendations, not thinking through the whole picture and just concentrating on fixing the portion of the problem you've presented them with...
the prednisone did a great job
but if i could have gotten over the hurt from his manner, and enlisted my husband's help in figuring out a new diet (instead of feeling defensive because he agreed with the guy's recommendation), it probably would have helped isaac.
i am staying away from wheat, dairy and eggs, too, but here is my cereal.
thanks for making me feel like i'm not alone.
and i think it had paprika
i think that the same thing happened to isaac--i was drinking lots of milk, and eating lots of peanut butter, when i was breastfeeding him, and i was making him sick.

or here online with the group.
i have all of them although my eczema is limited to my hands.
in addition to this, we've once again been using a slight amount of topical cortisone behind the knees (knees and neck often keep her itching all night) and a dose of antihistamine.

when my mum suggested something  with a low back or no sleeves, i just said, "well, i don't know how my  skin will feel that day, and i'd be happier in a different dress."
he seems to know what he's talking about,  i think he's scared of overwhelming us though with too much information.
i use the periactin when he has a bad flare up, it does help.
sue and faith-----our first dr. said of daniel's bad skin----he just has  eczema, like his dad.
since my level was low they thought that it may have had an effect on my hormones and adrenals.
sometimes i think that my eczema is really everyone else's problem nearly as much as it is mine because they have to look at it -- and on your wedding day, it's their tough luck.
when i was young, the ocean was wonderful for my skin.
here's what i found on ribomunyl, at http://www.ccr.jussieu.fr/cgi-bin/fwidal3.pl?ribomunyl ribomunyl.
most of my hive attacks have been of no consequence.
if not, he said  something that i noted immediately -- "we'll just have to call it eczema,  and you'll just have to live with it".
i think the midnight scratch-fests and constant irritation sapped my energy reserves over the years.
obviously he hasn't ever had it -- because if he had, he would know it's nothing to joke about!
when i was young my dr said that the skin could absorb it better.
at the moment i'm not using cortisone because my skin is pretty much under  control except for a few small areas and the usual dry, slightly itchy skin  that i don't think will ever go away (i use emollients & zinc for this).
brian's derm was quite blunt -- she wanted me to stop  nursing that very day!

the last time i went dancing, one of my partners backed  away when he felt my hands (strategically bandaged!) and said "i have to  ask... is that contageous?"
i used to take it religiously and i will probably start that again because i think it's helpful.
ii know there are other things one could do, involving minerals and  vitamins.
as for the other routine stuff, i also use tide free, double rinse... hot  water bedding... no antibiotics (she either had a bad reaction to keflex at 7  mos.
no one seems to have them or even know what  they are.
well, now that you mention it, yes, at one time i *did* use my teeth to  scratch myself, and did so quite regularly up until about a year ago (when i  started trying to take care of the stuff... by simply not scratching even  though it about drove me out of my mind, as well as experiments with vitamin  supplements.
all i can find about eucerit is that it's a special form of lanolin/wool wax  alcohol.
i'm one of those opto-wozzisname blokes, so i can fill this in some.
the other day my husband was in restaurant with daniel and a man gave him his card and recommended trying enzymes.
it is scented and full of those strange chemicals.
if lace isn't good for some reason, then experiment with other light materials to cover up yet be cool.
it's weird but with me everything is connected; all stresses on my body effect the eczema.
eczema is just a part of who you are, and you are certainly more than  eczema (one would assume your beloved didn't make his decision to propose based  on how much you itch!).
the allergist says daniel will most likely outgrow  the food allergies all but eggs and peanuts, but by the time he is 4 or 5 will  become allergic to airborne allergins.

our dr. never said nursing caused e (i nursed just 5 and 1/2 mos) but  daniel was always broke out.
i do agree with the idea of changing your diet.
and i have stopped using lotion/cream-type moisturizers.
so, kim, the disks aren't effective for the real life dirt of active families.
red wine is a problem, white wine much  less, and any alchoholic beverage has some irritation.
i use the deep cleansing shampoo first, then either of the others.
eating lots of peanut butter, when i was breastfeeding him, and i was making  him sick.
i have tried several of the supplements and creams suggested by this list, and my condition has improved considerably.
i discovered this while using desowen lotion- after using it on my face &  other areas of my body for over a year.
my problem is that i  cannot financially afford the dosage that it asks.
you might ask your pharmacist if s/he can order it; my dermatologist suggested it to me.

our theory is that his eczema/scratching is in  part his way of dealing with emotional challenges, and that he scratches  because it distracts him from the confusion/fear/pain he's feeling about  something in his life.
i've been noticing a 3 day cycle to the "bad" times.
at least, that is what i have noticed, though i am probably wrong, but at least that is my observation.

btw: i agree that if you tell people you have eczema, more often than not  they say things like,
i would put money on a bet that in the  next twenty years, they will find that antibiotics and steroids contribute to  the progression from eczema to athsma...
so i would recommend being up front with someone like a dressmaker or sales clerk -- their job is to help you find a dress to let the inner beauty shine through, and i expect they will all have good suggestions for your outer looks as well if you let them know what you're up against.
i also wanted to comment on the food allergy issue... for those of you who have kids who are "allergic to everything," or for whom it seems that way.

jodi developed full body contact dermatitis.

i find that the best thing for me from my wife is that she just accept that i am constantly in motion touching here and scratching there.
i think the leaky guy syndrome is one example of a  cause--if substances are leaking into the wrong body cavities and causing  problems, then the body will manifest this problem with eczema, maybe.
i takes the burn out of my skin and also  seems to promote the healing.
my dermatologist asked me to stop nursing last week  asap ...
i tried them anyway, and i have had  great success.
my son was diagnosed with this at 4 months old.
any way, i wanted to get some feedback from the group.
one more thought: he didn't happen to be on any antihistamines in his system at the time of testing, did he?
the only soap she could use was glycerin, clear, unscented.
i like having the communication even if it is 2:00 a.m.
he then tested positive to potatoes and soy, but his last test came up negative.
remembers when he was a toddler that he use to take a receiving blanket and  wrap it around his arms so he wouldn't scratch too hard.
you made it much easier to get through the day.
he will get better on his own.
i can't promise they'll help you, but they seem to have done the trick for me.

i'd say that eczema will be the least  of your problems once you're married, but then i'm divorced so my outlook might  be a shade jaded!
many plants, trees, dust and molds had catastrophic reactions.
so if you need it for anti-bacterial cleansing i would not use it daily if you can avoid it.
i tried a 100% pure glycerin soap and had a reaction.
these are the same 3 weeks she's  been clear.
around 10:00 that evening he had rice cereal with bananas (and a bottle of formula, of course) --

i am throwing  it out as i have not seen seafood being mentioned here.

now, of course, they attribute his improvement to pure aging--he "grew out of it."

my second pet peeve is people who with all the authority in the world announce that it is stress-related.

though jodi's  e is not a result of milk protein or milk sugar, i think it's worth testing to  see if your e baby is allergic to cow milk or soy by replacing regular formula  with alimentum or if you nurse, try avoiding all products with milk protein or  milk sugar or soy if you could.
julia's face has always been the worst.
they were all ok, not great.

sometimes i can skip one day but only when my skin is in good condition.
she was raw, red, oozing, bleeding on her face and it started spreading more to neck, wrists, legs, and elbows.
i hope you agree with me.
the theory is that your body knows how to heal itself, and practitioners just provide that little boost of energy to kick start the process.
for example, when isaac's skin was terrible, by age 8 or 9 months, our doctors assured us that he was "atopic," (we both had allergies as kids; my husband still has them), and that it was very likely that he'd a) be in the 40% of babies who kept their eczema for their whole lives; and b) develop athsma when he got older.
hello again i am finding all this very interesting because all these children sound  just like my son daniel.

great suggestions for the more gourmet palate... and lots of sauce and stock recommendations.
they carry many egyptian cotton things, and i think sheets are on that list.

i would recommend that you bathe him very often in warm water (hot  water will irritate the skin usually, and cold is unbearable) during the  summer, as the dirt irritates the skin, causing itching.
i highly recommend getting all siblings involved to whatever degree possible.
when my eczema is really active, the medicine, while it does help, doesn't calm it down the way it looks right now.

corneal transplantation is only needed if the cornea is so badly deformed that it is impossible to fit a contact lens, or if there is scarring due to the keratoconus that obscures the central vision - that is clearly the minority of patients.
or maybe i will, and  do a comparison test.
two or three days a month i spend raging around my house, my mind going 100 miles an hour, going over and over and over my notes, articles, the labels of foods and vitamins, just trying to find the thing i missed that will make the whole picture make sense.

i ask her from time to time, how she can stand it.
and frankly, now that i think about it... there are some other things he has done in the past that have taken my mind off the scratching, too...  :) :)
it's like the newton law of physics that says  "every action has an equal and opposite reaction."
i began these products for a week and then again attempted to wean from  prednisone.
i have caught up on literally years of sleep.
so, she had 9 clearing days (with only 2 actual days of "looking" clear since she started out as mess), then went downhill for 3 days (but not too bad at all really) and now has been going back uphill for the last 3 days.
after investing a million dollars and hours in vitamins, blood tests  and every other possible natural cure, i think they are it.
he seemed to be happy that i figured out (or at lease i think i figured out) one of the culprits but he also seemed a little embarrassed (or maybe even mad).
also, with wedding dress-shopping in particular, there may be emotional baggage aggravating the e. (been there!).
we were trying aveeno for our daughter's flare ups, as a substitute for cortisone, and trying a vegetable based vaseline-like product for a moisture barrier.
the  only thing jodi has benefited from is chinese herbal treatment.
i've been using various cortisone creams, ointments... my whole life.
i use them every day on any affected areas and it seems to help it heal and keep it from coming back.

he's the author that speaks about leaky gut... and says along with it there seems to be a little trouble with elimination (recommends enemas or high colonics on a fairly regular basis) and talks about specific spinal misalignments (different ones for psoriasis vs. eczema) and specific recommendations for diet and supplements and topical agents.
i can't imagine having it all over my body.
steroids scare me alot and we are trying all new things we've been reading about here.
i just went to the dermatologist last night
and of course, my skin hasn't looked that good  since!
though it is not one of the most pleasant things in the world, it is not as bad for the skin in my opinion as just plain scratching.
not easy for a control freak like me.

after sending my posting about ointments vs.  creams, i got that uncertain feeling and went to check my elocon tube.
she was absolutely miserable.
cetaphil is an apparently very hypoallergenic solution.
my pet peeve is people who act as if the rash is my fault somehow, as if i rolled in poison ivy or something.
i also may note that the lecithin may be causing more harm than good (i am experimenting with it).
the anticholinergic effects of terfandine may be increased by drgus which  have anticholinergic effects.
but the sea is great (after i've plucked up enough courage to go in there, with everyone looking at my legs like they're leprous).

also, i am on an anti detergent kick, i remember kaye was going to try those disks to use in the washing machine.
i takes the burn out of my skin and also seems to promote the healing.
i did find a couple of press releases from the manufacturers and everything is of course all right ;)
i've been  using j and j new sensitive skin formula baby shampoo
it looked alot nicer and that was before we learned of his food allergies.
for example, would he find it helpful if you constantly said,  "lose weight!"
my herbalist pals tell me milk thistle supports and repairs  the liver.
allow the kids to bring their natural playfulness into the experience.
whether or not it is safe is relative to your  point of view regarding the long term effects of using steroids.
said she was really, really  tight in the shoulder blade area, also has said she is making incredible  progress--except for one session where he said she went downhill a bit.
a lot of my co-workers cannot use it either and they don't have eczema.
i like  the suggestion someone made of getting a backrub to take one's mind away from  the scratching!
thank you for bringing the ingredient list to our attention!
b-v is a cream, while ultraval is an ointment, kind of like vaseline.

again, this is only my way of treating the problem, and it differs from person to person; depending on allergies, etc.
also, how did you try the evening primerose oil and cod liver oil -- orally or open capsule and apply to skin?
i have had rashes, pityriasis rosea and  eczema.

about baby scratching, we had a hard time on this one.
recent  research has shown that when combined, these two medications can cause fatal  changes in heart rhythm.
i pretty much like our allergist.
i noticed that when i thought my eczema was some horrible, demonic thing, i rarely if ever dated (and incidentally, it flared up more!).
frankly, one chronic, poorly-understood medical condition is plenty; i didn't need the eczema on top of the repetitive strain injury problems i already have.
the herb works very well for my wife ( i think she is more or less cured) but we have not yet dared give it to my son (because of his age ).
i understand my mom always has another cause for my son's eczema and if he has skin out for people to see they think i let him get a sunburn, i want to say, mind your own business we are doing the best we can.
i hope it's the right move for  jodi.
we've also been doing the chiropractor for 3 weeks now (twice a week) with great success.
anybody got any ideas on how i can teach my husband to do that???

whether or not you took the cyclosporine for the eczema, could you let us know whether you think it "did the trick" for your skin, and also whether you had other bad side effects from it.
it's fragrance free and has a nice greasy feel.
anyway, it is  true what you said that you can never tell how bad it is going to be.

i know things will get easier when juliet has passed her terrible two and jodi's immune system gets stronger.
all i know is jodi likes cool and well ventilated places like our  home.
i am already on an extensive vitamin/mineral program, but wondered if  anyone had strong feelings about or experience with the glandulars.
but i often feel we will find one day that eczema is just the skin's way of reacting to a number of things the body doesn't like and has no consistent cause.
even the rest of her skin is becoming "baby soft" everywhere!

all were bought at a chemist or pharmacy.
i've used aloe vera topically and have found its soothing & healing properties to be helpful.
eliminated all known allergens, and also several that the dermatologist  suggested we stay away from "just in case".
no really big deal, as meat is ok.
thru some kind of test?
i use about half the suggested amount.
he read me the riot act about all the antibiotics from last year, but what  is a mom to do you work with what you have till you find something better.
hi susan, i am also new to the list and felt very moved by your post.
next i am trying debbie's suggestion of a chiropractor.
from: debi subject: to: e baby moms i feel overwhelmed, there are quite a few of us who have babies with severe  e. debbie, rita, jolie, karen and more.

we saw two different  ones, and stopped after he became very scared of the second one (her  adjustments hurt him).

but i'm giving it more time before i buy a large size.
so, it turns out that diprobase, cost gbp 12.50 for 500g contains exactly the same ingredients (possibly in different proportions, admittedly) as aqueous cream, cost gbp 2.50 for 500g.

the doctor just wanted to put me on stronger steroids.
after 10 days, i tried to wean off and had a return flare as bad as the first.
i don't give her the drop very often since her appetite is mostly good.
my son reacts strongly to smoke filled rooms and antique stores, this is in addition to his food intollerances.
and the omission of oils from these lotions may help explain their  effectiveness in my case.
i read one research paper that recommended 500 mg 3x per day for eczema, psoriasis, herpes, shingles and got very good results.

it has to be quick&easy, so that i can bake a bunch and freeze them in for use instead of bread.
actually what i've used instead with similar results is: take a piece of cheesecloth, put oatmeal (i used organic when i could) in it and tie it up tight.
i  guess i should be smart enough to test new products in one spot before putting  it all over

even the cold water/damp sheet didn't work, and it usually does.
it feels soothing though and helps with the itch, especially on my face.
my doctor put me on prednisone which almost entirely cleared my skin within 2 days (problem: pred.

i don't know their names in english since they are indigenous in china.
it is not the most pleasant thing in the world, especially if you date fairly  regularly.
now melt that over some corn flakes -- i think i could well live on that for a month...
the little bit of itchy, flaky eczema that i had left was cleared up using the shampoo.
tell me about the homeopath you go to.
unfortunately, for some reason it never occurred to me that my daughter could  be allergic to soy, so i never eliminated that, which has turned out to be the  major culprit in her case.
and more than you would  think do know, and react quite sympathetically.
what have your doctors attributed all the allergies to?
and now her sister wants the same attention.
i used to  take at least one oatmeal bath a day and it was the only time i felt  comfortable in my skin.
so who are  they to make these types of judgements of other professionals?
i still struggle with that one, because right after isaac  was born, we took him to a naturopath who told me i should immediately take all  dairy, corn, wheat, and peanuts from my diet, as long asi was nursing him.
the aveeno anti itch cream with calamine worked somewhat but the aveeno lotion caused her skin to get worse...
the liter  bottle (green front) is sold at approx usd 16.- in the pharmacy.
as i told  him once, "you're easier to ignore than the itch is... "
now daniel is allergic to peanuts, but not  dairy.
fingers crossed, but i'm "in remission" at the moment.
anybody use just sesame oil or anything like that.
i just remember feeling so alone...
fortunately, i was self indulgent that day and bought them anyway (about $50 a  sheet).
in fact, i usually add a bit more glycerin to it.
this seemed to help him, but it takes a lot of attention.
these were the only things she could tolerate.
since the 2nd visit she's been eating better again.
by the time i've been in for a week, my legs look almost normal.
we also think that his eczema got triggered by a series of antibiotics that he was on to fight ear infections that began at about 5 months.

recently, when i ran out of hydrocortizone cream i put this on my face and it acted much more effectively there than the cream--practically the "magic bullet" for my facial eczema.
if needed, however, corneal transplantation for keratoconus carries about a 90%-ish success rate - it is one of the diseases that we do pretty well with when performing transplants.
but at any rate i'm real hopeful now.
and good luck to all who try this.
our building is 5 years old.
sometimes we even had to carry her because her skin was so bad that if she walked, scabs would break open and she'd bleed.
everyone used to try & make me feel better by saying that i was the only one who noticed it and now i realize that it's not necessarily true.
i notice that when i wash jodi's hair everyday, her e clears up on her scalp.
i'm thinking about getting someone to do a comprehensive air testing in  our new home.
my daughter (age 2-1/2) has eczema and complete strangers are always asking  questions about it, so i can empthasize with your self-consciousness.
and you have been dealing with them as a  teen.
i tried it on a few items; many of the  "official" ones (eucerin, lac-hydrin, aveeno, eurax etc.) are there,  but the "alternative" health-food store ones (simicort, herpacine)  are not.
but since she hates lying on her belly or being in the crawling position, there are times she can't find anything to support herself to move around.
it's a glutinous rice cake that you can bake in the oven; makes a hearty, sticky bun with a crust.
and even if he doesn't--we will keep looking for underlying causes.
for images of severe cases see: http://www.panix.com/~donwiss/index.shtml#dh then there is is peter thompson's web page at http://www.demon.co.uk:80/webguides/nutrition/diets/gluten-free/ with an article written by dr. joseph murray (university of iowa medical school).
the first suggested vitamins he will not chew.
i do manage to keep it under control (it's always worse  during winter and during certain times of the month), but i *can't stand* the  looks of consternation on my relatives' faces when they see it.
it was $45 for the first visit and $35  for the rest.
i use lubriderm as a moisturizer (my doctor's suggestion) and clotriminazole 1% (i got that tip here).
and when we'd stop giving it to him, about two weeks later, he'd start to get worse.
when you get overwhelmed, post another message like you did, that's what  we're here for.
rashes usually hide things like scars so when i notice one, i'm happy because it means my skin is doing well!
she's doing great: clearing completely on some days.
i still have problems with all of those things, though especially to eggs, and any nuts.
what ever dress or medication you choose, i think it is wise to have one stock phrase for those who comment on your skin.
try to set up the situation so that you have lots of little reminders that you're happy to be taking this step.
feelings of anger, guilt, and frustration at my parents still cloud my thinking now, esp.
never had any thrush or  any sign of candida, no ear infection or use of antibiotic .
i now have eczema the worst i have ever been in my life.
sue - though the viral attack started a month ago, jodi still has a few  scattered blister-like rashes broke out on her skin here and there.
the problem is that you must take  it the way it says, or it will cease to have an effect.
the rest of his body is totally free of eczema now (big hooray with lac-hydrin 5), but his scalp is a mess of dandruff.
i'm pissed that my doctor actually caused part of the problem.
so, she had 9 clearing days (with only 2  actual days of "looking" clear since she started out as mess), then  went downhill for 3 days (but not too bad at all really) and now has been going  back uphill for the last 3 days.
we prefer this to scratching, but we occasionally try to break this one up, too, just to make sure he isn't "going away" to deal with his problem by himself.
the pharmacist suggested switching  to a hydrocorozone mix with a cetaphil base.
i can't vouch for the relevance or accuracy of what follows, knowing nothing about dermatitis herpetiformis myself, but i'm hoping someone on the list will be able to comment on how this might relate (or not relate, i guess) to our shared problem.
i've tried dhs zinc pyrithione shampoo, nizorol shampoo, tar shampoos & derma smooth (which is an oil based cortisone solution which, in the past, has helped the eczema on my skin).
the sun is shining and i'm going out to take  a walk.
we still might have to do ear tubes at  some point, but his ears are no worse than they were when he was on the  antibiotics.
they include the mcdougall program, and the mcdougall program for maximum weight loss, and at least 2 books of recipe collections.
we have to become educated consumers and unfortunately waste time investigating these ingredients to see if there are actually cheaper sources for the same stuff.
faith, i couldn't agree with you more, i am of the same mind.

she agreed, and the whole process was much more low- key than i expected (no attempts on her part to find the "cause" of my e., etc.).
our baby is 100% breastfed, and we are really (that is my wife... ) working on her diet.
the blood test in  my opinion means nothing, even my gi never performed these tests on mac.

i can't imagine  having it all over my body.
just a note to heather: my niece go married two years ago.
from what i understand, leaky gut is an increase in intestinal permeability which results in toxins, antigens etc.
a thorough cleansing should help the itching quite a bit.
they do not get dirt out of my husband's clothes (construction worker).
but it is a big time in a person's life
debbi went  one step further than i by using a chiropractor.
along with this, i treat the condition further with schering's elocon  ointment (0.1%) (a steroid cream; not regularly), and vaseline intensive care  lotion: sensitive dry skin w/ oatmeal.
jodi has had no blows to her head or trauma to her spine; couldn't think of anything that could cause any neurotoxin or any malnutrition.

those of us who've had eczema all our lives remember the hope that we would grow out of it, and i hate to be a spoil sport and say "don't get your hopes too high" because i remember how that hope kept me alive for 14 years.
my mother used to tell me that some mark on my groin area was from the herpes infection, but now it is indistinguishable from other souvenirs.
so i resorted to benadryl for a few nights as a crutch to help break the cycle.
the body can eventually heal itself if it can get out of the cycle long enough to "catch up".
one thing i am definitely grateful for is my supportive fiance.
the reason it's still used is that it's absolutely necessary to produce a  certain type of emulsion; it's not just something that's added, it's something  you need when you want to produce a so-called "vanishing cream".
healing psoriasis: the natural  alternative i am thinking of purchasing the book.
i encourage you to select the wedding gown that you'd feel most comfortable with and not worry about what friends and relatives think.

desowen lotion we use desonide cream on our 16 mo old son every now and then.
a neigbor told us about bag balm, it turns out to have sulpha in it and caused our daughter to break out head to toe in hives... we were very scared and finally went to a pediatrician and were immediately given the full regimen- prednisolone, oral antibiotic and baby benadryl.
what's next sue writes something that struck a nerve with me.
here's some of the basic information you need to know: they will teach you how to give yourself a daily injection of gamma interferon, which they said is a synthetic version of what is normally produced by the body.
either way, it dried my (very oily) skin and that's the last thing  eczema-people need.
i'm sorry to hear about daniel -- people haven't asked about brian's face or problem, however, he doesn't go out much right now since it's so cold.
personally, i think i'll like the "hugs" method.
bread is out; cheese is out; yoghurt is out; eggies are out-- so here's my question: does anyone have a quick&simple recipe for corn-based pancakes (no eggs, no milk, no wheat)?
i really only have eczema on my hands, mostly, and i prefer b-v to the ultravate.
i might also suggest that "sun bathing" be used as well.
there must be something i can do to help.
i would like to find an anti-itch cream that is not totally nasty.
if i hear from the lady, i'll relay.
the question i have is how do we find someone who *can* help us work toward the cause??

sue also mentioned something that she had done with isaac (and i note many of the other parents on here are doing), where she breaks him away from scratching, but in a loving, helpful way.
my body doesn't seem to produce much oil so i give it some with the alpha keri (getting a soft water service helped too!!).
haven't even needed the hot water trick for itching in the past week or so.
she had a disastrous itching fit in the car yesterday.
red wine i have the same reaction as diane...
recently, however, she has had a relapse of major proportions.
we are using a spray on her scalp, na-pca non oily with aloe vera, from the local coop made by twin lab in ny.
now she's having  one or two (better) bowel movements a day instead of one every two days.
by word of mouth we have heard of things that have worked for some people... be forwarned...
the last time i had a flare up was 2 weeks before i gave birth to juliet, my older one.
after years in a zen training center and a major diet change,  my sister now has good control over her skin, and she is very articulate about  the emotional hurts that her scratching helped keep at bay.

it can be a little tricky to fit a keratoconus patient with contact lenses, but it is almost always possible.
i resort to this book when i haven't got the time to think about cooking.
searching for things (easy-to-digest foods, supplements, minerals, vitamins, homeopathic remedies...
i agree that habit and self control have little to do with scratching.
trust me, i know this  from experience.
my wife is pretty much a vegetarian, i have the family history of fair and tender skin.
i tried them anyway, and i have had great success.
i believe  (though i may be wrong) that regular bathing would remove some of the bacteria  that causes the itching.
two  things i did differently at the end of the good cycle were: let her eat a few  things she hasn't had all month and visited a house with a dog again (last 2  itching fits were while visiting a "dog" household and patting their  dog.).
he hadn't really expected that.
from: royce subject: polypropylene glycol oops...
i dumped a friend largely because she was so goopy  feel-sorry-for-me it made me sick.
great expression: feeling comfortable in one's skin.
if they are left alone (although they itch horribly) they will fade and disappear within 30 minutes or so.
we've taken julia to 3 chiropractor appts.
rice flour makes good muffins (though rugged), and you can use soy flour in place of eggs in baked goods; just use 1 heaping tbsp.
and  sure enough we had just had a horrible night's sleep, which was the beginning  of a bad 3-day cycle.
one of my older sisters was just talking to me about how she remembered helping to care for my eczema and how that made her feel special and at the same time close to me.

i also use theraplex emollient and clear lotion as moisturizers and sometimes vitamin e oil.
chiropractor says to expect a couple more quick bouts before healing.
she started breaking out bad (as acne, etc.)

not like her sister, who cried out for help when she was in the same situation at the same age.
it looked awful and i was in tears big time!
then last month he fell off even that curve, and our doctors were  concerned that we have more than eczema to worry about.
i know that they love me and want to see me well, but i don't want them to bring it up.
my son's eczema started after alot of antibiotics and we do have  ear tubes, i think they were harder on us than him.
her solid food only  include pear, apple, rice, carrot, yam, very lean pork, chinese leafy green and  rice cereal.
but i have to be careful not to burn.
names most of you are probably familiar with.
they tend to pop out on me when i get excited.
but it was as expected: topical  prescription cortisone, bactroban (antiobiotic ointment), and a prescription  antihitamine (atarax).
sometimes this condition makes me feel so alone in the world and it is nice to know that there are others that can empathize.
now it doesn't touch my eczema
this book talks about the misalignment of the spine causing psoriasis and  eczema problems.

the timing was interesting because we had talked to an old-time pharmacist who swore by tar shampoo for cradle cap for his children (now grown) but said he couldn't remember the last time he had some in the store.
there are just all these theories.
in addition to the germ killing affect of the sun and the affect the ocean water's contents must have on the skin, i theorize that the skin is purged by the profuse perspiration that occurs when we go in the sun.
hopefully, jodi's e will get better.
, it's a little expensive for me though so i cut it with mineral oil.
hope i didn't  mislead anyone.
these sheets sound  like they're worth a try.
sure enough, polypropylene glycol is in there!
actually what i've used instead with similar results is: take a piece  of cheesecloth, put oatmeal (i used organic when i could) in it and tie it up  tight.
the name on the bottle says  therapeutic atrac-tain with 5% urea.
i nursed him for just over 5 months and our doctors all said he probably didn't have food allergies.

i was hoping for tests,  actually.
in the last few weeks, his skin has been  blotchy, but the blotches are not usually raised--they're splashes of color.
(while she was also starting to  flare again too)...
my dermatologist doesn't think that my e. is allergy-related,
my parents called me a  "vampire."
(for my son who is  two) said childhood is the problem.
various moisturizers, creams, chemicals, vitamins etc. were okay
date: 24 feb 1997 11:26:00 from: ann subject: sarna/central heating someone mentioned something called sarna as an anti-itch lotion that gives the skin a "cooling sensation."
it smells  like the parking lot at six flags on a sunny day (creosote) and i wonder if it  will be too harsh.
with leaky gut, it is said that constant bombardment of allergens can cause the leaky gut or the porous walls may "cause" the allergies.
i have long believed that any lubricant that produces a cooling sensation is actually drying the skin (the cool you feel is the water leaving the skin).
and i wasn't sure that the cyclosporine wasn't causing them.
i am super sensitive about  my eczema and when it's bad i feel disgusting.
daniel's head is real flaky and itchy and scabby from scratching.
i think i'll take your suggestion and stop putting socks over brian's hands at night.

even when i was a child, my parents built a new home and i completely cleared up.
that feeling of just not knowing how to put all the clues together to figure it out is so frustrating.
i really can't wait to get allergy tests done on him -- as a matter of fact, i think i'll call the allergist today to schedule an appt.
in the beginning, when you haven't had it very long over your entire body, the visual appearance gets so much attention.

you are the one spending the  money, if she indicates she has a problem with your skin condition, you  indicate that you have enough of a problem with her attitude to consider taking  your business elsewhere...
the stuff is great though.
dr. sheehan won't take anyone younger than 1.
i found it long ago, but lost it, and can't find it.
4 cups grain flakes, usually oats 2 cups oat bran 1 cup ground flax seeds 1 cup ground milk thistle seeds mix, store in the fridge, and  let soak in hot water for half an hour before eating.
i am miserable  in my own skin with it head to toe.
after pushing her, she said that the essential fatty acids that she worries most about are not actually gamma-linolenic (in epo), but the ones in fish oils--the omega-3 essential fatty acids.
i also ate alot of peanut butter, nuts and dairy because i don't like much meat.
the guy had a terrible "bedside manner," and i was so pissed off at his seeming disregard for what *i* needed that i didn't follow his advice.
bless you all... hope some of what i've shared is helpful in some little way.
it  took the doctors a year to figure out that i was very allergic to dairy--so  allergic, that i was reacting to the dairy coming trhough my mom's breastmilk.
does it hurt, itch, look red or can it be seen or felt at all?
this  is supposed to be better for them--to have food pass thru more quickly.
he will  lay there as long as i want to rub.
when i put that on, i can almost hear my skin gulping it down.

as for the other routine stuff, i also use tide free, double rinse... hot water bedding... no antibiotics (she either had a bad reaction to keflex at 7 mos.
i've found it near the cortisone creams and calamine lotion in the pharmacy, but it doesn't have any steroids or other drugs in it.
i'm thinking about getting someone to do a comprehensive air testing in our new home.
i can't afford to use it all the time, though.
if your eczema shows on the big day, you pin the  wrap on with a brooch, if not, you just nonchalantly put it on and take it off  as you wish.
yes, i know  that my scratching is making things worse.
after 50 years of life and skin trouble, i have many permanent marks.
there would't be any allergies, not many kids really have  allergies.
date: 21 feb 1997 13:38:40 from: tina subject: stop scratching
hello someone posted names of some anti-dust spray products.
so i would recommend being up front with someone like a dressmaker  or sales clerk -- their job is to help you find a dress to let the inner beauty  shine through, and i expect they will all have good suggestions for your outer  looks as well if you let them know what you're up against.
unfortunately, for some reason it never occurred to me that my daughter could be allergic to soy, so i never eliminated that, which has turned out to be the major culprit in her case.
i used to take at least one oatmeal bath a day and it was the only time i felt comfortable in my skin.
some have 320 threads per inch.
i was convinced that there was a connection at the time but can't be sure.
apparently, the causal  relationship between the two (spine & stomach) can go either way: stomach  damage can short circuit the spine or a misalignment can mess up the stomach.
but here we go (these are all taken twice a day): along with this, i treat the condition further with schering's elocon ointment (0.1%) (a steroid cream; not regularly), and vaseline intensive care lotion: sensitive dry skin w/ oatmeal.
my 28 months is getting quite jealous lately.

tina, it sounds like you handled the situation well with the girl at preschool.
i don't mean to sound like "woe is me" i know things can be worse  than this
who knows exactly what is helping the most.
i find that having the freedom to do whatever i need to do from using my teeth, a plastic pen top, etc works the best for me.
our allergist gave us a long list of medications (antihistamines and others) that our daughter was not to use for at least one week prior to testing, as use of certain meds can alter test results.
when i read through past archives, i could relate to those of you talking about scratching for hours in bed at night.

then a viral attack caused huge blisters over her lips and eczematic right cheek.
i found this message on sci.med.nutrition.
i'll try it again though, as i'd also eaten more cheese than i should this last week.
the author does not speak at all about children or infants so i just use common sense, ask health food store prof.
i removed almost everything from her diet except rice, pears,  apples, sweet potatoes, squash.
as sue described her son isaac, who scratches when he is frustrated, i realized that i too learned this habit in infancy and never got over it.
she says that she doesn't even notice.
i would recommend that you bathe him very often in warm water (hot water will irritate the skin usually, and cold is unbearable) during the summer, as the dirt irritates the skin, causing itching.
there's a tremendous lack of eczema information out there, i guess.
sometimes i guess breastfeeding isn't always the best for baby!
everyday, i brewed a big bag of herbal mix with 48 oz of water and reduced it into 6 oz of decoction.
everytime i went to go shopping for a dress my skin would decide to flare up and become a lovely shade of sunburnt looking red (really bright against those white dresses).
i can go on and on and on...
oddly enough  he has no problem with milk and that is usually a big one.
so we had a wheat-related day, a quinoa day, an amaranth day, and a day of no grains.
like i said, i don't use them but every couple of weeks and i was told never to put it on his face.
are there daily vitamins you also take?
i am sure many of you with eczema know the frustration of trying to sleep when everything you touch seems painful or makes you itch.
try to set up the situation so  that you have lots of little reminders that you're happy to be taking this  step.
signs they looked for were: eczema (alraedy obvious); ear cracks (where his ear lobe meets his head--a pretty constant crack there); creased eyelids (instead of just one fold in his eyelid, there were always a couple, both top and bottom);
you don't have to put up with people's crap.
my mother always told me how heartbreaking it was for her that i had eczema  and not to itch it!...
however, i'm going to start bathing her often and see if that helps too.
my skin drinks it quickly and so far has no reaction to it, either immediately or over time.
i spoke to dr.  siebenlist at 415-476-4701 in san francisco.

again, this is only my way of treating the problem, and it differs from  person to person; depending on allergies, etc.
my only concern now is that the anti-fungal  properties of clotriminazole will lessen due to extended usage and i may have  to start using steroids again.
date: 19 feb 1997 13:03:21 from: tina subject: hello again thank you chris, for writing to me.
anyway, after 40 years i have learned how to recognize when i can say my skin is "good" and it is good right now, but as i'm sure you know, "good" is relative for us.
also said that they just found out that head & shoulders is just as effective as the nizorol shampoo that he prescribed for me the last time i was there... interesting.
like you said though, it is hard to keep track of it all.

add on your successful foods, by the end of  the week we can print one list and start testing new foods for our little ones.
baby is baby, the only way you can help is try (very hard) to divert his/her attention from scratching during the day and wear one-piece "body suit" and use looong gloves (we use adult socks ) at night.
i like the alpha keri (i look for the generic brands of it) because it penetrates my tough skin and makes it soft.

i'd  thought that interrupting him would just make him more frustrated, or angry (he  sure reacted that way!).

debbi went one step further than i by using a chiropractor.
all doctors should know this and should only prescribe creams (or lotions or gels) for allergic people when the greasiness of ointments can not be tolerated.

e. i  also stopped drinking milk myself when i resumed breast feeding.
i'm in the middle of a bad outbreak, my antihistamines have mysteriously stopped working (second type that this has happened with), and i need a good night's sleep.
though i am sure it is different for different people; i suppose i am very lucky.
by the way, i am the leaky gut person, my gastroenterologist diagnosed his  as a birth defect.
he scratched alot harder back then and i felt like putting socks on his hands just gave him rug burn.
when i went to the holistic doctors they said that i had a high level of candida yeast in my system and thought this might be causing the eczema to flare.
i think patsy's given me the one angle that's going to help me help him  understand, though!
when he scratches now, instead of that red and abraded skin, he gets big patches of welts--dozens of small, white bumps, amost contiguous to each other.
one thing that i noticed throughout the years, that makes e/allergies even more annoying, is that my allergies to things change from time to time.
i just used it because the pharmacist said it was good stuff for eczema.
i have noticed that  since i have quit taking the nature's biotics caplet, my eczema has gotten  worse, so i know that that one is helpful.
there have been many times in the past when i couldn't stop scratching.
but there are a lot of ingredients in it (i think one of  which is not the greatest for my skin)
do any of the children out there use their teeth to scratch themselves?
this was suggested by our doctor, and is hard for me to do because i grew up  being constantly cold (for economic reasons) and have a big emotional reaction  to cold.

right now (and for last 3 weeks) she's doing great: clearing completely on some days.
well, now that you mention it, yes, at one time i *did* use my teeth to scratch myself, and did so quite regularly up until about a year ago (when i started trying to take care of the stuff... by simply not scratching even though it about drove me out of my mind, as well as experiments with vitamin supplements.

the holistic doctor said that taking enough of it (he recommended 4000mg per day) would build up the walls of the stomach so the toxins wouldn't leak out.
the only time i double rinse is when i accidentally add too much detergent.
around that time, i ran into a product that involved a conbination of multivitamin, cheleated minerals, a variety of antioxidants and proanthocyanidins (in the class of bioflavanols.
these sessions seem to really help him.
very little beef or tuna (suspicious foods for us).
well, in the good old days, ointments did have fewer ingredients than creams.
and whether you put the emphasis on the word you or that also varies the spin.
i've tried various herbs but what i found is that i seem to be allergic or sensitive to many of them probably because i am allergic to plants and flowers.

sue: thanks for sharing so much about isaac.
there are still mild patchy outbreaks from time to time, but it's not nearly as bad as it was.
so, when i use the product i'm taking care of two things in one application.
it's good that you've recognized the problem.
i've  been asked all of my life about mine, and it hurts sometimes (because it is so  embarassing), but i've learned to deal with it (as you obviously have).
in fact i have not had  any e. since, anywhere, except a small 1-inch patch of dry skin on my upper arm  that does not grow or itch!
it's not weeping; it just looks like  patchy, dry red spots.
so i haven't breastfed him since last friday evening.
it is usually found with the babycare products as it is used for napkin/nappy/diaper rash.
that i'm not yet sure about: my 12 month old, julia, was exactly like this (very bloody and oozy all over face) from 7 mos.
i had eczema as a child but quickly and luckily outgrew it very early on.
tell them to stop it, that they don't have a clue.
headaches, drowsiness and dizziness are rarer, as are palpitations and fainting.
so, i stopped it, and will do it at just  bedtime for a bit longer---just in case it's helping at all.
anybody got any ideas on how i can  teach my husband to do that???

therefore, he gave me an alcohol based steroid for the scalp (i think it was called textacort).
i just laughed and told her i'd stop as quickly as  possible (within a week).
she has some good insights, and experiences i resonated with.
but as we all know everyone is different.
but i had fun trying it out.
delivery was very very smooth,  less than 10 minutes.
i mentioned that i had been using topical steroids on my hands and arms and occasionally around my eyes, but that i had stopped when i read about "alleged" effects these had on eyes based on something i read on this list.
there would't be any allergies, not many kids really have allergies.
do whatever you can do to keep your focus off your skin so that whatever its condition, it won't take centerstage.
i haven't been using the shampoo long enough to see how it works.
needless to say, i didn't get much sleep last night because after i went back to bed, i was just too upset!
it was difficult to stop so suddenly, although i was down to feeding him only 2 or 3 times a day since i work full-time.
anyway don't worry about the having to be  different yet.
it won't stop the viral attack and it destroys good flora.

i'm trying to use different lotions, creams, cortisones, in the morning and night.
my theory about my body is that after 20 years of using topical steroids, and 6 weeks of using oral ones last summer (to combat the flare i caused by quitting the topicals cold turkey), my liver wanted to speak its mind and did so through my skin.
i think it was linda who talked about the guilt feelings of passing her  eczema on to her kid.
it seems to protect it and it keeps me from scratching.
itchy babies and struggling moms i have been reading alot about nursing and eczema and allergies on this list.
after just  spending 3 months with an unsuccessful one, though, i wasn't feeling as  confident as she was.
it's manufactured by bayer, germany and free of polypropylene glycol.
i don't know if what we did helped, but here's what it was.
the ones i tried are: sulphur, sepia, graphites, apis mellipica & thyrodium (the most effective for me).
we started feeding him corn this  week, and his back and stomach are broke out again with e. wonder if he's  allergic to it?
true there was a history  of atopy.
when we first took him to the allergist his skin was so bad they couldn't test him there.
but i have to "let it out" somehow.
she slept much better and had very good appetite.
old until about 11 mos.
my mother and i have gone back over my  highs and lows with it and the relationship to the homes that we lived in.
i've been told that anyone with eczema/psoriasis ("leaky gut") should avoid the nightshades (tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, peppers of all kind, and paprika) and to avoid foods high in fat (counting whole milk dairy products).
by the way, i am the leaky gut person, my gastroenterologist diagnosed his as a birth defect.
mac has not been well lately, he had a fever  siezure on sunday.
and like i've explained, i've been doing the  chiropractor work, and dietary changes...
also, does time of year seem to have any effect on the disease?
she's never had a clear day since she got eczema at 2 wks.
her diagnosis is toxins in the blood.
they also did a blood test to test  my thyroid.
no systemic antibiotic or steroid was needed, else, it would have contradicted her herbal treatment.
my 3 and 1/2 year old understood what it was about.
i did have the chance to whisk her off to a portrait studio on her best day--so i had some luck there.
i take kelp everyday, it seems to help
this also happens after outdoor exercise in the summer (in the sun) i haven't been on a beach vacation for several years, but when i was a kid, swimming in the ocean every day would clear up my hands every time, so i think the ocean has a lot to do with it.

this is just  as effective as the steroid.
her solid food only include pear, apple, rice, carrot, yam, very lean pork, chinese leafy green and rice cereal.
also do you know if gamma interferon is safer than steroids?date: 5 feb 1997 13:21:38 from: kim subject:
my  husband actually has more of an understanding than i do since he has e. he

( she has been suffering from e since she was 3 weeks old and will be 11 months in a week.)
when you itch, you scratch.
they  just need instruction.
but i get anxious and i want to try to make my skin better right away.
i ordered the video "alexander, the elephant who can't eat peanuts".
it makes me  wonder why they don't test things on each patient (especially people with such  sensitive skin) before just prescribing things at random.
so, i backed up to the pure basics again (gerber applesauce, pears, rice cereal, squash, sweet potato..).
just tell your baby that you will find a way for her to  be normal...
that was when i threw the  towel in and took him to my homeopathic md.
i think the leaky guy syndrome is one example of a cause--if substances are leaking into the wrong body cavities and causing problems, then the body will manifest this problem with eczema, maybe.
is anyone allergic to glycerin?
but it was as expected: topical prescription cortisone, bactroban (antiobiotic ointment), and a prescription antihitamine (atarax).
around that time, i ran  into a product that involved a conbination of multivitamin, cheleated minerals,  a variety of antioxidants and proanthocyanidins (in the class of bioflavanols.
primrose oil topically only and flax seed oil orally.
perhaps the 3rd week we can discuss homeopathy or  alternatives.
in the last few weeks, his skin has been blotchy, but the blotches are not usually raised--they're splashes of color.
he  started sucking his thumb and twirling his hair--a trick he still uses when he  is frustrated or overwhelmed.
these do not then get red and angry--they just disappear.
i have been told that prick test doesn't alway tell the whole story till a child is atleast 5 years.
i'm not doing a green leafy thing so i don't know anything about it.
they predict it based on family histories of allergies.
ann: i know nothing about the ucsf gamma interferon study but your question makes me curious about it.
rita, you are probably correct to suspect that the central heating in your building brings in dust and mold.
our allergist only had us keep daniel off of his antihistimines for 2 days before the tests.
i'm quiet on  this list now as thankfully, my problems have subsided for the time being.
again, i found the first (longs proprietary formula) to be astoundingly effective on my eczema, i.e., it's vanished since i started using the stuff.
i've tried it twice, but i must say, the second time i had a very itchy night.
because it  aggravated my irritable bowel syndrome.
now my philosophy (this week, anyway) is to use drugs for an emergency but to still continue all prevention measures and keep pursuing original cause(s).

maybe i'll get some of that to make ocean water to soak my hands in.
it is a great guide to figure out your child allergies without the aid of high  technology expensive dr. visits.
i add all kinds of dried  fruit and nuts for variety.
regarding the antibiotic cause/trigger: i've read that antibiotics are rough on the stomach, particularly in an allergic person.
he  talks about pizza or hotdogs but never offers to have a fit over not having  them.
i mentioned a week or two ago  that i was going to push my dermatologist in this direction, and i have had a  start down that road.

no doctor,  pharmacist or other expert has been able to give me a definite answer.
my dermatologist doesn't think that my e. is allergy-related, but i do know that textile manufacturers treat fabrics with a number of chemicals, including formaldehyde, which probably don't do much for us e. sufferers!
for a while, say at age 11 or 12 mos, this actually  worked to help him stop.
so he drinks rice milk (on his rice day, which is every  other day now), fortified with calcium.
during the whole time when she was taking the decoction, no emollient was allowed.
we have used evening primrose oil topically only and flax seed oil orally.

we found wearing body suite helps a lot at night - it reduces the degree of damage from unintentional scratching and help to make sure he won't get cold (my baby will scratch everywhere - pull up his coat and scratch his stomach - during sleep.
i am not on the edge of constant irritation and feel that i have had my sense of humour return!
once we have the allergy testing done, i think/hope it will be very helpful in controlling his eczema (especially on his face).
i checked the price and  asked the clerk when they would be on sale.
i  am sure many of you with eczema know the frustration of trying to sleep when  everything you touch seems painful or makes you itch.
my dermatologist put me on prednisone last month because the eczema was so severe.
we usually gave him 4-5 tsp/ per day, and  think that this really helped him.
i also just bought tea tree oil soap to see if i can benefit from the antibacterial effects of that too.

i hope it is comforting to know that we are all out here with some of the same problems---it sure is for me.

it's so frustrating trying to find a cause and treatment for this horrible condition.
i think some of us with eczema live somewhat parallel lives.
especially at the end it has children with allergies being interviewed.
not on a baby (my  opinion).
i think that the same thing happened to isaac--i was drinking lots of milk, and
when her body temperature rises, her skin acts up and rashes develop quickly, especially on her cheeks.

as wendy suggested, consider prednisone as this is a very special day.
my  eczema is the worst there right now.
that was when i threw the towel in and took him to my homeopathic md.
this is just as effective as the steroid.
was isaac real bad when he first came in, etc.?
and i am praying that my skin is clear for the big day.
at first we didn't have much ammunition--we just tried to talk them out of prescribing antibiotics--but eventually we started seeing specialists, and got better information...
.. it will be interesting to find out what exactly he's allergic to.
then the next 3 days were a gradual downhill.
he took a tongue depressor and touched the back of my throat with it
thanks for your point of view re: touching, physical contact.
i expect he would not  only not find it likely to help him, but he'd find it debilitating.
he yells,  cries, kicks, and struggles, but we calmly hold him, encourage him to keep  going in his crying and kicking, and assure him that he's doing the right  thing, we love him, and we'll help him through this.
i am in the process of researching antibacterial lotions and soaps and am finding the same phenomenon of very similar ingredients with a wide range of prices.
it would almost  appear to me that i mark significant improvements on a weekly basis...  especially this last 3 weeks.
i still cannot tell if the pruritus comes  first or the rash comes first.

she looked happy and comfortable from within.
so i don't think the drying effect is real important for me) but it might help you to get away from the oily meds.
the clear lotion is a mineral and jojoba type oil (with petroleum fraction & something else - sorry i don't have the bottle here) which i am surprised i can tolerate because many people claim mineral oil is no good.
he explained that the misalignment probably did happen at birth--after all, she was 10 lbs.
the homeopathic md suggested vitamin therapy for mac, first and foremost the colloidal minerals.
can one be equally allergic to their ingredients as to dust?
although the quality of some might be better than others, i think they are probably all going to be of the same general philosophy.
adult dosage costs about 68 pounds sterling for a week's prescription.
unfortunately, it wears off after 3 weeks.
debbie (and julia), i haven't really given brian many baby foods yet.

just hours after my milk diet began, she again displayed serious skin disruptions.
he never gave me any problems going back and forth from breast and bottle.
debbie, thanks for the reply, he was a little worse this a.m. with lots of itching in the night, even spots that don't look bad, the back of his knees always itch at night.
are you eliminating soy, malt and rice as well?
the different houses that i have lived in have been the pattern.
this product is not seen as much as the standard "all" but i am sure if you ask your store manager to order it he/she would, as it sells easily.
again, it's only available by prescription through the emergency drug release program.

after sending my posting about ointments vs. creams, i got that uncertain feeling and went to check my elocon tube.

i only hope that isaac's viral  infection is not going to get as ugly as jodi's.
i spoke to his doctor's office this morning, and they said to apply neosporin 3 times today, and if it's not much better by tomorrow, bring him in.

i really attribute this to noticing her skin condition on the day she was born, recognizing the similarity and acting on it, in spite of the well-meaning advice of my care-givers.
i really do believe the drugs just suppress the immune system and i want her immune system to find its on way to heal itself, so i don't want to overuse them.
he didn't realize it but that made me even more self-conscious than i already am.
i have never had eczema, but some of my insights that i use to help isaac come from growing up with a younger sister who was very debilitated by it.
he can call it whatever he wants -- that doesn't mean  i have to "just live with it"!
he's the author that speaks about leaky gut... and says along  with it there seems to be a little trouble with elimination (recommends enemas  or high colonics on a fairly regular basis) and talks about specific spinal  misalignments (different ones for psoriasis vs. eczema) and
my dermatologist said to avoid tide.
he is such a blessing -- we thank god for him every day.
we use a cortisone creme lotion when we have to (a couple of times a week).

and scratching is a short-term stimulation, not the deeply fulfilling comfort of tenderness, so scratching just leads to more scratching.
i could never seem clear my eczema 100%.
her face started clearing for 3 days on her own (no cortisone), yet wasn't  sleeping due to "all-over-itchies."
so i am refusing to believe the inevitability of the eczema-athsma progression.
at  first we didn't have much ammunition--we just tried to talk them out of  prescribing antibiotics--but eventually we started seeing specialists, and got  better information...
i guess i should be smart enough to test new products in one spot before putting it all over
i don't think so at penny's or sears.
i've even given her some of the suspect foods (mainly because she begs and screams so i thought i'd try again!).
we get it from our health food store here for about $14 for 4 ounces, which the bottle says is equivalent to 227 500mg softgels of epa (i'm trusting them--haven't done the math).
it seems like the eczema is always worse under my jog bra.

i was just thinking, you can get ocean salt at the pet shop to make salt water for marine fish tanks.
it's like  osteopathy without the force.
so many possible factors: salt water is healing; sun is good too (as in uva treatments); being on vacation usaully means time away from work stress and/or dusty house with pet dander; ocean air is generally pollen free; vacation clothes less irritating than work clothes...

the doctor  just wanted to put me on stronger steroids.
but she said she thought that babies confronted with  such terrible itchiness needed their parents to step in and stop them--they  just weren't strong enough to help themselves.
but just need to get off body odor, they are fine.
i was very self-conscious about it.
i haven't tried this yet but am planning on it.
try not to use systemic antibiotic.
then if that doesn't work i will look  for the nutregena t. about new clothes.

i  want her to look back on her babyhood and not just see eczema in every picture!
donna is right; if people have problems with your eczema, let them deal with it.
and he's so sensitive now... just getting excited during play will bring welts out on his face and legs.
we are trying to distinguish between foods that isaac's skin is sensitive  to, and ones he's actually allergic to.
it is good to know there are other parents out there that have a hard time getting there little ones attention to stop itching.
i  could never seem clear my eczema 100%.
i don't know if i will do it because i'm nervous about giving myself injections, but i'll think about it.

;-) i've noticed that when i'm clothes shopping or fabric shopping,  my hands frequently start acting up (getting hot & itchy; patches of e.  start to redden).
in their opinion, kids retain these symptoms for their whole lives because doctors don't change anything that causes the problems--they just deal with the manifestations--quiet the skin with steroids, open the bronchial tubes with inhalants, etc.

i've been asked all of my life about mine, and it hurts sometimes (because it is so embarassing), but i've learned to deal with it (as you obviously have).
but no problems so far (she had several ear infections until she was two but now can blow her nose and has never has another).

since then all of my eczema has been burning (it feels better today though).

it does directly affect the baby.
i know that backrubs help daniel, too.
the killer is that these things are available for sale widely and that you can't check people haven't got the other drugs it interacts with.
date: 5 feb 1997 15:36:55 from: rita subject: child eczema i'm glad to report that my expedition helped my jodi a whole lot.
regarding the chiro: did your chiropractor describe isaac's condition to  you in a visit-by-visit basis?
since brian's birth, my eczema has calmed  down a lot.
i have my fingers crossed, fully expecting this beast to rear its head again, but at least i have hope now.
let's get organized, lets spend this  week listing foods that work.
i'd recommend it to anyone.
today i'm grateful that my skin is under control.
the first 2 weeks her skin weeped so much i was really worried.
the food is plain, but quite good --
the stress is  high enough without eczema!
he is on a very restricted diet as designated by the e baby foods message.
i have noticed that since i have quit taking the nature's biotics caplet, my eczema has gotten worse, so i know that that one is helpful.
i was also advised not to breast feed my baby for a week to see if breast milk was the culprit.
i figured that those will be  pictures we will look at for the rest of our lives so i wanted to look normal.
she's been going to a  hom eopath for 5 months.
her diagnosis  is toxins in the blood.
triludan fyi, i read in the paper that the fda has announced its intent to ban  terfenadine, which is the active ingredient of triludan (anti-histamine).
gagging i am not sure where that theory comes from but my gag reflex is so strong i cannot even hold a pen in my mouth without gagging!
now put it in your tub.
i don't know he could tell it's leaky  gut or not without specimens.
the more you care  about it, the more others will care about it.
he then tested positive to potatoes and soy,  but his last test came up negative.
btw, does anyone know where i can buy egyptian cotton sheets?
i'm gonna be a mess!).
i also know we could have it alot worse, disease and health wise...
so we began a game where we  would (both) scratch our legs for a second, then throw our hands in the air and  yell "stop!"
the blood test in my opinion means nothing, even my gi never performed these tests on mac.
when you get overwhelmed, post another message like you did, that's what we're here for.
i would put money on a bet that in the next twenty years, they will find that antibiotics and steroids contribute to the progression from eczema to athsma...
jodi was born a full term baby at 8 lbs 2oz.
i'm back to eczema on my legs only.
i've also felt painfully self-conscious in the bridal salons i've been in, worried that the sales assistant was looking at the spots on my arms.
date: 18 feb 1997  15:31:02 from: david subject:
how do you think they worked.
cetaphil/sun we have already stopped using the cetaphil.
i used to think her problem is leaky gut but am not so sure anymore.
what are dhea levels?
when that didn't help much i took her to a derm.
i also keep my heat turned down in the house to the point that others complain,  but heat and sweat drive me batty.
the force of the scratching seems to be the only thing that equals the force of  the frustration.
and had a broken collar bone.
sometimes when he is scratching alot i lay him across my lap and rub his back and down his legs.
you can just toss it out or compost it when your done.
terfenadine may increase the sedative effect of antidepressants, sleeping pills and antipsychotics, whilst antidepressants increase the chance of abnormal heart rhythms.
peanut being bad enough to need to tote the epi-pen!
is it a dermatology department study or what?
they say it can aid in weight loss, anti-aging process and a lot of other things.

i have so many questions.
my herbalist pals tell me milk thistle supports and repairs the liver.
i am  researching the possibility of asbestos being the problem at the house i live  in now.
the ingredients are: water, urea 5%, sorbitol, glyceryl stearate, lactic acid, isopropyl palmitate, octyl palmitate, stearyl alcohol, stearic acid, ceteareth-25, ceteareth-6, peg-40 jojoba oil, quaternium-15, menthylbenzethonium chloride and edta.
i don't know why but with all the vitamins/antihistamines that i take, i'm glad that i don't gag.
i try to remind myself (and husband) of that every day.
i'll let you know if it works.
simply because, from my  experience, only light cleansing is more irritative than none whatsoever.
i am going to try head and shoulders first, since there is some of that in my bathroom already.
date: 27 feb 1997 10:35:29 from: ann subject: misc.
i also remember my mum using olive oil on my scalp eczema when i was younger.
you know how i  scratch in the night?
they're about $10-11 each
something in neosporin can cause allergic reactions.
i've used topical steroid creams regularly since a baby, and i use them fairly regularly now (my eczema is not as bad).
hello again his allergies sound exactly like mine, and i'm 15.
new research has shown it's not as safe as was previously thought.
truth be known i would rather it is the itch, my son is now at the point he can say "i itch" i like having the communication even if it is 2:00 a.m.
then, i was taking cyclosporine for a year and wasn't itchy.
date: 3 feb 1997 13:51:03 from: dave subject: eye problems: keratoconus
in the past she recommended euphrasia when my eyes kept watering for no apparent reason, and that worked really well.
please note, that the vitamin regimen i listed above needs to have vitamin c added to it.
i then had to go have  it removed which was real pleasant.
date: 14 feb  1997 11:18:19 from: jolie subject: julia saw pedi gi--finally!
homeopathic routes can just take an awfully long time sometimes, especially for a baby who can't speak for itself.
pure aloe vera with the vegelatum ointment is working well on her legs.
(her face still looked real good at this point so he wasn't just reading  her.)
in my history i have successfully treated eczema and my repetitive stress injury with one remedy, rhus tox.
date: 18 feb 1997 17:32:03  from: unknown subject: a newcomer my daughter is also allergic to tomatoes she reacts with redness, itching  and hives around her mouth.
it was a method that i stopped using (for some strange reason) a few years ago, and that is why i could not recall anything about it, until my mother told me that i did that at one time.
but i also started a diet change then.
criteria for inclusion in the study: must have eczema for longer than one  year, must have family history of related problems, must have 20% of the body  involved or 10% of face, feet, or genitalia, must have normal kidney, liver,  and blood levels (which they will test), if taking antibiotics must be only  taking one type, if on allergy shots must have been taking them for at least 6  months already, must have no heart disease, no diabetes, no vascular or  rheumatology problems, no hiv, no cancer, no active infections, not pregnant  nor lactating, no central nervous system problems, and never used interferon  before.
linda, you may want to ask your doctor about neosporin.
julia's on bufo (toad poison), a minor one, not many people have heard of it.
then we began an ongoing "fight" with the medical community that we continue to fight.
after investing a million dollars and hours in vitamins, blood tests and every other possible natural cure, i think they are it.
we used to get concerned these food "sensitivities," but we've gotten so used to them that we don't get so concerned about them now.
sweat purges infections i too notice great results when i'm in the sun (esp.
if you don't already have a liquid form of colloidal trace minerals the one i get is by "innovative natural products", brown bottle, 1 oz., 4 oz., and something like 7 oz., called colloidal multiple minerals.

(anticholinergic drigs are used to affect muscle movements and are used to  treat urinary incontinence and ibs.)
i have been tested my times, the most thorough being a blood test.
even when i am constipated my eczema can flare (probably because the toxins are held in the body for too long (also related to leaky gut, i think).
feeding your baby even if your dr asked you to stop for a while.
i have recently tried smiling and saying "eczema" when i get  "that look" -- and to my surprise, i have met so many other people  who have it, who have family members who have it -- i had no idea it was so
but occasionally i've had throat swelling and have needed medical  help.
they seem to make no real difference in the sense that if she's itchy she still wakes up to scratch regardless of being drugged around the clock (which i did for a week).
1.0% hydrocortizone usp, sd alcohol 40.
i now double rinse clothing that touches the affected areas and omit fabric softener on them.
i am throwing it out as i have not seen seafood being mentioned here.
i have never seen another child's skin that looks like daniel's---we are always asked questions about his face in public.

they are raised by just one or two swipes of his scratching, and they last for about ten minutes, then go away.
the aveeno oatmeal bath caused full  body contact dermatitis.
it would almost appear to me that i mark significant improvements on a weekly basis... especially this last 3 weeks.
one of my sisters still had braces on her teeth when she got married, and i  remember how upset she was, moaning about how the photos were going to be  terrible, practicing smiling without showing her teeth, etc.
i  personally suffered very much with my skin problems as a child (my brother had  it too but not as bad).
we have had him tested twice (last about 6 months ago).
regarding evening primrose oil: i took it for 3 yrs for fibromyalgia and  severe pms.
did you try head & shoulder?
so i was wondering how you're  feeling about stopping so abruptly.
i use to work  in retail and would stock shelves and just the chemicals from the cardboard  would make me red and itchy---i don't have e. sue, thanks for the imput on e, allergies and asthma.
but i think it's worth it.
true there was a history of atopy.
my skin seems to get worse if i don't.
could you tell me how they do the allergy testing on a baby -- just curious in case we need to do this.
for example, tomatoes make his face red and itchy  while he eats them, but don't seem to have a secondary reaction through his  skin (ie, his eczema doesn't get worse after having eaten them).
either my husband or i have to stay with her or else she'll start scratching.
although both my midwives and her pediatrician assured me that she just had "heat rash", i knew she was displaying eczema and allergic reactions.
just do the best you can do and keep talking about your fears with your loved  ones.
they are amazed at what he looks like now--no extra eyelid folds,  no ear cracks, a clear face, etc.
i would add my "2 cents" that maybe it is time to try something else... the first perhaps being taking nothing for a while, then if that doesn't get you somewhere, try the immuran.
my chemistry isn't great, but if glycerin is one of those substances that draws water to itself (hydrophilic?) from the air, then it must also drag water out of any other surface it's in contact with, in this case the skin.
then i  started receiving this mailing list.
no cats here, however the dr. did indicated that kids don't always show correct test till they are about 5, i wish it would have worked.
i  have noticed that a good vitamin regimen has almost eliminated the itching (it  got to the point at one time that i wished i had a wire brush to scratch with),  as well as induced healing.
of course i  also had my share of goodies -- chocolate.
royce subject: allergies & e hi.
i know that they love me and want to see me well, but i  don't want them to bring it up.
i am not sure that will show up on the test.
telling me to stop scratching doesn't really help me at all!
the list of pollens, molds, foods, danders, etc. to which she has tested as severely allergic is mind-bending.
in fact i have not had any e. since, anywhere, except a small 1-inch patch of dry skin on my upper arm that does not grow or itch!
that was my first impulse when i read your first post about using head and shoulders.
i'd say that eczema will be the least of your problems once you're married, but then i'm divorced so my outlook might be a shade jaded!date: 10 feb 1997 12:55:45 from: donna subject: eczema & wedding dress: need support!
since you were interested in the "good" foods i figured the "bad" ones might be of interest too: i believe that the overuse of cortisone creams all my life has caused some problems.

i love fish and seafood...
note that seldane is an  antihistamine that is not supposed to make you sleepy, and the ketoconazole, i  assume, is an antibiotic (because the warning mentions that it is used to treat  skin infections).

but i suppose all e sufferers share  something in common.
otherwise they are ignorant about what is helpful and  what isn't.
he thought that it was unlikely that the steroids would *cause* the keratoconus, but that it might aggravate it, simply because steroids thin the skin etc.
i went right back to nursing jodi when the expedition made no difference to her
every frustration i experience seems to require the equal and opposite reaction of scratching.
julia just had her birthday party this weekend and was clear for it!!!

i'd thought that interrupting him would just make him more frustrated, or angry (he sure reacted that way!).
shaklee basic-h is pretty neat on bad stains and it is non-toxic.
sometimes stray cats live in basements of buildings and their dander gets into the heating system and bothers cat-allergic tenants who think that they don't live with cats!
according to my "bumper book of drugs for hypochondriacs" or  whatever it is called, adverse effects from terfenadine are rare.
as this is not for life, just for a month, i expect to be able to keep it up; the only real problem i have is in finding something to eat for breakfast/lunch.
i was able to get a beautiful one year old portrait for her birthday!
there's a tremendous lack of eczema information  out there, i guess.
could it be that this beastly stuff is also killing the dust mites or neutralizing the "mite-poop" or something?
i dumped a friend largely because she was so goopy feel-sorry-for-me it made me sick.
how bad is your eczema?
already his face is looking much better -- thank god!
the only thing that i've known to give me equal satisfaction is when i can  ask a friend to gently rub my back, and of course this has to be a very close  friend, and i have to be willing to let myself sink into the feeling in my body  at the time.
my mother always told me how heartbreaking it was for her that i had eczema and not to itch it!...
yes, i know that my scratching is  just prolonging the flare-up.

eczema is no fun, but otherwise our son is a beautiful, healthy little boy and so full of joy.
we are going to see a chiro on monday on next week, while he did not think spin manip was the way to go he had a plan called b.e.s.t. that we are going to try.
the riddle of the itch here's something i've pondered for most of my lifetime.
she's still way better than before---hasn't gone that far backwards.
it's a pain to change his diapers,  though--have to take his shoes off each time.
my trick is another game--i  stick my thumb in my mouth, suck on it a second, then pull it out and scream,  then laugh.
he placed him on a special diet along with the anti histamine (periactin).
but hey, i wish him luck, and i know exactly what he is going through.

[ann, i can now empathize with your full body herpes infection.
i will be looking out for any messages you may send on your progress.
so what if the sales assistant is looking?
i do miss  that one-on-one contact with him, but he seems to be ok with it.
i do worry about enough vitamins, my homeopathic md recommended essential minerals, it did make a difference.
my son reacts strongly to smoke  filled rooms and antique stores, this is in addition to his food intollerances.
she just had chronic breakouts--every single day, worsenig as time went on.
also, i just figured out that i'm allergic to polypropylene glycol which is  in the majority of medications my doctor prescribed to me for all these years.
i've been avoiding visiting anyone with a dog for 3 weeks now and these are the  3 weeks she's been clear.
now my sweat makes me itch and burn, but probably only because my skin is broken.
although he did tell me to expect a few more cycles of good and bad times before healing.
almost all drugs have side effects of dermatitis (eczema), psoriasis,  pruritis (itching), pityriasis, etc.
i don't think my "drugs for every occasion" book exactly says terfenadine is safe.
though, if you are lucky, the condition should clear up as he gets  older.
however, i use them occasionally now that she goes a week at a  time with no new breakouts, etc.
the whole veggie is of the same shade of green.
i was on prednisone during late pregnancy when  i just couldn't stand it anymore.

if i can explain to him that i want very much to stop scratching, but need to find a way to do it that i can live with, as he needed to do with his weight, then i believe he will understand.
that is the only side effect that i  have heard of, i believe it is generally quite safe.
