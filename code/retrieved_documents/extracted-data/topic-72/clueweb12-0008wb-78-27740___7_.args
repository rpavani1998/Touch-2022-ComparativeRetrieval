children are self-directed whenever they decide what they need or want to learn, set their own goals, identify and find resources for learning, choose and use strategies for learning, or evaluate their own learning." as teachers, mentors, and homeschooling parents, we can encourage and develop self-direction in children by including them in planning their learning experiences, having them choose materials they will use, and understanding their learning style so we can support them along their learning journey.children are self-directed whenever they decide what they need or want to learn,  set their own goals, identify and find resources for learning, choose and use strategies for learning, or  evaluate their own learning." as teachers, mentors, and homeschooling parents, we can encourage and develop self-direction in children by including them in planning their learning experiences,  having them choose materials they will use, and understanding their learning style so we can support them along their learning journey.even kids with some identified learning disabilities have been found to thrive in a homeschooling environment.no matter what specific facts or skills we teach them, so long as they have the ability and confidence to learn, they are prepared for any path they choose.by spending time working one-on-one with your child, getting to know the way your child learns so you can make their learning program fit, and planning learning experiences to fit your child, you can give them that extra boost that they need to excel.even if we are very well-off financially, it's important for our children to be responsible for providing for themselves in some areas.this is something homeschoolers can do to help their kids who experience later readiness levels; teach them the same things in a different way.while i personally don’t know any homeschooled kids who have turned out so terribly bad, it stands to reason that with homeschooling families being a microcosm of our society in general, and individuals having free will, some homeschooled adults will choose things that go totally against the way they were raised.if your child has a unique learning style, or learning differences, it's easy for him or her to fall behind if left in a typical classroom setting.because we have never pushed our children through the typical schooling line-up: preschool, elementary, junior high, high school, college, each child has had to figure out on an individual basis what and how and why they want to learn.i was determined to have the time and flexibility to make sure my future children would have the visibility and guidance from me that i had lacked from my own parents.if they did not pass the tests that supposedly prove that they are learning this stuff and that supposedly prove how much they are learning, they might be labeled failures, unsatisfactory, below average, learning disabled, unmotivated, careless, unsuccessful, and so on.while this may be a somewhat important skill for kids to develop in a large classroom setting, truly gifted teachers do things that make kids want to be ready to learn when the teacher walks in the door.we also helped them find safe jobs by providing positions within family businesses, and we chauffeured them to do lawn care and odd jobs for a number of years before they were able to drive themselves.what we want to do is develop a personalized program of life and learning that works for our children, our family, and what works for me won't necessarily work for you, what works for you might not work for your neighbor, but we can all learn from each other, while we find the right path for ourselves and our loved ones.
