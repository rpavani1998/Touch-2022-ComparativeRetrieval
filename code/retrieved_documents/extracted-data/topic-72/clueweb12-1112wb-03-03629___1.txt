do  you ever think about 2nd grade and say history, math or english class was hard?
work that kids just saw as part of life and occured naturally for them in their daily activities.
it takes kids 7-8 years before they speak their native language extremely well.
additionally, adults have become accustomed to learning new thing quickly with their increase intelligence and experience.
as adults we build up language learning too much in our minds as something  hard or think it will be easy and then get discouraged when we dont speak  fluently in 30 days.

adults learning a foreign language think it is hard because they are more conscious of the effort they are exerting in order to gain this new skill and knowledge.
so do i think that it is easier for kids to learn a foreign language than adults.
it takes kids 7-8 years before they speak their native language extremely  well.
ive been thought about this for a long time and these are just some of my  personal rantings about kids vs adults in language learning.
but if you work hard you  will learn the language.

i dont think that we have supernatural powers but at the same time feel that what holds many back are our own minds.
kids just do it  because it is part of their life.

im not sure that it is an easier for younger children to learn a foreign language but it does seem that the end result is a more fluid and natural speaker of the 2nd language.
