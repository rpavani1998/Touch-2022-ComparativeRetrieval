as you can imagine, his dead friends are not all nice looking and the preview was quite scary!
overall the lorax 3d is a good movie.
the acting was wonderful and i enjoyed the animation.
she was crying that she couldn't stop thinking about it.
me and my friend went to see this movie today.
however, my 6-year-old sister was a bit worried by one particular song, so parents may want to check it out first.
the movie had great rolemodels,cute graphics and was overall an adorable family movie to go and see!
educational positive messages good role models too violent sexual behavior isn't appropriate language my kids can't use noticeable product placement too much drinking, drugs, or smoking tell other families what you think give your review a title * hang on!
i chose to take my 4 year old and even though she tells me now that it wasn't scary, there were quite a few moments that she ended up in my lap or covering her eyes; thunder and lightning before the lorax shows up, when the onceler first looks through the window, and some of the intimidation moments from the bottled air guy - i'm sure there were more.
but if ted exposes the truth to the people of thneedville, they'll realize nature isn't the dirty inconvenience they've been taught to believe.
but every cloud has a silver lining: the film would be very good for teaching bad writing.
the graphics were great.
i went opening night.
still, a great movie that pleased the adults and kids alike, excellent for the littlest ones while still enjoyable for the oldest ones including the grown-ups.
of course it teaches kids a valuable lesson to respect the environment around them with witty humour and colourful songs.
if you are protective about what your children watch on tv, do not take them to see the lorax.
helped me decide (1) | had useful details (1) | read my mind(3) gbsfan teen, 17 years old age 6 liked it i liked it, i thought it had a good message.
the movie was good even for older kids.
i hope my kid does not feel guilty for sitting on a wooden chair as it's made of the corpse of a murdered tree.
and i know the movie is rated pg, but they are marketing this film to first graders -- her teacher read the book to the class the week of the opening and they made the trees as a craft.
it's a cartoonish movie about a kids who sees dead people.
me and my friend thought some parts were really funny.
the lorax is too scary for little kids.
to those who consider the lorax dr. seuss' magnum opus, this adaptation will be at least somewhat a relief (unlike the miserable the cat in the hat ).
my first grader read the book before seeing the movie and was mesmerized by the story.
it's light and sweet and frames the original story in an easy-to-understand plot about a boy who wants to impress his tree-obsessed crush.
i wish i knew the movie was cute and not too far out of the realm of the book.
- movie themes & details what to talk about talk to your kids - families can talk about the lorax's messages.
if it weren't an adaptation,the lorax would make for a fun, message-filled movie with a charming set of characters.
as you can imagine, his dead friends are not all nice looking and the preview was quite scary!

the lorax teaches a valuable lesson about the importance of the natural world and protecting natural resources.

as ted learns more about the history of the truffula trees that the once-ler chopped down, his life is thneedville is challenged by the town's bigwig, mr. o'hare (rob riggle), who profits from the manufactured air that the citizens have been taught to buy and breathe.
it sneaks some product placement in the movie, but it's fine.
this movie was super cute and funny it good movie for all ages very funny the lorax was so funny and storying is very easy unstand for even little kids messenger save the trees was very good too is best movie take kids too jokes were kid friendly unlike some movies i would take whole family !
unfortunately kids may be confused by these positive messages once they realize how many product tie-ins are associated with the movie (see "consumerism" section).
it's cheaper and easier.
kids will surely delight inthe lorax, but teens and parents savvy enough to recognize the irony of big-studio consumerism may wonder whether dr. seuss would have approved at all.
positive role models: at first ted is driven purely by his feelings for audrey, but then he decides to learn the story of the lorax and the truffula trees for himself and to help his entire town; ultimately he turns out to be a brave guy who stands up for what's right.
the theme of environmental responsibility was not at all preachy, but conveyed simply enough so that my son said he felt sad when they cut down the last tree.
nothing lasted long and everything ends well, but if you have a sensitive child, there may be a moment or two with their face in your shoulder.
the lorax is about a brave boy who tries to impress a girl gets involved into a battle of the trees.
message in this movie is that you cut a tree you are a murderer.
on the negative side, the once-ler breaks his promise and allows his family to convince him to chop down all the trees to make a profit.
the storyline moved quickly, and the graphics and characters were developed enough to support the storyline.
this kind of movie as they are highly political and never offer a constructive message as to using the planets resources responsibly (i.e. trees).
age 6 liked it i liked it, i thought it had a good message.
however, based on what i read from this site's review, i formed the opinion that there weren't really any scary moments.
spend their money on packaging, not nutritional content.
the movie go to an over reach attempt to demonize business man or the use of natural resources.
the only thing that disappointed was the car thing, i am not sure if they should have used an suv in this type of movie.
the movie's 3-d (tree-d) is not worth the watch though.
the star-studded voice cast does a fine job (the main characters are even named after dr. seuss -- theodore geisel -- and his widow, audrey), and the songs are all upbeat, if not randy newman-memorable.
the once-ler redeems the greedy acts of his past.
it does the book justice completely.
violence & scariness: the once-ler employs a huge machine attached to axes to chop down the truffula trees.
positive messages: like the book, the movie promotes an environmental message about conservation.

kids will leave the film wanting to do more to help the natural world ... too bad that take-away will be diluted by the onslaught of available merchandise with the lorax's bright-orange image on it.
i think the movie was fine for her to watch, but the trailer was not!
while the movie was as enjoyable as we thought it would be and the story was charming and the kids gave it thumbs up, the parents left the theater a bit disappointed--movie didn't give us a "wow--that was amazing" feeling like we'd hoped and expected it to.
i saw this movie with one of my friends and we both loved it even though we're teenagers!
seuss' book, the studio has agreed to more than 70 merchandise tie-ins, from the standard stuffed animals and figurines to the more egregious ihop pancake platter and mazda suv promotions (the latter has included school events in which kids are urged to ask their parents to test-drive the vehicle).
enjoyable for all ages, just minus the "wow" for parents.
having the lorax shill for an suv or themed breakfasts is counter to the spirit of the story -- which, at least in the movie, promotes a return to nature.

age 14 junk food for your eyes and ears this movie is not for children who can't already recognize that attitudes expressed in a film may not be appropriate or representative of real life.
audrey and grandma subvert the conventional idea that having plastic trees -- plasticeverything -- is better than real nature.
my movie theater showed a trailer to paranorman which totally freaked out my kids -- 1st and 3rd grade.
the theme of environmental responsibility was not at all preachy, but conveyed simply enough so that my son said he felt sad when they cut down the last tree.

it's a cartoonish movie about a kids who sees dead people.
as i expected, it was funny, clever, slightly sad, and kind of dark at places.
the movie was good even for older kids.
i just came back from watching this movie with my 5 year old kid.

the movie will make kids think about where their stuff comes from, whether having too much stuff is a good thing, and what the consequences of their actions might be.
especially my 1st grader who only watched a second of it before covering her eyes for the remainder.
i chose to take my 4 year old and even though she tells me now that it wasn't scary, there were quite a few moments that she ended up in my lap or covering her eyes; thunder and lightning before the lorax shows up, when the onceler first looks through the window, and some of the intimidation moments from the bottled air guy - i'm sure there were more.

a few characters are hit in the face with various objects (marshmallows, a hammer), but there's no lasting harm.

ted is a courageous boy and audrey is passionate about the environment.
the problem is that passionate lovers of the lorax will expect more; they'll hope for a movie as timeless and important as seuss' subversive commentary on the perils of conspicuous consumption and forsaking the environment to benefit the almighty dollar.
a safe community is important to us.
the ending was very uplifting and the charectors were completely fleshed out.
although common sense media notes consumerism, i couldn't really find a mention of any products, and neither could the three people i went with.
the scariest part was actually one of the previews for a movie called "paranorman".
well i have not seen this movie yet but just wanted to remeined parents that this is rated pg ok not g ps also the basic plot is a guy who has a crush on a girl hope this helps what other families should know good role models sexual behavior isn't appropriate flag as inappropriate was this review useful?
i think the movie was fine for her to watch, but the trailer was not!
if you are protective about what your children watch on tv, do not take them to see the lorax.
when young ted (voiced byzac efron) discovers that what his crush, audrey (taylor swift), wants more than anything is to see a real tree, he sets out to find one for her.
she would need to be at least 6yo to appreciate this movie.
the main issue here is really the movie's huge number of consumerist tie-ins -- at least 70 different marketing promotions.
my movie theater showed a trailer to paranorman which totally freaked out my kids -- 1st and 3rd grade.
nothing lasted long and everything ends well, but if you have a sensitive child, there may be a moment or two with their face in your shoulder.
however, based on what i read from this site's review, i formed the opinion that there weren't really any scary moments.
review it - 33% say there are positive role models - 33% say there are positive messages what parents need to know parents need to know that this animated adaptation of dr. seuss' beloved tale of the lorax is age-appropriate for younger kids; there's little scary stuff, and the pro-environmental message is a positive one.
still, the movie itself -- like the original story -- promotes conservation and protecting the environment.
especially my 1st grader who only watched a second of it before covering her eyes for the remainder.
she was crying that she couldn't stop thinking about it.
the storyline moved quickly, and the graphics and characters were developed enough to support the storyline.

i hope my kid does not feel guilty for sitting on a wooden chair as it's made of the corpse of a murdered tree.
at one point, the once-ler and a baby barbaloot are floating on a mattress toward a waterfall, but neither is injured.
it also suggests the danger of giving into materialistic impulses that can damage the environment.

for an anti-materialism story to advertise so many products to kids and their parents sends a particularly confusing message.
overall really good movie.
my first grader read the book before seeing the movie and was mesmerized by the story.
