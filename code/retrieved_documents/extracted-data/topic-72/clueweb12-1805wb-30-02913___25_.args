by providing a small and easy to learn programming language in a friendly and inviting development environment, small basic makes programming a breeze.there are those that aim to convey a basic understanding of the concepts and those that are advanced and therefore might assist teachers with their professional development activities.it is our hope that this resource will evolve based on feedback from teachers, and ultimately end up as teaching plans that are built on the resources.the goal is to help all of us to find inspiration, help each other, find interesting material, and ultimately to improve our teaching.students will learn the importance of written communication skills and sequential thinking while trying to write a computer program on how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.the idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another.ideal for kids and adults alike, small basic helps beginners take the first step into the wonderful world of programming., it exposes students to the idea of open-source development, and also programming language design.this tutorial goes way beyond the levels required for high schools, but is a good reference material.this poster will make a nice addition to the classroom to start discussions and students can explore the languages from any year/decade as a project.students can get a feel of many languages, their syntax and the concept of debugging.it will enable the reader to make comparisons and generalisations.- annales mathematicae et informaticae has an interesting research paper is ict teaching methods – programming languages that discusses the fact that the methods used in teaching programming languages, as “languages”, are far from being near to those of natural languages with respect to their elaborateness, quality and, unfortunately, efficiency.comprehensive list of resources that relate to this standard the resources below are a mixture that were developed for a varied audience ranging from high school students to university undergraduates, therefore we have attempted to classify the resources in terms of their readiness to be used by teachers.to demonstrate the need to formalise everyday language, do some exercises for everyday tasks as a precursor to learning pseudocode later.
