i would have to say that this restaurant is really better suited to adults dining without children than those dining with them.
the attraction is named liberty square riverboat, but the ship itself is named the liberty belle.
in a way, i wish disney would categorize their restaurants a bit more to help guide visitors (which restaurants are appropriate for families with children, and which are best for groups without children), so it's easier to choose which restaurants will be best for you.
the weather is perfect.
soups, salads, sandwiches, chicken, bbq chicken, burgers and yummy desserts.
if you've ever been to disney you know that it's tough to plan days around meals and it's sometimes easier to just grab a burger or a sandwich at a quick service place.
but they cost the same as disneysized portions, so not the best bargain for a family.
even though we didn't like the way it worked out, because i am lazy i just went ahead and planned for it again for our2009 trip.
we didn't order an appetizer as we had the dining plan and well, appetizers aren't included in the plan.
let's not forget sonny eclipse, the animatronic lounge singer.
warm but not hot, very little rain and perfect sleeping temperatures!
i really enjoyed my experience here, but that's because i'm a solo adult.
also, i can't forget to mention epcot'sflower and garden festival - we love seeing all the beautiful flowers and topiary all over epcot!
we've hadhorrible snow storms this month and well, while you'd think this is when i would want to go to florida and enjoy the sunshine i gotta tell ya, i would not want to come home to snow!
but of course we would have loved to have been closer to the aquarium.
oh well, i suppose it wouldn't be worth it to disney as i am sure an appetizer probably cost more than a dessert.
or you wind up disappointed because the kids can't see as well as they want because they're sitting across the room.
the cons: the pros: - not much flexibility - you get what’s included, with no substitutions - we really didn’t want two desserts each day (one with our quick service lunch and one with our table service dinner).
the dark colors coupled with dim lighting made everything seem drab.
last year by the time we had to head home the temperature was already starting to reach the mid-90's, so yea, that was reaching hot status for me.
while this is a nice idea, it's kind of a pain when everyone in your party wants something different because you then have to get in different lines.
it was just easier to pay a flat rate for food and be done with it.
in 2009 appetizers still were not part of the basic dining plan, nor was gratuity so for just about every meal we paid something out of pocket.
if you could swap appetizers for desserts.
whereas i was in the middle of the room, and that was a fine view for me.
i've been trying to think of rides and attractions that would be a wonderful experience for my grandmother on our upcoming trip and i really think she will enjoy a 20 minute ride on this legendary riverboat!
on the bright side, the food was tasty but for the portions, i think it was overpriced.
in a nutshell, it depends on your style of eating.
we sometimes like a nice dinner to finish off the day but then again, depending on our plans for the day, dinner might just be a burger and fries, topped off with some ice cream!
i really didn't have anything to share with wyatt so i wound up having to order something for him and paying out of pocket.
well for us, we felt compelled to have a sit down meal every day, to get our money's worth.
i live in pennsylvania so by the time april rolls around i am so ready to be somewhere warm.
if you eat at an upscale restaurant, you can order the $30 entrée without concern.
normally we like a big breakfast and then just graze during the day, we don't even necessarily need a quick service meal (or a 'lunch')

we plan on having breakfasts in the villa and we will also have plenty of snacks with us as well.
whereas i was in the middle of the room, and that was a fine view for me.
we don't usually want a dessert with every table service but sometimes like to have appetizers.
in the end though, we still paid extra money,again.
and as you say, the portion sizes are what i would call "normal", certainly not the usual disneysized portions, so while perfect for my appetite, i wouldn't have been able to share it with anyone without walking away hungry.
but they cost the same as disneysized portions, so not the best bargain for a family.
i will admit, when we got inside i was a bit surprised, it wasn't the atmosphere i expected.
i say no - we ate there last trip and were very disappointed.
i really enjoyed my experience here, but that's because i'm a solo adult.
those are my only 2 'complaints' because really it was an awesome experience.
in fact, we typically don't want dessert at all.
now, i am talking about the basic plan because that is what we used.
warm but not hot, very little rain and perfect sleeping temperatures!

but it was fine, we just sat outside the restaurant for a bit and relaxed.
while the ship looks straight out of the 19th century, it was actually built in a dry dock on disney property for the 1971 opening of walt disney world resort.
if you could swap appetizers for desserts.
well, of course i always wish i were in disney world (most seconds of the day) but honestly, there is no way i would want to be in the happiest place on earth and then come home to snow and cold temperatures!

we ordered them because they came with the meal and we paid for them but we prefer appetizers, which aren’t included.
what you found to be "dreary" decor, i found to be typical adult restaurant colors and soothing, dim lighting.
heck, $42 a day for 1 meal, 1 quick service and 1 snack and you get 1 resort-refillable drink mug per person.

2010 dining plan this year we won't be using the dining plan.
we didn't order an appetizer as we had the dining plan and well, appetizers aren't included in the plan.
i know this isn't the case for you, but many families will only go to wdw once in their lifetimes, and i'm sure they want to make sure it's the best possible experience without any disappointments.

i realize it was supposed to mimic being in the ocean and well, obviously the ocean isn't bright and colorful...or is it?
not your typical disney themed restaurant with bright colors that would appeal to families with children.

there are so many other restaurants we would love to try and of course, we have our favorites so the coral reef was a once and done.
the 17-minute trip is around tom sawyer island; the liberty belle is a faithful reproduction of the highly ornate vessels that proudly ferried people and cargo up and down the mighty mississippi river.
- can be stressful because you can find yourself planning your vacation around meals.

i would have to say that this restaurant is really better suited to adults dining without children than those dining with them.
the inside of the restaurant is designed like the lobby of a spaceship and is separated into 3 different ordering sections: bay 1 - bbq chicken and ribs bay 2 - hot dogs and burgers bay 3 - double cheese burgers and salads while this is a nice idea, it's kind of a pain when everyone in your party wants something different because you then have to get in different lines.

here is the review: after experiencing the nemo ride and checking out the aquarium for a bit, we decided to head over to thecoral reef restaurant.
can be stressful because you can find yourself planning your vacation around meals.
this is due not only to past experience but also to us now being dvc members.
this time is perfect, to us at least, because it's after all the spring break hoopla, after easter break and before memorial day weekend.
the kids were fairly well behaved.

- you can’t “carry over” unused portions of a meal credit – you can’t get the entrée and drink at a quick service restaurant, then get the dessert later at a different restaurant.
