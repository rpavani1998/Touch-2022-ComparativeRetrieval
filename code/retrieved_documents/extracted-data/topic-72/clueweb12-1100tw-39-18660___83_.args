for us, it’s really important to value his education, make sure he has healthy food available, and that we have a lot of time together as a family.negative population growth is not good for an economy that continuously needs more money pumped into it to survive.if you want a productive, tax-paying youth to mature and contribute so that our entire society can be taken care of in the future, the focus for all of us is how to stop the bleeding.older kids eat more and wear out their clothes; far more significantly, they want to take gymnastics and music lessons and go to day camps during the summer.we live comfortably on just under $90k per year, we have no non-mortgage debt, and we are able to save for retirement.not only more space, but as you get older there is pressure to live in a town with a good public school system, nice parks & playgrounds, and safe.smaller cohorts mean more labor demand and higher salaries for people born during a baby bust.you could end up with a baby/child that’s perfectly happy, healthy and wise, or you could end up with a baby/child who has special needs, requires more attention/money than another.fewer children means fewer tax payers to support an aging population.(of course, some kids in foster care have serious emotional, physical, or cognitive issues, but no child is guaranteed to be free of such problems.)babies have the initial costs of crib/stroller/clothing/etc, but many can be obtained secondhand for little or no money.if you have a fantastic network of friends and family who will assist and support you if things get tough (as i do), then you can feel a little more confident about having children even if your financial situation isn’t perfect.you can be creative and find ways to save with food, clothes, childcare, transportation, housing, etc.for instance, two weekly music lessons; participation in theater groups, bands, and choirs; camps; sports; and public school fees add up to $3000-$4000 a year.yet our poor abused kids turned out to be competent, independent adults with many skills that are getting paid more than the friends’ and relatives’ kids who got a free ride through college.
