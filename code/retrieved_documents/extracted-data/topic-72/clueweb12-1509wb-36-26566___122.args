counting hours now, i know it was the 48 hour post shot reaction.
i don't think it's very pleasureable to "spout," altho it may be necessary.
they're playing different games with different folk.
it's very black and kind of yucky, and it makes the bath water smell like a roofing job on a hot summer day, but it really makes my skin feel good.
from: ralph subject: more tar madness my doctor (actually his associate, whom i've not met face-to-face) told me that no one really knows why it works.
if an "antimitotic" agent can slow down this process, it is conceivable that it can provide some benefit.
kris, though i do try to limit my contact with people who annoy or anger me (i'll be working at home more now in part because i'm in a cubicle surrounded by inanity all day), i like some contact and support.
this discussion on anger intrigues me since i have come to believe that venting anger more easily may very well increase the level of anger one attains more easily, and, therefore a "ventor" of anger may actually operate at a higher anger level most of the time because becoming angry happens more easily and venting is a pleasureable, ok activity if that makes sense to anyone else.
when i was flaring so bad when i first started allergy shots, it was always about 48 hours after a shot.
for girls, it is even harder because our culture judges females on our looks 99%. .
this delayed response -- it takes the t-cells (they're generals) "time" to communicate down the ranks to effector molecules (they're the grunts who do the fighting) -- is a sign that the skin is protecting itself.
for me, it's most important to feel "clean", dryness is lower priority.
i do this in private (unless i'm at the therapy group) because other people usually feel scared or disturbed by it.
it would be something clean and convenient to add to our bath water.
according to this line of thinking, the young child's sensory apparatus is overwhelmed with the itching, and doesn't process other sensations like hunger very well.
zetar's label states that the tar is dissolved in polysorbates.
perhaps a number of medical people don't really appreciate that; maybe they're accustomed to needing a staph explosion or a herpetic crisis to warrant "medical advice."
i take soaking baths (20 to 40 mins) whenever i get that dry-all-over feeling.
facts and ideas don't always match, however.
tylenol for kids might help take the edge off your child's nerves--i used to take heavy duty transquilizers--a mere palliative but it makes one so dopey and lethargic.
the main reason that he's doing a houdini is because it itches.
it didn't do much for me and i must say that i was glad when i stopped using it.
ezra has it quite bad on his face, mostly on his cheeks and a little on his forehead, neck and chest.
i skip breakfast entirely now becuz there's just not much to bother with anymore.
from: shelley subject: re: food richard: i am extremely allergic to nuts and seeds, and avoid or reduce intake of caffeine, sugar, salt, citrus, and dairy products to keep my condition under control.
what worked best for me is when i learned to tuck my hands under my butt and pretend they were paralyzed.
i've used phisoderm for soaping, cetaphil lately, and some bar soaps that are gentle without perfumes.
i also think the vibration of the razor serves as a scratch substitute and i am experimenting with this on the arms too.
i soak my hands in this stuff, mixed into a basin of warm water, and it helps a great deal.
i keep trying to debride them, esp right after a shower because the skin is softened.
i agree with ralph and feel that too many people (including doctors) spend too much time pussy-footing around with the treatment of ad in infants.
i feel like ingrid bergman, who when she was told she had lung cancer, kept right on smoking to the end!
perhaps you would agree that the psyche is a big factor in eczema now that you've come back to the ratrace.
this consists of using a soft, padded bat or a pillow to beat something like a bed or a couch.
what works for me is taking a shower once a day and totally greasing up after that.
when so, it's probably because there (is/was) a follicular conjunctivitis that's claimed squatter's rights and become chronic -- and sometimes secretively so.
but, the general pattern is that we should not be surprised to find a patient presenting with atopic dermatitis who also has food allergies, or asthma, or "hay fever".
i also shower at least once daily, sometimes more when i'm having more problems.
after soak i grease up.
this is not casual contact, it's outright forceful blood-to-blood impregnation and is indistinguishable from other impregnations such as the sharing of "dirty needles.
sometimes blowing it off takes the pressure off the "cooker."
i'm especially interested in those of you who have large areas of eczema.
when the hand coverings were new and i couldn't itch effectively, i used to scratch as far as possible using my toenails!
i can testify that not much happens to improve eczema once a woman hits menopause---it just means you have some more miserable symptoms to contend with.
the eye doctor is the one who told me it was a virus and if not removed could cause blindness.
maybe it was the placebo effect or the stress and crying i mentioned above, but skin and sinuses got better and the lymph node went way down.
by the way, i don't think the smell is noticable to anyone else.
i don't think it's very pleasureable to "spout," altho it may be necessary.
as a health officer in the field of infectious disease i engage in both clinical and research areas of immuno(in)competence and, especially, aids.
but the washes are time consuming and can precipitate nose bleeds.
she still suffers almost constant itching, flaking, thin skin and naturally the scratches she inflicts on herself.
at night i wash my face with cetaphil liquid cleanser and put eucerin creme all over.
these are slippery slopes -- for lay people and for physicians; they're slippery for basic scientists as well: immunologists and bench scientists get confounded too.
hence, communication.
when i'm wet and then creamed up, i feel more "loose" with more freely moving joints--if that makes any sense.
comments kristen, the saline nasal washes are intended to clear out secretions in the hope of preventing an infection in the sinuses.
but because it was "just a skin" problem , we missed out on whatever counseling was available for those with more serious handicaps.
moisturizers equally so.
am constantly "soaking" my head in the shower (along with the rest of me) every nite.
many infants with atopic dermatitis are clear of it by their second birthday but to wait a year and a half would be a little unfair to the child.
i also became acquainted with someone who does psychic healing.
milk was substituted.
i'm not interested in someone's latest foray to the grocery store, if you know what i mean.
i don't like this as much because the oil seems to be counter-productive for me, often causing additional itchiness.
surely someone could take a look at a *known* therapeutic agent and figure out why it works...
finally, i just got tired of it.
i limit myself to a few good friends and superficial contacts with others, but i'm more interested in the life of the mind than in what passes for conversation on a daily basis--most of it less than profound.
most meat makes be gag if i have to fix my own, so i stick with veggie casseroles and vegburgers, things like that.
if an "antimitotic" agent can slow down this process, it is conceivable that it can provide some benefit.
she also said that i probably have some blocked emotions that can be adding to my condition.
ann and eczema community: re swollen lymph nodes...mine swell when i have staph infections.
if i had a fortune for demonstrating a case of casual-contact infection from aids, i'd remain penniless for it.
i think the homeopathic stuff may have strengthened nadia's immune system, because after the regimine was complete she almost never had staph infections.
since i have this drat eczema virtually all over, i oil myself up several times a day, and try to shower only every other day to keep from drying out.
later i learned to touch my fingertips together one by one in a slow repetitive pattern that was hypnotic and calming.
wet and dry wren, i am sometimes affected 95% of skin surface, now it is primarily dry over 50% of surface (i saw a tip from the national jewish center that said that the palm of the hand is about one percent of body...
i don't emote easily, though i speak my mind more frequently and vehemently than i did earlier in life.
i think your dermatologist, however, communicated well in referring you on to an eye specialist.
of course, i'm not saying that hands are the culprit, but whenever i think of routes by which skin infections get launched, i always think: hands.
the buzz from itching there (with q tips) is so intense, i have come very close to blacking out.
i 'm hoping that as my condition improves the red-brown will revert to my god-given olive white-yellow color.
we say to the patient, "come back in two days so i can read your skin."
it was quite expensive eating that kind of diet.
i use cetaphil bar soap on underarms, crotch, and feet.
if the active ingredient(s) were known, i suspect we wouldn't have to use smelly black stuff.
one's level of anger may be commensurate with an incident; because sometimes anger is very justified.

sometimes i'm under the shower long enough to feel "soaked," and then i make sure i cream up all over as much as possible.
though atopic dermatitis is a disease state, the cellular immune response is exactly what we try to elicit when we test folk for tb: we want the cellular branch of the is to mount a response.
i skip breakfast entirely now becuz there's just not much to bother with anymore.
i put eucerin creme on all over after drying.
i don't have large areas of eczema (yet - knock wood), but all of my skin can get itchy and uncomfortable if i shower too often.
while we're definitely dealing with physical forces (heredity; repetitive-use stress; environmental agents -- you name it!), there are psychological forces and "tempers" that confound clinician and patient alike.
as a health officer in the field of infectious disease i engage in both clinical and research areas of immuno(in)competence and, especially, aids.
copyright of the individual messages rests with those who posted them.
since then i get them removed within 6 months, but they've never gone away by themselves.
water gives me the most relief--comfort level is very important to me so that i can concentrate on other things.
eczema, however, in the context of its effect, can be a cause for infection insofar as its lesions can lead to a violation of skin integrity, whether that violation is primary or secondary.
more than about twice a week tends to cause discomfort.
perhaps you would agree that the psyche is a big factor in eczema now that you've come back to the ratrace.
after that, it was like eating plain grain; it would all crumble and fall apart in your hands.
you said it took 2 days for the skin immune system to react to allergens (as in a tb test).
for me, it's most important to feel "clean", dryness is lower priority.
blepharitis (i.e., inflammation of the eyelids) and conjunctivitis can sometimes be associated with molluscum.
i hope that i'm not being too outspoken but i've seen too many children (and indirectly, their parents) suffer unneccessarily from this attitude (which basically arises from ignorance).
if you are interested in the bar soaps, i'll check on the names.
i remember using tar in my late teens and early 20s--detested the smell, was sure everyone could tell it and would think i had a bad case of body odor.
veg pizza is a big favorite--no grease.
i also wash my hair in the shower, which then becomes a 15-20 minute job.
i'm wondering if i was better able to express my sadness and pain, somehow that might lead to an overall release and possibly skin improvement.
that can be anything from frustrating people to irritating situations.
my son was small for his age, eating very little, at the time we finally had him seen by the dermatologist.
i keep trying to debride them, esp right after a shower because the skin is softened.
they're playing different games with different folk.
i feel like ingrid bergman, who when she was told she had lung cancer, kept right on smoking to the end!
lowe and his group showed that coal tar has "antimitotic effects" and proposes that that might account for some of its action and effect.
sometimes blowing it off takes the pressure off the "cooker."
so get little houdini treated and maybe he won't be stuck with the nickname for life.
" people with open skin lesions feel vulnerable to both the facts of infection and to the idea of infection.
i threw off the placid mantle because i was tired of being treated like a doormat.
now i wouldn't be without it, because it's the only thing that soothes in a certain way when i'm very itchy and cracked.
this forum, too, is a module for communication and brings its own eye witnesses.
am constantly "soaking" my head in the shower (along with the rest of me) every nite.
a doctor at work diagnosed mumps, but it wasn't mumps.
i either reply "thank you" or explain that i have a skin condition that makes my skin look this way.
i think it is better to find ways to vent anger than bottle it up.
my mother used to make me wear soft leggings/mitts/gloves over my hands especially when i was a small kid.
houdini dear eric, please have ezra seen to by a dermatologist if you've not already done so.
i use water to wash off all the dead skin and doctor the new stuff underneath.
so, i would wonder about contact allergies.
we adults sometimes underestimate kids' intelligence--they know a lot of things at gut level whether adults spell it out for them or not.
also, if you use nasal steroids, you want to get your nostrils as clear as possible before spraying so that the drug gets where it is supposed to go.
hi ralph, you make the tar "toilet" sound very appealing.
fingers) can carry bacteria and viruses better than any inanimate fomite i know of.
if the active ingredient(s) were known, i suspect we wouldn't have to use smelly black stuff.
but one day i got shots; then left the next day on a trip to asia.
i cannot emphasize enough that it's an awful thing to do to a child.
ralph, i've never tried using tar products.
if i'm in really good condition, i might skip a shower for one night, but the daily showering keeps the itch down, and the sensation of not feeling "dirty" from loose skin particles.
we've been to most of the dermatologists in local practice, as well as a homeopathic clinic.
the array of variables (situation, time; circumstance, environment) makes for confusion.
this is where the "cellular branch" of the immune system comes in: t-cells->intermediate reactions->eczematic "atopic" dermatitis.

as we approached hong kong, i really flared (assuming it was the peanut dust in the airplane air).
restraints may have helped me keep from scratching for certain periods of time but psychologically they were the worst thing for me.
the scenarios were in hospital where nurses used their unprotected hands (their hands had open and bleeding lesions) to compress bloody wounds on patients infected with hiv.

my skin is really good.
i don't know what the polysorbates do, but the result is excellent.
but sometimes i feel dry-itchy and need spot wash with creams; sometimes i put on too much ointment and it's too greasy and the skin needs to breathe; other times i can tell that it's probably getting infected
i recommend keeping the fingernails extremely short, encouraging the child to hold something in the hand at night, bite the arm or whatever's in reach, or to pinch or slap the skin lightly instead of scratching, but don't tie them down!
if this is the case, it seems to be due to the toxic effect of viral particles (i.e., incomplete virions) that have gotten shed.
because i don't like to tolerate the sloughing (it can be embarrassing), i shower every night--short showers, maybe 5 minutes.
rarely get swollen glands/lymph nodes anymore.

i don't like to think that anger is bad just because it's anger.
hi wren, i pretty much have eczema from head to toe in varying degrees.
(when i'm feeling impoverished and using vaseline, idon't dry myself at all.)
clearly, we don't have easy answers because we don't have an easy problem.
my mother used to make me wear soft leggings/mitts/gloves over my hands especially when i was a small kid.
i went to an eye doctor for the surgery since my dermatologist said he didn't feel comfortable working in the delicate area of the eye.
he was my idol as a child because my parents would tie me up in restraints (handcuffs, strait jackets, ropes, chains, you name it) to keep me from scratching but i would always figure out how to escape - a la houdini!
rather than just complaining, better to take some kind of action.
many infants with atopic dermatitis are clear of it by their second birthday but to wait a year and a half would be a little unfair to the child.
we've begun to call him houdini because he is quite creative in getting his hands free (a little sense of humor goes a long way with this, no?).
for example, if a contact dermatitis arises due to, say, allergies caused by agents like eye drops or cosmetics, the irritation can provide a seeding bed for molluscum or, for that matter, for any pathogenic contaminant.
since one of the troubles with psoriasis and some eczemas is the observed "thickening" of the skin which tends to "crack" and form "scales," we're observing a phenomenon called "hyperplasia," i.e., the skin's over-achiever attempt to regenerate and displace "because of the injury."

over time i wore holes right through the cloth because itching was beyond my control.
in other words, coal tar discourages cell replication.
from: kristen subject: re: re[2]: bathing wren, i've never actually documented--just recall skin problems when my psychic health was less than optimal; and nonexistent when i was happy with my life.

my patience level with inanity is nil these days, so i find myself keeping my own company more and more out of personal choice.
ann and eczema community: re swollen lymph nodes...mine swell when i have staph infections.
books are usually more interesting to me than people.
i don't like the aimless busyness i see all around me--not much of sense behind the busyness generally.
in point of fact and in point of frequency: type i and type iv hypersensitivity reactions usually belong as symptoms within the same set of individuals.
i was taught never to show emotions, so it is second nature to bottle things up--not good for skin.
i was totally unaware then of what time it was (my watch was on asian time).
but, the general pattern is that we should not be surprised to find a patient presenting with atopic dermatitis who also has food allergies, or asthma, or "hay fever".
i takes the nodes' swelling as a signal that something's different that is going on in my system, and that my body is responding.
the array of variables (situation, time; circumstance, environment) makes for confusion.
i soak my hands in this stuff, mixed into a basin of warm water, and it helps a great deal.
nadia accepted it gratefully, and gave me a knowing glance that was so ripe with meaning it broke my heart.
of course, i'm not saying that hands are the culprit, but whenever i think of routes by which skin infections get launched, i always think: hands.
hi jack---i think it's heartwarming that your daughter can communicate with you just using expressions!
but after 2 days of not showering, i feel like a little disgusting grease ball.
i also shower at least once daily, sometimes more when i'm having more problems.
i've lived alone since i was 27--big change at the time, but i wouldn't go back to the chaos i grew up in.
i do this in private (unless i'm at the therapy group) because other people usually feel scared or disturbed by it.
i tried to live with them but eventually decided i couldn't stand looking at them anymore.
re: bathing thanks to all of you who have responded to my question about our bathing regimens.
i don't see it so much as proactive, as fighting for the return of my former healthy skin.
because i don't like to tolerate the sloughing (it can be embarrassing), i shower every night--short showers, maybe 5 minutes.
so i prefer more water rather than less to keep myself functioning--also, as a safety measure against infection.
even when in intense pain from my eczema, i'll just barely whimper.
a black tub afterwards doesn't appeal to me though!
i remember using tar in my late teens and early 20s--detested the smell, was sure everyone could tell it and would think i had a bad case of body odor.
what works for me is taking a shower once a day and totally greasing up after that.
this discussion on anger intrigues me since i have come to believe that venting anger more easily may very well increase the level of anger one attains more easily, and, therefore a "ventor" of anger may actually operate at a higher anger level most of the time because becoming angry happens more easily and venting is a pleasureable, ok activity if that makes sense to anyone else.
i put eucerin creme on all over after drying.
i only get them on my face.
hence, communication.
i can't stand the gooiness of heavy oils, altho occasionally i've used small amounts of vitamin e oil i apply diprolene to my scalp immediately when after a shower when my hair is still wet--it doesn't seem to grease up my hair as much as when the hair is dry.
the dermatologist prescribed his usual combination of oral antibiotics, tar baths, and twice-daily applications of diprolene (steriod) ointment.
of course, sometimes i misinterpret the feeling and that causes more problems, but basically, it's learning my own body language and forms of communication.
" people with open skin lesions feel vulnerable to both the facts of infection and to the idea of infection.
this delayed response -- it takes the t-cells (they're generals) "time" to communicate down the ranks to effector molecules (they're the grunts who do the fighting) -- is a sign that the skin is protecting itself.
i either reply "thank you" or explain that i have a skin condition that makes my skin look this way.
any phenomenon around the eye is "hands off" for nonspecialists to my way of thinking.
i was too young and stupid and embarrassed; now i wish i had shot back, "leprosy."
so, i would wonder about contact allergies.
the eye doctor is the one who told me it was a virus and if not removed could cause blindness.
wonder if the alpha-keri doesn't have some "additive" that is the reason for the itchiness.
once in a while now i pick up a pillow and beat something with it.
but don't use your best white towel with it, as it does stain to some extent.
the buzz from itching there (with q tips) is so intense, i have come very close to blacking out.
(my feet are pretty clear).
comments ann, i've had sinusitis for so many years i probably wouldn't know if i had an infection or not--i just have constant runny nose and eyes.
this is not casual contact, it's outright forceful blood-to-blood impregnation and is indistinguishable from other impregnations such as the sharing of "dirty needles.
i've lived alone since i was 27--big change at the time, but i wouldn't go back to the chaos i grew up in.
i'm especially interested in those of you who have large areas of eczema.
i'm not good at close relationships--they make me uncomfortable.
i don't have large areas of eczema (yet - knock wood), but all of my skin can get itchy and uncomfortable if i shower too often.
my son was small for his age, eating very little, at the time we finally had him seen by the dermatologist.
now i wouldn't be without it, because it's the only thing that soothes in a certain way when i'm very itchy and cracked.
the product i like is called zetar, made by dermik laboratories, collegeville, pa, and it's a prescription item.
she said to her, "oh, you poor thing, must have fallen off your bicycle, here's a cookie, darling."
unfortunately, i cannot say the same when it comes to staph infections (there are too many to list here) and a number of other *bacterial* agents which can present problems to folks with open skin lesions.
i don't like to think that anger is bad just because it's anger.
i know mine is the result of overuse of steroids that were much too strong for too long a period, like 10 yrs.
at least, i would not want to forget them.
any phenomenon around the eye is "hands off" for nonspecialists to my way of thinking.
i agree with ralph and feel that too many people (including doctors) spend too much time pussy-footing around with the treatment of ad in infants.
i itch more from too much grease than i do from dryness.
one immune system with two branches (humoral and cellular).
also, if you use nasal steroids, you want to get your nostrils as clear as possible before spraying so that the drug gets where it is supposed to go.
water gives me the most relief--comfort level is very important to me so that i can concentrate on other things.
i don't emote easily, though i speak my mind more frequently and vehemently than i did earlier in life.
scientists gell and coombs also classified and termed cell-mediated hypersensitivity which they dubbed "type iv hypersensitivity."
apparently the lymph nodes produce some wbcs to fight off the infection.
if this is the case, it seems to be due to the toxic effect of viral particles (i.e., incomplete virions) that have gotten shed.
it's very black and kind of yucky, and it makes the bath water smell like a roofing job on a hot summer day, but it really makes my skin feel good.
i got all the gluten-free cookbooks and made my own rice bread, etc.
since one of the troubles with psoriasis and some eczemas is the observed "thickening" of the skin which tends to "crack" and form "scales," we're observing a phenomenon called "hyperplasia," i.e., the skin's over-achiever attempt to regenerate and displace "because of the injury."
fingers) can carry bacteria and viruses better than any inanimate fomite i know of.
unresolved anger is worst of all--so now i take definite steps to remove myself from chaos.
restraints may have helped me keep from scratching for certain periods of time but psychologically they were the worst thing for me.
i feel better after showering, but am dryer, especially my scalp.
professionally (and therefore personally), i do not worry about possible contact contamination such as a handshake, a kiss -- casual social gestures -- in the context of the hiv virus.
an open skin contact would need to be a compression lock against blood-exposing skin from someone with hiv -- and it would require some "time" to enable viral transfer.
i'm sorry you've had repeated bouts with our (usually) "benign" and "lazy" virus.
i was totally unaware then of what time it was (my watch was on asian time).
the scenarios were in hospital where nurses used their unprotected hands (their hands had open and bleeding lesions) to compress bloody wounds on patients infected with hiv.
the "lesion" we see is an inappropriate event of cellular immunity [technically called a "delayed-type hypersensitivity response"].
eventually, i gave it up because cortisone was so much "cleaner."
we live in the northeast and her body is always covered, at least this time of year.
my patience level with inanity is nil these days, so i find myself keeping my own company more and more out of personal choice.
as we approached hong kong, i really flared (assuming it was the peanut dust in the airplane air).
i only get them on my face.
i find that shaving my underarms and legs very lightly with an electric razor really helps as long as the skin isn't real bad.
but after 2 days of not showering, i feel like a little disgusting grease ball.
i went to an eye doctor for the surgery since my dermatologist said he didn't feel comfortable working in the delicate area of the eye.
from: shelley subject: re: molluscum gil, the molluscum info is fascinating.
then through the day, i use washcloth and more ointment for problem spots.
they just saw one trusted doctor; never even tried food elimination diets; and were offended when anyone suggested an alternative treatment.
it would be great to have lyncoln e-mail nadia directly, so they can kid-talk about their experiences.
she's allergic to dust mites and of course cat and rabbit fur.
it's a mixture of their "alpha keri" oil and tar.
so get little houdini treated and maybe he won't be stuck with the nickname for life.
i shower once a day in as cool water as possible.
for example, if a contact dermatitis arises due to, say, allergies caused by agents like eye drops or cosmetics, the irritation can provide a seeding bed for molluscum or, for that matter, for any pathogenic contaminant.
i takes the nodes' swelling as a signal that something's different that is going on in my system, and that my body is responding.
i use a grapefruit based non-soap to cleanse only the necessary areas and to wash my hair.
we wondered if there was a connection between the eczema and the loss of appetite, and he told us that babies with eczema usually don't eat well.
gil, your explanation of the immune response was really good and made sense to me in terms of what i have experienced lately.
i feel better after showering, but am dryer, especially my scalp.
i use a grapefruit based non-soap to cleanse only the necessary areas and to wash my hair.
maybe it was the placebo effect or the stress and crying i mentioned above, but skin and sinuses got better and the lymph node went way down.
just because molluscum is not the "big" issue of herpes viruses popping up in the periorbital region, does not for a moment say that it cannot or must not be a problem.
altho some antibiotics use precludes exposure to sun also.
that can be anything from frustrating people to irritating situations.
you are to be complimented as a parent who has established real sharing in the family.
but with atopic dermatitis, it's sort of like don quixote fighting the windmills.
i think it's because there's so much natural adrenaline and cortisol in my system.
if i had a penny for everyone who's had to pay dearly for infections gotten from casual-contact *bacterial* contamination, i'd be wealthy.
when so, it's probably because there (is/was) a follicular conjunctivitis that's claimed squatter's rights and become chronic -- and sometimes secretively so.
surely someone could take a look at a *known* therapeutic agent and figure out why it works...
from: kristen subject: re: re[2]: bathing wren, i've never actually documented--just recall skin problems when my psychic health was less than optimal; and nonexistent when i was happy with my life.
later i learned to touch my fingertips together one by one in a slow repetitive pattern that was hypnotic and calming.
i always felt their cautious approach kept us from finding a cure.
lowe and his group showed that coal tar has "antimitotic effects" and proposes that that might account for some of its action and effect.
one's level of anger may be commensurate with an incident; because sometimes anger is very justified.
i use cetaphil bar soap on underarms, crotch, and feet.
a mild topical corticosteroid (eg 1% hydrocortisone or maybe something a little stronger-if he needs it) and emollients can give lots of relief.
the "lesion" we see is an inappropriate event of cellular immunity [technically called a "delayed-type hypersensitivity response"].
i'm wondering if i was better able to express my sadness and pain, somehow that might lead to an overall release and possibly skin improvement.
but keeping fingernails very very short and frequent handwashing is very important to keep from tearing up the skin and preventing infection.
comments kristen, the saline nasal washes are intended to clear out secretions in the hope of preventing an infection in the sinuses.
eczema, however, in the context of its effect, can be a cause for infection insofar as its lesions can lead to a violation of skin integrity, whether that violation is primary or secondary.
i feel like ingrid bergman, who when she was told she had lung cancer, kept right on smoking to the end!
i believe the skin thing came first, and the psychic woes are a result of it.
wonder if the alpha-keri doesn't have some "additive" that is the reason for the itchiness.
we've begun to call him houdini because he is quite creative in getting his hands free (a little sense of humor goes a long way with this, no?).
perhaps a number of medical people don't really appreciate that; maybe they're accustomed to needing a staph explosion or a herpetic crisis to warrant "medical advice."
i live with my partner, who has two children, so there's daily chaos, anger, frustration, smiles, learning, growth, and love.
the dermatologist said they were harmless and need only be removed for cosmetic reasons.
i've used phisoderm for soaping, cetaphil lately, and some bar soaps that are gentle without perfumes.
counting hours now, i know it was the 48 hour post shot reaction.
when i clean out the ear canals other times, i end up with weeping and subsequent infection and then ear pain throughout.
i don't like the aimless busyness i see all around me--not much of sense behind the busyness generally.
i don't know what the polysorbates do, but the result is excellent.
over time i wore holes right through the cloth because itching was beyond my control.
it got into the grouting in the bathtub, blackened everything (towels, clothes) and took a long time to show any results.
it didn't do much for me and i must say that i was glad when i stopped using it.
then through the day, i use washcloth and more ointment for problem spots.
also, i find that it has become much harder for me to accept other people in friendships and to make friends as i have gotten older...i don't have the patience it seems for mindless discussion for discussion sake and find it hard tolerate people unless they have something to say...i believe this creates a wall to some extent, therefore making new friends becomes harder.
i itch more from too much grease than i do from dryness.
tears run down my face constantly, esp on very cold windy days.
of course, sometimes i misinterpret the feeling and that causes more problems, but basically, it's learning my own body language and forms of communication.
i 'm hoping that as my condition improves the red-brown will revert to my god-given olive white-yellow color.
professionally (and therefore personally), i do not worry about possible contact contamination such as a handshake, a kiss -- casual social gestures -- in the context of the hiv virus.
at first, i thought it was happening because i expected it to happen.
i can testify that not much happens to improve eczema once a woman hits menopause---it just means you have some more miserable symptoms to contend with.
i can't stand the gooiness of heavy oils, altho occasionally i've used small amounts of vitamin e oil i apply diprolene to my scalp immediately when after a shower when my hair is still wet--it doesn't seem to grease up my hair as much as when the hair is dry.
from: ralph subject: back to my tar obsession zetar doesn't stick to the tub in any appreciable amount.
eventually, i gave it up because cortisone was so much "cleaner."
she's allergic to dust mites and of course cat and rabbit fur.
i am going thru some real tough emotional stuff right now.
i think it is better to find ways to vent anger than bottle it up.
i also wash my hair in the shower, which then becomes a 15-20 minute job.
water seems to be good for me, on the other hand.
(when i'm feeling impoverished and using vaseline, idon't dry myself at all.)
to further the nomenclature, these "allergies" and "asthma" are examples of what two pathbreaking researchers by the names of gell and coombs termed "type i hypersensitivity" [allergen provokes antibody | provokes->tissue | provokes: effector-response such as rhinitis and asthma].
though atopic dermatitis is a disease state, the cellular immune response is exactly what we try to elicit when we test folk for tb: we want the cellular branch of the is to mount a response.
unfortunately, i cannot say the same when it comes to staph infections (there are too many to list here) and a number of other *bacterial* agents which can present problems to folks with open skin lesions.
i take soaking baths (20 to 40 mins) whenever i get that dry-all-over feeling.
at 7, our son is still small for his age, but strong and healthy, and we're very glad we had him treated.
i tried this a few times and to my surprise it really helped me feel better!
i cannot emphasize enough that it's an awful thing to do to a child.
i don't like this as much because the oil seems to be counter-productive for me, often causing additional itchiness.
what worked best for me is when i learned to tuck my hands under my butt and pretend they were paralyzed.
from: kristen subject: re: massage and telangiectasia shelley, i suspect any one who has used cortisone religiously will end up with telangiectasia, but they may not if they do faithful derm follow ups.
i always felt their cautious approach kept us from finding a cure.
to further the nomenclature, these "allergies" and "asthma" are examples of what two pathbreaking researchers by the names of gell and coombs termed "type i hypersensitivity"
venting it, and then thinking thru the reasons for it may be more beneficial, along with deciding to handle it differently.
from: kristen subject: re: bathing wren, when i was younger i never gave a second's thot to stress/emotions, but at mid-age, it has hit me like a sledge hammer that my psychic well-being or non-well-being is critical.
she also said that i probably have some blocked emotions that can be adding to my condition.
right now i'm using regular shampoo , but when scalp is bad, i use t-gel.
you are to be complimented as a parent who has established real sharing in the family.
the main reason that he's doing a houdini is because it itches.
people like me have basically normal skin; but the immune system is out of whack with the skin simply the target organ.
i tried this a few times and to my surprise it really helped me feel better!
i find it very helpful and soothing.
i'm not good at close relationships--they make me uncomfortable.
in my youth, i was highly placid and tolerant.
while we're definitely dealing with physical forces (heredity; repetitive-use stress; environmental agents -- you name it!), there are psychological forces and "tempers" that confound clinician and patient alike.
skin discoloration my daughter has eczema on her arms and legs.
since then i get them removed within 6 months, but they've never gone away by themselves.
i've never had intense itch in the ear canals, but they slough only when i'm also having scalp, face and neck eczema flares.
i think your dermatologist, however, communicated well in referring you on to an eye specialist.
but keeping fingernails very very short and frequent handwashing is very important to keep from tearing up the skin and preventing infection.
people like me have basically normal skin; but the immune system is out of whack with the skin simply the target organ.
when i went back to milk, i could no longer tolerate it at all--milk now makes so miserable i can only tolerate minute amounts periodically.
rarely get swollen glands/lymph nodes anymore.
they just saw one trusted doctor; never even tried food elimination diets; and were offended when anyone suggested an alternative treatment.
many parents view treatment of ad with steroid creams with a great deal of apprehension and suspicion but topical steroids used appropriately and judiciously, are invaluable in treating ad.
apparently the lymph nodes produce some wbcs to fight off the infection.
facts and ideas don't always match, however.
for what it's worth saliva is antimicrobial to hiv.
when i'm wet and then creamed up, i feel more "loose" with more freely moving joints--if that makes any sense.
venting it, and then thinking thru the reasons for it may be more beneficial, along with deciding to handle it differently.
it would be something clean and convenient to add to our bath water.
since i have this drat eczema virtually all over, i oil myself up several times a day, and try to shower only every other day to keep from drying out.
but don't use your best white towel with it, as it does stain to some extent.
my skin doesn't like sun anymore--it just gets mottled and burns in spots.
these are slippery slopes -- for lay people and for physicians; they're slippery for basic scientists as well: immunologists and bench scientists get confounded too.
i have to be real careful not to get into a rub-scratch-off-the-used-skin-in-grease situation while soaking.
the dermatologist said they were harmless and need only be removed for cosmetic reasons.
i limit myself to a few good friends and superficial contacts with others,
i recommend keeping the fingernails extremely short, encouraging the child to hold something in the hand at night, bite the arm or whatever's in reach, or to pinch or slap the skin lightly instead of scratching, but don't tie them down!
