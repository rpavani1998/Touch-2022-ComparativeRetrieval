as sameness and solidarity decline, so too will their political power.
as my letter indicates, i think we need something more intentional and systematic.
research shows that the online predation issue is not nearly as big as we think; the threat is overblown; we've been datelined to death; and that most kids are pretty good at navigating the web safely
the remainder of the content was delivered in a similar method as my dddm class with online discussions, wikis and other tech leadership related activities and assignments.
the workgroups create content; post that content online as they go along for review, comment, and input from others; and, over the course of a year, create several units each that add up to a complete, amazing, deep, rich online multimedia textbook.
john does a nice job of looking at k-12 and higher education and also includes a post now and then on corporate simulations, serious gaming, and the like.
as postsecondary faculty members, it behooves us to learn about it and adjust rather than dismissively rejecting the new learning landscape and stubbornly trying to stick to the status quo.
hmmm… i wonder if that means the department is going to narrow down the list of required science standards and also pare down the size of approved textbooks.
there is a ‘teaching online 101’ course plus a separate gaming module for conspiracy code.
will richardson notes: [a] school superintendent i spoke with … lamented the fact that his it staff wouldn’t give him access to youtube and even wikipedia.
better talent is the most important ingredient of better schools.
it is destined to be a profession that will no longer concentrate teachers in common geographic locations and monopoly employers – and the resulting dispersion of teachers to new locations, combined with the diversity of employers that goes along with it, cannot help but create additional layers of differentiation that affect how teachers see their own interests.
julie and andy are talking with someone new on the couch and i’m soon in the hallway, left at last to collect my thoughts.
theunited states department of education found that four years ago over a third of school districts already had students taking online courses.
this is the standard role, common across virtually all teachers, and has allowed for a pervasive sense of occupational sameness that has long been a very good thing for the unions.
and it is a fact that in a government of checks and balances they can use their power to block or weaken most reforms they do not like.
i have seen many of my own colleagues successfully transition to on-line learning.
as online courses become even more prevalent than they are now, colleges and universities either will have to get in the game or be left behind.
i hope to continue teaching courses under these various modalities: online, blended,and face to face, because they acknowledge interactions needed for effective adult learning while utilizing new technologies to allow some of those interactions to occur from a distance.
in essence, students are given an article to read on the computer that’s aligned with their reading level.
the first evaluation report on theconspiracy code is due in a couple of weeks but anecdotal evidence looks extremely promising.
in a "good" face-to-face class meeting (like the one that i led tonight), students may deeply engage in discussions with four or five other peers, and may hear other classmates share out briefly in a whole group setting.

clearly this an expensive venture from a raw dollar standpoint, at least to do it well.
the education innovation blog has an interesting post on closed v. open models of education.
over three or four years, these department-sponsored teams would create 150 to 200 textbooks for common, key courses (e.g., algebra i, physics i, ap english, united states history, 5th grade reading) that are present in nearly every school district nationwide.
i guess she prefers it when her students stay out of touch and don’t try to get their questions answered.
since postsecondary students vote with their feet and their pocketbooks, the institution does indeed have to give students online courses if that’s what they want.
i’m a little bit disoriented but gamely dive in… conspiracy code runs on a custom gaming engine designed specifically for flvs by 360ed.
and it is a fact that in a government of checks and balances they can use their power to block or weaken most reforms they do not like.
this will mean real improvement, and real benefits for the nation and its children.
as the years go by, they will have a harder time generating the solidarity they need to motivate teachers to join, to keep them as members, to mobilize supportive action - and to do the things successful unions need to do if they are to wield power in politics.
there is little to no difference in reading experience; it’s actually fairly difficult to tell at a glance at what level another student is working.
precisely because technology promises to transform the core components of schooling, it is inevitably disruptive to the jobs, routines, and resources of the people whose livelihoods derive from the existing system.
north carolina, utah, and alabama also have very robust statewide virtual schools.
a colleague of mine, wary of caving in to students’ demands for online courses, remarked recently that “students demand free beer, too; that doesn’t mean we should give it to them.”
the program accommodates spanish-speaking students (and, soon, those that speak haitian creole).
disclosure: i received no incentives from either organization (other than a thumb drive from flvs that contained the above conspiracy code materials) and was not pressured to cover them in any particular way.
nowhere does it say that the software is inadequate or that technology has dubious instructional value.

a recent survey indicated that the two main issues holding back technology use are “it doesn’t fit in the schedule,” and “there is not sufficient time to train teachers.”
[and see] the same basic pattern as for virtual schools – which is telling, as virtual schools and teacher identifiers have little to do with one another aside from their impact on union interests” (pp. 138–139).
offer teachers a vast array of occupational opportunities they didn’t have before, encourage a level of entrepeneurialism and individualism among them . . .
the author goes into detail regarding all of the problems that she had with the course, including (but not limited to): this faculty member obviously has no idea that 1, 3, and 5 are dependent on how the course and the technology were structured.

next steps for the company are to 1) create a number of specific science units, and 2) identify and/or write articles that target specific career clusters and can be aligned with theworkkeys job skill assessment program.

if elementary students spend but one hour a day learning electronically, certified staff could be reduced by a sixth.
average gains in one year for esl/ell students are 166 lexile points (compared to 27 points expected).
for example, both michigan and alabama now have state laws requiring that students have an online learning experience before they graduate.

we are in the initial stages of gathering real stories about how universal, affordable broadband can make a real difference.
it is a fact that they are more powerful – by far – than any other groups involved in the politics of education.
1a: share the story of what it could look like for kids, lots of meetings with stakeholders, showed videos/inspiring tool usage by educators, visited other places, created cognitive disconnects, built partnerships with business/industry 1b: has to be an ongoing process/conversation 2b: making videocasts, using ipod touches for teacher observation/evaluation, moved to google docs, using digital discussion forums, using blogs/wikis/etherpad, school board is now paperless 2e: working with setda or inacol, being active in the blogosphere
it cost $1.5 million to develop; costs were shared equally by flvs and 360ed and spread over three years ($250k per partner per year).
i hope that you can see the instructional power of teachers and students tapping into expert-created content delivered via the latest interactive, engaging digital technologies.

each year would see the completion of 50 textbooks.
for example, scott mcnealy, chairman of the board for sun microsystems, said last june that 'technology trumps the textbook.'
i put in much time preparing for the course and establishing expectations and norms to create a community of learners.
our research shows that even people who don't want broadband for themselves have a vague idea that it is important for kids and schools and the future of education.
imagine 50 teams, each made up of individuals who took a paid sabbatical for one year, working to create rigorous, standards-based, online textbooks that included text, graphics, electronic presentations, audio, video, simulations, learning games, interactive problem-solving and review activities, etc.
it also faces apolitical problem that, in the grander scheme of things, is more fundamental than the performance problem itself - because it prevents the performance problem from being seriously addressed and resolved. .
this is because the vast majority of educators aren't information literate themselves
many of my students commented that the depth of interaction in this online class was much greater than most of their traditional courses.

in essence, students are given an article to read on the computer that’s aligned with their reading level.
once created, these textbooks then could be hosted by the department, state departments of education, and other entities or could be downloaded for hosting on local school district servers.
those of us in educational leadership academic circles know that bruce is not afraid to take on the establishment and confront uncomfortable political and educational truths.
technological change will run into the same political roadblocks that all major reforms have run into, and for exactly the same reasons.
all flvs teachers receive extensive professional development before they’re allowed to teach.

if anything is stone-cold certain about the current structure of power, it is that technological change is destined to be resisted by the teachers unions and their allies.
it is a fact that the teachers unions have vested interests in preserving the existing educational system, regardless of how poorly it performs.
students and parents value the flexibility, accessibility, and convenience of online coursework.
i guess she prefers it when her students stay out of touch and don’t try to get their questions answered.
it's not hard to make the case that the world is now 24/7/365 anyone anytime anywhere.
however, the online forums and wikis that i utilized in the dddm class, allowed students to interact with all of their peers, not just a small group.
it might be a video phone system so that they could communicate with their grandparents who live far away.
all textbook material would be free and openly accessible to our nation’s k-12 students and educators.

this is a model that many professors use and i personally believe that it has been very effective.
i can guarantee that you’ll learn a lot and gain some valuable resources for your own work.
this allows low-level readers to still contribute to class discussions.

students who read one article a week average 102 lexile point gains; students who read two articles per week average 124.
a robust online learning infrastructure for students makes a lot of sense for the state of iowa (and i’m glad there’sa bill in the iowa house to consider it).
michael posts a lot; the comprehensiveness of information he provides is astounding.
technological change will run into the same political roadblocks that all major reforms have run into, and for exactly the same reasons.
in short, i believe i was treated much like any media representative, despite being ‘just a blogger.’
a strategic investment of monies could go a long way toward creating some pedagogically powerful, wonderfully engaging, online multimedia textbooks that then could be used by anyone in the country (or world).
there is little to no difference in reading experience; it’s actually fairly difficult to tell at a glance at what level another student is working.

all in all, it appears to be a solid attempt at integrating gaming into the education experience.
north carolina, utah, and alabama also have very robust statewide virtual schools.
textbook content would be refreshed every three or four years to ensure content relevance and usage of the latest digital technologies.

and all of this promotes solidarity, which is critical to the unions’ ability to attract members, gain their financial and emotional support, and mobilize them for economic and political ends.
however, even if online enrollments in iowa soon will number in the low thousands, the overall availability of online learning opportunities for iowa students still is extremely low.

even after investing in hardware and software, which are trivial compared to the cost of teachers, schools would have funds from staff savings to increase teacher pay and to provide more time for teacher training and planning.

however, even if online enrollments in iowa soon will number in the low thousands, the overall availability of online learning opportunities for iowa students still is extremely low.
a robust online learning infrastructure for students makes a lot of sense for the state of iowa (and i’m glad there’sa bill in the iowa house to consider it).
the business sector is behind this; they want specific policy initiatives (can isea / sai / iowa business leaders / etc.
community forums that educate the average iowan / statewide visibility initiative more online coursework options (e.g., statewide virtual high school) education of teachers / community members about workforce / 21st century skills / globallization needs/issues greater flexibility for schools to use existing funding streams repeal / revise dillon's rule?
some ‘barriers’ were put in place to ensure that students didn’t play more than work (e.g., students can’t move forward until they work on their data map, write in their journal, get feedback from their teacher, etc.).
federal provision of these textbooks would free states and school districts to spend funds on laptops, classroom-level high-speed wireless connectivity, and other technologies necessary to ensure the global competitiveness of our students in the decades to come.
going forward, learning may be far more individualized, far more in the hands (and the minds) of the learner, and far more interactive than ever before.

however, as the course progressed, i was extremely pleased with the level of dialogue and interaction that emerged among the 21 students in the class.
the profession of the future will be a much more differentiated and entrepeneurial one, and such a profession spells trouble for the unions . . .

whether it’s a statewide virtual school or some other model, we must significantly increase the number of online courses available to iowa students if we are to provide them access to the high-quality learning opportunities envisioned in theiowa core curriculum.
this constitutes a paradox: as the digital era progresses, learning may be at once more individual (contoured to a person’s own style, proclivities, and interests) yet more social (involving networking, group work, the wisdom of crowds, etc.).

otherwise, the university literally won’t have any tuition revenue because its potential students went elsewhere instead.
for example, both michigan and alabama now have state laws requiring that students have an online learning experience before they graduate.
keep giving us feedback and let us know what you think.
[t]he pervasive sameness that the unions have always counted on will slowly fall apart.
in short, i believe i was treated much like any media representative, despite being ‘just a blogger.’
it is destined to be a profession that will no longer concentrate teachers in common geographic locations and monopoly employers – and the resulting dispersion of teachers to new locations, combined with the diversity of employers that goes along with it, cannot help but create additional layers of differentiation that affect how teachers see their own interests.
while i am a huge advocate for technology, i still believe in the power of personal interaction and the synergy that can emerge from a group of people deeply engaged in group discussions and activities.
well, we will be shifting a couple of our existing blogs over to wordpress, so you’ll see some visual changes and added functionality in the next few months.
bruce writes about deep, significant school funding and/or policy issues, but does so in a way that’s accessible to those of us who aren’t experts in this area.
if the textbooks were wiki-based, much of the content could be revised and updated even before their refresh cycle came due.
when my 30 minutes with julie and andy are up, i’m swooped into that room, replaced by someone else who gets my spot on the flvs couch.
as you’ll see if you read it for a while, if it has to do with online schooling, you’ll likely find it at michael’s blog.
a colleague of mine, wary of caving in to students’ demands for online courses, remarked recently that “students demand free beer, too; that doesn’t mean we should give it to them.”
the icn is a closed, aging network and the course offerings (and monies) there, like everything else in the world, must move to the web.
it is a fact that the teachers unions have vested interests in preserving the existing educational system, regardless of how poorly it performs.
a strategic investment by the department could make an extremely powerful contribution to the k-12 educational landscape and would be a powerful lever toward ensuring that all students had access to top-quality, engaging learning materials.
the most recent data from the international association for k-12 online learning (inacol) show that only a few hundred of the 480,000 k-12 students in iowa are enrolled in online courses.
precisely because technology promises to transform the core components of schooling, it is inevitably disruptive to the jobs, routines, and resources of the people whose livelihoods derive from the existing system.
michael also maintains avirtual schooling wiki or you can follow him on twitter.
all of the most interesting stuff is being built first for consumers and is tricking back to the enterprise. . . .
they will go to the ramparts to see that technology doesnot have real transformative effects.
good results also are being seen with students with special needs (see, e.g., the arrowhead (wi) schools).
some may work with students in computer labs, handling much larger classes than today’s teachers do (because the computers are taking over much of the actual teaching).
the icn is a closed, aging network and the course offerings (and monies) there, like everything else in the world, must move to the web.
for example, if we want principals to understand the power of blogging, one good way to do that is to show them (and maybe even sign them up for) some blogs that are directly relevant and helpful to their daily work.
unfortunately,here in iowa we are not keeping pace.
the teams could be comprised as follows: four teachers plus a professor plus two programmers equals a workgroup; four workgroups per team.
teachers and students who may be thousands of miles away or from different nations or cultures.
i was somewhat trepidatious, wondering how i might engage students as meaningfully as i had within a classroom setting.
the first few teachers will train those that follow.
the first three already are available: two more reports are coming out this month and next: be sure to tap into the incredible wealth of good information on the reports, research & tools page of the setda web site [warning: it’s easy to get lost in here for hours…].
terry moe and john chubb say… there is every reason to believe that technology will only become more effective with time.
my preferred teaching mode is probably a blended approach.
julie and andy are talking with someone new on the couch and i’m soon in the hallway, left at last to collect my thoughts.
average gains in one year for esl/ell students are 166 lexile points (compared to 27 points expected).
if elementary students spend but one hour a day learning electronically, certified staff could be reduced by a sixth.
i had no idea in advance that i would end up having a notting hill horse & hound magazine-type experience (and, yes, i was hugh grant).
[t]he pervasive sameness that the unions have always counted on will slowly fall apart.
then i am offered a beverage, plunked onto a couch, handed a packet of publicity materials, and given 30 minutes to talk with julie and andy ross, vp of global services for flvs.
all are extremely similar to what other higher-level readers in the class are experiencing.
- sophisticated data systems can put the spotlight on performance [and] make progress (or the lack of it) transparent.
if we’re honest with ourselves, we will recognize that most of our school districts will never be able to provide the curricular diversity that most of our graduates need to be effective digital, global workers and citizens.
schools can be operated at lower cost, relying more on technology (which is relatively cheap) and less on labor (which is relatively expensive). . . .
expected student growth in a year is 46 lexile points.
added time for professional development, with proper supervision and accountability, would improve teacher quality.
you also cansee the live chat and/or follow the twitter conversation and/or participate in etherpad.
now that the gaming engine has been built, flvs will use it for other games/courses; i also suggested that flvs release it to students to design their own games.
for example, even though the article text and corresponding assignments are geared to students’ individual reading level, the overall layout of the article, font size, graphics, etc.
a task force stated that “teachers should provide a broader focus on scientific concepts and process in a 'big picture' sense.”
if we’re truly honest, we also will recognize that theiowa communications network (icn) is not a viable future option.
expected student growth in a year is 46 lexile points.
as sameness and solidarity decline, so too will their political power.
offer teachers a vast array of occupational opportunities they didn’t have before, encourage a level of entrepeneurialism and individualism among them . .
classes would still meet weekly
world see the flat classroom project 2006, 2007, and beyond will collected all of the work that got sent home in his two kids' friday folders for a year; the stack was 2.5 feet tall
created byintermediate district 287 in minnesota, which heads up the northern star online collaborative, the video features mike smart, 2007 minnesota teacher of the year, and a number of other minnesota educators and students.
for many school districts, online courses are the only way to provide high-level classes such as advanced placement, foreign language, advanced science or math, and other courses.
thenational repository of online courses (nroc) also is doing some interesting work but appears to be complementing, rather than replacing, print textbooks.
as always, we're interested in your nominations for interviewees.
even after investing in hardware and software, which are trivial compared to the cost of teachers, schools would have funds from staff savings to increase teacher pay and to provide more time for teacher training and planning.
disclosure: i received no incentives from either organization (other than a thumb drive from flvs that contained the above conspiracy code materials) and was not pressured to cover them in any particular way.
for $200 million per year, the department could create phenomenal, mind-blowing online multimedia textbooks that could be used by students all across the country.
the profession of the future will be a much more differentiated and entrepeneurial one, and such a profession spells trouble for the unions . . .
powerful groups will try to block it.
michael also maintains avirtual schooling wiki or you can follow him on twitter.
and the most powerful groups in that process are special interests, led by the teachers unions, with a stake in keeping the system as it is. . . .
they dip in and out of the gaming engine throughout the year, assembling clues and completing missions.
information and knowledge are absolutely fundamental to what education is all about . . .
all reports of the week will be listed under the reading category (and, in most instances, theresearch and evaluation category).
it is a fact that they are more powerful – by far – than any other groups involved in the politics of education.
we now can live stream video from our phones; imagine a world in 5 years where everyone's phone is iphonish justin bieber became famous by uploading his talent show videos to the web check out surfthechannel.com today, instead of writing a letter to the editor / better business bureau / ceo,you make a video business is different today because people can form groups, allstate (and others) has hired people to monitor the twittersphere; don't call; tweet!
students can have more interaction with . . .
added pay would help attract and retain better talent.
some may oversee or serve as mentors to the front-line teachers themselves.
john does a nice job of looking at k-12 and higher education and also includes a post now and then on corporate simulations, serious gaming, and the like.
unfortunately,here in iowa we are not keeping pace.
this 12-year-old kid can throw out a question to 1.7 billion people shirky: we are experiencing a tectonic shift in how we form groups and self-organize wesch: this is not simply a technological revolution, this is a cultural revolution.
similarly, four days ago steve jobs, ceo of apple, noted that textbooks as we know them will disappear.
- education can be freed from geographic constraint.
i am sending this letter to encourage the department to make a relatively small, but extremely strategic, investment that would pay enormous dividends for our nation’s elementary and secondary students.
to be honest, the two most visible free online textbook initiatives still have a long way to go.
i am very interested in the challenge of articulating the vision as well.
most students spend about an hour a day working for the class, some of which is in the game environment.
meta-analyses of existing research show that student achievement in face-to-face and online courses is approximately equivalent.

teachers can be freed from their tradition-bound classroom roles, employed in more differentiated and productive ways, and offered new career paths.
it also has a far-reaching capacity tochange politics - and to eat away, relentlessly and effectively, at the political barriers that have long prevented reform.
i think you would take a look at much of what we do in our current schooling system and just toss it and essentially start over.
high schools, with three hours of usage, could reduce staff by up to a half.
there is some really important information and thinking coming out of all three of these channels.
as big as the numbers are, the return on this strategic investment would be huge.

[and see] the same basic pattern as for virtual schools – which is telling, as virtual schools and teacher identifiers have little to do with one another aside from their impact on union interests” (pp. 138–139).
- students can have more interaction with . . .
other districts are finding that online coursework can be an excellent option for at-risk students or credit recovery; for homebound, incarcerated, or home-schooled students; or for meeting the needs of students who simply may not be successful in a more traditional classroom environment.
if anything is stone-cold certain about the current structure of power, it is that technological change is destined to be resisted by the teachers unions and their allies.
[t]he idea is to minimize all sources of differentiation, because they undermine the common interests and solidarity that so contribute to union success. . . .

this week's report is from education sector: here's a quote from the report: there has been no shortage of solutions for improving the nation’s public schools.
this level of computer usage is quite feasible given instructional technology that exists today.
since postsecondary students vote with their feet and their pocketbooks, the institution does indeed have to give students online courses if that’s what they want.
all are extremely similar to what other higher-level readers in the class are experiencing.
this faculty member obviously has no idea that 1, 3, and 5 are dependent on how the course and the technology were structured.
i think i can make the first two and would do the third one too if my son didn’t have baseball practice.
the student reading at first-grade level also is reading the same content as her peer at the ninth-grade level.
this level of computer usage is quite feasible given instructional technology that exists today.
conspiracy code is designed to be an integrated, full-year course / gaming experience.
some may work with students online but still do it in real time.
i think you would take a look at much of what we do in our current schooling system and just toss it and essentially start over.
what her academic colleague somehow, incredibly, fails to realize, of course, is thatstudents don’t have to attend his institution .
the author goes into detail regarding all of the problems that she had with the course, including (but not limited to): there was a ‘lack of immediacy’ in communication; she was ‘only able to introduce students to a limited amount of material outside of the textbook readings;’ it is ‘simply impossible to replicate a lecture online;’ there wasn’t ‘enough time or a proper forum’ to help students ‘develop writing and critical thinking skills or to foster original ideas;’ online courses are too big; she had no time off during the week like she would with a regular 3–hour, once-a-week, face-to-face class; she got too many e-mail messages from students; and she suspected her students didn’t like her very much.
each team receives ongoing feedback from a representative from an appropriate national organization (e.g., national council of teachers of mathematics, national council for social studies), has an assistive technology expert to ensure content accessibility by students with disabilities, and has a project manager to keep the workgroups moving along.
[t]eachers unions are steadfast in demanding sameness . . .
and all of this promotes solidarity, which is critical to the unions’ ability to attract members, gain their financial and emotional support, and mobilize them for economic and political ends.
the student reading at first-grade level also is reading the same content as her peer at the ninth-grade level.
teachers and students who may be thousands of miles away or from different nations or cultures.
i can guarantee that you’ll learn a lot and gain some valuable resources for your own work.
to recognize as much is not to launch ideological attacks against the unions.
if we’re truly honest, we also will recognize that theiowa communications network (icn) is not a viable future option.
- teachers can be freed from their tradition-bound classroom roles, employed in more differentiated and productive ways, and offered new career paths.
theunited states department of education found that four years ago over a third of school districts already had students taking online courses.
there aren't enough educators / policymakers that are looking at the current system of schooling and saying "oh, crap!
