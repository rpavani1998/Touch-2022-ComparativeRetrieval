not to say we won't get to see and do things we as adults will love, but we will definitely have things planned out much better!
not all of us had a snack every day so by the end of our trip we had all sorts of credits left over for snacks.
in front of splash mountain, there's a opening you can see them clearly - tomorrowland.... on the bridge... - walkway between the central hub in front of the castle and tomorrowland - the rose garden if you can get there - on one of the benches by the riverboat on the rivers of america - bridge from the central hub to tomorrow land - from the gallows at liberty square - on main street, but not at the hub; further up the street by the ice cream parlor.
he gives this unique introduction for that night's episode.
- utilizing online check-in will not get your room ready any faster than normal processes.
we will definitely tour world showcase this trip, even if we only pass through each country, we will see all of them.
i figure it deserves another chance before i definitely turn my nose up at it.
i especially love when they open the doors to the building and you can see the park for a brief moment as you're falling and screaming!
however, probably due to laziness, when we booked this year's vacation i did include the dining plan.
the resort will receive your package and hold it for you.
weather permitting, the hours of operation are: sunday: 10:30 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.
the drive down was uneventful.
not all of us had a snack every day so by the end of our trip we had all sorts of credits left over for snacks.
we could book 2 rooms at the polynesian, but the 2 rooms would equal close to over $800 a night anyway, so that is out!
since we're driving we don't need to be so concerned about packing but the garden grocer may come in good use, for diapers and such.
an example would be the california grill at the contemporary.

looks like we won't be able to experience this attraction as wyatt is only 2 - but maybe next year!
i thought lunch would be a good time, so we have reservations at noon.
we did, however, get to watch wishes from out resort, the polynesian - right there on the beach - and that was fantastic!
this time, we already have it set in our minds, this trip is all about the kids.
in the end, it really depends on you and who you're vacationing with.
avoid the stress and hassle of taking all that stuff with you - don't forget about the luggage fees now too!
so far, what we have planned for our trip seems like enough but we may take some time to visit other resorts so we can get an idea of where we'd like to stay next year!

we booked our vacation with aaa - my travel agent's name is travis flexer and he is wonderful.
the plan also includes one refillable drink mug per person.
checking in online is simple.
suddenly the lights in the library turn back on, a door opens and you enter the "twilight zone."
of course there are bigger rooms st the polynesian, for $900+ a night which is definitely not in our budget!
try to stand where in the first row after the street path the cast members tape off that way people's heads aren't directly in front of you
we took the boat launch back to the polynesian and got to see wishes from the boat!
basically, i did all the planning and i was trying to find things that would keep everyone happy.
platinum dining plan this package includes everything in the premium package plus: personalized pre-arrival itinerary planning; a fireworks cruise; private in-room babysitting; nightly turn down service; a spa treatment; and a disney photopass cd.

staying off property in a rental house, while cost effective, is not something i'd want to do.
i figure it deserves another chance before i definitely turn my nose up at it.
yes, you will pay to ship the package but it's worth it to avoid the stress and hassle of taking all that stuff with you - don't forget about the luggage fees now too!

the park was empty, we got right on rides.
the plan also includes one refill¬able drink mug per person.

we will definitely tour world showcase this trip, even if we only pass through each country, we will see all of them.
it's also a loud and crowded resort, of course - it's cheap.
my first choice is the newbay lake tower villas because, well, they are new and the are right by the monorail - i love being near disney's monorail transportation!
this means you may not get to see and do everything thatyou hope to but believe me, that is much better to deal with than unhappy children!
epcot rides and attractions we want to experience at the magic kingdom: big thunder mountain railroad buzz lightyear's space ranger spin ariel's grotto these are on our 'must see' list for this year.
from the monorail as it circles the seven seas lagoon.
with that being said, breakfast is usually the cheapest meal of the day so when we use the dining plan and schedule a lot of breakfasts, we aren'treally getting our money's worth.
in addition to these dining options, this plan also provides the following entertainment opportunities: preferred fireworks viewing for wishes and illuminations; unlimited golf, boat rental, fishing excursions; admission to cirque du soleil’s show, la nouba; access to disney children’s activities centers; admission to a number of disney’s theme park tours.
this saves you from having to pack all kinds of extra diapers, water, snacks for the kids, etc.
this ride is a free fall type ride but that isn't even half of the reason why i love it!
beach towels take up too much room if you try to pack them!

quick service dining plan the disney quick service dining plan is the newest plan and includes two quick service meals and two snacks per person, per night of your package stay for everyone in the party ages 3 and over.
this is also great for those who have special diet needs!
the 2009 dining plan last year we got the basic plan and to be honest, i think it was waste.
on my family's last trip, we didn't keep the kids in mind as well as we should have.
the view by the tori gate is great between norway and china there is a cast member entrance set back a ways from the walkway.
kids become very tired swimming even for only an hour.
the doors close and the elevator heads up.
regular rooms start at around $82/night.
please, mark any article you find interesting and wish to share with the community, even if it’s been marked already.
despite the current h1n1 flu concern, things are calm and *normal* here.
what is included is a soft drink and dessert and this is great if you don't want wine, beer or a mixed drink with your dinnerand you usually order dessert.
the chefs cook at the table and entertain as they cook.
this year, the price is $12.49 and once purchased you can get free refills at identified soft drink locationsat your resort for the length of your stay.
in my experience, this is the maximum amount of people for most rooms at any of the disney resorts.
epcot has kidcot - these fun stops are "kid stations" located in several future world pavilions and in all of the world showcase countries.
this year i want to be prepared, so i did a search to find the best places to watch the fireworks and here's what i found: magic kingdom from the dumbo ride....preferably on dumbo outside the plaza restaurant
this means you may not get to see and do everything thatyou hope to but believe me, that is much better to deal with than unhappy children!
no, we're not there yet but disney allows resort guests to check in up to 10 days prior to their arrival date!
any later than that and kids may be over tired and overstimulated from the day's events.
this package entitles you to one bottle of wine per night, redeemable at table service restaurants during your stay.
the chefs cook at the table and entertain as they cook.
so, what happened with us last trip was that every meal we were still paying for something, a child's meal, an appetizer, a drink and/or the gratuity so it didn't really feel as though we were getting a deal.
- decide which rides and attractions you want to see before you go - this is another obvious one but so many people, including us on our last last trip, get to a park and then stand there looking at the park map, trying to decide where to go first.
and that took up 2 table service credits.
this ride is a free fall type ride but that isn't even half of the reason why i love it!
each guest on the disney premium plan receives one table service breakfast, lunch and dinner and two snacks per day.

we took the boat launch back to the polynesian and got to see wishes from the boat!
what is included is a soft drink and dessert and this is great if you don't want wine, beer or a mixed drink with your dinnerand you usually order dessert.
decide which rides and attractions you want to see before you go - this is another obvious one but so many people, including us on our last last trip, get to a park and then stand there looking at the park map, trying to decide where to go first.
for a two-bedroom villa with a standard view of the savanna there is an additional adult charge of $25 per adult per night for more than 2 adults - this villa is $700/night!
the kids are usually the best behaved at breakfast because it's the start of the day and breakfast food is pretty ordinary so even my pickiest eater loves it.
the kids are usually in good spirits because it's the beginning of the day.
any later than that and kids may be over tired and overstimulated from the day's events.
first stop, the doors open and you see a very cool optical illusion.
if you have children under the age of 3 they can share a meal with someone or you can order them their own but again, you pay out of pocket for that meal.
if part of your rest time includes relaxing by a resort pool, be prepared to have nap time after that!
this wastes time (duh) and the kids may be overly anxious to go and see/do things!
- refillable drink mug –is available, for cash, from each disney world resort.
it's also a loud and crowded resort, of course - it's cheap.
with that being said, breakfast is usually the cheapest meal of the day so when we use the dining plan and schedule a lot of breakfasts, we aren'treally getting our money's worth.
it didn't work out so great.
this service began this year and so we haven't used it until now.
diapers, clothing, bathroom stuff, bathing suits, towels, etc.. here is what i was going to do and if you are flying and feel overwhelmed with packing, this may help: - pool gear - only pack suits - forget beach towels.
the resorts have a little shed by the pool that has towels in it.
so, what happened with us last trip was that every meal we were still paying for something, a child's meal, an appetizer, a drink and/or the gratuity so it didn't really feel as though we were getting a deal.
dining plan the disney dining plan includes one quick service meal, one snack, and one table service meal per person, per night of your package stay for everyone in the party ages 3 and over.
kids become very tired swimming even for only an hour.
finally, one last option is the family suites at disney's all star music which is a value resort.
this ride is exhilirating from beginning to end...and a bit spooky!
the entire experience is exciting, from the moment you step into the hotel lobby - everything is covered by dust and cobwebs.
we could book 2 rooms at the polynesian, but the 2 rooms would equal close to over $800 a night anyway, so that is out!
he gives this unique introduction for that night's episode.
we never got to see illuminations, we never got to hollywood studios so we didn't see fireworks there
we booked our vacation with aaa - my travel agent's name is travis flexer and he is wonderful.
well, first of all, the location.
my bff and her family are staying there this may - i am interested in hearing how they like this resort.
