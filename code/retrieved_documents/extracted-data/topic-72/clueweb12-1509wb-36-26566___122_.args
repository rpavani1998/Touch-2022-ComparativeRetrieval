many parents view treatment of ad with steroid creams with a great deal of apprehension and suspicion but topical steroids used appropriately and judiciously, are invaluable in treating ad.if an "antimitotic" agent can slow down this process, it is conceivable that it can provide some benefit.eczema, however, in the context of its effect, can be a cause for infection insofar as its lesions can lead to a violation of skin integrity, whether that violation is primary or secondary.we adults sometimes underestimate kids' intelligence--they know a lot of things at gut level whether adults spell it out for them or not.at 7, our son is still small for his age, but strong and healthy, and we're very glad we had him treated.in point of fact and in point of frequency: type i and type iv hypersensitivity reactions usually belong as symptoms within the same set of individuals.i hope that i'm not being too outspoken but i've seen too many children (and indirectly, their parents) suffer unneccessarily from this attitude (which basically arises from ignorance).also, i find that it has become much harder for me to accept other people in friendships and to make friends as i have gotten older...i don't have the patience it seems for mindless discussion for discussion sake and find it hard tolerate people unless they have something to say...i believe this creates a wall to some extent, therefore making new friends becomes harder.but keeping fingernails very very short and frequent handwashing is very important to keep from tearing up the skin and preventing infection.while we're definitely dealing with physical forces (heredity; repetitive-use stress; environmental agents -- you name it!), there are psychological forces and "tempers" that confound clinician and patient alike.effect comes into play, we'll need to be clear about what we "know" and what we experience; signs and symptoms are not identical with disease entity -- yet they are "inextricably" bound up with evidentiary causation.many infants with atopic dermatitis are clear of it by their second birthday but to wait a year and a half would be a little unfair to the child.tylenol for kids might help take the edge off your child's nerves--i used to take heavy duty transquilizers--a mere palliative but it makes one so dopey and lethargic.as a health officer in the field of infectious disease i engage in both clinical and research areas of immuno(in)competence and, especially, aids.of course, sometimes i misinterpret the feeling and that causes more problems, but basically, it's learning my own body language and forms of communication.
