to test this hypothesis, i conducted a simple statistical test with data from my social theory class (n=73).
the undergraduate curriculum is based on a “core” that covers classic writings.
though, i have seen several people not get tenure somewhere, move to a “higher-ranked” school and then get tenure shortly thereafter.
instead, they get this frankenstein major that requires some math, some philosophy, analytical/deductive thinking, and clear writing.
so the whiz kid math majors who do the mental heavy lifting have to share credit (and paychecks) with the legacy kids.
data from 1,753 independent samples were included in the meta-analysis, yielding 6,589 correlations for 8 different criteria and 82,659 graduate students.
as a quick side comment – what is very cool about northwestern is that everything seems to scream “inter-disciplinarity” of some sort.
yes, being on the opposite side of things can be tough, but the evidence shows that conservatives, on the average, aren’t even trying to make careers in the academy.
today it’s not just classroom instruction that creates so much cultural and social capital in childhood.
and surprise, the evidence points toward self-selection.
recruiters from elite law, consulting, and investment banks exclusively focus on about three or four elite colleges.
(b) they simply don’t understand that their kids won’t make the income to cover the loan.

i’m a realist because there’s too much evidence against a fundamentalist position.
well, the empirical record shows that the public isn’t terribly interested in this record.
the reason that prices have to eventually go down is that the underlying value hasn’t risen.
it’s not the other way around – large grad students do not lead to more majors.
the key to understanding the chicago experience is that it is based on purely intellectual pursuits.
if they are willing to do it again, they’re probably good workers.
human capital simply can’t be transferred.
that can backfire, as some students need dissertation projects that are modest.
if i were to advise foreign applicants, i’d insist that they show that they “get it” (i.e., understand academia) and have a credible signal of commitment to academia.
the endowment would be earmarked for low income in-state students and the university would be required to admit a certain proportion of in state students.
iu has great students.
but not everyone has the academic ability or desire for the professional tracks (business, education, health) or the sciences/engineering.
it’s not a problem if *some* people major in fields with poor job prospects.
they often have extensive experience with the applicant, or they can explain why the performance in one course is remarkable.
one might interpret this post as a complaint against the buffet style sociology major, where students just take a bunch of disconnected courses.
becker’s argument was that education resulted in higher income because schools trained people in various skills and thus create human capital.
for example, i have read many letters that insisted the student was top notch (top 1% or 5%), yet the gre’s and gpa were clearly atrocious.
basically, if you have a resume, writing sample, and time to interview, how would identify people who are bright, hard working, can finish tasks in a timely manner, have a good nose for research, etc?
i have also argued that it may not be wise for everyone to go to college considering the astronomical cost.

mathematical sociology/computational models intro game theory breadth: a few courses in qualitative topics; three courses of topics in sociology (like race, gender, education, etc.); a capstone course the background that a student would need is about 1 year of calculus and some computer literacy.
for this story to work, you need to believe that these services – investment banking, consulting – can be easily taught to people who aren’t geniuses.
the 1% of letters:  still, every once in a while, there’s a letter that makes a clear and compelling case for a student.
even if mixed classes lead to more gender mixing, teachers may still preferentially treat males.
it shows that we are encouraging people to attend college but they are not earning degrees that will make them competitive in the labor market.
that allows the system of hiring by college to survive.

early-on, i tried to get my io friends interested in the issues that so animated my own research.
the profile of the letter writer is that they are an active teacher and researcher.
they’ve succeeded in teaching and research, but they’ve failed in maintaining their relationship to the state.
the conservative critics are also correct in that many branches of the humanities have taken a very liberal turn in the last fifty years.
thus, they simply lack the general language of social science.
students take intro or social problems, then topics, and then a little stats and theory.
the introductory sociology course is hard because there is no standard and you get a wide range of students, from scared freshmen to apathetic sixth year seniors.
colleges are filled with people who are there because they think it will lead to jobs.
among sociology courses, it’s probably the most demanding course, along with statistics and intro.

we reject the overwhelming majority of applicants, including many who will go on and have great careers in sociology.
but they had significantly higher test scores in the year before admission than girls who applied but were not admitted, although admission was reported to be a lottery, and their subsequent achievement was no better than that of students in a coeducational program with similar entry-level score.
in my large lecture in social theory, about 10% got any version of an a, with a single unadorned a. i am not alone.
rather, it’s a truly intellectual place.
as surveys have shown, professors tend to be politically liberal, much more than the rest of the population.
second, the public research school has done a good job educating lots of people,myself included.
that b-school training was truly awesome.
we know that many students fail out of college and those that remain fail to learn much.
the folks with rock bottom gre’s and a 2.9 gpa won’t get more than a quick glance, if that.
while there are likely some cases of that, the evidence was always weak for discrimination as a general explanation.
that brings 2-4 people a semester.
back then, course readings were 30-40 academic journal articles.
except for math soc, all the courses are there already.
if you are applying to iu, i am quite sorry.
on the other hand, the debt students incur as they pursue a liberal arts education also poses a threat to free inquiry, that central value of democratic society.

and: in addition, underperforming children in ss schools often transfer out prematurely, which inflates final performance outcomes.
i’m in touch with some of our graduates and structure is a matter that they constantly wrestle with.
this report is about minimum standards.
the knee jerk reaction to proposal to limit or shrink college education is a symptom.
the result is that you get people who are exposed to theory as the last thing they do before graduation.
the undergrad coordinator also knows i need people.

they’ve done at reasonable price (until recently) and with a world class faculty.

in particular, they make a living by both creating competitive kid capitaland sustaining a base of families who believe that kid capital is essential to future success.
it turns out that there is actually extensive research investigating whether gre scores actually do predict performance in graduate school.
but this chart shows that there is a significant number of people who can handle college, but it likely won’t help them much.
as i wrote a few weeks ago, the leading state schools aren’t really “state” schools.
these people take out massive loans for skills they will never use.
i don’t count it against students, but it doesn’t help.
in exchange for adopting a quasi-private stance and retaining these privileges, state universities would be required to fund raise and establish an endowment that is only for in-state students.
if you are the kind of person who can follow the rules, you’ll probably do well.
(d) consumption good – they simply value the four years a lot.
i bet a few hard science types would be happy to tack it on as a double major.
furthermore, graduate schools in law and medicine don’t give you credit for a low gpa just because it was in a hard major.
from internal data, i know sociology gives lower grades than the rest of the college of arts and sciences, which gives lower grades than the rest of the university.

becker’s argument was that education resulted in higher income because schools trained people in various skills and thus create human capital.

that way, the state university could be free from state regulations while maintaining its mission to serve the local population.
instead, i would like to see some sort of cost-benefit analysis added to the way that we charge people for education.
we reject the overwhelming majority of applicants, including many who will go on and have great careers in sociology.
for example, there was a booth for a company that sold the paint used to paint the lines on soccer fields.
we should think of those who run organizations related to children’s afterschool activities as entrepreneurs (note that they are usually part of the formal economy, but can be part of the informal economy as well).
i was particularly struck by this when i attended a state soccer expo and saw vendors selling products i had not previously considered vital to the travel soccer enterprise.

the reason that prices have to eventually go down is that the underlying value hasn’t risen.
i’ve seen a lot of letters by bosses, academic advisers, project supervisors, and so forth.
on the one hand, as many have pointed out, rising costs limit access.
my sense is that there’s a large opportunity that’s been passed on.
with respect to the debate we had about useless college majors, the main point is that dance is probably like many fields in that it is very hard to continue after graduation.
but producers, who need to make money, advertise that the products will make participation more convenient, or improve a child’s performance, thus making a purchase “required.”
the second part of the course will be the traditional social science approach to movements (e.g. theories of grievances, recruitment, etc.).
but the difference is that there’s no ponzi scheme since you can’t sell or transfer your college degree to someone else for an even higher price.
furthermore, lower division topics courses (e.g., crime or gender) rarely cast their topic in terms of general sociological arguments.
the authors,diane halpern of claremont and seven others, claim higher scores for ss students are results of selection bias and sample censoring: for example, students at a public middle school in the southwest united states boast higher test scores than most students in their district.
similarly, modern college students are more interested in financial stability, not philosophical issues.

as long as dance education is inexpensive, that’s not such a big deal.

though the cloud might obviate that i’ll probably be using prezi in some settings (btw: you can explore prezi presentations here).
as students, we knew we were there to learn the latest-and-greatest academic thinking.
in particular, they make a living by both creating competitive kid capitaland sustaining a base of families who believe that kid capital is essential to future success.
first, there is little variance among letter writers.
also, it’s hard to get experimental evidence but there is observational evidence.
sociology for example, studies all kinds of deviant behavior and the faculty tend to skew liberal, not the sort of thing that attracts conservatives.
as surveys have shown, professors tend to be politically liberal, much more than the rest of the population.
many students lack the ability or maturity to complete college.
for a certain segment of the market, there is a huge over investment in human capital.
so people go to college to avoid service sector and manual work.
well, the empirical record shows that the public isn’t terribly interested in this record.
while people don’t intentionally teach bad, they do in practice because there is no reason to do otherwise.
if the tool fails to do its job, i can live without it.
i’d focus on faculty funding formulas.
in the social science and humanities, funding is mainly internal.
they also do their best to arrest the small fraction of violent protesters.
thus, they simply lack the general language of social science.
yes, being on the opposite side of things can be tough, but the evidence shows that conservatives, on the average, aren’t even trying to make careers in the academy.
the stuff you learned can’t be transferred to another person, no matter how much they pay.
for example: so totalitarian is the contemporary university that professors have written to rollins complaining that his courses are too canonical in content and do not include enough of the requisite “silenced” voices.
human capital simply can’t be transferred.
we - the higher education community – should instead work on identifying promising young people from less wealthy families and building financial resources, like endowments and grants, that will make college affordable for these people.
nuclear engineering, which has very high unemployment, reflects a shrinking industry.
in 1971, about 50% went to college to make money.
class skipping is associated with a 10.1% grade drop.
the profile of the letter writer is that they are an active teacher and researcher.
after all, novelists, artists, and other creative types improve the world in important ways.
rather, it’s a truly intellectual place.
(d) consumption good – they simply value the four years a lot.
we need to raise the reading level of majors and send a consistent message that sociology is not a bunch of topics, it’s a school of thought that isn’t different from any other science that compares theory with data.
furthermore, there’s evidence that college is overpriced relative to future earnings.
about 30% of our grades are a’s, making us the 10th toughest grader in the university.

the knee jerk reaction to proposal to limit or shrink college education is a symptom.
human capital is the skill that someone has that allows them to gain income from the market.
a lot of our star students, who go on to dominate the job market, were high performers at relatively low status schools.
according to the aclu, they then violated procedure by not releasing us immediately after issuing the misdemeanor citations.

the typical intro course often relies on streamlined textbooks.
my old micro prof, sam peltzman, took me to dinner.
unless ss education had unambiguously strong effects, we should probably not be doing it.
the way it rubs off on graduate students, for better or worse, is that phd students are allowed to think big, be ambitious.
to test this hypothesis, i conducted a simple statistical test with data from my social theory class (n=73).
they’ve done at reasonable price (until recently) and with a world class faculty.
first, many students are attracted to the topics of sociology (e.g., race) not the general idea of testing social theories.
for example, i have read many letters that insisted the student was top notch (top 1% or 5%), yet the gre’s and gpa were clearly atrocious.
so, i specialized in finance (what else?) and launched into an exciting decade+ of business practice.
sociology for example, studies all kinds of deviant behavior and the faculty tend to skew liberal, not the sort of thing that attracts conservatives.
we should think of those who run organizations related to children’s afterschool activities as entrepreneurs (note that they are usually part of the formal economy, but can be part of the informal economy as well).
the implied message is that this course is hard and not terribly relevant.
profits are high because prices are high; teachers and coaches can charge a lot since there are often not many competitors in their areas of expertise, which would help keep prices down.
i’ve heard that they’ve reformed graduate student financial support, which is welcome.
first, departments vary in their strategies and procedures.
i.e., asian american college students build lots of study groups that others don’t.
i’d be surprised if the engineering professor knew the politics of the new guy from kazakhstan, unless he made a big deal out of it.
up to speed and 10 years ahead of practice in a few sittings.

the place just exudes this atmosphere that is really hard to find at other schools, even other top notch universities.
students only approach profs who like them and who have given them good grades.

unless an institution is engaged in fraud, there’s little reason to pick specifically on for-profit institutions.
scholarly productivity can be evident early on, so a short clock perhaps makes sense.
i then merged attendance, assignment completion, and midterm performance data.
a couple times i have also used the hofstede cultural relativity of organizational practices piece.
as a higher education researcher, i am familiar with the evidence addressing under-represented minorities and their achievement.
but huge college debt makes that choice hard to sustain.

it shows that we are encouraging people to attend college but they are not earning degrees that will make them competitive in the labor market.
most sociology programs requires one semester of statistics, which can’t be faked.
one commenter noted that sociology might just be graded harder.
the undergraduate curriculum is based on a “core” that covers classic writings.
another sold special headbands meant to help prevent concussions.
it shows that the growth in awarded college degrees has come from people majoring outside the sciences and engineering.
evidence about sex typing doesn’t address teacher interaction.
update: hadn’t been there for some time but just noted that the teachomt wiki has some nice org design related materials (and, hey, their design looks very familiar).
they know profs are looking for hard working people who need boring work done.
i collected two behavioral/discipline variables: did the students show up to two randomly selected classes and did students use their “free pass,” which allows them to skip a daily writing assignment.
having taken a math major myself, i can attest that topology isn’t useful in the labor market, but it probably acts as strong signal.
but the difference is that there’s no ponzi scheme since you can’t sell or transfer your college degree to someone else for an even higher price.
notably, the funeral industry and some industries associated with children (like preschool) are regulated in an attempt to limit exploitation of a vulnerable population.
people (including banks) started believing that housing prices would just go up and up, which then justified all kinds of crazy loans.
notably, the funeral industry and some industries associated with children (like preschool) are regulated in an attempt to limit exploitation of a vulnerable population.
the abstract: this meta-analysis examined the validity of the graduate record examinations (gre) and undergraduate grade point average (ugpa) as predictors of graduate school performance.
so we don’t rely on a steady feed of polished applicants from the west coast and ivy league.
i felt sorry (for him) that i couldn’t bring him around in that discussion.
higher education is second fiddle.
long time readers know that i believe that we have too much college.
but not everyone has the academic ability or desire for the professional tracks (business, education, health) or the sciences/engineering.
the profile is that they major in sociology and have a decent gpa.
so they need something, which turns out to be these other areas.
according to the aclu, they then violated procedure by not releasing us immediately after issuing the misdemeanor citations.
as long as dance education is inexpensive, that’s not such a big deal.
for example, there was a booth for a company that sold the paint used to paint the lines on soccer fields.
perhaps a “free” wisconsin would charge harvard rates.
if they do it well, they move on to more ambitious things.
most sociology majors could earn more money, but they insist on service oriented jobs, like teaching and social work, that suprress their wages.
the state has the power to charter schools, give them grants, and license their brand name (e.g., the university of state x).
but i still want people to read a good “here’s the facts” summary for each case.
but they had significantly higher test scores in the year before admission than girls who applied but were not admitted, although admission was reported to be a lottery, and their subsequent achievement was no better than that of students in a coeducational program with similar entry-level score.
for example, policy makers in america often promote more student loans to increase enrollments.
typically, 3 minutes into describing something i was working on to a respected io colleague, i could see the eyes glaze over and hear the responses go on autopilot.
they spend their whole career in topics courses that do not emphasize the basics of theory, the casting empirical topics as evidence for broader concepts.
i’d be surprised if the engineering professor knew the politics of the new guy from kazakhstan, unless he made a big deal out of it.
second, i didn’t see evidence showing that teachers treat female students better in mixed classes.
with her permission, valerie from new hampshire wrote the following: i’m a reader of orgtheory and i enjoy the grad school rulz stuff from your blog (i love professional development type things).
as students, we knew we were there to learn the latest-and-greatest academic thinking.
i wanted to express my concern about the double threat posed to the ideal of liberal education by the rising cost of tuition and, more generally, the burden of debt.
the out-of-school hours are a huge source of capital-building as well (what i call “competitive kid capital” in my work on elementary school-age kids involved in the competitive afterschool activities of chess, dance, and soccer).
sure, in polls, people may talk about the importance of education, but in state budgets, the message is clear.

the major alternative is that school is a de facto iq test.
a research group at georgetown has analyzed this data to show correlations between college major and income.
among the social sciences, econ is on top ($70k) while soc is at the bottom ($45k).
written by teppo november 9, 2011 at 8:33 pm posted in academia, education, productivity and performance with 14 comments last week, i linked to data showing that the growth degrees awarded has often come from non-vocational areas (nva), such as the humanities.
as a quick side comment – what is very cool about northwestern is that everything seems to scream “inter-disciplinarity” of some sort.
and these afterschool hours are not only the source of capital for kids, they are also the source of very real economic capital for many adults.
they’ve succeeded in teaching and research, but they’ve failed in maintaining their relationship to the state.
but this chart shows that there is a significant number of people who can handle college, but it likely won’t help them much.
that’s why it’s good to consult with colleagues from those nations  if there’s a candidate who might be a good fit.
while some parents express discomfort that some adults are “making a living off of” their children (childhood is supposed to be a sacred time, after all), they still pay up for fear of their child being “left behind.”
the classic agency v structure (or, actor v non-actor) debate was a good fit for the seminar.
we want to tell apple how to make more profit.
on the one hand, as many have pointed out, rising costs limit access.
halpern at al claim, correctly, that separating students prevent students from cooperating and increases sex typing (e.g., girls act more feminine).
overall, i am still not a strong proponent of single sex, or single race, education.
the result is that you get people who are exposed to theory as the last thing they do before graduation.
i was particularly struck by this when i attended a state soccer expo and saw vendors selling products i had not previously considered vital to the travel soccer enterprise.
instead, i would like to see some sort of cost-benefit analysis added to the way that we charge people for education.
and: in addition, underperforming children in ss schools often transfer out prematurely, which inflates final performance outcomes.
in the ols model with dummies for attendance on either day and skipping 1, 2, 3 and 4 (or more), the results are the same.
the implied message is that this course is hard and not terribly relevant.
we picked a set of readings that sounded fun and interesting (some classics as well as recent stuff).
we need a way for people to credential themselves without taking on the massive un-payable debt associated with the modern humanities degree.

there’s a lot of higher education that won’t get you a job – arts, philosophy, and do so forth.
physical capital is some physical object that allows you to produce more goods and services for sale on the market.
(i exchanged emails with chuck – he has a mere 33,000 people signed up for the class so far.)
after all, novelists, artists, and other creative types improve the world in important ways.

that way, the state university could be free from state regulations while maintaining its mission to serve the local population.
i was somewhat surprised when he, in so many words, told me i was full of it.
first, many students are attracted to the topics of sociology (e.g., race) not the general idea of testing social theories.
the theory explains the liberalism of the american professoriate as a function of reputation-based self-selection: because academia has a reputation for liberalism, liberals are more likely to pursue graduate degrees and academic careers.
as one commenter noted, departments are scared of losing students.
i’m dealing with young folks who won’t have a lot of first hand knowledge of movements.
update: hadn’t been there for some time but just noted that the teachomt wiki has some nice org design related materials (and, hey, their design looks very familiar).
they also claim that there is no evidence that male and female brains operate differently with respect to learning.
in exchange for adopting a quasi-private stance and retaining these privileges, state universities would be required to fund raise and establish an endowment that is only for in-state students.
in my large lecture in social theory, about 10% got any version of an a, with a single unadorned a. i am not alone.
my main disagreement disagreement is in their response that ss schooling can effectively counter the issue of teachers treating male and female students differently.
in our view, courses based upon some textbook anybody could get at their student bookstore for $50 had to be worth little more than, well, $50.
– woody allen i have a hypothesis, shared by many social scientists, that life course outcomes are highly correlated with self-discipline.
these people take out massive loans for skills they will never use.
rather than argue at the level of values, let’s look at the historical record.
so it can’t be a bubble, at least they way most people talk about bubbles.
other products, like the headbands, are successful by preying on parental concerns about their children’s safety.
the stuff you learned can’t be transferred to another person, no matter how much they pay.
this is based on teaching a lot of public university students, many of whom postpone theory until the bitter end.
if you’re a parent you’ve likely spent a lot of time lately preparing for the start of the school year.
after all, i’d love to have more outlets for my work.
i’d focus on faculty funding formulas.
the classic agency v structure (or, actor v non-actor) debate was a good fit for the seminar.
many ivy league students are selected on political grounds – legacies, athletes, and various “well rounded” kids: researchers with access to closely guarded college admissions data have found that, on the whole, about 15 percent of freshmen enrolled at america’s highly selective colleges are white teens who failed to meet their institutions’minimum admissions standards.
also, more recent ucla data from the 2000s shows that around 60% to 70% of college students, depending on the question, want more job career advice from their college.

though, in terms of teaching, i’ve tried to move away from more than one slide per each class (i’m a chalkboard kinda guy these days), so perhaps not for class.
