but this oral comprehension advantage can also be used to build background knowledge in a systematic, coherent way over many years.
if we wait until a child can read independently to build background knowledge and vocabulary, we are almost certainly cementing their knowledge and language deficits permanently in place.
thus readalouds build language proficiency by exposing kids to sophisticated language well above their independent reading level.
they were exposed to that which binds our culture together, a common understanding — cultural literacy.

if you are expected to show at least one year’s growth in one year’s time (a concept i’ve never been able to wrap my mind around) you are far more likely to resort defensively to test-prep and “reading strategies” instruction rather than teach material that might not show up on a state exam this year, or ever.
core knowledge provides a path to all of the most desirable education goals: the ability to think critically and problem solve, greater reading comprehension, and higher test scores — because all of these things are functions of a broad base of background knowledge.

oral language precedes written language; we learn to speak and listen long before we can read and write.
they usually come to school on day one with smaller vocabularies and less background knowledge of the world than more advantaged kids, who tend to hear more rich and complex language at home and enjoy more opportunities for language and knowledge enrichment.
if there’s a secret sauce in the curriculum, it probably has as much to do with its emphasis on building background knowledge orally.
equally important, however, is preparing them for the culture shock that many collegiate environments will be for them, particularly the further away they get from the city of houston.
we’ve focused on “21st century skills” and used the latest technologies.
they are held to more rigorous standards that i and many of my fellow yale alumni were held during high school.
building knowledge and vocabulary remain the royal road to reading comprehension.
the disadvantaged students for whom antielitist solicitude is expressed are the very ones who suffer when we fail to introduce traditional literate culture into the earliest grades.

the only way to raise achievement and to narrow gaps is through a slow and steady investment in the vocabulary and knowledge that are the prerequisites of language growth and competence.
what they don’t mention is underlyingcontent , except to say: lest some believe this is setting up another false dichotomy in science or mathematics education between content and process, let us quickly add a strong evidentiary note: epistemic practices and the learning and knowledge produced through such practices as building models, arguing from evidence, and communicating findings increase the likelihood that students will learn the ideas of science or engineering and mathematics at a deeper, more enduring level than otherwise would be the case.

indeed, because reading tests arede facto tests of background knowledge, there is every reason not to expect the results to show for several years when the cumulative effect of broad knowledge acquisition asserts itself.
content-rich, nonfiction readalouds, often in narrative form, are a central feature of the ckla program and a powerful way to build a child’s store of vocabulary and knowledge–critical components of mature reading comprehension.

“the fact that fiction now dominates the elementary curriculum is not the result of educators’ decisions about what is best for children, but a reflection of children’s developmental stages, their interests, and their limited experience in the fields of science, geography, history, and technology.
the problem is, if we only teach children about their neighborhoods they are forever limited by the boundaries of those neighborhoods.
in the updated edition, hirsch discusses his central thesis: a shared cultural literacy “enables grandparents to communicate with grandchildren, southerners with midwesterners, whites with blacks, asians with latinos, and republicans with democrats – no matter where they were educated.
they want to ensure that the school provides their children with discourse patterns, interreactional styles and spoken and written language codes that will allow them success in the larger society.
if you’re not building background knowledge,you’re not teaching reading .

i’m curious what “research evidence” means, but i gather that it doesn’t include the research evidence that cognitive scientist dan willingham cites in support of the idea that students aren’t little scientists and need a foundation of years of core knowledge before being ready to function as actual scientists.
the freedom granted charter schools allowed newark charter school to adopt core knowledge as the content portion of its curriculum.
it is simply inconceivable that a non-driver would connect the act of balancing on two feet with the act of idling by the curb in a car.

the high stakes associated with reading tests may not preclude teaching a knowledge-rich curriculum, but it arguably disincentivizes it.

“the mainspring of comprehension is prior knowledge—the stuff readers already know that enables them to create understanding as they read.”

if each local school system imparts the traditional reference points of literate culture, then everybody is able to communicate with strangers.
“there is so much pressure systematically to do well on the tests, and this may not boost scores right away,” daniel feigelson said.
in promoting their ideas as “transformative,” the authors are overlooking the fact that the kinds of constructivist practices they desire are already standard in many schools (particularly those held up as models for others).

i could compare a spring afternoon to an impressionist painting; describe a sit-in on a college campus as an act of “civil disobedience;” and pick out the grandfather character in the composition “peter and the wolf” by the sound of the bassoon.
well, my bet is that einstein would have deemed naep data absolute proof of america’s educational insanity.

these were seen as a plot to prevent schools from teaching the linguistic aspects of the culturel of power, thus dooming black children to a permanent outsider caste.
a web page on the core knowledge website links to the the nyc department of ed’s data,background on the program, a presentation on the research underpinnings andhow the curriculum works with common core state standards.

we help people in the underclass rise economically by teaching them how to communicate effectively beyond a narrow social sphere, and that can only be accomplished by teaching them shared, traditional literacy culture.
if you’re not building background knowledge, you’re not teaching reading.
read alouds also have value well past the primary grades.
what’s less well known is a fact my colleaguealice wiggins likes to point out: reading comprehension typically doesn’t catch up until about 8th grade.
she just seems reluctant to teach it: “reading any text requires more than decoding, fluency, and inferring meaning from context; the reader must form mental images of things mentioned based on previous experience or imagination.
they discovered that a sign that says ‘no standing any time’ is not intended for kids like them on the sidewalk.
that is a good definition of literacy: the ability to communicate effectively with strangers.
our language is deeply idiomatic and context driven.
besides “practices” and ”ideas,” the authors mention “strategies” and “tools” (again, without specific examples).
it’s a challenge, but one i feel i’m surprisingly well-equipped to handle.
what i mean by “content” is the actual knowledge that is imbedded in quality curricula.
a first-year teacher, mr. reyes works predominantly with students from low-income communities and ethnic minorities.
i moved to a university environment where i both had to negotiate the rules of power, but just as important, work to change them and make them more accepting.
the inevitable result is quick fixes that overpromise and underdeliver.
the primary takeaway from the research, tailored for our 140-character age, was “new study finds nonfiction curriculum enhances reading comprehension skills.”
it’s fairly obvious that oral language competence precedes written language proficiency (we learn to speak and listen long before we can read and write).
when i say high-performing, i mean it: our test scores are among the highest in the state, we send 100% of our students to four-year colleges, and the selectivity of the colleges our students is only increasing.
i forced myself to read the ‘classics’ of western civilization before attending school, but i constantly felt that the philosophers and ideas that were being dropped on a regular basis completely baffled me.

i’m curious what “research evidence” means, but i gather that it doesn’t include the research evidence that cognitive scientist dan willingham cites in support of the idea that students aren’t little scientists and need a foundation of years of core knowledge before being ready to function as actual scientists.
a web page on the core knowledge website links to the the nyc department of ed’s data,background on the program, a presentation on the research underpinnings andhow the curriculum works with common core state standards.
my students will succeed, they will be ‘cultured’ and gosh darnit, they’ll prove some people wrong.
jenlee zhong calculated that if ms. krings put 50 cents in the muni-meter and could park for 10 minutes, for 40 minutes she would have to put in $2.
“ultimately, the authors show their contempt for teachers’ competence, the use of supplementary materials, and children’s experiences,” yatvin claims.
i can confidently say that i have great students and that they work hard.
if you were not so lucky, you might be like the person at a party who doesn’t “get” the joke the host just told.
“in early february the second graders went around the block to study muni-meters and parking signs.
she just seems reluctant to teach it: “reading any text requires more than decoding, fluency, and inferring meaning from context; the reader must form mental images of things mentioned based on previous experience or imagination.
it’s hard not to detect a certain worry among those who write stem articles for education week that the drive to educate students for careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics might include a drive to increase core scientific and mathematical content at the expense of things that constructivists hold dear.
they learned new vocabulary words, like ‘parking,’ ‘violations’ and ‘bureau.’
but the education establishment cautioned that a curriculum that exposed fifth graders to atoms, molecules and compounds and sixth graders to plate tectonics was developmentally inappropriate (translation: “hard and boring”).
content-rich, nonfiction readalouds, often in narrative form, are a central feature of the ckla program and a powerful way to build a child’s store of vocabulary and knowledge–critical components of mature reading comprehension.
it is incredibly condescending even to suggest that if a child cannot personally relate to a story or topic, they can’t possibly be interested or successful.
we’ve attempted to set high standards and given high-stakes tests.
their love of tejano music or their knowledge of the urban, ethnically diverse and youthful language that pervades their culture is important and it is a travesty of reality that their experiences are not considered part of the mainstream language of cultural literacy.
i challenge anyone to think of a nation that works as hard as we do to find silver linings in its educational failures.
gratifying stuff, but let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
you can’t simply slam into it repeatedly.
however, the gaps in certain cultural knowledge is extreme.
freed from the cognitive work of decoding, children can more readily understand a story with sophisticated vocabulary when it’s read out loud than if they had read it on their own.
and this is in reading and math where, to the detriment of so many other core subjects, we’ve aimed nearly all of our firepower.
however, the gaps in certain cultural knowledge is extreme.
it’s a challenge, but one i feel i’m surprisingly well-equipped to handle.
having access to important “core knowledge” isn’t school reform.
“the inner workings of a locomotive,” but colors, mountains, trains and transportation, to name but a few.
“this is a pretty strong dose of academia for children just beginning their schooling, with not even a ‘spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down,” she writes, forgetting that the teachers are free to dispense as many spoonfuls of c6h12o6  as they see fit to enable the prescription to enter the digestive tract.
tags: background knowledge, core knowledge, language proficiency, reading comprehension posted in core knowledge, curriculum, education practice, literacy, teaching | 11 comments » the new york times offers up a piece about a new york city school that has put building background knowledge at the heart of its curriculum.
besides “practices” and ”ideas,” the authors mention “strategies” and “tools” (again, without specific examples).
this is something that ccss nails, emphatically and correctly.
but when good instruction is coupled with a curriculum rich with substance, clarity and cohesiveness, young students will have doors opened to places they never dreamt of.
if you were not so lucky, you might be like the person at a party who doesn’t “get” the joke the host just told.
yes, it is hard work.
having access to important “core knowledge” isn’t school reform.
at our campus, we talk openly about college-readiness as our standard.
most of them are hard working, quick-witted and sharp.
well, my bet is that einstein would have deemed naep data absolute proof of america’s educational insanity.
teachers generally understand this, which is why class readalouds are a staple of elementary school classrooms.
follow me on twitter: @rpondiscio tags: balanced literacy, core knowledge language arts program, new york city posted in core knowledge, curriculum, education news | 5 comments » there will be lots more to say about this shortly, but the new york times this morning has word of promising results from a three-year study of the experimental core knowledge language arts (ckla) program, which has been piloted for the last several years in 10 new york city schools.
it is incredibly condescending even to suggest that if a child cannot personally relate to a story or topic, they can’t possibly be interested or successful.
yet yatvin also doesn’t much care for the “significant increase in nonfiction materials at all grade levels” and ccss’s call for “a mix of 50 percent literary and 50 percent informational text, including reading in [english/language arts], science, social studies, and the arts.”
if you look at figures plotting naep scores over the last 30 years, any upward slope in the data is nearly undetectable to the naked eye.
but i’d wager most teachers leave untapped a lot of the potential of readalouds.
they discovered that a sign that says ‘no standing any time’ is not intended for kids like them on the sidewalk.
the story is ripe with opportunities to build background knowledge, not about (strawman alert!)
they usually come to school on day one with smaller vocabularies and less background knowledge of the world than more advantaged kids, who tend to hear more rich and complex language at home and enjoy more opportunities for language and knowledge enrichment.
when students listen to a readaloud, cognitive bandwidth that might ordinarily be devoted to decoding is redirected toward the vocabulary and content of the reading.
then let’s use the best technology available and make the kind of investments we need in professional development to teach that content effectively.
these were seen as a plot to prevent schools from teaching the linguistic aspects of the culturel of power, thus dooming black children to a permanent outsider caste.
“for young children, the focus on academic vocabulary seems strange,” continues yatvin, apparently believing teachers are expected to read directly from the common core standards during story time on the rug.
it is simply inconceivable that a non-driver would connect the act of balancing on two feet with the act of idling by the curb in a car.
freed from the cognitive work of decoding, children can more readily understand a story with sophisticated vocabulary when it’s read out loud than if they had read it on their own.
it got to the point where the late-show comics were having a field day interviewing adults on the street who couldn’t locate china on a map.
broad and rich curricula like core knowledge would actually allow educators to improve test scores above and beyond a narrow test-prep curriculum.

if you’re not building background knowledge,you’re not teaching reading .
what’s less well known is a fact my colleaguealice wiggins likes to point out: reading comprehension typically doesn’t catch up until about 8th grade.
if you’re not building background knowledge, you’re not teaching reading.
if you were a lucky kid you were exposed to the events, literature, ideas and arts that changed our world.
readalouds are more than just an opportunity for a class to enjoy a great story together.
in the updated edition, hirsch discusses his central thesis: a shared cultural literacy “enables grandparents to communicate with grandchildren, southerners with midwesterners, whites with blacks, asians with latinos, and republicans with democrats – no matter where they were educated.
jenlee zhong calculated that if ms. krings put 50 cents in the muni-meter and could park for 10 minutes, for 40 minutes she would have to put in $2.
p.s. 142, a school in lower manhattan hard by the williamsburg bridge “has made real life experiences the center of academic lessons,” the paper notes, “in hopes of improving reading and math skills by broadening children’s frames of reference.”
decoding is a prerequisite skill but it’s not reading.
tellingly, miller suggests ten books for upper elementary students to hear out loud.
rather, it found that schools became so enamored with “social studies” that they forgot to teach world and american history and geography.
the freedom granted charter schools allowed newark charter school to adopt core knowledge as the content portion of its curriculum.

if there’s a secret sauce in the curriculum, it probably has as much to do with its emphasis on building background knowledge orally.
i’m a first year teacher in world history, working predominantly with students from low-income communities and ethnic minorities.
there is no reason to expect an instant dividend from a knowledge-rich curriculum.
but if they were lucky they attended a school that stressed the importance of, well, important things.
by placing subject matter content at the very heart of english language arts instruction from the first days of school, the authors of the common core standards got it absolutely right.
reading to students across subject areas–not just stories and poems–just might be the most underutilized strategy in the teacher’s tool kit.
and performance data strongly suggests that these curricula work for all students.
“experiences that are routine in middle-class homes are not for p.s. 142 children.
it wasn’t that the core knowledge foundation didn’t believe that economics and civics were important.
what they don’t mention is underlyingcontent , except to say: lest some believe this is setting up another false dichotomy in science or mathematics education between content and process, let us quickly add a strong evidentiary note: epistemic practices and the learning and knowledge produced through such practices as building models, arguing from evidence, and communicating findings increase the likelihood that students will learn the ideas of science or engineering and mathematics at a deeper, more enduring level than otherwise would be the case.
they want to ensure that the school provides their children with discourse patterns, interreactional styles and spoken and written language codes that will allow them success in the larger society.
in promoting their ideas as “transformative,” the authors are overlooking the fact that the kinds of constructivist practices they desire are already standard in many schools (particularly those held up as models for others).
the ckla students showed significantly higher reading achievement from kindergarten to 2nd grade than the control group in nearly all measures.
students in ten demographically similar control schools received more traditional reading instruction—the kind of balanced literacy, content-agnostic, comprehension skills-and-strategies approach i was trained to use with my south bronx 5th graders.
“the fact that fiction now dominates the elementary curriculum is not the result of educators’ decisions about what is best for children, but a reflection of children’s developmental stages, their interests, and their limited experience in the fields of science, geography, history, and technology.
growing up in newark, i was much like the average kid today — shooting hoops in the driveway, attempting to duplicate evel knievel stunts on my bike, spending too many hours watching what mymom used to call “the idiot box.”
things, for example, like “model building,” “data analysis,” and “communicating findings.”

if each local school system imparts the traditional reference points of literate culture, then everybody is able to communicate with strangers.
when i say high-performing, i mean it: our test scores are among the highest in the state, we send 100% of our students to four-year colleges, and the selectivity of the colleges our students is only increasing.
it’s fairly obvious that oral language competence precedes written language proficiency (we learn to speak and listen long before we can read and write).
this means that a strong case can be made for read alouds to building knowledge, vocabulary, and fluency through and including middle school.
there is no shortcut to building the vocabulary and background knowledge that drives comprehension.
we’ve focused on “21st century skills” and used the latest technologies.
i moved to a university environment where i both had to negotiate the rules of power, but just as important, work to change them and make them more accepting.
with care and patience, we can keep them there.
but i’d wager most teachers leave untapped a lot of the potential of readalouds.
teachers are conditioned to plan lessons around what they believe students might be interested in.
they are worth and that they won’t be judged for not having those markers of cultural knowledge.
the inevitable result is quick fixes that overpromise and underdeliver.
“there is so much pressure systematically to do well on the tests, and this may not boost scores right away,” daniel feigelson said.
we have spent a great deal and worked very hard but gotten unimpressive results.
but read alouds should be for more than just stories and poems.
i recently showed a quiz on islam i was giving my students to a couple of friends of mine who have attended college and taken classes on islam.
we learn new words by understanding the context in which we hear unfamiliar words.
i’d be mighty surprised to learn there are still teachers who need to be sold on the benefits of reading aloud to students.
but start building background knowledge of the world beyond a child’s immediate surroundings today, and you geometrically expand the number of stories a child can read for pleasure tomorrow.
tellingly, miller suggests ten books for upper elementary students to hear out loud.
reading to students across subject areas–not just stories and poems–just might be the most underutilized strategy in the teacher’s tool kit.
i could compare a spring afternoon to an impressionist painting; describe a sit-in on a college campus as an act of “civil disobedience;” and pick out the grandfather character in the composition “peter and the wolf” by the sound of the bassoon.
and for too many kids, their neighborhoods aren’t great.
this is not a core knowledge school, but the teachers and staff clearly understand the critical connection between background knowledge, vocabulary and language proficiency.
we help people in the underclass rise economically by teaching them how to communicate effectively beyond a narrow social sphere, and that can only be accomplished by teaching them shared, traditional literacy culture.
those who evade this inherent conservatism of literacy in the name of multicultural antielitism are in in effect elitists of an extreme sort.
i forced myself to read the ‘classics’ of western civilization before attending school, but i constantly felt that the philosophers and ideas that were being dropped on a regular basis completely baffled me.
if we wait until a child can read independently to build background knowledge and vocabulary, we are almost certainly cementing their knowledge and language deficits permanently in place.
they were exposed to that which binds our culture together, a common understanding — cultural literacy.
