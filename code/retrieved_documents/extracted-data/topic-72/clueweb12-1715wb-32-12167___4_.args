so maybe you can use this to turn the subject on its head and show adults, who want to learn other languages, why they too can learn as easy as kids.i can’t imagine how many people were on the fence, but saw a video like this or read some paper where kids came out on top… in classroom learning, and decided from that to give up, even though they have many many advantages the kids don’t.this stuff really pisses me off as the “research” tests in a context and environment thatchildren are bound to win on anyway (such as traditional classroom learning) and doesn’t test in areas that adults would be better at.hey benny, i found this summary (http://www.zompist.com/whylang.html) of why typical kids learn languages easier than typical adults, which doesn’t get into fmri research about the brains of kids under 5: “innate abilities aside, children have a number of powerful advantages: 1)she also claims that age one is where we can can no longer distinguish foreign sounds any more; “you and i can’t do that… we can discriminate the sounds of our own language, but not those of foreign languages”.i’ve had some frustration with some linguists in the past when they make remarks that they can’t back up withrelevant research, which serve no purpose but todiscourage learners.embarrassment is a prime motivating factor for human beings (i owe this insight to marvin minsky’s the society of mind, but it was most memorably expressed by david berlinski (in black mischief, p. 129), who noted that of all emotions, from rage to depression to first love, only embarrassment can recur, decades later, with its full original intensity).the most discouraging ted talk ever i’ve had some frustration with some linguists in the past when they make remarks that they can’t back up withrelevant research, which serve no purpose but todiscourage learners.they can devote almost their full time to it.learning with texts previous post: easy lifestyle adjustments to get a huge boost when things are going slowly next post: how to learn to speak your 2nd language as if it were your 16th: the polyglot edge the linguistic genius of adults: research confirms we’re better learners than kids!among the worst examples include an otherwise interesting ted talk about the linguistic genius of babies – in it she shows us a bullshit graph about the “critical period” for learning a language where all hope is lostfrom age 17.their motivation is intense.i realize that you don’t like to put yourself in situations like number 3, but living in a foreign country, i find that even as an adult, i get #3 from time to time.once again, for more specifics about how i think this works on a broader scale – read my post abouthow you are not too old to learn a language.their peers are nastier.
