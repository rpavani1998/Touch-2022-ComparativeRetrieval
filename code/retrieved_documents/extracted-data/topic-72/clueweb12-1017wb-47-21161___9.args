guardian:  the most accessible series for fans of standard superhero comics, although it works an odd twist on its inspiration.
an amnesty note that included selected portions of her letter would be truly inspirational - but moore doesn't own those words anymore, and besides, the thought of sending real political prisoners letters of encouragement penned by fictional characters is unspeakably depressing.
the hypostasis and the kirby angle really work, though, because morrison's essential affection for the character, and the artist and genre he embodies, outshine the insulting implications.
from the first tumbleweed in new mexico everything in this trip has been itself, only more so.
well, except that the love triangle absolutely depends on uncontrollable contact power-absorption and shapeshifting.
all in all i’m more interested in morrison’s dark-fantasy take on the camelot mythology than the fish-out-of-water time travel story, but we’ll see where this leads.
later that night it's a show at the viper room - we'll leave before the guns n' roses simulation takes the stage - and the next evening at a hotel in santa monica with just a glimmer of an ocean view i will watch as an actor whose work i know and like dances with my in-laws.
apparently letting americans die needlessly only becomes a problem once you startdoing it at home.
i'm also glad tony blair and the other g-8 leaders apparently didn't allow the attacks to deter them from discussing african aid and debt relief.

"this was just a pop concert to those guys... somethin' to make them feel better about their cheap import sneakers and their aerosol deodorants [...]
presumably this is meant to contrast morrison’s writing on magic with moore’s, a contrast that didn’t endear morrison to anyone despitepromethea’s lackluster ending.
so i'm grateful to those who have waded in with the goal of keeping our attention, our sympathy, and our ire focused right where they belong.
century hollow was to be my 3-dimensional map of political and social reality, not your tawdry theme park!")  that's also a conflict between realistic art and fantasy, a point jog makes well in his review.
paul grist and benjamin herzberg will also speak at the george washington university's gelman library at 7:30 p.m. on friday, october 14.
blair set the tone this week - i don't think the terrorists succeeded in wresting it away from him, although american cable news did its damnedest to let them yesterday - and for once he set it for something worth doing.
typepad informs me that this is my 100th post.  which goes to show just how much time i've put into a blog i started back in march of 2004.
although millar is obviously critical of bush, and blair's collaboration with bush, he gives all the best lines to bush's cynicism and condescension and claims of necessary evils.
it’s also relevant as a guide for revamping characters.
and then somehow i always end up thinking about the graphic novel and soon-to-be-a-major-motion-picturev for vendetta.

the garters are almost too much, utterly exploding the plausible deniability that lets readers pretend superheroines aren’t sex objects.
this was just a pop concert to those guys... somethin' to make them feel better about their cheap import sneakers and their aerosol deodorants [...]
as one commentator on barbelith notes, it makes ed "the spirit of superhero comics made flesh," a perfect hypostasis for superhero comics: aged and matured but still eternally youthful (or, depending on how you want to look at it, developmentally arrested).
still, that can't be any consolation to those who were riding the tube or the buses on thursday morning instead of saturday night.
the revisions are limited to zatanna’s costume, which gets a minor, faintly gothy redesign through the simple addition of garters and fingerless fishnet gloves.
shining knight: unlike most of the other seven soldiers series this one doesn’t reach a stopping point with the second issue, taking a comparatively lackadaisical four issues to tell a complete story.

anyway, if morrison is now naming characters "‘eezer badde" then he’s gone even more straight-edge than i’d imagined.
i'm always amazed by those who are able to immerse themselves into the political coverage and blogs and spin and come out with something cogent but i have neither the time nor the inclination to keep up with the inundation of words our political classes are trying to pour into the space left by the receding floodwaters.
africa has been a home to al-qaeda before and it could be again, and ending the cycles of debt and poverty is one of the best things the west can do to prevent future attacks - certainly better than starting superfluous wars against al-qaeda's arab enemies.
in fact, it leads to the destruction of the government that tortures and kills her.
i will never hug you or cry with you or get drunk with you.
i’ve always thought morrison had the most interesting anxiety of influence vis-a-vis moore of anyone in comics (certainly moreso than that faithful but pale imitator, neil gaiman);zatanna offers plenty more fodder for it.
klarion the witch boy: the most untapped potential, with a fascinating world it barely explores.
that doesn't mean he won't subject it to some dramatic changes.
an amnesty note that included selected portions of her letter would be truly inspirational - but moore doesn't own those words anymore, and besides, the thought of sending real political prisoners letters of encouragement penned by fictional characters is unspeakably depressing.
this week, of course, all the cool boys are mocking the live 8 concerts, which had the double gall of dusting off aging rock stars and attempting a mass political intervention in the upcoming g-8 summit.
suddenly klarion’s society seems much more carefully developed, if only glimpsed briefly, andklarion itself seems less rushed than dense with meaning.

speaking of which...)) morrison also works an interesting twist into the kirby kid-gang homage of the newsboy army.
and while “bizarre love triangle” is pretty good fanfic (although it very nearly qualifies asslash), i’d rather see the talented milligan produce new material, not just play around in the bones of the old.
as for the whip, well, she gets her wish, too, to her regret.
they’re built upon the tropes and history of long-established superhero universes yet they are with increasing frequency telling stories in which superheroes are all but irrelevant.
i suppose the comic is more subtle than most of millar's work, but that bar isn't set very high.
"  this confluence should tell us something, even it it's only that millar is a deliriously, exuberantly defeatist leftist too.

this is morrison's preferred path for changing the superhero genre, the heteroglossia of technical homage and not the imposition of cruel or tawdry realism.
weirdest of all, in a project called seven soldiers, there are the sixes:  groups of six heroes, abandoned by their sevenths, who meet terrible fates, and the strange dice that control fate, all that remains of the absent gods and philosopher’s stones the characters seek.
obviously a commentary on the fundamentalists who attacked america and the fundamentalists who run it (though it’s leaps and bounds more effective than the iraq commentary in something like phil jiminez’sthe return of donna troy, proof that sometimes agreeing with the politics just isn’t enough).

he won't look so tough the next time daredevil drops him under a train.
zatanna gives misty a lecture/demonstration of magical technique and legerdemain,demonstration being exactly what was missing from so many of those promethea issues.
plotwise, most of the issues aren't self-contained and it's starting to look like most of the miniseries won't be, either--not that this necessarily lessens the quality.

dispersing themes across different stories may be an effective and enjoyable narrative tactic but, contra morrison’s own ceaseless hype, it’s hardly innovative.
the sun sets behind a beach house and a private helicopter buzzes low over the surf.
plotwise, most of the issues aren't self-contained and it's starting to look like most of the miniseries won't be, either--not that this necessarily lessens the quality.
morrison revisits the climactic chapter of "american gothic", quoting a line of dialogue, duplicating its setting in baron winter’s home, and repeating its fatalities.
both comics feature female protagonists who venture into dimensions of "crystallized thought" and imagination given form; both of those protagonists lecture the readers on magic.
more links, more contradictions: "sex secrets of the newsboy army" is another story of summer's end (the name, of course, of the sheeda homeland), of kids who force one last childhood adventure when they should all be moving on to college and sex and adulthood (or at least late adolescence).
weirdest of all, in a project called seven soldiers, there are the sixes: groups of six heroes, abandoned by their sevenths, who meet terrible fates, and the strange dice that control fate, all that remains of the absent gods and philosopher’s stones the characters seek.
icaf is pleased to work in collaboration with the library of congress prints & photographs division and the caroline and erwin swann foundation for caricature and cartoon.
but to judge by their costumed identities, these kids already wanted to be adults, or at least a child's vision of adults.

well, not entirely: if i want incisive commentary on current events i can always go straight toold flash covers.
the case for youth is made by baby brain, naturally, and kid scarface (who will find eternal life of a different sort, and horrible stasis, in the cauldron of unwhen).
i also wonder if the jagged cascades of the opening pages aren’t a visual quotation of vintage bissette/totlebenswamp thing ; the script references a laterswamp thing issue, a deliciously nasty little solomon grundy story from mark millar’s run on the title.
morrison revisits the climactic chapter of "american gothic", quoting a line of dialogue, duplicating its setting in baron winter’s home, and repeating its fatalities.
the costume displays morrison’s admirable knack for finding a concept’s core appeal and unabashedly amplifying it.
the end to this first special is shocking not because so many of the protagonists die - we’ve all seen plenty of that before - but because of the whip’s expression of sheer madness and terror at the end.
obviously they're based on the newsboy legion template, with baby brain as big words, kid scarface as scrapper, and captain 7 and ali-ka-zoom can fight it out over who gets to be flippa dippa (i'm thinking the loser).
it's a classic morrison technique of holographic distribution in which each individual part reflects the themes of the whole.
for example, i was surprised that we never actually see the high market of vanity fair inklarion, especially after all the build-up; it would make the perfect way station between klarion’s underground civilization/penal colony and the fabled homeland of blue rafters, which could sensibly be reserved for the final issue.
actually, swamp thing seems to pop up all over this project, and not just as the one notable source for continuity in a crossover that otherwise is perfectly happy to play fast and loose with history.
"the anatomy lesson" is comics’ most successful reinvention, one that indirectly spawned an entire publishing line and a new direction in comics scripting: in other words, it unintentionally accomplished what morrison is perhaps trying to do with seven soldiers.
many of the journalists at blair's post-summit press conference today expressed a palpable disappointment that the summit didn't accomplish more (the notable exception being the gossip-obsessed american - sigh).
the concerts, the london one in particular, really did look like rock's last hurrah, one final albeit impressive manifestation of the revolutionary liberation that was always inchoate but never quite realized in its glory days.
his most recent storyline, “bizarre love triangle” (of course), probes under the skin of a longstanding x-men relationship and reaches the only reasonable conclusion that it can’t last.
the relatively flat reception of the first four issues wasn’t surprising, given that at that stage the interconnections amounted to little more than a shared setting.
but the issues might possess an even more important kind of self-sufficiency if even a throwaway story like "siege at century hollow" can dramatize some of the larger questions that dominate the narrative.

the editorial cartoonists' roundtable begins at 1:30 p.m. and the symposium concludes with the jerry robinson talk from 7:00 to 9:00 thursday evening.
the revisions are limited to zatanna’s costume, which gets a minor, faintly gothy redesign through the simple addition of garters and fingerless fishnet gloves.
one of the weaknesses of klarion, and to a lesser extent of seven soldiers in general, is that morrison throws out concepts so quickly he doesn’t have time to develop them all; some good ones die on the vine.
(it also wasn't that surprising given the staggered bimonthly release of each of the series, which can’t have been good for sales.)but now that they’ve reached their halfway point it’s become clear that not only are the individual series becoming more complex, the connections are increasing exponentially.
i've been following the g-8 summit closely this week, hoping that last weekend's call for african aid and debt relief would amount to more than just anotherwell-meaning symbolic gesture.
this week, of course, all the cool boys are mocking the live 8 concerts, which had the double gall of dusting off aging rock stars and attempting a mass political intervention in the upcoming g-8 summit.
as one commentator on barbelith notes, it makes ed "the spirit of superhero comics made flesh," a perfect hypostasis for superhero comics: aged and matured but still eternally youthful (or, depending on how you want to look at it, developmentally arrested).
early reactions to seven soldiers were characterized by disappointment that the crossover wasn't living up to morrison's much-hyped claim that each miniseries,nay, each issue would be a standalone story.
i've put a hell of a lot of time into it, mostly because i keep crafting long exegeses like this post instead of those short, sharp bursts i somehow never acquired the knack for.
x-force suffered a painful decline: first from an ill-advised name change (reportedly so marvel wouldn’t have to pay liefeld for the rights) that caused them to hemorrhage readers, then from corporate interference that gutted a major storyline which might have revitalized the book.
and so the spider is ushered behind the scenery to witness his own renovation, just like the beginning of another moore series, supreme.
others are hidden jokes:  i guess now we know why dyna-mite dan didn’t do anything in the bookend if cassandra has been selling forged tnt rings.
morrison also works an interesting twist into the kirby kid-gang homage of the newsboy army.

their new parliament threatens the submissionaries, who want to keep the town safe and pure by sealing it off from the upper world, who interpret orders from croatoan by staining the iron pages of his book with their own blood, who rule through the fear of outside enemies and the fear of their god.
first, jog was right - that really needed to be a twinkie wrapper.
in any case, the issue culminates with a bunch of superheroes (or superhero imitators) utterly failing in their mission – morrison makes it clear that a different kind of hero will be needed.
stories of how human beings make culture and meaning for ourselves, even down there in the garbage.
so the last couple of weeks haven't been any fun at all.
(the comic isn't any better written, as millar can't even distinguish between bush's voice and blair's.
still, that can't be any consolation to those who were riding the tube or the buses on thursday morning instead of saturday night.
that's just the way the system works and they just ease their conscience by singin' songs about us every once in a while."
i probably should have done it long ago, but i never quite got around to it until after they released theirreport condemning in unflinching detail my government's torture and abuse of detainees around the world.
but some of the intersections are starting to approach shared themes, ones that morrison has enough subtlety to leave unspoken anywhere but the intersections.
they're alsoevery other kirby kid gang, even the worst of them, the "newsboys of nowhere street" coming straight fromthe dingbats of danger street.
in addition, icaf will host international comics artists paul grist (england) and fang cheng (china) and eighteen academic presentations by comic art scholars from around the world.

he also surveyed the aftermath, a task that would daunt any reviewer this side ofpaul o’brien.
six years ago debt relief was supposed to be a pipe dream, something only the fringes cared about; now it isn't so fringe or so unrealistic.
what interests me is that while zatanna chastises promethea it’s also restaging, you guessed it, swamp thing - dragging moore back to his roots, as it were.
if there is a criticism of moore here it’s done by paying homage to his older material while snubbing the new.
morley oversells his case for "tony blair, world president" but at least he's been paying attention.
new x-men kept the skeleton of the vintage claremont comics, the presentation of mutants as a minority class and the maintenance of long-running, twist-laden plotlines, an art all but lost in this age of writing for the trade paperback.
the relatively flat reception of the first four issues wasn’t surprising, given that at that stage the interconnections amounted to little more than a shared setting.
the end to this first special is shocking not because so many of the protagonists die - we’ve all seen plenty of that before - but because of the whip’s expression of sheer madness and terror at the end.
there are the fish out of water, strangers to the modern world (shining knight, klarion); there are the abandoned children, searching for missing fathers or trying to complete their legacy (klarion, zatanna); there are the fallen heroes, looking for a second chance (zatanna, guardian, shining knight).
the concerts, the london one in particular, really did look like rock's last hurrah, one final albeit impressive manifestation of the revolutionary liberation that was always inchoate but never quite realized in its glory days.
anyway, if morrison is now naming characters "‘eezer badde" then he’s gone even more straight-edge than i’d imagined.
it’s offered a rollicking story about angry golems and subway pirates, albeit with a tragic undercurrent that’s never far from the surface.
bonus points to stewart and colorist moose baumann for the scratched, faded art reminiscent of an old and forgotten film.
blair deserves that slap and worse for following bush into optional war in iraq, even to the point of taking part in thefabrication of the cause for war.
the problem is that it’s only a bit of x-men soap opera.
a souvenir from my dad, who was there a few weeks ago and will no doubt be back soon.
it's the moral center of a book that compromises every other moral stance, including the stance of inaction, and one of the most memorable passages in a book that does not lack for quotable quotes.
actually, it was the manufactured, shoot-the-messenger furor following the release of that report that finally got me to send in my money; i hope amnesty's willingness to do the right thing and speak out against torture even in the face of such withering (and appalling) hostility and denial earned them many more new members.
jorge's revenge takes the form of a world in miniature of terrordroids and the newsboy army's destroyer is named the terrible time tailor.
it was a broadcast from some parallel universe where rock stars do this sort of thing every summer and yoko ono never sold her dead husband's songs to nike - interspersed with transmissions from our own philadelphian timeline, where hip-hop superstars talk about helping africa while wearing diamonds.
all magical business aside, zatanna is the seven soldiers series most tied to its character’s pre-morrison history.
the multicultural assembly of kids vaguely recalls last issue's century hollow, a tourist attraction in which one hundred animatrons form a demographically accurate representation of the world's population.
it's written by a fellow prisoner from the next cell over (in a sense), not a well-meaning charity donor who sits in provisional freedom halfway around the world, and it's scrawled on toilet paper rather than eco-friendly recycled paper stock.
the project has been built so much around absence, i wonder what morrison is going to do when he finally starts that seventh miniseries.
obviously a commentary on the fundamentalists who attacked america and the fundamentalists who run it (though it’s leaps and bounds more effective than the iraq commentary in something like phil jiminez’sthe return of donna troy, proof that sometimes agreeing with the politics just isn’t enough).
i probably should have done it long ago, but i never quite got around to it until after they released theirreport condemning in unflinching detail my government's torture and abuse of detainees around the world.
this is both the blessing and the curse of jumping in late in the game, so i’m going to dispense with the summaries and jump straight into my comments.
but there's the rub: the time i spend blogging is time i can't spend writing academic articles or books or fiction or novels or anything else.
but the separation may be for the best; exporting all my posts on crap comics over there always was, in part, a doomed attempt at making this site something other than "just" a comics blog, a craven bid at exactly the kind of respectability i think comics don't need.

all magical business aside, zatanna is the seven soldiers series most tied to its character’s pre-morrison history.
i don't know if morrison or stewart planned any conscious homage--we do know morrisonliked "the death-ray"--but the connection appeals to me because it would mean that, as withwe3, morrison and stewart are willing to pinchany trick from any comic to spice up their superheroic storytelling.
if there is a criticism of moore here it’s done by paying homage to his older material while snubbing the new.
some of those connections are fairly shallow, just elements of a shared continuity:  klarion moving through the underground world shortly after the events ofguardian #2, cassandra craft revealing who the old man at the bus stop inshining knight was.
bonus points to stewart and colorist moose baumann for the scratched, faded art reminiscent of an old and forgotten film.
i also wonder if the jagged cascades of the opening pages aren’t a visual quotation of vintage bissette/totlebenswamp thing ; the script references a laterswamp thing issue, a deliciously nasty little solomon grundy story from mark millar’s run on the title.
superheroes die all the time, butthey aren’t supposed to lose their shit!
anyway, it's nice to see our media growing its adult teeth back, at least temporarily, although it's come a couple thousand people too late.
i love the moment when the lights go out as the rain beats down and the sheeda assault begins; it's the first time the crossover has felt truly momentous and truly scary since gwydion destroyed zatanna's group or maybe since j. h. williams helped morrison finish off the first, flawed group of seven soldiers.
there isn’t a single mutant rescue, sentinel attack, shadowy conspiracy or plot for world domination in sight—not even so much as a bank robbery to foil.
actually, swamp thing seems to pop up all over this project, and not just as the one notable source for continuity in a crossover that otherwise is perfectly happy to play fast and loose with history.

klarion the witch boy:  the most untapped potential, with a fascinating world it barely explores.
it's the story of a woman who is arrested for being lesbian, who has her head shoved in a toilet bowl - at least there's no waterboarding, eh? - who is finally subjected to fatal medical experimentation, and who writes a testimony that inspires at least two other prisoners not to give in to the dehumanizations inflicted upon them by their captors.
if executed, this simple revision would allow morrison to claim seven soldiers intersects with the entire hostess advertisementoeuvre to form a multi-universal hypersigil, so you know he's up for it.
new x-men kept the skeleton of the vintage claremont comics, the presentation of mutants as a minority class and the maintenance of long-running, twist-laden plotlines, an art all but lost in this age of writing for the trade paperback.
in addition to asking for a donation, they included a small card - i'm sorry, a "message of hope" card - which they asked me to sign and return with the promise that they'd try to deliver it to a prisoner.
unlike so many other contemporary superhero comics, it’s not obsessed with nostalgia and it doesn’t attempt to revisit or recreate its own past.
all in all i’m more interested in morrison’s dark-fantasy take on the camelot mythology than the fish-out-of-water time travel story, but we’ll see where this leads.
i was evacuated from an underground station once during a false alarm in 1999, shortly after thenail bombings.
really, a perfect issue and one of the finest chapters of seven soldiers thus far; certainly the one that's got me most eager to see what happens next.
so can all those gauche public declarations and protests and grandiose message concerts, whose main purpose has always been to remind people at home that they're not the only ones who feel something isn't right.
the editorial cartoonists' roundtable begins at 1:30 p.m. and the symposium concludes with the jerry robinson talk from 7:00 to 9:00 thursday evening.

it's written by a fellow prisoner from the next cell over (in a sense), not a well-meaning charity donor who sits in provisional freedom halfway around the world, and it's scrawled on toilet paper rather than eco-friendly recycled paper stock.
the hypostasis and the kirby angle really work, though, because morrison's essential affection for the character, and the artist and genre he embodies, outshine the insulting implications.
i am glad the attacks didn't happen last weekend when london transport was flooded with an extra 200,000 people.
the comic doesn’t suffer for lack of skill; after a meandering and disappointing opening arc, milligan’s run has shaped up nicely as a clever character study.
for example, i was surprised that we never actually see the high market of vanity fair inklarion, especially after all the build-up; it would make the perfect way station between klarion’s underground civilization/penal colony and the fabled homeland of blue rafters, which could sensibly be reserved for the final issue.
there are the fish out of water, strangers to the modern world (shining knight, klarion); there are the abandoned children, searching for missing fathers or trying to complete their legacy (klarion, zatanna); there are the fallen heroes, looking for a second chance (zatanna, guardian, shining knight).
but morrison welded that framework to a contemporary portrayal of minority subculture, scientific anxiety, revolutionary iconography, collapsing relationships and ethnic cleansing that belatedly brought the hottest heroes of the 1970s into the present.
interconnections: i’ve resisted blogging about seven soldiers until now because if morrison’s pronouncements were accurate (and that is always a bigif) much of its innovation was supposed to lie in the interconnections between the various series.
i wish them well and i appreciate having had the forum.
icaf is also proud to present a tribute to the late comics pioneer will eisner, creator of the spirit and one of the inventors of the graphic novel, on saturday, october 15.
there isn’t a single mutant rescue, sentinel attack, shadowy conspiracy or plot for world domination in sight—not even so much as a bank robbery to foil.
so i'm grateful to those who have waded in with the goal of keeping our attention, our sympathy, and our ire focused right where they belong.
it’s been great so far, with lush art by simone bianchi, but the half-finished plot means there’s less to discuss.
i suppose the comic is more subtle than most of millar's work, but that bar isn't set very high.
the conflict is interesting because it exists within the heroes, not just between them and their elderly enemy; if it didn't, the horrible crime that sunders the newsboy army could never have happened in the first place.
shining knight:  unlike most of the other seven soldiers series this one doesn’t reach a stopping point with the second issue, taking a comparatively lackadaisical four issues to tell a complete story.
these binaries of child and adult, pleasure and control, fantasy and realism resonate throughoutseven soldiers.
but style and aesthetics and a lingering adolescent concept of cool are horrible reasons not to take part in a just cause.
it was a broadcast from some parallel universe where rock stars do this sort of thing every summer and yoko ono never sold her dead husband's songs to nike - interspersed with transmissions from our own philadelphian timeline, where hip-hop superstars talk about helping africa while wearing diamonds.
all in all it’s a smarter than average bit of x-men soap opera.
others are hidden jokes: i guess now we know why dyna-mite dan didn’t do anything in the bookend if cassandra has been selling forged tnt rings.
six years ago debt relief was supposed to be a pipe dream, something only the fringes cared about; now it isn't so fringe or so unrealistic.
it's the story of a woman who is arrested for being lesbian, who has her head shoved in a toilet bowl - at least there's no waterboarding, eh? - who is finally subjected to fatal medical experimentation, and who writes a testimony that inspires at least two other prisoners not to give in to the dehumanizations inflicted upon them by their captors.
it's the moral center of a book that compromises every other moral stance, including the stance of inaction, and one of the most memorable passages in a book that does not lack for quotable quotes.
the revelation that ed stargard is stuck in a state of permanent infancy is a little more biting than these kirby tributes usually turn out (although not moreso than mark millar's dr. krigstein inthe authority, a twisted dwarf creating concepts for his masters' misuse, to whom ed bears a strong physical if not moral resemblance).
i've tumbled from the hoodoos at bryce canyon to rooms at the flamingo to this beachside rehearsal dinner.
in any case, the issue culminates with a bunch of superheroes (or superhero imitators) utterly failing in their mission – morrison makes it clear that a different kind of hero will be needed.
it’s offered a rollicking story about angry golems and subway pirates, albeit with a tragic undercurrent that’s never far from the surface.
i was evacuated from an underground station once during a false alarm in 1999, shortly after thenail bombings.

how you can show so much concern for porcelain and plastic... and show so little for flesh and blood") seems all too applicable to those who can get worked into a lather over analogies about torture or representations of torture but don't have any outrage to spare for theactual torture.
the garters are almost too much, utterly exploding the plausible deniability that lets readers pretend superheroines aren’t sex objects.
this is not an abstract problem; this is not somebody else's problem; and those who imply that the british somehow deserved this because they have committed the crime of tolerating muslims have sacrificed the most basic human sympathy for the opportunity to score a cheap and false political point.
but morrison welded that framework to a contemporary portrayal of minority subculture, scientific anxiety, revolutionary iconography, collapsing relationships and ethnic cleansing that belatedly brought the hottest heroes of the 1970s into the present.
it's a classic morrison technique of holographic distribution in which each individual part reflects the themes of the whole.
apparently letting americans die needlessly only becomes a problem once you startdoing it at home.
it wasn't so long ago that these vultures were blubbering about our own tragedies and thanking the british for their tremendous show of support but that kindness hasn't been repaid; i guess africans aren't the only people looking for 100% debt relief.
blair deserves that slap and worse for following bush into optional war in iraq, even to the point of taking part in thefabrication of the cause for war.
suddenly klarion’s society seems much more carefully developed, if only glimpsed briefly, andklarion itself seems less rushed than dense with meaning.
that indirectly spawned an entire publishing line and a new direction in comics scripting:  in other words, it unintentionally accomplished what morrison is perhaps trying to do with seven soldiers.

but simply by raising the standards to the laudable goal of ending african poverty, blair has raised our expectations for what our nations can and should do - unlike his american pal, who's lowered them so far that i briefly mistook his admission that global warming is a man-made problem for a major achievement and not a belated statement of the obvious.
but i have neither the time nor the inclination to keep up with the inundation of words our political classes are trying to pour into the space left by the receding floodwaters.
but to judge by their costumed identities, these kids already wanted to be adults, or at least a child's vision of adults.

yet for all morrison’s loudly advertised innovation, milligan’sx-force was the more radical book, perversely repurposing one of the most superfluous mutant titles—one originally created for hack supreme rob liefeld—into a savage satire on mass media, popular culture, and the stuffy, self-important x-men franchise itself.
the comic doesn’t suffer for lack of skill; after a meandering and disappointing opening arc, milligan’s run has shaped up nicely as a clever character study.
morrison’s lessons are simpler - though also more appropriate for the character, given her background in stage magic - but he encodes them in plot and action, drastically curtailing the didacticism.

i can't help it; i'm skeptical of calls to action that appear to be nothing more than symbolic gestures.

this is morrison's preferred path for changing the superhero genre, the heteroglossia of technical homage and not the imposition of cruel or tawdry realism.
morrison’s lessons are simpler - though also more appropriate for the character, given her background in stage magic - but he encodes them in plot and action, drastically curtailing the didacticism.
i love the moment when the lights go out as the rain beats down and the sheeda assault begins; it's the first time the crossover has felt truly momentous and truly scary since gwydion destroyed zatanna's group or maybe since j. h. williams helped morrison finish off the first, flawed group of seven soldiers.
since i clearly can't let go of the ruminations on figuration and symbolism in comics i think i may need to work it up into a proper book: morrison alone rates at least a chapter.
he also surveyed the aftermath, a task that would daunt any reviewer this side ofpaul o’brien.
(it also wasn't that surprising given the staggered bimonthly release of each of the series, which can’t have been good for sales.)but now that they’ve reached their halfway point it’s become clear that not only are the individual series becoming more complex, the connections are increasing exponentially.
it’s been great so far, with lush art by simone bianchi, but the half-finished plot means there’s less to discuss.
i'll letsimon reynolds explain: ...the song anthropomorphized ecstasy as a dickensian scoundrel who always livens up the party.
in addition, icaf will host international comics artists paul grist (england) and fang cheng (china) and eighteen academic presentations by comic art scholars from around the world.
this is both the blessing and the curse of jumping in late in the game, so i’m going to dispense with the summaries and jump straight into my comments.
one of the weaknesses of klarion, and to a lesser extent of seven soldiers in general, is that morrison throws out concepts so quickly he doesn’t have time to develop them all; some good ones die on the vine.
the second issue has been much better received, partially because it contains no self-aggrandizing comparisons, though it quietly delivers on the promise of misty’s comments in the first one.
when moore's words are written up there, pulled out of their emotional context, they can look just as maudlin as any rock-concert message of hope.
morrison is so smitten with this new look that he has one of the other characters tell zatanna it’s sensational; normally i hate that sort of thing, but damn it, he’s right.
actually, it was the manufactured, shoot-the-messenger furor following the release of that report that finally got me to send in my money; i hope amnesty's willingness to do the right thing and speak out against torture even in the face of such withering (and appalling) hostility and denial earned them many more new members.
icaf is also proud to present a tribute to the late comics pioneer will eisner, creator of the spirit and one of the inventors of the graphic novel, on saturday, october 15.
but the issues might possess an even more important kind of self-sufficiency if even a throwaway story like "siege at century hollow" can dramatize some of the larger questions that dominate the narrative.
many of the journalists at blair's post-summit press conference today expressed a palpable disappointment that the summit didn't accomplish more (the notable exception being the gossip-obsessed american - sigh).
and then somehow i always end up thinking about the graphic novel and soon-to-be-a-major-motion-picturev for vendetta.
but some of the intersections are starting to approach shared themes, ones that morrison has enough subtlety to leave unspoken anywhere but the intersections.
and after their story ends (too quickly--my only complaint) we have the beautifully ominous final pages.
zatanna gives misty a lecture/demonstration of magical technique and legerdemain,demonstration being exactly what was missing from so many of those promethea issues.
x-force suffered a painful decline: first from an ill-advised name change (reportedly so marvel wouldn’t have to pay liefeld for the rights) that caused them to hemorrhage readers, then from corporate interference that gutted a major storyline which might have revitalized the book.
in fact, it leads to the destruction of the government that tortures and kills her.
all in all it’s a smarter than average bit of x-men soap opera.
interconnections:  i’ve resisted blogging about seven soldiers until now because if morrison’s pronouncements were accurate (and that is always a bigif) much of its innovation was supposed to lie in the interconnections between the various series.
morrison recognizes the genre's flaws but he loves it anyway, warts and all.
i can't help it; i'm skeptical of calls to action that appear to be nothing more than symbolic gestures.
that doesn't mean he won't subject it to some dramatic changes.
i've put a hell of a lot of time into it, mostly because i keep crafting long exegeses like this post instead of those short, sharp bursts i somehow never acquired the knack for.
well, not entirely: if i want incisive commentary on current events i can always go straight toold flash covers.
i will never hug you or cry with you or get drunk with you.
he won't look so tough the next time daredevil drops him under a train.
the newsboy army is that project of miniaturization rendered even smaller, a "united nation of kids."
seven soldiers special #0:  this bookend special sports typically accomplished art by j. h. williams iii, who adapts himself perfectly to morrison’s metatextual style by drawing in a pastiche that ranges from frank miller gritty urban vigilante to john severin western.

but more than just demonstrating some higher meaning, the correlation between the newsboy army and century hollow appeals to me because it illustrateshow morrison imparts meaning--by distributing it throughout each individual part of the narrative.
but others have already praised the masters or sifted through the entrails to divine plot details (jog and the people over at barbelith do their usual excellent jobs) so there's no need to repeat that.
dispersing themes across different stories may be an effective and enjoyable narrative tactic but, contra morrison’s own ceaseless hype, it’s hardly innovative.
the most accessible series for fans of standard superhero comics, although it works an odd twist on its inspiration.
some of those connections are fairly shallow, just elements of a shared continuity: klarion moving through the underground world shortly after the events ofguardian #2, cassandra craft revealing who the old man at the bus stop inshining knight was.
but more than just demonstrating some higher meaning, the correlation between the newsboy army and century hollow appeals to me because it illustrateshow morrison imparts meaning--by distributing it throughout each individual part of the narrative.
the project has been built so much around absence, i wonder what morrison is going to do when he finally starts that seventh miniseries.
in addition to asking for a donation, they included a small card - i'm sorry, a "message of hope" card - which they asked me to sign and return with the promise that they'd try to deliver it to a prisoner.
we know the witch-men are initiated with a trip beyond the wicket gate to see the god croatoan and "find out the sad, miraculous truth behind all the old stories."  their new parliament threatens the submissionaries, who want to keep the town safe and pure by sealing it off from the upper world, who interpret orders from croatoan by staining the iron pages of his book with their own blood, who rule through the fear of outside enemies and the fear of their god.

from the first tumbleweed in new mexico everything in this trip has been itself, only more so.
the connection appeals to me because it would mean that, as withwe3, morrison and stewart are willing to pinchany trick from any comic to spice up their superheroic storytelling.
icaf is pleased to work in collaboration with the library of congress prints & photographs division and the caroline and erwin swann foundation for caricature and cartoon.
really, a perfect issue and one of the finest chapters of seven soldiers thus far; certainly the one that's got me most eager to see what happens next.

later that night it's a show at the viper room - we'll leave before the guns n' roses simulation takes the stage - and the next evening at a hotel in santa monica with just a glimmer of an ocean view i will watch as an actor whose work i know and like dances with my in-laws.
i can say that morrison’s scripting is excellent, whether he’s writing sir justin’s dialogue in almost-understandable mock celtic ( another moore hallmark, reminiscent of the rannian language he invented for swamp thing) or transliterating it into english for us.
morley oversells his case for "tony blair, world president" but at least he's been paying attention.

this confluence should tell us something, even it it's only that millar is a deliriously, exuberantly defeatist leftist too.

well, except that the love triangle absolutely depends on uncontrollable contact power-absorption and shapeshifting.
the sun sets behind a beach house and a private helicopter buzzes low over the surf.
early reactions to seven soldiers were characterized by disappointment that the crossover wasn't living up to morrison's much-hyped claim that each miniseries,nay, each issue would be a standalone story.
the card and the check go out in the mail tomorrow.
but there's the rub:  the time i spend blogging is time i can't spend writing academic articles or books or fiction or novels or anything else.

they’re built upon the tropes and history of long-established superhero universes yet they are with increasing frequency telling stories in which superheroes are all but irrelevant.
blair set the tone this week - i don't think the terrorists succeeded in wresting it away from him, although american cable news did its damnedest to let them yesterday - and for once he set it for something worth doing.
