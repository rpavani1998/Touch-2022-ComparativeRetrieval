those who progress fastest and furthest seem to continually target their weaknesses while maintaining their strengths and finding the most effective strategies for learning.this allows kids more repetition than adults who have little patience to stick with something in which an immediate sense of accomplishment is lacking.in language learning too, some may have a natural talent that makes learning a language seem easy.for now, i’ll leave you with the above and hope that there is some encouragement to be found in knowing that we adults have all the necessary ability to learn another language and to learn it well.i often encourage language learners to listen, watch or read the same stories repeatedly.but as adults, we also have cognitive abilities to figure things out that kids don’t have yet.(click here to listen to the npr interview) one main theme discussed in the interview is this idea that kids somehow have a greater ability to learn new things than adults, that a certain point comes around puberty where the human brains sort of locks up and new learning becomes more difficult if not impossible.to learners driven by ideas of productivity and outcomes, watching the same movie twice can seem a maddening idea.his advice was focused at adults wanting to get started learning to play music, but it seems good advice as well for language learners.he also parses out some great advice for adults who want to begin to learn something new.learning to speak a new language will take more time to master than learning to paint a house.if you are reading this though, you are probably an adult who understands intimately the feeling of fear or embarrassment that prevents you from speaking or stepping up to the mic or picking up your guitar to play for a group even though you are still learning.professor marcus was interested in learning about how we learn as adults and as i listened i realized that there were loads of connections between what he was saying and language learning.malcolm gladwell’s idea of the 10,000 hour rule comes up and marcus agrees with the assessment that to truly master a complex skill, 10,000 hours seems to be a close equivalent to the time needed to really become great at something.if any of you have read guitar zero, i’d love to hear your thoughts and other lessons that we as language learners can learn from it.
