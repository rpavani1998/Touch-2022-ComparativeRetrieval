all my cameos sold at the last couple shows.
1 comment filed under editorial, nablopomo tagged as baby steps, goals, prescott, snow, success today was well spent at a good yarn taking a beginning kumihimo class from jeannie.
which is good, because i lose paper lists.
i should have used gloves though.
there are more equally effective ways up the same mountain than just one.
when you’re having trouble seeing things straight, it is also important to keep in mind that although emotional reality is real and itdoes give us valuable information, that emotional reality and factual reality are not generally the same.
but this one time, one of them was quicker than lightning.
put a bunch of brown recluses together in a jar and soon there is only one left alive.
since the bazaar too often has little of interest to teens, and more of interest to the younger kids, i’m happy to oblige hunting down some steam punk/goth rock/pirate stuff for them.
i poured off the liquid already.
in my mind, this type of mentality is the very source of division and stagnation.
for now, i’ll conduct myself ethically, pursue my passion with a pure heart.
i hope they help you too.
however, stress requires a lot of energy and recovery time.
though similar, each hat is made with different yarns, different hooks and different stitches to achieve the same essential look.
3) know your facts – articles, reports and claims promoted arbitrarily as fact and w/o references or proof.
omg i’m jealous, because i’m disqualified from this giveaway.
i’ve been in a horrible car wreck that i was lucky to walk away from.
not much different from settling the wild west.
in analysis, i think my problem was complicated by drought weathered tires and the fact that i have seen snow less times in my life than i have fingers.
today is run around crazy and do all the laundry day so there’s plenty of clothes for everyone.
but i did figure out that if i toss in the strawberries and other frozen fruit in alone, before adding spinach or anything else, it will powder them nicely andthen i can easily add my yogurt and greens.
this pretty dish needs washing, but will look beautiful full of peppermints and ribbon candy!
i mean seriously, when top crochet designers are down as experts in hotels, instead of the fiber fests they went to and there’s nothing about crochet on their klout profile, yeah, it needs some help.
also, no computer use during this time is also best, as the whole light issue is specific to your eyes.
still waiting on the right sized cameos for the smaller frame though.
everyone knows that whipped cream is a requirement for pumpkin pie on thanksgiving.
truth be told, i’ve been through a lot of them.
apples contain a substance better than coffee for keeping you alert.
beading adds a nice element to the spiral braid.
i finally joined because i kept seeing referral hits on my blog from pinterest and i’m pretty sure at least one pattern sale this month originated from that direction as well.
so i did it the slow way – trimmed around, stepped back to look, placed chairs, stepped back to look, trimmed some more, tried to reach here and there, until it looked ok.
after all, to their little eyes, i was just sitting there staring at a brightly lit box.
leave a comment filed under business, editorial, nablopomo lightly sweetened butter, that was supposed to be whipped cream.
from a wishlist standpoint, the easy photo-with-link system works.
in many jobs, you get paid a set wage + benefits.
in it he explains a little known clause in pinterest’s user agreement that gives them the right to actually sell any image uploaded to their service.
details were obvious to me in an instant from any distance.
and sometime before we leave, i’ll be seeing about dropping bypeaceful prairie alpaca ranch to see wendy.
anything lori doesn’t choose will go into my stash of stuff to use with another project.
as someone who tends to communicate fairly well, others often come to me with their frustrations in dealing with someone else.
we should celebrate that wonder and make use of individual expertise by adding the insight and value of others to our lives and teams.
however, i like the all fruit kind and i don’t water them down with ice.
mainly, there was a lot of trimming and raking to be done.
every week, killing every one, because their numbers were growing and the docile native wood spiders were nearly gone.
they could really help you know what you need to do and talk to you about the market right now,” i said.
that’s where i found my gorgeous blue dichroic glass necklace that everyone loves.
case in point: at a local juried show a few years ago, i had a woman come into my booth, handle/look at all my goods, ask questions, acted like she wanted to buy, let me talk to her about my hooks and methods, etc..
there’s also travel time, packing materials and postage.
if an item requires $30 of materials and takes 4 hours to make, you have at minimum a $59 item, before taxes.
this is the basic beginner's small kumihimo kit, long with my yatsu umi hanging out the backside.
sometimes, those pantsdo make you look fat and sometimes you’re dead wrong.
even people receiving training to flip burgers get at least minimum wage.
plus there’s the value of other elements, like antique buttons or sterling silver findings.
this doesn’t just plague leadership roles.
this seems logical under normal driving conditions, but here i got stuck.
been making them since i got out of college and could buy my first machine.
like that stitch guide i like but keep misplacing.
7) be responsible – own and take credit for mistakes as much as successes.
besides, i have this whole project on klout for tweeps and peeps in the crochet world.
i had to work from home to make it work out to be at home with my kids.
i’ve worked hard, overcome a lot and never want to repeat that experience, for me or for anyone else.
without it, he has a harder time putting his thought process in order or “getting it” because he has no mental black-board to “see” things in his mind.
a night or two of camping have helped reset my internal clock.
which is actually harder on the machines.
i even had a comforting picture in my head of sitting in front of the fire with hot tea and relaxing.
also have to be sure and go by thearts prescott gallery coop.
they tell me the cones are aging.
think about the fees you would pay a graphic artist when you don’t have a clear idea of what you want.
copyright protection is important.
i was taxed out of my $2.13 an hour each week as if it were twice that, because it’s assumed i would make up the other half of minimum wage on tips.
the timber flipped and it was on me in the same instant.
1 comment filed under health, nablopomo tagged as health, melatonin, nablopomo, sleep effective communication is the key to everything.
stay away from pedestrians (i marveled at the amount of people walking around cars that are slip-sliding in the ice) and be still if they come near you.
eventually, all these things inevitably led to me to the driveway at my hotel, which at an incline had me stuck again for a bit, and then on into a parking space way in the back of the lot.
i also found two new lacy frames i really like that are reproductions of antique frames.
as quickly as it was on, i swiped my hand down my arm and flung it into the grass away from me.
and by then, of course, i’d learned to cope with my circumstances – by hunting them.
usually, rather exclusive juried shows include better vendors and behavior than that.
8 ) armchair quarterbacks – those who sign up to volunteer, can’t be reached when it’s time to work, and then complain about how things were done.
they are extremely resistant to all poisons, except their own.
the last lights you leave on should be yellow tone or even candle-light, avoid blue tone like the daylight bulbs you find.
i was finally moving, and that baby step was solved.
i was the only one in the family who not only didn’t wear glasses, but had eyes that tested better than the norm.
a local driver with more experience and better equipment might truly have been fine driving out there, buti should have thought better and not gone out in the weather.
and by catching them in jars in case someone would finally notice not only the markings, but the numbers.

gracious and community oriented, this store is one of the most crochet friendly yarn stores i’ve ever shopped.
though that makes them sound friendlier to family than they really are.
very surreal experience, but it definitely taught me something.
if i’m not careful, i can be a talker.
on the one hand, i value good tools.
i am sent photos over the internet nearly every day in one inspirational power point presentation or another means.
you can create a board there to pin your favorite photos of daleks and actors, the electronic screwdriver you want for christmas and even thetardis kindle cover i pinned and later received for valentine’s day (my hubby is the best!).
pinterest even helped me get the tardis kindle cover i wanted, originally pinned by a friend of mine.
i didn’t have ready made whipped cream, so i whipped out the carton of heavy whipping cream i keep on reserve for chocolate ganache and whipped up a batch.
when he can verbalize thoughts as they take form, the quality of his work is amazingly better, because his brain is wired that way.
many folks might remember though, this kind of thing isn’t the first time new technology caused copyright concerns.
i just can’t fathom taking the time away from my customers and booth during a show to do that to someone else.
i work long hours in the volunteer world where you often learn a person’s true caliber.
umm, yes i found some goodies to buy in the box too.
in my experience, many may covet, but few truly act.
pointing out that flaw you want to forget, making known your weaknesses, revealing who you really are.
light destroys melatonin in the body, especially the blue spectrum (though serotonin levels do increase during light exposure – sunlight being best).
i threw on my hazards and looked for a safe place with enough space to safely turn around.
my sleep issues got worse after having kids and nursing and it took awhile to get my sleep cycles corrected.
avoid alcohol for awhile, consider milk-thistle to support liver health.
do not leave a candle burning while you sleep.
and the loppers we have are bent, so their work wasn’t the finest nor quickest, nor for that matter, painless.
if you have not dreamed in a while (as is the case for many exhausted people), the first few nights you will likely have a rush of wild dreams as your psyche downloads.
i’ve also found it’s a great way to find more things in genres i love, like dr. who, steam punk, etc.. the kind of things that pretty much it takes one to pass it on to find, but googling might not discover.
the internet is still a new frontier and as more people get on and learn how to make use of it and carve a new world out of it, the more needed tweaks and corrections will be discovered.
but even so, the process is very, very quick.
it’s easy to habitually ignore whatever she has to say.
it’s been an interesting path of discovery for us at home and i’ve learned to tailor my communication for others as a result.

however, as you already know, i don’t like adding ice.
and in spite of their reclusive nature, when disturbed they have no fear.
one of my fellow classmates mentioned wanting to make some for decorating christmas presents.
plus we should be able to catch the city’s lighting of the courthouse on saturday.
honestly, sometimes we need to shut up and let a picture say a 1000 words or let someone get a literal handle on something.
as quickly as it was on, i swiped my hand down my arm and flung it into the grass away from me.
the larger model might be less finicky.
no sugar, caffeine or apples too close to bed.
getting unstuck from any situation requires focus and patience.
ok, that’s not really the purpose of our visit, but i have enjoyed the opportunity to none-the-less.
stupid ninja, i wanted whipped cream for my pie and now i don’t have any at all.
if any cars around me started to skid, i was a sitting duck.
you don’t flip a timber slowly when you know it’s the home of an average of 4-6 recluses each,that you can see on the outside.
thank you all for participating and it was so awesome to meet and connect with more crochet friends!
the streets are iced.
they will also get random obey crochet buttons and rub on tats.
and by then, of course, i’d learned to cope with my circumstances – by hunting them.
details were obvious to me in an instant from any distance.
though i’m not a true antique collector, it’s hard to resist saving a quaint old treasure to find it’s story.
there are many different types, but we learned a basicyatsu umi, or 8-strand round braid.
and i spent over a year in physical therapy regaining strength in my left arm and hand as a result + years of pain.
start braking half a block away from stop lights and flash your brakes so those around you can see you and compensate in case you skid.
there are times the drama really ticks me off.
baby goal: avoid stopping since i seem to get stuck when i do.
just here in austin, there are shows that range from $40 a table to over $3000.
a well stocked pantry keeps you fed.
i receive a lot of hits from google image searches and i use image searches myself to find specific products i’m looking for.
your movement must be quick and you barely touch the timber when you execute.
first of all, this giveaway is uniquely open to usa as well as international crochet fans!
my tires seem to have good tread, but we had 6 weeks of over 100 degree weather this year in austin and it probably doesn’t make it easy on the tires when it comes to maneuvering in snow, nor do i have 4-wheel drive.
these flowers are made of a lighter weight yarn, from a totally different company.
that one person who gets under your skin, who acts as a challenge to you.

sure enough, there was the tunnel in the groove and the tell-tale hunched body with the sand-dollar shaped back and famous “fiddle” back shape.
no one likes to feel victimized.
that would also include those who sign up, can’t be reached when it’s time to work, and then take credit for being there when they weren’t, knowing people they don’t, doing things they didn’t and including it on a resume or in a job interview.
i am not eternal enough to contain all the truth and insight of the universe.
i truly believe that 2012 is just simply going to be outstanding!
overall, i see the pinterest service as kind of a reorganized google image collection.
be polite, but do not waste your time on them.
her character is able to be so easily understood because there is always someone who plays this part in each of our lives.
they will be quite fun to work with and i know my daughter’s friends will be interested at the school bazaar coming up.
because the quality of labor is much different.
2) know your limits – those who refuse assistance when they are running behind, “no i’ve got it” and then ultimately fail the deadline or project altogether when it could have been fixed if they had accepted help (or delegation) when offered.
however, it put me still going (slowly) in the wrong direction.
i find his daily blogs to be thought provoking and succinct.
add your cream, a tad bit of honey for sweetener and blend until it looks right.
and i think maybe ya’ll will want to get to know each other too.
flickr, a photo hosting service, is also listening and jumping in to protect their users.
i’m an expert in crochet.
plus, i came across an estate collection of gothic skull cameo pieces from an old jewelry store that i scarfed up too.
and triggers can be very individual and personal.
but beyond that, the truth is that some people retain and communicate best by hearing their own thoughts expressed in audio.
i’m playing around with lighting, with flash and without flash, trying to get the purples to really come out.
my hands are very sore.
the old ones were the only ones who managed to survive my jars.
i can’t help but ponder these things when i see people staring at their phones while a child goes unnoticed nearby.
as i uncovered stones and timbers while removing old leaves, various spiders scurried about.
if you’ve never done custom work before, this can give you an idea of what it’s like, at least for me.
on the other side, leaders who don’t know how to deal with a situation or person, so they literally hide from them.
folks crammed into the downtown area of prescott for the parade and other christmas activities this weekend.
and the class proved to me what i suspected… kumihimo might just be the ultimate stash buster.
however, i wish to entertain with a cook out, and to clean things up.
you don’t flip a timber slowly when you know it’s the home of an average of 4-6 recluses each,that you can see on the outside.
this attitude in life does not operate from a place of strength.
this is the first time i’ve used it for whipped cream.
though i’m not a huge pinner yet, overall i think pinterest can be a huge benefit to people who’d like to be discovered and i hope it stays.
the fact is, nellie has an unabashed way of testing you and holding up the mirror so you can really see yourself.
our immune system will successfully deal with many things until we sacrifice sleep, diet and sunlight.
and once you have that, stick with it and do not let buyers bargain with you.
when they are surprised like this, they hunch and hesitate like a cat before they spring or run.
it’s my guess that the sheer numbers of recluses at the shop caused them to be less reclusive than “experts” claim them to be.
5) communicate – leaders who fail to communicate and then suddenly freak-out and look for the nearest scape-goat.
however, i think the truth is that with or without pinterest, the copy-cats are there doing their thing anyway.
most everyone else stopped with a normal sized key chain, but since i was camping out for part of the day anyway, i kept going until i had no more threads left to work with!
but even so, the process is very, very quick.
other jobs, like waiting tables, are often half of minimum wage with the expectation that you will make up the rest in tips.
flipping a timber – you had to be quick  – and i was an expert by then.
a lot of words aren’t necessary when a picture paints a thousand words.
melatonin is created from serotonin, so if you don’t have enough of one, you likely don’t have enough of the other.
you have the cost of materials as overhead.
you can fill out that form here.
i know we can totally appreciate their plight.
seems they’re listening and they’ve created a code you can put on your website to disable pinning .
if i’m doing custom orders and find myself driving all over town from yarn shop to yarn shop trying to find what will make my customer happy, it becomes an expense that has to be accounted for, because they want a custom item and not something i have ready to go.
that would go for volunteers/employees too.
i attempted a few times to continue to make that u-turn, but physics proved that it was not going to work for me as long as traffic continued the way it was.
i was the only one in the family who not only didn’t wear glasses, but had eyes that tested better than the norm.
focus on the right now, so you can get to the future.
for but an instant, memories flood back to me of flipping timbers outside the wood shop, hunting for the spiders and egg sacks i knew would be there.
my daughter was kind enough to model them for me.
you can find my spider web crochet pattern on ravelry here: http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/halloween-spider-web—a-variable-pattern-from-aberrant-crochet .
she also wanted a gold accent for the flower motif and so now we’re at the point of deciding which variation is best.
locals i talked to were saying, “oh, this snow is nothing.
if you take credit cards, you have expenses there as well.
i’m not sure what i expect, especially as someone who values her tools, and as someone who probably doesn’t really know what was going on.
btw, you can view my pinterest boards here.
a small food processor will help you whip up the good stuff in no time without pulling out your blender and all the clean up.
these flowers are made of the heavier weight yarn like the original.
owners can also file copyright infringement complaints directly with pinterest to have pins taken down.
texting, surfing, i don’t know, but she was not talking.
this will give my customer a choice as far as color saturation.
staring at a computer screen is staring right into a source of light.
i met a lady from south africa today who said she’d heard so much about this store she just had to come.
i don’t generally believe in killing spiders, save the dangerous ones.
2 comments filed under editorial, nablopomo, random thoughts i was struck by a scene in my neighborhood earlier today.
and fight as i did, i finally caught it too.
6) listen – not reading emails/reports even when they are simple bullet points and then having to email/call them again and again.
old craftsmanship for sure.
as a result, it was possible that others might not give me the room needed should my truck fishtail or should my u-turn not work out as well as i hoped.
while hubby’s taking care of work tomorrow, i’m scheduled to take a kumihimo class at the local yarn store a good yarn.
especially in today’s fast paced world, time is precious, your time is valuable.
making decisions based solely on feelings is not a balanced place to operate from.
the invention of the copy-machine came first.
all too often, people avoid confrontation, so nothing is ever addressed.
however, my main focus needed to be on the first problem, getting unstuck from the ice and out of the center lane with traffic coming at me from both directions.
the grand ‘rents are staying with the kids back home, holding down the fort and giving us this time together.

i have to thank facebook for making it possible to bring people i love back into my life.
just because a hat you find at walmart cost $5 doesn’t mean it has a comparable amount of fiber in it to something handmade.
along with several small food choppers and blenders.
as i look ahead to what’s left of the year, christmas is not far away now and i have a trip, custom orders, more shows and school fundraiser stuff to keep up with.
if you are in their territory, all bets are off.
and if you do, you will have no trouble with it.
those who are more concerned with “winning” an argument than taking care of a customer.
even witnessed it to my surprise in the field of mathematics.
probiotics will help iron that out.
when the need arises, i usually whip up little batches of whipped cream with one of my small food processors.
remember that people communicate (and retain) information best in three main ways: audio, visual and kinetic.
you will find mugs, t-shirts and totes of hooky goodness!
as it is with most social things, i first heard about pinterest from a friend.
if you haven’t met obey crochet just yet, please do so by visitingmy interview with her here!
as it was, though it seemed logical, my initial idea was too risky and would put both my life and the lives of others in danger.
that can be a lot of time, especially if they don’t really know what they want or it’s difficult to secure!
she had examples of several made from a variety of yarns, thick and thin, including pigtail-eyelash.
thank god someone else can be an expert in car repair and plumbing for me!
upon tasting, though, hubby didn’t feel it was sweet enough.
by knowing their habits and every move.
they could understand someone staring at it.
now they can do it more openly and quietly by text.
i did however find similar and a mauve design i like pretty well.
consider that custom handmade should not be much different.
but enticed by the fresh air and clear skies, i headed outdoors to work on my back yard.
i’m slow to adding to my pins and follows, as i try to do so with purpose.
my grandma dot used to keep a dish of ribbon candy every year during the holidays.
today was warm and beautiful outdoors.
saturday afternoon i’m catching up with yarnies at method coffee.
though it does take time to assemble, it’s small and not considered skilled labor.
if you haven’t heard of it,remember the milk is a handy app that allows you to create multiple lists.
so mine’s actually long enough for a necklace now.
all in all, i look forward to a pleasant visit and lots of photos and reporting.
also, low levels of serotonin are associated with increased carbohydrate cravings, depression, heightened sensitivity to pain, and troubled sleep patterns.
i’m thankful for the experts in my life.
melatonin does not make you sleep per se, it will improve the quality of your sleep, help you get to that deeper rem and help regulate your internal clock again.
you may have to tweak your prices or process a bit here and there.
avoiding the person or issue will not often resolve anything.
from there your friends and followers can also “re-pin” the photo to their boards, link intact.
it’s a great way to share new products with others too.
factors to keep in mind as you consider pricing also include rarity, how labor intensive, precision of the work, and expertise and range of experience.
today, i don’t need as much or as often (in fact i rarely take it) and i’m much less chronically exhausted.
anyone who grew up reading or watchinglittle house on the prairie barks a knowing laugh.
once you have that figured out, it works like a dream blending up a whole pitcher of smoothie at a time.
the kind that only love and gratitude can create.
every week, killing every one, because their numbers were growing and the docile native wood spiders were nearly gone.
however, the weather turned out to be not quite what even locals expected.
as in, i’m looking up people who interact with me and am making sure they are down for crochet and stumbling blogs (that would be stumble upon).
your feelings might be real, but they may have nothing to do with the actual situation at hand.
they are incredibly helpful, friendly and a bright spot to visit.
leave a comment filed under business, editorial, nablopomo tagged as business, communication i lucked into some vintage finds at a thrift store today.
nor does it mean the yarn can be purchased in the us for so little either.
the bottom right flower is made very similarly to the original flower on the original hat in the same yarn.
it is sad to me that today i should wear weak glasses while working on my projects, not because i can’t see them, but because my eyes do not adjust from close to far as quickly anymore.
they even wrote a blog article this week on the copyright subject.
two of the flowers are in a heavier weight yarn than the rest.
however, after a short while, i had to head upstairs before completely passing out from the intensity of the day.
mine’s really designed to make the smoothies that you water down with ice.
federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
2 comments filed under 'tis the season, artist information & notes as someone who damaged their immune system in her early 20′s from sacrificing sleep, please take it from me and make this a priority if you have issues with your sleep cycle.
she may not be soft and cuddly, but nelly won’t try to protect us from ourselves.
just yesterday they enabled protection for flickr users from having their photos pinned.
l-tryptophan (an amino acid found in food like turkey) can also be found over the counter and is what the body uses to make serotonin, which is then converted to melatonin at night.
i would set them next to me with things to do while i worked, and i planned lots of activities together, but i couldn’t always just stop when they wanted.
part of the furniture sticker was missing, so i could not see the whole company name.
also on the same day came kevin lincoln’s article “pinterest might be enabling massive copyright theft” for business insider.
it’s like being in a cage and it can become a difficult barrier to break through.
if your friends won’t, the nellie in your life will.
it took quite awhile to get out of the hotel parking lot because of all the parade goers.
allow for the reboot when there’s stress.
if you spend 2hrs on a hat and you spent $3 on the materials and you only charge $4.00, $3.00 covers the materials and you just made fifty cents an hour.
before texting became a reality, there were plenty of people who could not disconnect from their cell phones.
once words are spoken, you can’t take them back.
leave a comment filed under editorial, nablopomo, random thoughts tagged as attitude, expertise, leadership i’m known to coin phrases.
there were some beautiful silk hawaiian ties there as well, but i decided not to get them too.
emotional reality and factual reality are not the same.
drop off your unused yarn leftovers, or balls you aren’t going to use, and debra puts them in a box for $1 a ball, with all proceeds going to the local women’s shelter.
however, you can only make a small bit at a time.
if you find yourself in prescott, az, i can’t recommend the local yarn shoppe –a good yarn – enough.
you’ll likely wake with dawn too.
i like to give people choices and get them involved with the process as much as feasible.
on our walk earlier, i noticed a shop with tibet imports i want to check out.
still, the back yard does look better.
flipping a timber – you had to be quick – and i was an expert by then.
jeannie even introduced us to using beads.
many emotions are caused by triggers.
i didn’t lay down for long, since we needed to meet friends for dinner and would be walking, but the bit did wonders for helping me finish out my day.
i was writing so consistently and then dropped off.
as i uncovered stones and timbers while removing old leaves, various spiders scurried about.
because deep down it sucks to see yourself without the ignorant bliss or the rose-colored glasses your friends and loved ones are all too happy to loan you.
so i’m wracking my brain today, making my “remember the milk” lists and trying to meditate on details in a logical order to see what might be missing.
also found a sweet little silver chain.
next baby step, change lanes and find a well-traveled road i could turn onto so i can hopefully work my way around a loop to come back.
you want to know at the end of the year, after all those last-minute material purchases and all the time invested and you sit down to do those taxes, that it was worth it.
it’s a little finicky, but my ninja works well.
when you pin, pinterest links that photo “pin” directly to the site you pin from.
my end goal was to get back safely to my hotel.
though several people seemed ok out there driving, there were people like me having trouble.
space rental is not cheap.
i love stories and love wondering about the past and the objects that were there to witness it.
meaning i have not really driven in real snow either.
even at $5 an hour (a minimum suggestion fromcrochet liberation front founder, laurie wheeler), you still have a $50 price tag.
still, the back yard does look better.
some jobs involve a commission, which is generally highly taxed by the government even if it is really what you feed yourself with.
and do not try to turn into a parking space surrounded by pedestrians and cars when your truck obviously won’t take the turns under these circumstances.
and before cell phones, they could not disconnect from their home phones.
i keep a perpetual grocery list this way too.
it’s a special day of magic really.
fear (not panic) is a motivator that can keep you alert and clear the mind.
recluses were taking over the place, killing off all the rest and no one believed me.
i’m reminded of a conversation with someone once about selling the home they’d lived in for 25+ years.
perhaps the amount of traffic in the hotel/shopping center parking lot should have been a clue that traffic on the main road wasn’t normal.
your movement must be quick and you barely touch the timber when you execute.
you can find my spider web crochet pattern on ravelry here: http://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/halloween-spider-web—a-variable-pattern-from-aberrant-crochet .
the fun thing about kumihimo (and i should have taken some photos of jeannie’s examples to do her justice), is that you can use up scraps of yarn and thread that might not be long enough to do much else with.
and in spite of their reclusive nature, when disturbed they have no fear.
pulling out old family recipes, taking time not to be stressed about the world and just be thankful in this sacred space.
grandma leona would have been jealous.
at the same time, folks have to stand up for themselves and their principals.
