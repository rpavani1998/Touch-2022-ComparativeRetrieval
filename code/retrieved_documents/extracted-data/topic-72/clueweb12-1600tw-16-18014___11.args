i have be aware your stuff prior to and you’re just too great.
goodmovies you have there this show was great.
i have had the pleasure of many types of dogs in my family, but i must say never have i seen a sweeter, more intelligent, gentle animal in my life.
being a dog owner all my life, i am empowered to continue sharing my life with them with respect and appreciation for all their unique talents and connections to mother earth.
and they sure did change my world my everything.
by arguing, all you’re doing is showing the kids that come here for the education how to be violent with harsh words over the cyber-world.
or your jack russel not to dig holes in the garden.
i must say that a wolf hybrid is not an animal that you put in the backyard and occasional play with.
one of the biggest problems today with dog owners is they go out and obtain dogs that gain popularity by their presence in a movie or commercial.
thanks normally i don’t read article on blogs, however i wish to say that this write-up very pressured me to take a look at and do it!
they have special powers.
i have a beef about people (1) breeding dogs with genetic problems including those with too large heads (births require c-sections), extremely flattened faces(difficulty breathing), etc., and (2) tail and ear cropping to suit show standards (dewclaws are another matter as removing them after birth can prevent later injury).
she makes me feel so good when that tail wags and she “talks” (not barking) to me.
the dog portions of his lineage were far removed…into the great grandparents.
close this window to: from: subject: thought you would be interested in the following link: close this window211 responses to “introduction” i think that the dogs here were very clever on how they changed the world.
nature’s “valley of the wolves” episode and do not believe they would ever intentionally mean to demean or slander wolves.
users may link to other web sites relevant to discussion, but most often links to commercial web sites will not be permitted.
i hate it how pit bulls r treated.
a person essentially lend a hand to make significantly articles i’d state.
i hate that wolves are depicted as savages.
would love a large dog but in a one bedroom apartment that would be cruel.
on the other hand, i am rather astonished by the low level of literacy of all too many of those commenting here.
we all play in my 10 acre garden that has a three fountains, a huge playground, basketball court, soccer field, hockey pitch, swimming pool park, and soo much other stuff.
we all evolved from a speck of bacteria, which i beleive that god made happen, therefore we should place ourselves any higher up than the rest of the animal kingdom.
im with ms/mrs lavine here kids come here for help dont teach them the wrong things heya i’m for the primary time here.
i like dogs much more now.
hello there, you have done an incredible job.
this is not to mention the rank commercialism of those seeking free advertising.
your site offered us with valuable information to paintings on.
i have recently started a web site, and the info you provide on this web site has helped me a lot.
if i want to see dogs, i can just take a stroll around the block.
please note that the thirteen editorial staff reserves the right to not post comments it deems to be inappropriate and/or malicious in nature, as well as edit comments for length, clarity and fairness.
as dog lover and owner most of my life i was mesmerized by the things that i didn’t know.
if they are adults, take a night class.
number two, we did not “evolve” from a spek of bacteria.
thanks, very great article.
i would take this as an an opportunity for learning and advancement.
but they make such a mess so my maids have to clean it up.
your text is certainly very powerful and this is possibly why i am making the effort to comment.
mrs. koplow, i can understand your feelings about the use of the word savage, as you are completely correct about the consequences if that is the intent of the word to use it for the negative connotations carried with the word savage.
generally i don’t read post on blogs, but i wish to say that this write-up very forced me to take a look at and do so!
in those talks, the research with the black fox has been an example i hve used to explain genetic/breeding selection for temperment.
i came across this board and i in finding it truly useful & it helped me out a lot.
dogs that changed the world introduction dogs that changed the world introduction nature’s two-part special dogs that changed the world tells the epic story of the wolf’s evolution, how “man’s best friend” changed human society and how we in turn have radically transformed dogs.
all animals keep the world going around….and we shouldnt forget….we are animals just like dogs.
the one part that i dinit like about that was in the how dogs changed the world part 2, was how the small chinese dogs were sloughtered but the soldiers who destroyed the princesses home in the twain dinasty but at lest a few of these beautiful dogs were saved and now the breead is back to where it is suppost to in a protected aer where no body will beable to kill them.
:-) sincerley, student from a illinois middle school the dog is very ugly i find it amazing how this breed changed some people like the blind or can go to the hospital and make people happy and when you are sad they will be there for you i find it right that they have earned the name “man’s best friend” beacuse thats what they are.
hey there, you have done an incredible job.
dogs are never ugly it all, they are smart.
i like the helpful information you supply to your articles.
i love dogs, cats, rats, mice, bunnies, hamsters, guinea pigs, and pretty much all animals that walk the earth.
in this way they have the same right like us to survie.
i enjoyed the program and look forward to the second half.
i bought this video because it’s a great intro for anyone and everyone interested in dogs/dog behaviour/dog history!
the level of literacy evident throughout the responses to this fabulous and informative program is lamentable.
as an ‘englishteacher’ myself, i can tall you that i wouldn’t praise my kids for mediocre or subpar performance.
this put up truly made my day.
we should think of not torchoring our dogs like we do at the rate we do now so do me a fav and make your dogs happy and that will give them a little smile on the inside.
^ as said above its all in the way that they are raised by the owners.
[5.4] (qu’ran) this is a video that is important for viewers to see if they love animals!
it’s very true,if dogs were never born in the world man kind would be lost forever.
the comic strip is tasteful, your authored material stylish.
that makes me sad because i got a peke who was rescued from a puppy mill and i adore her.
i’m looking forward to the actual commencement of my university research and the entire prep would never have been complete without visiting your website.
dogs are amazing creature they are so smart and helpful im happy to have them..and they deserve the best the possibility that instead of humans domesticating dogs, that dogs (or wolves) were domesticating us is fascinating.
i will certainly digg it and personally recommend to my friends.
i think that is the problem with most pit owners.
part i of this series was fascinating to both me and my labrador puppy.
i am dedicated though to the chinese crested breed.
very prive peep toe shoes black ,you can order christian louboutin very prive peep-toe shoes.
we are a bunch of volunteers and opening a brand new scheme in our community.
humans modified dogs to their want and with this came a number of terrible health problems, but do the humans care how the dog suffers - no. ugly, horrible, sickening, stupid, humans..
very excellent put up, i actually adore this website, carry on it
at first glance, and if it holds true to the quality nature has brought thus far it will be very enjoyable.
i always have fun with them.
fascinating stuff, thanks for sharing.
please… dogs are not ugly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 dogs are fantastic and very lovable, so much so that many humans obsessed with dogs would come to the rescue of a dog before they would come to the rescue of another human.
it’s so important to know what the dog was bred to do before making the decision to own it.
secondly, despite the fact that i can notice a leaps in reasoning you come up with, i am definitely not convinced of how you seem to connect your points which produce the conclusion.
preview part two: dogs by design get the flash player to see the wordtube media player.
thanks, very great post.
i’ll have to look for this on netflix, it sounds really interesting.
fantastic program, as always nature engages, educates and entertains.
anyway, getting back on the topic, i have been a student of the dog for many years and was surprised to learn some things i have not heard of before.
they help us and ther our best friends.. jus so many words to describe how i feel about dogs they are my life my world my everything.
i think that you could do with a few pics to drive the message home a bit, but other than that, this is excellent blog.
you have performed a formidable process and our whole neighborhood will probably be thankful to you.
i’ve been a dog lover all my life and felt i knew a lot about them.
i was at a safe and respectful distance of course; and savage would definantly apply to the course of action they took.
you’ll also learn how dogs’ finely tuned senses are serving humans and saving lives.
the ones in the show were mostly black, and it was during the segment that also discussed how melatonin is linked to the tame disposition, etc.
this is not an english class so don’t show ur teacher “skills” somewhere it’s not needed.
wolf/hybrids make terrible pets.but amazing companions.
i have a border colie red healer mix does that mean 2 dogs were put in danger i love all dogs no matter what shape, size weather big or small, fat or skinny, i think they are all beautiful,intelligent creatures that walk this earth today.
thank you pbs for excellent shows.
i have worked in rescue of aussies and breeds alike and am working toward a degree in psychology and ma in animal behaviour, so i can continue to work with dogs.
whether you want to look stunningly beautiful at party or want to be a stylish lady at work, these christian louboutin boots can actually turn a simple going everyday girl to an exceptionally gorgeous lady.
i believe you made certain nice points in features also.
your writing taste has been surprised me.
i would love to see more shows on this dispicable practice since this is still such a huge problem in the u.s and canada.
a number of kids do actually enjoy pbs and have posted comments.
it will be beneficial to anybody who utilizes it, including me.
in fact, i guide them toward excellence.
or the pitbull they would take a small stubby dog and bread it with ont that has a muscular body and it would come out to that.
now have a cute pom/chi mix from a shelter that is loving, fun, and a non-lethal watchdog(barks, but kisses).
i am sure they will be benefited from this website.
i just think it is unfair that you won’t get paid for a work done, whether it’s spec or a trial job.
frankly i’m surprised at the negative reaction from some of your readers, i thought your post was very thoughtful and true.
kimi ni todoke will turn out to be a great one, if the plot keeps on the manga
your video was cool i guess.
i didnt get to see this show, but if dish network has the channel, hopefully i will be able to find it.
its just that this is the equivalent of watching an episode about flies or sparrows or chickens.
you’ll also discover 14 dog breeds that controversial genetic studies show are the most ancient — and the best living representatives of the ancestors to all living dogs.

it actually was an absolute frustrating case in my view, however , observing this expert technique you solved it made me to cry for contentment.
you are making it enjoyable and you still take care of to stay it smart.
by tinkering with its genetics, humans made the dog the most varied animal species on the planet — and also created a host of hereditary health problems.
ill unquestionably come more before again as exactly the similar just about a lot incessantly inside case you defend this increase.
it took this show to educate and convice me i needed to learn more.

in part two, “dogs by design,” you’ll discover how these hard-wired behaviors help different types of dogs, from hounds to herders, excel at different tasks (and why it can sometimes be so difficult to train them to do otherwise).

thank you, l it takes lots of faith to believe that wolves, on their own, decided to breed out agressive traits, to get to dogs.
treated with respect and love the dog will show the same back but treated in the way that is bad or poorly does not bode well for the dog.
scientific studies and anecdotal observation has shown that they are not savages.
all breeds have been created with certain charateristics “hard wired” into their behaviour pattern.
http://earlydogtraining.com/general/furminator-deshedding-tool-review/ offered great insight into the dog’s history.
the show may be very informative, but i disagree with the phrase “all dogs evolved from the savage and wild wolf”.
i breed rhodesian ridgebacks occassionally and have discussed the make up of behaviour and personality many times with potential puppy owners.
sabre is greatly missed by our entire family and everyone that he came into contact with were amazed by him.
dogs do not care if you didnt put makeup on, they love us unconditionally.
during the show, the narrator was speaking about dogs being “hard-wired” in specific ways, and owners should realize they can’t change the dog’s ways.
these are some new and fresh ones :d beats by dr dre beats dr dre i’m not positive where you’re getting your information, but great topic.
you’ll also discover 14 dog breeds that controversial genetic studies show are the most ancient — and the best living representatives of the ancestors to all living dogs.
these dogs unfortunately end up in shelters because the owners didn’t do their homework and research the dogs intended use.
a have a alaskan malimute i my opinion anyone can deny the importance of dogs in our life,for different reasons: first of all,dog is like humain being a god creature.
i really like what you’ve obtained right here, really like what you are saying and the way during which you are saying it.
perhaps domestication happened because these animals had the capacity to love humans and see them as surrogate young in need of being fed was central to the process and no less (or more) planned out than on the human side.
keep doing what you are doing – can’r wait to read more posts.
i am most interested, but cannot find the place at pbs.com.
i agree with your conclusions and will eagerly look forward to your incoming updates.
in honor of a principled man karen sa oled nii ilus bakemonogatari is definitely a anime series that made you go wow at the end of each episode
as a professional dog trainer and behaviorists, i thought this was a great program.
ie still is the marketplace chief and a large component to people will omit your wonderful writing due to this problem.
i am purchasing this video to share with my third grade students in watts, california so that they too can be aware of nature’s unique balance as a portal to unique discoveries our world has to offer.
it shaowed how they breeaded diffrent dogs together to get the on that they wanted.
i’m confident they’ll be benefited from this website.
rock on :) just watched the first show on “how dogs changed the world”.
i totally love dogs folks.
disregard loving dogs or not, the evolution of dogs have changed the human lives.
in the preview they talk about certain breeds being in danger (probably from inbreeding to get the desired look) and they show a pekingese.
for those wolf lovers, the wolf has beautiful pictures and good information, including the efforts regarding the preservation of wolves.
it will be more energetic for me to read your next post.
the program was great.
if they are children, turn off the tv and learn to spell better.
i met someone who has seizures from a horse riding accident, and they told me the shilo shepherd they got started alerting her on it’s own when a seizure was coming so she can take her meds ahead of time.
i will directly grab your rss feed to stay informed of any updates.
magnificent points altogether, you simply won a logo new reader.
let’s try to educate ourselves enough to leave our opinion in a dignified and accurate manner.
i will bookmark your blog and check again right here regularly.
its certainly the fact that these dogs are animals and are such unpredicatable.
this lil ugly dog reminds me so much of aaron moses peace dude i love all dogs.
that is definitely great notion dude.iam truly proud of you .
i’ll definitely digg it and in my view recommend to my friends.
intimately, the article is actually the best on this valuable topic.
yes, i realize i misspelled a couple of words:) edit function would be nice – as english teachers, we know writing is a process, not a product, right:)
she isn’t the lap dog i hoped for, i guess she still has trust issues from being in the puppy mill for about 6 years, but i still love her like crazy.
very good written information.
you’ll also learn how dogs’ finely tuned senses are serving humans and saving lives.
anyway, i can’t wait to get home each day to my sweet peke.
i do not really make it a regular habit of doing that.
for the moment i will, no doubt yield to your issue however wish in the future you actually link your facts better.
i believe that is one of the such a lot important info for me.
hi, i feel that i noticed you visited my site so i got here to “go back the choose”.
and yet, according to genetics, all dogs evolved from the savage and wild wolf — in a transformation that occurred just 15,000 years ago.
my vet said that it’s really common for that to happen – because it’s one of the 14 ancient breeds, most mixed-breed dogs will show the genetic traits of those breeds.
i wish to say that this post is awesome, nice written and include almost all significant infos.
delta dog is a wonderful animal.
i would like to consider the chance of saying thanks to you for the professional advice i have often enjoyed viewing your site.
pet the dog love the dog, but do not abuse and provoke the dog because ive seen on take its owners fingers off because he goaded the dog constantly.
so u can see he is very nice… and now u might want to think twice about pits… i raise them and i know the truth pit bulls are a fighting dog and are pecieved as such in the public eye.
we should be thankful they are interested in educational programing.
i enjoy studying a submit that can make folks think.
i would like to consider the chance of saying thanks to you for your expert advice i have continually enjoyed going to your website.
useful job for bringing something new to the internet!
i’ve ,love dogs since childhood,never been without at least 1 or 2;ithink it’s very interresting to learn of the history of them,and the reasons for their selective breeding processes,why we would breed combinations to suite certain needs,need being the mother of invention,how dare we fool with natuers plan vs. our fancies,yet look at the multitude & diversity of our acheivments .it
don’t lose site of the humanity, afterall, its why we have such a relationship with these animals in the first place.
i was always more of a cat person but from now on i’m a toy dog breed all the way.
i like the encyclopedia of the dog best for this purpose, plus, for those of you wanting to know what a certain breed was that you saw in the program this book and the dog bible are great sources.
i watched both episodes and it made me smile cuz dogs are amazing creation..
he mentioned going to pbs.com and finding out how each breed is hard-wired.
i can see where all the different dogs come from.
instead that perhaps it is that the wolf when it hunts can be savage.
this was a very informative and entertaining show.
so are all animals, no matter how they look on the outside.
i enjoy seeing what makes my canines tick.
your writing style has been surprised me.
i’m a lover, and am always amazed at what they do for us, and the fabulous creatures they are.
weâ€™re looking forward towards the commencement of my school research and the complete preparing would never have been complete without surfing your web site.
secondly,they are very useful for us when they are previously tamed.thus they can be our guide, our protector against murder, and also sense.
add a dog to the family with the understanding of the type of lifestyle each breed requires, and if it does not fit with your lifestyle, do not get a dog!
wats good i am doing a course in england on animals, i love dogs – i own 2 bloodhounds and to be quite honest i do not know what i would do without them….they are so important to me and my family that i do not think anyone who hurts them can be stable.
hi, i would like to watch full video which showed on pbs,org.
saying thanks will not just be sufficient, for the wonderful clarity in your writing.
thanks for some other excellent article.
and i would watching more , i want to know more because they all 3 have different skills and different knowledge, they are incredible unique in their ways.
and yet, according to genetics, all dogs evolved from the savage and wild wolf — in a transformation that occurred just 15,000 years ago.
your show about how dogs changed the world was just great!!!
trained as a puppy to predict seizures from juvenile diabetes in its owner, it is a true miracle.
i had the joy of having a 70 % wolf-malmut-border collie-white shepard.
in part two, “dogs by design,” you’ll discover how these hard-wired behaviors help different types of dogs, from hounds to herders, excel at different tasks (and why it can sometimes be so difficult to train them to do otherwise).
and keep humans to a minimum if you can too.
we request your name and email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it, and that it is not junk mail.

how ugly of the human.
i am a christian and we believe we were created by god.
from the tiniest chihuahua to the powerful and massive english mastiff, modern domesticated dogs come in a bewildering array of shapes and sizes, with an equally diverse range of temperaments and behaviors.
they forget the potential for damage that these dogs can do.
hey,nature,this looks impresive,but i don’t have a tv.
even my own bichon frise still remains a small bit of her wolf spirit.
if i could be of any help to others, iâ€™d personally be ready to help as a result of what i have gained from here.
from the tiniest chihuahua to the powerful and massive english mastiff, modern domesticated dogs come in a bewildering array of shapes and sizes, with an equally diverse range of temperaments and behaviors.
it is intelligent, honest, and eye opening.
they ask you ( muhammed s.a.w ) as to what is allowed to them.
you’re no different from these animals, or better yet dogs are way above you haters… i love dogs, my dogs love me just as much, poor people who haven’t had a great friend like dogs, i wonder if you have human friends at all… dogs are beautiful.
well with your permission let me to grasp your rss feed to stay updated with impending post.
can you put the full episode online?i would really appreciate that.
perhaps it was as profound an intellectual breakthrough for these animals to generalize the notion of creatures needing nurturance from their own species to humans as it was for humans to understand in a cultural sense that their fellow creatures could be useful in other capacities besides sources of meat.
so as a dog owner, please do not expect your border collie to lie quietly at your feet!!
i really appreciated reviewing it and will discuss it with everyone.
i especially love herding breeds.
i have watched them hunt in the wild before.
despite the plethora of new shapes and sizes, dogs have retained the instincts bred into their ancestors by thousands of years of work: the urge to herd or hunt, to dig and to guard.
they are loyal and nurturing, and have a complex social structure.
sure, wolves are not tame and gentle with people, but they are extremely gentle with their pack and show all the finest character traits of modern dogs.
i feel so sorry for dogs, in that humans never have respected them enough to keep them as they were,but wanted to change them to their suitability.
it lloked like a rhodesian ridgeback only much shorter.
thanks for this valuable message.
however wanna commentary on few normal issues, the site taste is perfect, the articles is in point of fact nice : d. just right task, cheers just want to say your article is as astonishing.
what i would like to put to your consideration is that they are not saying the wolf in general is a savage beast.
it was completely easy to navigate and it was easy to look for the information i needed!
ok like i have 12 dogs, 10 rabbits, 9 cats, 7 hamsters, 5 koi fish, 3 turtles, and two ponies.
i believe that i would be very disappointed in another breed after experiencing the love and intelligence of our friend sabre.
this may be difficult to see in the u.s. where cows are kept under factory-like, highly rationalized arrangements, but it becomes clearer with subsistence farmers that keep a “family cow” that is can be seen to be bound to the family by affection as well as practical considerations.
i personally think that wolves somehow decreased in size and changed into different breeds.
i’m hoping to give one thing back and aid others like you aided me.
we witness the very unique relationship between dogs and their humans everyday yet it never ceases to amaze me how incredibly loyal each is to the other and how much each will adapt it’s natural behavior to the other.
information you supply on this page will only be used to send this email.
at 60 now, my education still goes on.
so i wish i could contain a special and secret cabin for them so they would live healthy, and happy forever.
he was a very integrated part of our family and his feeling were very easily hurt with just a curt word.
this is really a wonderful website.
i surprised with the research you made to create this actual post extraordinary.
but, that’s actually beyond the point – you know as well as i do that people posting here are adults.
for example,bind peoples use dogs to direct them.police men use also dog to investigate or looking for a drug among gang in usa neiberhood.
no solicitations or advertisements will be allowed.
and he is very protective he loves ppl he has never bit anyone.
most humans are not nice.
they thought dogs were why people lived.
this was so boring,i wanted to go to sleep.
the clarity on your publish is just cool and that i could suppose you are an expert on this subject.
in general, dogs should be left in their natural state.
for example how if they wanted a small dog with long hair then they would breead a chiwawa with a shitzu and it would be a small dog with long hait.
now, truth be told i have not had the oppurtunity to thoroughly look over this article.
looking forward to viewing the 2nd part in this series just reading these posts…now i know why i communicte better with dogs..
they are tough cookies.
the video is awsome the biggingis awsome i loved the video adout the dogs it realy touched me but made you should have put more facts about muts and thins like that but other than that i loved looking and learning about so of the facts.
i thought that the history of the pekingese was especially interesting.
thanks for fantastic information i used to be looking for this information for my mission.
this website is something that is needed on the web, someone with a little originality.
if the russian experiments shows that breeding for tameness results in dogs in 10 years of selective breeding, why is that all domestic dogs have come from wolves and none have come from foxes?.
made in italy,100% best quality and lowest price guarantee!

i am grateful for the help and wish you recognize what a great job you’re carrying out teaching many people through your websites.
i loved this episode about dogs, especially the segment about the silver foxes.
however, you command get got an shakiness over that you want be turning in the following.
they have powers to help the world.
dogs are also god’s creation and they are man’s bestfriend.
i also think everyone should realise is that thisa page is not for slandering off others for their level of ability in literature.
i came across this board and i in finding it really helpful & it helped me out much.
despite the plethora of new shapes and sizes, dogs have retained the instincts bred into their ancestors by thousands of years of work: the urge to herd or hunt, to dig and to guard.
there is so much about wolves that is admirable from a human point of view, and they are magnificent animals who deserve our respect and protection.
i did a dna test on my dog and the main result that came up was chow chow.
i’m in no hurry on this, but maybe when i’m really old (but still mentally and physically competent) after having a wonderful dinner of steak or seafood (or both), dessert, and of course some good wine.
:-( btw, i would like to introduce a site that helped me create a good content for a sites exposure.
i love dogs and i think we can study some amazing things about dis eath dat we live into if we can just place close attention to them.
if i may be of any help to others, i’d be happy to help through what i have discovered from here.
us humans would have never made it through the world without them.
nature’s two-part special dogs that changed the world tells the epic story of the wolf’s evolution, how “man’s best friend” changed human society and how we in turn have radically transformed dogs.
