research is showing that direct, explicit instruction in literacy strategies, including vocabulary development, helps students learn in all content areas.for ell and non-ell students alike, parents can help students succeed in school by letting their child know that they think school is important, ensuring regular attendance, and involving them in learning activities at home.however, we also know that struggling students and students who are not engaged in school are more likely to drop out, so keeping kids feeling like they are part of the school culture and on track academically should help ell kids, too.however, we also know that struggling students and students who are not engaged in school are more likely to drop out, so keeping kids feeling like they are part of the school culture and on track academically should help ell kids, too.recent focus on academic achievement coupled with the persistent achievement gap between english language learners (ell) and non-ells have caused researchers and educators to take a closer look at how to help ells master oral english and academic content as well.research on the effectiveness of different types of ell programs has shown that student achievement in the content areas can differ significantly based on the type of ell program in which the student is enrolled.research on the effectiveness of different types of ell programs has shown that student achievement in the content areas can differ significantly based on the type of ell program in which the student is enrolled.this is especially true of students with a strong academic background in their native country or students whose parents are well educated.teachers can honor the home cultures of ell students, make ell parents feel welcome, and show them what to do at home to support their child's education.while the research is pretty persuasive about the benefit of some first language instruction, in language diverse districts like yours it can be really difficult to provide qualified teachers for each of the languages your students bring to the classroom.in fact, fred genessee and colleagues concluded that an emphasis on academic english is likely to yield a payoff in student achievement "even in english-only school settings."for example, some people may fear that teaching a child in his or her native language may keep the child from learning english.your best resources might come from your community in the form of bilingual volunteers or aides who can help bridge the language gap.to be effective, they may need professional development and other supports.on the other hand, some students who do not speak english very well may perform well academically.
