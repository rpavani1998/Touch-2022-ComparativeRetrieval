i had thought, at the time, that i would probably be a technical writer, but i always had the mind-set of leaving my options open, of always looking around to see where i could best create value.
to my surprise, we came out a bit ahead, financially, because i was able to keep up with much of my work while saving on the cost of the school.
eric would certainly be the one to show me.
this november 2006 ended with the four of us sick, hanging out on the sofa and watching quite a bit of of tv (national geographic, the food network, and animal planet), learning quite a bit about dogs (we just found outsophie has giardia probably from drinking from the creek or from the soil?…how’s that?...what do we do?....yuck...), talking about white blood cells, making stats sheets on pro football teams, and learninghow to make chicken soup 3 different ways off of one chicken.
when my firstborn was very young, i pounced on each “learning moment,” overly eager to make sure my daughter received every possible kind of support and encouragement for learning.
i think it’s a fallacy for parents (homeschooling or not) to take credit for our adult children’s successes or failures.
i used to arrogantly think that when adult kids made rotten choices, their parents must have failed horribly in some way.
we also “cover” our science, our math, our geography, and our language arts in a similar fashion.
and in wading through finance information, i am routinely smacked with fears, attachments, emotional wounds, unmet needs, and oh man, the obsolete strategies.

if the things we plan are enjoyable, interesting, and fun, the chance of  our child wanting to learn more is increased.
president woodrow wilson was taught at home by his father, who wasn't concerned when woodrow didn't learn his letters and numbers as quickly as children who were in schools.
i figured that field trips with other homeschoolers, day trips on our own, and vacations like this one, provided perfect opportunities for learning to record what the kids have learned.
we are creating our own personal goals and living them out, and we are empowered by our own independence to change our direction and our goals when they no longer serve us.
since beginning this move toward sanity, we have seen our steps repeated by others, and now have a small circle of friends and family members who have also chosen to back away from a stressful, harried, and cheapened holiday season.
we are reading dog poems, dog stories, dog myths and legends.
i felt grateful that my children were not into baseball, especially to that degree.
a friend, who had braved the shopping chaos, said that the local outlet mall (“virginia’s number one tourist attraction!”) was so packed with gift-seekers that parking overflowed to outlying lots, and that it was “a zoo out there!"
i read with great interest stories of homeschooled or self-taught people, trying to find clues that would help me guide my children in a way that would result in them becoming self-directed.
most of these books, magazines, toys, manipulatives, games, and other resources have been disposed of—sold, given away, or donated tovahomeschoolers’ used resource sale—having never captured my children’s interest.
the children find stocking stuffers and candy in their stockings, and a few gifts under our little tree.
we spend little, stress none, and find great satisfaction.
a couple of weeks ago, laurel, the thirteen-year-old, noted matter-of-factly that she had just finished reading the unabridged “ pride and prejudice,” and today added that she has since then read “sense and sensibility,” and plans to read “ emma” soon.
while working through my own finance baggage, i realized that scott's gap exists every bit as much for money as it does for parenting.
one never knows what small act may plant the seeds of a revolution.
probably even more important, i unconsciously modeled a love for reading and research, reading voraciously whenever i can find a moment, sometimes when i should be doing something else!
when i graduated high school, i still couldn't keep a conversation going in the language.
robin considers herself a budding naturalist and conservationist and a spiritual eclectic who enjoys celebrating the wheel of the year with her own unique blend of earth-centered world traditions.
i read the book and found it fascinating.
this does not mean that eric has been doing "nothing" since 16, although sometimes it can appear that way from the outside looking in.
she learned to weave on a little loom, and had a mexican themed birthday party.
i was able to get online teachers' guides at pbs.org/masterpiece.
gift giving did not disappear, but we downplay the focus on material things.
because modeling is such a huge part of unschooling, i need to model fiscal responsibility and financial empowerment, if that’s what i want them to learn.
it’s never too late, however, whether our kids are four, ten or thirty-four, to tell them we love them, to admit we’re human and we have made mistakes, and to try to do better in the future.
what i'm understanding is that i don't get to define or own any of my children's successes or failures.
it's on-the-job training.
my husband is a mathematician, and although technically we could live on his salary, we wouldn't be able to save much for retirement if i didn't also work.
if they “proved” that they are learning this stuff, they might be considered excellent, motivated, average, above average, gifted, motivated, attentive, successful, and so on.
i learned how to learn through my studies of language because it was something that clicked with me, and i studied it because i wanted to.
you can help your child make portfolios or scrapbooks of his or her learning journey, too!
i used to arrogantly think that when adult kids made rotten choices, their parents must have failed horribly in some way.
he had taken two courses with very different instructors and expectations for what made up his end grade.
when thinking about woodrow being a later reader, i re-read some of dr. raymond moore's books, particularly "better late than early".
we can't prepare our kids for everything.
i 'got" language from the very first week i was in spanish class.
i love what i do professionally, and would want to continue even if it didn't contribute much to our bottom line.
as parents we can only do the best we can with what we know at the time and keep doing the best we can all along the way.
i understood how it worked because it made sense to me.
eric began a more serious portfolio collection of his work.
we are learning together and with friends, family and just folks we meet at the library, the pet store, the grocery store and so on, and then there are our fellow students in dog training class.
in other words, it's easy to change your mind, but implementing a change in your whole self is far more difficult, especially when going against the grain of society and culture.
in a political-economic system such as we have in the united states, it is possible to create one's own opportunity; a person never need be constrained by someone else's vision of one's professional life.
if we were lucky enough to have financially astute parents, then maybe we got that knowledge passed to us, but the vast majority of us didn’t.
as parents we can only do the best we can with what we know at the time and keep doing the best we can all along the way.
i would not want to have to fake interest in my children’s interests, and that would be the case with baseball, or most any team sport.
i’m reading books and websites, i’m tackling one major pain point a month: tax filing system, insurance organization, creating a trust, establishing a money market account, learning about the stock market.
she's a lifelong californian, which lends a very distinctive spin to both her ideas and her politics, and she's discovered, in her peregrinations, that the world is far smaller yet far more fascinating than anyone gives it credit for being.
if we let people pursue the things that make sense for them, they will naturally pick the things that they "get”.
day trips can be just as rewarding and educational!
find some nature journals at the library to use as examples.
and yet, eric was simply remaining true to what real learning is and embracing the learning environment and perspective we created for him.
i try to model lifelong learning by indulging my love of books, reading out loud to my children early and often, having plenty of books available on subjects that interest them (and things i would like them to learn about), and visiting our library at least weekly.
another year, we explored the traditions of her birth country and had a korean birthday party.
life takes care of the content.
it would be impossible to duplicate the experiences of homeschoolers from the past, or even the present.
no matter what specific facts or skills we teach them, so long as they have the ability and confidence to learn, they are prepared for any path they choose.
while i do have a general sense of what they are learning, and what they know, their educational journeys are largely hidden from me.
living out our "teachable moments" gives us a direct connection to the learning that  lives in life, our lives.
one thing they will have, which i never understood while growing up, is a sense that hard work--when it's something you love--is pleasurable, and constitutes a significant part of a fulfilled life.
and likewise, when our kids (adults, but yes, still our kids, in our hearts) choose horribly and end up in the ditch and either don’t choose to or find themselves unable to crawl back out again, we really shouldn’t beat ourselves up for it.
they appreciate that the holiday season no longer brings stress and strain to our home, right through to the gift aftermath and emotional letdown.
“just make sure you introduce some history (any history),” he said.
we also “cover” our science, our math, our geography, and our language arts in a similar fashion.
we get involved in life and pursue it.
a dog splurge does not make an education complete, and we were learning more than about sophie these past november days.
i figured these life lessons would stand them in good stead, and so far, that has proven true.
but i found that if i give myself the same patience and encouragement with baby steps that i allow them, that i come along just fine.
good advice for anyone, this can also be part of your kids education.
we work together until about noon, often with me having to interrupt myself from working with them to talk with clients or to answer emails (my laptop and i are joined at the hip).
they can disregard our teachings totally some day.
at first, my children and i were only able to identify what we did not like about the holiday madness, but we were not sure exactly what we wanted to keep.
we are living those teachable moments by living our lives and learning as we go.
one of my greatest personal pleasures is that my girls get to see, every day, what work means.
i had an intellectual understanding of free-market economics in college, and when i started working, seeing this in action was a wonderful confirmation.
i suspected that, given the declining quality of teachers over the past 40 years, their main teacher would need to be me.
life takes care of the content.
eric began a more serious portfolio collection of his work.
they made it known that i am privileged to be on their list of recipients of “the talisman,” howl in protest if i come into the room while they are writing, and they shoo me away from their theatre rehearsals, refusing to even let me hear their audition monologs.
they didn’t have to be prodigies, mind you, just demonstrate that they were, indeed, learning, and that they were, indeed, becoming themselves.
one of my greatest personal pleasures is that my girls get to see, every day, what work means.
i suspected that, given the declining quality of teachers over the past 40 years, their main teacher would need to be me.
robin considers herself a budding naturalist and conservationist and a spiritual eclectic who enjoys celebrating the wheel of the year with her own unique blend of earth-centered world traditions.
if your child has a unique learning style, or learning differences, it's easy for him or her to fall behind if left in a typical classroom setting.
we spend little, stress none, and find great satisfaction.
it’s never too late, however, whether our kids are four, ten or thirty-four, to tell them we love them, to admit we’re human and we have made mistakes, and to try to do better in the future.
when writing about my children’s education, i search for that anecdotal evidence that learning happens—a task that is frustrated by my daughters’ need for privacy, for their need of identities separate from my own.
eric sought these part-time jobs because he wanted the benefit of pursuing diverse interests during the other part of his available time that required the necessity of financial backing.
the learning is a direct primary reinforcement.
this | save to del.icio.us by tammy by far, the most important element of preparing our children for their future is to teach them how to learn.
while this may be a somewhat important skill for kids to develop in a large classroom setting, truly gifted teachers do things that make kids want to be ready to learn when the teacher walks in the door.
so even before the girls were born, i designed my businesses to be run from home so that i could be the one to educate them.
one is that i would continue to have to question and scrutinize the conditioned responses and expectations i hold from our societal and cultural surroundings regarding finding one's own pathway to adulthood.
a friend, who had braved the shopping chaos, said that the local outlet mall (“virginia’s number one tourist attraction!”) was so packed with gift-seekers that parking overflowed to outlying lots, and that it was “a zoo out there!" instead of wending my way through ravenous throngs and standing in interminable lines that day, i enjoyed the lovely seventy-degree weather, hanging laundry on the line, and going on an extra-long bicycle ride.
we gave it a good try, but found it a grim, somewhat anti-intellectual place, with lots of rules.
and in wading through finance information, i am routinely smacked with fears, attachments, emotional wounds, unmet needs, and oh man, the obsolete strategies.
initially, he has not been willing to compromise the learning principles, environment, and support from which he has become accustomed through the unschooling lifestyle.
my son would be in kindergarten this year if in a traditional school setting, and my daughter would be in third grade.
when writing about my children’s education, i search for that anecdotal evidence that learning happens—a task that is frustrated by my daughters’ need for privacy, for their need of identities separate from my own.
the girls watched them raptly, declaring them “brilliant.”
at last, i can allow each of them complete freedom in building her own “house of tomorrow.”
i had the feeling that if my children were required to contribute to their own upkeep, so to speak, that they would acquire naturally a desire to be self-sufficient.
by cindy i ended my last post about my oldest son, eric's, first experience with formal education through a dual-enrollment community college program.
by marsha quite often when children experience difficulties in school, it's because of a bad fit.
one is that i would continue to have to question and scrutinize the conditioned responses and expectations i hold from our societal and cultural surroundings regarding finding one's own pathway to adulthood.
when my firstborn was very young, i pounced on each “learning moment,” overly eager to make sure my daughter received every possible kind of support and encouragement for learning.
because the girls liked the school so well, i decided to let them stay there for their early education, which would let me continue to work.
still, my daughter, and her younger sister, laurel, did not latch on to any particular interest, although children all around us were doing so.
i have always determined that my children would have the best education possible so that they will, in turn, be able to find their own dream jobs someday.
i didn't know at the time that this is the essence of the entrepreneur.
trekking into the wilderness to study wild wolves!), i was anxious for my own children to displaysome kind of steady interest.
we may manage to mold and shape them to some extent, but the fact remains that they have free will.
as a first step toward a more satisfying holiday season, i purchased copies of "unplug the christmas machine" and "new traditions," books that helped my family define how we do want to celebrate.
anyone can learn something new, at any age.
yet no well-meaning relative quizzes our children on the value of the dollar against the euro; they just ask goofy questions about multiplication tables.
the trainer that we are taking classes from said lab mix, part rottweiler, and the mystery of "what is sophie" is taking us to tons of information and on a real life learning experience and a critical thinking extravaganza.
i had an intellectual understanding of free-market economics in college, and when i started working, seeing this in action was a wonderful confirmation.
while we certainly are prepared to spend a certain amount of time with our children, helping them with their learning activities, we are thrilled when the kids take off and run with their studies because they want to learn more, because they are excited about the project,or the topic at hand.
we don't have to provide a perfect environment for our kids to learn in, or have a degree, if we can provide a love for books and reading, and model a thirst for knowledge.
we are creating our own personal goals and living them out, and we are empowered by our own independence to change our direction and our goals when they no longer serve us.
i felt grateful that my children were not into baseball, especially to that degree.
children are self-directed whenever they decide what they need or want to learn, set their own goals, identify and find resources for learning, choose and use strategies for learning, or evaluate their own learning." as teachers, mentors, and homeschooling parents, we can encourage and develop self-direction in children by including them in planning their learning experiences, having them choose materials they will use, and understanding their learning style so we can support them along their learning journey.
another scenario: when you tell your kids to sink or swim with expenses, they sink.
my uncle told me when i was pregnant with #1 that children aren’t blank slates that we can write on and have them turn out like we want them to.
students can be self-directed in several ways and in different degrees.
seeing freedom anew through her eyes heightened my commitment to participating fully in the system that makes so much achievement and wealth possible here in this country.
we are testing out behavior modification theory and taking note of dog and people psychology.

the “reciprocity guilt” bothered me at first, but eased as i saw the effects of standing my ground, watching the material tide ebb.
most schooled children blindly enter college because it is what is expected of them.
they appreciate that the holiday season no longer brings stress and strain to our home, right through to the gift aftermath and emotional letdown.
so, i’m getting my financial house in order.
no one blog, not even this lwos blog, can possibly represent the opinions and lives of all who live life without school.
thus, we determined that certain expenses were not rights of being a child in our family, but that children were responsible for them.
just as important is my desire to model “the entrepreneurial mind” for my children, which will serve them well no matter where their future endeavors will take them.
things that have meaning for them, and make sense for what works for their brains and spirits.
the ocean and animals are deep-seated interests of my daughter jacinta.
this is something homeschoolers can do to help their kids who experience later readiness levels; teach them the same things in a different way.
if we were lucky enough to have financially astute parents, then maybe we got that knowledge passed to us, but the vast majority of us didn’t.
that's why i don't stress about them learning or their future.
while andrew johnson had to work out of sheer necessity, our kids have had life pretty easy, but are required to to work to do and have some of the things their peers have had handed to them.
most schooled children blindly enter college because it is what is expected of them.
no one drops by issues offorbes ormoney or the wall street journal the way they hand over workbooks and readers.
what i'm understanding is that i don't get to define or own any of my children's successes or failures.
we learned how new mexico became a state and jacinta sewed herself clothes just like josefina's.
also, i will confess, i am personally motivated by my love of free markets and capitalism.
to my surprise, we came out a bit ahead, financially, because i was able to keep up with much of my work while saving on the cost of the school.
;-) self-directed learners don't have to be dropped into a chasm of parental indifference or disinterest; on the contrary, it's really just a paradigm shift from parent-directed to parent-supported education.
madison and ella are exposed in an immediate way to how i interact with clients, and they see how hard i work to create value in a few different marketplaces.
it emphasizes trust in the universe that things happen the way they do because that's how things are meant to be.
you may house their bodies but not their souls, for their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.”
by spending time working one-on-one with your child, getting to know the way your child learns so you can make their learning program fit, and planning learning experiences to fit your child, you can give them that extra boost that they need to excel.
we can also intentionally plan projects and learning experiences to build on a known interest.
during those early years, i spent a lot of time and money buying every imaginable educational tool to support my daughters’ vague leanings.
the sons of a friend displayed early and avid interest in baseball.
i worry less, and trust that my kids will learn what they need to in order to attain their goals.
like a friend once noted about her family’s celebration, we “could not see the christmas tree for the trash around it.”
that was right at the time i was establishing axton enterprises, so i was able to design my business from the very start to accommodate my being involved with my kids.
you can’t nclb it, and if you tried, you would basically destroy it.
the fact that i loved my work meant that i did not want to give it up completely in order to educate the kids; fortunately, today’s technology makes that unnecessary.
to peek in on her day to day lifestyle, you can check out her blog,apple stars.
and, if we teach our children how to learn, they will naturally gravitate towards the things that they “get” and enjoy, which i think is also an important skill – knowing what our purpose is by understanding who we are, what we like, and what we’re good at.
;-)  self-directed learners don't have to be dropped into a chasm of parental indifference or disinterest; on the contrary, it's really just a paradigm shift from parent-directed to parent-supported education.
rather than focus on what they can't do or haven't learned, figure out how to help them use the skills they have now, and once they've developed some self-confidence, you can build on that.
we can also intentionally plan projects and learning experiences to build on a known interest.
we learned how new mexico became a state and jacinta sewed herself clothes just like josefina's.
so even before the girls were born, i designed my businesses to be run from home so that i could be the one to educate them.
and likewise, homeschooling parents are overjoyed when their child gets to work of their own volition.
while i personally don’t know any homeschooled kids who have turned out so terribly bad, it stands to reason that with homeschooling families being a microcosm of our society in general, and individuals having free will, some homeschooled adults will choose things that go totally against the way they were raised.
the “reciprocity guilt” bothered me at first, but eased as i saw the effects of standing my ground, watching the material tide ebb.
i was able to get online teachers' guides at pbs.org/masterpiece.
he just didn't let anyone tell him that he had to be young, prepared or even smart to do it.
i understood how it worked because it made sense to me.

both of my children are avid readers and writers, keeping daily journals, corresponding with several pen pals, creating mock movie trailers in powerpoint, editing my writing, and making regular requests to go to the library for yet more books.
we have these cringes built-in about finance, yet the majority of us received little to no financial education.
they know that i view their education as the most important of my three jobs, but they also see how much it means to me to be able to do my own work.
he didn't learn to read until his wife taught him at the age of 18.

i release my judgments and my ownership while i continue to support and counsel eric on his journey through life to joy.
eric is showing me that he will need time to figure out what he wants to do and how he wants to do it.
so, i don't focus on the "what" that my children study and learn.
but remember, although we can try to duplicate some of the common threads of the lives of famous homeschoolers, the most important lesson we can impart to our children is that it's important that they know who they are and develop who they are.
we are testing out behavior modification theory and taking note of dog and people psychology.
andrew johnson was poor; his family couldn't afford schooling and he never had a day's schooling in his life.
we can model lifelong learning as we research homeschooling, educational methods, and things that intrigue us or our children.
even kids with some identified learning disabilities have been found to thrive in a homeschooling environment.
i recall one very young boy bringing aduplo bricks board to his mother, on which he had placed bricks to make two squares abutting each other.
they know that i view their education as the most important of my three jobs, but they also see how much it means to me to be able to do my own work.

i think it’s a fallacy for parents (homeschooling or not) to take credit for our adult children’s successes or failures.
i worked out of the home, even before it became popular to do so.
even if you can't travel abroad, there are enough places right within driving distance of most of our homes, to keep us all busy for a few years.
i recall one very young boy bringing aduplo bricks board to his mother, on which he had placed bricks to make two squares abutting each other.

we are living those teachable moments by living our lives and learning as we go.
my brain and language have always been good companions.
as a first step toward a more satisfying holiday season, i purchased copies of "unplug the christmas machine" and "new traditions," books that helped my family define how we do want to celebrate.
they enjoy the learning.
i was so desperate for them to have something with which to identify that i might have even breathed a sigh of relief had they chosen baseball.
i have always determined that my children would have the best education possible so that they will, in turn, be able to find their own dream jobs someday.
but having four children (three grown and one sixteen), i can affirm that they aren’t blank slates when they are born.
it's amazing how much more readily kids will learn when they are interested in the subject, as opposed to learning the same topic when it's our idea.
so long as they are studying something, i know they will succeed.
it emphasizes trust in the universe that things happen the way they do because that's how things are meant to be.
adapting to our circumstance is also an important element.
they can disregard our teachings totally some day.
this past november 2006, my children were (and still are) learning about dogs because we just brought our new dog, sophie, home to be in our family.
one of several things will result:  a small percentage will discover they love it and find what they really want to do with their life; the greater majority will either continue to pursue what is expected of them and later discover they hate their life or they will flit through their college experience and land in something they may or may not like.
we noted that the number one thing that makes the season special for us is spending time with loved ones.
my uncle told me when i was pregnant with #1 that children aren’t blank slates that we can write on and have them turn out like we want them to.
the learning itself isworth it because it is relevant, wanted and needed.
no matter what specific facts or skills we teach them, so long as they have the ability and confidence to learn, they are prepared for any path they choose.
from our past american girl excursion to our more recent magic tree house adventures (we plunder the library for myths and legends, stories, poetry, cooking and craft books, and informational books and dive into the culture and time) to visits to local living museums and working historical farms in character (my children like to dress up and participate) to travels from the beginning of time (my children are into early human and the evolution of humans and animals big time) to making history today by voting, meeting the governor of our state and making the world a better place today as we see it (my children are into protecting animals and making sure they do not go extinct), we are “covering” and making history.
i wanted to have financial independence just as a matter of principle.
while we certainly are prepared to spend a certain amount of time with our children, helping them with their learning activities, we are thrilled when the kids take off and run with their studies because they want to learn more, because they are excited about the project,or the topic at hand.
while pointing out that many kids aren't ready for intense academic instruction at an early age, he also suggests that children are ripe for learning at any age.
too many children have the mistaken impression that we only learn to get a certain grade or for a certain class.
when they were babies, i had a business-hours nanny watch them there with me in the house.
even though at the time i did not consider the possibility of a career in business, i thought i could somehow use the developing technology to design a career that would give me the best work-life balance possible.
bad finances and lack of financial knowledge create a level of underlying tension that i believe gets in the way of both good modeling and good parenting.

with his earnings, at 18 he fulfilled an adolescent goal of living in japan with a host family for two months.
therefore, eric set his sites on preparing himself for serving a two year mission for our church.
people pounce on unschoolers and homeschoolers about teaching reading, writing, math, and science, but in terms of being prepared to lead a comfortable life, finance education is probably one of the most important topics to cover.
another year, we explored the traditions of her birth country and had a korean birthday party.
and likewise, homeschooling parents are overjoyed when their child gets to work of their own volition.
this is a wonderful healing thing to do no matter what age our kids . . .
gift giving did not disappear, but we downplay the focus on material things.

this last time he turned to architecture, and he's really good at it - despite being a car repairman until he was in his 40's.
i was determined to have the time and flexibility to make sure my future children would have the visibility and guidance from me that i had lacked from my own parents.
hopefully, when i do that, the world is a better place - no matter what name i give it.
while working through my own finance baggage, i realized that scott's gap exists every bit as much for money as it does for parenting.
and if that's the case, they will pick it up fast.
we also like doing a few simple and meaningful things together, like baking one or two kinds of heirloom cookies to give to friends and neighbors, taking walks to see the lights at night, and decorating simply, with candles, evergreen branches, and a small tree.
nobody “prepared” me to learn foreign language.
and likewise, when our kids (adults, but yes, still our kids, in our hearts) choose horribly and end up in the ditch and either don’t choose to or find themselves unable to crawl back out again, we really shouldn’t beat ourselves up for it.
indeed, one of the best things about unplugging the holidays is being emancipated from standing in the department store’s return line on december 26th.

i relished the feel of sun and breeze, knowing it will not be long before winter's glum visage stares us down for seemingly endless months.
if they aren't writers, perhaps they are talkers and can dictate their thoughts and impressions to you or a tape player, or draw pictures which you can help them caption until the time comes that they can do it for themselves.

i read with great interest stories of homeschooled or self-taught people, trying to find clues that would help me guide my children in a way that would result in them becoming self-directed.
many of my friends, as adults, have either changed their careers, or learned new things very well to get a job, or just for their own interest.
also, i will confess, i am personally motivated by my love of free markets and capitalism.
;-) i realized later that perhaps my reading, note-taking, conversation, and the resulting free-lance articles, were as valuable in developing a love of learning in my children as anything i learned during my research.

while i personally don’t know any homeschooled kids who have turned out so terribly bad, it stands to reason that with homeschooling families being a microcosm of our society in general, and individuals having free will, some homeschooled adults will choose things that go totally against the way they were raised.

from our past american girl excursion to our more recent magic tree house adventures (we plunder the library for myths and legends, stories, poetry, cooking and craft books, and informational books and dive into the culture and time) to visits to local living  museums and working historical farms in character (my children like to dress up and participate) to travels from the beginning of time (my children are into early human and the evolution of humans and animals big time) to making history today by voting, meeting the governor of our state and making the world a better place today as we see it (my children are into protecting animals and making sure they do not go extinct), we are “covering” and making history.

instead, we are serenely enjoying not mall hopping, not lining up with the unhappy multitudes, not being constantly barraged with the same music ad nauseum, not worrying about finding “just the right gift” for the person who already has more than enough,not worrying about how much to spend on whom,not wondering if the children’s concept of the reason for the season is a glut of new stuff,not worrying how we will find room for a flood of new belongings, not stressing over how to pay for it all, and notplanning to get up early the day after christmas to stand in line with packs of other people who are glumly returning the junk they didn't want or need.

one of several things will result: a small percentage will discover they love it and find what they really want to do with their life; the greater majority will either continue to pursue what is expected of them and later discover they hate their life or they will flit through their college experience and land in something they may or may not like.
