———————————– hey benny, i found this summary (http://www.zompist.com/whylang.html) of why typical kids learn languages easier than typical adults, which doesn’t get into fmri research about the brains of kids under 5: “innate abilities aside, children have a number of powerful advantages: 1)
just keep in mind that i’ll delete any comments that: 1.
their motivation is intense.
millions of adults around the world learn  languages to excellent levels fine all the time.
when they did,  surprise surprise,adults come out on top.
seriously ted, you need to get me to speak up on one of your stages so i  can undo the damage of this previous talker, as well as destroy people’s  own misconceptions.
just keep in mind that i’ll delete any comments  that: 1.
any sloppy research that comes up on this is arguing against an army of people that disprove it.
when they did, surprise surprise,adults come out on top.

i forget where the drunk blind man threw the dart that we have been basing this on) and consideringi myself started properly at age 21, and how many people have been sharing their own success stories with me (if you have one, make sure to share it with all of us in the fi3m forum’s success stories section – the best ones will get showcased on the blog!)
i hope to have the ammunition to destroy this pointless demotivator.
adults rarely have to spend much of their time in the company of people they need to talk to but can’t; children can get very little of what they want without learning language(s).3)
in some cases, it’s harder and takes a wee bit  more time, but it’s definitely not impossible.
can’t  wait to see what you have to write… don’t be shy!!

the most discouraging ted talk ever i’ve had some frustration with some linguists in the past when they  make remarks that they can’t back up withrelevant research, which serve no purpose but todiscourage learners.
this stuff really pisses me off as the “research” tests in a  context and environment thatchildren are bound to win on anyway (such as traditional classroom learning) and doesn’t test in areas that  adults would be better at.
i realize that you don’t like to put yourself in  situations like number 3, but living in a foreign country, i find that even as  an adult, i get #3 from time to time.
let me know your thoughts on this in the comments!
i can’t  imagine how many people were on the fence, but saw a video like this or read  some paper where kids came out on top… in classroom learning, and  decided from that to give up, even though they have many many advantages the  kids don’t.
as far as i’m concerned this is totally irrelevant research,as well as being unhelpful.
they can devote almost their full time to it.
after some focused training, and sometimeseven just a few seconds of paying attention, and you’ll hear it.
your own adventures are examples of the first two points.
are unnecessarily nasty and mean to me or any other commenter or  otherwise totally inappropriate.

their peers are nastier.
but when they get taken seriously by the public, then i have to take a stand against it.
embarrassment is a prime motivating factor for human beings (i owe this insight to marvin minsky’s the society of mind, but it was most memorably expressed by david berlinski (in black mischief, p. 129), who noted that of all emotions, from rage to depression to first love, only embarrassment can recur, decades later, with its full original intensity).

there is a stupid rumour going around that you can’t learn a language after a certain age (was it 6, or 12, or 14?
she also claims that age one is where we can can no longer distinguish foreign sounds any more; “you and i can’t do that… we can discriminate the sounds of our own language, but not those of foreign languages”.
i love reading them you don’t even have  to write in english!

so maybe you can use this to turn the subject on its head and show adults, who want to learn other languages, why they too can learn as easy as kids.

among the worst examples include an otherwise interesting ted talk about the linguistic genius of babies – in it she shows us a bullshit graph about the “critical period” for learning a language where all hope is lostfrom age 17.

fortunately this is not the case for all linguists, and now popular research is backing up what i’ve been saying all along!
