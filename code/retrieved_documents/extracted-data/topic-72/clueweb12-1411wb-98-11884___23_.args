a strategic investment by the department could make an extremely powerful contribution to the k-12 educational landscape and would be a powerful lever toward ensuring that all students had access to top-quality, engaging learning materials.federal provision of these textbooks would free states and school districts to spend funds on laptops, classroom-level high-speed wireless connectivity, and other technologies necessary to ensure the global competitiveness of our students in the decades to come.added time for professional development, with proper supervision and accountability, would improve teacher quality.teachers can be freed from their tradition-bound classroom roles, employed in more differentiated and productive ways, and offered new career paths.many online courses also allow students to proceed at their own pace; collaborate with students from other schools or countries; and/or incorporate digital technologies into their learning.many online courses also allow students to proceed at their own pace; collaborate with students from other schools or countries; and/or incorporate digital technologies into their learning.for many school districts, online courses are the only way to provide high-level classes such as advanced placement, foreign language, advanced science or math, and other courses.for many school districts, online courses are the only way to provide high-level classes such as advanced placement, foreign language, advanced science or math, and other courses.other districts are finding that online coursework can be an excellent option for at-risk students or credit recovery; for homebound, incarcerated, or home-schooled students; or for meeting the needs of students who simply may not be successful in a more traditional classroom environment.going forward, learning may be far more individualized, far more in the hands (and the minds) of the learner, and far more interactive than ever before.precisely because technology promises to transform the core components of schooling, it is inevitably disruptive to the jobs, routines, and resources of the people whose livelihoods derive from the existing system.all textbook material would be free and openly accessible to our nation’s k-12 students and educators.meta-analyses of existing research show that student achievement in face-to-face and online courses is approximately equivalent.students and parents value the flexibility, accessibility, and convenience of online coursework.and all of this promotes solidarity, which is critical to the unions’ ability to attract members, gain their financial and emotional support, and mobilize them for economic and political ends.
