we help people in the underclass rise economically by teaching them how to communicate effectively beyond a narrow social sphere, and that can only be accomplished by teaching them shared, traditional literacy culture.they want to ensure that the school provides their children with discourse patterns, interreactional styles and spoken and written language codes that will allow them success in the larger society.broad and rich curricula like core knowledge would actually allow educators to improve test scores above and beyond a narrow test-prep curriculum.this patient, coherent investment in background knowledge—so critical to success yet so often missing from language arts instruction—needs to be nurtured and grown for the entirety of a child’s time in school.students taught with an explicit, systematic phonics approach in the early grades should be able to master all the decoding skills they need.our students should be ready to academically handle the rigors of collegiate life, particularly since a large minority of our students will be attending selective or highly-selective universities.the only way to raise achievement and to narrow gaps is through a slow and steady investment in the vocabulary and knowledge that are the prerequisites of language growth and competence.they usually come to school on day one with smaller vocabularies and less background knowledge of the world than more advantaged kids, who tend to hear more rich and complex language at home and enjoy more opportunities for language and knowledge enrichment.the high stakes associated with reading tests may not preclude teaching a knowledge-rich curriculum, but it arguably disincentivizes it.if we wait until a child can read independently to build background knowledge and vocabulary, we are almost certainly cementing their knowledge and language deficits permanently in place.we only make social and economic progress by teaching everybody to read and communicate, which means teaching myths and facts that are predominantly traditional.their love of tejano music or their knowledge of the urban, ethnically diverse and youthful language that pervades their culture is important and it is a travesty of reality that their experiences are not considered part of the mainstream language of cultural literacy.readalouds not only grow vocabulary, they are the best way to build critical background knowledge, which is essential for later reading comprehension.traditionally educated themselves, and highly literate, these self-appointed protectors of minority cultures have advised schools to pursue a course that has condemned minorities to illiteracy.his pivot is important and it is one i recognize as vital to the project of educating students from environments that aren’t middle class or white, particularly as i educate them for a future where hopefully, because of their educational credentials, they have to engage and be a part of that world.
