he will then oppose the use of linux at his company, or in other situations where it would actually work well and be an improvement.
the figure to the right shows the the value of certain operating systems as a function of the proficiency of the user.
the microsoft corporation is in the business of selling software.
remember that while red hat would love for linux to be as easy to use as possible, they are limited in what they can achieve.
this means that the products the company makes will have coherent priorities and objectives, determined by market research, the company's long-term plan, or managers' priviate political agendas.
at these companies, there are professional managers who decide how things are going to be, and the actual programmers are compelled to implement things in this fashion.
if you can't type without looking, frustration lies ahead.
if you expect your computer to have a learning curve like your toaster, or you just want to "get on the internet" and "do your email", you would have to be insane to try linux.
the non-programmer end users will never contribute anything back to the original author, but the programmer may.
it was originally developed by at&t, which was very muchnot in the business of selling software - in fact, they were legally not allowed to sell software (see one of the unix history links above for details).
if you're interested in the history of unix, you can readthis unix history from dennis ritchie, or this history of unix, linux, and gnu.
linux does more good than something like microsoft windows for an expert, but it does considerably less for a non-expert.
it doesn't matter if it would be harder for you to do work on your computer, because you'renot doing any work on your computer.
linux, on the other hand, consists of components largely developed by volunteers.
it's set up so that you can do things quickly once you've learned, but you won't be able to do thingsat all before you've put some time into figuring out what's going on.
this is linux linux is not unix, but it operates in a similar fashion, with the same fundamental constructs, and even commands which mostly have the same names and take compatible options.
- incompetent users drain linux's resources - incompetent users never read the documentation before they ask for help, and they ask for help with the stupidest and most trivial problems.
they were primarilyusers of the software.
a linux computer, properly installed and configured, would stay up for months and be down 0.1% of the time.
if your watch alarm goes off at the same time each day, and you can't figure out how to turn it off, linux is not for you.
beacuse these people are not being paid to work on linux, they cannot be compelled to do things in any way they do not like, as there is nothing with which they can be threatened.
by all means, recommend linux to people who have already demonstrated an inclination to learn, and are feeling limited by their current environment.
well, of course they do - it's in their best interest to sell as many copies as possible.
this wastes the developers' time.
well, of course they do - it's in their best interest to sell as many copies as possible.
thus, they do not need to sell the component to get value from it - they get value from using it themselves.
however, they do not manufactur the transistors and capacitors themselves - they obtain them from outside.
the only sort of reward authors ever get is receiving improvements to the things they have written.
this is the fundamental reason that linux differs so much from proprietary operating systems.
thus, they do not need to sell the component to get value from it - they get value from using it themselves.
this is time which the developer would otherwise have spent making the software better, for the sake of assisting incompetent users who will never contribute anything useful.
in the case of linux, the distributor has no pull with the authors because they aren't paying the authors at all!
with linux, most customers are wrong as discussed above, some linux distributions which sell their product want to keep their customers happy, and want to appeal to as many customers as possible.
the figure to the right shows the the value of certain operating systems as a function of the proficiency of the user.
they cannot cause fundamental changes to most of the components in the distribution.
unix-like operating systems were generally found to be better, having advantages such as higher reliability and lower cost.
even if the developer isn't going to reply to the email, time is still required to wade through it and sort it out from the important stuff.
in the case of electronics manufacturers, the kit supplier has little pull because the quantities they buy are so small.
the system administrators generally know enough about what they're doing that linux would be advantageous for them.
if it is improved upon by others, the original author can then use the improved version and obtain extra utility without having put in the effort to improve it himself.
if you cannot reset the time on your vcr when there is a power failure, you are not proficient enough to use linux.
he will then oppose the use of linux at his company, or in other situations where it would actually work well and be an improvement.
this is linux linux is not unix, but it operates in a similar fashion, with the same fundamental constructs, and even commands which mostly have the same names and take compatible options.
this means, of course, that they design it to operate in a way that they would like to use.
this page most recently modified on: monday, 28-jan-2002 01:45:13 est - a company with professional system administrators - the system administrators generally know enough about what they're doing that linux would be advantageous for them.
thus, i'll attempt to describe linux by comparing it to modern pc operating systems like microsft windows and macos.
however, they do not manufactur the transistors and capacitors themselves - they obtain them from outside.
because these people are, by definition, programmers, most of the software is tailored to be used by someone as technically proficient as a programmer.
this means, of course, that they design it to operate in a way that they would like to use.
while i wouldn't call it lying, it's definitely marketing, and needs to be taken with a large heap of salt.
a linux computer, properly installed and configured, would stay up for months and be down 0.1% of the time.
furthermore, because their value is derived from the use of it, it is in their best interests to allow other people to improve upon it.
furthermore, because most linux authors receive no compensation whatsoever from an additional user using their software, there is no incentive for them to make it easier for non-technical people to use.
linux does more good than something like microsoft windows for an expert, but it does considerably less for a non-expert.
the more advanced and enterprising ones have custom circuit boards printed.
if they haven't learned enough to feel limited, however, it is counterproductive to recommend they move to something harder.
it will be equally easy for you, and easier for your friend who does the real work on your computer.
one of the largest advantages of linux is the availability of source code, which allows you to modify programs to suit your taste... assuming you know how.
- you will not obtain the advantages for which linux is famous - there have been some famous papers written comparing unix-like operating systems, including linux, to microsoft windows.
thus, the authors have no incentive whatsoever to work to increase the number of copies sold, or the number of users.
of course, it also hurts your personal reputation if people follow your advice and have a horrible experience.
if you have sticky notes attached to your monitor reminding you the exact steps to perform certain tasks, changing to linux will require you to simply replace your sticky notes with different instructions.
specifically, there are some lies being told to try to get windows or mac users to switch to linux.
if you can't type without looking, frustration lies ahead.
this means that when microsoft decides that configuration is going to be done primarily via the graphical interface, the programmers can either implement configuration via the graphical interface or start collecting unemployment.
this means it also comes with source code, which means that you can modify it to make a custom version, something that is not possible (and is actually illegal even when it is technically possible) with proprietary software such as microsoft windows.
the company draws up instructions, and packages components which are suitable for a particular purpose.
they cannot cause fundamental changes to most of the components in the distribution.
however, they money they get stays with the distributor, and never reaches most of the initial authors.
this means that the products the company makes will have coherent priorities and objectives, determined by market research, the company's long-term plan, or managers' priviate political agendas.
however, a home user who tries linux and is unsuccessful with it will not come away from the experience thinking "i'm too dumb to use linux", he will come away from the experience thinking "linux is crap!"
if you have sticky notes attached to your monitor reminding you the exact steps to perform certain tasks, changing to linux will require you to simply replace your sticky notes with different instructions.
this wastes the developers' time.
if red hat decides that a certain fundamental change is going to be required to make the software easier to use, programmer jim who works on linux for free is going to say "bite me", and go about things exactly the way he was before.
it is likely to be intimidating to someone with less skill.
- incompetent users hurt linux's reputation - there are many things for which linux works well, although general home use is not among them.
it will be equally easy for you, and easier for your friend who does the real work on your computer.
thus, i'll attempt to describe linux by comparing it to modern pc operating systems like microsft windows and macos.
if reading c is like reading swahili to you, there's no advantage whatsoever in having the source code, because you don't know what to do with it anyway.

please go home now just as it's usually not to the advantage of a new user to use linux, it's not to linux's advantage either.
now that i've discussed the nature of linux, i'll explain why it's probably not the right solution for home use by an average person.
there is a point on the figure at which linux becomes more valuable than alternatives; use linux if your proficiency exceeds this amount.
however, you will not be able to properly install and configure a linux server - soyour linux computer will never reboot, because it never runs at all, and it will be down 100% of the time!

furthermore, the kit manufacturer has little control over the specifications of the parts they buy - if they would like some small change in a component to make it integrate better into their project, they are not guaranteed to be able to get this change from the manufacturer.
using an environment such as linux will not encourage people to learn, because if they are not already inclined to learn and be curious, they will never notice any of the important differences between linux and windows!
they will never be able to achieve the same level of success as microsoft or apple, however, because they cannot mandate changes to the underlying functionality to support ease-of-use like microsoft and apple can.
this means that when microsoft decides that configuration is going to be done primarily via the graphical interface, the programmers can either implement configuration via the graphical interface or start collecting unemployment.
