in contrast, linux exploits are generally more limited in scope, and more likely to lend themselves to insider attacks, petreley suggested.also during the session, nicholas petreley, an analyst and consultant at evans data, contended that regardless of the numbers of exploits per platform, windows exploits are often much more severe.citing materials produced by microsoft itself, petreley said that many of the growing population of worms targeting windows let outside hackers "completely take over" a server.in fact, some database and accounting apps have actually taken performance hits from the advent of the windows gui.hall reasoned that, as a result, no operating system -- not even linux -- should totally dominate any market.one linux exploit, for instance, permits information in firebird servers to be overwritten.to gain more traction on the desktop, linux needs a better gui, he insisted.jon "maddog" hall, president and executive director of linux international, pointed to third-party tools, available from vendors such as ibm and computer associates (ca), for managing linux along with mvs and unix, for example."(administrative) controls are a lot better (in windows)," ivens asserted, citing printer set-up as one example.hall said that he'll be more than happy if linux ultimately captures 30 percent of the desktop space.on an overall basis, linux applications still lack the "fit and finish" of windows apps, minasi charged.many users don't know how tricky windows can be to install, since windows still comes pre-installed on most pcs, members of the cebit audience were told.openoffice and its derivatives lack some of the features of microsoft office, according to mark minasi, a writer and consultant petreley, though, argued that ei (evermore integrated) office, an office suite from evermore software, contains a similar feature set to microsoft office.one rather obvious reason is that some font creators charge for the fonts, according to hall.newsletters internet.cominternet.com cacti makes device monitoring simple unix / linux:
