furthermore, windows-based systems were found to be far more resilient than linux-based systems during the iraq war months, from march to may 2003, the report says, a time of increased hacking activity.windows isn't perfect, but the object based dacl security model implemented in nt is superior to simpler rights based model used in linux.percentage-wise, over 75 percent of all server-based breaches occurred on linux systems during this time period, while windows systems were responsible for just 15 percent of breaches.people talking about the merits of windows can bring out facts, figures, and explain why thinking windows is inherently insecure is a misconception.sci is going to force the linux thieves to regurgitate all the code they have been stealing from unix over the years.it supports my theory that most windows administrators are simpletons who know little of computer systems, network security and administration or much beyond the most basic of concepts in the it world.please do not post comments that contain any of the following: - foul language, flaming or personal attacks - links to illegal software downloads or product keys, or requests for them - or any other harmful posts wininsider staff reserves the right to delete such messages and ban users without notice.in administration it is much easier to use windows ad to setup a network in a distributed solution than linux.the issue you think you are referring to is that applications with display objects (such as a window or system tray icon) that are owned by an interactive process will receive input from a process running in another security context.in other words, everything i've been saying about windows, linux and security was not only true, but evolving in a wonderfully predictable way.the ?linux community? has always operated like they were a law unto themselves, and basically has felt free to operate within their own self-made laws, including stealing anyone?s intellectual property whenever the mood strikes them.here in the real world linux is only grabbing a share of a shrinking 'nix market.anyone who as much as raised the slightest objection to being robed of their intellectual property was immediately viciously attacked from all angles by the linux propaganda machine, using lies, disinformation and methods that would make even hitler blush!the fact is, linux security is a myth created by people who have an intellectual investment in propagating the myth of "'nix" superiority, just as netware folks try do with their platform.plus of course there are far more attacks on windows servers than any other systems on the planet; with most of the attacks against windows servers initiated, organized and carried out by microsoft hating, rabid, hateful, linux fundamentalists and fanatics!!
