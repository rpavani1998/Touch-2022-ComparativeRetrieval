multi booting can also aid software developers where multiple operating systems are required for development or testing purposes.having these systems on one machine can greatly reduce hardware costs.a multi boot configuration will allow a user to use all of this software on one computer.multi booting allows one to get to know the new system, configure all applications needed and migrate data before making the final step and removing the old operating system.it is often difficult to use only linux, because one normally has to work in windows based lans, interact with other windows or linux users or just because one is too lazy to learn new applications instead of those normally used in a windows environment.with gnu/linux, you are in general connect as a user to restricted access, and you pass as a root (i.e. administrator under windows) when you must change important parameters of the system or regulate the hardware configuration or add or remove a program.multi booting is useful in many situations, such as those where several pieces of software require different operating systems and cannot be run on a single system.this allows you to actually work with linux to run programs and learn linux commands.with this solution you can safeguard the remainder of your personal and software data on a second partition.the solution proposed above allows a much better usage of the computer resources and time.it will be necessary to learn from new software, a new interface, with a new manner of making.the win4linpro environment is surely much better integrated with linux than a native windows installation and you will have at your disposal the power of linux and windows applications without any need to reboot.this approach has a few disadvantages as follows: i concluded that there should have been a better way to use my pc and i looked for a solution to access both linux and windows applications without rebooting.the new version allows windows to connect to almost any type of ethernet network from regular internet access to active directory authentication, and anything in between.also, as a linux system administrator, you will also need to manage (create, delete, and modify) partitions on existing linux systems (after the os has been installed).
