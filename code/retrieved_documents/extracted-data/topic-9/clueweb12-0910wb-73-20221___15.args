my main machine that i use right now i play games on some native others with the aid of wine and cedega.
i am not anti linux, i use linux and work day to day on a unix/bsd os (aka os x).
linux is the house which you have to build yourself, but make it roofless or perhaps underwater if you like to.
change it in any place from the top to the bottom, and see how it works on any level.
i'd like to echo yuri's comments and add the following, my primary machine is a laptop at home and at workand i'd love to challenge anyone to show me a linux laptop functioning on a wpa2 psk wireless network.
october 29, 2006 3:15 pm @dima um, you got that wrong, it goes like this: "linux is ready for the desktop, as long as you don't have 10 years of windows experience.
doesn't mean os x isn't ready for the desktop.
but at least its a vast improvement on command line operating system, man that went out in the 60's, get with the times guyes.
the linus gui (the kde and the gnome,etc..) are very beautiful and very fast to be loaded than the slowly gui of the windows os, but the console settings is kinda complex and need alot of time to make the people get used to it (the shell commands in my viw is hard to memorize and sux)
my biggest problem was inability to use the ide cd-rom drive, because that kernel didn't support it.
so i copied this tutorial word for word, editing in the terminal with copy and paste for 100% certainty, and i also made a back-up etc, all in the terminal...
and photoshop runs ok under wine, plus if you can afford photoshop you can afford windows + a good firewall and antivirus and you probably have no need for linux.
well, in windows every possible display is displayed in the control panel, and it is easy and fast to adjust the screen resolution.
after ten years, i'm still using the same window manager--icewm--because i can configure it in a way that's convenient forme , not for the average joe that microsoft interface designers have in mind.
at the moment, linux does everything i need it to do, without the added windows hassle.
you don't need them to go to australia, so nobody needs them.
2)windows is just as flexible as linux for experts 3) windows desktop has dozens of times more apps for it than linux.
i use mandriva linux powerpack, which i happily pay for.

a "we-tuned-it-for-you" software, with (mostly) good defaults and an easy learning curve, but with a severily limited capability to change anything or to see how things are working behind the curtain (like a black box).
windows has more options and tunables, linux comes preconfigured with a lot of "default" settings.
october 29, 2006 1:08 pm naaa, it is not ready.
i got a nice baseball cap from novell on linuxworld san francisco, which says "your desktop is ready."
windows is unsuitable for many linux users as it fails to provide the flexibility they require.
when you buy a pc and windows is already installed most users will use it.
connect to the internet wirelessly.
but guess what, i had an x display problem on next log-in, no gui.
you forget we mere humans do not care for a cli and want easy app/package installation.
for example i recently installed ubuntu 6.05 on my pc.
me, i just want to change my screen resolution, not waste half a day of my life finding out, trawling through inadequate documentation, searching on various forums and reading through stupidly in depth tutorials, how to alter the inner workings of a text file on linux in the terminal.
linux guys, really have to get over this "desktop" thing.
recent additions to linux desktop includes nice visual effects, similar to those in latest mac os x and windows vista.
as a solution for them, even the easiest current free linux distros like freespire are too unfriendly for the average, 100 iq windows user.
in this case, truth is very subjective.
this is the one thing that windows has, a layer of ease of use.
most things worked great except i was really annoyed by the fact the only resolution i could get was 1024x786, where i had a display capable of 1600x1200.
when i install linux onto a computer, i boot it for the first time and am welcomed with a fully functional desktop.
most of the commenters here have completely missed the point.
linux was more of a diy, a lego style--stick the pieces together and you get what you want if you have enough construction skills.
i mean comeon, there is a learning curve to anything to do with computers, why should we continue "making it easier" rather than "making it better".
linux can be great yes, but needs to evolve more before it can replace windows.
does this mean you gain an understanding of the inner working of your os, that through painful discovery you understand how your os works, how it was built, how it can be altered in nigh on impossible ways compared to windows, yes.
i remember using x window, icewm as a window manager, netscape for local intranet and email, and of course terminal, vim, and midnight commander.
this is not a general linux problem, it is probably just specific to ubuntu 6.05 and my specific hardware configuration (i did not have this problem with suse and fedora for example, but they in turn had other, more serious problems requiring the terminal).
give linux a few years in this area and use it for hobby projects.
i remember using x window, icewm as a window manager, netscape for local intranet and email, and of course terminal, vim, and midnight commander.
well in my opinion linux still need a long time to pass till it will be ready for the desktop computers, because : 1.
it would be necessary to run two operating system, and i would have to switch to windows everytime i needed to do any real work.
in short--the situation is always improving, and currently pretty much every app i need is available for my platform of choice.
windows is easy, you do not have to have esoteric knowledge of command lines to discover the ideal screen resolution.
i had to rewrite the x display in terminal and my lack of knowledge messed everything up (i was following a tutorial specific to my distribution and version number, and specific to my problem word for word with copy and paste from web browser).
i also use gnucash for my personal finances which is just as powerful as quickbooks.
ok, so i checked on the internet to see if this a common problem with an easy solution, and wow, i found an article named something like 'easy way to increase resolution on ubuntu 6.05'.
while i do agree with most of what the writer says, i definitely would like people to stop beating the dead horse.
my mum can change the screen resolution in windows, but not in ubuntu which requires the terminal.
i've dabbled with various linux distros for a couple years, and the main reason i keep ending up back on the m$ teat is the lack of apps/packages i like for linux.
i think most of the people want a gui that work as the shell command (like the control panel in the windows for better access and beautiful icons,etc,,,) 3.
november 28, 2006 7:08 pm ofcourse linux is ready for the desktop, it just depends on your level of expertise, and your technical requirements.
is the same question, you'll get lots of people saying a 1960 hillman is "ready for the road".
walk through an office building, and quickly glance at what people are running on their computers.
i had a screen capable of 1600x1200.
but i really can't be bothered to invest a portion of my life understanding the inner working of an os just to do basic things, like adjust screen resolution, alter settings, print something, etc...
its great for the desktop if your a programmer or geek, but for the general users, or power users.
but it will not reach the mainstream until it gets a lot more windows-like.
don't bother saying "but linux comes with $1000s of dollars worth of free (as in beer) software."
still, there is much more freedom in how you set up your linux box, compared to windows.
december 31, 2006 10:15 am quote:: linux is ready for the desktop, as long as you have 10 years experience in linux.
although it got many bugs and many security hole but if you come to the games (as you know that they use directx ) for the games and also use opengl (limitied) and most of the gmaes run on the direct x.
recent additions to linux desktop includes nice visual effects, similar to those in latest mac os x and windows vista.
but all the programs were very similar that she used.
openoffice, gimp, etc. work on windows too.
off course it will be the windows.
for them, it would take a long time to learn to become productive with linux.
the professional grade stuff for linux is still quite expensive.
for me personally, linux on the desktop was ready a long time ago, and windows on a desktop was never ready for me.
since i knew some basic cli i reverted to a back-up, but it did not solve my display woes.
i don't even have to google to install a program, i just type one line and ten seconds later the program is open.
linux is fine for the desktop if your requirements are not too great.
oh and what it doesn't have, and probably never will have, is security, stability and a clear conciounse.
windows come pre-installed on almost every desktop / laptop sold, most people do not install from scratch, they get a new computer via fedex, sign for it, plug it in and everything works.
as the russian proverb says, "what is good for russian is death for german"--a colorful equivalent of "tastes differ."
it is not surprising that "the masses" are uninterested in linux, when linux advocates are full of contempt for anyone with less than a phd or msee.october 29, 2006 3:54 pm
lets face it, if you want to do anything serious or commercial with your computer you need to use an operating system that is commercially compatable.
most non-it professionals will go for windows or mac, because there are all the needed apps for them, while linux is only good for running services/servers.
october 29, 2006 4:56 pm i have been running multiple desktops and laptops on linux for years.
i challenge every linux expert out there to reliably run run their system for an extended period of time after it has been configured for professional use (video editing, photo processing, sound editing, or even games).
with linux, i type less than one line to install my favourite program.
for me personally, linux on the desktop was ready a long time ago, and windows on a desktop was never ready for me.
ease of use and usefulness is objective.
i do all my photo editing w/ gimp with the photogimp makeover.
drivers problem: although in the recent years many companies made nice collection of drivers but still there are some companies still dont have drivers on the linux and therefore if you got a hardware that has no driver on linux then you will enjoy it alot.

windows is a standard mass-production house where you can change the color of walls or perhaps a floor coating.
of course linux works well as a desktop for the people who like to learn about computers and those who have invested many hours to learn its ins and outs.
still, there is much more freedom in how you set up your linux box, compared to windows.
guess what, i have work, and my coffee is going cold, then later on i have a social life, i don't want to find out nor do i gain any kind of happiness by learning about cli.
i would like to see windows die, and in fact i already work with os x to avoid using windows.
i organize all my photos with fspot and music is handled easily by amarok as is my ipod.
his entire point was that there is no point at which any technology becomes suitable for everybody.
because it sure doesn't supply the simplicity and ease of use our friendly penguin does.
in terms of my specific problem, well luckily i do know some basic cli so was able to overwrite the file with a back-up and reinstate the previous working x, but this means i have to have a low resolution to work with.
windows doesn't configure my graphics card, so most games complain of no 3d acceleration, and those that run don't run very well at all.
i`m a graduated student of electronic engineering and i use a list of softwares (matlab, multisim, opnet, protel, orcad, superpcb, labview, proteus.
but if you be a little more specific, you can ask is a 1960's hillman hunter beter than a 2007 lexus.
i just happened to discover linux when i had time and desire to explore.
you cant be leading edge by copying what everyone else does, you'll always be behind.
" someone who is new to computers will find linux is just as easy to use.
windows is a standard mass-production house where you can change the color of walls or perhaps a floor coating.

of course under the surface it is ridden with bugs, and problems are always there to thwart you.
a "we-tuned-it-for-you" software, with (mostly) good defaults and an easy learning curve, but with a severily limited capability to change anything or to see how things are working behind the curtain (like a black box).
its ok, i ve everything working but when it comes to use a specific application there is no way we can say it is ready.
software is getting better every day, the alternatives to windows are numerous, but come on, get real linux is still a geek os.october 30, 2006 7:53
for me i think that the mac os is better to be used than both the linux and the windows....october 29, 2006 3:53 pm shorter timothy: most people are too stupid to use linux.
it's the majority of users that aren't "ready" for desktop use.
when the hassle of switching is less than the cost they save by not buying windows when they get their computer (well under $100 for xp home oem).
sometimes it's a pain in the butt with hardware, but it has a lot to offer.
dimaoctober 29, 2006 3:11 pm shorter kir kolyshkin: linux is ready for the desktop, as long as you have 10 years experience in linux.
change it in any place from the top to the bottom, and see how it works on any level.
clearly both are ready for the desktop (road), and if you dont mind not having cruse control, air bags, much performance or relaibility then your 1960's gelipie will be fine.
- many millions of students worldwide will be using linux on their school-issued $100 olpc portable computers.
i like linux, i think it has some great distributions, but it still requires, even in ubuntu (the currnet 'flavour of the month' distribution), a knowledge of cli.
the only time users will use linux is when manufacturers say up yours to the extra cost of pre installed windows on all machines.
linux is unsuitable for many windows users due to being too confusing or just plain different.
well, just maybe, and i really hope it happens, a distribution will revolutionize linux enough to make it distinct, user friendly, free, and powerful enough to compete against the monolith that is windows, but right now it doesn't exist.
btw games and photoshop are not the problem.
what this demonstrates to me is that problems still crop up which require a visit to the terminal, which is not my idea of fun.
windows/intel started out being the leader for low-end functionality and price (compared to alternatives apple's mac, sun/hp/ibm/
having used unix when there was windows 3.0, before there was linux for electronics design, i can say that one can do some truly impressive ee work in a non-windows os.
october 29, 2006 3:04 pm joel, what you said is not response for "is linux ready for desktop" but "is people ready for linux", because linux as os is ready for desktop for many years but when people dont use it, programmers don't build programs for it.
and if driving a 1960's car is all you require then yes, linux is ready for you.
october 30, 2006 9:08 pm linux, particularly distros like ubuntu, are definitely "ready" for desktop use.
in short--the situation is always improving, and currently pretty much every app i need is available for my platform of choice.
october 30, 2006 7:06 am linux will be ready when you don't have to use the command line, manually edit config text files, and you can explain to your mom over the phone how to do pretty much anything...(the real sign of ease of use)october 30, 2006 9:22 am i was able to resize the screen size in ubuntu.
there is free software to do virtually everything in windows too.
windows has more options and tunables, linux comes preconfigured with a lot of "default" settings.
os x is the fastest of the bunch overall though.
while i do agree with most of what the writer says, i definitely would like people to stop beating the dead horse.
i'm an economist and linux offers all of the software tools i need.
ok, they could then go ahead and use it (on a reboot of course!).
i just do not agree that linux is ready for mainstream yet, it needs to have an amazing desktop, a simple (hidden a la os x) filesystem and rock solid package installation.
its just not possible, to get the applications required with linux to do your work.
my biggest problem was inability to use the ide cd-rom drive, because that kernel didn't support it.
linux is the house which you have to build yourself, but make it roofless or perhaps underwater if you like to.
then this will open a new market that will see linux apps developed at a improved rateoctober 29, 2006 6:36 pm
install programs easily.
catering to people who don't want to know how anything works, just want to click a button and it happens "automagically" means trading off the options, freedom of choice, and in general dumbing down everything til all it can do is what the developer decided it "should" do, not necessarily what the user "needs" it to do.
windows doesn't install sound drivers.
october 29, 2006 6:23 pm three months ago i had to rescue a windows installation that my grandma has trashed again (4th time in four months).
i have all the support i need in open office 2.0.x and firefox / thunderbird.
the important question is users are ready just not well informed.
ready for linux gurus more like.
windows looks like a ferrari compared to linux when it boots up.
linux was more of a diy, a lego style--stick the pieces together and you get what you want if you have enough construction skills.
i also find the boot and shutdown times on linux, in general, to be painfully slow compared to windows.
for instance: - tivo users, numbering in the millions, are all gnu/linux users.
thats why, tomorrow, i ll have to reformat my harddrive and reinstall windows, not becose the operating system, but because of the dependecies and software that linux, cant, yet, port to.
the mainstream is users who are not too smart and have painfully and slowly become used to windows over the course of years.
when i boot windows for the first time, i can not do the following as i can in linux: 1.
you'll not even consider linux for your desktop for a second.
as you know there are many linux versions and not a single united version of linus and every company claims that its linux os is the best among the other.
with windows, you need a second pc to install.
shorter barius: linux is ready for the desktop, if you're too stupid to know the difference between linux and windows.
not the desktop, sure its there, but they will have wordprocessors, speadsheets, email clients and so on, you dont see the desktop.
i could rezise my screen as well, but no more than 1024.
but if you want performance, relaibility, support and so on, including greatly reduced legal issues.
