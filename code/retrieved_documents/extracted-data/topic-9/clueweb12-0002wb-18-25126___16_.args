newer linux software shows respect for older software standards for fast usage, and combines those tools with modern styles to make software easy to learn.sometimes, if you have defective hardware that other operating systems don't take advantage of, linux will crash.changing, recompiling, and other modifications that can only be done under unix systems and not under windows makes linux an operating system that can be configured to do and be just about anything.linux distributions comes with all the development software, internet software (besides netscape), and system-related software you'll need.linux doesn't support java just like any other modern unix, linux supports java applications with kernel integration to the interpreter, compiles java applications and applets, and has java-enabled web browsers (such as netscape).programs can never crash the system under linux, because of the way it's built with things like memory protection, instruction monitoring, and other devices built into any true kernel.a properly set up linux system that is running on good hardware will nearly never crash.linux doesn't support javajust like any other modern unix, linux supports java applications with kernel integration to the interpreter, compiles java applications and applets, and has java-enabled web browsers (such as netscape).the operating system also provides libraries that you must normally program yourself (including sound, graphics, and more).the simple truth is, linux has better threading than windows 95 or nt's threads, and mac system and windows don't have threads if they aren't managed by the program or a third-party library.because for many users, non-"copylefted" software is offensive, linux also has a vast collection of freeware programs.however, when its code is readily obtainable, more experts are likely to download it and report its bugs.for example, in linux, the "general protection fault" error can be triggered only if your computer's memory is simply not keeping its information (in which case, you should return it to the factory).a cooperative multitasker (such as mac system or windows) will give a program control of the system until the program chooses to give it back.the compatibility myths are fueled by those who believe windows is the only operating system that is compatible, and therefore by default linux must not be compatible with other standards.
