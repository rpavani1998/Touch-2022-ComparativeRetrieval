tcl/tk: open-source, mature language for creating gui applications that will run on a variety of platforms.
wine provides a windows compatability layer than windows applications run against.
developers have no reason to learn how to program for linux.
i consider it verging on treason for linux users to be running wine.
and if there's little to no development going on for linux, then eventually people will realize that they might as well be running windows for all their windows software.
then, without warning, introduce a new layer of apis that can't so easily be replicated.
now with all due respect to the wine team-- i hold those guys in the highest regard.
sounds a lot like what ms is in the process of doing with .net.
if i were heading up the windows division of microsoft, this would be my game plan: allow the api to stablize long enough for projects like wine to support it.
developers need to get the opportunity to chose from a wide variety of cross-platform languages and tools, for them ever to produce cross-platform software.
for windows users-- wine's helpful effects: with wine in place, fewer companies will be wasting their time and dollars with distracting linux development, which means more r&d and polish goes into windows products.
personally, i think if microsoft wants their applications to run on linux, they should port them.
developers should stake a claim and make the best desktop linux software they can.
windows95 and windows nt 4.0 were soon released-- '95 was a dream for the consumer and naturally you couldn't run '95 applications on os/2, so many of the new converts switched back.
you'd almost think it was the ultimate goal of linux-- to be able to run elf and windows binaries on the same o/s."lindows" does it.
i consider it verging on treason for linux users to be running wine.
hoards of people will run their windows software on linux, to the detriment of native linux projects.
for linux users-- wine's harmful effects: instead of companies writing linux versions of their software, they expect linux users to run their windows applications on wine.
i don't think you can compare wine to virtual pc that easily.
commercial linux companies now have to deal with competing with windows products even though they weren't trying to in the first place.
new applications would require this new layer to function and thus be incompatible outside of windows.
openoffice and other open-source linix software will be free.
new applications would require this new layer to function and thus be incompatible outside of windows.
and mac users don't need to buy ms office for windows and run it on virtual pc, they would buy the macos-native version of ms office.
i totally agree with you brad, i have deep reservations about wine myself even though i can understand why they're doing it.
many of them have to resort to a dual-boot situation, or they do like myself, and give up on linux.
now with all due respect to the wine team-- i hold those guys in the highest regard.
linux desperately needs native applications if it is going to survive.
that would translate into a very negative user experience for end-users and would give linux a big black eye in the process.
theirkung foo is certainly better than mine.
we've learned this lesson already-- even if wine were to be 100% compatible with windows today, tomorrow it would not be.
wine is more seamless than virtual pc.
not to mention that these new versions of windows ran windows apps better than ever!

and if there's little to no development going on for linux, then eventually people will realize that they might as well be running windows for all their windows software.
i think the reason behind that issue is a result of the lack of (goood) cross-platform support in development suits.
but-- in the end, os/2 was not served very well by it's windows support.
for running windows applications, there is a perfectly good o/s for doing that: windows.
we only get about 20% of our downloads for linux, well over 70% of our users are on windows.
wine could allow these people to use linux as their primary os.
it was a bold, new os/2 with the best windows compatibility yet.
darkness at the end of the tunnel let's imagine for a moment that the wine project is complete and that linux can natively run all manner of windows applications.
for windows software developers-- wine's helpful effects: without the need to target linux specifically, the windows developer can concentrate on windows and let the linux 'fringe' run his windows apps if they want to.
wine: second glass from jean-philippe leboeuf notebook an interesting point of view from brad choate about wine, comparing one possible future of linux + wine to the misfortune of ibm os/2 warp +  microsoft windows compatibility....
you don't hear about mac users going out in droves and buying office for windows or much else to run under windows.
developers should stake a claim and make the best desktop linux software they can.
os/2 developers heard that loud and clear and packed their bags for the windows camp.
many windows users tried os/2 for the first time (ironically enough, i was one of them, but mainly used it for running dos and windows applications, which it did with style).
they don't deserve a free ride.
they even went a step further and released a version of os/2 called "os/2 for windows" just to further confuse everyone.
it adds capability to linux, but to the detriment of linux itself.
wine and co. will continue, regardless of what i have to say.
personally, i think if microsoft wants their applications to run on linux, they should port them.

it runs ok, but doesn't take full advantage of the linux platform.
in this light, this discussion boils down to the fact that the free os suffers from heavy competition of the commercial os - all because most of the so-called 'popular applications' just don't run (well enough) on the free os.

for windows as a platform-- wine's helpful effects: wine supports the windows platform by allowing windows applications to run on linux.
for linux as a platform-- wine's harmful effects: wine hurts the linux platform by allowing windows applications to run on linux.
wine doesn't cost anything (virtual pc retails today for $219 - $249 us).
because if linux can run windows apps, they might as well make windows apps, since windows certainly can't run linux software.
worst case, the linux application development community shrugs and starts learning visual studio and mfc.
it supported 16-bit and "win32s" windows applications by running them in a separate virtual machine, but the process was transparent enough to make it look seamless.
not to mention that these new versions of windows ran windows apps better than ever!
you'd almost think it was the ultimate goal of linux-- to be able to run elf and windows binaries on the same o/s."lindows" does it.
no-- linux loses becausethere will be less incentive to develop native linux software.

ms office will still cost money.
it's how mozilla is built, so that's good enough for me.
wine and co. will continue, regardless of what i have to say.

that would translate into a very negative user experience for end-users and would give linux a big black eye in the process.
companies may look to try out linux with this support for windows, but they find that their commercial software isn't supported by the manufacturer if it's running under linux (and in some cases, doing so is in violation of the eula).
and now, without even trying, they're making money from linux users too.
it may be somewhat slower, but not as slow as an emulator.
pm i'm sure you know it already but openoffice.org already runs perfectly fine on windows, solaris, linux (x86, ppc and even s/390).
consider: for linux software developers-- wine's harmful effects: linux users can run windows applications on wine, which means there isn't much frontier left on the linux landscape.
you could start up windows apps right on the os/2 desktop.
no-- linux loses becausethere will be less incentive to develop native linux software.
they even went a step further and released a version of os/2 called "os/2 for windows" just to further confuse everyone.
you can write cross platform solution based on the newly released ooo sdk as well.
sounds a lot like what ms is in the process of doing with .net.
now, as a software developer, i'm all about solving problems.
linux developers have even fewer employment opportunities for linux software development.
we've learned this lesson already-- even if wine were to be 100% compatible with windows today, tomorrow it would not be.
but-- in the end, os/2 was not served very well by it's windows support.
if this goal every gets reached, free software can finally start competing with commercial software on equal terms.
i realize that there are windows apps out there that don't really have a decent equivalent for linux.
windows95 and windows nt 4.0 were soon released-- '95 was a dream for the consumer and naturally you couldn't run '95 applications on os/2, so many of the new converts switched back.
for the most part it delivered pretty well.

i realize that there are windows apps out there that don't really have a decent equivalent for linux.
it was a bold, new os/2 with the best windows compatibility yet.
and naturally, you couldn't run windows nt 4 applications on os/2 either.
mac users are not using virtual pc a whole lot.
because if linux can run windows apps, they might as well make windows apps, since windows certainly can't run linux software.
for the most part it delivered pretty well.
