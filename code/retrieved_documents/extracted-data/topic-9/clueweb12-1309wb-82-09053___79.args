found a menu item to create user accounts.
we are addicted to windows.
like you said linux is completly diferent from windows.
could get to work straight up in there.
rebooted, started again.
if it still doesn’t work, wait for the next upgrade.
i honestly do not ‘hate’ windows, but a windows install with all drivers, updates and apps required takes me at least some 4-5 hours.
how quaint… open office “write” initially looked like word.
back to linux, because linux configuration is so flexible, it is wise to work with some experienced people (if you will… the equivalent of a oem winxp cd that has the appropriate drivers loaded for the bizarro brand new computer) when installing linux the first time.
got to the stage where i gave up and was logging in a root to avoid this problem.
but don’t be offended when we become frustrated by little things that seem to us to block our path.
at one point, late the first day, i could see windows shares from nix, but not the other way.
the only thing you did wrong was expect linux to be like windows.
yeah, i know you shouldn’t use root accounts for general work.
puppy is easy to use and is remarkably easy to run out of the box (so to speak).
but if you venture into server-admin stuff like mysql, it’s bound to be a lot more difficult, although in my experience setting up mysql was as easy as installing it and phpmyadmin
i expected an os that was flexible, not tainted by security issues that cause widespread annoyance and “product activations”.
the folks are usually very friendly and will gladly assist in helping with your first time linux install.
as far as file sharing, and printer sharing, with ms windows.
many unix folks intall the gnu tools to have their familiar unix commands available to them under windows.
dsl looks totally different but has firefox and puppy is just small and cute.
i’m a civil engineer, i build bridge, buildings, etc, so time is of essence.
these write nothing to the hard drive yet give you a functional system to try.
suse is a complete linux os and is loaded with software.
there is a learning curve, and especially for a power user, it’s going to take time and effort to reach the same level of productivity.
i know windows is a shity piece of infested viruses, adware and malware, but if you limited yuor usage with care you could just about survive.
it’s not productive when your environments is windows.
if you ever want to try again, i think using kde would be more intuitive for a windows user.
this is a lengthy linux setup, actually longer than most, but it has just about everything one needs for a workstation, desktop or server.
fedora is good, but more of a beast to tame.
fedora is ok for someone who knows linux and has used it before.
this has a direct impact on what i should focus on for marketable skills.
this way, you wouldn’t have to spend too much time learning a completely new interface and you wouldn’t have to deal with unfamiliar territory.
that is why linux will ask for your proper identity if you want to change something that could be harmful to the system.
seriously, get a copy of mepis or pclinuxos, and try using it for the things an average desktop user would need.
firstly, i had armed myself with a couple of different books – a copy of “fedora core 4 unleashed” and a “linux pocket book”, both containing recent fedora core distributions.
the right thing to do is go to cheapbytes, or madtux, or somebody else and pay $5 or less to have them ship you a cd or dvd of the distro you desire.
loaded the dvd from the unleashed book into the drive and hit the reset button.
i have usb flash drives, i can transfer files with them instead ;o) you might have found the printer easier if you’d been using kde tho – my gf’s printer worked out-of-the-box courtesy of kde’s setup, which was a relief as i’d had nightmares about her saying “what’s this cups thing then?”
a kde-loving friend of mine wanted to see how long it would be before he was forced to use the commmand line, and he found that he was able to do so for a long time.
if you require help, there is a wiki for both mepis and pclinuxos…in fact, pclinuxos has a link to it on your desktop when you install it.
http://www.zegeniestudios.net/ldc/index.php forgot to include the last site.
that is why config files are text-based.
my advice would be not to attempt these kind of projects if you want to test something out.
i’m very comfortable on the command line now, but i believe about a year ago i still had to look things up, and way before that i was using windows more just because i knew how and had homework to do.
every item in the books say launch this or that config file… (which, when finally found and opened, all, remarkably, look like “ini” files).
just like windows, it is very easy to use once it is up and running.
this is a very wrong approach to take, and its no surprise you went running back to windows.
if i were to install something that i thought would be useful, it would be ubuntu.
interface, a text editor, when working with them.
often times, you will learn enough from just that one install to help with future installs.
you just already know windows and don’t know linux.
linux was born on the web…not surprisingly, google is one of your main weapons if you run into issues or need to look for documentation.
and now that vista is coming out, there will probably be even more.
you can even run gui stuff from it (although that’s a more advanced topic requring you to do something like right click in the menus to find out what command is run to bring up the gui.)
what frustrates us changovers is that these same problems are either easy to solve, or can not be solved in the windows environment.
i turned both pcs off and started again the next day – only to fine that, without any further setting changes, windows could now see ‘nix shared folder.
anyway created new user account, validated it on my win box, logged in to fedora with that..
two parting comments: 1) after chewing up the better part of two full days (about 1 month ago), that particular nix pc has sat idle – i’m back to my comfortable and familiar windows world.
you don’t want an administrator to change something by accident, so you have to login as such to change system settings.
linux transgaming cedega was never stable, nfsu failed me always.
the comments were written simply as a commentary on what i first experienced – and, to a degree, to refute those silly comments i sometimes hear which go along the lines “its *easy* to swap…”.
in yor case, your extended research would more than likely ended up with a “commercial linux” (support that can be purchased) such as red hat, mandriva or suse linux.
you’d better had made a workstation installation and familiarize yourself with the system before trying something like a server install.
it would be lovely to see another article from you, to see whether the differences between linux(and in this case applications like ooffice etc), make it worth the move.
however there’s not much a way you could’ve known so now you that you do try http://www.mepis.org or http://www.pclinuxonline.com/pclos/index.html or http://www.lindows.com.
so one can easily configure a web server, database server, or file server.
mandriva is much easier to set up.
it does have the advantage of being first, so can point fingers and claim changing things for no reason.
on one side of the coin: i realize that the majority of the industry (office work stations) are using windows based machines.
combinations of needing new logins created on a windows box, along with some funny settings (i’ll prolly never find again) which match windows/sambo logins with local ids… certainly it was not easy.
download a “live linux cd” and play with it.
firstly, i had armed myself with a couple of different books – a copy of “fedora core 4 unleashed” and a “linux pocket book”, both containing recent fedora core distributions.
other people don’t care one way or the other, then wonder why they can’t access their files anymore.
in general the entire open source software movement is moving faster than any software paradigm ever had prior.
otherwise, i use a web browser, an email client, a media player, and an instant messenger, and everyone knows how to use those.
the rewards of using linux (or one of the bsds) are self empowerment.
my main desktop is a debian-based system, but the only thing that really confuses people is the desktop environment i use because there is no desktop.
(2) linux is about self-reliance, being open-minded, approaching problems in a logical manner and patience/persistance.
running everything in memory … you’re safe from viruses and malware.
you have to right-click to bring up the application menu.
though i only used older pcs to play with it on.
i turned both pcs off and started again the next day – only to fine that, without any further setting changes, windows could now see ‘nix shared folder.
at the same time, if you sit down a completely new computer user in front of a computer and tell him/her “go ahead and install windows”, you will see the same frustrations.
i couldn’t find a way to get the thing to auto-log in.
we also go into the senior assisted living centers where our elders reside.
i become good at managing partition, windows system, a bit of reg editor and i’m a bit fan of backup software (because system is always corrupted) particularly acronis true image.
then i have the os installed, all apps (open office, gimp, apache, all drivers, lots of multi media stuff, browsers, plugins, mail client, editors, the whole schebang), and am ready to go….
i want to learn and fortunately am making time to learn.
well, other than going with fedora, not much.
this is the big reason i avoid the gui, i only ever have to learn the text config _once_.
to make it sure that _you_ are given the hard time you had.
regards to all dave i do understand what you are going through because as a native windows user or native microsoft product user since dos, new os scares me off.
however, i don’t use windows at home.
it used a mysql database with a secure (https) web based interface available to any machine.
(gnome desktop by default, although i believe kde was also available – i certainly didn’t know enough to feel the need to alter their default choice).
the lack of viruses and malware makes the maintenance of my home systems incredibly easy.
as far as text configuration files go, consider this: you get to leave _comments_ in them.
i never bothered to get samba working after trying it a few times.
the disgusting “windows sickness” has indeed affected you, and microsoft is counting on that.
anyway, i finally got writer (openoffice) to send a formatted line of text to my windows printer.. although i did not understand, nor bother, about the cryptic error in the dialog i received after the print had been generated.
check out this link: http://www.zegeniestudios.net/ldc/ i use mepis (www.mepis.org), a very friendly and easy to install distro.
i just happen to like mepis better, but that doesn’t mean you have to of course….
note that some of these facilities will creep into vista for the simple reason that they are more secure that your comfortable windows.
could get to work straight up in there.
and yes, as you’ve been told, there are much easier distros to use, some which would really appeal to a windows user (i won’t bore you with a recitation, though).
printer controls are a perfect example.
wireless connectivity is problematic, but ethernet largely “just works”.
i have taken many hours to figure out how to get a given site in iis working correctly when i could get the same task done in minutes using apache.
one last server in particular i built for the company was a “network server monitoring box” using the open source package “zabbix” on suse linux.
helios i’m not going to tell you what you did wrong…enough other people are going to feel like it’s their linux duty to do that.
i, like many of the responders have been working with computers since the dos days(before windows).
as a result, linux is nowhere as easy to use as windows.
i know you can use linux commands to do these simple tasks and a lot more than that.
even i who had had significant dos, unix and windows knowledge took two years to implement a full workstation with all frills attached (including windows programs and os compatibility).
the linux / unix shells are so powerful, that you, after you got used to it, will miss it a lot when you’re forced to use windows.
they are offered for general interest and likely amusement of the ‘nix aware among you.
i worked in my employer’s it department for three years and have set up both linux and windows servers and i have about 18 – 20 years of experience with computers overall.
for example, we don’t need to knew how to use the grep command to find a file anymore.
the linux installer fired up & gave text or graphical installer options.
(gnome desktop by default, although i believe kde was also available – i certainly didn’t know enough to feel the need to alter their default choice).
no i’m not surprised nix was different to windows – i would have been amazed otherwise.
if you’re not open minded, then linux or any other os will not work for you.
i feel that this evolution if it continues will bring more of us over to the linux world.
the linux experience is not as monolithic as the experience with windows xp.
answers to questions asked can be a good thing.
after that, it was easy.
i mean windows got one 300000 lines config called regedit, and thats sucks.
then install kde instead of gnome (because it is less strange for those that are accustomed to windows) and take your time playing around with it, finding the applications you want and first-and-formost look for sources of documentation (http://www.tldp.org/ for example) and connect yourself to the novell suse newsgroups and start asking questions.
changing from windows to any other os is painful for a reason.
ton’s o’ gui tools to make this (mostly) unnecessary… i could go on, but the truth is linux is not windows (in spite of some misguided efforts to make it that way).
it’s the most documented because people love red hat and fedora is their baby.
ok… you are very correct in that buying a pc with windows preinstalled is considerably different from doing a from scratch install of any version of linux/bsd/whatever.
of course, distros are a lot more friendly now (believe it or not).
i’m just saying that there is a lot of learning involved with a change as significant as a new os.
i believe that you didn’t give linux as a whole a fair shake by using the most experimental version of linux on the market.
linux assumes that if you want the cd mounted, you’ll tell it.
my point is that humans are inflexible.
its like saying the adult is better because its easier to talk to than the toddler!
a good guide can help make the time you spend much more effective.
yes, setting up networking, samba, and networked printing is difficult, and not as well documented as you might like.
they got also excelent documentation available, left and right.
for various tasks and forgetting that i’ve been audibly frustrated when learning how to do those same tasks.
we still use windows xp here at home but very cautiously.
we did our homework and the install and configuration went smoothly.
(plus they are easily manipulated by simple programs.)
you did some quite advanced things(home networking, databases, and seemed to come out a winner.
i couldn’t find a way to get the thing to auto-log in.
but don’t expect you can do anything like you did in windows.
true, network maintenance can be hard, because there are so many subsystems.
these are for newbies who want to spend minimal effort to get going.
printed publications just can’t keep up with it so intensive (on the internet) research is a must before doing any serious linux project if you are new to linux.
i am sorry to say that your blog shows nothing more than your ignorance about foss in general and linux in particular.
dir does work with most distributions i’ve used (it’s aliased to ls, which is the equivilant linux command).
i better do not start with what does not work in the windows “shell” the linux one really is superior to it!
the command line can be used just like dos for most of the basics(and you could have got a 5 line cheat sheet of equivalents) after a while you may be surprised by what you you can use the command line for.
most unix commands are aimed at a specific task, and the usage of “|” and “>” helps link the commands together to do more complex things.
at least one i know was referred to as “cups”) setup tools, i finally found i had to blindly enter the mappings to the location of the pc/printer name, ‘cos nix would not show the printer even existed until after the password access to the printer had been validated.
with all your “whatever” and “oh well” comments, and your poor use of spell checker and grammatical review, you don’t deserve an operating system that actually works.
its had over 20yrs of maturing.
i don’t think you obtained your windows knowledge overnight.
i wouldn’t want to elicit more questions from someone with a clear lack of any ability to think for themselves.
now at home my pc is dual boot, but most of the time i am using linux.
linux has the same potential for gaming as long as distro are as good and easy for windows convert (read windows converts not newbies) to try them and this will result in developers recognising potential in linux therefore break the evil monopoly of non-standard coder in microsoft products.
as the bloke who made the original post which started this (with thanks to daniel for transcribing and loading the file), i find the comments received from all to be most interesting, some expected, some not.
ubuntu would have been a better choice than fedora.
man that’s was funny reading – a shame that you didn’t read the books before you tried linux.
all of these can be installed also if one wants to and all offer good hardware support and a base selection of applications to try.
and what frustrates us newbee’s more is that we are too ignorant to know how to find out what we need to do to solve these problems.
this was to be used to test on a local controlled private network.
on all my three machines theres is linux laptop, server and desktop and neither the time or the bravery to run the crappy microsoft os.
you actually looked like you found a weekend project that didn’t fit the bill.
you seem to have be doing fine and happy with windows, may be you should stick to it.
the linux installer fired up & gave text or graphical installer options.
if config settings weren’t in text files, you wouldn’t be able to leverage the very tools that make unix what it is.
to really compare a linux distribution with ms windows, try the paid versions of mandriva or suse, which come with a full manual and much better configuration tools.
or mii-tools for networking… let me install windows, i’ll write the same report vice versa.
it is a service on its own and does its own user validation.
though installed apps put themselves in there anyway).
i s’pose you’d get use to the “mount point” system… but i like my drive letters.
finally get to the “ok, now install it all” & waited….
then, after checking minimum hardware requirements in the books, i threw together a basic “no frills” pc running what appeared to be more than adequate – p3 600, 3/4 gig ram, 40 gig hdd, basic lan card, old dvd reader, old tnt video, no floppy, no sound, no extras.
it would never see internet or unknown source disks and so would not be at risk from foreign nasties.
how quaintâ€¦ the more newbie friendly distro’s will have an automount utility running which will mount your cd’s and floppies for you.
printers magically work, browse your network neighborhood just like in windows, plug in your ipod and bewm it works!
1)root 2)ini files 3)command line microsoft is implementing real root, ini files(in the form of xml), and a whole new command line interface.
*** linux …it’s totally different, similar to unix, bsd but requires research and , depending on your skills, some time to get comfortable with it.
how to remove software if someone remove it improperly, hey clicking on add remove wouldn’t do any good so again reg editor.
most of what you wanted to do is easily done, but you do need to take the time to learn it, ‘cuz it ain’t the same… but the rewards are really great when you do.
closing comments: fedora is a constant “work in progress”in which red hat supports but it lacks the “final finish” that a true “released” linux distribution would have.
every time i tried to do anything i was prompted for the root password.
loaded the dvd from the unleashed book into the drive and hit the reset button.
i installed linux, fired up the gui for burning a cd, chose the burner and reader and copied my first disk.
i think kunbutu as its flavour of the month)/kde install not because of particular benefit, but your probably in an ideal position to compare the two.
to do so, you don’t even have to have a gui installed, much less running.
they want to be first out the door with the new major number, and so seem to me more likely than most to ship early versions.
but learning linux to me should be more or less the same as learning windows except for linux installation was way easier particularly in pclos.
you wanted this machine to run as a database server.
you known exactly what your pc is doing and can make it do what you want and make it into a tool that fits your needs.
if you’re happy in windows, by all means, stay in windows.
at one point, late the first day, i could see windows shares from nix, but not the other way.
they are offered for general interest and likely amusement of the ‘nix aware among you.
i set everything at auto, system on 24/7 backup will start on certain date.
with some study, i’m sure suse linux would have worked for you.
you can access it over the network from your microsoft machines as a client.
i personally then use the home sites of these distrubtions, their own supported forums and spin off forums to get the info i need.
i know many, if not most will want and need a *secure* pc to protect from nasties.
[ in the corporate environment i used suse linux since we needed an addtional lotus domino server.
hello just to say i saw our home network the minute i first booted in clean install.
for example, my wife tried various distributions of linux for the first time last year and she only found 2 that she could use…mepis (www.mepis.com) and pclinuxos (www.pclinuxonline.com/pclos) go get em, try again, then let us know how it worked out.
anyway, i am off windows for nearly 2 years now, and not going back.
puppy and dsl will both fir on a mini-cd (210mb) disc with room to spare.
thick skin flame retardant suit more thick skin i am not going to flame you…you reported what you found, and you hit on the answer…you simply fail to give it any credence.
it is packed full of many different applications and using the kde desktop, looks and acts kinda like windows.
yast (the graphical configuration tool) is easy to use.
since winxp can only see driver loads via floppy at install time (won’t handle drivers burnt to a cd), if your pc is a “legacy free” cd, you’re trapped!!
but because i want to make the change and i am willing to make the investment in time and effort.
it’s always good to at least be familiar with more than just a limited subset of the computing universe.
it is a client-server database.
after this little adventure, i then hear that this, that or the other flavour of nix would have been better because….
even beyond the metafore, it is good advice.
in the old days, years before linux, i knew machines that accommodated 50, 100 and more users.
and if we can be accomodated, you will find a huge surge of userbases and financing coming your way because of us.
2 last points 1) *ix is not win and you should expect things to be drastically diff.
any way, just in case you decide to come back to give linux a second try, take my advice (i have been using linux for 6 years) and try other distributions.
all by just booting from a cd, clicking ‘install me’, answering some easy questions and letting it run….
however, on the other side of the equation: we have an industry that is primarily being directed by the whims of one huge money hungry company.
they make it “expensive” in this sense, to leave microsoft solutions!
same with ubuntu…tis good for someone who knows linux.
i do appreciate, though, that you are blindly condemning linux.
i’m not trying to say that nix doesn’t have advantages or that windows is better.
pclinuxos is linux the way linux should be.
as noted, you know windows but don’t know linux.
it’s a rock-solid distro, but it’s really geared to the experienced ‘nix/linux user.
you’ve sort of shown that, but you seen not wanting to change your behaviour and expect it to “be like windows”.
anyway, i finally got writer (openoffice) to send a formatted line of text to my windows printer.. although i did not understand, nor bother, about the cryptic error in the dialog i received after the print had been generated.
every time i tried to do anything i was prompted for the root password.
but really the proprietary unix vendors killed themselves off by playing the same game.
you installed without checking for the correct linux distribution.
(you might also want to install the ssh server so you can use putty from your microsoft machines to administer the box, and perhaps phpmyadmin so the box has a web interface into the database.)
we can use a gui file manager with a search command.
no one else in the shop seemed ot be able to get anything in the way of administration done on them, even those with basic training.
well, frig me, if it didn’t take at least 4 – 5 hours arsing around before i could even get the thing to see my windows network, let along get it to be able to transfer files back & fwd.
of course there is a learning curve, because the system is different.
i’d suggest a nice forum, or chat room; people fall over themselves to help because most will have experienced similar problems.
just like windows, if you’ve never installed it before, you might get thrown off when the installation program asks for certain settings.
imagine dialogs with about 18-20 tabs each, with multiple checkbox, buttons launching additional dialogs and so on.
i also appreciate that more and more hardware is being recognized and less headaches are being found when trying to make the switch.
i mostly agree but … there are some very easy to use linuxes on live cds that could be installed locally.
still, i wanted to learn how to use gnu/linux because i didn’t want to be stuck using windows xp with its crappy activation, eula, and digital restrictions management, so i persevered.
from a shell (what, coloured background by default… ummm different) established that mysql had loaded, and from mysql docos got the server process running.
at some point, i got drafted into also supporting macs, despite having no training on them.
following the comments posted in various forums which espouse the various benefits of linux and having a need to test a setup of “mysql” database engine, i though, well, lets give this ‘nix thing a go.
the documentation is excellent either from novell in *.pdf format from their website or the printed manuals if one buys the boxed version.
i dropped down a windows version, installed it to a xp “server” box, and was up and running remotely from my windows desktop creating tables and queries *within an hour*.
if you leave a root terminal window open, then you don’t have to constantly enter a password.
i can still “mount” a local drive to save something if needed.
i s’pose you’d get use to the “mount point” system… but i like my drive letters.
no telling, but you probably compounded the problem by using something that came from the print publishing industry.
it seems offbeat to us to not cut and past a file, but simply chane the pathname of the file.
i know many, if not most will want and need a *secure* pc to protect from nasties.
linux/foss rescued them.
in my view, neither of us are wrong here.
i use them traveling exclsively to hook up to wifi hotspots.
you’re not using linux to check your email.
i also use multiple workspaces/desktops.
lots of open source software runs on windows as well….
can’t see the disk, can’t see the ethernet, can’t see the usb, can’t see the firewire, can’t see the sound….
serial terminals don’t know “autologin”: you have to identify yourself.
it will make any learning curve less painful, and maybe a little fun happy computing
one more reason why i prefer windows is because the bill gates had manage to fork out the best game developer in this planet to work for them.
i put my hands on one of these some time ago, it was supposed to be something like a control panel developed in-house, able to control some aspects, including typical system configuration, web server configuration (apache), samba configuration and some others.
it is also free and plays on your familiar turf.
hans bezemer i would never ever recommend fedora to a beginner, totally unfamiliar with linux/unix.
last year read about knoppix in pcmag online, downloaded it,tried it and since then i like linux a lot.
this was to alert us of memory problems, disk probems, bandwidth etc.
it would never see internet or unknown source disks and so would not be at risk from foreign nasties.
i dropped down a windows version, installed it to a xp “server” box, and was up and running remotely from my windows desktop creating tables and queries *within an hour*.
it was quick to configure, and having my linux experiences, i had an easier time doing what configurations i wanted.
i liked it that you’ve taken bother in reading some documentation (text in this case), you’re “one up” on most people in this sense.
ms office should be just fine for you.
i am sure you spent an awful lot of time learning windows but very un-willing to take a little of time to get familiar with linux.
got to the stage where i gave up and was logging in a root to avoid this problem.
we just want to take a specific set of goals and find a linux way of accomplishing them.
i got by for a year or so without learning how to use tar, and it wasn’t until i worked in a company that uses unix/linux-based systems that i started to learn intermediate-level bash commands.
my boss later asked me how i was able to fix macs that i knew nothing about when.
i appreciate that more linux distributions are becoming more gui in nature.
one of the biggest problems was that the prevailing temperment of the folks that i would have liked to get help from was abrasive at best.
anyway created new user account, validated it on my win box, logged in to fedora with that..
use an early version of fedora within the major numbering scheme, and well, you’ve decided to be a lab rat.
although i suggest a new hard drive and put it on your main machine so you get the full benefit.
winxp won’t even install because you have no way of getting a floppy onto the system (apart from putting a floppy into the system from somewhere) to get the driver load so the new chipset and ide and/or sata interfaces can be seen.
i did tried linux but the learning curve was to expensive particularly to get complicated things done like telling a legacy device to work.
have a pleasant tommorow, bub what a nice read .
combinations of needing new logins created on a windows box, along with some funny settings (i’ll prolly never find again) which match windows/sambo logins with local ids… certainly it was not easy.
i’m not trying to say that nix doesn’t have advantages or that windows is better.
further, installing more apps from the disk using the gui installer changed nothing in that menu.
however, for those that don’t know it…other distros work better.
the fact that every windows user is almost automatically “administrator” has caused enough trouble already, like spyware, virusses, etc.
(as usual when responding to bug reports, somebody’d know more if you gave us details.
yeah, i know you shouldn’t use root accounts for general work.
you see, it’s quite unfortunate that many people new to linux actually think linux is just like windows, only without the problems.
thanks for some insight into how the other 90% lives.
later i took two red hat classes knowing my employer could benefit from not only using linux but having somebody trained on board.
if the gui isn’t installed, those text files are the only configuration options you’re going to have.
i believe that gnome resembles mac os more, which has the apple button at the top left.
gentoo has great forums, and freenode has irc channels for debian.
not just because kde is better than gnome, but mainly because it is a lot similar to windows gui.
after this little adventure, i then hear that this, that or the other flavour of nix would have been better because….
if you wanted a mainstream distribution, you’d probably have been better off with mandriva or some such, or even better yet mepis or pclinuxos, both of which are aimed at desktop use.
as far down to as “tweaking” the kernel, making mods to source code, building your own distro, firewall, dedicated router or just installing a home system for grandma.
i’m so sorry that i have spent all these years on windows, but because i know how it work i could get my job done.
we use pclinuxos and within 3 hours (database experimentations excluded) they are up and running with little or no fuss.
if you’re not willing to accept how things are done in a certain way, then you won’t be successful in your journey.
the machine is normal again.
.. till the installer crashed prior to the disk partitioning step.
for most people, the desktop functionality is largely equivilant.
not saying that it hasn’t his share of problems/difficultied,especially the 2006 version.
but do not believe what you may have heard that “it is easy” or “you will be up and running quickly”.
oh well, your mileage may vary, and if windows makes you happy, by all means use it.
you can comment on a certain setting, you can comment out certain settings.
every item in the books say launch this or that config file… (which, when finally found and opened, all, remarkably, look like “ini” files).
ubuntu can be ordered on the internet and comes with a “live cd” to try without installing and a seperate “install” cd.
haven’t had problems with samba recently, for example.
i will agree that you probably tried a distro that may not have been the best fit for your current knowledge of linux in general.
i never used that, i preffered to stick to editing files.
all that is required is an internet connection, since we need to install mysql from the online repositories.
command line is not as required as you state, there are lots of gui’s to accomplish things but text books tend to be overly geeky and over emphasise their use.
red hat has all of it’s source code available for download but does not offer free downloads of it’s completed linux oses.
pretty soon you will be left behind and that would be a consequence of your own decision.
iam pleased that this article was not as flamewar than others are.
well, frig me, if it didn’t take at least 4 – 5 hours arsing around before i could even get the thing to see my windows network, let along get it to be able to transfer files back & fwd.
then, no need to mess with firewalls and all that.
following the comments posted in various forums which espouse the various benefits of linux and having a need to test a setup of “mysql” database engine, i though, well, lets give this ‘nix thing a go.
this time selected text mode installer.
the interface is consistent over time, unlike guis where there’s good reasons to rearrange things constantly or to have them vary from vendor to vendor.
each distro of linux provides the configuration and setup utilities and the glue to hold it all together.
if all you do is browsing, email, and office apps, then firefox, evolution or kmail, and open office are readily usable; and setting up an attached printer is fairly easy with cups.
forever after i’ll be able to use it on about any version of unix until the end of time.
a lot of us believe we’d rather have the choice than to trust that wesayso industries will always meet our needs.
bloody hell, i wanna share with my win network, but it would not let me create a login that matched what is already in use on the win network – i currently use, my logins have a space in ‘em… like “dave jenkins” nix didn’t like that.
so you are right in that there is a considerably learning curve for a windows user, but i imagine that it would be the same vice versa.
you know for sure that it will only impact on the application you’re using: not your whole system.
further, installing more apps from the disk using the gui installer changed nothing in that menu.
it’s great to hear that someone as stupid as you has problems getting linux running.
whats odd about this article is your article criticizes linux mainly for not being everything windows is bad at and indeed microsoft is spending serious money trying to correct.
the thing about out config file is dumb.
gnome desktop – i could find no way to alter what items appeared in their applications menu.
this is largely confirmed by the fact that rebooting solved the problem.
i can’t offer much help with either, as i use slackware, but i have the iso’s for both.
you remind me of the person that takes an interest in racing and buys or acquires a formula 1 racer and complains that there’s no a/c and it rides rough.
bloody hell, i wanna share with my win network, but it would not let me create a login that matched what is already in use on the win network – i currently use, my logins have a space in ‘em… like “dave jenkins” nix didn’t like that.
in 2003-2004 i took the plunge and installed linux (as the only os) on one of my “newer” home desktops, mepis linux.
another dave looking at your article in the overall sense, you’re trying to put your windows behaviour/skills onto linux.
plus, you picked a fscked up distro like fedora (can’t waith for the fedora people to flame me now, muhaha).
with suse linux, i found more information about it from ibm and researching all of the various forums.
you don’t want normal users turning off security features.
but 10.1 is rock stable and if you need help, people have a lot of experience with 10.1
we’re all just so used to it that we’ve forgotten when we deleted things without uninstalling first or when we didn’t know you were supposed to shutdown the machine before turning it off.
after all these comments, for my desktop system i use pclos and it’s a great for windows convert to feel at home right away.
well, first of all you make the basic error if considering windows normal.
next time you may want seek out some help from a local user group, help forums and bulletin boards on the net, or a local power user.
in your case fedora was not a good selection for a newcomer as i will explain.further.
in fact, you did well.
and along the way you may learn more about computer technology, feel more secure not being as concerned about viruses and malware and save on software costs, .
my point is, that for me, when i need to find a file, i normally know about how the file is named, or possibly some text or some attributes that i can look for.
at least one i know was referred to as “cups”) setup tools, i finally found i had to blindly enter the mappings to the location of the pc/printer name, ‘cos nix would not show the printer even existed until after the password access to the printer had been validated.
as a starting point, use distrowatch ( http://www.distrowatch.com ) as a starting point to gather info about the current distributions.
the troubles i have ran into in the past when trying linux has been stuff like my sound card could not be configured correctly, or my graphics card had no drivers, or my printer would only print in black and white.
this site is good for reccomending a distrobution.
i think perhaps the only thing you did wrong was venture into the world of operating systems when your only real concern was user applications of an operating system.
please continue to send your money to micro$oft and if it occurs to you, maybe you can beg them for something that works reliably, securely and trouble free.
if something crashes you can boot with minimal settings and still correct a damaged “ini” file using the cli and a very simple editor.
gnome desktop – i could find no way to alter what items appeared in their applications menu.
i like configuration files, and i can see the beauty of them (remote administration of a server through ssh).
if you have asked your admin to mount a cd for you, you don’t want someone else to eject it while you’re working on it.
they’re both bootable cd’s, so you won’t even have to install them to try them out.
my conclusion is that you thought that linux is just another windows and instead of trying the water, you dived right in.
it is familiar turf too.
but mostly we are afraid to ask questions or comment about our frustration because of the way we are received in the linux community.
- third point: research research research more….for what you need.
linux is not windows *** if one knows linux as well as one knows windows then one can expect similar results.
two parting comments: 1) after chewing up the better part of two full days (about 1 month ago), that particular nix pc has sat idle – i’m back to my comfortable and familiar windows world.
so your bound to face these problems again pretty soon.
then, after checking minimum hardware requirements in the books, i threw together a basic “no frills” pc running what appeared to be more than adequate – p3 600, 3/4 gig ram, 40 gig hdd, basic lan card, old dvd reader, old tnt video, no floppy, no sound, no extras.
they all are very easy and amazing distro for me.
get accustomed to the fact that historically speaking it is dos and windows that are ‘all different’.
finally get to the “ok, now install it all” & waited….
a last thing: as mentioned before by others: be prepared to use a root password in vista.
yeah, i’d have a similar bunch of comments if i was an old unix user trying windows for the first time.
we are ignorant of the micro-operation intricies of linux, and we probably always will be.
a long time linux user would probably think of the tools that make linux such a powerful unix like system.
however, there will be some learning curve for all users, and if you’re not willing to take the time and effort to overcome that, then “stick with what you know” is the best advice.
i think you’ll find that the learning curve is not quite as steep as you think.
but do not believe what you may have heard that “it is easy” or “you will be up and running quickly”.
when using mandriva, i’ve hardly ever had to edit a configuration file by hand.
take for example, the root password thing as well as the command “dir”.
menus in *ux need lots of work “a simple â€œdirâ€ in the shell doesnâ€™t work.
it configures all necessary parts from the gui, and gives you access to the so called debian repositories, ‘the largest collection of software created by man’….
you probably whine a lot.
i see that the original writer’s intent was to show that it is not such an easy thing to switch ones operating system.
windows assumes that it’s ok to autorun sony’s rootkit installer without even asking you, just because you put the cd in the drive.
you can run it off the cd before installing.
most of us convertees do not want to become linux guru’s and teach in a collage or something.
trouble is, *nix is so configurable that they were simply unusable.
from a shell (what, coloured background by default… ummm different) established that mysql had loaded, and from mysql docos got the server process running.
actually, everything is different from windows, but the point is that if you want to use a new system, you have to expect a learning curve.
email, browsing, wiritng a letter, printing to a locally attached printer, that kind of thing.
but what it really comes down to is, jumping onto linux is like learning a new language.
believe me, 99.9% of malaysian never heard of linux.
i think few users need to edit config files by hand on a regular basis.
i really prefer the linux environment.
yeah, i’d have a similar bunch of comments if i was an old unix user trying windows for the first time.
and never dive in before trying the water.
i’m sure you’ve read the reason behind the need for a root and normal user accounts in the books you’ve bought.
i showed her that firefox was already up and running on desktop 2.
a more newbie friendly distro would have made the experience, while still difficult, much better.
