linux has much better security and low over head.at work, it's my job to tweak things, make it work, utilize the stability of linux for uptime etc.video chat is also supported well on linux through skype and pidgin.windows runs just about every game natively without emulation and linux doesn't.windows almost always requires a codec pack, and without 3rd-party software, it's not easy to tell which codecs are installed and which are not.some of the best evangelism starts at the retail level, where employees can 'inform' the buying consumer while trying to sell a life-saving in-store warranty policy.they use all kinds of os's no ones even heard of let alone suitable for the end user.the only way they will get the support is to push for it not expect people to give a damn about them cuz they are "open source" or "better".for gaming, entertainment, day to day stuff windows is better, has more apps, more options, and usually not a big deal finding drivers or configuring some weird stuff.then there is office where microsoft office is used by 99% of the work and education world and with openoffice being free its not 100% reliable when it comes with compatibility.hardware support for windows is by far better than linux.think again, linux is not a newbie o/s and most people aren't going to put the effort in all the training involved in setting up linux.the "security" thing gave me a laugh, and they also claimed it wasn't clear whether linux updated critical vulnerabilities quickly or not, or that it was harder to install programs and updates.it's a good thing it doesn't work on linux because it's a load of crapware anyway and there are much better gpl programs.i still think windows is a better os for personal use and single user mode.
