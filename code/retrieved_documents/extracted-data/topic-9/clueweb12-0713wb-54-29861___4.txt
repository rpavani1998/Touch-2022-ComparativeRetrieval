if anyone knows what i have done wrong, or how to fix this  problem it would be greatly appreciated!!
one advantage is that if you select the linux partition at bootup then decide you want windows instead, you just choose windows when you get to the linux bootloader, thus reloading the nt bootloader again.
i don't care much for windows except for the  occassionaly must-have win32 app without *nix equiavalents(the list approaches  nil as i speak!)

this approach also allows for more  flexible partitioning strategies such as a linux swap partition mounted at  /dev/hda2 right after the "/" partition for performance reasons(i.e  read disk access times and seek latency numbers) also keeping a  common "/home" mounted partition is a good idea for organizing your  personal data with redundancy.

i am not sure if your live  cd is older, and still has the option, or if you are using a different version  of gparted.

if you don't, windows will not recognize there is any free space on the  drive and will say it's 1 large unknown partition.
...just an observation.
check it 29 february 2008, 8:39 pm (4 years ago) report abuse send to a friend reply leode1 (new user):
this approach also allows for more flexible partitioning strategies such as a linux swap partition mounted at /dev/hda2 right after the "/" partition for performance reasons(i.e read disk access times and seek latency numbers) also keeping a common "/home" mounted partition is a good idea for organizing your personal data with redundancy.
do note the post as to the correct  format for the makeactive command...
before burning the next cd use  checksum to verify that the contents are correct.
if anyone knows what i have done wrong, or how to fix this problem it would be greatly appreciated!!

why not one version  that is supported for a number of years and works out of the box, like windows.
i have a vista (installed 1st) - ubuntu (installed 2nd) - xp config now.
i got to do this as  my old hd failed and after i put a new one - neither xp or my macbook could  read the bad drive.
forgot about the "swap" partition which was recommended when i installed ubuntu... therefore it makes xp on the 3rd partition, or hd(0,2) instead of hd(0,1) hd(0,1) =
currently i have ubuntu 6.10 installed on my laptop, and i want  to dual boot windows xp for the first time.

unfortunatelly my pc didn't boot  from the cd (i did change the ''bios" to make it boot from the cd)  and nothing happens!
like several other  people, i don't seem to have the manae flags in my menu.
however this is fiddly and involves using fat32 partitions" bzzzzt!
any suggestions please post.

plus all i have to do to get access to my "/home" partition under xp is to use the fs-driver ext2 kernel filesystem extensions in xp) www.fs-driver.org anyway
the numbering scheme there starts from hd0 ; unlike /dev/hdax, where hda1 is always first.
your grub bootloader workaround is fantastic!
all was well but ubuntu boot failed run_progess `/sbin/modprobe` abnormal exit https://launchpad.net/bugs/84964 does not seem to be a fix.
