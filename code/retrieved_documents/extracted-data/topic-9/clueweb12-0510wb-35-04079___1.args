look at pictures (points to gqiew configured to start at top of picture folder, large icons, etc) in gqview, right click will edit in default picassa i drag the entire games menu to the desktop chat with people (points to pidgin, autologin) i drag kde control center to the desktop, leave it as control center
some still require ms word (dual-boot just for this) because that's what the school teaches and gives assignments on, but for most other tasks they use openoffice for presentation and spreadsheet just fine.
once i moved all my kids and their mom to linux, with auto-login and nice accessible icons and menus (some kids even found beryl-compiz cool), my support time has been drastically reduced.
she's also "lost" her kmix applet a few times and so couldn't adjust volume until that was restored.

firefox for web (with very obvious bookmarks on the bookmarks bar), thunderbird for mail, and vlc for watching web-based videos of her grandkids.
and to nicely round off the playing field, for the better part of a decade, i've been supporting a network of apple computers.
contrary to popular opinion an older user particularly with no windows experience takes to linux easier than a younger person with windows (i.e. bad) experience.
granny wants to email and surf, nothing more.
if we work together, we can dominate the elderly desktops of the world in no time.
they come pre-installed, have friendly phone support, and last a long, long time.
before, i had him on windows nt, so he already understood the drill about logging in.
picasa gives her the ability to suck the photos off her digi-cam, correct red-eye, and e-mail (appropriately auto-resized) photos to her friends and family.
a couple of years ago, i had already migrated him from ms office and outlook express over to openoffice.org and thunderbird (he *really* likes thunderbird).
hmm...openoffice.org writer handles the ms word format just fine and has for years.
the reason is that macs generally "just work", and require very little maintenance (read: very few calls to friendly grandsons).
the killer app (though not-libre) is picasa for linux, which installs (and self-updates) on debian/ubuntu the correct way (via apt).
install things like flash, java, mp3 support, dvd support, video streaming plugins, and true type fonts.
grip pre-configured to rip into the default music folder of amarok, all set up.
the easy way is with some sort of rsync, preferably done from lvm snapshots.
an external usb drive that holds an rsnapshot archive (with snapshots automatically initiated when the system has been idle for a few minutes or if more than 2-3 days have passed since the last backup) would be my choice.
i also made it possible for me to remotely access their computer.

though not quite iphoto-easy, it works well enough for a somewhat tech phobic granny.
kmymoney turns out to fill the bill pretty darned nicely.
even if you're a pro, spyware is a pain in the butt to clean up.
internet (links to ff) email (links to thunderbird) pre-configure their junk folder, show them how to mark things as junk.
1) show them where downloads from the web are defaulted, change if needed.
literally, the icons are named.
6) change kde so that unmounted cd/dvds icons remain on desktop, make sure that all removable drives/devices show up on desktop when mounted (automount).
hands down, the number one problem people come to me about is spyware.
note that to support granny remotely one of you is going to need a real internet account, one with a fixed ip.
they come pre-installed, have friendly phone support, and last a long, long time.
if, for some strange reason, you don't have the bandwidth then use an outside service like rsync.net.
4) enable mouse over previews of everything, including mp3s.
pre-configure any mp3 players in amarok before i turn them loose watch a movie (points to kaffeine, as you said, with all codecs installed) get pictures (points to digikam, preconfigured with default pictures directory)
they just do not seem to 'get' that we do not use windows here.
i don't mind at all, and i love to help people.
for some reason, even when no cd/dvd there, having the icon is re-assuring.
bibus, gimp, tellico, etc. complement their works.
i have oemed linux a lot, here are the common links i put on the desktop.
granny shouldn't be changing her machine much, except when upgrades happen, so a lot of bandwidth is not necessary.
there's rarely reason why the entire box should not be backed up, because someday you will need to restore the whole thing.
5) pre-configure any hardware they use, if required, as sane to the desktop, etc.
configure system updates to run as automatically as possible.
i completely realize i'm a geek.
everyone understands the trash can concept.
really helps when you are living on different continents.
at some point cousin eddie or one of the many other relatives who know granny has a computer are going to generously buy her some wonderful piece of software.
hands down, the number one problem people come to me about is spyware.
this has required zero trouble-shooting on my end, except for an occasional wi-fi failure (which is always related to dsl flakiness and not the wireless network itself).
now granny can have bad passwords and she won't get cracked.
kai staats, ceo of terra soft solutions (the yellow dog linux folks), has a similar story involving his father.
since linux will run on anything from a toaster oven to a space station -- unless there's actual physical damage, the upgrade to linux should cost nothing but some of your time.
rsnapshot is a great way to keep backups and include a history over time.
and to nicely round off the playing field, for the better part of a decade, i've been supporting a network of apple computers.
it's very simplified and locked down.
reason: seven years of bug fixes, and he's a few thousand miles away, so regular ubuntu-ish or fedora-ish reinstalls aren't an option.
and they're going to be very, very angry at you for 'breaking' her perfectly good windows and replacing it with 'some crap that can't even run common programs like microsoft office and photoshop'.
it's for moms and kids too.
make sure granny calls you with questions, not cousin eddie.
chances are, granny's computer hardware is fine.
some distros, like linux mint i believe, come with a lot of these things available out of the box as it were.
if you're the one with a fixed ip configure granny's box so that when the interface comes up it brings up an openvpn connection into your network.
this does mean that granny needs to leave the machine on, at least sometimes.
put bookmarks on the browser's toolbar.
disable password ssh logins and use public/private keys to get in with your account.
either that or you need some easy button she can press so she can read you her ip number off the screen.
had to install all the multimedia codecs, *adobe* flash (sorry, gnash just ain't ready yet--i wish!), and the kernel video driver to get acceleration and resizing.
don't forget the accessibility feature.
on the lilo screen i created an obviously named entry that boots to runlevel 2 where sshd is loaded.
even if you're a pro, spyware is a pain in the butt to clean up.
remind granny not to try buying software from walmart, or online.
therefore, the only app i had to worry about was a quicken 2003 replacement.
other than those minor blips, it's been really painless and quite a testament to the user-friendliness of the modern linux desktop.
label them so granny will understand.
i had them hooked to firefox, thunderbird, and openoffice in windows before moving them to linux.
after the above, 10-20 minutes watching and helping them, they are on their way, very litle support needed.
if they have questions, fire up krfb and share their desktop to see what's up.
my in-laws still buy our kids windows games every birthday and christmas.
make the taskbar/panel large install skype and/or instant messaging software, and preconfigure them so
i choose to use linux but i don't force my family to stop being able to use windows software, and theinfinitely better selection of games.
turned out mr. staats needed exceedingly little hand-holding.
3) i demonstrate how to find and install software (if savvy, otherwise, i tell them to call me).
if we work together, we can dominate the elderly desktops of the world in no time.
it doesn't work well enough, or at all, with a hell of a lot of the software out there.
since linux will run on anything from a toaster oven to a space station -- unless there's actual physical damage, the upgrade to linux should cost nothing but some of your time.
the reason is that macs generally "just work", and require very little maintenance (read: very few calls to friendly grandsons).
granny can chat with you.
apr 17, 2008  by  shawn powers in desktop i completely realize i'm a geek.
then you'll aways be able to get to granny.
disable root ssh logins.
hi i would like to recommend you very usefu ltorrent search engine - http://torrenttella.com/ you can find a lot of new movies, games and music there.
also had to do a bunch of tweaks to get past the gnome-isms of red hat distros (he runs kde--it looks more "windows-like").
one other thing helped out a lot.
