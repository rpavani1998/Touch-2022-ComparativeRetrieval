this sme area is price-sensitive, hasn't upgraded for years, has no it management: it's where linux can make a difference, and it's where i reckon it's hardest for linux to enter - for reasons that i will describe later.
meanwhile, novell had changed their os completely to version 4, which no one i knew found easy to use.
pretty soon we were selling networks made up of windows for workgroups workstations with a windows nt 3.51 server, for a much lower overall cost than the previous novell-plus-diskless workstations solution, and with pretty reasonable reliability and performance.
we could put a network of twenty-five peer-to-peer workstations into a site for much less than we could do a novell installation.
it still crashed unpredictably, and took even longer to fault-find or reinstall.
people who still like windows, use windows grudgingly, or deal with linux-windows integration in lans will also find the information useful.
they had introduced large-scale management tools, which merely muddied the waters for our typical installs of 5 to 10 clients, and it cost more than version 3.x.
meanwhile the workers and researchers, who just wanted to get things done, were bringing in their own windows machines and running spss or mathcad or some custom sample analysis software on them just to get the work done, and meanwhile the new spectrometers in the lab came with windows-based software that had to be copied by hand to the unix system!

also the clients could install their own extra software packages without invoking our aid (and paying for it).
i adopted nt4 workstation as my personal desktop as soon as it was released, but i had to dual-boot with 98 because nt4 did not run games well - and i like games.
we don't like the licence (it's a potential problem for most solicitors/lawyers and anyone else with a duty of confidentiality), we don't like the desktop (it's an insult), we don't like the vulnerabilities, or the slow performance, or the sheer undocumented mass of it all.
windows 2000 server, 2000 as or especially windows server 2003 are a ridiculous overkill for an office with six client machines, as well as being much more expensive and needing huge hardware resources to run.
windows 95 was effective - it's a masterpiece of forward and backward compatibility in my view - but it was not stable.
i could source the same lead (apart from the blanked hole) for $7.
it was also abstruse, non-intuitive (indeed, counter-intuitive at times) and completely non-user-friendly.
i've had win nt 4 boxes stay up for years.
it's a long and somewhat sad story, but in the end, you'll maybe see why, once, windows nt was better for our clients than xenix/sun, and why now linux may be better than nt.
also the clients could install their own extra software packages without invoking our aid (and paying for it).
the psu failed one day, and i managed to migrate the system to a different box and a bigger hard drive and get it all working again (i never was sure how).
but it is the sme area that has in the current, somewhat-recessive economic circumstances, consistently been identified by the it industry as the last largely untapped potential growth area.
in spite of the series title, it's not just for those who have stopped using windows completely.
the plague years then the viruses started to really hit.
in fact, for both these extremes the issues are arguably simpler: at one end it's just personal choice of platform, at the other the resources are available to implement customised solutions as needed.
it was pretty solid, pretty easy to use, fast, adequately tuned, and a good desktop system.
but that gnu/linux could so easily match or exceed this performance impressed me.
i installed it and played with it, but it didn't do anything i needed.

we don't sell xp, if we can help it.

moreover, with the windows system, the clients had the illusion of a familiar system - most of the decision-makers who wanted to introduce networked systems already had windows boxes at home.
and for the client, again it gave the illusion of familiarity - it looked like windows.
we got used to reformatting and reinstalling.
not only are there lots of interestingly geeky x-desktops available, but two mainstream competitors for windows 2k/xp, with generally enhanced capabilities.
workstation would only handle ten clients; this was reminiscent of the intel tricks with the 486 series.
we could put a network of twenty-five peer-to-peer workstations into a site for much less than we could do a novell installation.
pretty soon we were installing a lot more windows for workgroups than novell.
it still crashed unpredictably, and took even longer to fault-find or reinstall.
any minor configuration error was often fatal.
if the problems can be solved here, then linux will become 'sticky' at this level of the 'ordinary' user.
then we put some test boxes into clients, mostly as mail servers/file servers with av integrated, and they have on the whole been working flawlessly ever since.
within about ten days of starting i'd been bumped up into a systems and end-user support role as well.

well, yes, given the age of the systems being replaced, it was in fact more reliable.
overall the server/diskless workstation was a very good fit for the clients' needs; it was reliable, fast (the 10 mbps network was faster than contemporary ide drives) and easy to maintain (all the configuration files were in one place).
nonetheless, i kept an eye on gnu/linux and installed most builds of slack, then red hat.
the target business that i'd like us to keep in mind is a small office - say eight or ten users altogether - and if this small office has a history in computing, it will generally have been in dos and windows.
many of our clients are running windows nt 4 server.
however, nt workstation was too expensive to sell into our clients in general, so our standard install was windows 98 on the desktop and windows nt 4 server on the back end, and this worked pretty well.
not only are there lots of interestingly geeky x-desktops available, but two mainstream competitors for windows 2k/xp, with generally enhanced capabilities.
i installed every mainstream distro i could get, on every box i could test it on.
at the particular sites in question, 'the sun' was under the exclusive control of 'the system administrator' - who would install only what they wanted to install, after triplicate written requests, passed back up to company hq and triple signed off by company it.

the psu failed one day, and i managed to migrate the system to a different box and a bigger hard drive and get it all working again (i never was sure how).
of course, it didn't take long for the downside to be apparent - no central installation of applications, no central control of rights, no user controls whatsoever, big problems with workstation backup, insecure peer-to-peer networking.
i've noticed that people with a unix background often have had little contact with those who have been weaned on dos - and vice versa.
any company that exploits a monopoly in this way develops users who detest it.
of course, building all the workstations took time, so i developed a custom cloning system that could build ten identical workstations in about fifteen minutes each.
windows nt server was pretty darn stable (after a few service packs), and so we all looked forward to windows nt 4 coming in 1996, with the back-end stability of nt and the new interface of 98.
they'd done a good job for their owners, but the replacement - with windows 95 on the desktop and windows nt 3.51 on the server - was like jumping forward a whole epoch, compared with the 9600 baud green-screen serial terminals in previous use.
but windows 2000 pro had a deliberately broken networking model, presumably to force a contrast with windows 2000 server.
add third-party software (and a different mix of such software on every box) and problems would arise that no-one reliably could solve.
it was big, and the interactions within the systems were unpredictable.

overall the server/diskless workstation was a very good fit for the clients' needs; it was reliable, fast (the 10 mbps network was faster than contemporary ide drives) and easy to maintain (all the configuration files were in one place).
and for me, it came from the architect of digital vms - it was written by someone who did know what they were doing.
by then (and we are getting to 1995 or so), we had become pretty well-known and had a good reputation for looking after clients, so more than one solicitor came to us to replace their 286/386 xenix-based system, which was by then getting pretty long in the tooth (like me now!).
the outlook mail/groupware client was also broken, in that core functionality had been moved to exchange server, and as far as i could see for one reason only: to make clients buy exchange server.
enter the band-wagon then windows for workgroups came along.
but windows 2k was still a good bet for our clients, although it was getting really overblown in size and slower and slower every issue.
the video lead - which if i remember correctly was standard apart from the blanking off of one pin - was $150, about, from sun.
i'm referring here to small installations of between two and a hundred desktops and servers.
they had introduced large-scale management tools, which merely muddied the waters for our typical installs of 5 to 10 clients, and it cost more than version 3.x.
i never installed any rs232 terminals, but i removed a lot.

moreover, gnu/linux has over the last few years transformed its graphical desktop capacity.

at that time most of the clients were solicitors (lawyers), and their systems typically were running a novell server on a i386 or i486 with scsi drives, with up to twenty-five diskless net-booted i386 workstations, running wordperfect.

yes, windows and windows networking at that time actually represented more 'freedom' for these people, and eventually the lab sun systems were retired and sold off.
