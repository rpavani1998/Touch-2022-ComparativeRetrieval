this knowledge typically presents a steep learning curve and for those who don't care to learn what it takes, it is an insurmountable obstacle.i think it already has a robust and sustainable user base and that people will continue to be attracted to it in the future just like they were in the past.and i would love to see linux get in the game and take up a good portion of the market and have the right resources easily at my disposal.part of the purpose of distro package management is to correct such errors by individual developers.as an analogy, think what would happen if musicians had to actually perform instead of just collecting royalties, because all their recorded material was freely reproducible under law.windows comes pre-installed on most pcs, is geared towards the masses, and is available.so often people are encouraged to switch to linux (when windows worked fine for them) - they try it and, after a bad experience, they not only turn away, but have scorn for it too.the distro's also keep track of security risks and other problems -- they are contributing a very significant oversight layer.i figure if someone wants to learn all the little things it takes to get a linux system up an running, they will, they will stick with it, and they will get there under their own steam.it would be cheaper to just get a computer which is 25% faster.i have friends who have windows computers at home and the whole family uses them and such and i'd be nuts to think i'd be doing them a favor by recommending they switch to linux.redhat is still (by necessity) all gpl licensed software, so there is nothing illegal about "pirating" it.there's so much more to tweak and so much more time and effort required with a fresh install of windows.linux is not fast food, and it is not a commercial product.like i said, there are no shareholders who will benefit, it's not a stock you can purchase, so achieving a greater market share is just a macho goal.
