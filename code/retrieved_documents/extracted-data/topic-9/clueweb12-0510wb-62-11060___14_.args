free software has nothing to fear from a heterogeneous environment – indeed, mixing technologies almost forces open standards upon manufacturers if they want to provide full interoperability.if gnu/linux became as dominant on the desktop as windows, there would be a greater incentive to break that security – and a bigger knock-on effect when it was broken.the traditional desktop experience is being further redefined through the move to cloud computing solutions, which are frequently browser-based, and the appearance of gnu/linux-based ultraportables, which also draw on net-based solutions for much of their convenience.thesplashtop technology uses gnu/linux as a kind of pre-operating system that lets users boot up very quickly to gain internet access and perform key tasks such as checking email or moving around the web.once people realise they have a choice, then windows' stranglehold on the desktop market will be fatally loosened.far better to promote heterogeneity, which is good for the software ecosystem, and thus good for *all* users.what this means is that users of these systems, even when rigorously windows-based, will be experiencing the power and speed of gnu/linux, albeit unwittingly, when they use this mode.this is manifest most clearly in schools, where teaching computing really means teaching children how to use windows and office.one of the best proofs that free software is superior in all senses to proprietary software is having the maturity to recognise that the world of personal computing today is far more complicated, and far richer, than bill gates's original, monopolistic vision of “a (microsoft-based) computer on every desktop”.surf the web safely, immune from the malware that targets windows.it’s a fully integrated technology that will appear later this year on the dell 4200 and 4300 latitude series notebooks, and is powered by a linux os, sort of as a secondary operating system.moreover, as many have pointed out, the low number of gnu/linux viruses is only in part down to the latter's superior design.some things work well in windows, and others are a nightmare, hence it's more pragmatic to be open to alternatives.they're intimidated by technology in general, and they believe windows makes things easy enough for them to cope.moreover, if the idea proves popular, it's not hard to imagine most pc manufacturers following suit in order to match dell's move, ensuring that many more people experience the fact that it is possible to use a pc without using windows.
