no pax without hardware nx is emulated nx and you incur some performance hit.
first of all, you would have a much better support team as they would really know the product, being the linux powered operating system of choice, and secondly if you doled out the support costs of one of these enterprise class operating systems to your staff who are to support the os, you would have much more longevity out of your employees, and there would be much less turnover.
a lot of routers, and cable/dsl modems have it.
" the number of vulnerabilities directly relates to the security of the software out of the users control.
regardless software dep is present on windows xp sp2 and vista adds aslr.
stop listing the secunia "advisory" totals which is not an accurate listing of the vulnerabilties.
and while i would love to see the day when more people buy linux on a pc than windows, it does not seem doable as the games and everything are not written for linux, windows and mac...
"i do think microsoft owes its customers using xp the ability to fix some of the problems with hardware dep.
a firewall's main purpose is to provide security from attacks and the windows xp sp2 firewall is an excellent solution that does just that.
microsoft since windows xp was released provided documentation for game developers to program their games correctly.
" dep (or pax) only shine when you are running a server or a multiuser machine.
"impartial analysis of popular trends and technology" copyright Â© 2004-2011 popular technology sunday, january 14, 2007 windows xp more secure than linux anyone who tracks security vulnerability reports knows of the ridiculous amount that reference holes in linux.
to simplify things i took the latestlinux kernel v2.6.x and compared it to windows xp.
blocking the wrong service can lead to the internet appearing as if it's unreachable.
while it can run, this is irrelevant since the average user runs windows as full admin.
until then, i will be using both, using windows for complete compatability, while linux will be my play system.
on a limited user account windows xp does not let "anything" change the registry.
in my case, i changed to linux (from windows) many years ago, because linux (and its associated applications software) was far more stable and reliable.
you don't dep is provided through software in windows too.
and since i strongly suspect i started doing it stuff before you were born (the age you exhibit in your post suggests early to mid teens), i suspect i know an awful lot more about what i'm talking about than you do.
second i have no credentials in security so this is coming from a security novice.
i stand by my original opinion that home users could benefit from outbound filtering.
those that do already use a third party firewall.
though nx support makes it even more secure.
nothing has gotten more press to fail so badly.
the article i linked to proves conclusively why it is impossible to guarantee outboung filtering with someone running as an administrator in windows xp.
i am sure a network administrator would be more than happy to tell you about the wide difference in intended usage and sad functionality even for end users.
even with open source advocates finally admitting thatlinux is insecure they still try to claim it is more secure than windows.
and ssp and technology that works through the compiler cannot be enforced with the majority of the software for vista that comes in binary only.
using the supervisor bit is just a trick and not a substitute for real nx hardware support.
this one version of the linux kernel (v2.6.x) has more vulnerabilities than windows xp which has been out for 5 years.
and for legacy support, exes distributed without flags set for protection won't benefit from aslr by default.
so this comparison isn't really any better than the other previously listed comparisons, which is disappointing seeing as the author did attempt to discredit those additional mislabeled comparisons.
i made a very logical analysis based on the data provided.
i do think microsoft owes its customers using xp the ability to fix some of the problems with hardware dep.
talk to anyone who works at a microsoft helpdesk and they will tell you one of their #1 problems with people loosing internet access is the third party firewall blocking it.
once patches stop you cannot guarantee security.
most of the unix installations i administer have no requirement for gaming.
since the technicalities of what linux stands for can be manipulated at will by the open source zealots to try and confuse the average person.
the difference with antivirus is it is designed to catch the infection before it can do anything.
ssp, and other source fortification are the new techniques windows will never benefit from as long as the majority of software made for the platform comes from outside microsoft.
i could sit a child down and they would probably be able to bypass the weak architecture.
in addition, the aslr implementation in vista has some weaknesses.
ipsec sounds good at first, but in reality is too static for typical usage for anything other than a server.
a firewall should be able to manipulate any activity that pertains to the tcp/ip stack.
"the rating is based on the most severe vulnerability discovered.
i fully grasp that windows is more secure than linux.
it doesn't make linux any more secure.
aslr was invented by pax. i just found it ironic that microsoft accuses linux of violating its ip, makes no concrete claims, yet gives no credit to aslr's original author.
motorola's successor to the razr is supposed to use linux.
" i understand and see how it can be useful in a server environment
windows xp can run in limited user accounts just as easily.
thirdly, windows allows any program really to change the registry and has no security features to prevent that like linux does.
if linux "sucks" because you can not play your favorite games, you should change the article title.
linux is not more stable and reliable than xp.
"it is emulation in the sense that no nx bit is present.
i wouldn't tell someone that windows is more secure, or that linux is.
it still doesn't randomize the stack or heap.
i don't care for zealous os advocates of any kind, they seem to ignore the fact people can judge for themselves.
software dep provides more protection than no software dep.
like i said you will not find me using anything but windows 2000 or xp.
" windows xp came with a firewall from day 1.
"it is a widely accepted fact that the windows firewall offers no protection against outbound connections which offers no protection against phone-home attacks which means personal data could window up in the hands of those who would like to exploit it."
i haven't seen much of anything with a linux os in it.
no one who wants to get work done wants to compile something, they simply want to use it.
"even ignoring the malicious, a user might want some notification that an application is calling home.
it is of no surprise that linux users are clueless about windows security and spread lies and misinformation about the windows xp firewall.
even giving something away for free doesn't help.
sure - you point out that linux kernel 2.6.x has more vulnerabilities then winxp.
if we say install a few im clients, office, photoshop, adobe reader, flash, winamp, realplayer, and many other programs you need to actually use xp-you'll find out the windows has a huge amount of total vulnerabilities.
a user's security is never out of their control.
working in the role of an administrator tends to taint my view of what a firewall should do.
"i am quite certain that leaktest could run under a limited user account.
the windows search returned 103 million hits, the linux search returned 201 million hits.
the facts are clearly stated.
they kept it basic because doing otherwise would be considered monopolistic.
even beyond that, the many that haven't been addressed at all will pose an issue to your system's security.
sdl and opengl are wonderful replacements for directx. nvidia even provides its cg toolkit.
if someone doesn't want to cough up the cash for isa/commercial firewall/hardware firewall, pf or iptables does become useful.
the constant distro mess and lack of game and driver support.
but that is the power of windows and the great depth of software that is available for the windows platform.
working around something is standard practice but the vulnerabilities are definitely out of the users control in terms of them appearing.
the resources for game developers are there.
also note that novell suse and microsoft windows meet eal4.
it environments in the real world do not have these problems regardless of patch time.
in other words they are fewer (18 as opposed to 32) and less critical for linux as for the rest of a gnu-linux os, apart from some parts of xorg, as far as i know everything else runs in userspace, thus can't do any significant damage.
and for the record - i did not say xp was unstable - i said that linux is more stable and reliable.
winxp has to be restarted when you install the teeniest-tinyest piece of software, while linux can run for years and still have up-to-date software.
it is designed for home desktop users, which is an area linux still does not understand.
without hardware backing you at best get emulation which is never a guarantee.
to be fair, the way you would calculate your exploits would be to first identify all the exploits of the kernel, then add any additional exploit that does not include the previously listed kernel exploits to "an" operating system.
remember that), but the rest of the gnu-linux os (no matter what disttro you use), has little to offer in terms of serious vulnerabilities, since most things run in user-space.
funny you should bring up the windows "grouping" which were counted, and you show 2-3 vulnerabilities.
it isn't software though.
without complex hijacking of a process in memory malware can simply try to connect as ie.exe.
"i find it hilarious you mention both the "insane amount of games" and limited user accounts on the same page.
the time to develop, test and publish a patch is irrelevant since this data can easily be manipulated and the testing of a linux patch does not effect anywhere near the amount or scope of windows users and software.
emulation means it is running in software and thus pretending to be something aka "fooling".
the tomtom gps device uses it.
all the games i want to play are either overly complicated to setup or do not run.
the windows firewall might be good enough for you, but it certainly lacks the functionality most would expect."
the rating is based on the most severe vulnerability discovered.
"you also ignored the fact linux had this protection before windows xp even came out.
i have heard tons of hype about it in tech news though.
i spend no time searching for or updating anything.
now if you start looking into and adding up linux "distribution" vulnerabilities that can take you into thehundreds upon hundreds of security holes that are never talked about.
most users would just let it through.
that would be done from a central location and has nothing to do with the xp firewall!
i do not have any stability or reliability problems with xp.
thus including the distribution vulnerabilities would be much worse for linux.
" sorry you are not going to get away with it that easily.
red hat will compile it for their customers with this technology already implemented.
i too have seen users get nervous when popups regarding system processes that look foreign are asking permission to act as servers or clients to alien ip addresses.
"anyone can do a search to see the massive problems windows users encounter trying to run games and other applications under a limited account.
which is why outbound filtering is irrelevant on xp.
alright, i won't mention unix anymore.
linux is less secure than windows xp.
your view of which os/kernel is most secure is coming from historical advisory numbers and isn't taking account of the time it takes to develop,test and publish a patch.
all that someone can promise is to issue patches to known vulnerabilities within a reasonable period.
when you take the average user's computer skills into question, the argument for third party firewalls does need a fair amount of skepticism.
i still run into os 9 users quite frequently.
vista has put in system safe guards that make this extremely difficult to do even with full system access.
it is all automatic and i don't get infected with anything.
even as they are grouped it doesn't make it useless.
none of which changes the fact of the insane amount of games that run natively (not through emulation) in windows xp nor all the designed for windows xp compatible games that run as a limited user.
web servers mainly but the desktop share is pathetic and since windows xp is a desktop os that is where the comparison is.
"my question still stands, if you knew that someone needed windows 95, and only accessed the outside world through a web browser, what security issues would be presented by loading a recent copy of opera or firefox and putting them behind a decent firewall?" i wouldn't run it and wouldn't put my reputation behind it.
i am already employed in it and deal with security daily, i do not irrationally take online gossip as a decision to use certain software but
that is very telling of the insecure state of linux which is overly hyped as "secure".
these are the application not designed to circumvent a third party firewall.
see http://www.grc.com/lt/leaktest.htm for an example of an application that can completely bypass the windows firewall.
the average user does not care.
to andrew: the article makes use of these statistics to make its claim, but does a bad job.
i find it hilarious you mention both the "insane amount of games" and limited user accounts on the same page.
i would also like to add that the ones you pay for do not add the "professional" into the mix, but it's the user...the admin.
it wouldn't have had anywhere near as the same effect if windows firewall was on by default which is why microsoft introduced a basic firewall.
and to throw out another twist, any linux user and recompile their own kernel, therefore we could have thousands of different versions out there.
also remember when we are talking about the linux kernel, this includes any drivers (open-source that is) the system uses.
" you don't dep is provided through software in windows too.
if you had memory protection testing suites you would know that the protection offered by pax nx emulation (pageexec) has is the same as hardware nx under windows.
who knows the distros are a huge confusing mess.
outbound filtering does not guarantee anything unless you running vista.
your statement of "windows xp" is more secure than linux isn't a relevant comparison because first you would either be comparing it to a kernel, and then next alot of operating systems.
it is emulation in the sense that no nx bit is present.
another use would be simple port blocking (or something more sophisticated) if you didn't want people behind a gateway engaging in some activity.
linux is still currently used even with only 0.37% market share, it is actively developed.
only linux could get away with fabricating some imaginary number like 29 million users based onestimating a 118k registered users!
a small detail of 57% of all vulnerabilities for windows xp beingremotely accessible (the figure for linux 2.6.x is 19%, which isn't good but still better).
so if i were managing a company, i would much rather hire people who know the os really well and pay "them" to be my support.
"the reason for the windows firewall is clear : use it to get on the internet, get your updates and security software then get rid of it."
just because some software "suite" is fooled does not make it a replacement for real nx through hardware.
ui is okeay if all used it and not used console for all.
i am glad microsoft pushed it more heavily to customers in sp2.
home users don't use ipsec, it is mainly used with vpns and ssl communications.
the longer vulnerabilities are out in the wild the more potential damage is being done.
once something has system access as admin it impossible to guarantee this.
something does not have to gain system access to severly affect your security.
the only people that would want to block skype are businesses or educational institutions.
which guarantees it will run as a limited user.
even with a cost of 5 dollars per device, the ultimate amount adds up.
"i stand by my original opinion that home users could benefit from outbound filtering.
it provides security easily and unobtrusively.
even ignoring the malicious, a user might want some notification that an application is calling home.
these unix installations mostly exist in the background, so your statistics are not valid.
according to secunia, linux kernal 2.6.x has 18 unpatched advisories, windows xp professional has 32, home edition has 29.
if you don't trust these values then don't use them at all.
"if you had memory protection testing suites you would know that the protection offered by pax nx emulation (pageexec) has is the same as hardware nx under windows."
this is why a system running dep is much less vulnerable to any exploit that uses an unknown unpatched vulnerability like this.
windows consistently benefits from new techniques, sp2 is an example as is the new security in vista.
without it dep is vulnerable to an exploit technique known as return-to-libc.
anyone can do a search to see the massive problems windows users encounter trying to run games and other applications under a limited account.
i found massively infected machines with third party firewalls and all the malicious ports and applications were allowed access.
linux has had more vulnerabilities than windows xp.
i find it hilarious how uninformed linux users are.
" not at all, stopping buffer overflow attacks prevents many exploits that malware uses to install.
end users don't all have websites and the majority probably have myspace or blog pages where they talk about anything but computers or windows or linux.
even with open source advocates finally admitting thatlinux is insecure they still try to claim it is more secure than windows.
they scare them with ridiculous fud.
nt is way beyond dos in terms of sound architecture.
the problem is so called windows "experts" irresponsibly recommend third party firewalls to people who do not need it.
the rest doesn't address security.
" port blocking is irrelevant if you are trying to block outbound activity on a windows xp machine running as an admin with a software firewall.
" well useless from the perspective of actual damage to the user, since different breaches of security effect different people in different ways.
and by the way, i use windows, linux, solaris, aix, mac os x and others.
mac os 9 and os/2 are great examples of operating systems that have close to no vulnerabilities yet provide pathetic security.
so, "red hat as4", or "suse linux enterprise server" are "operating systems".
malware authors would have to corrupt the running firewall (zonealarm, for instance) to get it to apply the same rules as it would for ie.
i use winxp at work, and i can tell you that i have not seen anything to convince me that situation has changed at all.
if games are that important to you then i would not recommend linux.
people that embrace a distro of the week attitude are just as confusing to me.
managed systems use limited accounts and setup outboundfiltering on hardware firewalls or servers.
i had a passport advantage account with ibm and even they wanted to get rid of it.
they kept it basic because outbound protection is useless running as an admin!
but telling the average user they need one is irresponsible.
since a piii is unable to play the latest games let alone the fact that linux and openbsd have next to no game support, then yes.
first i'm going to say that i sit on the fence between open source & : software is software and i don't mix politics and software for that matter.
all i was claiming was that even an unpatched windows 95 user or rhl 1.1 user still can have a "secure" computing experience.
the data is all there and linked.
"if games are that important to you then i would not recommend linux.
once you have system access there are many ways to bypass a third party firewall and with the freely available rootkits, it can easily go undetected.
outbound filtering would be useful if you had a nat configuration, and wanted to block certain activities from egressing.
regardless there is a performance hit as opposed to true nx.
the number of vulnerabilities directly relates to the security of the software out of the users control.
sorry you are not going to get away with it that easily.
i am quite certain that leaktest could run under a limited user account.
i really don't know what happened, but you clearly wasted your time if using windows games was your primary concern.
as i said, you aren't interested in any facts that upset your world view.
i do not have any stability or reliability problems with xp."
i have a computer with xp x64 that i use regularly.
i know that a billion vulnerabilities are probably waiting to be exploited, but if the user was knowledgeable, and had no one malicious on the local network or using the machine locally what security issues are there?
so yeah, focus your beady little eyes on secunia-statistics.
i don't compile my own software, unless there is a special situation that truly requires it.
yes, you can download the os and software but the ones that you have to use professionally cost big time and lets centralize all at one place (it takes me back to the 70s, 80s).
my point is that microsoft tends to deliver suboptimal solutions later than competitors, despite their financial advantages.
that won't change the fact that linux and all the gnu/linux distributions are miles ahead of windows xp.
for whatever reason this is never talked about and linux gets this magic aura of invulnerability.
i used to have a handheld laptop like device from lg that ran ce, but i have not seen it since.
i work with end users daily and they simply say yes and let everything connect.
"another use would be simple port blocking (or something more sophisticated) if you didn't want people behind a gateway engaging in some activity.
that just shows even clearly how little you know.
beyond that, the costs per device is what matters.
not all followed and some users were still running legacy games.
most people wouldn't check and when you look in the program control section you would find two separate programs, one would be the real internet explorer the other would be ie.exe using the same exact icon but be a malicious program!
at least it would raise the bar significantly.
yes aslr is better which is why vista comes with it.
which is why the market share remains at a pathetic 0.37% even with it being "free".
following up, noting the comment from paletteguy, linux "can" be cheaper, but not if you are interested and set on paying one of the well known companies for support for one of the pricey versions of a linux powered operating system.
"the resources for game developers are there.
if you consult secunia on a product like os/2 you will see that not a single vulnerability is noted.
to simplify things i took the latestlinux kernel v2.6.x and compared it to windows xp.
and you can certainly use gui's (well defined ones i might add) for desktop or server use.
for whatever reason this is never talked about and linux gets this magic aura of invulnerability.
that is idiotic and impossible on windows xp running as an admin.
anything can be blocked if you are running the firewall on separate secure server or from a good hardware firewall.
granted that i have not taken the time to count individual vulnerabilities so all these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt.
i will admit, the windows firewall does a good job of stealthing inbound ports.
third party vendors still have to catch up and make compatible products.
most of the unpatched vulnerabilities in windows are blocked with dep protection enabled anyway, the rest via a firewall and none do anything in a limited user environment which is what it runs their user base in.
what is widely acknowleged is their is alot of online hype that does not relate to the actual security environment in the real world.
"a good commercial firewall would most likely fill in the gaps left by the windows firewall.
xp is a vast improvement over previous windows versions but it is still less stable and reliable than linux.
maybe some linux zealot told you how linux is the best operating system out there for anyone.
outbound filtering would be useful if you had a nat configuration, and wanted to block certain activities from egressing."
skype had proven to be a notoriously hard thing to block.
yes, if a user is running as an administrator, anything they run could theoretically disable the firewall, antivirus or other software.
only true hardware nx can guarantee dep or pax. pax is just as questionable but it is better than no pax just like dep is better than no dep and dep with nx is better than regular dep.
if you pick a good distribution like rhel, or its free relative fedora core, the software is compiled with these protections built in.
i don't think that windows is inherently insecure.
something like "linux doesn't let me play my games and i will therefore find other evidence that it is bad" would have been more fitting.
" outbound filtering causes some of the most problems for home users.
very few linux users actually get their software directly from the site of origin.
they do whatever is easier.
now if you start looking into and adding up linux "distribution" vulnerabilities that can take you into thehundreds upon hundreds of security holes that are never talked about.
a good commercial firewall would most likely fill in the gaps left by the windows firewall.
finally take a look at the most severe unpatched secunia advisory rating.
for a small scale smtp or dns server it's nice to know that if djbdns or qmail get out of control technology like pax, execshield, or apparmor will give you an additional layer of protection.
anything can bypass any firewall once it has compromised your system logged in as an administrator!
dep (or pax) only shine when you are running a server or a multiuser machine.
stop regurgitating nonsense you read on open source sites.
"impartial analysis of popular trends and technology" copyright Â© 2004-2011 popular technology anyone who tracks security vulnerability reports knows of the ridiculous amount that reference holes in linux.
i still credit the pax authors for their deep understanding of the features of a multitude of different processors: alpha, i386, ia64, mips, mips64, parisc, ppc, ppc64, sparc, sparc64 and x86_64.
with sophisticated stateful firewalls like iptables or pf, you can analyze relationships that normally would be ignored to its usage of inconspicuous ports and other obfuscation techniques.
this is about security not the fact of the insane amount of games i can run on windows xp or the pathetic0.37% market share linux has.
if you are serious about security then you understand the nature of the advisories and work around them.
if you have a genuine problem with linux (or its security) other then that it cannot play *windows* games, then tell everyone.
i have had it set off alarms due to small updates to ie that change its executable hash somewhat.
i can give you facts, but you won't like them so there is no point.
the more i talk to linux users the more i realize they are simply fed propaganda and have no real world windows experience.
but how many websites have a word in it, hardly represents the usage.
from a security standpoint it does nothing to prevent you from getting infected since you already have to be infected for it to try and connect out.
amazing how tech trends go back and forth ;), and moreover when dealing with "high availability", clustering proved to be an effective approach at this.
but i manage windows workstations and do not have any security problems.
i find it incredible to read that your employed in it and you find the patch turnaround time to be irrelevant.
well in reading the comments posted, there are people here that are much more qualified than i. however, the article, while pointing out the security issues with an os versus just the kernel is not accurate.
even microsoft's web site states that in software mode, dep only provides some protection from certain error handling conditions.
the evidence is balanced and the facts are weighed up.
"but the rest of the gnu-linux os (no matter what disttro you use), has little to offer in terms of serious vulnerabilities, since most things run in user-space.
in linux the root password (on setting it that way) has to be provided, preventing random programs to generate things.
i am just impressed that linux has withstood all these attacks.
you seem obsessed with being able to play games.
secondly, you get what you pay for typically in other products (with exceptions) and well for the price we pay for windows, it should be much better, work smoothly, however, it often has more errors than one knows what to do with, and we can not forget those times that files are randomly changed to read only, or moved even by windows.
security companies make their money by selling these scary stories.
anyone who claims xp is unstable has no business using computers ever again.
the secunia total advisory rating is useless since the grouping makes any analysis from the advisories irrelevant.
microsoft's isa would probably come closest.
i have had it set off alarms due to small updates to ie that change its executable hash somewhat."
first, for a simple home computer, windows cost an arm, but now will cost an arm and a leg, where as linux, can be downloaded for free, or a much smaller fee (compared to windows) can be paid.
if i were to put this windows 95 user behind a hardware firewall, gave them a modern web browser, and educated them on secure practices i can see no security issues.
no it is not scientific, but at least acknowledge that linux is big, and here to stay.
instead of giving them accurate security advice.
nope you keep using it since its security is excellent.
actually my concern is security, which linux has proven to be no better than it's misleading claims.
outbound filtering causes some of the most problems for home users.
see http://www.grc.com/lt/leaktest.htm for an example of an application that can completely bypass the windows firewall."
nokia has a new internet tablet.
finally, if you wanted to be truely fair about these comparisons, you have to weigh the severity of each noted type of exploit in some fashion and assign it a score based on severity, ease, maybe even risk, and then sum up the scores of these to make a serious risk.
you also ignored the fact linux had this protection before windows xp even came out.
" once something has system access as admin it impossible to guarantee this.
outboung filtering on a firewall is trying to stop something that has already infected you.
" the average user does not care.
show me documented reproduceable proof that proves the windows xp sp2 firewall does not provide adequate security.
yeah they got it right, don't have any games for anyone to run.
"yes, if a user is running as an administrator, anything they run could theoretically disable the firewall, antivirus or other software."
andrew "linux is not more stable and reliable than xp.
you are supposed to weigh up the facts with evidence in a balanced manner and then form a conclusion based on your findings.
the great thing about linux is that it can complement or replace your existing unix installations without the upheaval that switching to windows would entail.
"the other excuse, that a process could masquerade as another has been thoroughly dealt with by the likes of executable hashing that even rudimentary free firewalls like zonealarm offer.
only a fanboy could not understand why it is important to show how insecure linux really is!
it still provides protection.
