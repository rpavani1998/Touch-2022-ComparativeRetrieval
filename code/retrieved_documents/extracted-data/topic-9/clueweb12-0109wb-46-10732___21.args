conclusion: respondents from both sides admitted to not liking to deal with installation, no matter how easy it might seem.
we can not find anyone who knows how to do things that are simple in ms windowswe can not find anyone who knows how to do things that are simple in ms windows - vendors can not make any money from linux users - some linux vendors do not support linux - can't buy help desk support contract for linux
conclusion: both sides of the opinion gap believe that their preferred platform costs least to maintain none offered any concrete proof.
linux requires on-site development staff or contractors to fix serious bugs and to apply kernel patches (3 mentions) ultimately linux using sites need to out-source support since a company can not rely on internal staff to remain current on all issues ms powerpoint is the best presentation tool (everyone uses it) (10 mentions)
conclusion: more evidence of a knowledge gap, although the criticism of difficulty of linux deployment seems like an informed comment.
there are no financial applications for linux (myob and quicken were mentioned: the issue raised was the ability to export data to users of these two applications.
comment: i flew seated next to the ceo of an isp who told me his whole company runs on linux, that his company never had a problem with a linux user and that over 95% of support staff time is taken up helping ms windows users to do things that are very simple to do!
we can never be certain which microsoft patches need to be installed: too many to choose from don't trust ms patches because of many instances of downtime caused by faulty patches linux offers great interoperability
the assertion that windows 2000 server supports larger files was based on the understanding that linux has a 2gb file size limit.
this interview was the perfect vehicle to reinforce the message that linux is the best means of reducing the cost of ownership of an it infrastructure.

- applications works faster and smoother - linux applications and tools are better for the job - linux desktop has more choices pro-windows perceptions: ms windows is the most used os platform isps do not support linux (pacbell mentioned directly) linux users are know-it-alls (softened form of real term used)
we can not do without ms outlook client - you can not buy ms exchange server for linux - linux is not compatible with the internet explorer 6 standard - can't buy a decent live email backup client for linux like the one we bought for outlook -
it was disappointing that several answers related to linux as a server platform, not as a desktop tool.

it is possible to build a whole application in pgaccess, just as can be done with ms access.
the cost of acquisition of a complete linux based solution (server) is much lower than an equivalent microsoft windows solution.
linux is daunting to new users windows is more predictable than linux is windows xp pro is easier to deploy (esp.
ease of installation: pro-linux perceptions: linux gui installers are easier to use than ms windows xp's installation process linux mass roll-out is easier (requires fewer staff) and is less costly than windows xp linux installation is a once only affair pro-windows perceptions: linux means i have to get rid of all current software and deploy all new stuff -- means i can not use my existing ms windows application servers nearly all new machines come pre-installed with windows everyone (users) know how to install ms windows software, with linux i'd need and army to install applicationseveryone (users) know how to install ms windows software, with linux i'd need and army to install applications -

there are very few linux applications we can not do without ms outlook client you can not buy ms exchange server for linux linux is not compatible with the internet explorer 6 standard can't buy a decent live email backup client for linux like the one we bought for outlook
cost: the economic environment is tough and it budgets are being cut linux is free (10 mentions)
conclusion: both sides of the opinion gap believe that their preferred platform costs least to maintain none offered any concrete proof.
when i mentioned industry standards compliance he replied that i should just accept the fact that what everyone uses is the standard.

- gdi printers - winmodems - video cards - pcmcia cards software support: pro-linux perceptions: community help is fast and free one can use vnc to support both linux and ms windows network clients linux software is easier to keep up to date linux has the best remote administration tools (like rsh, ssh, webmin)linux has the best remote administration tools (like rsh, ssh, webmin)
postgresql/mysql are better and faster one can comfortably use older hardware with linux (it is fast and lesser hardware)
linux users do not know how to use dial-up networking ms windows networks can not be browsed from linux workstations linux is immature will cause high costs in the long run
the observations were not based on any actual comparison with ms sql server.
there are lots of reputable 3rd party companies that produce (anti-)virus software.

comment: the is a native linux/unix tool that can replace ms access.
pro-windows perceptions: linux is not secure, after all it is made by back-yard hackers!
pgaccess has an interface to sql data tables, forms, reports, views, schema manipulation, stored procedures and scripts, as well as user management capabilities.
conclusion: clearly, the anti-linux sentiment is reflective of pro-linux opinions that alienated the pro-windows people.
fear of exposure is the key factor here.
also, it seems obvious to me that with win4lin and vmware one has to pay for this software as well as pay for the ms windows license so why not just run ms windows on the users' pc?
there are not unified linux network management tools: nothing like microsoft mmc ms windows has the more mature rapid deployment tools (eg: norton ghost) linux is way too complicated comment/conclusion: we are still suffering a knowledge gap.

it seems that linux companies have not managed to get this message across at all.
i also asked the pro-ie6 respondent how compatible his ie5.5 and ie5 systems were with ie6 and he could not see the point of my question.
applications: the linux graphical interface is just as easy to use as ms windows linux uses industry standards compliant protocols -- industry standard file formats also
ms windows requires on-site support staff.
ms sql is the best, it is fast and easy to configure windows 2000 server supports bigger files old hardware is unreliable and should not be used linux has no answer for ms terminal server windows 2000 server is not the faster file and print server, but it is 100% compatible!
additionally, ms windows specialists knew only of telnet and hated it!
the cost of acquisition of a complete linux based solution (server) is much lower than an equivalent microsoft windows solution.
ms windows requires on-site support staff.
using vmware (4 mentions) comment: corel photodraw appears to be a discontinued commercial product and it is not free.
for 1,000's of desktop installations) comment: the linux is daunting comment came from an administrator who had not used linux in over 2 years.
he claimed that a single auto-install profile for ms windows xp professional roll-out could meet the needs of all workstations and that he was more familiar with rolling out ms windows than linux.
the linux development environment is free and very powerful (4 mentions) -- no vendor lock-in (2 mentions) all needed business applications are available for linux corel photodraw for linux is free (1 mention

conclusion: there is a big gap in the area of 'trust' , some of which is due to lack of exposure and lack of familiarity.
comment: i flew seated next to the ceo of an isp who told me his whole company runs on linux, that his company never had a problem with a linux user and that over 95% of support staff time is taken up helping ms windows users to do things that are very simple to do!
and that means that the companies that produce them are going to miss out on purchase decisions made by the growing number of pro-linux buyers.
linux has no obscure protocols/services makes it easier to lock down linux us not vulnerable to worms
linux is more productivelinux is more productive - linux applications are better for the job - the linux desktop offers more choices comment: the comment of abuse of ms windows users is a foolish jab that alienates and does nothing to bridge the credibility gap!comment: the comment of abuse of ms windows users is a foolish jab that alienates and does nothing to bridge the credibility gap!
comment: the comment pertaining to samba was based on a web search and not from experience, the fact is that locking problems could easily also be experienced with ms windows (and the respondent knew that but was of the opinion that if samba could not solve problems that ms windows has then there is no reason to use it).

windows 2000 supports files of up to 4terabytes, linux 2.4.x with the xfs or jfs file systems support much larger files than ms windows 2000, but i am not aware of anyone who has hit either limits for ms windows 2000 or for recent linux implementations (samba is limited by the file system on which it runs).
(1 mention) use of a crm application that requires ms sql, so it is cheaper to have just one platform.
equally, the pro-windows respondents are unwilling to weight the real cost of the liabilities of their current infrastructure solutions this leads to an unwillingness to seriously consider alternatives.
it seems that linux companies have not managed to get this message across at all.
pro-windows perceptions: microsoft funded idc report that claims that the linux tco - 13% higher than an equivalent ms windows solution (3 mentions) linux requires on-site techies to keep systems running (2 mentions) linux requires on-site development staff or contractors to fix serious bugs and to apply kernel patches (3 mentions) ultimately linux using sites need to out-source support since a company can not rely on internal staff to remain current on all issues ms powerpoint is the best presentation tool (everyone uses it) (10 mentions)
