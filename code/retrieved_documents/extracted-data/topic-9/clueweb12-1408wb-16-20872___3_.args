the kernel maintains caches of many things, and disk data is something where a lot of work is done to keep everything fast and efficient.since i use both windows and linux boxes on a regular basis, i am fairly familiar with the physical existence of both, and that each operating system has its own fundamental peculiarities in how they are setup and how they are secured.what i think is most interesting about his view point into the security of linux is: linux exists in an environment where there is broad collaboration, but no effort to validate the collaborators so the opportunity for traditional, old style, data breach is immeasurable.we know that pretexting is wide-spread, how much easier (and harder to catch and convict) if the person doing the pretexting doesn't even have to come up with a real fake identity?if you are using linux and haven't done a physical security audit in a while and specifically looked at who is collaborating with whom, i would say it is likely well past time.the easy path here would be to present the different security models for the different distributions but, for this purpose, i'm going to leave linux in abstract and talk about the unique security problem it represents.the kernel maintains caches of many things, and disk data is something where a lot of...invalidating the linux buffer cache when you write data, it doesn't necessarily get written to disk right then.when we hire someone for a company, it is pretty standard to run a state level criminal background check (there are a couple of companies i know that don't do this, but most do).sourcerob enderle he is right, nothing is safe as long as a person is involved, and since people are involved in just about everything, then just about nothing is secure.the geek.com reports: the free software foundation may ban novell from selling new invalidating the linux buffer cache when you write data, it doesn't necessarily get written to disk right then.i stumbled across this analysis of the linux kernel which brought back "fond" memories of my market opportunity forecasting days.in the analysis, the author, kripken, estimates that "at most, 60% of the linux kernel... novell could loose access to new linux versions make a deal with a big closed source company and the fsf (free software foundation) may pull your access rights to linux distro's.about linuxdevelopernews get the lastest information on current changes in the linux development world.no i am not bashing rob, but i did find his paper "the five things you aren't allowed to discuss about linux" to be interesting from the technological view point.
