with a free operating system, a community of cooperating hackers would be able to use a computer without starting to deprive his or her friend.ubuntu linux is not only much secure than windows os, but it also includes free apps and renders safe and fast web browsing.linux here is substantially cheaper, as it is an open-source system, and most of its applications are also under gnu public licenses – in other words, free.most of these distributors add up their own features, targeting specific areas like enterprise, desktop, multimedia etc., to the existing gnu system, to cater diverse user sections.you have the freedom to distribute modified versions of the program, so that the community can benefit from your improvements.however, cross-platform scripting will never give the smooth performance that a program does when run on its native platform – it is a bit like using emulators to run programs that are not native to the os.a. linux is free and it comes with a licence known as “gnu gpl”, which grants free use, free access to the source code (linux distributions often come with both binaries and the source code), freedom to copy, modify and distribute it.while this is demonstrably true – think of the millions of viruses for windows systems, and the rare bug that crops up in linux – it is also true that efficient server administration can render a windows system as secure as a linux one.this software is very easy to use and you can create professional documents, spreadsheets and presentations.with gnu/linux, you are in general connect as a user to restricted access, and you pass as a root (i.e. administrator under windows) when you must change important parameters of the system or regulate the hardware configuration or add or remove a program.depending on your budget, security concerns and familiarity with the computer language, you can pick either of them and successfully run a dynamic website for a long time to come.php, however, is still one of the most popular scripts around thanks to its versatility and the solid, useful applications being written using it.windows hosting comes with the added cost of the os, and certain applications that the hosting company has to continually pay for.(to make this freedom effective in practice, you must have access to the source code, since making changes in a program without having the source code is exceedingly difficult.)with this solution you can safeguard the remainder of your personal and software data on a second partition.
