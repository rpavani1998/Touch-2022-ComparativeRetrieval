we love linux because we love it, because it provides the most efficient free and open source alternative(according to me by the way), because we love the community it provides, because everyday it grows more than any other os in the world.as a result, you often have to put in quite a bit of work to make open source projects compile on non-linux systems.regardless of how good a solution they may or may not be, the mere fact that these solutions have been created is clear proof that the original unix design itself was not as ‘secure’ as some people seem to think.the people who hate microsoft/windows use linux simply because it is the most obvious option, not because they really thought about what kind of os suits their needs best.i think there is some irony in that: a lot of people use windows simply because it is the most obvious option, not because they really thought about what kind of os suits their needs best.however, once you’ve done that, they still compile on linux, so there is no reason why they wouldn’t have made it more portable and compatible in the first place.we are going to stick with it, contribute to it and make it more better and more efficient.a true it professional knows how to use both, knows their best role, and actually contributes something to the craft instead of fighting with zeal against the tyranny of the other side.at the very least, it gives an interesting historical context of acl support in linux and related oses.it has the largest userbase, as a result, the average linux user is also less knowledgeable than other *nix users.as a sane, reasonable it professional i am aware of the weaknesses of all of my tools and i spend my time improving things rather than arguing which is better.he seems to think that linux is the blueprint for all oses everywhere, so his limited knowledge of things such as access control lists based on half-baked linux add-ons makes him an expert on windows as well.as a result, you often find open source applications that *should* be portable, but aren’t.so in a way they’re no better than the windows users they despise for “not thinking about the os they choose”.so even though you may have acl support in the filesystem, and ‘everything is a file’, you still lack some control there.
