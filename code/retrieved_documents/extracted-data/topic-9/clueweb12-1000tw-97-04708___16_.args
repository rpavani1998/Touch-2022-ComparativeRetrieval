but linux is free, has easy access to lots of free software, no-one can be bothered to write viruses for it (not that they would have an easy time anyway), and can have several advantages in specific situations.it has pro level networking options and makes great low-overhead servers.linux affords a degree of freedom which makes it difficult to go back to anything else.while the programs that run on top of linux can be hacked or damaged, there is little to no fear of your kernal being compromised (unless you have an easy password to crack), so it is great for things where you are not sure what you are getting yourself into.if you don't care about gaming and are some what proficient with a computer, linux can be a very powerful os.the developers have also invested some effort to "fight bufferbloat", which is a scenario of latency and throughput issues that are caused by excessive buffering.windows is better for games, but only because it is the only os that the majority of pc games can be played on.according to the published changelog, version 3.3 improves the handling of intel's rc6 power saving mode, which enables linux to reliably work with sandy bridge graphics units.it use to be great for tinkering with to get your computer to do things it otherwise would not be able to do... but now it is so easy to develop on windows that there is little point.with linux though, the gui is pretty different and you're able to do more things with commands, much like the ms dos days.byte queue limits are introduced to help solve the problem and enables developers to set a configurable limit of packet data.the only major difference between linux and windows for casual use is that m$ doesn't have a linux version of office, you don't have ie, and there can be difficulties on linux because of software patents on audio or video codecs (or the likes of css for dvds).it use to have more advantages over windows than it does now.it uses the linux kernel, making it linux-based.the kernel 3.3 now also includes a nvme driver, which acts as an interface for ssds via pci or pcie.
