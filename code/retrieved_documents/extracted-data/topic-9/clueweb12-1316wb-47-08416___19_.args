it provides security easily and unobtrusively.a firewall's main purpose is to provide security from attacks and the windows xp sp2 firewall is an excellent solution that does just that.xp is a vast improvement over previous windows versions but it is still less stable and reliable than linux.linux has had more vulnerabilities than windows xp.mac os 9 and os/2 are great examples of operating systems that have close to no vulnerabilities yet provide pathetic security.the great thing about linux is that it can complement or replace your existing unix installations without the upheaval that switching to windows would entail.the number of vulnerabilities directly relates to the security of the software out of the users control.this is why a system running dep is much less vulnerable to any exploit that uses an unknown unpatched vulnerability like this.most of the unpatched vulnerabilities in windows are blocked with dep protection enabled anyway, the rest via a firewall and none do anything in a limited user environment which is what it runs their user base in.the time to develop, test and publish a patch is irrelevant since this data can easily be manipulated and the testing of a linux patch does not effect anywhere near the amount or scope of windows users and software.blocking the wrong service can lead to the internet appearing as if it's unreachable.thirdly, windows allows any program really to change the registry and has no security features to prevent that like linux does.once you have system access there are many ways to bypass a third party firewall and with the freely available rootkits, it can easily go undetected.first of all, you would have a much better support team as they would really know the product, being the linux powered operating system of choice, and secondly if you doled out the support costs of one of these enterprise class operating systems to your staff who are to support the os, you would have much more longevity out of your employees, and there would be much less turnover."it is a widely accepted fact that the windows firewall offers no protection against outbound connections which offers no protection against phone-home attacks which means personal data could window up in the hands of those who would like to exploit it."
