linux compares very well to other unixes,  due to its open status.
because for many users, non-"copylefted" software is offensive, linux also has a vast collection of freeware programs.

that's because of cooperative  multitasking, as opposed to linux's preemptive multitasking.

changing, recompiling, and other modifications that can only be done under unix  systems and not under windows makes linux an operating system that can be  configured to do and be just about anything.
here is a few of my favorite programs that didn't come with my distribution... - woven goods for linux has a fair collection of linux apps in a well categorized list.
although the windows 95 box says 4 megs, the os  can't even fit itself in 4 megs, and gets swapped in and out, without any  programs running.
all you have to do to learn that one's user interface is a personal preference is to listen to a mac vs. windows spam-debate on usenet.
another myth about open oses in general is that they  are insecure, which is based on the thought that its weeknesses are exposed in  its source code.
linux is pc-exclusive linux was created on a pc running minix, a  smaller unix clone.
the fact is, just like those  text mode shells, linux support graphical x window system shells for terminal  machines.
linux applications support  as many file formats, if not more than other platforms.
the installation can be handled manually, in  which case it may take a while (this would be copying each file set, and  unpacking them by hand).
there's some to download, which compares very well to lousy mac and  windows office software like works (except with full justify ).
when a programmer is  going to create an application, he or she will have to decide what file formats  to support.
linux's command prompt is worse than dos's linux, like unix,  lets you choose your command prompt.
a better statement may be that linux's command  prompts are like dos's on steroids: they support redirection operators,  scripts, and command prompt functions!
here is some information on java and linux: - java-linux porting project: has general information about the java port to linux.
most linux  distributions come with a huge collection of software, certainly more than  you'd find in windows or macos.
[freeware, gpl] - window programming environment: ok, it did come with my distribution, but doesn't come with many others.
there's bash and tcsh, which are both  clones of various unix shells.
software & developmentsoftware, and the development of it, is great under linux.
newer linux software shows respect for older software standards for fast usage, and combines those tools with modern styles to make software easy to learn.
additional myths i'm sure there are myths i haven't mentioned here.
there is -- the x window system.
if you think dos is the operating system  of the future, enjoy its compact design.
how likely is it that the bug would have been exposed, if he weren't able to  download the security-related source and inspect it.
6-7-1997 the linux desktop is klunky and unattractive new!
alas, nt takes up more memory than any other  operating system to date, and mac system's usage is comparable to 3.1's, which  takes up about as much as linux.
linux is preemptive through and  through.
while windows 95 and linux take up similar amounts of hard-drive space, linux has much more packed into the disk space used.
there are two  ways an operating system can be big.
standard file formats are not accepted by linux what file formats are  and aren't supported is really up the applications.
the compatibility myths are fueled by those who believe windows is  the only operating system that is compatible, and therefore by default linux  must not be compatible with other standards.
some of the widgets are super, and it's a very fast interface.
while linux can be made to have a  challenging installation & setup, most distributions take care of it for  you.
linux distributions comes with all the development software, internet software (besides netscape), and system-related software you'll need.
linux supports fully preemptive threads for all programs and scripts that request it!
standard file formats are not accepted by linuxwhat file formats are and aren't supported is really up the applications.
using the term loosely, they do.
sometimes, if you have defective hardware that other operating systems don't  take advantage of, linux will crash.
on the other hand, with a closed  system like rhapsody or windows nt, only crackers ("hackers")  actually reverse engineer the code to exploit its security issues.
claiming an os  should remain stable when your memory doesn't retain information is  unrealistic.
6-21-1997 compatibility linux only supports linux executables new!
linux is an insecure operating systemgenerally, unix-like systems have a reputation of being insecure.
after getting a linux cd, you'll probably be up  and running within an hour.
linux compares very well to other unixes, due to its open status.
however, when its code is readily obtainable, more experts are  likely to download it and report its bugs.
it's a great programming editor, for both x and  charecter mode.
linux only supports linux executables natively, linux supports minix,  system v, a.out, and elf executable formats.
of all the fictional linux myths, these are probably the most untrue.
linux doesn't support javajust like any other modern unix, linux supports java applications with kernel integration to the interpreter, compiles java applications and applets, and has java-enabled web browsers (such as netscape).
connecting it to the internet takes about 10 minutes.
[archivist's note: the mydesktop.gif file originally linked here is now unavailable.]
based on what i have seen in on-line newspapers, magazines, newsgroups, and on the web, i have compiled a list of false-myths about linux, and i explain where (if at all) these myths are based, and what the facts are.
