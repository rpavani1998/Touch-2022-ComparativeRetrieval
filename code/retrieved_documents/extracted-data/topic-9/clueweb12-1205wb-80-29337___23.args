don't care for it though.
the guys who don't like linux come with things like "linux is less compatible."
almost certainly, because only people who really wanted to work as performing musicians would stick it out.
i find it amazing you forget the idiot proof point and click gui for every microsoft program.
i get that i could get more use out of a linux machine.
they haven't really jumped any boats.
now if some of you people like windows, thats great.
consider that "linux" of course refers to the kernel and the history of linux kernel development is unprecedented.
i think it already has a robust and sustainable user base and that people will continue to be attracted to it in the future just like they were in the past.
but the issues there have very little to do with ease of use desktop-y issues, and which distro does what how.
i laugh and my first thought is to the animal farm; human nature, being what it is.
if i want to be sure it is supported i buy stuff that i know works.
then you get no support, of course, which might be hassle if you are running a commercial server and cannot afford me (actually you could probably afford me, but get the picture).
i think you could always give red hat money for support, which is what they are selling now.
that is funny - i would bet money that linux runs on more systems than windows does.

mk, i'm in college, working full time, and married with a 2 year old.
it's for businesses, servers, that kind of stuff.
especially if you are working over a network via ssh, in which case you get no gui.
for those who are happy without it, that's great.
like i said, there are no shareholders who will benefit, it's not a stock you can purchase, so achieving a greater market share is just a macho goal.
you'd be better off doing sudoku on the couch.
yeah, i can still install multiple programs at the terminal with one line while you go and download and install all of the applications separately.
linux is not fast food, and it is not a commercial product.
sittin' on the dock of the bay posts 8,176 originally posted by lpaulgib i really do get it.
also, the point was that most linux distros have preinstalled free fully functional office programs/suites (be it ooo or gnumeric + abiword, or whatever else), not chopped down trial versions.
if i were running a server or anything requiring real work, i'd go with linux.
if only someone had the gumption and foresight to foresee what pure greed would do to "the entertainment industry", we'd probably be living in a much more interesting world.
i know of it because it was the only program that ran word documents on linux at the time.
as an aside, i am kind of glad some things are not compatible with linux.
linux does a horrible job of selling itself.
good thing only one file is needed then, an .exe or an .msi, you have fun with you dependencies then ;-) how i need a drink, alcoholic in nature, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics.
so often people are encouraged to switch to linux (when windows worked fine for them) - they try it and, after a bad experience, they not only turn away, but have scorn for it too.
they forked into fedora, which is more or less the same thing, and kept the brandname for redhat, which the money you pay is for support.
looks like they jumped the boat.
it would be very hard to make all that money if you actually had towork for it.
almost certainly, because only people who really wanted to work as performing musicians would stick it out.
part of the purpose of distro package management is to correct such errors by individual developers.
burning an iso off a pre-installed windows to undo what has been done for them makes no sense.
it's a pain in the ass to hunt down a good distro, burn the iso's, lose everything i already have.....only to gain something that isn't as compatable, has less support, and doesn't really do anything that i need to do.
keep doing that and they just might conform, like good consumers it's a pain in the ass to hunt down a good distro, burn the iso's, i suppose it was easier to earn the $1000 bucks you paid for the computer so that you can treat it as another opportunity to turn your brain off because you are too tired to think from earning the money you need to buy all these toys and tools that make your life "easier".
i can install linux on any machine, run my little installation script and tweak the power settings and that's it.
i have no problem with that, but don't go bashing linux guys because it is the cool thing to be anti-linux.
redhat is still (by necessity) all gpl licensed software, so there is nothing illegal about "pirating" it.
it would be cheaper to just get a computer which is 25% faster.
this knowledge typically presents a steep learning curve and for those who don't care to learn what it takes, it is an insurmountable obstacle.
i think the problems you think might be corrected by attending to such a goal are not really problems with the system, they are just because you are new to it.
the distro's also keep track of security risks and other problems -- they are contributing a very significant oversight layer.

i just want to click a giant logo and see entertaining stuff.
i don't get mad if i buy something with hardware that does not work on linux.
then, subsequent to all that, you can use the standard interface offered the package manager (by which i mean, yum or apt) to query stuff like what files a package installed, where they are located, etc. yum: repoquery --list package apt: dpkg-query -l package ba-boom, done.
i figure if someone wants to learn all the little things it takes to get a linux system up an running, they will, they will stick with it, and they will get there under their own steam.
someone earlier mentioned the office suite i think.
also it's a great way to understand the fundamental elements of the system.
openoffice.org... works on windows too you know.
so you have skipped a few steps that have to occur before you get to the apparently easy point and click, which you can save yourself all that trouble with one quick powerful command.
then you get no support, of course, which might be hassle if you are running a commercial server and cannot afford me (actually you could probably afford me, but get the picture).

as an analogy, think what would happen if musicians had to actually perform instead of just collecting royalties, because all their recorded material was freely reproducible under law.
i don't think "what america wants" deserves any kind of attention at all unlessyou are out to make money feeding animals deep fried cheese.

originally posted by lpaulgib i would think it's a problem of linux having too many different distros.
i have friends who have windows computers at home and the whole family uses them and such and i'd be nuts to think i'd be doing them a favor by recommending they switch to linux.
like i said, there are no shareholders who will benefit, it's not a stock you can purchase, so achieving a greater market share is just a macho goal.
the jail here afaict has to do withintellectual property laws, which gnu is dead set against particularly as it has come to be applied to software.
take your marketeer savviness to kfc and point/click at the big shiny board over the counter.
i just think it's unfair to paint windows in this light like it's the most junk thing in the world.
so free as in "out of jail" and not necessarily "cost $0".
i think it already has a robust and sustainable user base and that people will continue to be attracted to it in the future just like they were in the past.
like i said before, the distro's are 99% identical once you understand the system.
anyway, i consider this: apt-cache search some_package apt-get install package easier than: - finding a website - downloading a package - playing with some wonky gui interface that may be different each time.
and i would love to see linux get in the game and take up a good portion of the market and have the right resources easily at my disposal.
i bought an hp computer with windows 7, and i am sick and tired of the nagware put on there by hp and norton (again, this is not the fault of microsoft - at least not directly) that i actually hate booting into windows.
they forked into fedora, which is more or less the same thing, and kept the brandname for redhat, which the money you pay is for support.
fedora branched off and basically became free red hat.
the only reason i use windows is to run dragon naturally speaking - now that nuance makes a dictation product for macs, i see no reason to keep a windows install around at all.

there's so much more to tweak and so much more time and effort required with a fresh install of windows.
like i said before, the distro's are 99% identical once you understand the system.
it's for businesses, servers, that kind of stuff.
anyway, i wouldn't assume about all that, you are just repeating bland cliches about what users "want".
i just think it's unfair to paint windows in this light like it's the most junk thing in the world.
instead of being the most snobby, it's who's the most geeky.
windows comes pre-installed on most pcs, is geared towards the masses, and is available.
now i will grant that things are a lot better these days, (i even know a 60+ year old lady who got ubuntu working for herself) but there is still a lot to know to make the linux experience pleasant.
quiet technologies... that make some noise.
but the issues there have very little to do with ease of use desktop-y issues, and which distro does what how.

you're a programmer, that tish shouldn't scare you.

"""oooh you can command line multiple downloads""" ""oooh you can look at nothing but text on bash and uninstall things more thoroughly""".
looks like they jumped the boat.
