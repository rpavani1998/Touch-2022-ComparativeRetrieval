that feature alone must account in large degree for the dearth of viruses and other malicious vermin on linux and unix platforms.the system defaults to protecting the operating system components from its user’s actions (intentional or otherwise).the system defaults to protecting the operating system components from its users actions (intentional or otherwise).in particular, the notion of an administrative (root) user that maintains and operates the system, and desktop users who only run the software on the system, is completely ingrained in most linux distributions.but my point here is that linux does follow the security features and capabilities it inherited from unix quite closely.then, following a brief foray in os/2, i quickly gravitated to running linux at home so i could once again have a real multi-tasking working environment.now its true that many linux users ignore these features and run all their software from a root-level account anyway, but thats a choice that theyve made.windows, on the other hand, started life as a single user system, with that single user being all-powerful.to complete that trifecta, i guess it’s only fair to compare the end-user data security aspects of windows against linux.to complete that trifecta, i guess its only fair to compare the end-user data security aspects of windows against linux.i was constantly frustrated by the frequent reboots, lack of serious security capabilities (from my perspective), and such.check out the new article, is linux really more secure than windows?, to see what the findings are ... you might be surprised (or not).however, i consider myself very open-minded and will always give credit where its due.however, i consider myself very open-minded and will always give credit where it’s due.i’m more secure on linux than i am on windows.
