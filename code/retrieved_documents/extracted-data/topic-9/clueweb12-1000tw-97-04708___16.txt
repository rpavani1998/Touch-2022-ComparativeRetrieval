while the programs that run on top of linux can be hacked or damaged, there is little to no fear of your kernal being compromised (unless you have an easy password to crack), so it is great for things where you are not sure what you are getting yourself into.

makes life waaay easier (yes, easier, as in takes less time, more efficient) than windows coding in my experience.
the nouveau driver package for nvidia nva3 (and up) gpus now supports audio output via hdmi.
rather, it makes it seem like you have no clue.
the kernel developers said that some subsystems and features are already available again and more will become available in the future.
6:21 am hide - 1 + anyway, i'd like to see kernel 3.4 asap, it's supposed to fix power issues with android x86; the damn thing only gives me 30-90 min of battery life on my netbook (4-5 hours on windows/ubuntu 11.04).
also noteworthy is the return of android subsystem and feature code.
the kernel 3.3 now also includes a nvme driver, which acts as an interface for ssds via pci or pcie.
do you have to have ms office?
amd evergreen gpus now also support audio output via hdmi.
" that's why i hate linux.

it isn't better than windows for a home user.
it also use to be clunkey and hard to use for every-day stuff...
the only major difference between linux and windows for casual use is that m$ doesn't have a linux version of office, you don't have ie, and there can be difficulties on linux because of software patents on audio or video codecs (or the likes of css for dvds).

it's good for servers but i can't see why anyone would use it as a daily operating system.
i have a rather high-end machine and everything is supported (kind of).
it use to have a very clean ui, which has now been cluttered in most versions.
ever use a flat screen hdtv?
most of them are also running linux.
it has the best of both worlds.
it uses the linux kernel, making it linux-based.
i think that the best way to try linux is to use a livecd/dvd/usb rather than a virtual machine, and i would suggest trying a kde-based distro such as opensuse rather than some others.
ios is probably (as in i haven't investigated) is probably mac-based, hence unix-based via bsd.
i love both oss and use both daily.
long live open gl/cl and all open source software.
they all have their strengths and weakness.
