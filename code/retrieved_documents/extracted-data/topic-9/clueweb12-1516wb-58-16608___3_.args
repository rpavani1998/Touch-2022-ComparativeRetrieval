to write a gui for a script is much easier than writing the centralised, remote administration.of course, the community can and will have to improve on the (remote) administration, and a windoze domain is set up easier than a unix domain.so they tried to implement the others and offered those through the resource kits, because even they (m$) accept, that a useful sysadministration is only possible through scripts."over time, the gap in support costs between linux and windows will > contract."one of the troubles m$ had and conceded to have with nt was, that certain functions could be accessed only through the gui."we believe these higher costs are...related to the relative > immaturity of the management tools available today for linux > systems," idc said.administrators, too, will become more adept.administrators, too, will become more adept. >i've seen webmin in action, and intend on actively playing with it > soon.with all respect to a fellow citizen, this gui-thinggie is wrong from the start.maybe the linux zealots (well, freebsd, and other unixes as well) > shouldn't stick with the cli based admin/management tools, and get > some really good gui thing running for the windows-converted admins.eh, by the way: even for the first release of w2k implementation of *all* system functions on the command line was a *must* for the developers.just recently slashdot had a contribution of m$ re-inventing the command line, including inventing tab-completion, history, grep, yada yada yada... .if yes, then the writers are not very competent.
