making a mistake in windows usually gives you an error message, however making a mistake on linux can lead to the dreaded kernel panic or worse.to improve your overall experience of linux i advocate trying out all the different types of desktop, there are a fair few to choose from, some offering more speed than others, others being maybe a bit slower but more functional in terms of graphics and point and click.windows has something akin to 200 or so commands that you can learn and pass to the dos command prompt whereas linux has so many commands and functions you could spend your lifetime reading and still find yourself not having covered every subject.it is based on unix, very stable, very secure.there are software hacks you can do to run those system on not native hardware but why bother when linux presents a far easier solution as it runs on both.linux also help you to enhance the look of your os graphically and openoffice doesn't allow you to miss ms office even for a little while.the biggest crutch against linux is it is not easy to get to grips with if your not used to using it, it's possible to bork or kill your own machine from installing the wrong package from an on-line repository or archive.this will probably improve with time, but currently linux works best with linux-programs and windows with windows-programs.the best thing anyone new to linux can do is start to familiarize themselves with the terminal, as that is where - as your experience grows you'll find you'll end up spending 99.5% of your time.licencing issues and office/microsoft updates are also contributing to this, making using microsoft, become painful and almost pointless for day to day stuff.i think linux will rule over all os in future cause its open source and continuously working to make better and better their distributions.. now they have"wine" which can run all windows software on linux so its near that people ll migrate towards linux, and save their money paying for windows with no security ....it also provides a better protection than the windows.linux used to be all shell driven, meaning it used to be all command line, x-windows or x11 only came along later.pc experience: >+_ operating system: windows 7 ultimate 64b tbh i have just also installed kubunto, a linux based os, this mainly because of the fact that google is developing a linux based os, and with the increasing popularity of linux, and the growing availability of applications, i can see in the near futur linux becoming a serious contender to windows, especially with the current cost of windows compared to linux.tbh i have just also installed kubunto, a linux based os, this mainly because of the fact that google is developing a linux based os, and with the increasing popularity of linux, and the growing availability of applications, i can see in the near futur linux becoming a serious contender to windows, especially with the current cost of windows compared to linux.
