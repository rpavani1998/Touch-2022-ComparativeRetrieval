for most users, a standard linux installation provides better security than the most advanced windows firewall.if you're using linux at home, you will need to know more about how your computer works than you did with windows.if you are using linux at work, it will be just as easy to use as windows was, with the added bonus that you don't have to call it support several times a week, or wait half a day to send e-mail every time your exchange server goes down.with linux on your home computer, you will be changing your own oil, brake shoes, and even replacing the whole engine, and it will be easy.by accepting the license agreement for windows xp, you are not only acknowledging the fact that microsoft owns the operating system, you are giving themde facto ownership of your computer.here are some of the highlights, in plain english: the eula gives microsoft the right to install 'security updates' at their convenience.it's easy to get a high security rating on a computer with no network connection.if at any time microsoft decides that your hardware has changed, you have installed 'untrustworthy' software, or the moon is the wrong shade of blue, they can shut down your installation of windows through your modem or network.if you have a dialup connection, this process will probably steal your bandwidth for several minutes each time you connect to the internet.if your hardware has changed too much, you will have to contact microsoft for permission to use your computer.in order for anything to invade your linux computer, it has to gainroot access.don't be too impressed when a linux user tells you he compiles his own applications; for the most part that means he types three commands, and the computer does the rest.yes, seventeen years after releasing windows, microsoft has acknowledged that "our products are not engineered for security" (ms executive), and launched trustworthy computing.here are some of the highlights, in plain english: you used to have the ability to install windows an unlimited number of times.if windows crashes (if?), you must contact microsoft for permission to re-install it.
