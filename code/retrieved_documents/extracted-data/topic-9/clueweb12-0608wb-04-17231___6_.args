you are all more than welcome to join us or ask specific questions about how to go about folding but please start a new thread to post your questions, this way nothing of importance will be lost and everyone here will help you out.i do know that my gentoo install was faster than anything else i've used before as it was a very stipped down kernel and since everything installed from source, it was all compiled just for my system.unfortunately, i don't want to run a 64-bit version of linux without going full 64-bit, which isn't quite possible yet.everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.maybe since windows 7 is less resource hungry than vista i'll have a better ppd average now.i'm trying to get it working but i can't get the necessary files installed (via install.bat) to get the core running and i checked over at the folding forum and it doesn't appear as though anyone over there is running w7 just yet, though they do have a placeholder for comments.maybe it's just because lately i've been doing a little bit more than i did with vista, but all of the wu that i'm getting seem to be taking about 6-8 hrs longer now than they did previously.hey, try smp in vmware and see if it works in w7, it would be interesting to know.freebsd is the only other thing i'd say compared to the responsiveness of the system.jeez, they just got their gpu2 beta cores going very nicely now after a hiccup last november.i'll be installing w7 shortly so we can then compare notes on folding.still learning logic can get you from a to b- board index ‹ technical chat ‹ distributed computing - change font size windows 7 smp client folding@home related discussion.if you just want to chat folding then the folding@home home thread will be great!top - imnuts - pro supreme - - posts: 7457 - joined: wed mar 24, 2004 5:19 am - location: boothwyn, pennsylvania - real name: mark - re: windows 7 smp client by imnuts on wed jan 21, 2009 4:53 pm windows 7 seems to run slower than vista for smp folding performance.
