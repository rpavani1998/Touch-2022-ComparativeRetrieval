linux is treated as more secure and stable, but it is not much supported by its users.in comparison of windows & linux, linux attempts to handle more number of processes whereas in the same time windows becomes unstable faster as more number of processes is run.stability of the windows servers such as windows 2000 & windows 2003 is much better compared to a different league of versions like 95, 98 & me.stability of desktop vs. server people, who are naïve to the “web hosting world”, should add to their knowledge that they can use either linux or windows to host their web pages though those pages were developed on a desktop.windows comes paid while linux is free linux is an open source as it is a joint effort of different volunteer programmers.while php has functionality over both platforms, microsoft programmers care little to use it on other os than windows itself.these programmers are hired and paid for their job by microsoft.many have impression of windows being buggy, insecure and unstable.microsoft like any other business seeks to make profit from its products.they are used to send the information to the server which the server stores for further processing.such original html pages can interpreted on any web server without considering the type of operating system.windows xp is quiet stable and apparent, mainly because it is designed according to windows 2000 which is a server.despite the monopoly of microsoft, due to some reasons it is treated as a bad boy.dynamic web pages like forum, shopping cart, etc are different from the static ones.on the other hand, windows too don’t have many fans but still operated but still contributes to larger section of hosting community.
