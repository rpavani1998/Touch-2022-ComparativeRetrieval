in addition, with access to all of the source-code for thelinux kernel and various open source applications that we use , we can optimize the entire operating system for use in kiosks or digital signs.we gain all of the strengths of linux, like built in security features and rock-solid reliability, without having to worry about its weaknesses, like the lack of certain software applications important for desktop use.since we don't have to worry about the perceived limitations of linux systems, our purpose-built approach to kiosk and digital signage software is gaining a lot of attention in the industry.i appreciate the gains in stability that windows has made over the years.but when you need a secure, reliability, remotely-managed operating system, "better" isn't good enough.at wirespring, we obviously believe in linux as an operating platform for kiosk and digital signage applications.in addition, statements like, "you can write a 'leaky' (eats memory until it crashes) on any operating system, linux or windows," aside from being in need of a good proof-read, are not 100% true, due to some very technical differences between the way windows and linux systems work.while there is no question that windows, with it's95%+ market share in the desktop arena dictates what is good and easy and expected and status-quo for desktop users, the picture is muchmore fuzzy when it comes to server-based, embedded and single-purpose applications, asany number of articles will purport to tell you.they make some good points about computer software in general, but in the end i'm left with the impression that they're trying to defend why windows isstill a good choice for signage applications.i'm still a windows desktop user, and the fewer of windows errors that i see, the better.while everybody agrees that running a free copy of linux on a $2,000,000ibm zseries mainframe is more expensive than running a $500 copy of windows on a $1,500 pc fromdell, no study, research publication or "news" site can tell you whether windows or linux is right for your project.of course, since firecast doesn't have to lug around all of the desktop-oriented baggage that a windows system does, we have a lot less testing to do.hardware, software and expert advice for digital signage and kiosks skip to main content home products solutions blog support company news contact customer login latest articles full article list the digital signage insider industry and news and best practices for digital signage, m2m and kiosk projects.all content besides the actual article text, e.g. surrounding branding and informational content, is copyright Â© 2000-2012 wirespring technologies, inc.however, scala does note that, "the trick is to understand and test," which i do wholeheartedly agree with.
