pm i don't know of any that are running windows.
with linux though, the gui is pretty different and you're able to do more things with commands, much like the ms dos days.
only scenarios where linux isn't a massive pain in the ass to use is as a set-and-forget standalone server that won't network with windows boxes.

apple is really helping linux in the games area because of opengl/cl.
byte queue limits are introduced to help solve the problem and enables developers to set a configurable limit of packet data.
according to the published changelog, version 3.3 improves the handling of intel's rc6 power saving mode, which enables linux to reliably work with sandy bridge graphics units.

a lot a things work differently from windows, so it might take some time to get used to.

while the programs that run on top of linux can be hacked or damaged, there is little to no fear of your kernal being compromised (unless you have an easy password to crack), so it is great for things where you are not sure what you are getting yourself into.
it has pro level networking options and makes great low-overhead servers.
i can't take linux serious until i open the terminal...
but now they have largely fixed that in most distros it does still win on 3 key fronts: 1) most distros are free, which is important when you have a lot of computers that you would have to purchase windows for.
while i believe the difference between linux and windows for daily casual computing (word processing youtubing etc) is nonexistent.
the developers have also invested some effort to "fight bufferbloat", which is a scenario of latency and throughput issues that are caused by excessive buffering.
linux affords a degree of freedom which makes it difficult to go back to anything else.

ms thought they killed off apple for other reason but that has failed.
no, linux is not unix-based.
but for that matter mac is not unix based but macosx is.

makes life waaay easier (yes, easier, as in takes less time, more efficient) than windows coding in my experience.
the nouveau driver package for nvidia nva3 (and up) gpus now supports audio output via hdmi.
6:21 am hide - 1 + anyway, i'd like to see kernel 3.4 asap, it's supposed to fix power issues with android x86; the damn thing only gives me 30-90 min of battery life on my netbook (4-5 hours on windows/ubuntu 11.04).
also noteworthy is the return of android subsystem and feature code.
the kernel 3.3 now also includes a nvme driver, which acts as an interface for ssds via pci or pcie.
amd evergreen gpus now also support audio output via hdmi.
then i can't take windows seriously.

this is a good article, i didn't realize that the kernel just can out, i though it was still in the rc stages.
it's worthless for video games though.
years ago when linux was just starting, win 95/98 days you could buy linux based games in retail shops along side ms software, i remember buying some.
a bunch of games are listed for wine too.
the kernel 3.3 now also includes a nvme driver, which acts as an interface for ssds via pci or pcie.
included are new features for the network stack, graphics drivers, android code, storage support as well as basic architecture changes that enables arm systems to address more than 3.8 tb of memory.
it isn't better than windows for a home user.
it also use to be clunkey and hard to use for every-day stuff...
the only major difference between linux and windows for casual use is that m$ doesn't have a linux version of office, you don't have ie, and there can be difficulties on linux because of software patents on audio or video codecs (or the likes of css for dvds).

pm hide - 8 + i just updated my lubuntu kernel and my intel i3 vostro laptop appears to be using about 20 percent less power compared to the 3.1 kernel i previously had (according to "powertop").
according to the published changelog, version 3.3 improves the handling of intel's rc6 power saving mode, which enables linux to reliably work with sandy bridge graphics units.
answer no to both of those and you might be able to get by on a mac or with linux on your pc.
everything you run on it has to be built for android libraries/runtime.
most are running linux too.
it's good for servers but i can't see why anyone would use it as a daily operating system.
i have a rather high-end machine and everything is supported (kind of).
it use to have a very clean ui, which has now been cluttered in most versions.
most of them are also running linux.
it uses the linux kernel, making it linux-based.
ios is probably (as in i haven't investigated) is probably mac-based, hence unix-based via bsd.

byte queue limits are introduced to help solve the problem and enables developers to set a configurable limit of packet data.
the kernel seems to be more stable on my system than the 3,1 kernel so far.
steam now has mac too, no dx there either.
it isn't better than windows... at all.
it use to be great for tinkering with to get your computer to do things it otherwise would not be able to do... but now it is so easy to develop on windows that there is little point.
or put it in a virtual box which is what i do when i need to run some cern stuff that's unix based.
windows is better for games, but only because it is the only os that the majority of pc games can be played on.
by default all good ratings poor ratings filiprino 03/20/2012 12:27 pm hide - 1 + maybe that rc6 power saving mode has something to do with the problems i have with my linux kernel booting.
but linux is free, has easy access to lots of free software, no-one can be bothered to write viruses for it (not that they would have an easy time anyway), and can have several advantages in specific situations.
if you don't care about gaming and are some what proficient with a computer, linux can be a very powerful os.
