i can see why the average consumer just won't touch it.
the cpu was built different and therefore better ie faster than a pc with the same e8200.
but driver issues, game and application compatibility is holding it back.
every camera is supported i connected till this day (sony, fuji, canon, nikon, ... )
most of webcamera drivers are already installed in the 2.6 kernels, get a linux based chat protocoll and you get webcam.
i've tried windows, ubuntu, macosx(hackintosh) and have 4 os on my pc at one time.
the "security" thing gave me a laugh, and they also claimed it wasn't clear whether linux updated critical vulnerabilities quickly or not, or that it was harder to install programs and updates.
linux has much better security and low over head.
xp still won't find my brother wireless laser printer.
and i really thought the gui was a little better cause its pretty much stolen and modded from osx anyway.
i have a hard time believing that even the marketing peeps at ms have never heard of a package manager, so that much is just straight up bullshit.
it seems that microsoft is trying to fight off linux machines that are sold through best buy, which if any, are netbooks only.
of course trying to use that running program is gonna be another story.
many companies across many industries partake in some form of evangelism (though some would call it propaganda) for its products.
well that and games keep me glued to windows more than linux.
also i lack knowledge of the other features but i would assume that limited on all that stuff is true.
we can't imagine that there will be many customers who will wander into best buy without a clue of which operating system he or she should go with – the new and shiny windows 7 or the mysterious, counter-culture linux.
they aren't saying not supported for multimedia, just limited.
install with a single click, it's on ubuntu's multiverse, or get ubuntu tweak, and a single click will install it.
moving on to desktops cause i was like i cant build my own pc he was saying that an e8200 in the imac was better than an e8200 in a windows machine.
every other company does this type of marketing on a daily basis, i don't see how it becomes news when microsoft does it.
anything portable i connected, it worked perfect, even my cell phone carrier's usb modem that needed drivers for windows.
when i go to a popular download site such as download.com and search for software, the majority of the results are windows based.
many companies across many industries partake in some form of evangelism (though some would call it propaganda) for its products.
think again, linux is not a newbie o/s and most people aren't going to put the effort in all the training involved in setting up linux.
there is some programs that you can play lots of windows games with linux and btw microsoft used before linux for their own server because they don't even thrust their own win server security.
i don't think wine is part of linux.
windows almost always requires a codec pack, and without 3rd-party software, it's not easy to tell which codecs are installed and which are not.
don't get me wrong, i still use it for my home nas, and i dual boot it on my desktop.
at work, it's my job to tweak things, make it work, utilize the stability of linux for uptime etc.
i still think windows is a better os for personal use and single user mode.
i'll probably get windows 7 and dual-boot for my next desktop build.
ubuntu was happy to install it on both my desktop and laptop without complaint.
linux really does suck.
hence why it generally makes little sense to go out and buy a mac and rely entirely on mac osx (which is a modified beos, a type of unix).
wine is not linux support.
it seems that microsoft is trying to fight off linux machines that are sold through best buy, which if any, are netbooks only.
i agree with one commenter that manufacturers are very slow or simply not updating drivers for their older devices.
it's a good thing it doesn't work on linux because it's a load of crapware anyway and there are much better gpl programs.
i think this artikle is a propaganda, m$ paind tom$hardware to advertise m$ what a joke this artikle is lol don't believe it at all.
i told him if i went online i could get the dell studio 14z better spected with a higher resolution what i think is really important for under a grand.
i guess how many printer drivers are natively in windows.
as for authorised support, that's a load of rubbish.
video chat is also supported well on linux through skype and pidgin.
we can't imagine that there will be many customers who will wander into best buy without a clue of which operating system he or she should go with – the new and shiny windows 7 or the mysterious, counter-culture linux.
for everything you need to search the net... even for video drivers.
linux does not have a lack of support for games, the games have a lack of support for linux.
just so many things wrong with that training, ack, bull shit meter exploding (must be an iphone app).
and fiy linux does cost quite a bit to deploy on the cooperate scale yet people still do it due to the benefit.[/citation] please explain to the class why its better to use it for everyday use.
get all these open source freeware idiots off thier ass's and standardise thier software.
for my desktop, my only real excuse is gaming.
as for the windows live essentials bit, i can't imagine actually worrying about that when most default installs of linux have much better alternatives.
shadow703793 09/09/2009 2:10 am there is probably more software for linux than windows if you count the small projects.
there are a lot of forums where you can get help, a lot better than microsoft help for free.
you guys writing this article think that most windows/mac osx users would be able to install all the hardware and software they want?
it's hardly user friendly, looks crap and slower than a mac osx.
i totaly agree if linux wasnt free it would have likely been forgotten.
so your the one who is wrong and keeps clutching on to his free copy of ubuntu that you had to spend 5.99 to get in the mail linux is only for everyday use for hackers and the hardcore nerds which is why viruses are not popular on linux.
windows runs just about every game natively without emulation and linux doesn't.
i'd give microsoft the benefit on gaming, but media playback is a wash, especially with ms incorporating new drm in its operating systems starting with vista.
where so i can take that loldeltatux 09/09/2009 1:19 am microsoft fuds about linux again, quite typical.
i can't build and customize my rig if i go mac, and that's the only other platform adobe supports.
don't need to search the net for it.
basically this kind of thing highlights the old adage "buyer beware".randomizer 09/09/2009 5:09 am more people who think linux = ubuntu.randomizer 09/09/2009 5:11 am i love linux for work, it's ultra fast and very flexible in the right hands.
at least m$ isn't going on here claiming that win7 is a better solution than linux for use as a server o/s
linux can support things from one distro and not support things from another.
09/09/2009 2:08 am this shows how much of a threat linux is to windows.
it may be included in some distributions but it afaik is not built into the kernel.
this has more to do with the manufacturer for not providing good drivers or open sourcing the ones they have but it still sucks to deal with.
linux is also very good, but it's free (the ones i used) which means a lot of the software is very unstable.
i've never used a mac osx in my life, but after 1 week, i totally fall in love with it.
for gaming, entertainment, day to day stuff windows is better, has more apps, more options, and usually not a big deal finding drivers or configuring some weird stuff.
though if my current ubuntut/xp laptop is any indication even windows 7 might not get much love.

i think this artikle is a propaganda, m$ paind tom$hardware to advertise m$ this is mainly just a marketing campaign, except it's not targeted at customers but at middle-men like best buy employees.
some of the best evangelism starts at the retail level, where employees can 'inform' the buying consumer while trying to sell a life-saving in-store warranty policy.
why even attempt to make a game for a platform that has 1 in probly 10,000 people using it.
one of the slides that microsoft used (above) is fairly misleading, as world of warcraft is supported in linux through wine.
in the end, the trouble is far more than what it's worth.
anyway i don't think anything microsoft over linux has done can top apples umm i am the best thing in world and will say anything to convice you of that tactic.
if so, use microsoft, not linux based os.
one of the slides that microsoft used (above) is fairly misleading, as world of warcraft is supported in linux through wine.
and do something to get support other then "we are the tree hugging hippy retards that make better things for the consumer because we arent greedy corperate money mongering capitalists."
other than gaming, the only thing keeping me on windows is adobe creative suite.
as a web developer i'm pretty tied to adobe creative suite more than is good for me.
encountered materials from microsoft that push certain superiorities that windows 7 possess over linux.
a best buy employee, who happens to also be an overclock.net forum poster, recently partook in a microsoft expertzone training exercise (with the incentive to be able to buy windows 7 for $10)
not really news anymore.
does anyone here use windows live essentials?rooket 09/09/2009 1:35 am screen shot looks true enough to me.
hardware support for windows is by far better than linux.

of course windows is better.
i know you can google for linux software.
as for hardware, i've had more hardware troubles with windows than with linux.
linux isn't for games, but if your a game fan, then wine, cedega, crossover will do the trick for most games (wow works with cedega very good) authorized support for what ?
they use all kinds of os's no ones even heard of let alone suitable for the end user.
so while nothing is completely untrue it's not completely honest either and taking it as a global truth could be very misleading.
sure given enough time, i can tweak a majority of my games to work - but that's it, time.
my work desktop is as customizable as any, shinier and prettier than win7 with tons of usability and all my options are always available to me.
with ubuntu a single click, and jockey will install it without an extra click or whatever.
encountered materials from microsoft that push certain superiorities that windows 7 possess over linux.
for usability, the popular os wins (unfortunately), and i run vista at home for my laptop and desktop.
but hell they cant even get any good options in that api anymore.
adding repositories could be more straightforward, but it's by no means "hard."
share: well it's true, dunno what microsoft said, but i definably believe myself that windows is better than linux (unless you're doing something linux worthy like a web server or some cluster or anything).
i could go on with this guy.
somewhere allong the way he went on to say that the cpu on windows ran at 20%-40% at idle and on osx it ran at 0%.
then there is office where microsoft office is used by 99% of the work and education world and with openoffice being free its not 100% reliable when it comes with compatibility.
i've tried to wine it, but too many small annoyances really.
he also tried to convince me that having 2 gb of ddr3 would beat 4gb of ddr2 hands down.
yes you can just run so many bloated windows applications on that netbook.
the only way they will get the support is to push for it not expect people to give a damn about them cuz they are "open source" or "better".
the only reason linux is still afloat is because it is free.knight9413
in ubuntu at least (probably one of the more media-friendly distros) just add medibuntu repositories, and you're good to go.
everyday you get roadblocks from webpages that use windows media player for links to videos, for internet when you have to install plugins you have to run complex scripts which can take god knows how long vs windows where it is just one install package.
