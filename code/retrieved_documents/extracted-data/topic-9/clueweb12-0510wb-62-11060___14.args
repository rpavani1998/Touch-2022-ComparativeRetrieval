i've always had an excellent experience with the software.
i was not about to expose the writers to an enormous amount of frustration and wasted time.
another tell-tale sign that the days of windows as we know it are drawing to a close are the increasing number of stories aboutmidori: microsoft is incubating a componentized non-windows operating system known as midori, which is being architected from the ground up to tackle challenges that redmond has determined cannot be met by simply evolving its existing technology.
no, it's the fact that however microsoft tries to spin the numbers, vista is simply not catching on.
this is manifest most clearly in schools, where teaching computing really means teaching children how to use windows and office.
when i was teaching engineering all the postgrad students used latex for their theses. one guy decided word was the way forward.
once people realise they have a choice, then windows' stranglehold on the desktop market will be fatally loosened.
i tried word from time to time up until ooo came out and it still sucked.
b) certain services where the need is not consistent and the customer pays by the dip.
but that does not mean that windows will maintain its dominance there, simply that the future is more complex than the monoculture we have seen and suffered for nearly two decades.
i own some windows clients and am rather adept at using them.
thesplashtop technology uses gnu/linux as a kind of pre-operating system that lets users boot up very quickly to gain internet access and perform key tasks such as checking email or moving around the web.
the traditional desktop experience is being further redefined through the move to cloud computing solutions, which are frequently browser-based, and the appearance of gnu/linux-based ultraportables, which also draw on net-based solutions for much of their convenience.
the only service of any significance is fios and its not sufficiently deployed nationally.
i felt like telling him to look outside the box he's put himself in.
"can we not only emulate, but can we blow right past apple?" quite correctly, shuttleworth sees apple as the one to beat these days.
what this means is that users of these systems, even when rigorously windows-based, will be experiencing the power and speed of gnu/linux, albeit unwittingly, when they use this mode.
although the market share of gnu/linux there is finally lifting – figuresrange from 3% to 11%, according to the sector – it seems unlikely that gnu/linux will ever take over the desktop from windows.
there are some very cool looking alternative oses being designed, and i certainly wouldn't want to steer anyone away from them into linux for some weird reason.
i knew ooo would get better and ms word would only get more bloated and more clunky.
i didn't grow up entirely inside the windows bubble.
i've been using ooo on windohs and linux for the last 6+ years to process, edit, create all sorts of ms docs and spreadsheets for a client that is windohs only.
as something of an obsessive magpie, i've tended to keep most of it, “for reference”.
all those 'life coaches' suddenly have an increase of clientele from all those windohs people with mcse certs.
this is not so much things like the recentsecurity hole in vista's memory protection, which may ormay not be a big deal – although if bruce schneiersees it as a real problem, then i think microsoft's probably in trouble.
i don't think it unreasonable over a 5-10 period to see linux acceptance at the 25% mark as a portion of market share.
in the end it cost him a huge amount of time, frustration and effort splitting up the document into parts that word would handle.
it’s a fully integrated technology that will appear later this year on the dell 4200 and 4300 latitude series notebooks, and is powered by a linux os, sort of as a secondary operating system.
sd times has viewed internal microsoft documents that outline midori’s proposed design, which is internet-centric and predicated on the prevalence of connected systems.
by the way what personifies "linux people" from users in general? furthermore, many of us involved in what you call business already use linux and bsd the way the article describes as a heterogeneous environment, and the microsoft slice of the mix is declining.
free software has nothing to fear from a heterogeneous environment – indeed, mixing technologies almost forces open standards upon manufacturers if they want to provide full interoperability.
i actually don't care whether the developer looks like a hippy or dressed in a tux(edo), or what mentality he or she has, or as long as the code is effective and secure.
but besides that not more than a confirmation that some folks get stuck in the past, or even worse an imaginary illusion of a past.

moreover, as many have pointed out, the low number of gnu/linux viruses is only in part down to the latter's superior design.
tech is very democratic price wise.
moreover, if the idea proves popular, it's not hard to imagine most pc manufacturers following suit in order to match dell's move, ensuring that many more people experience the fact that it is possible to use a pc without using windows.
thesplashtop technology uses gnu/linux as a kind of pre-operating system that lets users boot up very quickly to gain internet access and perform key tasks such as checking email or moving around the web.
even if you can keep it or windohs running.

oss on linux is fine.
even if they don't know it's gnu/linux, they will certainly be aware that it is not windows.
i've noticed a paradigm out there and people are happy to live within the little bubble.
i think linux has made for itself the biggest name in oss, but linux itself isn't really the issue.
this is manifest most clearly in schools, where teaching computing really means teaching children how to use windows and office.
linux still gains regardless.
on works by bypassing the windows operating system so that you get immediate access to things like your calendar, email, internet, and contacts.
matter is that i'm depressed about linux for its unhappy and ill looking graphical interface especially like gnome, new kde.
this is not so much things like the recentsecurity hole in vista's memory protection, which may ormay not be a big deal – although if bruce schneiersees it as a real problem, then i think microsoft's probably in trouble.
the president actually said to me "well, i can't change the entire paradigm".
the company can try all themarketing tricks it likes, but customers are voting with their wallets byopting for the “downgrade” to xp: an official at pc maker hewlett-packard said the majority of the company's business customers are downgrading new computers from windows vista to windows xp -- raising questions about microsoft's vista sales figures.
so when a product manager came to us with a doc they had started in word, rather than go through a messy convoluted conversion and since prod managers didn't really understand how to do much formatting to begin with, i finished it off.
they're intimidated by technology in general, and they believe windows makes things easy enough for them to cope.

one of the best proofs that free software is superior in all senses to proprietary software is having the maturity to recognise that the world of personal computing today is far more complicated, and far richer, than bill gates's original, monopolistic vision of “a (microsoft-based) computer on every desktop”.
i've use openoffice as a rescue in many such situations.
but for some reason, ms thinks it knows better and really began to screw with the ui not to mention bloating the daylights out of the software.
it’s a fully integrated technology that will appear later this year on the dell 4200 and 4300 latitude series notebooks, and is powered by a linux os, sort of as a secondary operating system.

c) company has capital constraints on it acquisitions that can be differed as a expense stream using a similar service online.
i grew up around it, with technology and cut my teeth on so many different things, windows was one tool in the toolbox.
what's makes this little spring-cleaning exercise particularly apt as well as cathartic is that all of us - and not just me - may finally be witnessing the end of the windows era.
broadband is not where it should be at a bandwidth/pricepoint to make the cloud price competive for a replacement of the os.
can anyone tell how can we make linux more elegant, more friendly in both textual and graphical interface..
even if they don't know it's gnu/linux, they will certainly be aware that it is not windows.
if gnu/linux became as dominant on the desktop as windows, there would be a greater incentive to break that security – and a bigger knock-on effect when it was broken.
this is 1.0 beta not 2.4.1 version i really appreciate an effort but result is not there do not like ms same as you do but buddy they have something that works well with minumum effort to learn product you can make any claim you want.
when he got about 150 pages done, word corrupted his document.
it's fine for business letters, but if you have to create a larger doc, it's just no good.
some things work well in windows, and others are a nightmare, hence it's more pragmatic to be open to alternatives.
again word corrupted it.
the writers in my department all used pagemaker or framemaker.
especially the note that the desktop space is ms's to lose which seems to be the case.
i'm also disappointed with the deterioration of the ui in word.
as a computer journalist for the last 25 years, i've received a lot of review copies of software.
the cloud will continue to play a role but it will be limited to certain situations - a) offsite storage where the costs are less than say a physical service like iron mountain.
moreover, if the idea proves popular, it's not hard to imagine most pc manufacturers following suit in order to match dell's move, ensuring that many more people experience the fact that it is possible to use a pc without using windows.
first, it was announced thatasus motherboards would be offering the feature, and thenasus notebooks.
john knight ...for the kind words - much appreciated.

far better to promote heterogeneity, which is good for the software ecosystem, and thus good for *all* users.
the price i pay at frys for a hard drive off the shelf is not that much different from what amazon pays for those drives by the box load.
no, it's the fact that however microsoft tries to spin the numbers, vista is simply not catching on.

but that does not mean that windows will maintain its dominance there, simply that the future is more complex than the monoculture we have seen and suffered for nearly two decades.
i would not be surprised to see that usage change till we see massive changes in price structures of data transport.
first, it was announced thatasus motherboards would be offering the feature, and thenasus notebooks.
until yesterday, that is, when i finally threw out all those copies of os/2, lotus smartsuite, and my entire collection of microsoft software.
a couple of notes concerning your choice of word-processor: many writers would even argue that a word-processor is a poor choice, and that document processor like latex is far better suited for the task.
and we're all saving lots of money and avoiding a great deal of irritation because of better stability and security.
i find myself just nodding my head in agreement, as if you're putting into words many ideas a lot of us already know for fact.
for example when citing people, you can correct the wording if you place the fixes into square brackets.
keep dreaming boys linux will never move beyond linux type ppl unless linus exercises some power among developers - hippie mentality does not play with businesses and general population linux software programs are too buggy, not much tested before releasing final versions and program version is just a joke - developer writes 2 line code that does not work at all and calls it version 1.1 my experience - tried to substitute ms word with open office (i write books) - does not work - oowriter is a joke for any serious job linus needs to do some spring cleaning among developers (here i think mostly abt program version number) and allow some commercial opportunity otherwise there will be no significant move in linux market share - it is simply not good enough for general population and businesses i'm talking here about linux applications not kernel you write books omg that must be where you get them mad punctuation skillz im so impressed wth how claerly you express you're self wwwpirate u must b rich linus needs to do some spring cleaning among developers (here i think mostly abt program version number) and allow some commercial opportunity otherwise there will be no significant move in linux market share - it is simply not good enough for general population and businesses i'm talking here about linux applications not kernel

i always like to read your writings.
the more diversity in this environment that is picked up by the mainstream, the better.
the traditional desktop experience is being further redefined through the move to cloud computing solutions, which are frequently browser-based, and the appearance of gnu/linux-based ultraportables, which also draw on net-based solutions for much of their convenience.
but i look forward to the day that the idea which takes majority is the best technical solution from the opinions of software developers and engineers, not marketing based on what the masses will find "easy" because of their comfort level with technology.
he went back to the last good backup and tried re-entering his day's work.
i was the only one (i being the manager of the group) that worked with it.
run the numbers and you see 3-4 months of s3 for storage and you have paid for the cost of the drive onsite.
midori is designed to run directly on native hardware (x86, x64 and arm), be hosted on the windows hyper-v hypervisor, or even be hosted by a windows process.
i'm glad you're able to work with it, but from my experience as a manager of a group of technical writers for 12+ years, ms word does not cut it.
sd times has viewed internal microsoft documents that outline midori’s proposed design, which is internet-centric and predicated on the prevalence of connected systems.
anyway, it's still a good idea to have openoffice included in the software mix, because at times you actually come across microsoft office produced documents that can't be opened by current version of microsoft office (some updates have even broken fairly newly made documents).

all of my work is an improvement on theirs since i'm more familiar with formating and layout.
as something of an obsessive magpie, i've tended to keep most of it, “for reference”.
surf the web safely, immune from the malware that targets windows.
i decided i preferred linux and it's corresponding tools because they were just better.
in fact, when i left my last job (an ms gold partner) part of it was due to the fact that i consider myself a "linux guy".

the only proprietary software that i still use (occasionally) is acrobat pro, bbedit, and bryce for my 3d stuff.
i'm glad you like the telepathic element.

ms's software is the weak product.

even as a fellow lj author, i have to admit that i'm not necessarily a linux advocate, but an open source one.
