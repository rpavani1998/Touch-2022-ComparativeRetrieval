get linux on cd or dvd select a linux distribution (a.k.a. distro) and either download it and burn it to disk or buy it and have it delivered.
you do this to create what  is called a “dual boot” (linux and windows) system.
if a hard disk has an extended  partition, then it has at least one logical partition in that partition.
these include the linux software programs and desktop(s) you want installed,  networking settings, and disk partition sizes.
another reason for setting up a multi boot system can be that one wants to investigate or test a new operating system without switching completely.
the b-tree file system (abbreviated to acronym btrfs) has not matured far enough to be used as a default file system on linux machines.
you log in with a user  name and password to work on a linux system.
this allows you to actually work with linux to run programs and learn linux commands.
also, as a linux system administrator, you will also need to manage  (create, delete, and modify) partitions on existing linux systems (after the os  has been installed).
document your linux installation settings during the linux installation, you need to specify some system settings.
with gnu/linux, you are in general connect as a user to restricted access, and you pass as a root (i.e. administrator under windows) when you must change important parameters of the system or regulate the hardware configuration or add or remove a program.

you can easily save your windows directory as a tar archive and many viruses will not have any effect as explained below: another protection is given by the snapshot running mode which insures that data in the c: virtual drive cannot be changed win4lin limitations and peculiarities.
if you need more than four hard disk partitions, you need to create at  least one extended partition and then create one or more logical partitions in  the extended partition.
with windows, you are accustomed to only one partition on your hard disk.
this time this partition is for /, which is the main file system.
this is often accomplished by using a boot loader that can boot more than one operating system, such as ntldr, lilo, or grub.
the first partition is a boot partition, which is mounted at the /boot.
that thus gives 1 partition root “/”, 2 partition “/home”.
you may be able to “break” these rules with other hard disk partitioning utilities.
some good advantages that i found in win4lin are the following: recently i had to install linux on a new machine and i decided to install both a new opensuse 11.0 distribution and the new version ofwin4linpro that now supports windows 2000 and xp (according to the company vista should also be supported in future).

i found that the wine or codeweavers crossover supported most common microsoft windows applications, but some other ones would not work.
after having to seek, to study, read the opinions of users, with the wire  of time, on many distributions, two points arise: the first: gnu/linux bureau is a question of taste, the second: not a distribution does not join together the whole of the best  options.
always create at least one “regular” (non- root) user and  give this user a password.
even though we are installing on a btrfs file system, make the boot partition as a ext4 file system.
i had some problems with the original installation to use a com device for a dial up connection.
when the installation is complete, you will find two image files with the .img suffix which are used by windows as the c: drive (used to store windows programs and data) and the d: drive (used to store user settings).
it is often difficult to use only linux, because one normally has to work in windows based lans, interact with other windows or linux users or just because one is too lazy to learn new applications instead of those normally used in a windows environment.
then, make sure the btrfs journaling file system option is chosen for this partition.
gnu/linux functions  differently.

gnu/linux functions differently.
another solution to  these problems is to use virtual machine software to emulate another computer  from within the operating system of choice.)
when you’re doing linux disk partitioning (during or after installing linux) you will likely run into situations where you can’t create partitions – and can’t do other tasks that you’d like to do with partitions!
however, for security reasons, you should never log in to a linux desktop as the root user.
if a hard disk has an extended partition, then it has at least one logical partition in that partition.
(however hardware costs are  counterbalanced by system management costs, and the costs of the unavailability  of the software that cannot be run at any given moment.
1- to choose its distribution: there is much opinion on the gnu/linux distribution with which you will  have to start, and the majority are not relevant.
no comments linux training – installing linux on a windows system
the community the forums are sources of support as well as the site of your distribution if you chose a distribution commercial.
click on the “install linux mint” icon on the desktop.
the original product required to copy files from your windows 95, 98 or me cd to disk and eventually install windows.
with windows, you are in general either an administrator, or a user with the rights of administrator.
“setting up” linux hard disk partitions you can “set up” and configure your linux partitions while using the installation routine of most linux distributions – and also by using the linux fdisk and parted commands – and some other partitioning commands.
if the list checks out, click on install now.
the personal windows environment is normally created by win4linpro in the home directory of the user who performs the installation.
it contains the operating system, the applications, the data, and a great space for your file of windows exchange (the software uses space on the hard disk when the read-write memory is not enough any more).
all windows installations will be easily found by linux, but windows boot managers do not find linux installations (nor does windows deal natively with linuxfile systems).
some systems are set up to automatically boot from a cd / dvd if  there’s one in the drive, and some need to have a system setting made.
to avoid loosing useful data, i performed following activities: making the above copies in the win4linpro environment is relatively easy, because win4linpro can access mnt directly.
always create at least one “regular” (non- root) user and give this user a password.
the main steps are as following: when you are sure that everything works correctly, you can remove the /home.old directory.
no comments beginners under gnu – linux?
conclusions i believe that the approach described above allows an optimal use of both linux and windows resources.
some systems are set up to automatically boot from a cd / dvd if there’s one in the drive, and some need to have a system setting made.
vmware looked interesting, but finally i decided to buywin4lin (originally developed by netraverse to support only windows 95, 98 or me, even if it allowed to install and use many more recent applications such as office 2000 or other ones developed for xp without a glitch.

the last partition is for the swap partition, which provides disk space that the system will use as virtual memory.
i normally used my laptop pc during the day in a company that had a windows based lan and therefore i normally had to boot in windows during the day whereas i would boot into either windows or linux at home.
you must decide if you want to change the default values.
i installed various applications such as microsoft office, acrobat reader, eudora, hotmetal pro and a new version of internet explorer without any problem.
“, because it is there that you will store images, films, and other large files.
by emma rosenberg in this tutorial, the reader will learn how to install the linux mint 12 kde on a btrfs filesystem.
make sure the target disk has been initialized before you create the partitions.
but if you  wish to preserve your data and the preferences of the applications which you  use, it is to better do two other partitions for the operating system, the  other for your data and your adjustments.
linux extended partitions a linux hard disk must have at least one primary partition before it can  have an exteneded partition.
ubuntu 2- is linux free?
to be able to use the disk space in an extended partition, it must have at least one logical partition (within the extended partition).
in terms of business strategy, windows does not facilitate or support multi-boot systems, other than allowing for partition-specific installations, and no choice ofboot loader is offered.
by default win4linpro automatically configures shared folders so that windows can access linux files and linux can access windows files.
essayer linux is not in fact so hard and a thing is sure in any case: more you  are frustrated with windows and its problems, more the transition to gnu/linux  will be easy.

the second partition is the root partition, which is mounted at /.
since i had an rpm based linux distribution (opensuse 11.0), i downloaded the rpm package.
this isn’t just free disk space, as seen from within windows.
by getting it,  installing it, and running it, you can get tons of experience working with it.
regardless, the stable version will likely have an identical installation process as the current release candidate, so it should not affect the validity of this article.
multi booting is useful in many situations, such as those where several  pieces of software require different operating systems and cannot be run on a  single system.
3- the partitions: with windows, you are accustomed to only one partition on your hard disk.
multi booting can also aid software developers where multiple operating  systems are required for development or testing purposes.

instead of choosing primary, choose logical.
this is  empty disk space that isn’t seen from within windows.
there are several linux hard disk partition “types”, such as  primary, extended and logical – and there are also strict  “rules” about using these linux partition types.
there will now be a free space option on your menu.
make sure it is a primary partition out of the two options.
if you don’t need it, fine.
5- to give up with the first problems: gnu/linux is not windows thus you enter a new world with new rules.
another reason for setting up a multi boot system can  be that one wants to investigate or test a new operating system without  switching completely.
once i was satisfied that all important data existed in the win4linpro environment, i decided to reformat the windows partition and copy my linux /home
when you’re doing linux disk partitioning (during or after installing  linux) you will likely run into situations where you can’t create  partitions – and can’t do other tasks that you’d like to do  with partitions!
linux primary partitions the disk partitioning utility in a linux installation routine and the fdisk command (and other disk partitioning commands) can create a maximum of four primary partitions per hard disk drive.
to  learn has to evolve/move in this new world will take time, it is normal.
if you need more than four hard disk partitions, you need to create at least one extended partition and then create one or more logical partitions in the extended partition.
