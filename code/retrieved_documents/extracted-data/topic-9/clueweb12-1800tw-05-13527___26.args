and they will use specific linux paths to headers, although linux also has softlinks to more standard paths in the unix world.
nevertheless, as i have already said to jed in the previous blog-comments: the problem with the posix api is that it is not built with security attributes in mind.
and yes, i just downloaded the crysis 2 updates and played a bit.
your university failed you by introducing you to silberschatz instead of tanenbaum (far superior) or stallings.
and by the way, we don’t use linux because we hate windows or we love unix.
but as you yourself already admit: you weren’t very respectful yourself.
in fact, i am never interested in ‘which is better’, my angle is, and has always been, about finding facts.
just because i mention this one book doesn’t mean i haven’t read any others.
we are going to stick with it, contribute to it and make it more better and more efficient.

he is locked into the linux mindset (“everything is a file”, “acls only exist in the filesystem” etc), and has little or no grasp of how windows works (newsflash: windows is not based on *nix.
we love linux because we love it, because it provides the most efficient free and open source alternative(according to me by the way), because we love the community it provides, because everyday it grows more than any other os in the world.

blogs tend to be opinion pieces, opinions are not always constructive.

as a sane, reasonable it professional i am aware of the weaknesses of all of my tools and i spend my time improving things rather than arguing which is better.
as you can see, i have been friendly to the other posters, extending them the same courtesy they have given me (much like with jed, really).
i’m a very experienced developer and project manager.
it does look really pretty.
so even though you may have acl support in the filesystem, and ‘everything is a file’, you still lack some control there.
i think there is some irony in that: a lot of people use windows simply because it is the most obvious option, not because they really thought about what kind of os suits their needs best.
we are going to stick with it, contribute to it and make it more better and more efficient.
in this case, however, i try to be constructive by confronting people with their behaviour, in the idle hope that they may realize what they are doing, and subsequently change their ways.

the people who hate microsoft/windows use linux simply because it is the most obvious option, not because they really thought about what kind of os suits their needs best.

bomber monkey says: june 28, 2011 at 6:15 pm admittedly, i seem to have caught you at a low point in your blog.
he seems to think that linux is the blueprint for all oses everywhere, so his limited knowledge of things such as access control lists based on half-baked linux add-ons makes him an expert on windows as well.
the point is in the tone you used when disagreeing with me, combined with your obvious lack of knowledge about windows (using windows doesn’t make you are an expert on os internals anymore than linux does).
they will use the specific gnu make dialect, breaking compatibility with bsd make.
i think my first response was perfectly friendly and constructive.
in fact, i wonder why i even approved your post at all, and even reply to it.
you also failed to ‘rise above’, by the way.

if my technical knowledge was shown to be lacking, start a technical debate on things i said wrong, not on what university i may have gone to, or what books i may have used there.
based on the benchmarks you linked to, i have to conclude that amd is doing better in dx11 than nvidia though.

this blog post is nothing but an enraged rant where *nothing* constructive was accomplished.

reply i kinda look at linux users as rebels without a cause.
you are entitled to your opinion ofcourse, but i don’t think it’s a good conversation-starter.
so in a way they’re no better than the windows users they despise for “not thinking about the os they choose”.
i was disappointed however to find that there isn’t a 64-bit binary (unlike far cry, crysis 1 and warhead/wars).
although nvidia has the absolute fastest option there, by a margin, you see that the radeons move up a few places in the ranks, going from dx9 to dx11.
you are entitled to your opinion ofcourse, but i don’t think it’s a good conversation-starter.
vms/windows nt provide a better case for this (although still not a very strong one, but since people usually compare to windows, well…).
that does not imply that *all* linux users are like that (which you can also read in the very first line of the aforementioned blog).
since linux and bsd are both unixes, we are supposed to be friends and not fight against each other.
well, not many people have come to your rescue, have they?reply scali, you seem to be a bit rude and overly aggressive in situations where they are not warranted.
however, once you’ve done that, they still compile on linux, so there is no reason why they wouldn’t have made it more portable and compatible in the first place.
i always do that, bit of an in-joke… a response on how some people like to write micro$oft or windoze etc.
i feel you can then provide better responses and continue with a constructive conversation.

nice of you to pick up on the deliberate non-capitalization of linux by the way (but not freebsd, for example *hint*).
regardless of how good a solution they may or may not be, the mere fact that these solutions have been created is clear proof that the original unix design itself was not as ‘secure’ as some people seem to think.
you can complain about it all you want, and show your lack of comprehension.
vms was built for anal organizations from the beginning, and commercial unixes mainly had them to get red book division c so they could sell stuff to the us government.
they also did a pretty poor job of preparing you for the real world — particularly the it real world — where people will respectfully disagree with you, often.
i use windows because of the games.
i don’t believe in censorship.
in fact, ms added acls to nt for the same reason, and until windows 2000/2003 they were ridiculed for doing a terrible job of it.
it has the largest userbase, as a result, the average linux user is also less knowledgeable than other *nix users.

so, he comes off with the usual arrogant and pedantic rhetoric: “you’re free to critique things but at least know your material beforehand”.
you can have your say, and defend yourself if you like.
i’m rising above feeding into this, but you’d do well to know that just because someone disagrees with you doesn’t mean they’re an idiot and you look absolutely silly when responding like this.

your conduct in this blog post made it quite apparent who the idiot is here.
the radeon 5870 overtakes the geforce 470 and nearly closes the gap with the geforce 560ti.
a true it professional knows how to use both, knows their best role, and actually contributes something to the craft instead of fighting with zeal against the tyranny of the other side.
i have not made a sweeping statement however, i just said there’s ‘an army’ of such people.
it also helps that i was hired by a university to develop an efficient acl-based security system for their typo3-based cms, as the size of the organization gave them trouble managing the security with just the built-in *nix-like owner/group/world security bits, or with existing acl-plugins.
there is no point in continuing the conversation, as jed has not bothered to respond to the last replies by myself and sune marcher.
also, no… bsd is an actual unix, linux is unix-like.
well, all the ones i mentioned are fully posix-compliant, which bsd and linux generally aren’t, so i don’t think i’m decontextualizing at all.
in fact, ms added acls to nt for the same reason, and until windows 2000/2003 they were ridiculed for doing a terrible job of it.

nvidia seems to dominate in performance lead.

they don’t wish to really be part of any kind of os that has a brand to it.

the fact that you made these digs shows at the very least that you are not capable of respectfully disagreeing (you made the digs, i didn’t make any digs, i merely confronted you with your own behaviour right here on my blog, which everyone can see for themselves), and is also an indication that you don’t have any real arguments to add to the discussion.
i already said i have read some of tanenbaum’s books.
linux has its share too.
sincerelyreply scali, i see you’re still a windbag.
it does help however that i have quite a bit of experience of developing on windows and various *nix-like oses, and that i have studied the os internals of windows and linux at university (with the great book “operating system concepts” by silberschatz and galvin).
i have not made a sweeping statement however, i just said there’s ‘an army’ of such people.
although nvidia has the absolute fastest option there, by a margin, you see that the radeons move up a few places in the ranks, going from dx9 to dx11.

i certainly have absolutely no idea who the heck you are, other than that you’ve made a lousy first impression.
in fact, i wonder why i even approved your post at all, and even reply to it.
so it quickly becomes very painful when you have to explain some very basic features of the win32api (which has been that way since 1993, unlike the acl patches and other things such as selinux and apparmor, which were introduced to hack similar security features into linux as an afterthought).
to be honest, this security debate is even more pointless than a language debate.
and again in your reply i can taste a level of arrogance that indicates that you think you are the more knowledgable and experienced of us.
but when someone like jed comes here, insults my knowledge for no apparent reason, and then just leaves a technical discussion without even having the decency to admit he was wrong, let alone apologize for his behaviour, then yes, i will tell someone like that exactly how i feel about them.
there is no point in continuing the conversation, as jed has not bothered to respond to the last replies by myself and sune marcher.
so i guess it’s a contemporary american kind of fame.
they don’t wish to really be part of any kind of os that has a brand to it.
instead of continuing on to explain acls and touch every topic, you continued it as a personal attack.
