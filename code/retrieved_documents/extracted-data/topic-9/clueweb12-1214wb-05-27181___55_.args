that being said, linux is more capable of being secured - it's configuration is less opaque and kernel and user space are better segmented from each other.security is an ever moving target, and no operating system is secure if the os hasn't been patched properly, or if passwords aren't protected properly.the fact that it comes from a unix design heritage (as opposed to the desktop single-user model that windows has evolved from) leads to much better system administration tools and practices.i think the only os that can be called "inherently more secure" is openbsd, and it accomplishes that by sacrificing a lot of functionality, which diminishes the surface of attack.there is no differentiation between a user installing a pure user mode application and a device driver  no matter how malicious the intent of a user mode app, if the os is secure and intact, the user mode app can only affect the user that installed the program and the file which he has access to.keeping it secure requires keeping the system up to date and watching what's going on, just like any other system.running in user mode, or using the compatibility template if absolutely necessary, would stop some viruses from installing, but as has been said, in a corporate network everybody is normally running as a user with limited rights.no matter how malicious the intent of a user mode app, if the os is secure and intact, the user mode app can only affect the user that installed the program and the file which he has access to.while win32 maintains a very robust kernel and chacl capability, the security is almost universally overridden by the default installation of assining all users as admin.debian's update system is automatic, free, reliable, fast, and (if you use the "stable" distribution) designed *specifically* for administrators who don't want to spend a lot of time messing around with running systems.for this reason alone, linux is much more securable than windows.if you run as a user all your important files are going to be owned by that user, so a program could overwrite them anywayunix, out of the box, provides a well defined multiuser environment which provides a well defined context with respect to who can install device drivers, who can change permissions, and who has access to what.i'm not a linux guru, but using the documentation available, and the wonderful gentoo http://www.gentoo.org distribution, i can keep my system (on 24/7, on adsl) up and running and at least fairly secure.i'm not a linux guru, but using the documentation available, and the wonderful gentoo  http://www.gentoo.org  distribution, i can keep my system (on 24/7, on adsl) up and running and at least fairly secure.
