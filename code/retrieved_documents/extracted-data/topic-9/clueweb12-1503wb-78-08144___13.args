although ibm backs their linux products, for the most part if you use linux you are on your own.
and even then the user would only be able to damage his or her home folder, all other users data will be left untouched, and all root system files would also remain untouched, because linux would require a root password to make changes to these files.
instead of using these applications you will need to use linux apps such as open office, the gimp image editor, the thunderbird email client, instead of the msn messenger you can use the gaim messenger, and you can use firefox as your web browser.
“linux has two parts, they include the kernel mentioned previously, and in most circumstances it will also include a graphical user interface, which runs atop the kernel” reference #3.
some distributions of linux include gentoo, and slackware, which due to the lack of a complete graphical environment is best, suited for linux experts, programmers, and other users that know their way around a command prompt.

in linux the kernel is open source, so if you have the know how, you can modify it in virtually any way that you see fit.
linux can even be configured to run on apples, ipod’s, or smart phones.
all of this configurability can be problematic sometimes, as you will have to make a decision on which desktop is right for you, and to make things easier on yourself you will need to only install applications that are native to your distribution and graphical environment.
with linux you will for the most part be forced to let go of the familiar applications that you have grown accustomed to with windows, in favor of lesser-known open source apps that are made for linux.
these do not have to be installed by you at all unlike kubuntu.
with linux on the other hand problems with viruses are practically non-existent, and in reality you do not even need virus protection for your linux machine.
other advantages include the ability to rescue a broken linux system.
distributions that lack a graphical environment are best suited for older computers lacking the processing power necessary to process graphics, or for computers performing processor intensive task, where it is desirable to have all of the system resources focused on the task at hand, rather than wasting resources by processing graphics.
due to the fact that the kernel is open source, linux has a huge advantage over windows in configurability.

the author has developed a website dedicated to the excalibur food dehydrator of which he is a big fan.
with linux rather than having to buy an upgrade cd, you can install updates by downloading and then installing them while your desktop is running.
the kernel is the underlying computer code, used to communicate with hardware, and other system software, it also runs all of the basic functions of the computer.
the command line allows you to run the computer without a gui, by executing commands from a text-based interface.
a more important reason is that running a virus on a linux machine is more difficult and requires a lot more input from the user.
we also commented on the fact that the linux kernel and much of the applications used with it are completely free of charge, where as with windows you are forced to pay for most of the software.
it can be configured to manage the visual appearance of display windows and control panels.

it was really fast, too, since it booted itself entirely into the minuscule ram on the computer!
unlike widows linux is often lacking in professional tech support, and linux users are often left on their own to solve technical issues.
the cost effectiveness of linux is another way it separates itself from windows.
although windows offers its control panel to help users configure the computer to their liking, it does not match the configuring options that linux provides especially if you are a real tech savvy user.
kde aims to make an easy to use desktop environment without sacrificing configurability.
an example would be if you were trying to install software that was made for the kde graphical environment, on the gnome gui, this app would not easily install on the gnome gui, and would require some configuring on your part to successfully install it.
if you are using the kde edition of mint, then you probably love the new plasma and don’t mind the extra resources that this uses over the old kde 3.
