a monolithic kernel is more efficient because processes don't have to move in and out of the kernel.email may be published at our discretion unless marked "not for publication"; email addresses will not be published without permission, and we will encrypt them in hopes of avoiding spammers.but the core of linux is solid, powerful, efficient, and doesn't get as bogged down with multithreading as the mac os.this is due in large part to the overhead of moving in and out of the kernel, a context switch, in order to move data between the various applications and servers.the current wikipedia article puts it thus: microkernels generally underperform in comparison to traditional designs, sometimes dramatically.additional company and product names may be trademarks or registered trademarks and are hereby acknowledged.configuring the mac's built-in screen sharing to work over the internet can be difficult or impossible.the g3 processor was optimized for real world mac software and made a big leap forward in efficiency.they know that os x should have been built on a linux foundation - and they think linux is accessible to the masses.they know that os x should have been built on a linux foundation - and they think linux is accessible to the masses.apple will begin migrating macs to intel cpus, and the new "macintel" computers will be able to run windows, linux x86, and mac os x. windows does a lot of things right, but the underlying operating system is so full of holes it makes swiss cheese look solid.apple will begin migrating macs to intel cpus, and the new "macintel" computers will be able to run windows, linux x86, and mac os x. windows does a lot of things right, but the underlying operating system is so full of holes it makes swiss cheese look solid.in fact, linux is so robust that ibm has embraced it.ubuntu installs all sorts of useful applications - firefox, chat and email software, an office suite, several games.every program written for os x (as opposed to ported from linux or unix) installs easily.
