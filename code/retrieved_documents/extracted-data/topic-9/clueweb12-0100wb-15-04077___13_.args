having the source code allows you to compile your own kernel just the way you want it, or to suit the needs of your hardware or application.it has all the facilities, features and tools you would expect of a commercial unix and some significant plus points - it will run on ordinary low-cost pcs, software for linux is mostly free and commercial software is inexpensive, support is excellent and ongoing development is certainly dynamic!it has all the facilities, features and tools you would expect of a commercial unix and some significant plus points - it will run on ordinary low-cost pcs, software for linux is mostly free and commercial software is inexpensive, support is excellent and ongoingdistributions vary in what they offer, in the range of software provided and in the ease of installation but all will give you a fully-functional linux system when installed.this will never happen to linux - it is owned by a community, not a company or software house, and there is no way anyone (no, not even microsoft) can stifle it by buying it.microsoft windows is relatively slow, unstable, is much less well-documented at a technical level and is such a mess internally that ms daren't fix the bugs for fear of either introducing more bugs or preventing existing applications that have been written around the bugs from working properly.it is fast & efficient - equalling and in many cases exceeding the performance of other unixes such as solaris.and now dell, hewlett-packard and even ibm have seen the light and are actively supporting linux by investing in linux distribution vendors, offering it as a factory-installed alternative to microsoft winodws and providing support for linux in the corporate workplace.i want to get things done with my computers and i want to trust and rely on them - and that simply means a 100% reliable operating system: linux is that operating system.some versions are intended for typical office use while others are more suited to programmers but the important thing is that you can always add software and utilities to make your system do what you want it to do.commercial vendors may make a small charge for distributing it (eg, on cd-rom media for example) but they must comply with the terms of the gpl.you are also free to add extra features to it to be included in the next general public release of the kernel, as long as you also make available the source code with your enhancements.but let no-one be deluded - microsoft's ultimate goal is total world domination in both operating systems and applications software, both on the desktop and in the corporate server market, making serious inroads into territory previously the sole preserve of mainframes and unix.development is driven by the needs of its own users, not some marketing department seeking fresh sources of revenue.together with a typical range of application packages (which require huge amounts of disk space), windows also costs a lot of money.
