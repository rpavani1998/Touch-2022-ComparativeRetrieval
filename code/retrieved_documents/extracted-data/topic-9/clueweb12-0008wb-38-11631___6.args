not only for the reduced direct costs, but also the elimination of the (many) hassles of dealing with proprietary software licenses.
the linux community will talk about the free or low-cost nature of linux.
one could also argue that window - even nt - was not designed for multi-user environments and the the need to protect users - and programs - from each other.
linux as a desktop operating system makes no sense.
shortly linux will have three such file systems, however.
delivering a scalable system is a complex task and it's not clear that the linux community can solve these issues easily or quickly.2.2 delivered quite a few improvements; 2.4 will deliver quite a few more.
a user would end up with a system that has fewer applications, is more complex to use and manage, and is less intuitive.
nonetheless, it is important.
microsoft also claims that linux high-availability and clustering are "immature," which has a certain basis in truth.
linux lacks a commercial quality journaling file system.
administrators cannot delegate administrative privileges: a user who needs any administrative capability must be made a full administrator, which compromises best security practices.
we also humbly suggest the lwn security page as a central place to look to keep up on security issues.
therefore, commercial support services for linux will be fee-based and will likely be priced at a premium....as opposed to the wonderful free support services for windows nt...
for some users, linux will make a better desktop, for others it "makes no sense."
it's important to understand that licensing cost is only a small part of the overall decision-making process for customers.
the largest file size linux supports is 2 gb versus 16 terabytes (tb) for windows nt 4.0.
they must sign up for their distribution's security announcement list, and apply the updated packages when they are released.
this is made complex due to the fact that there isn't a central location for security issues to be reported and fixed.
microsoft, of course, completely avoids the issue of freedom, since they have no answer to that one.
the linux kernel has increasing support for capabilities, which provide the sort of fine-grained privileges needed, but support for capabilities at the user level will be a while in coming.
for some users, linux will make a better desktop, for others it "makes no sense."
they cite the june pc week benchmarks which did indeed show nt performing better.
this is certainly not the last that we will hear from them.
in addition, linux does not support many of the modern operating system features that windows nt 4.0 has pioneered such as asynchronous i/o, completion ports, and fine-grained kernel locks.
the file size limit is real (on 32-bit systems), and is a bit of a thorny problem - the 2.4 kernel will not fix it.
microsoft also claims that linux high-availability and clustering are "immature," which has a certain basis in truth.
the time gets significant when there are large numbers of systems to update, but that is true of nt "service packs" as well.
...as opposed to the wonderful free support services for windows nt... linux is a higher risk option than windows nt.
on performance: the linux community claims to have improved performance and scalability in the latest versions of the linux kernel (2.2), however it's clear that linux remains inferior to the windows nt® 4.0 operating system.
the linux swap file is limited to 128 mb ram.
the linux community likes to talk about linux as a stable and reliable operating system, yet there is no real world data or metrics and very limited customer evidence to back up these claims.
delivering a scalable system is a complex task and it's not clear that the linux community can solve these issues easily or quickly.
all systems are vulnerable to security issues, however it's important to note that linux uses the same security model as the original unix implementations- a model that was not designed from the ground up to be secure.
microsoft's claims of lower cost of ownership for nt fly in the face of the experience of large numbers of system and network administrators.
the linux community will talk about the free or low-cost nature of linux.
linux clustering is also highly successful in many situations.
the linux swap file is limited to 128 mb ram.
microsoft makes no mention of the difference in turnaround times - linux bugs are fixed much more quickly.
the swap file limit claim is simply false as of 2.2.0 (and even with previous versions one could use multiple swap files).
linux clustering is also highly successful in many situations.
one could also argue that window - even nt - was not designed for multi-user environments and the the need to protect users - and programs - from each other.
linux system administrators must spend huge amounts of time understanding the latest linux bugs and determining what to do about them.
this is certainly not the last that we will hear from them.
it's important to understand that licensing cost is only a small part of the overall decision-making process for customers.
linux can support 4gb with a commercially-supported patch.
the linux kernel has increasing support for capabilities, which provide the sort of fine-grained privileges needed, but support for capabilities at the user level will be a while in coming.
nt looks pretty risky to many of us.
microsoft's claims of lower cost of ownership for nt fly in the face of the experience of large numbers of system and network administrators.
the free (beer) side of linux is compelling, but is far from the most important feature of the operating system.
the largest file size linux supports is 2 gb versus 16 terabytes (tb) for windows nt 4.0.
not only for the reduced direct costs, but also the elimination of the (many) hassles of dealing with proprietary software licenses.
shortly linux will have three such file systems, however.
microsoft does not address performance on lower-end hardware.
linux system administrators must spend huge amounts of time understanding the latest linux bugs and determining what to do about them.
therefore, commercial support services for linux will be fee-based and will likely be priced at a premium.

the very definition of linux as an open software effort means that commercial companies like red hat will make money by charging for services.
microsoft makes no mention of the difference in turnaround times - linux bugs are fixed much more quickly.
linux only supports 2 gigabytes (gb) of ram on the x86 architecture, compared to 4 gb for windows nt 4.0.
as can be seen, microsoft's document is partially truthful, partially not.
