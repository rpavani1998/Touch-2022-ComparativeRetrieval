it's a very interesting and powerful system which is being developed at a breakneck pace and has vast potential.it has many powerful features; the installation was fairly straightforward and the user interface and documentation are excellent.you can also achieve your internet connection sharing by setting up a proxy server using linux.given the considerable rise in the number of virus and trojan attacks on windows that are happening lately, i am wondering if the primary machine would be safer running under linux.to make spam- and virus-filtering happen you have to "daisy-chain" multiple apps.i think you would be wise to create a dual boot so that you can begin to 'learn' if linux is a viable solution for you.hence, using deny instead of reject may have # the effect of frustrating attackers due to increasing the amount of # time taken to probe ports.be prepared to research and learn because linux is challenging.as none of the progs you've mentioned is available under linux you may want to take a brief look at what it would take (software- and effort-wise) to ensure the same functionality on your desktop-machine as you now have ... firewall every contemporary linux comes with a fw-module built into the "kernel" (the system-nucleus, so to say).# although such packets will not normally be processed by an application, # they can be used as part of a denial of service attack.you really have to have more than average experience, understanding and ability to deal with hardware and os in general.this is done via 'stateful packet inspection' provided by the # netfilter functionality added to linux as of kernel 2.4.posted 30 april 2004 - 01:15 pm linux will definitely be more stable and safe than windows xp.m$ phobia aside, i certainly 'would not' recommend that you switch from a system that you are familiar with, and, appear to have entirely under control to one that you don't know and that will require 'considerable' effort to learn well.but the gain is indeed immense: if you decide to go all the way and maybe even tweak/harden your box you will have a halluva bullet-proof and reliable machine that will let you forget about things like "reboot" and which will be "99% immortal" (unless you pull the plug)
