text based command line configuration and control can provide a comprehensive method for daily computer management and operation.although most linux distributions offer a graphical environment, to simplify the user experience, they all also offer a way for more technically involved users to directly communicate with the kernel via a shell or command line.(linux, openbsd, freebsd, netbsd, and solaris) these desktop environments provide users with the ability to utilize software developed with various computer languages, and the ability to utilize the software on different computer hardware configurations.due to the fact that the kernel is open source, linux has a huge advantage over windows in configurability.graphical user interfaces alleviate that requirement and make the use of a computer both simple and effective.windows simply suffers from far to many security vulnerabilities for it to be considered the better over all desktop environment.and of course the biggest difference in this writer’s opinion is the fact that linux does not suffer from an onslaught of viruses and other malicious code, unlike windows which is plagued by countless number of malicious code that can easily destroy your system if not properly guarded against.windows users are forced to employ third party anti virus software to help limit the possibility of the computer being rendered useless by malicious code.anti virus software often has the negative side effect of hogging system resources, thus slowing down your entire computer, also most anti virus software requires that you pay a subscription service, and that you constantly download updates in order to stay ahead of the intruders.distributions that lack a graphical environment are best suited for older computers lacking the processing power necessary to process graphics, or for computers performing processor intensive task, where it is desirable to have all of the system resources focused on the task at hand, rather than wasting resources by processing graphics.although windows offers its control panel to help users configure the computer to their liking, it does not match the configuring options that linux provides especially if you are a real tech savvy user.unlike windows in linux an executable file cannot run automatically, it needs to be given execute permissions manually this significantly improves security.distributions such as ubuntu, or linspire make linux far easier to use, by offering full-featured graphical environments that help eliminate the need for a command prompt.most linux users will find comfort in the fact that drivers for the latest hardware are constantly being written by coders throughout the world and are usually very quickly made available.linux is capable of running on devices as simple as a wrist watch, or a cell phone, but it can also run on a home computer using, for example intel, or amd processors, and its even capable of running on high end servers using sun sparc cpu’s or ibm power pc processors.
