there is a learning curve, and especially for a power user, it’s going to take time and effort to reach the same level of productivity.all of these can be installed also if one wants to and all offer good hardware support and a base selection of applications to try.(2) linux is about self-reliance, being open-minded, approaching problems in a logical manner and patience/persistance.the interface is consistent over time, unlike guis where there’s good reasons to rearrange things constantly or to have them vary from vendor to vendor.and along the way you may learn more about computer technology, feel more secure not being as concerned about viruses and malware and save on software costs, .the rewards of using linux (or one of the bsds) are self empowerment.the fact that every windows user is almost automatically “administrator” has caused enough trouble already, like spyware, virusses, etc.the lack of viruses and malware makes the maintenance of my home systems incredibly easy.linux has the same potential for gaming as long as distro are as good and easy for windows convert (read windows converts not newbies) to try them and this will result in developers recognising potential in linux therefore break the evil monopoly of non-standard coder in microsoft products.if something crashes you can boot with minimal settings and still correct a damaged “ini” file using the cli and a very simple editor.running everything in memory … you’re safe from viruses and malware.*** linux …it’s totally different, similar to unix, bsd but requires research and , depending on your skills, some time to get comfortable with it.you known exactly what your pc is doing and can make it do what you want and make it into a tool that fits your needs.i worked in my employer’s it department for three years and have set up both linux and windows servers and i have about 18 – 20 years of experience with computers overall.however, there will be some learning curve for all users, and if you’re not willing to take the time and effort to overcome that, then “stick with what you know” is the best advice.
