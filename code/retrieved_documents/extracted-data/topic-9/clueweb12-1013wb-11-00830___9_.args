unix-like operating systems were generally found to be better, having advantages such as higher reliability and lower cost.one of the largest advantages of linux is the availability of source code, which allows you to modify programs to suit your taste... assuming you know how.furthermore, because most linux authors receive no compensation whatsoever from an additional user using their software, there is no incentive for them to make it easier for non-technical people to use.even if other people at the company use the computers, the advantage of having computers which are more easily maintained by the experts is often enough to outweigh the fact that they may be slightly harder to use by the users (particularly since there are in-house experts to help).this is time which the developer would otherwise have spent making the software better, for the sake of assisting incompetent users who will never contribute anything useful.this is the fundamental reason that linux differs so much from proprietary operating systems.they will never be able to achieve the same level of success as microsoft or apple, however, because they cannot mandate changes to the underlying functionality to support ease-of-use like microsoft and apple can.furthermore, because their value is derived from the use of it, it is in their best interests to allow other people to improve upon it.because these people are, by definition, programmers, most of the software is tailored to be used by someone as technically proficient as a programmer.the system administrators generally know enough about what they're doing that linux would be advantageous for them.linux is tailored for the technically proficient remember that authors of linux software are generally people who want to use the software they write.with linux, most customers are wrong as discussed above, some linux distributions which sell their product want to keep their customers happy, and want to appeal to as many customers as possible.this means it also comes with source code, which means that you can modify it to make a custom version, something that is not possible (and is actually illegal even when it is technically possible) with proprietary software such as microsoft windows.using an environment such as linux will not encourage people to learn, because if they are not already inclined to learn and be curious, they will never notice any of the important differences between linux and windows!this is linux linux is not unix, but it operates in a similar fashion, with the same fundamental constructs, and even commands which mostly have the same names and take compatible options.
