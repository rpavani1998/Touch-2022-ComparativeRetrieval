overall the server/diskless workstation was a very good fit for the clients' needs; it was reliable, fast (the 10 mbps network was faster than contemporary ide drives) and easy to maintain (all the configuration files were in one place).we don't like the licence (it's a potential problem for most solicitors/lawyers and anyone else with a duty of confidentiality), we don't like the desktop (it's an insult), we don't like the vulnerabilities, or the slow performance, or the sheer undocumented mass of it all.in fact, for both these extremes the issues are arguably simpler: at one end it's just personal choice of platform, at the other the resources are available to implement customised solutions as needed.people who still like windows, use windows grudgingly, or deal with linux-windows integration in lans will also find the information useful.this sme area is price-sensitive, hasn't upgraded for years, has no it management: it's where linux can make a difference, and it's where i reckon it's hardest for linux to enter - for reasons that i will describe later.it was pretty solid, pretty easy to use, fast, adequately tuned, and a good desktop system.any minor configuration error was often fatal.windows 95 was effective - it's a masterpiece of forward and backward compatibility in my view - but it was not stable.i've noticed that people with a unix background often have had little contact with those who have been weaned on dos - and vice versa.moreover, gnu/linux has over the last few years transformed its graphical desktop capacity.not only that, all the hardware was readily available and used standard parts (the diskless workstations needed specific types of psu and weren't easily upgradeable).they had introduced large-scale management tools, which merely muddied the waters for our typical installs of 5 to 10 clients, and it cost more than version 3.x.any company that exploits a monopoly in this way develops users who detest it.yes, windows and windows networking at that time actually represented more 'freedom' for these people, and eventually the lab sun systems were retired and sold off.windows 2000 server, 2000 as or especially windows server 2003 are a ridiculous overkill for an office with six client machines, as well as being much more expensive and needing huge hardware resources to run.
