i have it folding but for some reason (not yet identified) fahmon will not give results.
good luck on your ppd, we'll see in a couple of days.
jeez, they just got their gpu2 beta cores going very nicely now after a hiccup last november.
compile your own little kernel in *nix, though *nix smp has to be the x64 version as i'm running in vmware atm.
freebsd is the only other thing i'd say compared to the responsiveness of the system.
i have gentoo installed on another partition on my computer, though grub is broken atm due to installing windows 7.

moderators: forum experts, management forum rules welcome to our modest though robust team of folders!
i do know that my gentoo install was faster than anything else i've used before as it was a very stipped down kernel and since everything installed from source, it was all compiled just for my system.

hey, try smp in vmware and see if it works in w7, it would be interesting to know.
maybe it's just because lately i've been doing a little bit more than i did with vista, but all of the wu that i'm getting seem to be taking about 6-8 hrs longer now than they did previously.
you are all more than welcome to join us or ask specific questions about how to go about folding but please start a new thread to post your questions, this way nothing of importance will be lost and everyone here will help you out.

if you just want to chat folding then the folding@home home thread will be great!

i'm trying to get it working but i can't get the necessary files installed (via install.bat) to get the core running and i checked over at the folding forum and it doesn't appear as though anyone over there is running w7 just yet, though they do have a placeholder for comments.

still learning logic can get you from a to b
i think the issue was due to a space being in the directory that it was installed to.

unfortunately, i don't want to run a 64-bit version of linux without going full 64-bit, which isn't quite possible yet.
fahmon will not give results.
maybe since windows 7 is less resource hungry than vista i'll have a better ppd average now.

i had a hard time getting fahmon to display too, but it was my fault as i had it pointing to the wrong directory as it is a little bit different for whatever reason in window 7 game over!!!!!!!!

i'll be installing w7 shortly so we can then compare notes on folding.
everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves.
