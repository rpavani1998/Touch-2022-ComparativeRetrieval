this is a good solution for casual gamers.it's meant for windows (or mac) users trying to figure out what "linux" is, what it looks like, and see whether there's anything good for them in it.i'm just an extremely happy user and developer of linux, trying to make more people get to know about linux.if you start explaining this, the fact that linux is the kernel's name, and that different vendors choose to ship linux with their choice of software to make a "linux distribution", etc., half of the audience has already left.this is not a website for people already using linux as their main os (unless they want to help out making the site better).2) give a few reasons why linux is a really good system, and why most of the time it is a pretty good choice.i'm a member of ubuntu, i have been using linux since ~1998, wrote a few pocket books (in french) about some open source software (firefox, linux, etc.).a: i agree that various software solutions make running windows games under linux much easier than it used to be.like many other people, i have lots of things to do, and while i'm glad to help out when i can and have time for it, i am sure many people out there in forums or irc channels will be more than glad toanswer your questions!my screenshots mostly show ubuntu because that's the distribution i use and develop for.for the same reasons, and for the sake of simplicity, i don't speak about the various bsds and the fact that many of thebig servers run bsd and not linux.i love and use a lot of kde apps (if all the efforts put about gnome vs kde trolls could be invested in nicely integrating kde apps in gnome and the other way around, i'd be really happy).and if you're a native english speaker, please report proof of my bad english to the same address, so that i can correct my mistakes.however, note that i used the expression "hardcore gamers", the ones who buy the most recent games and overclock their cpus to get better performance; i doubt that these are willing to make that kind of compromise.a: on a website for advanced linux users, detail like this would matter, however i am wanting to keep things fairly simple.
