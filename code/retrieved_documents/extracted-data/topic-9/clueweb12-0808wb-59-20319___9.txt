how many applications do you have for  your new platform?
a lot of universities here and abroad are still using windows, it's a fact.
if big companies are  looking for these professionals, universities will have no choice but to offer  curriculums that are ms technology related, this will again ensure the future  of the windows platform.
no wonder, have you visited some big companies in  your area, like banks, for instance, is your rural bank using linux?
anonymous said,  july 9, 2009 6:13 am i would add that linux is what the user wants and microsoft is what the big  businesses want.
and yes no system is entirely secure but windows does not even come  close to being secure ;).
i run linux for like an month, and yet no security breach occured.
anonymous said,  july 10, 2009 9:57 am the biggest problem with this observation is that it's based on an  individuals experience on a particular os popularity or os usability.
you don't  even need best gear to run most of needed tools nd games built for linux.
i like the simple fact that there is nothing new in these posts from posts 8 years ago.
i'm glad there are fixes for corficker.
these two items account for about 60% of their annual revenue.
nafees said,  july 9, 2009 4:30
i have been using linux for 4 years now.
linux gets developed by a community of people who are willing solve problems and share not just their solutions, but how their solutions work.
jacques merde said,  july 9, 2009 5:21 am games games and more games!
just the fact that there is no licensing tracking involved in open source alone is huge.
30 years after the nimble microsoft outmanouvered the lumbering big blue, the tables have turned, and microsoft are now the elephant in the living room.
i use linux for a variety of reasons such  as it's security, cost, and stability.
as microsoft has 80% of the desktop market, i think you tell where i  am going with this one.
that is scary for  m$.
trying to change behavior of  the user community like it's a child you want to stay in bed by a boogy man  microsoft under the bed is a failure.
if your choice is new machine and  win7 or switch to a mac (and replace all your apps with a mac version), well  the new machine/win7 upgrade is _both_ cheaper and more familiar.
anonymous said,  july 9, 2009 5:47 am "...pretty much every os in the planet have (sic) security  issues..."
yes, any 3rd party commercial vendor needs to go through the same pain in porting their proprietary app on either platform, its just that until vendors move their wares, windows on arm or any other hardware platform (without drivers or apps) is patently useless.
ryan said,  july 9, 2009 5:02
man, some of these comment's...
i know i used  to work there.
to run win7 pretty much requires a new(ish) computer and they mean to end-of-life xp to force you to move (so they can get paid).
what we use is software these two platforms provide.
but i bet you will see a lot of windows machine.
in fact...i listen to music while i play....so there's another performance benefit.
http://forums.techarena.in/vista-security/1150576.htm 4.
its no wonder that because of games on windhoze machine no serious development is being done.
your original point seemed to be that malware is not  a problem on more recent versions of windows.
" because your so stupid to know that you are being hacked.
like  they release chrome for windows first before your linux.
i can now run 3 vm's simultaneously...while listening to  music on the free rhythmbox...with still plenty of memory & disk space left  over.
next up, "ms isn't afraid of linux teh own the software world, apple has more market share than linux".
m$'s  own numbers show gnu/linux at abut twice the rate of macos.
solutions are sold, not  shared.
windowsce is not proof of windows portability to arm.
the year of the  linux desktop is unknown, but the future is bright.
i cited cornficker to demonstrate  that even the most recent version of windows has security problems which linux  users do not have to deal with.
sorry in advance for the length of this post.
open source isn't  available for everything, but what is out there is great stuff.
the only thing that i think that isn't all to on the ball with the linux thing is firefox.
if i want a game console, i'll buy a  ps3.
their monopoly starts bleeding from every socket, just like ie is  doing to firefox.
cloud computing,  which makes os's (and a lot of software in general) irrelevant, is what ms is  worried about."
our operating systems on our three computers which are a 9 year old emachines, a 3 year old dell laptop and an aspire one: antix and fedora.
linux can very quickly move the whole stack, kernel, drivers and oss apps; and be useful relatively quickly.
anonymous said,  july 9, 2009 3:02 pm # dd if=/home/idiots of=/dev/null that does copy, not move.
on my linux run computer, i can dig into any file of any program and learn how that program works.
vista was a huge blow for ms, a lot hangs on win7 and linux will play its part but its xp that win7 has to eat.
unless if they stop making firefox for windows you will see it as an advantage.
portability - your argument is confusing, are you comparing to apple or  ms here?
if your grandparents (you can training them now) have started using linux then you are right, that ms needs to be very afraid of linux, if that's not happening yet then shut your mouth and get a life.
in terms of quality, they can  rival any proprietary software made for windows.
it's a completely different operating system that happens to be made by the same company and gets called by a similar name.
unless if they stop making  firefox for windows you will see it as an advantage.
software can be installed on the user's computer without the user's knowledge.
see above, the advantage is no windows.
you need to wait  for all the hardware vendors to port and release their apps too.
windows is sort of portable.
i have no  idea why you bring up rural banks.
once they settle into foss products, switching the o/s behind these products is the next step.
i won't repeat my previous post.
sure some folks might know of all three choices, windows, mac and linux and still choose windows for some reason (maybe games or cad work or business accounting) but the majority of the windows computers/users don't fall in those categories.
plus, i myself like opera - which works even on windows 98se, and is a bit faster (my cpu is slow enough to make the difference noticeable).
i open up my package manager, search for what i want in the search box, click on it, click on apply, and wait for the program to install itself.
the truth is  that linux is slowly becoming more known, which is putting a dent in  microsoft's profits.
nowadays, itâ€™s like if  you can do it on windows, you can do it on linux too.
and you forgot to log in as root!
why should that be a hindrance?
you want to work  use linux.
the graph showing os  market share percentages has the same size wedge for linux as there is for osx,  same size wedge = same size market share.
i'm sure some trolls will say: "i *use* my o/s" to counter argue me.
regarding penetration of desktop market, only one of the 3 computers we own were purchased with linux on it.
anonymous said,  july 9, 2009 7:55 pm err, i meant to say that, "linux is closer to being the same operating  system as os x (not the old macos) than windowsce is to being the same  operating system as windows 7 (or any other member of the nt series).
i can even make any changes i want.
my point remains the same: the *average* user, that notorious "joe sixpack" gets frustrated when his pc slows to a crawl.
also i'd rather get actual work done on my pc without getting bsod or my system slowing down.
linux is more secure than even the most recent versions of windows.
aquaadverse said,  july 9, 2009 10:38
"$mv all_idiots_in_here /dev/null" oh noes!
just the fact  that there is no licensing tracking involved in open source alone is huge.
opera, lynx, w3c, dillo, the list goes on.
(i agree with you on the no os is completely secure)
linux undermines the very  foundations of its business model.
and there's nothing quite so influential as a pc technician who's linux savvy: far more effective that a penguinista or a windows troll.
i look forward to seeing more like it to come.
the same cannot be said running vista business x64, or even windows 7 x64 (even removed the extras) for that matter.
however, rather than tossing them into the linux swimming pool, i let them wade in by replacing their corrent proprietary software with foss variants.
ms knows they cant beat linux/foss on price or quality, they can't buy out the  underlying software that oss companies are based on.
oh  and notice the url it's arm, let me guess you will windowsce is not windows  because of ce.
while penguinistas are wasting time and effort with paranoid conspiracy theories and ignoring the simple fact consumers stick with what they know.
a) applications: not much use  if your computer is a virus and worm infected spambot.
linux is open, so its capabilities are known and new features can be added, old  ones removed.
applications: not much use if your  computer is a virus and worm infected spambot.
if this will not change then i think ms have no reason  to be scared at all.
b) sure, many games aren't aviable for linux.
altough, firefox is not the best example.
if a windows guy is stating facts it's fud if it's coming from  linux a**holes it's not.
but have you ever wondered why people at microsoft and evenbill  gates himself are bothered by linux more than anything else?
yes, for any os, the drivers and apps need to be recompiled along with the os kernel and others subsystems.
can you plug in all your desktop peripherals and use them?
are linux bigots so stupid to understand this?
window  manager like openbox makes you work lighting fast as soon as you get used to  configuration you choose.
i would add that linux is what the user wants and microsoft is what the big businesses want.
anonymous said,  july 9, 2009 4:55 pm
retailers would be fine selling machines with linux pre-installed but if  customers even know what it is, they think it it's for geeks or have been  seeing a couple of years of rabid linux advocates leaving strange comments in  forums and threads that are virulent anti-redmond and have almost nothing to do  with with the subject.
that someone like me, with no training in it other than one class 27 years ago can install and run linux, that non professionals like my wife can use linux, that kids from my neighborhood, which is far from a wealthy neighborhood can use linux more than proves that linux is quite useable.
the old security canard "no  os is completely safe, so therefore windows security doesn't suck" that's like saying since no building can stop every thief your shitty apartment  with a $15 deadbolt is as secure as fort knox.
the guy  who sees 50 machines in his section, is checking out dvds, giving info at the  dentist and basically seeing almost every transaction done on a windows pc  isn't buying it.

cchnda said,  july 14, 2009 2:30
my response to the windows/linux flamewar is always the same: no one really *uses* windows or linux.
you see what ms is afraid  of is they need people to buy win7 and office whatever-the-latest version-is.
even one of the safest os  (openbsd) in the planet have vulnerabilities.
timdor said,  july 8, 2009 10:46 pm
applications: not much use if your computer is a virus and worm infected spambot.
windows portability", i did not say it means  portability, i just corrected mr. timdor when he erroneously bragged that  windows don't support arm.
linux already has support for most hardware  architectures.
that is scary for m$.
yes, the standard windows fud from the anonymous troll.
this is ms number one main concern, not the one listed by the author of this site and being defended by morons here.
while there is the uac built into vista, unfortunately,  i've still seen virii come through, and have even tested the conficker worm  myself.
that you  would mention windows ce as proof of windows portability proves that you know  even less about computers than i do.
i've heard tell of c & c++ apps running in linux with some recompiling (not sure how true that is).
i should also mention, that many windows games can be played through wine, if that really is your thing.
security: cornficker infects vista too.
yeah, i think somebody actually managed to break into fort knox once, just once.
windowsce is not the same operating system as the windows  nt series.
it might  be that linux is popular on some areas while in some other parts of the world
linux can very quickly  move the whole stack, kernel, drivers and oss apps; and be useful relatively  quickly.
anonymous said,  july 9, 2009 6:56 am all good and fine, but when will the day arise, where we won't waste our  time wondering what's happening in the minds of the markting divisions of  closed-source outfits ?!
it's time for the linux community to growup.
yes,  for any os, the drivers and apps need to be recompiled along with the os kernel  and others subsystems.
it's puzzling all the buzz from the linux community centered on fighting for scrapes with apple while microsoft was filling in holes with products like sharepoint and dynamics.
you need to wait for all the hardware vendors to port and release their drivers.
how many applications do you have for your new platform?
i would thing that it would put the company in a better position, as it doesn't require a specific os, and therefore is not dependent on the specific os, which in turn offers additional security flaws and vulnerabilities.
most games will run on wine with some tweaking, even crysis(only on high graphics or above).
anything comes free finds taker stole breads, vegetables anything linux is that i think this is delicious, the picture in this article is from a slide being presented by ballmer at a shareholder meeting.
ok...games are fine i'm sure.....
warner said,  july 9, 2009 5:52 pm
my apologies in advance for feeding the trolls, however: 1.
also most users can't maintain their systems anyway
# dd if=/home/idiots of=/dev/null that does copy, not move.
and i used every windows since 3.11 (except server editions).
microsoft's practices are the antithesis of this philosophy of freedom.
that means linux  can run on anything from a dedicated appliance to a supercomputer.
dont have to use firefox can use anything.
it would smooth the way for consumer acceptance.
if the owner says they use coreldraw, photoshop: software they paid good money for, then i suggest an alternative: boot to win to work these, but keep win off the net, boot to lin to surf, etc.
the truth is ms *is* afraid  of linux/foss, according to their own quotes.
remember -  fud works both ways, and this time you were the one to start fudwar.
information is locked into closed proprietary formats.
congratulations on displaying less maturity than these 11 year  olds.
i've seen so many closed source applications that  are garbage, and cost way more than what they should.
microsoft's business model is founded upon the notion that those using its  products are to be nothing more than passive consumers of its products.
i'm even happier that as a linux user, i don't have to worry about finding solutions to such problems.
that's the best time to compare his glorious windows box with my set up: faster boot time, similar software choices, better menu organization, etc.
portability - your argument is confusing, are you comparing to apple or ms here?
as a teacher, i help my students to become more free as individuals.
i bet noone can do that with windows nor macos.
but, usage of wine or cedega shortens this list.
registry cleaner, what is a registry?
it's a completely different operating system that happens to be made  by the same company and gets called by a similar name.
only computer class i ever had was back in 1982.
linux undermines the very foundations of its business model.
cost/useability - i am an elementary school teacher, wife a social worker.
even though firefox does run on linux it also runs on windows.
given the number of windows computers used in big compaines, have you heard anyone going out of business because of your cornficker worm?
the code is not the  same; the apis are not the same.
ms got to be where they are by being the cheapest, their whole company was built on it.
personally, i play wow through wine, with no performance loss.

they learn to live with things like: no more pimping of their instant messenger clients, etc.
software is not shared, not even sold, but licensed.

firefox - the last time i check, firefox also runs on windows, so what's the advantage of linux here?
just to be clear about one thing.
problem is, in this brave new world of alternate devices, as soon as a new hardware platform emerges, linux will be far better able to fill the niche quickly than the lumbering beast of redmond.

it does run on both os's.
its no wonder that because of games on  windhoze machine no serious development is being done.
during the vista fiasco microsoft had record revenue because their server product line was exhibiting double digit growth, while the client services, windows desktop, showed a -8% shrink.
what happens when ms pushes for the next round of upgrade cash and the average consumer has become aware of an alternative that is as easy to use as osx and the cheapest of all, free.
lack of games  is the fault of the publisher not linux.
windows portability", i did not say it means portability, i just corrected mr. timdor when he erroneously bragged that windows don't support arm.
as has already been stated by others windows ce is completely different  from windows xp or windows 7.

in short we have our own biases.
part of the reason why ms will still  survive even with the growing popularity of linux is that a lot of big  companies uses windows for internal and external operations, the rise of .net
that you would mention windows ce as proof of windows portability proves that you know even less about computers than i do.

sorry vista, but the short fact remains...most viruses built are built  to target the ms windows os, whether that be xp, vista, or 7.
like they release chrome for windows first before your linux.
none of them currently run  windows, yet based on how statistics regarding os use seem to be gathered, 2  out of 3 computers in my household are windows computers.
the only machine that is safe from hacking and trojan are those machine that are turned off.
anything can be hacked.
i've seen so many closed source applications that are garbage, and cost way more than what they should.
in their own figures unlicensed copies of their own software are still a  large concern.
i have been running ubuntu and debian distributions for over 4 years now without antiviral software nor a firewall, and the number of virus, spyware, etc., attacks that i have suffered total zero!!!!
err, i meant to say that, "linux is closer to being the same operating system as os x (not the old macos) than windowsce is to being the same operating system as windows 7 (or any other member of the nt series).
try visiting a universities like here in cebu, i don't know how many have  installed linux.
linux server shipments have been growing at a faster rate than windows for  several years now.
cost - i'm a windows user....sure...but only through virtualbox now.
linux is portable and scalable.
this fiscal environment should have ceos and cios and cfos slapping in linux servers like crazy.
if apple can triple it's marketshare during vista with a $1,000+ entry fee while linux barely moved the needle, it's pretty easy to draw the conclusion the current strategy won't work.

mu buddy got linux running on some low-standard mp4 (not an ipod, not a creative).
that means i as a computer user have  the opportunity to not just use these software solutions, but to learn how  these solutions work.
the results are various.
some people will like linux and some people  will always prefer using windows or mac (believe it or not i did see a company  that are still using windows 98).
even if it's popular a lot of people have different preferences on what they conceive easy and difficult to use.
windows 7 is going to slam shut whatever slim chance this current strategy window had for success.

the only firewall they have  against linux is awareness/familiarity.
i had been reading about ms thinking linus's share was on par with osx, nice to finally find an example.
windowsce is not proof of windows  portability to arm.
the only reason i can see for you giving such an immature response is  because you realize that any windows machine can easily become a virus and worm  infected spambot unless up to date antivirus and antimalware programs are  constantly running in the background.
i'd rather mention iceweasel, konqueror and other linux-natixe browsers that are unusable at windows.
am microsoft isn't afraid of either apple or linux because apple can't support  the enterprise and remain apple, and linux went ubuntu blind and you don't ever  hear anything pertaining to linux except the desktop.
m$'s own numbers show gnu/linux at abut twice the rate of macos.
meanwhile, apple's mac os x is tightly  locked on its own hardware so i don't see its growth as long-term.

linux's primary distribution  method is not through retail channels, it's count is under reported.
i know it's hard to promote a product that costs nothing.
i should also mention, that many  windows games can be played through wine, if that really is your thing.
because ordinary users  don't give a damn if your linux is cool because you can compile your programs  yourselves.
more importantly, i use it because the philosophy underlying linux is very similar to my philosophy as an educator.

furthermore, games that run on both windows and  native linux tend to work faster at linux than on windows.
some more observations on why microsoft should be scared.
tell me did linux already penetrated the desktop market?
sorry vista, but the short fact remains...most viruses built are built to target the ms windows os, whether that be xp, vista, or 7.
i can still get in your shitty apartment with a hammer, good luck trying that with fort knox.
linux gets developed by a  community of people who are willing solve problems and share not just their  solutions, but how their solutions work.
while i am a ms sw engineer, i prefer to use fedora 11 x86_64  (gnome) as my desktop.
what's the point of  having many office apps if due to some viruss you can't even use them?

as long as the current state of the desktop linux remains the same there's nothing ms needs to be afraid of.
the majority of users had  windows chosen for them by virtue of ms's (now failing) strangle hold on oems  and their conscious choice to *not* by a mac, generally based on price.
so a user friendly linux alternative is actually a viable sollution in the future.
applications - let  me give you a nice rebuttal for choosing windows.
so there's another performance benefit.
windows biggest comeptitor is windows, thats what keeps them awake at night in redmond.
how many hardware drivers do you have for your new platform?
microsoft  isn't going to like losing the oem license money from mac sales but virtually  every computer sold without osx has a microsoft license.
linux is open, so its capabilities are known and new features can be added, old ones removed.
am the only thing that i think that isn't all to on the ball with the linux  thing is firefox.
if i want a game console, i'll buy a ps3.
try visiting a universities like here in cebu, i don't know how many have installed linux.
i've heard tell of c & c++ apps running in linux  with some recompiling (not sure how true that is).
microsoft isn't going to like losing the oem license money from mac sales but virtually every computer sold without osx has a microsoft license.

timdor said,  july 10, 2009 1:56 am some more observations on why microsoft should be scared.
if the answer is: "word, excel, browsing, e-mail, photos, torrenting, movies, instant messaging, etc."
cost/useability - i am an elementary  school teacher, wife a social worker.
you don't even need best gear to run most of needed tools nd games built for linux.
given the number of windows computers used in big compaines, have you  heard anyone going out of business because of your cornficker worm?
microsoft has become accustomed to having little to no  competition the past decade, now they are getting a little.
i so saw that troll post coming.
you need to wait for all the hardware vendors to port and release their apps too.

microsoft was terrified of linux to point of a fud website, threatening to sue businesses for ip infringement and bribing...er investing in linux companies.
arm - http://www.arm.com/products/os/windowsce.html - go on read it, i'll wait.
(i  agree with you on the no os is completely secure)
i've been using ubuntu linux since 2005 with breezy badger.
firefox - the last time i check, firefox also runs on  windows, so what's the advantage of linux here?
personally, i'm a  firm believer of creating software that will run on any platform, independent  of the os.
portability.....what are you looking to port?
that means i as a computer user have the opportunity to not just use these software solutions, but to learn how these solutions work.
i think here are  the main reasons why: 1.
oh, and by the way, i doubt that guy is being hacked.
your original point seemed to be that malware is not a problem on more recent versions of windows.
they have nowhere to go but down.
crossing your arms, turning up your nose and demanding that the o/s *you* use is the best is often a sure sign of hidden insecurity.

while i do enjoy the performance gains of ie8, i don't appreciate the forcible nature that microsoft integrates some of the ie8 features and addons.
cuz, in the end... it's not whether windows or linux wins or who fears who, but it's about which system provides the best possible service to the user.
nothing but a rehash of tired arguments.
linux server shipments have been growing at a faster rate than windows for several years now.
then create a fat32 partition to share files between both systems.
try moving the whole windows  ecosystem like that.
open source isn't available for everything, but what is out there is great stuff.
openness knowledge is power, and a only microsoft knows what's inside windows, meaning only microsoft knows
windows is still plagued by dangerous viruses for example ransomware.
only computer class i ever had was back  in 1982.
you see what ms is afraid of is they need people to buy win7 and office whatever-the-latest version-is.
anonymous said,  july 9, 2009 11:25 am just a suggestion to the owner of this site instead of posting ms related  stuffs that only attracts trolls like me, why not start with something  constructive like, a better payroll software for linux or a quickbooks  alternative for linux, something that will attract small businesses and big  companies too, instead of ms fud and misinformation.
linux's share of the total server market is growing faster than windows, both at the expense of unix.
openness knowledge is power, and a only microsoft knows what's  inside windows, meaning only microsoft knows
part of the reason why ms will still survive even with the growing popularity of linux is that a lot of big companies uses windows for internal and external operations, the rise of .net related jobs is certainly a good indicator of this trend.
linux was started in a university setting.
linux's primary distribution method is not through retail channels, it's count is under reported.
security - this argument is valid only for windows xp  sp2 era.
i run linux for like an month, and yet no security breach  occured.
yeah, i think somebody  actually managed to break into fort knox once, just once.
somebody said,  july 9, 2009 10:07 am "$mv all_idiots_in_here /dev/null" oh noes!
games games and more games!
i use linux for a variety of reasons such as it's security, cost, and stability.
i have been running ubuntu and  debian distributions for over 4 years now without antiviral software nor a  firewall, and the number of virus, spyware, etc., attacks that i have suffered  total zero!!!!
dont have to use firefox can use  anything.
even though i am wasting my time i will respond once again to anonymous.
people should be using linux as a corporate desktop which has little in the way of issues a consumer desktop poses.
however in  response to your statement about compiling programs -- i am an elementary  school teacher.
and yes no system is entirely secure but windows does not even come close to being secure ;).
i'd rather mention iceweasel, konqueror and  other linux-natixe browsers that are unusable at windows.
withlinux getting better like becoming user-friendlier and more secure  than ever, people have a savior.
cloud computing, which makes os's (and a lot of software in general) irrelevant, is what ms is worried about.
jim said,  july 9, 2009 5:47 am *sigh*
if it's c or c++ based...how difficult is it really?
m$ is a dinosaur whose brain  has not gotten the message that they are in the tar pit.
the only machine that is safe from hacking  and trojan are those machine that are turned off.
"ubuntu is rapidly approaching osx's ease of use" bwahahahahaha.
more importantly, i use it because the  philosophy underlying linux is very similar to my philosophy as an educator.
linux is closer to being the same operating  system as macos than windowsce is to being the same operating system as windows  7 (or any other member of the nt series).
arm - windows running on that yet?

microsoft has every reason to be scared of linux.
ms does have a strnglinbg grip on the desktop pc market.
that someone like me, with no training in it  other than one class 27 years ago can install and run linux, that non  professionals like my wife can use linux, that kids from my neighborhood, which  is far from a wealthy neighborhood can use linux more than proves that linux is  quite useable.
it took microsoft about 10 minutes to blow past linux as the majority os on netbooks.
the old security canard "no os is completely safe, so therefore windows security doesn't suck" that's like saying since no building can stop every thief your shitty apartment with a $15 deadbolt is as secure as fort knox.
regarding penetration of desktop market, only one of the 3  computers we own were purchased with linux on it.
even google given there  sheer number of brilliant engineers recognize it as a dominant platform.
linux is free from  charge and there are many progs ready for use with most of distros.
funny thing about security is pretty much every os in the planet have security issues, in short everything is insecure even your dearest linux my friend.
the last  five people i switched to ubuntu are counted as windows users because that is  what came on their machines at purchase.
it would smooth the  way for consumer acceptance.
are they supported by operating system?
applications, applications, applications the number of great foss  applications that support linux are increasing.
never have i had to worry about malware while running this os.
but in  these difficult times people have learned to value their money more than ever  by spending it wisely.
let me end this with this statement.
if an interested party asks whether s/he should switch, i always ask: "why are you interested?
microsoft has become accustomed to having little to no competition the past decade, now they are getting a little.
funny thing about security is pretty much every os in the planet have  security issues, in short everything is insecure even your dearest linux my  friend.
even though firefox does run on linux it also runs on  windows.
the last five people i switched to ubuntu are counted as windows users because that is what came on their machines at purchase.
plus, i myself like  opera - which works even on windows 98se, and is a bit faster (my cpu is slow  enough to make the difference noticeable).
see above,  the advantage is no windows.
linux on the desktop is not what scares microsoft.
windows 7 is going to slam shut whatever  slim chance this current strategy window had for success.
if this will not change then i think ms have no reason to be scared at all.

on  the other hand: students at college or university can get microsoft operating  systems and some office programs for free and are legitimate to use it as long  as they study.
that means linux can run on anything from a dedicated appliance to a supercomputer.

the  windows pc will be shit slow.
if your choice is new machine and win7 or switch to a mac (and replace all your apps with a mac version), well the new machine/win7 upgrade is _both_ cheaper and more familiar.
you want to work use linux.

in their own figures unlicensed copies of their own software are still a large concern.
the only reason i can see for you giving such an immature response is because you realize that any windows machine can easily become a virus and worm infected spambot unless up to date antivirus and antimalware programs are constantly running in the background.

there's no doubt that  linux is a highly flexible operating system that can be easily modified to run  on just about anyelectronic device.
can you plug in all your desktop  peripherals and use them?
also most users can't maintain their systems  anyway
microsoft's business model is founded upon the notion that those using its products are to be nothing more than passive consumers of its products.
the future, maybe!(hopefully) peace out!
linux already has support for most hardware architectures.

mu  buddy got linux running on some low-standard mp4 (not an ipod, not a creative).
as a teacher, i help my students  to become more free as individuals.
anything can be  hacked.
yes, any 3rd party commercial vendor needs to go  through the same pain in porting their proprietary app on either platform, its  just that until vendors move their wares, windows on arm or any other hardware  platform (without drivers or apps) is patently useless.
i am quite comfortable with whatever choice my customers make.
problem is, in this brave new world of alternate devices, as soon as a new  hardware platform emerges, linux will be far better able to fill the niche  quickly than the lumbering beast of redmond.
firefox since firefox  has beenrapidly eating internet explorer's web browser market share, the free  and open source software community is more positive than ever that linux can be  as successful on the desktop.
all good and fine, but when will the day arise, where we won't waste our time wondering what's happening in the minds of the markting divisions of closed-source outfits ?!
linux sure is free but its capability is valuable.
that loyal customers prefer their 8 year old product over  current production is the biggest concern imho.
pm you can not analyse anything you cant afford your little brain to do  that.
because ordinary users don't give a damn if your linux is cool because you can compile your programs yourselves.
linux is free from charge and there are many progs ready for use with most of distros.
