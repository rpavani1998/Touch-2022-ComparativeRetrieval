then, following a brief foray in os/2, i quickly gravitated to running linux at home so i could once again have a real multi-tasking working environment.

i started using a unix desktop way back in college and was always comfortable there.

at my first couple of jobs after college, i mostly used unix workstations from dec and sun as my primary desktops.
in particular, the notion of an administrative (root) user that maintains and operates the system, and desktop users who only run the software on the system, is completely ingrained in most linux distributions.
the system defaults to protecting the operating system components from its user’s actions (intentional or otherwise).
to complete that trifecta, i guess its only fair to compare the end-user data security aspects of windows against linux.
that feature alone must account in large degree for the dearth of viruses and other malicious vermin on linux and unix platforms.

i started down this path by comparing how secure i am on a mac vs. on windows, then i compared mac vs. linux.
im more secure on linux than i am on windows.
i was constantly frustrated by the frequent reboots, lack of serious security capabilities (from my perspective), and such.
but, i still run a debian linux infrastructure for my company, with a couple samba servers at its core.
however, i consider myself very open-minded and will always give credit where its due.
i’m more secure on linux than i am on windows.
check out the new article, is linux really more secure than windows?, to see what the findings are ... you might be surprised (or not).
now its true that many linux users ignore these features and run all their software from a root-level account anyway, but thats a choice that theyve made.

and, i still use xp on another laptop from time to time, generally when a customer requires it or i absolutely must run something like activex controls on a web site.
but my point here is that linux does follow the security features and capabilities it inherited from unix quite closely.

qualitative score: windows gets a d+ while linux gets an a-.
it’s tough to be entirely fair here, since windows isn’t unix in any sense.
heck, some of my best friends use windows (but i do my best to talk them into os x anyway).
later, i started using windows-based systems at the office, but never felt quite at home.

windows, on the other hand, started life as a single user system, with that single user being all-powerful.
