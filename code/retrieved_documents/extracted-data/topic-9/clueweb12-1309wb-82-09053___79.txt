found a menu item to create user accounts.
we are addicted to windows.
like you said linux is completly diferent from windows.
however, most people aren’t power users.
could get to work straight up in there.
kanotix linux 2005-04 and pclinuxos or a “released” distribution such as novell’s suse linux 10.
and that is a lot of baseline knowlege.
rebooted, started again.
if it still doesn’t work, wait for the next upgrade.
i honestly do not ‘hate’ windows, but a windows install with all drivers, updates and apps required takes me at least some 4-5 hours.
how quaint… open office “write” initially looked like word.
presently i have kanotix linux 2005-04 installed on my wife’s t30 notebook and kubuntu “breezy” 5.10 linux on this p3 desktop i’m writing this on now.
i won’t try to tell you what you did wrong.
back to linux, because linux configuration is so flexible, it is wise to work with some experienced people (if you will… the equivalent of a oem winxp cd that has the appropriate drivers loaded for the bizarro brand new computer) when installing linux the first time.
got to the stage where i gave up and was logging in a root to  avoid this problem.
in this particular case, i did not.
if all you wanted was mysql, then install _nothing_ else.
but don’t be offended when we become frustrated by little things that seem to us to block our path.
there is a difference.
at one point, late the first day, i could see windows shares from nix, but  not the other way.
the only thing you did wrong was expect linux to be like windows.
i use windows xp at work, and linux on my 3 computers at home.
ibm supported both suse and red hat.
>>>now is where you tell me all that i did wrongâ€¦
consider giving it another shot with one of these distros.
yeah, i know you shouldn’t use root accounts  for general work.
but do you know anything about networks??
puppy is easy to use and is remarkably easy to run out of the box (so to speak).
but if you venture into server-admin stuff like mysql, it’s bound to be a lot more difficult, although in my experience setting up mysql was as easy as installing it and phpmyadmin
you are a brave soul…i’ll give you that.
i’m a windows bloke – so, naturally, i chose graphical.
i expected an os that was flexible, not tainted by security issues that cause widespread annoyance and “product activations”.
centos is redhat with _all_ the branding removed (a requirement dictated by the u.s. legal system.)
and unlike the old system & win inis, it seems to me that there are bazillions of those config files… and not all in the same place either.
the folks are usually very friendly and will gladly assist in helping with your first time linux install.
there are many more stable and more reliable systems out there for you to “evaluate” and the next time you decide to “evaluate”, please take the time to try a few “live cd’s” and find a nicer version for installation.
so lets all have a group-hug here.
as far as file sharing, and printer sharing, with ms windows.
a simple â€œdirâ€ in the shell doesnâ€™t work.
many unix folks intall the gnu tools to have their familiar unix commands available to them under windows.
thanks for allowing my commentary here.
dsl looks totally different but has firefox and puppy is just small and cute.
and that does not imply rebooting… if you give linux another try in the future consider using a desktop version of linux such as xandros or linspire.
your linux box could see the windows shares, but you’re windows box couldn’t see the linux shares?
i’m a civil engineer, i build bridge, buildings, etc, so time is of essence.
you seem to have approached the experiment with something of an open mind.
these write nothing to the hard drive yet give you a functional system to try.
remember, this from a person who has never seen or run linux before  spending all my time with various flavours of dos & windows.
i know its different, but why does everything have to be  different at the command prompt, but appear like windows in the gui?
suse is a complete linux os and is loaded with software.
there is a learning curve, and especially for a power user, it’s going to take time and effort to reach the same level of productivity.
i know windows is a shity piece of infested viruses, adware and malware, but if you limited yuor usage with care you could just about survive.
why do you think that unix, microsoft, and apple all have different end-of-line characters for their text files?
but this thread shows that the problem still exists, and it probably always will.
it’s not productive when your environments is windows.
the short of it is this.
if you ever want to try again, i think using kde would be more intuitive for a windows user.
(online download of iso vs. dialup?
that is because there are a lot of us.
it’s a free download [in this case unsupported] both for suse 10 demo and suse 10 open editions.
this is a lengthy linux setup, actually longer than most, but it has just about everything one needs for a workstation, desktop or server.
fedora is good, but more of a beast to tame.
fedora is ok for someone who knows linux and has used it before.
this has a direct impact on what i should focus on for marketable skills.
i have no idea what some of ‘em related  to… but what the heck.
they are just, plain, stupid.
expect to take a long time  before you’ll be productive.
this way, you wouldn’t have to spend too much time learning a completely new interface and you wouldn’t have to deal with unfamiliar territory.
that is why linux will ask for your proper identity if you want to change something that could be harmful to the system.
i cannot explain it – maybe, at that  time, like me, the pc had had enough.
fedora is based on redhat and redhat is a server based version, not a desktop version of linux.
seriously, get a copy of mepis or pclinuxos, and try using it for the things an average desktop user would need.
now to share it on the network.
so these observations which follow are of my first encounter with linux  (which occurred about a month ago – early dec).
firstly, i had armed myself with a couple of different books – a copy  of “fedora core 4 unleashed” and a “linux pocket book”,  both containing recent fedora core distributions.
the right thing to do is go to cheapbytes, or madtux, or somebody else and pay $5 or less to have them ship you a cd or dvd of the distro you desire.
both have a tendancy to foul up a computer.
loaded the dvd from the unleashed book into the drive and hit the reset button.
reminds me of my first foray into the linux world back in 1994.
i have usb flash drives, i can transfer files with them instead ;o) you might have found the printer easier if you’d been using kde tho – my gf’s printer worked out-of-the-box courtesy of kde’s setup, which was a relief as i’d had nightmares about her saying “what’s this cups thing then?”
pretty impressive, no?
a kde-loving friend of mine wanted to see how long it would be before he was forced to use the commmand line, and he found that he was able to do so for a long time.
if you require help, there is a wiki for both mepis and pclinuxos…in fact, pclinuxos has a link to it on your desktop when you install it.
after quite some time, a couple of dialogs, nominate root password and a *single* reboot (well, now, there is a plus)
there have been some attempts at creating gui administration tools for the many ini-like files.
http://www.zegeniestudios.net/ldc/index.php forgot to include the last site.
the rest of the complaints can be summarized as “it’s not windows, and i don’t know how to make it work the way windows did”.
that is why config files are text-based.
just reflect how long it took us to learn about dos and then windows?
my advice would be not to attempt these kind of projects if you want to test something out.
or would i rather decide for myself and try other things out?
now is where you tell me all  that i did wrong….
i’m very comfortable on the command line now, but i believe about a year ago i still had to look things up, and way before that i was using windows more just because i knew how and had homework to do.
two guesses as to which one was at fault.
and may i suggest, for next time, to try pclinuxos, opensuse 10, mepis.
also, the common denominator on a unix system is text.
every item in the books say launch this or that config file… (which, when finally found and opened, all, remarkably, look like “ini” files).
just remember, there are thousands of people who are trying and adopting linux as their new os every day.
just like windows, it is very easy to use once it is up and running.
this is a very wrong approach to take, and its no surprise you went running back to windows.
i know its different, but why does everything have to be different at the command prompt, but appear like windows in the gui?”
if i were to install something that i thought would be useful, it would be ubuntu.
now is where you tell me all that i did wrong….
interface, a text editor, when working with them.
often times, you will learn enough from just that one install to help with future installs.
these comments are longish – but contain just some of the many items i observed.
i like the command line, a lot.
why doesn’t a dvd/cd get auto recognised when you are  logged in at the command line?
you just already know windows and don’t know linux.
linux was born on the web…not surprisingly, google is one of your main weapons if you run into issues or need to look for documentation.
(ms windows boxes do sometimes seem to take up to 20 minutes to figure out additions to the network….)
i think some of these “it’s easy” comments may come from people who are familiar with nix but who have forgotten the various difficulties they first experienced.
hmmm… your experience looks about right, and i’m not chuckling.
and now that vista is coming out, there will probably be even more.
you can even run gui stuff from it (although that’s a more advanced topic requring you to do something like right click in the menus to find out what command is run to bring up the gui.)
and what’s with everything being configured by text files?
what frustrates us changovers is that these same problems are either easy to solve, or can not be solved in the windows environment.
i turned both pcs off and started again the next day –  only to fine that, without any further setting changes, windows could now see  ‘nix shared folder.
not because i want an easy change.
anyway created new user account, validated it on my win box, logged in to fedora with that..
(online download of iso vs.  dialup?
two parting comments: 1) after chewing up the better part of two full days (about 1 month ago), that particular nix pc has sat idle – i’m back to my comfortable and familiar windows world.
you don’t want an administrator to change something by accident, so you have to login as such to change system settings.
linux transgaming cedega was never stable, nfsu failed me always.
i’m using ubuntu now though, which really does work out of the box and easy (i can change the menu enties, nyer nyer!
the comments were written simply as a commentary on what i first experienced – and, to a degree, to refute those silly comments i sometimes hear which go along the lines “its *easy* to swap…”.
in yor case, your extended research would more than likely ended up with a “commercial linux” (support that can be purchased) such as red hat, mandriva or suse linux.
and whatâ€™s with everything being configured by text files?
you’d better had made a workstation installation and familiarize yourself with the system before trying something like a server install.
one thing at a time.
it would be lovely to see another article from you, to see whether the differences between linux(and in this case applications like ooffice etc), make it worth the move.
however there’s not much a way you could’ve known so now you that you do try http://www.mepis.org or http://www.pclinuxonline.com/pclos/index.html or http://www.lindows.com.
so one can easily configure a web server, database server, or file server.
mandriva is much easier to set up.
it does have the advantage of being first, so can point fingers and claim changing things for no reason.
on one side of the coin: i realize that the majority of the industry (office work stations) are using windows based machines.
combinations of needing new logins  created on a windows box, along with some funny settings (i’ll prolly  never find again) which match windows/sambo logins with local ids…  certainly it was not easy.
that everything is done using .ini
download a “live linux cd” and play with it.
firstly, i had armed myself with a couple of different books – a copy of “fedora core 4 unleashed” and a “linux pocket book”, both containing recent fedora core distributions.
other people don’t care one way or the other, then wonder why they can’t access their files anymore.
again, i’m not saying which is “better”.
in general the entire open source software movement is moving faster than any software paradigm ever had prior.
otherwise, i use a web browser, an email client, a media player, and an instant messenger, and everyone knows how to use those.
born in the 1990s with kde and gnome coming in at mid/later 1990s.
the rewards of using linux (or one of the bsds) are self empowerment.
my main desktop is a debian-based system, but the only thing that really confuses people is the desktop environment i use because there is no desktop.
(2) linux is about self-reliance, being open-minded, approaching problems in a logical manner and patience/persistance.
running everything in memory … you’re safe from viruses and malware.
you have to right-click to bring up the application menu.
though i only used older pcs to play with it on.
i turned both pcs off and started again the next day – only to fine that, without any further setting changes, windows could now see ‘nix shared folder.
at the same time, if you sit down a completely new computer user in front of a computer and tell him/her “go ahead and install windows”, you will see the same frustrations.
/etc/hosts, /etc/hosts.allow, /etc/hosts.deny, /etc/resolv.conf, etc.
i couldn’t find a way to get the thing to auto-log  in.
several attempts with different (why would you have several seperate ways  to hook up a printer??
you know the drill on microsoft systems: is something doesn’t work, reboot.
why have all the headache learning new db?
linux is not windows, and it’s not meant to be.
expect to take a long time before you’ll be productive.
if it still doesn’t work, reinstall.
we also go into the senior assisted living centers where our elders reside.
now is where you tell me all that i did wrong.
(1) you’re trying to carry your windows behaviour/skills to linux.
i become good at managing partition, windows system, a bit of reg editor and i’m a bit fan of backup software (because system is always corrupted) particularly acronis true image.
then i have the os installed, all apps (open office, gimp, apache, all drivers, lots of multi media stuff, browsers, plugins, mail client, editors, the whole schebang), and am ready to go….
well you get the idea.
if they get around to it.
made a user account –
maybe they’ll actually listen to you one day.
i want to learn and fortunately am making time to learn.
well, other than going with fedora, not much.
this is the big reason i avoid the gui, i only ever have to learn the text config _once_.
to make it sure that _you_ are given the hard time you had.
maybe you should try ubuntu.
regards to all dave i do understand what you are going through because as a native windows user or native microsoft product user since dos, new os scares me off.
i supposed everything is in gui?
well, i am not so sure.
however, i don’t use windows at home.
i hope you take the time to research other distros and pick another and give this a go again!
it used a mysql database with a secure (https) web based interface available to any machine.
that is not my point.
for my personal use,, .i prefer the totally non-commercial debian based linux distributions.
and a bunch of other things.
(gnome desktop by default, although i believe kde was also available – i certainly didn’t know enough to feel the need to alter their default choice).
the lack of viruses and malware makes the maintenance of my home systems incredibly easy.
i cannot explain it – maybe, at that time, like me, the pc had had enough.
the most popular would be the knoppix distro.
good luck, and hopefully you’ll try again.
as far as text configuration files go, consider this: you get to leave _comments_ in them.
i never bothered to get samba working after trying it a few times.
it’s a confusing free-form hap-hazzard world on the internet and many “linux documentation or help sites” are just outdated.
the disgusting “windows sickness” has indeed affected you, and microsoft is counting on that.
but what are the logistics of doing so.
anyway, i finally got writer (openoffice)  to send a formatted line of text to my windows printer.. although i did not  understand, nor bother, about the cryptic error in the dialog i received after  the print had been generated.
probably what you did wrong is use the wrong version of the wrong distribution.
all i’m trying to say is that there is a *considerable* learning curve to the change.
shoulda looked closer before leaping.
check out this link: http://www.zegeniestudios.net/ldc/ i use mepis (www.mepis.org), a very friendly and easy to install distro.
i just happen to like mepis better, but that doesn’t mean you have to of course….
note that some of these facilities will creep into vista for the simple reason that they are more secure that your comfortable windows.
it takes a lot of effort, learnig, and commitment to be able to make the change.
or am i willing to learn a completely different way of doing things.
you either can or can’t.
i went back to windoze even though i still hated it…
could get to  work straight up in there.
if you want to run the latest, stable, redhat release, run centos.
i know its different, but why does everything have to be different at the command prompt, but appear like windows in the gui?
and yes, as you’ve been told, there are much easier distros to use, some which would really appeal to a windows user (i won’t bore you with a recitation, though).
my girlfriend once had to use the computer to check her email, and i was about to walk away when she asked how to access it.
printer controls are a perfect example.
if you want to learn something very  different – then by all means, try linux (or unix or freebsd or…).
wireless connectivity is problematic, but ethernet largely “just works”.
if you want to lean something very different – then by all means, try linux (or unix or freedsb or…).”, and also: “after all that,
several attempts with different (why would you have several seperate ways to hook up a printer??
its like trying to encourage a muslim to adopt another religion!
next time, focus on your goal.
windows was primarily conceived as a single user work station type os.
http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/lnw.htm is an article that explains everything more correctly.
i have taken many hours to figure out how to get a given site in iis working correctly when i could get the same task done in minutes using apache.
i have tried to make the leap several times.
explaining_ your settings, and _why_ you made the choices you did.
which has more opportunity for new and emerging skill set needs?
it’s to make it _hard_ to switch between them.
fedora is not really a newbie oriented distribution.
one last server in particular i built for the company was a “network server monitoring box” using the open source package “zabbix” on suse linux.
but: i’d never burned a disk in my life.
helios i’m not going to tell you what you did wrong…enough other people are going to feel like it’s their linux duty to do that.
i, like many of the responders have been working with computers since the dos days(before windows).
that’s not the best linux has to offer i’ll tell you right now.
if anything, perhaps expectations were a bit high?
as a result, linux is nowhere as easy to use as windows.
subsequently my  fears that this might cause problems were proved founded!
i know you can use linux commands to do these simple tasks and a lot more than that.
even i who had had significant dos, unix and windows knowledge took two years to implement a full workstation with all frills attached (including windows programs and os compatibility).
some of the comments received seem to indicate that the readers may not have noticed i wrote these lines - “summary: you want to “get to work” straight away?
and i agree, when i first learn windows it’s a very complicated affair for me.
like version numbers.)
yeah, i’d have a similar bunch of comments if i was an old unix user trying windows for the first time.”
which would be easier for learning additional skills?
nonetheless, it is true….
the linux / unix shells are so powerful, that you, after you got used to it, will miss it a lot when you’re forced to use windows.
they are offered for general interest and likely amusement of the ‘nix aware among you.
i think some of these “it’s  easy” comments may come from people who are familiar with nix but who  have forgotten the various difficulties they first experienced.
then stick with what you know.
the box keeps running and running going on two years now.]
but once i figure d everything out it was my routine.
i worked in my employer’s it department for three years and have set up both linux and windows servers and i have about 18 – 20 years of experience with computers overall.
but think about this in another view… windows was brought into the world in 1985.
for example, we don’t need to knew how to use the grep command to find a file anymore.
the linux installer fired up & gave text or graphical installer options.
(gnome desktop by default,  although i believe kde was also available – i certainly didn’t know  enough to feel the need to alter their default choice).
no i’m not surprised nix was different to windows – i would have been amazed otherwise.
if you’re not open minded, then linux or any other os will not work for you.
you should expect to google for a answers to questions, and if my learning experience years ago is any indication, you should expect to get frustrated by not knowing what the right question to ask is.
that why you have to mount and unmount.
i started on mainframes, then moved to novell and windows administration on the pc.
i feel that this evolution if it continues will bring more of us over to the linux world.
the linux experience is not as monolithic as the experience with windows xp.
it shouldn’t be easy.
bloody obvious, isn’t it?
answers to questions asked can be a good thing.
etc… most people don’t know what a pain it is to install windows (using a from microsoft cd, not the oem one that may or may not have come with the box).
after that, it was easy.
i mean windows got one 300000 lines config called regedit, and thats sucks.
then install kde instead of gnome (because it is less strange for those that are accustomed to windows) and take your time playing around with it, finding the applications you want and first-and-formost look for sources of documentation (http://www.tldp.org/ for example) and connect yourself to the novell suse newsgroups and start asking questions.
changing from windows to any other os is painful for a reason.
i wanted to feel that i was in control of my own computer, not some distant corporation.
ton’s o’ gui tools to make this (mostly) unnecessary… i could go on, but the truth is linux is not windows (in spite of some misguided efforts to make it that way).
it fits in with how i think, i guess.
why did you bother the openoffice too?
these are the ones newbies should try.
it’s the most documented because people love red hat and fedora is their baby.
ok… you are very correct in that buying a pc with windows preinstalled is considerably different from doing a from scratch install of any version of linux/bsd/whatever.
of course, distros are a lot more friendly now (believe it or not).
nowadays (to the horror of oldtimers like me) there are facilities to “autologin” and “automount”.
windows  clearly displays my different drive volumes –
i’m just saying that there is a lot of learning involved with a change as significant as a new os.
i believe that you didn’t give linux as a whole a fair shake by using the most experimental version of linux on the market.
linux assumes that if you want the cd mounted, you’ll tell it.
you seemed to run into all sorts of problems of the sort that have become really rare.
ya think i could find someway to turn off the high level of security?
my point is that humans are inflexible.
its like saying the adult is better because its easier to talk to than the toddler!
a good guide can help make the time you spend much more effective.
yes, setting up networking, samba, and networked printing is difficult, and not as well documented as you might like.
they got also excelent documentation available, left and right.
for various tasks and forgetting that i’ve been audibly frustrated when learning how to do those same tasks.
this is a bad approach.)
lobby4linux runs several “labs” for after school kids.
are you really telling me that you did that in two days?
my suggestion for the totally inexperienced is to start with one of the “live cd’s” on th emarket today either free of charge as a download or easily ordered over the internet.
we still use windows xp here at home but very cautiously.
we did our homework and the install and configuration went smoothly.
you have used windows for years .
you confuse “being hard to use” with “having difficulty unlearning”.
(plus they are easily manipulated by simple programs.)
you did some quite advanced things(home networking, databases, and seemed to come out a winner.
my t30 notebook i “dual boot” both win xp and simply mepis linux.
you seem to be forgetting that you are not the “average user”.
i couldn’t find a way to get the thing to auto-log in.
but don’t expect you can do anything like you did in windows.
i knew that i need to set certain ip settings to  what values, but ya think i could easily find where?
so, you nix people, go on, have your chuckle.
true, network maintenance can be hard, because there are so many subsystems.
think that you used the wrong distribution – fedora core is an experimental distribution to test future technologies that will be included in forthcoming redhat commercial products.
these are for newbies who want to spend minimal effort to get going.
i can’t find much to diagree with.
printed publications just can’t keep up with it so intensive (on the internet) research is a must before doing any serious linux project if you are new to linux.
i am sorry to say that your blog shows nothing more than your ignorance about foss in general and linux in particular.
dir does work with most distributions i’ve used (it’s aliased to ls, which is the equivilant linux command).
i better do not start with what does not work in the windows “shell” the linux one really is superior to it!
the command line can be used just like dos for most of the basics(and you could have got a 5 line cheat sheet of equivalents) after a while you may be surprised by what you you can use the command line for.
most unix commands are aimed at a specific task, and the usage of “|” and “>” helps link the commands together to do more complex things.
at least one i know was referred to as  “cups”) setup tools, i finally found i had to blindly enter the  mappings to the location of the pc/printer name, ‘cos nix would not show  the printer even existed until after the password access to the printer had  been validated.
with all your “whatever” and “oh well” comments, and your poor use of spell checker and grammatical review, you don’t deserve an operating system that actually works.
ditto for whatever the excel replacement was  (calc?).
here it comes: linux (like all unixes) was constructed as a multi user system.
and in some ways it shows in each new release of their products and services.
its had over 20yrs of maturing.
i don’t think you obtained your windows knowledge overnight.
basically, i see two capital errors: 1.
i wouldn’t want to elicit more questions from someone with a clear lack of any ability to think for themselves.
a simple “dir” in the shell  doesn’t work.
now at home my pc is dual boot, but most of the time i am using linux.
linux has the same potential for gaming as long as distro are as good and easy for windows convert (read windows converts not newbies) to try them and this will result in developers recognising potential in linux therefore break the evil monopoly of non-standard coder in microsoft products.
as the bloke who made the original post which started this (with thanks to daniel for transcribing and loading the file), i find the comments received from all to be most interesting, some expected, some not.
(its “ls” in linux btw).
it will, i hope, give you a different expirience.
compare their ages on the desktop.
ubuntu would have been a better choice than fedora.
no where in its original goal was there mention for it to be “easy to use”.
man that’s was funny reading – a shame that you didn’t read the books before you tried linux.
all of these can be installed also if one wants to and all offer good hardware support and a base selection of applications to try.
1) you took the self-guided tour.
if you want to learn something very different – then by all means, try linux (or unix or freebsd or…).
never thought it would be that simple!
and you call yourself a “geek” ?
and what frustrates us newbee’s more is that we are too ignorant to know how to find out what we need to do to solve these problems.
this was to be used to test on a local controlled private network.
which would be more transferable in the event that i need to change jobs?
this is a joke, right?
of what the new terminology was? then to printers….
on all my three machines theres is linux laptop, server and desktop and neither the time or the bravery to run the crappy microsoft os.
you actually looked like you found a weekend project that didn’t fit the bill.
you seem to have be doing fine and happy with windows, may be you should stick to it.
the linux installer fired up & gave text or graphical installer  options.
if config settings weren’t in text files, you wouldn’t be able to leverage the very tools that make unix what it is.
to really compare a linux distribution with ms windows, try the paid versions of mandriva or suse, which come with a full manual and much better configuration tools.
or mii-tools for networking… let me install windows, i’ll write the same report vice versa.
it depends on what you do with it too.
it is a service on its own and does its own user validation.
unix is no better or worse than the rest, having been raised to maturity in the proprietary world along with the rest of them.
i’d expect to need a bunch of time to get used to their  idea of an interface.
though installed apps put themselves in there anyway).
i s’pose  you’d get use to the “mount point” system… but i like  my drive letters.
finally get to the “ok, now install it  all” & waited….
root password requests?
and may i recommend kde instead of gnome?
there is normally no in-between there.
let’s leave you and the rest of the windoze freaks where you belong.
then, after checking minimum hardware requirements in the books, i threw  together a basic “no frills” pc running what appeared to be more  than adequate – p3 600, 3/4 gig ram, 40 gig hdd, basic lan card, old dvd  reader, old tnt video, no floppy, no sound, no extras.
it would  never see internet or unknown source disks and so would not be at risk from  foreign nasties.
i say may be you shouldn’t bother and stick with mssql express.
how quaintâ€¦ the more newbie friendly distro’s will have an automount utility running which will mount your cd’s and floppies for you.
if you are happy with it, no prob.
printers magically work, browse your network neighborhood just like in windows, plug in your ipod and bewm it works!
1)root 2)ini files 3)command line microsoft is implementing real root, ini files(in the form of xml), and a whole new command line interface.
*** linux …it’s totally different, similar to unix, bsd but requires research and , depending on your skills, some time to get comfortable with it.
all that you did wrong?
how to remove software if someone remove it improperly, hey clicking on add remove wouldn’t do any good so again reg editor.
most of what you wanted to do is easily done, but you do need to take the time to learn it, ‘cuz it ain’t the same… but the rewards are really great when you do.
closing comments: fedora is a constant “work in progress”in which red hat supports but it lacks the “final finish” that a true “released” linux distribution would have.
every time i tried to do anything i was prompted for the  root password.
so you come running back and be forever relying on them!
loaded the dvd from the unleashed book into the drive and hit the reset  button.
i installed linux, fired up the gui for burning a cd, chose the burner and reader and copied my first disk.
or your first venture into ansi prompt commands?
i think kunbutu as its flavour of the month)/kde install not because of particular benefit, but your probably in an ideal position to compare the two.
to do so, you don’t even have to have a gui installed, much less running.
they want to be first out the door with the new major number, and so seem to me more likely than most to ship early versions.
pick something that’s not experimental.
but learning linux to me should be more or less the same as learning windows except for linux installation was way easier particularly in pclos.
you wanted this machine to run as a database server.
you known exactly what your pc is doing and can make it do what you want and make it into a tool that fits your needs.
now to share it on the  network.
if you’re happy in windows, by all means, stay in windows.
at one point, late the first day, i could see windows shares from nix, but not the other way.
they are offered for  general interest and likely amusement of the ‘nix aware among you.
i set everything at auto, system on 24/7 backup will start on certain date.
with some study, i’m sure suse linux would have worked for you.
you can access it over the network from your microsoft machines as a client.
i personally then use the home sites of these distrubtions, their own supported forums and spin off forums to get the info i need.
do i really want to pay these companies their high asking price?
i can deal with that.
i know its different, but why does everything have to be different at the command prompt… unix predated dos; why can’t the question be reversed.
i know many, if not most will want and need a *secure* pc to protect from nasties.
and yes, automounting of detected drives or network shares is commonly used, now.
[ in the corporate environment i used suse linux since we needed an addtional lotus domino server.
windows is not as intuitive as some claim, although i’ve always thought that the complaint “why do you have to click on start to shutdown?”
linux was designed to be an affordable clone to unix.
hello just to say i saw our home network the minute i first booted in clean install.
for example, my wife tried various distributions of linux for the first time last year and she only found 2 that she could use…mepis (www.mepis.com) and pclinuxos (www.pclinuxonline.com/pclos) go get em, try again, then let us know how it worked out.
the mysql test  install which prompted al this?
anyway, i am off windows for nearly 2 years now, and not going back.
all i know is just using word and excell at work.
puppy and dsl will both fir on a mini-cd (210mb) disc with room to spare.
summary: you want to “get to work” straight  away?
thick skin flame retardant suit more thick skin i am not going to flame you…you reported what you found, and you hit on the answer…you simply fail to give it any credence.
it is packed full of many different applications and using the kde desktop, looks and acts kinda like windows.
yast (the graphical configuration tool) is easy to use.
since winxp can only see driver loads via floppy at install time (won’t handle drivers burnt to a cd), if your pc is a “legacy free” cd, you’re trapped!!
this is invaulable in the long run.
but because i want to make the change and i am willing to make the investment in time and effort.
i’m not  saying it can’t be changed… it’s prolly in a config file  somewhere!
they just get in my way!
i’m not saying it can’t be changed… it’s prolly in a config file somewhere!
it’s always good to at least be familiar with more than just a limited subset of the computing universe.
it is a client-server database.
i got serious about linux in 2000.
it costs you only the time to learn.
really two different perspectives.
and you get to use _one_
after this little adventure, i then hear that this, that or the other flavour of nix would have been better because….
even beyond the metafore, it is good advice.
in the old days, years before linux, i knew machines that accommodated 50, 100 and more users.
and you’re ready to go.
and the text file of today is the text file of yesterday.
and if we can be accomodated, you will find a huge surge of userbases and financing coming your way because of us.
and i never managed to unbar the ports that mysql used so i could get to it  from a windows box.
let me try to illustrate with a story from my own past.
windows and linux are different, and not as in ‘one is more difficult than the other’, but you already stated that.
2 last points 1) *ix is not win and you should expect things to be drastically diff.
and speaking of security….
you’re summary is largely correct.
any way, just in case you decide to come back to give linux a second try, take my advice (i have been using linux for 6 years) and try other distributions.
all by just booting from a cd, clicking ‘install me’, answering some easy questions and letting it run….
however, on the other side of the equation: we have an industry that is primarily being directed by the whims of one huge money hungry company.
you don’t need samba to make mysql run.
they make it “expensive” in this sense, to leave microsoft solutions!
and  unlike the old system & win inis, it seems to me that there are bazillions  of those config files… and not all in the same place either.
same with ubuntu…tis good for someone who knows linux.
i do appreciate, though, that you are blindly condemning linux.
you see, foss is about choice and there are many choices available for you.
you don’t have that choice in windows, your dependent on microsoft to make that choice for you.
i do have two points.
i’m not trying to say that nix doesn’t have advantages or that windows is better.
was it an easy switch?
ever since, she’s technically been a linux user whenever she came over to my place.
a few years ago i did the same as you – which was a big mistake!
pclinuxos is linux the way linux should be.
as noted, you know windows but don’t know linux.
it’s a rock-solid distro, but it’s really geared to the experienced ‘nix/linux user.
if you want to break free from it, you must “empty your cup”.
why doesn’t a dvd/cd get auto recognised when you are logged in at the command line?
with this information i would not think of grep or another linux command.
you’ve sort of shown that, but you seen not wanting to change your behaviour and expect it to “be like windows”.
anyway, i finally got writer (openoffice) to send a formatted line of text to my windows printer.. although i did not understand, nor bother, about the cryptic error in the dialog i received after the print had been generated.
i’ hope only out of interests sake you go for debian(whatever
how long did you take before you were able to use/install/hack/fiddle windows or dos?
every time i tried to do anything i was prompted for the root password.
but really the proprietary unix vendors killed themselves off by playing the same game.
you installed without checking for the correct linux distribution.
however, have you done an winxp cd install on a piece of new hardware before?
(you might also want to install the ssh server so you can use putty from your microsoft machines to administer the box, and perhaps phpmyadmin so the box has a web interface into the database.)
we can use a gui file manager with a search command.
this is very telling.
i can send you a copy of either or both if need be, just email your snail mail address.
no one else in the shop seemed ot be able to get anything in the way of administration done on them, even those with basic training.
of what the new  terminology was? then to printers….
i depend on it, in fact.
you wanted a linux-based machine up and running quickly?
i would think of using a search.
wish there was more of that… peace.
well, frig me, if it didn’t take at  least 4 – 5 hours arsing around before i could even get the thing to see  my windows network, let along get it to be able to transfer files back &  fwd.
if you want to stay ignorant, it is your choice.
i have to be…my jobs always depend on it.
then again, if you don’t really feel like leaving windows, why would you bother??
of course there is a learning curve, because the system is different.
i’d suggest a nice forum, or chat room; people fall over themselves to help because most will have experienced similar problems.
just like windows, if you’ve never installed it before, you might get thrown off when the installation program asks for certain settings.
imagine dialogs with about 18-20 tabs each, with multiple checkbox, buttons launching additional dialogs and so on.
now didn’t windows move on from config by ini files about a decade ago?
and please note that a reboot on windows made certain things work.
i also appreciate that more and more hardware is being recognized and less headaches are being found when trying to make the switch.
i mostly agree but … there are some very easy to use linuxes on live cds that could be installed locally.
still, i wanted to learn how to use gnu/linux because i didn’t want to be stuck using windows xp with its crappy activation, eula, and digital restrictions management, so i persevered.
from a shell (what, coloured background  by default… ummm different) established that mysql had loaded, and from  mysql docos got the server process running.
at some point, i got drafted into also supporting macs, despite having no training on them.
following the comments posted in various forums which espouse the various benefits of linux and having a need to test a setup of “mysql” database engine, i though, well, lets give this ‘nix thing a go.
the documentation is excellent either from novell in *.pdf format from their website or the printed manuals if one buys the boxed version.
(people say knoppix and ubuntu have a reputation for working on all sorts of hardware.)
ubuntu is extremely popular with the “coming from windows” crowd.
now that’s frustration.
i dropped down a windows version, installed it  to a xp “server” box, and was up and running remotely from my  windows desktop creating tables and queries *within an hour*.
if you leave a root terminal window open, then you don’t have to constantly enter a password.
i can still “mount” a local drive to save something if needed.
only in recent years, did the linux community notice the “desktop user crowd”.
so these observations which follow are of my first encounter with linux (which occurred about a month ago – early dec).
i s’pose you’d get use to the “mount point” system… but i like my drive letters.
i’ve been on linux for about four years, completely for the last two or so.
but hey, congratulations on reaching the correct, “it’s not what i’m used to so i’d need time to learn about it” conclusion instead of the all-too-common “it’s not what i’m used to so it sucks” conclusion )
few need to use the command line on windows, and neither on a linux distro.
i’m sure you will get a stack of advise, on you could have installed this or used that now, but next time
no telling, but you probably compounded the problem by using something that came from the print publishing industry.
it seems offbeat to us to not cut and past a file, but simply chane the pathname of the file.
i know many, if not most will want and need a *secure* pc to  protect from nasties.
which of course means that there are a number of specific commands to learn, but you shouldn’t ever feel that you need to learn all of them.
linux/foss rescued them.
in my view, neither of us are wrong here.
its considered a young adult now.
i use them traveling exclsively to hook up to wifi hotspots.
you’re not using linux to check your email.
all i had to do was first realize that it wasn’t windows.
i also use multiple workspaces/desktops.
lots of open source software runs on windows as well….
its a toddler on the desktop front…10yrs old.
there are “easy to use” distros like ubuntu, pclinuxos, fox desktop linux, mepis, xandros, etc.
can’t see the disk, can’t see the ethernet, can’t see the usb, can’t see the firewire, can’t see the sound….
serial terminals don’t know “autologin”: you have to identify yourself.
that said, i do have some comments.
i recommend working with a linux user group in your area.
the same is, unfortuantely, true on windows.
it is an *alternative* operating system, just like amigaos or beos.
it will make any learning curve less painful, and maybe a little fun happy computing
it was designed by a computer science student!
ms finally realized that they needed something like that.
one more reason why i prefer windows is because the bill gates had manage to fork out the best game developer in this planet to work for them.
i put my hands on one of these some time ago, it was supposed to be something like a control panel developed in-house, able to control some aspects, including typical system configuration, web server configuration (apache), samba configuration and some others.
you don’t suppose when the wrote dos they _knew_ that unix used ‘ls’ instead of ‘dir’?
it is also free and plays on your familiar turf.
instead of being surprised at differences, you should actually be surprised with commonalities.
(3) you don’t understand the fundamentals before you dived in.
hans bezemer i would never ever recommend fedora to a beginner, totally unfamiliar with linux/unix.
- first and primary point: true:
but linux is not for everyone.
last year read about knoppix in pcmag online, downloaded it,tried it and since then i like linux a lot.
after quite some time, a couple of dialogs, nominate root password and a  *single* reboot (well, now, there is a plus)
this was to alert us of memory problems, disk probems, bandwidth etc.
the one thing that you did wrong was use fedora.
it would never see internet or unknown source disks and so would not be at risk from foreign nasties.
i dropped down a windows version, installed it to a xp “server” box, and was up and running remotely from my windows desktop creating tables and queries *within an hour*.
but back on target… why would i want to make the change after all of that?
a windows user’s adventures in linux filed under: linux — guest @ 19:31
it was quick to configure, and having my linux experiences, i had an easier time doing what configurations i wanted.
i liked it that you’ve taken bother in reading some documentation (text in this case), you’re “one up” on most people in this sense.
subsequently my fears that this might cause problems were proved founded!
- second point: linux is advancing fast..almost too fast for most of us!
ms office should be just fine for you.
files is still an advantage.
i am sure you spent an awful lot of time learning windows but very un-willing to take a little of time to get familiar with linux.
got to the stage where i gave up and was logging in a root to avoid this problem.
we just want to take a specific set of goals and find a linux way of accomplishing them.
each time i did, i found good and bad things about linux.
i got by for a year or so without learning how to use tar, and it wasn’t until i worked in a company that uses unix/linux-based systems that i started to learn intermediate-level bash commands.
my boss later asked me how i was able to fix macs that i knew nothing about when.
name mail (will not be published)
a simple “dir” in the shell doesn’t work.
i appreciate that more linux distributions are becoming more gui in nature.
each time i found stumbling blocks.
but whenever you get into another operating system, expect differences.
people who work professionally with ms or who do it all the time seem to have no problem.
(you’re expecting another os to mold and suit your windows needs!
one of the biggest problems was that the prevailing temperment of the folks that i would have liked to get help from was abrasive at best.
anyway created new user account, validated it on my win box, logged in to  fedora with that..
use an early version of fedora within the major numbering scheme, and well, you’ve decided to be a lab rat.
although i suggest a new hard drive and put it on your main machine so you get the full benefit.
winxp won’t even install because you have no way of getting a floppy onto the system (apart from putting a floppy into the system from somewhere) to get the driver load so the new chipset and ide and/or sata interfaces can be seen.
i did tried linux but the learning curve was to expensive particularly to get complicated things done like telling a legacy device to work.
have a pleasant tommorow, bub what a nice read .
seems like you wanted windows and installed linux.
combinations of needing new logins created on a windows box, along with some funny settings (i’ll prolly never find again) which match windows/sambo logins with local ids… certainly it was not easy.
i’m not trying to say  that nix doesn’t have advantages or that windows is better.
further, installing more apps from the disk using the gui installer changed nothing in that menu.
and there just aren’t any easy and painless ways for us to quit.
however, for those that don’t know it…other distros work better.
ya think i could find someway to turn off the high level of  security?
the fact that every windows user is almost automatically “administrator” has caused enough trouble already, like spyware, virusses, etc.
(as usual when responding to bug reports, somebody’d know more if you gave us details.
plus there were instructions in those books)
here’s my summary of the main issues you’re facing.
so now i come to a point where i do want to make the change.
the mysql test install which prompted al this?
yeah, i know you shouldn’t use root accounts for general work.
you see, it’s quite unfortunate that many people new to linux actually think linux is just like windows, only without the problems.
thanks for some insight into how the other 90% lives.
i told him it was simple.
and keep in mind that services need to be restarted if you modify their settings.
later i took two red hat classes knowing my employer could benefit from not only using linux but having somebody trained on board.
in some ways it is like quitting smoking.
its not about just using linux, its about changing your own behaviour as well.
as to why everything has to be different, well, it’s because microsoft _wants_ everything to be different.
if the gui isn’t installed, those text files are the only configuration options you’re going to have.
i believe that gnome resembles mac os more, which has the apple button at the top left.
there’s just an entirely different philosophy in how things function and why — and in most instances it just “feels right” for me.
“is the external drive broken or the usb hub?”
what comes to mind is that you seem to attribute to linux what you should attribute to yourself.
now all of these thoughts direct me towards where i want to focus my efforts for a career.
let’s get some things together for you…let’s see, ok, here we go.
these  comments are longish – but contain just some of the many items i observed.
i was up and running in no time..
gentoo has great forums, and freenode has irc channels for debian.
not just because kde is better than gnome, but mainly because it is a lot similar to windows gui.
after this little adventure, i then hear that this, that or the other  flavour of nix would have been better because….
remember your first system.ini edit?
if you wanted a mainstream distribution, you’d probably have been better off with mandriva or some such, or even better yet mepis or pclinuxos, both of which are aimed at desktop use.
there are hundreds of distributions (linux oses), some great, some not so great.
as far down to as “tweaking” the kernel, making mods to source code, building your own distro, firewall, dedicated router or just installing a home system for grandma.
thanks for wasting my time.
for you to accept something new…you, yourself must change.
i’m so sorry that i have spent all these years on windows, but because i know how it work i could get my job done.
we use pclinuxos and within 3 hours (database experimentations excluded) they are up and running with little or no fuss.
if you’re not willing to accept how things are done in a certain way, then you won’t be successful in your journey.
the machine is normal again.
remember, this from a person who has never seen or run linux before spending all my time with various flavours of dos & windows.
.. till the installer crashed prior to the disk partitioning step.
you’re using firefox.”
for most people, the desktop functionality is largely equivilant.
not saying that it hasn’t his share of problems/difficultied,especially the 2006 version.
hehe “a simple â€œdirâ€ in the shell doesnâ€™t work”
unix is different from windows.
but do not believe what you may have heard that “it is easy” or  “you will be up and running quickly”.
there are distributions who let you work as root all the time.
oh well, your mileage may vary, and if windows makes you happy, by all means use it.
but again, this is a difference in philosophy.
you can comment on a certain setting, you can comment out certain settings.
i am not sure what were your objects, but you said you are interested in mysql.
another would have been puppylinux and dsl2.0.
which has more learning tools and resources?
every item  in the books say launch this or that config file… (which, when finally  found and opened, all, remarkably, look like “ini” files).
this is what microsoft wants you to feel!
ubuntu can be ordered on the internet and comes with a “live cd” to try without installing and a seperate “install” cd.
haven’t had problems with samba recently, for example.
i will agree that you probably tried a distro that may not have been the best fit for your current knowledge of linux in general.
but mandriva or suse are no different in that respect in my experience.
and i never managed to unbar the ports that mysql used so i could get to it from a windows box.
i never used that, i preffered to stick to editing files.
what the hell are they?
mepis will: - have samba set up and working for you - let you create user accounts on the fly - let you install mysql and phpmyadmin all from the gui, and ready to run - come with a pre configured firewall - come with loads of apps already installed - … and lots more oh, and: - offer you a very friendly community to help you out with things that may arise as you go i’m not kidding: on a pc with a partition available, i will install mepis, and mysql from scratch in about 30 minutes!
all that is required is an internet connection, since we need to install mysql from the online repositories.
spent some time accepting defaults for the disk partitioning and making various  choices about what to install.
i never expect it to be “easy” or “getting up and running quickly”.
command line is not as required as you state, there are lots of gui’s to accomplish things but text books tend to be overly geeky and over emphasise their use.
red hat has all of it’s source code available for download but does not offer free downloads of it’s completed linux oses.
pretty soon you will be left behind and that would be a consequence of your own decision.
iam pleased that this article was not as flamewar than others are.
well, frig me, if it didn’t take at least 4 – 5 hours arsing around before i could even get the thing to see my windows network, let along get it to be able to transfer files back & fwd.
i’d recommend suse linux.
i have tried mepis, fedora, kanotix, puppy, arabian, slax, pclinuxos, xandros,ubuntu, suse, mandriva e.t.c.
then, no need to mess with firewalls and all that.
following the comments posted in various forums which espouse the various  benefits of linux and having a need to test a setup of “mysql”  database engine, i though, well, lets give this ‘nix thing a go.
this time selected text mode installer.
now  didn’t windows move on from config by ini files about a decade ago?
i want you all to understand.
i’d recommend mepis linux, kanotix linux, or pclinuxos.
i feel the same way about windows — why can’t a simple “ls” work?
the interface is consistent over time, unlike guis where there’s good reasons to rearrange things constantly or to have them vary from vendor to vendor.
each distro of linux provides the configuration and setup utilities and the glue to hold it all together.
did not think so either.
if all you do is browsing, email, and office apps, then firefox, evolution or kmail, and open office are readily usable; and setting up an attached printer is fairly easy with cups.
forever after i’ll be able to use it on about any version of unix until the end of time.
a lot of us believe we’d rather have the choice than to trust that wesayso industries will always meet our needs.
bloody hell, i wanna share with my win network, but it would not let me create a login that matched what is already in use on the win network – i currently use, my logins have a space in ‘em… like “dave jenkins” nix didn’t like that.
so you are right in that there is a considerably learning curve for a windows user, but i imagine that it would be the same vice versa.
you know for sure that it will only impact on the application you’re using: not your whole system.
further, installing more apps from  the disk using the gui installer changed nothing in that menu.
it’s great to hear that someone as stupid as you has problems getting linux running.
whats odd about this article is your article criticizes linux mainly for not being everything windows is bad at and indeed microsoft is spending serious money trying to correct.
i’ve been guilty of saying, “it’s easy!”
this has changed recently with new forums and clubs that people can join to get help.
the thing about out config file is dumb.
gnome desktop – i could find no way to alter what  items appeared in their applications menu.
this is largely confirmed by the fact that rebooting solved the problem.
everything else flowed from that flawed assumption.
i can’t offer much help with either, as i use slackware, but i have the iso’s for both.
you remind me of the person that takes an interest in racing and buys or acquires a formula 1 racer and complains that there’s no a/c and it rides rough.
bloody hell, i wanna share with my win network, but it would  not let me create a login that matched what is already in use on the win  network – i currently use, my logins have a space in ‘em…  like “dave jenkins” nix didn’t like that.
did you consider logging in as root to do administrative tasks?
in 2003-2004 i took the plunge and installed linux (as the only os) on one of my “newer” home desktops, mepis linux.
hardly ever touch one!
my first experience with unix was installing a solaris-based webserver, which was actually even more unfriendly than fedora (graphical install?
another dave looking at your article in the overall sense, you’re trying to put your windows behaviour/skills onto linux.
plus, you picked a fscked up distro like fedora (can’t waith for the fedora people to flame me now, muhaha).
it might save you money on anti virus/spyware/adware/ and time installing and servicing them!
with suse linux, i found more information about it from ibm and researching all of the various forums.
so try and listen to the comments and use another friendly distro, like pclinuxos or (k)ubuntu… go for it…!
you don’t want normal users turning off security features.
i knew that i need to set certain ip settings to what values, but ya think i could easily find where?
but i also am fully committed to doing just that.
two guesses as to which server will run better, the one with or the one without a gui running? >
happy linuxing… devnet dave, your are either not ready for linux or linux is not for you.
but 10.1 is rock stable and if you need help, people have a lot of experience with 10.1
we’re all just so used to it that we’ve forgotten when we deleted things without uninstalling first or when we didn’t know you were supposed to shutdown the machine before turning it off.
“i don’t know anything about linux!”
after all these comments, for my desktop system i use pclos and it’s a great for windows convert to feel at home right away.
which is undeniably true.
do i care about what the industry is sticking in my face?
well, first of all you make the basic error if considering windows normal.
on both windows and linux server boxes in that domain.
consider reading this first…1.6mb download introduction to linux – a hands on guide http://tldp.org/ldp/intro-linux/intro-linux.pdf (4) google is your friend.
all of these problems are absolutely solvable.
next time you may want seek out some help from a local user group, help forums and bulletin boards on the net, or a local power user.
in your case fedora was not a good selection for a newcomer as i will explain.further.
2) there are so many choices because there are so many people contributing to gnu/linux.
in fact, you did well.
get yourself a reasonable distro, like suse10.
and along the way you may learn more about computer technology, feel more secure not being as concerned about viruses and malware and save on software costs, .
my point is, that for me, when i need to find a file, i normally know about how the file is named, or possibly some text or some attributes that i can look for.
and lastly am i willing to do these things for a lot less money?
unlike windows, there is a wealth of information about the inner workings of linux.
its more psychological than anything else.
at least one i know was referred to as “cups”) setup tools, i finally found i had to blindly enter the mappings to the location of the pc/printer name, ‘cos nix would not show the printer even existed until after the password access to the printer had been validated.
as a starting point, use distrowatch ( http://www.distrowatch.com ) as a starting point to gather info about the current distributions.
the troubles i have ran into in the past when trying linux has been stuff like my sound card could not be configured correctly, or my graphics card had no drivers, or my printer would only print in black and white.
so if you have to search for causes, search at yourself first.
this site is good for reccomending a distrobution.
i was expecting the usual rant for/against windows.
i think perhaps the only thing you did wrong was venture into the world of operating systems when your only real concern was user applications of an operating system.
it’s a bit too easy to complain about linux when all you’ve tried is one distribution, and one that comes without support even.
it is bound to fail, as it did this time.
please continue to send your money to micro$oft and if it occurs to you, maybe you can beg them for something that works reliably, securely and trouble free.
if something crashes you can boot with minimal settings and still correct a damaged “ini” file using the cli and a very simple editor.
the five cds contain all of the base packages such as apache, mysql, nis, etc.
just take the time to adjust to the different mindset.
i learnt this when i start using linux…that was about a year ago.
gnome desktop – i could find no way to alter what items appeared in their applications menu.
i like configuration files, and i can see the beauty of them (remote administration of a server through ssh).
i hope you give linux another shot!
if you have asked your admin to mount a cd for you, you don’t want someone else to eject it while you’re working on it.
windows clearly displays my different drive volumes –
what’s that!?), and i never ran into the sort of problems you describe.
i was looking at a login screen.
i think that this entire thread is a good example of just how mis-understood and mis-treated people’s intents can become.
they’re both bootable cd’s, so you won’t even have to install them to try them out.
you should expect help.
err…my last thought should have said: i do appreciate, though, that you are *not* blindly condemning linux.
my conclusion is that you thought that linux is just another windows and instead of trying the water, you dived right in.
it is familiar turf too.
(but i do not really believe it, ms will make it again
today, still as a linux newbie, i run ubuntu on my laptop – with no problems!
but mostly we are afraid to ask questions or comment about our frustration because of the way we are received in the linux community.
- third point: research research research more….for what you need.
i’d remind readers of the following two lines which i included in my original text.
linux is not windows *** if one knows linux as well as one knows windows then one can expect similar results.
two parting comments: 1) after chewing up the better part of two full  days (about 1 month ago), that particular nix pc has sat idle – i’m  back to my comfortable and familiar windows world.
so your bound to face these problems again pretty soon.
ditto for whatever the excel replacement was (calc?).
while fedora may or may not be the right choice, recall it is used by redhat to _test_
then, after checking minimum hardware requirements in the books, i threw together a basic “no frills” pc running what appeared to be more than adequate – p3 600, 3/4 gig ram, 40 gig hdd, basic lan card, old dvd reader, old tnt video, no floppy, no sound, no extras.
get yourself a reasonable machine in terms of performance.
they all are very easy and amazing distro for me.
summary: you want to “get to work” straight away?
i’m not a windows fan, but i am a windows user.
windows is hardly the standard.
get accustomed to the fact that historically speaking it is dos and windows that are ‘all different’.
finally get to the “ok, now install it all” & waited….
you, yourself must change if you plan to adopt another os.
a last thing: as mentioned before by others: be prepared to use a root password in vista.
and each time i found show stoppers that prevented me from going further.
yeah, i’d have a similar bunch of comments if i was  an old unix user trying windows for the first time.
we are ignorant of the micro-operation intricies of linux, and we probably always will be.
a long time linux user would probably think of the tools that make linux such a powerful unix like system.
all i’m  trying to say is that there is a *considerable* learning curve to the change.
however, there will be some learning curve for all users, and if you’re not willing to take the time and effort to overcome that, then “stick with what you know” is the best advice.
i think you’ll find that the learning curve is not quite as steep as you think.
but do not believe what you may have heard that “it is easy” or “you will be up and running quickly”.
when using mandriva, i’ve hardly ever had to edit a configuration file by hand.
it was free as a download.
take for example, the root password thing as well as the command “dir”.
several people have looked at the original or existing systems and decided to improve them, giving you a choice of systems to use.
i’d expect to need a bunch of time to get used to their idea of an interface.
menus in *ux need lots of work “a simple â€œdirâ€ in the shell doesnâ€™t work.
it configures all necessary parts from the gui, and gives you access to the so called debian repositories, ‘the largest collection of software created by man’….
you probably whine a lot.
this leverages my time.
often, it is faster than clicking yourself through thousands of menus (reboot included after using linux for some years now, i am completely lost when people ask me to fix their windows computer: how do i get to know what graphics adapter is installed?
start button (ok, or  whatever fedora calls it) is at top left, not at bottom.
by how about at home?
many of windows security problems can be traced to exactly this difference in philosophy.
start button (ok, or whatever fedora calls it) is at top left, not at bottom.
i see that the original writer’s intent was to show that it is not such an easy thing to switch ones operating system.
you assumed your knowledge is generic.
windows assumes that it’s ok to autorun sony’s rootkit installer without even asking you, just because you put the cd in the drive.
i am just an ordinary 44 yrs old man.
the same can’t be said for ubuntu installation though.
you can run it off the cd before installing.
most of us convertees do not want to become linux guru’s and teach in a collage or something.
fedora’s probably one of the hardest to use (others will disagree, i’m sure).
trouble is, *nix is so configurable that they were simply unusable.
(but stick with the software that comes with your distro until you consider yourself an expert, or you’ll get into no end of trouble.)
i have no idea what some of ‘em related to… but what the heck.
first some personal background.
spent some time accepting defaults for the disk partitioning and making various choices about what to install.
from a shell (what, coloured background by default… ummm different) established that mysql had loaded, and from mysql docos got the server process running.
actually, everything is different from windows, but the point is that if you want to use a new system, you have to expect a learning curve.
did you ever post q’s in newsgroups?
email, browsing, wiritng a letter, printing to a locally attached printer, that kind of thing.
or am i willing to use a collectively developed piece of software that might do the same job and sometimes better?
windows doesn’t “just work” as some people claim, either.
but what it really comes down to is, jumping onto linux is like learning a new language.
believe me, 99.9% of malaysian never heard of linux.
don’t object when this is the same case with linux.
i think few users need to edit config files by hand on a regular basis.
i really prefer the linux environment.
remember your  first system.ini edit?
yeah, i’d have a similar bunch of comments if i was an old unix user trying windows for the first time.
and never dive in before trying the water.
best of luck next time.
i’m sure you’ve read the reason behind the need for a root and normal user accounts in the books you’ve bought.
i showed her that firefox was already up and running on desktop 2.
however, your problem is…you’re thinking other oss are suppose to be like windows, and you expect them to be molded that way before you accept them.
a more newbie friendly distro would have made the experience, while still difficult, much better.
