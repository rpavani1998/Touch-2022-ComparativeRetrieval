a lot of universities here and abroad are still using windows, it's a fact.
if big companies are looking for these professionals, universities will have no choice but to offer curriculums that are ms technology related, this will again ensure the future of the windows platform.
anonymous said, july 9, 2009 6:13 am i would add that linux is what the user wants and microsoft is what the big businesses want.
i run linux for like an month, and yet no security breach occured.
anonymous said, july 10, 2009 9:57 am the biggest problem with this observation is that it's based on an individuals experience on a particular os popularity or os usability.
you don't even need best gear to run most of needed tools nd games built for linux.
i like the simple fact that there is nothing new in these posts from posts 8 years ago.
linux gets developed by a community of people who are willing solve problems and share not just their solutions, but how their solutions work.
just the fact that there is no licensing tracking involved in open source alone is huge.
30 years after the nimble microsoft outmanouvered the lumbering big blue, the tables have turned, and microsoft are now the elephant in the living room.
as microsoft has 80% of the desktop market, i think you tell where i am going with this one.
trying to change behavior of the user community like it's a child you want to stay in bed by a boogy man microsoft under the bed is a failure.
if your choice is new machine and win7 or switch to a mac (and replace all your apps with a mac version), well the new machine/win7 upgrade is _both_ cheaper and more familiar.
yes, any 3rd party commercial vendor needs to go through the same pain in porting their proprietary app on either platform, its just that until vendors move their wares, windows on arm or any other hardware platform (without drivers or apps) is patently useless.
to run win7 pretty much requires a new(ish) computer and they mean to end-of-life xp to force you to move (so they can get paid).
but i bet you will see a lot of windows machine.
in fact...i listen to music while i play....so there's another performance benefit.
its no wonder that because of games on windhoze machine no serious development is being done.
your original point seemed to be that malware is not a problem on more recent versions of windows.
" because your so stupid to know that you are being hacked.
like they release chrome for windows first before your linux.
i can now run 3 vm's simultaneously...while listening to music on the free rhythmbox...with still plenty of memory & disk space left over.
next up, "ms isn't afraid of linux teh own the software world, apple has more market share than linux".
m$'s own numbers show gnu/linux at abut twice the rate of macos.
solutions are sold, not shared.
windowsce is not proof of windows portability to arm.
i cited cornficker to demonstrate that even the most recent version of windows has security problems which linux users do not have to deal with.
open source isn't available for everything, but what is out there is great stuff.
the only thing that i think that isn't all to on the ball with the linux thing is firefox.
if i want a game console, i'll buy a ps3.
their monopoly starts bleeding from every socket, just like ie is doing to firefox.
cloud computing, which makes os's (and a lot of software in general) irrelevant, is what ms is worried about."
our operating systems on our three computers which are a 9 year old emachines, a 3 year old dell laptop and an aspire one: antix and fedora.
linux can very quickly move the whole stack, kernel, drivers and oss apps; and be useful relatively quickly.
anonymous said, july 9, 2009 3:02 pm # dd if=/home/idiots of=/dev/null that does copy, not move.
on my linux run computer, i can dig into any file of any program and learn how that program works.
vista was a huge blow for ms, a lot hangs on win7 and linux will play its part but its xp that win7 has to eat.
unless if they stop making firefox for windows you will see it as an advantage.
if your grandparents (you can training them now) have started using linux then you are right, that ms needs to be very afraid of linux, if that's not happening yet then shut your mouth and get a life.
in terms of quality, they can rival any proprietary software made for windows.
it's a completely different operating system that happens to be made by the same company and gets called by a similar name.
unless if they stop making firefox for windows you will see it as an advantage.
software can be installed on the user's computer without the user's knowledge.
see above, the advantage is no windows.
you need to wait for all the hardware vendors to port and release their apps too.
windows is sort of portable.
once they settle into foss products, switching the o/s behind these products is the next step.
sure some folks might know of all three choices, windows, mac and linux and still choose windows for some reason (maybe games or cad work or business accounting) but the majority of the windows computers/users don't fall in those categories.
plus, i myself like opera - which works even on windows 98se, and is a bit faster (my cpu is slow enough to make the difference noticeable).
i open up my package manager, search for what i want in the search box, click on it, click on apply, and wait for the program to install itself.
the truth is that linux is slowly becoming more known, which is putting a dent in microsoft's profits.
you want to work use linux.
the graph showing os market share percentages has the same size wedge for linux as there is for osx, same size wedge = same size market share.
regarding penetration of desktop market, only one of the 3 computers we own were purchased with linux on it.
anonymous said, july 9, 2009 7:55 pm err, i meant to say that, "linux is closer to being the same operating system as os x (not the old macos) than windowsce is to being the same operating system as windows 7 (or any other member of the nt series).
i can even make any changes i want.
my point remains the same: the *average* user, that notorious "joe sixpack" gets frustrated when his pc slows to a crawl.
also i'd rather get actual work done on my pc without getting bsod or my system slowing down.
linux is more secure than even the most recent versions of windows.
just the fact that there is no licensing tracking involved in open source alone is huge.
and there's nothing quite so influential as a pc technician who's linux savvy: far more effective that a penguinista or a windows troll.
however, rather than tossing them into the linux swimming pool, i let them wade in by replacing their corrent proprietary software with foss variants.
ms knows they cant beat linux/foss on price or quality, they can't buy out the underlying software that oss companies are based on.
oh and notice the url it's arm, let me guess you will windowsce is not windows because of ce.
while penguinistas are wasting time and effort with paranoid conspiracy theories and ignoring the simple fact consumers stick with what they know.
a) applications: not much use if your computer is a virus and worm infected spambot.
linux is open, so its capabilities are known and new features can be added, old ones removed.
applications: not much use if your computer is a virus and worm infected spambot.
if this will not change then i think ms have no reason to be scared at all.
b) sure, many games aren't aviable for linux.
if a windows guy is stating facts it's fud if it's coming from linux a**holes it's not.
yes, for any os, the drivers and apps need to be recompiled along with the os kernel and others subsystems.
window manager like openbox makes you work lighting fast as soon as you get used to configuration you choose.
i would add that linux is what the user wants and microsoft is what the big businesses want.
retailers would be fine selling machines with linux pre-installed but if customers even know what it is, they think it it's for geeks or have been seeing a couple of years of rabid linux advocates leaving strange comments in forums and threads that are virulent anti-redmond and have almost nothing to do with with the subject.
that someone like me, with no training in it other than one class 27 years ago can install and run linux, that non professionals like my wife can use linux, that kids from my neighborhood, which is far from a wealthy neighborhood can use linux more than proves that linux is quite useable.
the old security canard "no os is completely safe, so therefore windows security doesn't suck" that's like saying since no building can stop every thief your shitty apartment with a $15 deadbolt is as secure as fort knox.
the guy who sees 50 machines in his section, is checking out dvds, giving info at the dentist and basically seeing almost every transaction done on a windows pc isn't buying it.

what this means is that as a computer user, i can put into practice what i try to teach my students to do in the classroom.
you see what ms is afraid of is they need people to buy win7 and office whatever-the-latest version-is.
even one of the safest os (openbsd) in the planet have vulnerabilities.
applications: not much use if your computer is a virus and worm infected spambot.
windows portability", i did not say it means portability, i just corrected mr. timdor when he erroneously bragged that windows don't support arm.
linux already has support for most hardware architectures.
this is ms number one main concern, not the one listed by the author of this site and being defended by morons here.
while there is the uac built into vista, unfortunately, i've still seen virii come through, and have even tested the conficker worm myself.
that you would mention windows ce as proof of windows portability proves that you know even less about computers than i do.
i've heard tell of c & c++ apps running in linux with some recompiling (not sure how true that is).
i should also mention, that many windows games can be played through wine, if that really is your thing.
security: cornficker infects vista too.
yeah, i think somebody actually managed to break into fort knox once, just once.
linux can very quickly move the whole stack, kernel, drivers and oss apps; and be useful relatively quickly.
yes, for any os, the drivers and apps need to be recompiled along with the os kernel and others subsystems.
it's puzzling all the buzz from the linux community centered on fighting for scrapes with apple while microsoft was filling in holes with products like sharepoint and dynamics.
i would thing that it would put the company in a better position, as it doesn't require a specific os, and therefore is not dependent on the specific os, which in turn offers additional security flaws and vulnerabilities.
most games will run on wine with some tweaking, even crysis(only on high graphics or above).
anything comes free finds taker stole breads, vegetables anything linux is that i think this is delicious, the picture in this article is from a slide being presented by ballmer at a shareholder meeting.
ok...games are fine i'm sure.....
also most users can't maintain their systems anyway
# dd if=/home/idiots of=/dev/null that does copy, not move.
that means linux can run on anything from a dedicated appliance to a supercomputer.
dont have to use firefox can use anything.
it would smooth the way for consumer acceptance.
the truth is ms *is* afraid of linux/foss, according to their own quotes.
information is locked into closed proprietary formats.
congratulations on displaying less maturity than these 11 year olds.
i've seen so many closed source applications that are garbage, and cost way more than what they should.
i'm even happier that as a linux user, i don't have to worry about finding solutions to such problems.
that's the best time to compare his glorious windows box with my set up: faster boot time, similar software choices, better menu organization, etc.
as a teacher, i help my students to become more free as individuals.
i bet noone can do that with windows nor macos.
it's a completely different operating system that happens to be made by the same company and gets called by a similar name.
cost/useability - i am an elementary school teacher, wife a social worker.
even though firefox does run on linux it also runs on windows.
ms got to be where they are by being the cheapest, their whole company was built on it.
personally, i play wow through wine, with no performance loss.
sure some folks might know of all three choices, windows, mac and linux and still choose windows for some reason (maybe games or cad work or business accounting) but the majority of the windows computers/users don't fall in those categories.
vista was a huge blow for ms, a lot hangs on win7 and linux will play its part but its xp that win7 has to eat.
during this time peroid, my dad's xp got some spyware/trojan (that i yet didn't managed to clean) rendering it totally useless.
related jobs is certainly a good indicator of this trend.

personally, i think that if the only reason you're buying ms windows is for the games, you really ought to just get yourself a gaming console.
security - timdor is completely correct.
they learn to live with things like: no more pimping of their instant messenger clients, etc.
software is not shared, not even sold, but licensed.
personally, i'm a firm believer of creating software that will run on any platform, independent of the os.
their software was rarely the best but always cheaper than the competition.
work cannot be done at all on a windhoze machine.
personally, i think that if the only reason you're buying ms windows is for the games, you really ought to just get yourself a gaming console.
problem is, in this brave new world of alternate devices, as soon as a new hardware platform emerges, linux will be far better able to fill the niche quickly than the lumbering beast of redmond.
to run win7 pretty much requires a new(ish) computer and they mean to end-of-life xp to force you to move (so they can get paid).

during the vista fiasco microsoft had record revenue because their server product line was exhibiting double digit growth, while the client services, windows desktop, showed a -8% shrink.
what happens when ms pushes for the next round of upgrade cash and the average consumer has become aware of an alternative that is as easy to use as osx and the cheapest of all, free.
lack of games is the fault of the publisher not linux.

you can check apple's unit production in their sec filings.

but with linux in the equation switching to linux on your current hardware is the cheapest of all, it only takes time.

sorry vista, but the short fact remains...most viruses built are built to target the ms windows os, whether that be xp, vista, or 7.
like they release chrome for windows first before your linux.
none of them currently run windows, yet based on how statistics regarding os use seem to be gathered, 2 out of 3 computers in my household are windows computers.
the only machine that is safe from hacking and trojan are those machine that are turned off.
anything can be hacked.
i've seen so many closed source applications that are garbage, and cost way more than what they should.
i have been running ubuntu and debian distributions for over 4 years now without antiviral software nor a firewall, and the number of virus, spyware, etc., attacks that i have suffered total zero!!!!
err, i meant to say that, "linux is closer to being the same operating system as os x (not the old macos) than windowsce is to being the same operating system as windows 7 (or any other member of the nt series).
try visiting a universities like here in cebu, i don't know how many have installed linux.
cost - i'm a windows user....sure...but only through virtualbox now.
linux is portable and scalable.
this fiscal environment should have ceos and cios and cfos slapping in linux servers like crazy.
if apple can triple it's marketshare during vista with a $1,000+ entry fee while linux barely moved the needle, it's pretty easy to draw the conclusion the current strategy won't work.

mu buddy got linux running on some low-standard mp4 (not an ipod, not a creative).
that means i as a computer user have the opportunity to not just use these software solutions, but to learn how these solutions work.
with them, knowledge is to be horded not shared.
windows biggest comeptitor is windows, thats what keeps them awake at night in redmond.
while there is the uac built into vista, unfortunately, i've still seen virii come through, and have even tested the conficker worm myself.
security - timdor is completely correct.
those with knowledge have to sign nondisclosure agreements.
ubuntu were able to turn around and port the complete stack of their offering inside a few months (weeks?).
if big companies are looking for these professionals, universities will have no choice but to offer curriculums that are ms technology related, this will again ensure the future of the windows platform.
i would thing that it would put the company in a better position, as it doesn't require a specific os, and therefore is not dependent on the specific os, which in turn offers additional security flaws and vulnerabilities.
that loyal customers prefer their 8 year old product over current production is the biggest concern imho.
linux has undoubtably moved on and so has windows.
then i see the perfect candidate to begin explaining why linux would be a superior platform.
they know how devastating an advantage price is.
it's puzzling all the buzz from the linux community centered on fighting for scrapes with apple while microsoft was filling in holes with products like sharepoint and dynamics.
the only firewall they have against linux is awareness/familiarity.
i had been reading about ms thinking linus's share was on par with osx, nice to finally find an example.
windowsce is not proof of windows portability to arm.
the only reason i can see for you giving such an immature response is because you realize that any windows machine can easily become a virus and worm infected spambot unless up to date antivirus and antimalware programs are constantly running in the background.
i'd rather mention iceweasel, konqueror and other linux-natixe browsers that are unusable at windows.
am microsoft isn't afraid of either apple or linux because apple can't support the enterprise and remain apple, and linux went ubuntu blind and you don't ever hear anything pertaining to linux except the desktop.
m$'s own numbers show gnu/linux at abut twice the rate of macos.
meanwhile, apple's mac os x is tightly locked on its own hardware so i don't see its growth as long-term.
i had been reading about ms thinking linus's share was on par with osx, nice to finally find an example.
linux's primary distribution method is not through retail channels, it's count is under reported.
i should also mention, that many windows games can be played through wine, if that really is your thing.
because ordinary users don't give a damn if your linux is cool because you can compile your programs yourselves.
more importantly, i use it because the philosophy underlying linux is very similar to my philosophy as an educator.
i like the simple fact that there is nothing new in these posts from posts 8 years ago.
even one of the safest os (openbsd) in the planet have vulnerabilities.
ms got to be where they are by being the cheapest, their whole company was built on it.

i can still get in your shitty apartment with a hammer, good luck trying that with fort knox.

while i am a ms sw engineer, i prefer to use fedora 11 x86_64 (gnome) as my desktop.
but with linux in the equation switching to linux on your current hardware is the cheapest of all, it only takes time.
their software was rarely the best but always cheaper than the competition.
the majority of users had windows chosen for them by virtue of ms's (now failing) strangle hold on oems and their conscious choice to *not* by a mac, generally based on price.
so a user friendly linux alternative is actually a viable sollution in the future.

linux already has support for most hardware architectures.
ubuntu were able to turn around and port the complete stack of their offering inside a few months (weeks?).
anonymous said, july 9, 2009 4:51 am lol i so saw that troll post coming.
it took microsoft about 10 minutes to blow past linux as the majority os on netbooks.
the only firewall they have against linux is awareness/familiarity.
#dd if=/home/idiots of=/dev/null sorry, i'm a grammar/command line correctness nazi.
on the other hand: students at college or university can get microsoft operating systems and some office programs for free and are legitimate to use it as long as they study.
microsoft isn't afraid of either apple or linux because apple can't support the enterprise and remain apple, and linux went ubuntu blind and you don't ever hear anything pertaining to linux except the desktop.
operating system use at my church's computer lab for neighborhood kids, ubuntu.
the windows pc will be shit slow.
our operating systems on our three computers which are a 9 year old emachines, a 3 year old dell laptop and an aspire one: antix and fedora.
the biggest problem with this observation is that it's based on an individuals experience on a particular os popularity or os usability.
while i am a ms sw engineer, i prefer to use fedora 11 x86_64 (gnome) as my desktop.
a) applications: not much use if your computer is a virus and worm infected spambot.
"...pretty much every os in the planet have (sic) security issues..."
m$ is a dinosaur whose brain has not gotten the message that they are in the tar pit.
none of them currently run windows, yet based on how statistics regarding os use seem to be gathered, 2 out of 3 computers in my household are windows computers.
i open up my package manager, search for what i want in the search box, click on it, click on apply, and wait for the program to install itself.
oh and notice the url it's arm, let me guess you will windowsce is not windows because of ce.
also i'd rather get actual work done on my pc without getting bsod or my system slowing down.
in response to "now this is fud, you can suck my windows ass.
next up, "ms isn't afraid of linux teh own the software world, apple has more market share than linux".
now this is fud, you can suck my windows ass.
that why you are doing thing personal website rather than business see this linux cant beat 10 year old abandoned os http://darklydreamingdavid.wordpress.com/2007/09/04/further-proof-that-linux-is-all-hype-and-has-no-future/ all the linux fans are poors who save money to buy clothes and food.
microsofties are aware of this and are doing everything they can tostop the growth of firefox and in effect linux.
lack of games is the fault of the publisher not linux.
just a suggestion to the owner of this site instead of posting ms related stuffs that only attracts trolls like me, why not start with something constructive like, a better payroll software for linux or a quickbooks alternative for linux, something that will attract small businesses and big companies too, instead of ms fud and misinformation.
as microsoft has 80% of the desktop market, i think you tell where i am going with this one.
#dd if=/home/idiots of=/dev/null sorry, i'm a grammar/command line correctness nazi.
the person helping them is likely the same.
don't sneer at gui server management and belittle those mcses who use it because they have never used anything else.
trying to change behavior of the user community like it's a child you want to stay in bed by a boogy man microsoft under the bed is a failure.
you can not analyse anything you cant afford your little brain to do that.
2.linux is free and works great :p. you havent tried linux or are just bashing it because you dont like it.
linux is more secure than even the most recent versions of windows.

they are facing a slow bleed to a awareness tipping point then their monopoly is lost.
window manager like openbox makes you work lighting fast as soon as you get used to configuration you choose.
i'm even happier that as a linux user, i don't have to worry about finding solutions to such problems.
security windows is still the most insecure os and it is possible that anotherdevastating virus will strike and harm computers running with it.
don't sneer at gui server management and belittle those mcses who use it because they have never used anything else.
mu buddy got linux running on some low-standard mp4 (not an ipod, not a creative).
as a teacher, i help my students to become more free as individuals.
anything can be hacked.
yes, any 3rd party commercial vendor needs to go through the same pain in porting their proprietary app on either platform, its just that until vendors move their wares, windows on arm or any other hardware platform (without drivers or apps) is patently useless.
i am quite comfortable with whatever choice my customers make.
problem is, in this brave new world of alternate devices, as soon as a new hardware platform emerges, linux will be far better able to fill the niche quickly than the lumbering beast of redmond.
firefox since firefox has beenrapidly eating internet explorer's web browser market share, the free and open source software community is more positive than ever that linux can be as successful on the desktop.
linux sure is free but its capability is valuable.
that loyal customers prefer their 8 year old product over current production is the biggest concern imho.
pm you can not analyse anything you cant afford your little brain to do that.
because ordinary users don't give a damn if your linux is cool because you can compile your programs yourselves.
if the openbsd team fixed those two existing security holes, then openbsd would kick ***.
this fiscal environment should have ceos and cios and cfos slapping in linux servers like crazy.
work cannot be done at all on a windhoze machine.
furthermore, games that run on both windows and native linux tend to work faster at linux than on windows.
ah yes, the standard windows fud from the anonymous troll.
microsoft was terrified of linux to point of a fud website, threatening to sue businesses for ip infringement and bribing...er investing in linux companies.
you want to play use windows.
in a university, as well as at an elementary school, knowledge is something to be shared, not horded.
they know how devastating an advantage price is.
