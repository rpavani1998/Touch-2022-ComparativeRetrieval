developers need to get the opportunity to chose from a wide variety of cross-platform languages and tools, for them ever to produce cross-platform software.developers should stake a claim and make the best desktop linux software they can.linux desperately needs native applications if it is going to survive.companies may look to try out linux with this support for windows, but they find that their commercial software isn't supported by the manufacturer if it's running under linux (and in some cases, doing so is in violation of the eula).for linux as a platform-- wine's harmful effects: wine hurts the linux platform by allowing windows applications to run on linux.wine provides a windows compatability layer than windows applications run against.linux developers have even fewer employment opportunities for linux software development.that would translate into a very negative user experience for end-users and would give linux a big black eye in the process.it supported 16-bit and "win32s" windows applications by running them in a separate virtual machine, but the process was transparent enough to make it look seamless.in this light, this discussion boils down to the fact that the free os suffers from heavy competition of the commercial os - all because most of the so-called 'popular applications' just don't run (well enough) on the free os.new applications would require this new layer to function and thus be incompatible outside of windows.it adds capability to linux, but to the detriment of linux itself.for linux users-- wine's harmful effects: instead of companies writing linux versions of their software, they expect linux users to run their windows applications on wine.wine could allow these people to use linux as their primary os.let's imagine for a moment that the wine project is complete and that linux can natively run all manner of windows applications.
