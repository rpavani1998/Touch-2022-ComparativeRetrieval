okay, since you clearly didn't understand what i said in my first point, i will ask you again, how easily can you configure advanced security options across multiple systems in a large environment?
this is in sharp contrast to the strong windows system which were only breached 15 % of all servers breached.

i admit that in some casses its better to use windows solutions like exchange and office.
many black hats don't even bother with windows exploits, while others specialize in them.
their are also 100's of ways of doing it with free software, you see thats the problem with windows theirs only one solution for a problem and if you dont like that solution its to bad for you.
and from the obvious maturity of linux zealots, we can see why linux is losing it's edge.

so you go look at unix performance, and unix security and then talk.
anyone who as much as raised the slightest objection to being robed of their intellectual property was immediately viciously attacked from all angles by the linux propaganda machine, using lies, disinformation and methods that would make even hitler blush!
