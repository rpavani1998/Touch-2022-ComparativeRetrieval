the guys who don't like linux come with things like "linux is less compatible."
since when did redhat cost money?
almost certainly, because only people who really wanted to work as performing musicians would stick it out.
i find it amazing you forget the idiot proof point and click gui for every microsoft program.
i get that i could get more use out of a linux machine.
in reality, it's those things that have made the platform the success  that it is.
but there is absolutely no standard for those things and no guarantee that an uninstall works.
openoffice.org - the free and open productivity suite pidgin, the universal chat client scintilla and scite virtualbox vlc media player - open source multimedia framework and player you just don't get it.
this is not to say that there are no  problems.
they haven't really jumped any boats.

now if some of you people like windows, thats great.
consider that "linux" of course refers to the kernel and  the history of linux kernel development is unprecedented.
if i bought it without knowing whether or not it was supported on linux, then i have to eat it.

i think it already has a robust and sustainable user base and that people will continue to be attracted to it in the future just like they were in the past.
but the issues there have very little to do with ease of use desktop-y issues, and which distro does what how.
i laugh and my first thought is to the animal farm; human nature, being what it is.

what a load of crap, mk.
originally posted  bykermit i think i can agree with you on some of this.
would the quality of music (not it's stock market value) in general be better?
if i want to be sure it is supported i buy stuff that i know works.
or maybe the "incompatible" talk refers to hardware - like wifi and such.
my new ipod is great!
this is not to say that there are no problems.
still a no go - if the vendor of the hardware makes no driver for linux, whose fault is it that it won't run?
then you get no support, of course, which might be hassle if you are running a commercial server and cannot afford me (actually you could probably afford me, but get the picture).
i have no desire to think when it comes to checking fark and cracked after work.
i think you could always give red hat money for support, which is what they are selling now.
that is funny - i would bet money that linux runs on more systems than windows does.
these are the things that i need that are windows specific: active@ hard disk monitor.
consider that "linux" of course refers to the kernel and the history of linux kernel development is unprecedented.
mk, i'm in college, working full time, and married with a 2 year old.
dumbass viscous circle.
i would think it's a problem of linux having too many different distros.
it's for  businesses, servers, that kind of stuff.
especially if you are working over a network via ssh, in which case you get no gui.
for those who are happy without it, that's great.
and i'd be nuts to think i'd be doing them a favor by recommending they switch to linux.
sometimes the term "libre" is used because i believe in the romance languages there are two words for "free", with slightly different connotations.
realize i'm not talking about a programmer's needs.
originally posted by brewbuck: reimplementing a large system in another language to get a 25% performance boost is nonsense.
if you say that there is software thatwon't run on linux thatwill run on windows, fine - i will give you that, but really, is that a fault of linux?
there is no need to try and pitch it or attract even more people.
like i said, there are no shareholders who will  benefit, it's not a stock you can purchase, so achieving a greater market share  is just a macho goal.
as i watch all of you talk about the ease of doing command line installs....
you'd be better off doing sudoku on the couch.
yeah, i can still install multiple programs at the terminal with one line while you go and download and install all of the applications separately.
linux is not fast food, and it is not a commercial product.
sittin' on the dock of the bay posts 8,176 originally posted by lpaulgib i  really do get it.
also, the point was that most linux distros have preinstalled free fully functional office programs/suites (be it ooo or gnumeric + abiword, or whatever else), not chopped down trial versions.
such is the case with my computers at this time.
i'm talking about 90% of america.
if i were running a server or anything requiring real work, i'd go with linux.

if only someone had the gumption and foresight to foresee what pure greed would do to "the entertainment industry", we'd probably be living in a much more interesting world.
i know of it because it was the only program that ran word documents on linux at the time.
as an aside, i am kind of glad some things are not compatible with linux.
linux does a horrible job of selling itself.
the idea that it has to be sold or promoted to people is just silly.
good thing only one file is needed then, an .exe or an .msi, you have fun with you dependencies then ;-) how i need a drink, alcoholic in nature, after the heavy lectures involving quantum mechanics.
originally posted by lpaulgib i bet you guys couldn't even agree on a distro if i asked you which one was best.
so often people are encouraged to switch to linux (when windows worked fine for them) - they try it and, after a bad experience, they not only turn away, but have scorn for it too.
they forked into fedora, which is more or less the same thing, and kept the brandname for redhat, which the money you pay is for support.

part of the purpose of distro package management is to correct such errors by individual developers.
burning an iso off a pre-installed windows to undo what has been done for them makes no sense.
it's a pain in the ass to hunt down a good distro, burn the iso's, lose everything i already have.....only to gain something that isn't as compatable, has less support, and doesn't really do anything that i need to do.
keep doing that and they just might conform, like good consumers it's a pain in the ass to hunt down a good distro, burn the iso's, i suppose it was easier to earn the $1000 bucks you paid for the computer so that you can treat it as another opportunity to turn your brain off because you are too tired to think from earning the money you need to buy all these toys and tools that make your life "easier".
i can install linux on any machine, run my little installation script and tweak the power settings and that's it.
i have no problem with that, but don't go bashing linux guys because it is the cool thing to be anti-linux.
i absolutely love my consumer crap.
i have friends who have windows computers at home and the whole family uses them and such
or is that not "cool" enough for you?
the goal nothing has whether or not a distro wants to charge money.
redhat is still (by necessity) all gpl licensed software, so there is nothing illegal about "pirating" it.
it would be cheaper to just get a computer which is 25% faster.
and notice -- this os is free.

it is a fairly unique phenomenon in this sense.
this knowledge typically presents a steep learning curve and for those who don't care to learn what it takes, it is an insurmountable obstacle.
i think the problems you think might be corrected by attending to such a goal are not really problems with the system, they are just because you are new to it.
the distro's also keep track of security risks and other problems -- they are contributing a very significant oversight layer.
that's part of the point.
you're a programmer: youshould do that.
redhat is still (by necessity) all gpl licensed software, so there is nothing  illegal about "pirating" it.
alternative philosophies.
i just want to click a giant logo and see entertaining stuff.
i don't get mad if i buy something with hardware that does not work on linux.
then, subsequent to all that, you can use the standard interface offered the package manager (by which i mean, yum or apt) to query stuff like what files a package installed, where they are located, etc. yum: repoquery --list package apt: dpkg-query -l package ba-boom, done.
i figure if someone wants to learn all the little things it takes to get a linux system up an running, they will, they will stick with it, and they will get there under their own steam.

someone earlier mentioned the office suite i think.
so thank the universe for gnu/linux!
also it's a great way to understand the fundamental elements of the system.
most things that you need are already there.
smart diagnostic & hdd health control software for windows xp vista 2003 server 2008...
openoffice.org... works on windows too you know.
so you have skipped a few steps that have to occur before you get to the apparently easy point and click, which you can save yourself all that trouble with one quick powerful command.
has it got anything to do at all with linux being a crappy os?

windows 7 came with my pc.
i don't think "what america wants" deserves any kind of attention at all unlessyou are out to make money feeding animals deep fried cheese.
i mean seriously, if there was some app that only ran on apple computers, would you bash windows because it couldn't run it?
i bet you guys couldn't even agree on a distro if i asked you which one was best.
i've yet to see how it's that bad for  most people.
i  actually wouldn't recommend linux to anyone.

i bought an hp computer with windows 7, and i am sick and tired of the nagware put on there by hp and norton (again, this is not the fault of microsoft - at least not directly) that i actually hate booting into windows.
they  forked into fedora, which is more or less the same thing, and kept the  brandname for redhat, which the money you pay is for support.
fedora branched off and basically became free red hat.
the only reason i use windows is to run dragon naturally speaking - now that nuance makes a dictation product for macs, i see no reason to keep a windows install around at all.
