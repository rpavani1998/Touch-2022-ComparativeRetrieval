eliminating the cost of the operating system would allow the buyer to reduce the price or to obtain better hardware at the same cost.linux takes a different approach to writing files and, as a result, fragmentation is far less likely to occur until the disk drive is nearly full.i still can't realistically see a time when linux will be the king of the desktop, but i know for certain that linux does most of the tasks needed by a large number of computer users.ubuntu 9.04 can work acceptably in both desktop and server roles, but it's far less robust as a server os than as a desktop os.security advantage (sometimes): some linux distributions take security more seriously than others, but generally speaking linux and unix machines have been more secure than windows.it will happily use large amounts of memory and high-power video cards, but linux manages to get along better than windows does on low-power machines.part of the cost of a computer is the operating system and windows adds about $200 to the cost of the hardware.one-stop-shopping advantage: when you're looking for an application, and particularly if you're using one of the more consumer-oriented distributions ("distros" in linux-speak), adding an application is as easy as selecting add programs from a menu and picking the applications you want from a list that's divided into categories (utilities, programming, office, games, and such).performance advantage: linux can generally do more with less hardware.linux doesn't store all of the important configuration information in a single gigantic (and easily corrupted) file as windows does.vista's security is good, although cumbersome, and windows 7 will probably be better.disk advantage: because of the way windows writes to hard drives, files become fragmented.products and services are mentioned for informational purposes and their various trademarks and service marks are the property of their respective owners.reliability advantage: recently, when windows lost track of both dvd drives in my computer, i was able to determine that the problem wasn't a hardware failure by booting linux and allowing it to confirm that the drives were working.still, because linux is based on unix, the directory structure was designed from the beginning with security in mind.
