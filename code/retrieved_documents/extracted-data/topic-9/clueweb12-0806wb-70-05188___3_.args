bio-fuel is fueling a massive price rise for wheat based food and that bloody war has led the world into recession.the money could have been used for other important projects or simply to help the needy.i don't have to explain why linux is better than windows and the many advantages of using linux and other free and open source software.if only our government leaders know how to make proper use of what we have, things could change.we even have our own linux distro namedbayanihan linux that makes technical support and resources within our reach.but she has easily adapted to using linux, so there's no doubt that a computer teacher can do the same.i know that my recommended solution if implemented cannot instantaneously solve the present crisis that we as well as other poor nations are experiencing.although i agree with your point, i must say that a portion of the sales of microsoft windows go to helping developing countries.state leaders and legislators have plenty of proposed solutions with the goal of alleviating the current food shortage.for our less fortunate fellowmen, a hundred dollars is equivalent to two months of hard-earned income.get real, a days worth of bombs and bio-fuels would no doubt be worth a years worth of money saved with linux adoption.this is a fact: thousands of personal computers courtesy of the government are handed out each year to philippine public schools.however, i would like to insist that if we stop using windows now and start using linux, we could make a considerable difference for tomorrow.i'll stick with windows xp because i prefer that all my programs actually work.man's most basic need is low on supply but high in demand.
