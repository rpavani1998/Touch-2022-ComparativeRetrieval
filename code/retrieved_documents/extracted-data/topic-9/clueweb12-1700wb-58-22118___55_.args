this means that linux is largely compatible with other unix systems (the same program can be easily ported to run on another unix system with few (sometimes no) modifications) and will network seamlessly with other unix systems.our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.this means that in the event of a power failure, there is very little chance that the file system would ever be corrupted, or that manual intervention would be required to fix the file system.linux's up-and-coming graphical user interfaces (gui) are the most functional and aesthetically pleasing ever to have graced the computer screen.users have close and direct contact with developers, ensuring that bugs are fixed quickly and that user needs are met.linux is also considered far easier to maintain than any commercial unix system because of its widespread use and hence easy access to linux expertise.open industry and academic standards are adhered to, to make software consistent and compatible.in our experience (from both discussions and development), linux's critical operations are always pedantically optimized--far more than would normally be encouraged in a commercial organization.linux typically performs 50% to 100% better than other operating systems on the same hardware.this will not only improve code quality but will make the code more portable.you can make a linux system completely airtight by following a few simple guidelines, like being careful about what system services you expose, not allowing passwords to be compromised, and installing utilities that close possible vulnerabilities.linux is said to be posix compliant, meaning that it confirms to a certain definite computing standard laid down by academia and industry.the distribution has legendary technical excellence and stability.another partial reason for this superiority is that gnu software is often written by people from academic institutions who are in the center of it research and are most qualified to dictate software solutions.on the whole, freebsd is thought to have a better architecture, although linux has had the benefit of having been ported to many platforms, has a great many more features, and supports far more hardware.
