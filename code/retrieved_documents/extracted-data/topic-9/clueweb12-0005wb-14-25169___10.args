tip to the folks at ubuntu: create an installer that works with widescreen laptops.
i don't want to use the terminal with linux any more than i want to use it on os x or use dos on a windows computer.
i don't understand the reasoning behind that, although perhaps windows is considered so problematic that it's best to have a backup partition.
next already learned how to put their interface on both mach and solaris kernels.
a different os that hasn't always played well with windows.

logmein makes it easy.
ubuntu wanted to repartition my linux partition into a system partition and a scratch partition, somehow ignoring the fact that my previous installation had already created a scratch partition.
the transition to intel would be the perfect time to make the switch.
it's a bit different from what a mac user is used to, but not too divergent from the windows experience.
it also means downloading four disk images and burning four install cds.
i have a 250 gb drive inside this computer, but i didn't want to risk the installer messing up my configuration.
dreams of the best kernel and the best gui working together.
somehow it hadn't detected the 1280 x 800 native resolution of my display, so it was scaling 1024 x 768 to full screen.
in the end i concluded that i'd have to run the installer again and do a complete installation.
advice is presented in good faith, but what works for one may not work for all.
the underlying kernel is a bit of a hack, ported from next's x86-based os to the powerpc, and moving the mac to intel cpus will improve things.
then i booted from the cd and tried to install linux.
lem writers share their favorites.
also macbook air better than any ultrabook, docks for macbook pro models, intel offers improved ssds, and more.
i did find a few pages explaining how to go into the terminal and type in cryptic commands that had to be entered just so and varied for each and every graphics processor out there.
apple will begin migrating macs to intel cpus, and the new "macintel" computers will be able to run windows, linux x86, and mac os x. windows does a lot of things right, but the underlying operating system is so full of holes it makes swiss cheese look solid.
ubuntu linux for ppc step one is picking a linux distribution, and i'd heard good things about ubuntu.
the 40 gb drive came partitioned with a small first partition and two 17 gb partitions.
the current wikipedia article puts it thus: microkernels generally underperform in comparison to traditional designs, sometimes dramatically.
i'll grant that once it's installed, it's probably as easy to use as windows (which i, as a mac user, find pretty cryptic), and i can definitely make my way around in it.
the problem with mach is that microkernels are inefficient because of all the communication taking place between different parts of the operating system.

next was committed to the mach kernel five years before linus torvalds began his os, and it took a while before linux began to approach the maturity of other unix-like operating systems, so there would have been no reason for next to consider switching from mach.

it was really cool watching the acer boot into linux, and then i discovered the first problem: the installer assumes a 24- or 25-line by 80 character display, yet the widescreen display on the acer was maybe 18 or 20 lines by 80 characters.
