it therefore doesn’t come close to linux in terms of reliability.
the same goes for hardware too.
thus, if you’re making use ofdedicated servers then linux could be the better choice for you.
telnet and ssh offer users a means by which they can open a window directly on a web server and manipulate files directly.
meanwhile, windows remains the most vulnerable to viruses and other attacks as spy bots and malware have been specifically designed to infect the masses of computers running windows.
this alone easily pushes the number of linux users over the 100 million mark and makes the choice a lot harder than it may appear!

it looks to me like linux has doubled its lead and could well stretch away into the distance.

linux is also the cheaper of the two systems as most linux variants are available for free or at a much lower price than the windows equivalent.

windows can offer a much larger selection of software programs and utilities that linux simply cannot compete with.
accessing servers is a major priority for many users and whilst both systems offer ftp access, which comprises of transferring your files from your hard drive to a web server, only linux will offer telnet or ssh access.

it has always been a very secure system and compared to windows it is much more secure with far less attacks recorded.
another big factor for users is the security of the operating system they are using, and it would seem that linux have hit the back of the net with this one!
whilst linux has made great steps forward in hardware support, many companies still do not offer drivers or support for their hardware in linux whereas almost all hardware manufacturers will support their products in microsoft windows and almost all hardware products are compatible with windows.

furthermore, reliability is also a significant factor and historically linux has been able to perform for months and even years without needing to be rebooted.
everyone knows windows but linux does have a few strings to its bow.

it is indeed possible to set up telnet access on windows but very few hosting administrators will actually offer it.
