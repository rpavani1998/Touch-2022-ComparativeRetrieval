windows is unsuitable for many linux users as it fails to provide the flexibility they require.linux is unsuitable for many windows users due to being too confusing or just plain different.of course linux works well as a desktop for the people who like to learn about computers and those who have invested many hours to learn its ins and outs.lets face it, if you want to do anything serious or commercial with your computer you need to use an operating system that is commercially compatable.well, just maybe, and i really hope it happens, a distribution will revolutionize linux enough to make it distinct, user friendly, free, and powerful enough to compete against the monolith that is windows, but right now it doesn't exist.i challenge every linux expert out there to reliably run run their system for an extended period of time after it has been configured for professional use (video editing, photo processing, sound editing, or even games).windows come pre-installed on almost every desktop / laptop sold, most people do not install from scratch, they get a new computer via fedex, sign for it, plug it in and everything works.recent additions to linux desktop includes nice visual effects, similar to those in latest mac os x and windows vista.i'm an economist and linux offers all of the software tools i need.well, in windows every possible display is displayed in the control panel, and it is easy and fast to adjust the screen resolution.most non-it professionals will go for windows or mac, because there are all the needed apps for them, while linux is only good for running services/servers.windows has more options and tunables, linux comes preconfigured with a lot of "default" settings.linux can be great yes, but needs to evolve more before it can replace windows.when i install linux onto a computer, i boot it for the first time and am welcomed with a fully functional desktop.2)windows is just as flexible as linux for experts 3) windows desktop has dozens of times more apps for it than linux.
