after all, we cannot ignore the fact that despite getting competition from linux and mac since long, windows still holds the largest piece of market share pie.being a strong advocate of open-source and linux , i read a lot of articles on these topics daily.graphical effects starting from ubuntu 7.10, both the oses have given stress on providing graphical desktop effects to the end user.and, not to mention, this is the best way to encourage users to use linux.this way, you’ll get a feel of the incredible os linux is, and on the same time not lose access to your favorite (it-just-works) os (windows).although it’s a command-line application, believe me, it’s damn straight-forward, and as simple as any other gui thing.some even go to such extremes, “you know, you are wasting your precious money on this crap os (windows), which first drains all your money and then keeps on crashing.i have also heard promoters of linux say, “now that you know of all the benefits of linux, it’s time you make the switch to it from your existing os (windows).”in vista, the most common and appealing effect is flip 3d. creation of a new folder when a new file/folder is created within another folder in either of the os, the newly created item rearranges itself automatically in alphabetical order with respect to the other items contained by the parent folder.talking about linux, the latest ubuntu release (10.4; lucid lynx) has been getting good reviews from all around.in both the oses, this navigation strip is very similar looking and a helpful aid.you cannot force linux down people’s throat just because of your own reasons.thanks to its linux version, i was able to find the lost windows partition, recover it and write the updated partition table to the harddisk.note: the similarities between vista and ubuntu are primarily because of the desktop environment used by ubuntu – gnome.or better yet, using linux on a live cd/dvd/usb (or if you are a geek, you can try linux through virtualization as well).
