good luck on your ppd, we'll see in a couple of days.
it's not a real priority for stanford to put out code for w7 right now, maybe next year eh?
jeez, they just got their gpu2 beta cores going very nicely now after a hiccup last november.
compile your own little kernel in *nix, though *nix smp has to be the x64 version as i'm running in vmware atm.
freebsd is the only other thing i'd say compared to the responsiveness of the system.

i used to be able to finish them in just under 2 days, now it's about 2¼-½ or so.
i have gentoo installed on another partition on my  computer, though grub is broken atm due to installing windows 7.

i do know that my gentoo install was faster than  anything else i've used before as it was a very stipped down kernel and since  everything installed from source, it was all compiled just for my system.

hey, try smp in vmware and see if it works in w7, it would be interesting to know.
well, you know what's the best os to run this is right?;)
maybe it's just because lately i've been doing a little bit more than i did with vista, but all of the wu that i'm getting seem to be taking about 6-8 hrs longer now than they did previously.
you are all more than welcome to join us or ask specific questions about how to go about folding but please start a new thread to post your questions, this way nothing of importance will be lost and everyone here will help you out.

i'm trying to get it working but i can't get the necessary files installed (via install.bat) to get the core running and i checked over at the folding forum and it doesn't appear as though anyone over there is running w7 just yet, though they do have a placeholder for comments.

maybe since windows 7 is less  resource hungry than vista i'll have a better ppd average now.

i had a hard time getting fahmon to display too, but it was my fault as i had it pointing to the wrong directory as it is a little bit different for whatever reason in window 7 game over!!!!!!!!

join the pronetworks folding@home team.
maybe since windows 7 is less resource hungry than vista i'll have a better ppd average now.
i'll be installing w7 shortly so we can then compare notes on folding.
