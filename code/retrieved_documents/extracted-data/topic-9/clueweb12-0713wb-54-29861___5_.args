this approach also allows for more flexible partitioning strategies such as a linux swap partition mounted at /dev/hda2 right after the "/" partition for performance reasons(i.e read disk access times and seek latency numbers) also keeping a common "/home" mounted partition is a good idea for organizing your personal data with redundancy.one advantage is that if you select the linux partition at bootup then decide you want windows instead, you just choose windows when you get to the linux bootloader, thus reloading the nt bootloader again.say, if you (or anyone else) is having this error with xp, then you will need to find and download the sata drivers for your disk.we'll reinstall grub to the mbr and configure it to dualboot both ubuntu and xp.ubuntu 704 livecd could and was able to recover 99% without resort to backups which were not that current.although one can set it up manually, the easiest way is to use bootpart.xp bootloader is fairly clumsy when it comes to dualbooting and will overwrite grub completely.before burning the next cd use checksum to verify that the contents are correct.page 1 - intro updated 2 march 2009 - now uses ubuntu 9.04 as the linux distribution scenario: you want to install xp on your machine alongside your existing linux installation on the same physical drive which already has ubuntu 9.04 installed.this tutorial has been tested on a sun virtualbox 2.1.2 virtual machine.29 february 2008, 8:32 pm (4 years ago) report abuse send to a friend reply brian huang: it is not a good idea to install windows onto a drive not labeled as c. use spfdisk to hide linux partitions before installing windows.currently i have ubuntu 6.10 installed on my laptop, and i want to dual boot windows xp for the first time.when i try to install my drivers they all try to install to c:\\ and windows detected my other partitions so they were named c:\\ etc and my windows installed as g:\\. when i tried to install my modem driver it just site there looking for c:\\. is there a way of installing windows so it doesnt detect the other ubuntu partitions????i didn't realize how outdated it looks compared to the ubuntu installer!hopefully dell au will sell linux on machines in australia at the right price.
