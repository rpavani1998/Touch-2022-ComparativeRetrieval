linux is difficult to use, has no 'os' standards, lacks distro compatibility, and lacks working drivers for a lot of hardware.a well-setup linux system is magnitudes more reliable than any windows system, and much easier to support.with the amount of talent that microsoft employs, they should be able to totally blow away apple, totally blow away linux, and make users so happy that they'd be crazy to use anything other than windows.if linux were to ever catch on and reach critical mass then these same gurus and power users would have to basically start over right back at the bottom of the learning curve with the rest of the great unwashed masses; plus, there's the possibility that all their time, money and mindshare was wasted on an inferior product.but it's easier to do that, than to design something that truly is different, with new features that would attract more customers.i've tried recommending linux (ubuntu in particular) to my friends, and in all cases but one it has resulted in them not only going back to windows or mac, but actually getting turned off by linux which will make it much harder for me to recommend it in the future when it improves.from a price standpoint it would stand to loose quite a bit of revenue mainly because they do not do all of their own tech support and to guarantee more frequent calls they would have to break everything by implementing new technologies every year or two.they've got so much time, mindshare and (probably) money invested in the microsoft ecosystem that these folks are firmly entrenched.it's fully capable of doing everything windows does (and more), does it so much more efficiently, and doesn't cost a darned thing (in most cases).we edit all of our images using the gimp on windows, the gimp provides us with all of our image editing needs, it even reads and edits any photoshop files we get sent.general firefox browsing performance suffers similarly, though that is improving.rather than producing the best operating system in the world, one that would have users beating a path to their door, they produce an operating system that is pedestrian, and then try to block anyone else from the market by exclusionary deals and "marketing bonuses".considering their market share, linux should be a minor irritant.of course when there is a true competition the consumer can choose between windows os, linux, android, moblin .......more choice means products will bring us more value for money.this closed-minded, open-source mccarthyism is far more damaging to linux and the community than anything the microsoft trolls can do.
