we can never be certain which microsoft patches need to be installed: too many to choose from don't trust ms patches because of many instances of downtime caused by faulty patches linux offers great interoperabilitylinux users do not know how to use dial-up networking ms windows networks can not be browsed from linux workstations linux is immature will cause high costs in the long runevery linux distribution is it's own os - poor backwards compatibility between updates openoffice loses ms word document formatting windows applications allow the user to be more task focused than linux applications no need to do software programming to make it workthis interview was the perfect vehicle to reinforce the message that linux is the best means of reducing the cost of ownership of an it infrastructure.and that means that the companies that produce them are going to miss out on purchase decisions made by the growing number of pro-linux buyers.ms windows has a single sign-on facility that is much more secure than anything linux has to offerconclusion: fear and lack of familiarity are the key issues among ms windows users, excessive confidence among linux users is just as much a barrier to convincing ms windows devotees to at least become more familiar with linux.one respondent severely criticized microsoft for problems some users experienced with internet explorer but then excused this as a necessary side effect of a maturing technology while at the same time laying aside all consideration that linux might be going through the same maturation process.every linux distribution is it's own os - poor backwards compatibility between updates openoffice loses ms word document formatting windows applications allow the user to be more task focused than linux applications - no need to do software programming to make it work (1 mention) - windows applications are the best for the job - ms windows has one totally consistent interfacethe cost of linux support is much lower than a microsoft windows (nt4 / 2000) based solution.the cost of acquisition of a complete linux based solution (server) is much lower than an equivalent microsoft windows solution.applications: the linux graphical interface is just as easy to use as ms windows linux uses industry standards compliant protocols -- industry standard file formats alsoms sql is the best, it is fast and easy to configure windows 2000 server supports bigger files old hardware is unreliable and should not be used linux has no answer for ms terminal server windows 2000 server is not the faster file and print server, but it is 100% compatible!equally, the pro-windows respondents are unwilling to weight the real cost of the liabilities of their current infrastructure solutions this leads to an unwillingness to seriously consider alternatives.also, no respondents were aware that there is an odbc driver for postgresql and mysql that will allow ms access and ms excel to use an open source sql back-end system.
