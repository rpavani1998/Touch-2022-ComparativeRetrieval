ah, if only i could get one how gratefully i would downgrade myself to mere user!
of course, if you've got  expertise with windows and don't know (or want to know) how to do things the  unix way, then you might be better off sticking with windows.
that being said, linux is  more capable of being secured - it's configuration is less opaque and kernel  and user space are better segmented from each other.
so the short answer to "(why) is linux  more secure than linux" is: don't ask!
of all these, the fundamental problem of windows security is that all users run as admin all of the time.
perl on unix, in the hands of a guru, is a very powerful tool indeed.
a practice which has been useful and honed over decades of use.
applications can be installed anywhere.
even my favorite server os, openbsd, can get hacked  from time to time.
and although it's nice to be able to use perl on windows to drive com objects, i confess that i usually prototype my automation scripts in vbscript, and then port them to perl once they're working.
friday, november 07, 2003 actual counts of security issues and the severity of each issue is my  empricial basis for stating that one system is more secure than another.
you can probably delete any file without touching  the kernel, since admin normally owns the whole machine.
on the  other hand in windows i would merely have had to click share connection and  enable firewall
laszlo marai friday, november 07, 2003 oh, and one more thing - i don't want to convince you about using debian,  or linux, where i was trying to get at is that you might have had a hard time  with linux, because you didn't use the right tool/distribution and yopu  shouldn't judge based on those experiences.
i  abort the other installation and click on the other link which then starts the  11mb download, which it appears doesn't actually check if you have anything  that needs patching until you have downloaded the same patch.
there are many more windows systems out there than  there are linux systems.
the bottom  line is that a user with admin privs can access kernel memory.
windows is not an option.
ah, if only i could get one how gratefully i would downgrade  myself to mere user!
perl is much more intelligent and moving from bash to perl has a learning curve  of less than an hour.
my experience is that linux is more securable than windows.
most of the mainstream distributions have had automatic updates for  years.
bah humbug friday, november 07, 2003 joel, what about your current development/production environment - microsoft software not run on lx: no vb, mysql, iis, etc.
that being said, linux is more capable of being secured - it's configuration is less opaque and kernel and user space are better segmented from each other.
now some drivers, video drivers, for example, have to access the  kernel, so i suppose it would be theoretically possible for a virus to install  a device driver which then accesses the kernel.
any system is only as  secure as the admin.
i go back, down the page, and start to install the full sql .exe.
>mandrake now (since 9.1 at least) has security  options for installation.
"correct me if i'm wrong (for i'm no  win32 expert), but would not a user mode application install have full access  to the registry" the registry has security controls on it, just  like the filesystem.
depends on which os the admin is familiar with, doesn't it?
no system can be provabily secure.
first and foremost - kernels are hacked, not higher layers of software.
when answering the  question "(why) is linux more secure than windows?"
there appears only  one place for programs to be installed in windows: the "/program  files" directory.
fw friday, november 07, 2003 security is a topic where there are no saints.
i'm not a linux guru, but using the documentation available, and the wonderful gentoo http://www.gentoo.org distribution, i can keep my system (on 24/7, on adsl) up and running and at least fairly secure.
it works the same the  other way around.
you can, however, use linux user mode from within such a machine: http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/uml.xml ) 2.
no system is secure when first installed.
similar solutions exist for other distributions.
at the same time, you have to acquire the needed applcations separately for  windows, which means that probably you also have to look for the patches at  different websites.
i do think your example is a bit specious.
but then i'm *used* to linux, i use linux at uni, and i use it at home.
as a unix programmer who avoids python at all costs myself, i can sympathize.
the installation is also quite easy with debian - two commands  issued on the command line.
laszlo marai friday, november 07, 2003 oh, and one more thing - i don't want to convince you about using debian, or linux, where i was trying to get at is that you might have had a hard time with linux, because you didn't use the right tool/distribution and yopu shouldn't judge based on those experiences.
bash is about running small, linkable applications to get specific tasks done.
if the  software is backed by simple 90s stack (webservermajor  languagedatabaseos) then i suppose going with you are  competent with.
bill gates latest "we don't supply firewalls, for that you will need to buy a firewall software" remark is bad, it is bad because it shows the utter lack of understanding of the nature of a hack.
its not, and should be disabled - especially when you're on the road, connecting to non-firewall protected networks.
beyond that, security on either system is obviously only as good as your  patching habits.
>choose "paranoid", and (whilst humming the black sabbath tune) >install away.
on the other hand in windows i would merely have had to click share connection and enable firewall and i'd have a moderately secure set up.
(*): let's don't forget, that when we refer to linux, we  usually mean a distribution, which contains all the software you need to run a  server (if you are luck enough - debian has more that 9000 software packages).
as far as i can tell using linux should be the best option for an internet server.
i  *feel* that my linux setup is more secure than a standard windows setup, but  the reverse would probably be true of an experienced windows user...
it's just very convenient to keep them all in one place.
philo philo friday, november 07, 2003 i've just been updating the laptop, as holiday time is coming up again.
security hotfixes are generally  available within a week of the announcement of the vulnerability, and  *obtaining* and installing a hotfix for windows is five mouse clicks (i just  counted - did an update while typing).
i think the  only os that can be called "inherently more secure" is openbsd, and  it accomplishes that by sacrificing a lot of functionality, which diminishes  the surface of attack.
if the shell isn't sufficient you can always use perl or python (or other languages) and generally the api integration is very good.
http://news.com.com/2100-7355_3-5103670.html?tag=nefd_top just watching friday, november 07, 2003 insightful?
if i am a virus writer, and you are a user without admin privs, the worst i should be able to do is infect/delete the files which you have access to.
i would have  thought.
and the development of the linux kernel is not done for profit, nor driven by stockholder expectations.
alyosha` friday, november 07, 2003 topical (cnet): an unknown intruder attempted to insert a trojan horse program into the code of the next version of the linux kernel, stored at a publicly accessible database ... only developers who used that database were affected--and only during a 24-hour period, he added.
what do i need for a dev machine on the intranet ?
love apache's mod_rewrite?
our  findings based on my fundamental premise: mysql on mac os x server is more  secure than sqlserver on windows 2000 server.
even if  windows is slightly more secure or securable (on a technical level) than linux,  the number of hackers writing exploits of windows security weaknesses makes me  think i'd be more secure on linux.
clearly *they* see  some inadequacy, real or perceived.
i think shell is used with a kind of "less is more" attitude.
so, my  claim here is more in the nature of an anti-claim: we cannot establish who's  the "most secure" by using a has-no-security bugs criteria.
a random debian developer, esteban manchado velÃ¡zquez friday, november 07, 2003 i would also suggest debian (or any other linux distribution with frequent security updates) if you wanted a (linux) system that is easy to keep update.
my post was to state that in my opinion,  linux is more "securable" (that is: better able to be secured) then  windows, not that it is more "secure" i base my opinion on my own  professional experience of administering significant numbers of systems of both  oses.
myron a. semack saturday, november 08, 2003 as someone who's used unix shells extensively, my perspective is that the  most important thing about the shell is that it's 1.
however, beyond the initial installation, *no* upgrade (barring the use of new kernel features) should require re-installation or downtime.
it's no differen than the /bin and /usr/bin directories in unix.
herbert sitz friday, november 07, 2003 > we can't agree that there's a difference between the  script-kiddie-launched, self-replicating, network-overflowing ms mail/web/sql  virus du jour and an obscure ssh flaw that has to be manually exploited on a  per-machine basis?
the answer is probably the only one that is free of  religious arguments and personal preferences.
also, windows is fully scriptable, just like unix.
bear in mind that we are talking about home and soho  machines here; anything in a company will be on a domain and running in user  mode.
in fact, you can totally automate the installation of security patches.
but there is insight into the process, there is peer-review,  and you can study the code (as if i would) if you want to.
this was based on the security issues and problems we had with another application that was (and sadly is) completely tied to windows server/iis and sqlserver.)
and that is good (at least, from a security  point of view).
in fact, they are  probably more tied to ms than any other oem.
debian comes by default configured to  install security updates, so if you tell a "stable" machine to  "apt-get update && apt-get upgrade" on a nightly basis, it  will get any new security updates and install them while you sleep.
stephen jones sunday, november 09, 2003 stephen, even though a device driver may not access the kernel,  there is nothing to prevent a driver from accessing the kernel.
both are great and i've seen whole applications written in jscript, but i think you have little idea about how powerful unix shell commands are.
unfortunately most distros (i'm certain of rh 7 thru  8) deliver x with tcp port 6000 open.
steve friday, november 07, 2003 i think you missed the point.
admin experience is a  significant factor in determining the appropriate platform to run the task at  hand.
if you run as a user all your important files are going to be  owned by that user, so a program could overwrite them anyway
dustin alexander monday, november 10, 2003 two things: 1.
we also see people talking about how much the ms  patches have to fix, but this is merely because a) it can find everything that  needs to be fixed, all at once, and b) many require reboots, and most people  would probably not enjoy multiple reboots.
under windows, this is very difficult, if not impossible to do.
i'm not a linux  guru, but using the documentation available, and the wonderful gentooÂ  http://www.gentoo.orgÂ  distribution, i can keep my system (on 24/7, on  adsl) up and running and at least fairly secure.
the  windows scripting host is a very powerful tool.
additionally, installing any software, not just user mode software becomes a priv'd task in windows.
anyone using debian security updates should read the dsas (debian security advisories) before upgrading, for at least two reasons: 1) you could find valuable information about the upgrade, as things to do before/after it.
for me, there's no question that it's the most secure option available.
i'd rather be on a different system (even if slightly  less secure) where there isn't as much efforts being devoted to hacking my  system.
makes one wonder a - if it has ever been  done before (if so it hasn't been detected) b - if something similar  has ever been done to windows (you'll never find out) friday, november 07, 2003 personally, i prefer linux, but i think that any admin worth their salt  will tell you the same thing about security: you have to keep up with patches  or your system will be compromised.
i mean a  server which supports a decent web server (apache), a nice db (oracle, mysql  etc.) , perl etc.
nat ersoz >> linux default installation is not* secure.
i have to wholeheartedly agree with those posting about  security being in the hands of the admin.
coupled with the task  scheduler (equivalent of cron), you have all the same automation tools  available to a unix admin.
that i can believe..... >
our findings based on my fundamental premise: mysql on mac os x server is more secure than sqlserver on windows 2000 server.
active directly has a very powerful approach to  security, which is considerably more granular than the simple ugo setup that  *nixes offer.
complexity is the number one opponent to security.
you can simply use runas, which works like sudo does under linux.
it seems to me that at least part of the question over which os is more secure is unrelated to how secure or securable each os is.
even windows update patches require more than two clicks, and then they usually require a reboot.
i upgrade regularly (using only "emerge sync" and "emerge system" or "emerge world" every other day, or if there's a patch that needs installing).
i don't care how much you patch.
but that is not enough!

there is nothing comparable in windows to the flexibiltiy of the command line in unix; by combining commands you can do pretty well everything, and there are more than thirty years of collected commands to play with.
however, in unix, /etc/ is fully protected from access by non-root access (which is all users 99% of the time - it takes a deliberate move to make yourself root).

windows does a lot of things that linux doesn't try to do (acls, for example), and if you need those features, there's no contest.
windows is a very, very complex platform to administer -  the simple interface masks a great deal of complexity, and creates the illusion  of ease of use.
" obviously  not a windows admin.
additionally, installing any software, not just user mode software becomes  a priv'd task in windows.

not so when  you are admin, you can easily and unknowingly destory the entire system.

bill gates thinks security is not an os's responsibility; instead, users (who don't know the difference between a real error message and a web page designed to look like one) should set up and properly configure firewalls, as well as regularly install multi-mb patches over a dialup line.
and i'm not paying any windows taxes while doing so.
and you don't even have to log out to do it.
the answer is probably the only one that is free of religious arguments and personal preferences.
you certainly shouldn't run as administrator with a dsl or cable connection -
we also cannot establish it by using the  severity of bugs.
realistically, once a week is about as much as anyone can keep up with.
if however, you're running as admin, i can install a simple device driver which allows me to map any physical page, read/write any device, and delete any file.
in fact, you can totally automate the  installation of security patches.

there is much more harm it can do in rewriting the registry or the file system or whatever.

the problem with this approach is that it gets  users comfortable with the idea of entering their administrator password  whenever something asks for it.

meanwhile in this time there  have been a dozen updates to a dozen different programs in a generic linux  system.
they're very faithful--they have  rarely dealt with a non-ms os (partially because, unlike hp, compaq, and ibm,  they don't have their own in-house os) and they have not jumped onto the linux  bandwagon nearly as loudly as others.
can't be feaures--the linux site comes with mysql and the ms one doesn't have any database at all, not even access.
historically, most attacks  come months after the original patch is released, so if you can keep up to the  patch schedule your risk is low enough.

nat ersoz sunday, november 09, 2003 joel, in regard to your comment about two clicks to securing the windows  system: in many linux distributions (such as debian or mandrake), you can  automatically install updates from the command line, (or even from a  graphical utility).
osx does  something similar.
you will have to define what windows is, and what linux is.
i have been using the same installed image continuously for almost 5 years now, and i've twice duplicated the system by copying the drive onto another machine and tweaking a few system settings, then upgrading or installing new packages.
yes, windows can be maintained by remote gui desktops - but again, it goes one at a time.
the unix admin maintains cron jobs on his users' computers which poll for updates and install when necessary.
the os is secure as well.
vb sript and jscript were not written with sysadmins in mind.
using  the system accounts, it's possible.
not in any kind of corporate environment, anyway.
certainly, bash is a stripped down language  for automating common tasks, but that is what it was designed for.
this was based  on the security issues and problems we had with another application that was  (and sadly is) completely tied to windows server/iis and sqlserver.)
admin privs are  compromisedÂ  when users run as admin as a matter of fact.
bourne shell lacks both structures and arrays.
clearly *they* see some inadequacy, real or perceived.
and  i'm not paying any windows taxes while doing so.
windows is a very, very complex platform to administer - the simple interface masks a great deal of complexity, and creates the illusion of ease of use.
and yes, i do realize that there are plenty of hackers trying to exploit linux,  too.
coupled with the task scheduler (equivalent of cron), you have all the same automation tools available to a unix admin.
although there may be no known  holes in xfree at the moment, x is too huge (and i consider myself rather  knowledgeable about x's low level and internals) to be certain that leaving the  tcp port open is a good idea.
but  it takes you 15 minutes to figure the same thing out in vb.net..
the fact that it comes from a unix design heritage (as opposed to the desktop single-user model that windows has evolved from) leads to much better system administration tools and practices.
on a linux system, you shouldn't be logged in as  root 24/7 because one typo can bring a system crashing to a halt.
a user-mode process under windows can't touch kernel memory, even if it is running as administrator.
you mix that with the project limitations and you should get something  figured out.
" secue as in  100% secure is an unobtainable dream, but some default installs are more secure  than others.
why realplayer and quicktime can "steal" the file associations at will?
we host the database on mysql on mac os x, while we host the frontend on windows.
i think some of us here are too quick to make fun of  wayne.
as for automatic update  services, i'd have to seriously question a sysadmin who allowed automatic  updates on their server.
that is the worst and most exploited of all windows security sins.
it's their computer, and they can do whatever they want.
remember, linux is just a kernel, most problems they are counting are in the  userland, should i count one for windows if i make a c program that uses strcpy  for input and i can overflow the stack?
now one  suggestion that's been made over and over again is "why not keep user  accounts running as regular users, and have it ask for the admin password when  they want to do something like install software?".
portabella sunday, november 09, 2003
note: not all ports are open, only the ones which were opted for  (mostly).
base your decisions on the facts at hand, rather than os religion.
the fundamental problem with windows security is that users are accustomed to running administrator privs 100% of the time.
i have made a lot of money with perl  over the years.
remember, linux is just a kernel, most problems they are counting are in the userland, should i count one for windows if i make a c program that uses strcpy for input and i can overflow the stack?
if linux is as secure/securable or more secure/securable than windows, that simply tilts the decision even more in favor of linux.
if you want something more sophisticated, there are tools like altiris.
after half  an hour i check to find that the button called install has taken me to a page  which tells me i'm on the wrong ms site and has a link to another sql page.
on a corporate network, windows is hardly remotely adminstratable.
stephen jones sunday, november 09, 2003 stephen, even though a device driver may not access the kernel, there is nothing to prevent a driver from accessing the kernel.
i have been on (and led) project teams that built enterprise server  applications in perl.
(an aside: this reflects our  usage of fogbugz.
there is no differentiation between a user installing a pure user mode application and a device driver
and although it's nice to be able to use perl on windows to  drive com objects, i confess that i usually prototype my automation scripts in  vbscript, and then port them to perl once they're working.
under windows, this is very difficult, if not impossible to  do.
running in user mode, or using the compatibility template if absolutely necessary, would stop some viruses from installing, but as has been said, in a corporate network everybody is normally running as a user with limited rights.
but i very much doubt that their efforts amount to even a small fraction of the efforts being devoted to hacking windows.
and the answers are: 1.
computer security is really the act of progressively  raising the bar to protect the system from compromise.
system setting remain consistent, and can only be changed by root.
this is a tough call, using windows server in an intranet is pretty nice and fluent as long as you don't try the wacky stuff (workgroup + domains + iis + apache + ms directory + other file sharing techniques), installing linux requires knowledge but read point 3 and you'll see linux is your only option anyway... 3.
i  then go back, and read more carefully; for the fun of it i click on the link i  got the error message on before and this time it takes me to the right page.
can you find someone to make time to read a good book on isa server/checkpoint and a good book on windows internals?
interestingly, the linux developers resist, tooth-and-nail, attempts to move to a higher-level language like python.
security is a process, not a product.
our experience is this:  we have two server plaforms in our company that are similar to your situation;  sqlserver on windows 2000 server and mysql on mac os x server.
i  believe this is the only rationale that will convince you that system ____ is  more secure than windows.
ssh is the only  exposed port which should be allowed open when running outside a firewall.
using the system accounts, it's possible.
the netbios port was intentionally turned on (samba to allow for smb sharing),but should also be turned off when running in the open.
so no matter how malicous or poorly designed the program, if the os integrity is intact, then no user mode application can corrupt /etc/.
if you run as a user all your important files are going to be owned by that user, so a program could overwrite them anyway
these systems are in a constant flow of change and highly configurable, and it only takes 1 "insecurity" to make the system as a whole vulnerable, so when you finally finish defining what you mean by "windows" and by "linux" and ask the "why..?
osx does something similar.
a base installation of debian,  for example, simple won't contain x or the numerous security-hole-prone  services that are installed by default in windows and the  "recommended" installations of some of the desktop distributions of  linux.
the more secure of linux and windows would have to be linux, hands down -  if you've chosen an appropriate distribution of linux, and haven't decided to  install every single available software package.
redhat has the  same.
before i discovered  wsh, i though there was no real scripting solution for windows (without a third  party).
tell me why here, and use the other topic for talking about what i  asked about.
there is nothing in linux that makes it  inherently better (or inherently worse) than windows.
but every time i release perl code to production, it scares the hell out of me (because perl syntax is so abstruse that it's hard to know what remaining bugs may lurk).
for that very reason i've chosen openbsd to power my server.
i  use linux,Â  i use it on my two desktops and my router / webserver  etc.Â  for me,Â  there's no question that it's the most secure option  available.
i do my desktop computing on windows boxes.
there is nothing  comparable in windows to the flexibiltiy of the command line in unix; by  combining commands you can do pretty well everything, and there are more than  thirty years of collected commands to play with.
if you buy windows, whatever version, you put your trust in a huge corporation, with internal conflicts and decisions taken for political reasons, or to please stockholders, instead of for technical reasons.
now compare that with windows: you download the  patch for a certain application for the website of the vendor(*) using a  browser, then you click on the icon, then a gui starts, then you click  'next>>' a few times, and in the end you most probably have to restart  (or not).
i suppose you might have used a source distribution of openssh, but one would  have to wonder why if you don't apparently have the confidence (or possibly  skills) to administer such things.
if you buy  windows, whatever version, you put your trust in a huge corporation, with  internal conflicts and decisions taken for political reasons, or to please  stockholders, instead of for technical reasons.
and this because the usability of windows has not followed the same clean design as the kernel was given.
i abort the other installation and click on the other link which then starts the 11mb download, which it appears doesn't actually check if you have anything that needs patching until you have downloaded the same patch.
web forums aren't really going to answer the question, there's the odd whackjob who equates linux and mozilla with the apocalypse (see most linux posts here, there's always someone).
and the  answers are: 1.
ms would never make the  same mistake twice.
oh, and windows or more popular, and thus a more "profitable" target for any hackers/script kiddies out there.
security hotfixes are generally available within a week of the announcement of the vulnerability, and *obtaining* and installing a hotfix for windows is five mouse clicks (i just counted - did an update while typing).
http://www.dellhost.com/dhproduct/overview.aspx?segment=dedicated&category=web&sku=d2800 why would they offer yet another platform to maintain at a *lower* cost?
those immediately after blaster, et al) with hoards of linux evangelists using it as an example of poor windows security, even though ms had a patch out before the incident...
essentially, if you  need a server and aren't going to limit yourself to ms-only products - do  yourself a favour and have a look at the bsds and not only linux.
if i  am a virus writer, and you are a user without admin privs, the worst i should  be able to do is infect/delete the files which you have access to.
ssh is the only exposed port which should be allowed open when running outside a firewall.
it's only a matter of time beofre someone  makes an application that looks just like the "enter admin password"  dialog, and then you'd have a whole new class of security breaches.
it just doesn't matter what os  you've got.
with debian, the announced security holes are fixed typically in a few (usually 1) day after the patch is available.
windows does a lot of things that linux doesn't try to do  (acls, for example), and if you need those features, there's no contest.
any system is only as secure as the admin.
a user-mode process under windows  can't touch kernel memory, even if it is running as administrator.
security is an ever moving target, and no operating system is secure if  the os hasn't been patched properly, or if passwords aren't protected properly.
the  netbios port was intentionally turned on (samba to allow for smb sharing),but
they aren't interested in making a point about os superiority, they just want to make as much as they can from whatever product they sell.
the question is: how do you make that  maintenance cost low?
i'd rather be on a different system (even if slightly less secure) where there isn't as much efforts being devoted to hacking my system.
the badger wednesday, december 10, 2003 it does not take four hours of messing around with source to patch an ssh vulnerability.
the more secure of linux and windows would have to be linux, hands down - if you've chosen an appropriate distribution of linux, and haven't decided to install every single available software package.
but  then i'm *used* to linux, i use linux at uni, and i use it at home.
hackers devote more resources to hacing windows.
ok, default installation of redhat gives some basic firewall rules: close* all ports, open some* ports, open all* ports.
as for what users can access in their os, it again falls in the hands of the admin.
wednesday is patch day at microsoft, and there are  new "critical" security patches to apply every week, along with many  others.
other services can be enabled, ftp server, http server, etc.
if you are maintaining more than one or two computers, this gets old very fast, especially since every patch needs to be researched and tested to make sure it doesn't break mission-critical software x.
what do i need  for a dev machine on the intranet ?
that  the install isa breeze and comes with almost everything i need and nothing more  than that (no, not 1005 pointless image viewers, not 567 text editors, not 382  window managers, and not 47 implementations of ping) is a huge plus as far as  i'm concerned.
so, linux (or other open source maintained distributions like openbsd) is the way to go, it has plenty of virtues (open source, good community, fast response, good track record, don't undermine the user).
security is an ever moving target, and no operating system is secure if the os hasn't been patched properly, or if passwords aren't protected properly.
so in my opinion, it really  depends on where your competence rest.
while you still have to wait for the update to  become available, it is usually shorter than the windows update becomes  available.
admins can control this to very specific rights in just about any os i'm aware of.
personally, i think linux is an excellent server platform that will continue to eat unix's lunch and continue to threaten windows' dominance.
but most of the time the high level hacks, the ones which do actual damage are kernel level hacks (offcourse you can always argue that by not securing the kernel this becomes a user land problem but that would require all different apps to try and stop the same malicious source, which is stupid).
before i discovered wsh, i though there was no real scripting solution for windows (without a third party).
ok, default installation of redhat gives some basic firewall  rules: close* all ports, open some* ports, open all* ports.
i do think your example is a bit  specious.
nat ersoz friday, november 07, 2003 to preface my comment, i should say that i don't really have much technical  knowledge of security issues in linux and windows.
however, beyond the initial installation, *no* upgrade (barring  the use of new kernel features)
joel: if you want to administer a linux server without having to mess around with the usual garbage associated with re-compiling and re-installing system services, might i recommend http://www.debian.org/ ?
we  could argue the neither setup is very secure (i'm not a network guru)...
wsh gives you an amazing amount of flexibility.
with debian, the announced security holes are fixed typically in a few (usually  1) day after the patch is available.
they represent thirty years of experience doing  things with unix systems.
you can hardly fault sed for not allowing access to the networking stack.
as for automatic update services, i'd have to seriously question a sysadmin who allowed automatic updates on their server.
it works the same the other way around.
trevor b saturday, november 15, 2003 when comparing linux with windows as a secure server, you shouldn't use a  desktop distribution of linux such as mandrake or redhat as the point of  comparison on the linux side.
we also  cannot establish it by using the severity of bugs.
once enabled, just being administrator is not sufficient to execute any program.
the same concept is now part of windows 2003 and  xp professional under software permissions policy.
glyph lefkowitz friday, november 07, 2003 cool, a joel-troll!
as an added bonus, i won't show up in the process list  when a user hits ctrl-altdel for the taskman.
stephen jones sunday, november 09, 2003 > unix programmers refuse to move to higher level languages because of stubbornness.
"on a corporate network, windows is  hardly remotely adminstratable.
security is a topic where there are no saints.
the  religious flame war about system security is kind of funny to watch  though.
a user running as admin can install a device driver, and then access whatever they like through a user mode app which accesses the newly installed driver.
i've gotta side with the folks that say security depends on the  quality of the admin.
you certainly shouldn't run as administrator with a dsl or cable  connection -
wednesday is patch day at microsoft, and there are new "critical" security patches to apply every week, along with many others.
i didn't mean that there were no differences at  all, security-wise...
but it takes you 15 minutes to figure the same thing out in vb.net..
you will have to  define what windows is, and what linux is.
"is linux more secure than windows?" is a nonsensical question.
it seems to be the case that more hackers write viruses/worms/etc. to attack windows systems than to attack linux systems.
in a home environment, most user's run as  administrator, and rightly so.
i think any arguments against the bash have to be weighted down due to the  ubiquitous availability of much more robust alternatives such as perl from the  linux command line.
this is a "usability enhancement" which allows users to install any/all programs without performnig the pesky task of swithing from "my account" to admin, over and over, when you want to install software.
since security is a hot topic, though, there will be all kinds of political arguments over the proper way to count :)
now one suggestion that's been made over and over again is "why not keep user accounts running as regular users, and have it ask for the admin password when they want to do something like install software?".
use whatever you are happy with.m fw friday, november 07, 2003 "no system is secure when first installed.
" gotta call bullshit here.
bear in mind that we are talking about home and soho machines here; anything in a company will be on a domain and running in user mode.
in practice, however, i have never seen a security update fail.)
yes,  linux (and some of the other free *nix dialects) are also developed by big  groups of people.
but the install and config should be specific to a server dedicated to that purpose.
wayne earl friday, november 07, 2003 that was an insightful, reasoned, and fair treatment of the two operating systems.

wisdom  or stupidity?
correct me if i'm wrong (for i'm no win32 expert), but would not a user mode application install have full access to the registry, able to wipe it clean if the app were malicious or poorly designed?
and that is good (at least, from a security point of view).

yes, windows can be  maintained by remote gui desktops - but again, it goes one at a time.
friday, november 07, 2003 just a note about debian security updates: glyph, you say you can  totally automate security updates.
anyway, anybody can quote numbers until the cows come home.
i'd like to address you to excellent book

stuff i  can do in 2 seconds in any high-level development language is tedious and  difficult in shell.
in joel's case, if he has to personally  admin the system, then windows is almost always the correct choice, simply  because of his level of expertise with the platform.
myron a. semack friday, november 07, 2003 i don't think that 'more secure' is even a question you can answer.
> >of which distribution?
which regex engines do you know best?
3 paragraphs of fanboyism without a single fact to back up a word he says?
i think the only os that can be called "inherently more secure" is openbsd, and it accomplishes that by sacrificing a lot of functionality, which diminishes the surface of attack.
its not, and should be disabled -  especially when you're on the road, connecting to non-firewall protected  networks.
and perl makes any scripting language commonly  available on windows appear laughable.
"building secure servers with linux" by michael d. bauer.
perl is much more intelligent and moving from bash to perl has a learning curve of less than an hour.
but i very much doubt that their efforts amount to even a small  fraction of the efforts being devoted to hacking windows.
in a home environment, most user's run as administrator, and rightly so.
active directly has a very powerful approach to security, which is considerably more granular than the simple ugo setup that *nixes offer.
if it takes you n hours to figure out how to get perl to filter out malicious sql text out of dynamically created insert strings.
it's not  just a glorified batch file (ala unix shells).

it's quicker that way.
you can  hardly fault sed for not allowing access to the networking stack.
the fundamental problem with windows security is that  users are accustomed to running administrator privs 100% of the time.
we host the database on mysql on mac os x, while we host the  frontend on windows.
it's just very convenient to keep  them all in one place.
so, my claim here is more in the nature of an anti-claim: we cannot establish who's the "most secure" by using a has-no-security bugs criteria.

i think some of us here are too quick to make fun of wayne.
that is why i'm not running anything under windows at home.
you know the windows admin,  because he carries cd's and floppies around from desk to desk, installing or  upgrading software.
there are many more windows systems out there than there are linux systems.
you can have ports off, and kernels patched and users rights allowing them to do nothing but run text editors, and still someone will find a way to do something they shouldn't be doing.
i upgrade regularly (using  only "emerge sync" and "emerge system" or "emerge  world" every other day, or if there's a patch that needs installing).
of course, if you've got expertise with windows and don't know (or want to know) how to do things the unix way, then you might be better off sticking with windows.
the badger wednesday, december 10, 2003 it does not take four hours of messing around with source to patch an ssh  vulnerability.
some of this is because you have a lot of very experienced programmers with a massive investment in c. i don't have this same massive investment of ten to twenty years, but i have to confess that i keep making a heavier investment because i haven't found anything that offers me as much capability or flexibility.
the bottom line is that a user with admin privs can access kernel memory.
i/o driver - a bit of a sledgehammer to crack a nut.
reading security advisories makes you learn about your system.
:-) wayne earl friday, november 07, 2003 just watching - yeah.
if the difference is only "that someone hasn't done  that yet", then the claim of better security is on pretty shaky ground.
i can say that linux is demonstratibly more stable a platform than windows, and i say this with far, far more windows admin experience than linux experience.
we also see people talking about how much the ms patches have to fix, but this is merely because a) it can find everything that needs to be fixed, all at once, and b) many require reboots, and most people would probably not enjoy multiple reboots.

my post was to state that in my opinion, linux is more "securable" (that is: better able to be secured) then windows, not that it is more "secure" i base my opinion on my own professional experience of administering significant numbers of systems of both oses.
if the kernel is secure (see "good netfilter/iptables config" pseudo entry in any faq)
correct me if i'm wrong (for i'm no win32  expert), but would not a user mode application install have full access to the  registry, able to wipe it clean if the app were malicious or poorly  designed?
historically, most attacks come months after the original patch is released, so if you can keep up to the patch schedule your risk is low enough.
joel: if you want to administer a linux server  without having to mess around with the usual garbage associated with  re-compiling and re-installing system services, might i recommend http://www.debian.org/ ?
the heart of unix security and win32 security exists in  the fact that kernel space can only be accessed by root or administrator  authorization.

portabella saturday, november 08, 2003 wsh lets you use vb script or jscript.
now, to install an application that has  sytem-wide effects, you do have to run it as administrator (no different than  linux).
this box should be hardened, if running in "the  wild", by turning off x11's tcp connection (flag -nolisten tcp).
the installation is also quite easy with debian - two commands issued on the command line.
this topic is a preemptive haven for people whose immediate reaction when  asked how to build a reliable windows server is "use linux."
if the administrator is on-the-ball, you're os is as secure  as it can be... ...until the next hack or virus comes out, that is.
as for what users can access  in their os, it again falls in the hands of the admin.
while theoretically possible, it is practically  not feasible, to remotely admin windows boxes.
the problem with this approach is that it gets users comfortable with the idea of entering their administrator password whenever something asks for it.

"is linux more secure than windows?" is a  nonsensical question.
they're very faithful--they have rarely dealt with a non-ms os (partially because, unlike hp, compaq, and ibm, they don't have their own in-house os) and they have not jumped onto the linux bandwagon nearly as loudly as others.
and i agree with a previous poster that a security bug *count* is probably the best way of establishing the differences.
a user-mode  process under windows can't touch kernel memory, even if it is running as  administrator.
what i  do know is that i do not like to put trust in a single vendor.
i don't know whether this is because there are many  more windows systems (and so more havoc for the hacker to wreak) or because the  windows systems are made by microsoft (and more hackers are ms haters).
with linux, you can strip the system down, so that it does one thing  and one thing only.
admin experience is a significant factor in determining the appropriate platform to run the task at hand.
maybe you happen to know vbscript's regexp engine inside and out and happen to know how to work around the issues better than you know perl's.

the unix analogy is the /etc/ directory  (much maligned by windows devs/users).
bill  gates thinks security is not an os's responsibility; instead, users (who don't  know the difference between a real error message and a web page designed to  look like one) should set up and properly configure firewalls, as well as  regularly install multi-mb patches over a dialup line.

how do you do that properly with asp.net and iis6?

it's not just that there are hundreds of pages of them; it's the fact that you can combine them to pretty well do anything you want.
they aren't interested in making a point about os superiority, they just want  to make as much as they can from whatever product they sell.

the code needs to provide evidence of its source, either particular path, registry key, signature, etc. kunal tuesday, november 25, 2003 i don't know about the real security of windows vs linux.

nat ersoz sunday, november 09, 2003 joel, in regard to your comment about two clicks to securing the windows system: in many linux distributions (such as debian or mandrake), you can automatically install updates from the command line, (or even from a graphical utility).
most of the mainstream distributions have had automatic updates for years.
under linux, i can raise the bar higher, making compromise  much more difficult, in less time, with less effort, and less cost than under  windows.
if you want a really secure system, you're probably best off selecting either openbsd or one of the linux distributions that are working on security above all other considerations.
of which  distribution?
you're just asking for trouble.
i don't know whether this is because there are many more windows systems (and so more havoc for the hacker to wreak) or because the windows systems are made by microsoft (and more hackers are ms haters).
perl on unix, in the hands of a guru, is a very powerful tool  indeed.
under debian, a simple apt-get update; apt-get upgrade ssh will suffice.
nobody will actually tell you  why, but you will still get a million answers, and the most usable answer will  probably be: don't ask!
as a unix programmer who avoids python  at all costs myself, i can sympathize.
there is no  differentiation between a user installing a pure user mode application and a  device driverÂ  no matter how malicious the intent of a user mode app, if  the os is secure and intact, the user mode app can only affect the user that  installed the program and the file which he has access to.

out of the box, windows xp gives you only 2  options:Â  the user is admin (can do everything, all the time), or the user  is a moron (cannont install anything at any time).
> linux default installation is not* secure.
but then again, remmember that  using linux requires lots of hours learning, tweaking and understanding what  you are doing while with windows its all point and click (you can never know  what this point and clicks end you up with, but thats good old ms)
windows hotfixes come out every few weeks.
although there may be no known holes in xfree at the moment, x is too huge (and i consider myself rather knowledgeable about x's low level and internals) to be certain that leaving the tcp port open is a good idea.
now copmare that with windows: 2-3 sp/year?
of all these, the fundamental problem of windows security is that all users run  as admin all of the time.
mandrake now (since 9.1 at least) has security options  for installation.
if you are maintaining more than one or two computers, this  gets old very fast, especially since every patch needs to be researched and  tested to make sure it doesn't break mission-critical software x.Â   realistically, once a week is about as much as anyone can keep up with.
not in any kind of corporate  environment, anyway.
but i take a long term view, and i  realise that it's all a matter of personal preference.

i think shell is used with a kind of "less  is more" attitude.
(an aside: this reflects our usage of fogbugz.

is linux more secure than windows?
but you can't log in as system.
the real question is not how many sps and/or patches are released per year, but how many vulnerabilities are discovered per year.
this is *only* because: 1) i've used linux for a long time and am familiar with updating and hardening it.
beyond that, security on either system is obviously only as good as your patching habits.
friday, november 07, 2003 actual counts of security issues and the severity of each issue is my empricial basis for stating that one system is more secure than another.
the religious flame war about system security is kind of funny to watch though.
and yes, i'm working for a  quite large (high-tech) corporation, smaller than microsoft.
last time a flaw was discovered in openssh, red hat network carried a fix and up2date had it patched within minutes of me ticking the box.

at the same time, you have to acquire the needed applcations separately for windows, which means that probably you also have to look for the patches at different websites.
choose "paranoid", and (whilst humming the black sabbath tune) install away.
it seems to be the case that more hackers  write viruses/worms/etc. to attack windows systems than to attack linux  systems.
to download the msde security patch i first of  all have to go from windows update to office update, then install everything  else, reboot, and then go to windows update and office update as well.
this means that on the avarage you'll have a patch in 2-4  days after a bug has been announced.
as all it could probably do would to to blue screen the machine i don't see the point.
if  however, you're running as admin, i can install a simple device driver which  allows me to map any physical page, read/write any device, and delete any  file.
the real question is not how  many sps and/or patches are released per year, but how many vulnerabilities are  discovered per year.
if the kernel is secure (see "good netfilter/iptables  config" pseudo entry in any faq)
keeping it secure requires keeping the system up to  date and watching what's going on, just like any other system.
this topic is a preemptive haven for people whose immediate reaction when asked how to build a reliable windows server is "use linux."
and perl makes any scripting language commonly available on windows appear laughable.
being vulnerable for a week is not the end of the world - and applying a patch that's going to break things is much worse.
2) i've not really used windows in a 'hostile' environment.
and this because the usability of windows has not  followed the same clean design as the kernel was given.
", you will get answers that will include new vulnerabilities and new patches that emerged after your definition was completed.
stephen jones saturday, november 08, 2003 portabella, unix programmers refuse to move to higher level  languages because of stubbornness.
while win32 maintains a very robust kernel and chacl capability, the security  is almost universally overridden by the default installation of assining all  users as admin.
to be vunerable for a week?
in the end, though, i don't even think the reason matters.
if you want a really secure system, you're probably best off  selecting either openbsd or one of the linux distributions that are working on  security above all other considerations.
the unix analogy is the /etc/ directory (much maligned by windows devs/users).
each type of system has it's place - use the one most appropriate for the  particular problem you are facing.
li-fan chen friday, november 07, 2003 look, userland and kernel are different.
can you find someone to make time to read a good book on isa  server/checkpoint and a good book on windows internals?
while win32 maintains a very robust kernel and chacl capability, the security is almost universally overridden by the default installation of assining all users as admin.
stuff i can do in 2 seconds in any high-level development language is tedious and difficult in shell.
keeping it secure requires keeping the system up to date and watching what's going on, just like any other system.
we could argue the neither setup is very secure (i'm not a network guru)...
can't be feaures--the linux site comes with mysql and the ms one doesn't have  any database at all, not even access.
makes one wonder a - if it has ever been done before (if so it hasn't been detected) b - if something similar has ever been done to windows (you'll never find out) friday, november 07, 2003 personally, i prefer linux, but i think that any admin worth their salt will tell you the same thing about security: you have to keep up with patches or your system will be compromised.
clutch cargo friday, november 07, 2003 security is a process, not a product.
but i take a long term view, and i realise that it's all a matter of personal preference.
what i do know is that i do not like to put trust in a single vendor.
it probably takes the same 15 minutes to translate the regex, but can you determine for sure the behavior of your perl's regex in the face of other (like ones that forces your regex engine to hang itself parsing forever) attacks?
>choose "paranoid", and (whilst  humming theÂ  black sabbath tune) >install away.
this is a tough call, using  windows server in an intranet is pretty nice and fluent as long as you don't  try the wacky stuff (workgroup + domains + iis + apache + ms directory + other  file sharing techniques), installing linux requires knowledge but read point 3  and you'll see linux is your only option anyway... 3.
your system administrator can create very secure linux.
"correct me if i'm wrong (for i'm no win32 expert), but would not a user mode application install have full access to the registry" the registry has security controls on it, just like the filesystem.
what should i use for an internet server ?
in joel's case, if he has to personally admin the system, then windows is almost always the correct choice, simply because of his level of expertise with the platform.
that the install isa breeze and comes with almost everything i need and nothing more than that (no, not 1005 pointless image viewers, not 567 text editors, not 382 window managers, and not 47 implementations of ping) is a huge plus as far as i'm concerned.
what's stopping someone from automating the ssh flaw and distributing it to script kiddies?
to the best of my knowledge you are dealing with a ring system.
certainly, bash is a stripped down language for automating common tasks, but that is what it was designed for.
now, to install an application that has sytem-wide effects, you do have to run it as administrator (no different than linux).
base your decisions on the facts at hand,  rather than os religion.
admins can control  this to very specific rights in just about any os i'm aware of.
then  there's the other extreme who call all windows users idiots (see everything  ever written on slashdot).
now i've seen everything!
but i'm sure they've got that all worked out now.
mandrake now (since 9.1 at least) has security options for installation.
they're also very monogomous; note that they're the only major oem that has *never* shipped an amd system.
is this a delayed message from  1996?
with linux, you can strip the system down, so that it does one thing and one thing only.
we also use mysql replication and it works very well.
vb sript and jscript were not written with sysadmins  in mind.
you can probably delete any file without touching the kernel, since admin normally owns the whole machine.
if you want something more sophisticated, there are tools like  altiris.
with windows, you always rely on microsoft to provide the update, while on linux you have a choice to circumvent the vendor, and install the package from the source before it is available from the vendor.
by default neither system is anymore or less secure, they  each different approaches to security, which leads them open to different  problems.
if the software is backed by simple 90s stack (webservermajor languagedatabaseos) then i suppose going with you are competent with.
to download the msde security patch i first of all have to go from windows update to office update, then install everything else, reboot, and then go to windows update and office update as well.
as all it could probably do  would to to blue screen the machine i don't see the point.
an admirer of openbsd's security audits but  uses windows?
stephen jones > unix programmers refuse to move to higher level languages because of  stubbornness.
you can use gpo's to  manage the registry of client machines (inlcuding grabbing updates from a  network).
the unix admin maintains cron jobs on his users'  computers which poll for updates and install when necessary.
unix, out of the box, provides a well defined multiuser environment which provides a well defined context with respect to who can install device drivers, who can change permissions, and who has access to what.
it's not just a glorified batch file (ala unix shells).
and you find this acceptable?
a base installation of debian, for example, simple won't contain x or the numerous security-hole-prone services that are installed by default in windows and the "recommended" installations of some of the desktop distributions of linux.
the caveat is that the system can be  quite difficult to install initially, especially if you have esoteric  hardware.
of which distribution?
--oliver oliver hunt wednesday, november 12, 2003 come on people, haven't we learned by now that the least "secure"  os is the one with the latest hack or virus headline.

the heart of unix security and win32 security exists in the fact that kernel space can only be accessed by root or administrator authorization.
i can say that linux is demonstratibly more stable a platform than  windows, and i say this with far, far more windows admin experience than linux  experience.
i have been using the same installed image continuously for  almost 5 years now, and i've twice duplicated the system by copying the drive  onto another machine and tweaking a few system settings, then upgrading or  installing new packages.
other services can be enabled, ftp server, http server, etc.Â  but the  install and config should be specific to a server dedicated to that purpose.
and i trust linus torvalds, and the people he's chosen.

(up until last time i checked; don't know if they're doing or will do any opteron stuff.)
as far as i can  tell using linux should be the best option for an internet server.
there is nothing in linux that makes it inherently better (or inherently worse) than windows.
it's downright amazing.
you can, however,  use linux user mode from within such a machine: http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/uml.xml )
so, linux (or  other open source maintained distributions like openbsd) is the way to go, it  has plenty of virtues (open source, good community, fast response, good track
true, from time to time a "cultural hack" is found, like the i love you letter
you know the windows admin, because he carries cd's and floppies around from desk to desk, installing or upgrading software.
unix, out of the box, provides a well defined multiuser  environment which provides a well defined context with respect to who can  install device drivers, who can change permissions, and who has access to  what.
that iÂ  can believe..... > i  have to confess that i keep making a heavier investment because i haven't found  anything that offers me as much capability or flexibility.
computer security is really the act of progressively raising the bar to protect the system from compromise.
no system can be  provabily secure.
admin privs are compromised when users run as admin as a matter of fact.
now compare that with windows: you download the patch for a certain application for the website of the vendor(*) using a browser, then you click on the icon, then a gui starts, then you click 'next>>' a few times, and in the end you most probably have to restart (or not).
sometimes you have to restart some service linking to an  updated library, or you have to check something.
i admit that most of the times  you have to do nothing, but anyway...
interestingly, the linux developers resist,  tooth-and-nail, attempts to move to a higher-level language like python.
that is, for an admin to maintain blocks of machines, all amdin tasks must be made through gui manipulation.
it's only a matter of time beofre someone makes an application that looks just like the "enter admin password" dialog, and then you'd have a whole new class of security breaches.
i *feel* that my linux setup is more secure than a standard windows setup, but the reverse would probably be true of an experienced windows user...
anyway, anybody can quote  numbers until the cows come home.
each type of system has it's place - use the one most appropriate for the particular problem you are facing.

while theoretically possible, it is practically not feasible, to remotely admin windows boxes.
alyosha` friday, november 07, 2003 topical (cnet): an unknown intruder attempted to insert a trojan  horse program into the code of the next version of the linux kernel, stored at  a publicly accessible database ... only developers who used that database were  affected--and only during a 24-hour period, he added.
having said all that, microsoft's shoddy client software has ruined email, i'm sick to death of those damned 400k virus attachments filling up my mailbox.
eh, no reason to, i guess.
but there is insight into the process, there is peer-review, and you can study the code (as if i would) if you want to.
how do you do that with postgres?
an admirer of openbsd's security audits but uses windows?
on a linux system, you shouldn't be logged in as root 24/7 because one typo can bring a system crashing to a halt.
first and foremost - kernels are hacked, not higher layers of  software.
true, from time  to time a "cultural hack" is found, like the i love you letter
that is the worst and most exploited of all  windows security sins.
joel spolsky friday, november 07, 2003 os-religion issues aside, as someone who worked as a sysadmin for close to  10 years, and works with both linux and windows servers on a daily basis, i  would say that neither is more secure than the other, "out of the  box".
wayne earl that was an insightful, reasoned, and fair treatment of the two operating  systems.
so the short answer to "(why) is linux more secure than linux" is: don't ask!
bullet-proof it's *not* very high-level, but "glorified batch file" is manifestly wrong.
there are various links on that page and i click on the likely one.
to do this in kernel mode you would presumably have to write an alternative
since  security is a hot topic, though, there will be all kinds of political arguments  over the proper way to count :)
however, in unix, /etc/ is fully  protected from access by non-root access (which is all users 99% of the time -  it takes a deliberate move to make yourself root).
the same concept is now part of windows 2003 and xp professional under software permissions policy.
yes, linux (and some of the other free *nix dialects) are also developed by big groups of people.
if everybody was to count the  number of problems on anything that ran windows, that would be different.
anyone using debian security  updates should read the dsas (debian security advisories) before upgrading, for  at least two reasons: 1) you could find valuable information about  the upgrade, as things to do before/after it.
debian comes by default configured to install security updates, so if you tell a "stable" machine to "apt-get update && apt-get upgrade" on a nightly basis, it will get any new security updates and install them while you sleep.
if everybody was to count the number of problems on anything that ran windows, that would be different.
the windows scripting host is a very powerful tool.
