all systems are vulnerable to security issues, however it's important to note that linux uses the same security model as the original unix implementations- a model that was not designed from the ground up to be secure.administrators cannot delegate administrative privileges: a user who needs any administrative capability must be made a full administrator, which compromises best security practices.a user would end up with a system that has fewer applications, is more complex to use and manage, and is less intuitive.delivering a scalable system is a complex task and it's not clear that the linux community can solve these issues easily or quickly.2.2 delivered quite a few improvements; 2.4 will deliver quite a few more.the linux community likes to talk about linux as a stable and reliable operating system, yet there is no real world data or metrics and very limited customer evidence to back up these claims.delivering a scalable system is a complex task and it's not clear that the linux community can solve these issues easily or quickly.in addition, linux does not support many of the modern operating system features that windows nt 4.0 has pioneered such as asynchronous i/o, completion ports, and fine-grained kernel locks.the linux kernel has increasing support for capabilities, which provide the sort of fine-grained privileges needed, but support for capabilities at the user level will be a while in coming.on performance: the linux community claims to have improved performance and scalability in the latest versions of the linux kernel (2.2), however it's clear that linux remains inferior to the windows ntÂ® 4.0 operating system.it's important to understand that licensing cost is only a small part of the overall decision-making process for customers.the very definition of linux as an open software effort means that commercial companies like red hat will make money by charging for services.linux only supports 2 gigabytes (gb) of ram on the x86 architecture, compared to 4 gb for windows nt 4.0.therefore, commercial support services for linux will be fee-based and will likely be priced at a premium.for some users, linux will make a better desktop, for others it "makes no sense."linux lacks a commercial quality journaling file system.
