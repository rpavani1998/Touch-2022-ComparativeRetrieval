instead, pippin fails to defeat the nameless naturalist he defines.
even setting charity aside, fidelity to the text supports the free will reading far better than pippin's interpretation that nietzsche is rejecting the whole model of behavior that posits real motives, goals, intentions, and aversions.
to criticize an interpretation one disagrees with, one should cite something incorrect an interpreter said and present textual evidence that demonstrates its falsity.
his view, which i will be exploring in these chapters, is that views of the soul and its capacities vary with beliefs about and commitments to norms; normative commitments are subject to radical historical change; and so what counts as soul or psyche or mind and thus psychology also changes.
(112-113) setting aside the issue of whether nietzsche had this account of freedom, one wonders how pippin can talk about a hierarchical unity among one's passions after objecting to the sort of psychology that explains things by positing real passions.
he solves this problem by making the doer "notseparate, distinctive from the activity itself; it is in the deed" (75).
here we might ask pippin how exactly normative commitments are connected to psychological claims, how historical changes play into this relationship, and how the resulting psychology will explain our thoughts, feelings, and actions.
nietzsche's psychological explanations -- or any others that we regard as the hard truth of the matter -- lose the advantage that correct psychological explanations have over fanciful self-explanations that smug people might use to feel good about themselves.
pippin seems to have conflated his thesis, that psychology is grounded in the normative judgments of a time, with the obvious fact that normative judgments (which change over time) are realized by particular psychological states.
instead, self-knowledge is not observational but interpretive and, let us say, always promissory, futural, as complexly interpretive as the interpretive question of just what it is that is being done; action-explanation is not causal, and motives cannot be understood as fixed, datable mental items.
perhaps they admire passages such asdaybreak 109, where reasoning about how to combat a vehement drive is revealed to be produced by an even stronger drive controlling the intellect.
if pippin had presented a detailed picture of how normative commitments during various historical periods genuinely license some psychological claims but not others, perhaps he would be able to give useful psychological explanations.

(la rochefoucauld often reveals putatively moral behavior to be a banal activity tractable within even the most flatfooted psychological theories -- the pursuit of self-interest.)

the problem is for views that use mental states in causal explanations, which cross-cuts the naturalist/non-naturalist distinction.
this is a strange way to conduct an interpretive dispute.
according to pippin, "nietzsche does not seem interested in merely naturalizing all talk of motives, goals, intentions, and aversions; he denies that whole model of behavior, 'root and branch.'"

but the only such picture that has been offered allows people to interpret themselves however they please, leaving his psychological stories no better or worse than anything else.
they probably would not want to do this, just because it would leave them with all the difficulties pippin's own view faces, but at any rate there is no special problem for naturalism here.

readers impressed by nietzsche's psychological observations may be intrigued by an interpretation that presents psychology as "first philosophy," and read pippin's book for this reason.
for example, nietzsche is interested in how montaigne maintained "such a thoroughgoing skepticism and clarity about human frailty and failings without pascal's despair and eventual surrender or la rochefoucauld's icy contempt for the 'human all too human'", and how he became "a thoughtful, ferociously honest, cheerful free spirit, someone who had succeeded at the task of 'making [himself] at home in the world'" (10-11).
