so, for example, whether psychological inquiry converges on a theory where minds are understood as symbol-manipulating machines, as statistically driven networks or as embodied-embedded systems, it still faces the philosophical problem of accounting for the role of representation in psychology.
by taking an incremental approach to the problem of consciousness, philosophers of psychology can attend more carefully to distinctions obscured by blanket terms like "consciousness."
instead, while retaining a focus on the problems that bring us to philosophy of psychology in the first place, the collaborative turn has meant an increasing sensitivity to the actual results, methodologies and practices of scientific investigation.
the differences between these two books signal the changed character, as well as the dramatic expansion, of the field.

however, this volume is not intended solely for philosophers with an interest in matters of mind, but also for philosophically inclined psychologists.
however, philosophy of psychology has access to resources which potentially hold the possibility of moving beyond the kind of impasses that plague unaided philosophy of mind.
as this volume shows, the collaborative turn has not subordinated philosophical investigation to the natural sciences; philosophers have not become the "underlabourers of the sciences" in locke's sense.
rather than taking our intuitions as the sole data for a discussion of the nature of conscious experience, philosophers of psychology have a substantial inventory of scientific evidence to draw upon.

we hope that this volume provokes and stimulates psychologists and that they will find a great deal here that is directly relevant to their research.

these, in turn are distinguished from perceptual experience in the sensory modalities and in dream states.
attention, introspection and the temporal components of experience are distinguished from the emotions.

in this introduction, we describe some of the prominent characteristics of the companion and explain how it reflects the current state of the field.

essential reading for all students of philosophy of mind, science and psychology,the routledge companion to philosophy of psychology will also be of interest to anyone studying psychology and its related disciplines.
as the field matures, philosophers of psychology are connecting in substantial ways to moral philosophy.
connectionism and the embodied/embedded framework not only represent novel approaches to cognitive architecture but also present fundamental challenges to the cognitivist views of psychological explanation.
the elusiveness of the target of psychological explanation has direct methodological consequences regardless of one's favored model of mind.

to understand what philosophy of psychology has become and where it is headed, it is useful, once again, to orient ourselves by reference to block's classic anthology.

the contributions to part four reinforce the view that if one is seriously engaged with working psychology, it is no longer the case that one can safely ignore evidence from the biological sciences.
attention, introspection and the temporal components of experience are distinguished from the emotions.
we believe that appreciation of the major positions which frame current debates is improved by attending to the historical development of the relevant concepts and methods.

the contributions to part six demonstrate the relevance of philosophy of psychology to vital normative questions.
