given the scale of  psychological research today, it is useful to maintain some sensitivity to the  broader intellectual context which informs our investigation into mental life.
so, for example, whether psychological inquiry converges on a theory  where minds are understood as symbol-manipulating machines, as statistically  driven networks or as embodied-embedded systems, it still faces the  philosophical problem of accounting for the role of representation in  psychology.
this model assumed  a functionalist metaphysical framework, a computationalist approach to  explanation, and a central role for representation.
it provides a selective tour of the relevant history of psychology and philosophy, moving from the origins of psychology in early-modern philosophy to twentieth-century debates between behaviorists and cognitivists.
the present volume reflects what we believe are some of the most fruitful  lines of investigation in contemporary philosophy of psychology.
by taking an incremental approach to the problem of consciousness, philosophers of psychology can attend more carefully to distinctions obscured by blanket terms like "consciousness."
so, for example, modern theories concerning cognitive architecture and the nature of representation generally take a stand with respect to the relevance of constraints that result from the properties of the neural substrate.
in the early 1980s, philosophers  of psychology had settled into a consensus with respect to the demise of  behaviorism and the centrality of cognitivist architectures.
for  decades, ontogenetic and evolutionary biological considerations have influenced  psychological theorizing.
unlike the metaphysically oriented literature of the 1990s, the strategy for addressing the problem of consciousness in philosophy of psychology involves direct engagement with empirical investigation into the nature of attention and perception.
instead, while retaining a focus on the problems that bring us to philosophy of psychology in the first place, the collaborative turn has meant an increasing sensitivity to the actual results, methodologies and practices of scientific investigation.
excerpt:  the routledge companion to philosophy of psychology follows ned  block's classic anthology, readings in philosophy of psychology (1980/1) by  nearly thirty years.
the problems addressed here relate to  both the architecture within which representational states are couched and to  the possibility of naturalizing content.
for philosophers of  psychology the biological facts of cognition were more difficult to ignore.
one of the central concerns in the recent philosophy has been the  difficulty of accounting for intentionality.
the differences between these two books signal the changed  character, as well as the dramatic expansion, of the field.
while contemporary philosophy of psychology encompasses results from  biology and the other sciences, purely philosophical considerations continue to  figure centrally.
instead, while retaining a focus on the  problems that bring us to philosophy of psychology in the first place, the  collaborative turn has meant an increasing sensitivity to the actual results,  methodologies and practices of scientific investigation.
however, by including a selection of  subjects which is more representative of the contemporary state of play, we are  hoping that the broader philosophical community will be encouraged to recognize  the rich diversity of contemporary philosophy of psychology.
however, this volume is not intended solely for philosophers with an interest in matters of mind, but also for philosophically inclined psychologists.
however, philosophy  of psychology has access to resources which potentially hold the possibility of  moving beyond the kind of impasses that plague unaided philosophy of mind.
while neuroscience has loomed large in recent psychology, biology has  figured in a range of other important ways in psychological inquiry.
our choice of topics in this companion reflects this collaborative approach.
techniques and insights from neuroscience have moved to the heart of  psychological investigation.
these  challenges are discussed in detail in part two.
as this volume shows, the collaborative turn has not subordinated philosophical investigation to the natural sciences; philosophers have not become the "underlabourers of the sciences" in locke's sense.
psychological explanation iv.
rather than taking our intuitions as the sole data for a discussion of the nature of conscious experience, philosophers of psychology have a substantial inventory of scientific evidence to draw upon.
part two reflects  developments in the intervening years, by presenting the more critical  contemporary approach to psychological explanation, folk psychology and  functionalism.

in  recent decades, philosophy of psychology has moved away from a view which  downplayed the significance of biological structures and constraints in the  development of psychological theories.
as philosophers have shown, perceptual experience remains one  of the most intractable problems for a theory of the mind.
these essays should counteract the tendency to see contemporary debates, especially those concerning representation and computation, as straightforward products of the cognitive revolution, allowing students to recognize that the issues at stake have their roots in discussions that date back well before the heyday of cognitivism in the 1960s and 1970s.
part four reviews the principal problems which emerge from consideration of  the relationship between psychology and its biological basis.
the prospect of a new approach to fundamental questions concerning rationality and intentionality drew many philosophers of mind to examine conceptual problems in psychology.
the kinds of concern that continue to bring philosophers to the study of psychology, often involve problems concerning personhood, moral agency and the nature of the good life.
the present volume reflects what we believe are some of the most fruitful lines of investigation in contemporary philosophy of psychology.
by taking  an incremental approach to the problem of consciousness, philosophers of  psychology can attend more carefully to distinctions obscured by blanket terms  like "consciousness."
we hope that this  volume provokes and stimulates psychologists and that they will find a great  deal here that is directly relevant to their research.
thus, developmental and evolutionary considerations feature prominently in many of the chapters in this companion.

it has become a collaborative effort involving the contributions of psychology, linguistics, neuroscience, engineering and other disciplines.
over the past three decades of philosophy of psychology, one of the most  important developments has been the expansion in the range of themes and  topics.
alternative explanatory frameworks to cognitivism are explained  and defended in detail.
in this spirit, the purpose of part one is to present the necessary historical background for the discussions which follow.
