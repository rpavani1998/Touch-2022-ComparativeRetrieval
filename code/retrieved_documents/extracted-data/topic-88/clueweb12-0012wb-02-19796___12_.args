furthermore, even the teaching of general introductory psychology, rather than psychology of religion, could be useful to theology students as it might stimulate their own insights and creative links between the two disciplines.given the popularity of psychology as such, on the one hand, and the potential relevance of scientific psychology to the science-religion debate, on the other, it is both desirable and likely that further links should be forged between psychology and theology at degree level.the main benefit of teaching psychology of religion to psychology students would be filling a gap in their understanding of the history of psychology.the main practical problem in teaching mainstream psychology to theology students would be the lack of psychology staff with sufficient interests in theology so as to make relevant links between the two disciplines.from the viewpoint of the perceived relevance of psychology to theology, it is understandable that many students would like to see a greater component of psychology as part of their theology degree and would prefer a more integrated interdisciplinary input from the two disciplines.second, investigating students’ understanding of how modern psychology works may provide hints for helping students interpret and apply research findings obtained by psychological methods in a more informed and critical manner to their work in theology.moreover, in the opinion of five (out of 17) students cited below, psychology and theology are in need of further and deeper integration.in this regard, teaching of scientific psychology to theology students makes a greater interdisciplinary contribution to their education than the more literary psychological approaches.by virtue of choosing psychology of religion as one of their papers, theology students place themselves in an interdisciplinary context; consequently, their experiences of studying psychology of religion may have wider implications for interdisciplinary issues in higher education.3introduction psychology is a highly relevant discipline to theological and religious studies yet it is only given a minor role in most academic programmes and often it is not included at all.in addition, five students said that psychology was a good choice because its approach to religion was different from that found in their theological papers and as such brought “a breath of fresh air” to their overall study.in short, the aim of the course is to enable students to differentiate between psychology and the other disciplines of religious studies notably anthropology, sociology, history and philosophy of religion.3 no. 2 index page psychology is a highly relevant discipline to theological and religious studies yet it is only given a minor role in most academic programmes and often it is not included at all.by contrast, ppp students regard lectures as an important source of information and learning in psychology, as the following example illustrates.contrary to the general trend of teaching the “traditional” psychology of religion topics in theology departments, namely, psychoanalysis, pastoral, and social psychology, the data obtained in the current project provide clear evidence that theology students perceive scientific psychology as both relevant to their studies and interesting.
