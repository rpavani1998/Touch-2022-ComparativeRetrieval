two students cited their scientific interests as a reason for including psychology in their degree programme whilst one elected to do psychology because it was going to be useful in his future pastoral work.
it’s not repeated to order… you cannot study it scientifically.
whilst ppp students were not asked this question in the same context, they repeatedly conveyed that psychology was conceptually a great deal easier for them than philosophy.
you can study the experiences that religion invokes and try to reduce that to a physiological level, for example, brainwaves.
but it is not clear why, that is, what exactly motivates the students to select a paper that is outside their main discipline.
yes, but not a hard-core science, which i consider physics and chemistry to be.
several were manifestly aware of the possible links between the brain and certain religious experiences (example 17), including a student who suggested that it would be interesting for psychology to study the “god-spots” in the brain.
so… we wouldn’t be able to form interesting models, i wouldn’t have thought.
the information about students’ attendance at the core lectures in psychology of religion will become relevant when we look at the challenges that they encounter in studying psychology.
i think that religious belief is different from most other emotions and understandings of the human mind.
because in philosophy and theology you get a bit of armchair psychology… that’s as far as it goes, whereas psychology is much more concerned about how people actually (?) and also the consequences of the changes on them.
i think faith is a belief in something that even if all the doctrines are taken away, and there is no bible and no place to worship, there would still be a belief that there is something higher than you....
three of those 11 had attended seminars in philosophical psychology and concluded that psychology was still closer to philosophy than to science (example 5).
the lectures cover topics such as origin of religious concepts in human development, different aspects of religious experience (e.g., prayer, conversion), moral development, and religious cognition across life span as well as psychology of religion applied to health and education.
moreover, in the opinion of five (out of 17) students cited below, psychology and theology are in need of further and deeper integration.
whilst ppp students were not asked this question in the same context, they repeatedly conveyed that psychology was conceptually a great deal easier for them than philosophy.
but the best thing about psychology is the short chunk given to read, not a whole book like in theology.
it’s a different approach because it’s using experiments, whereas theology isn’t.
it’s really interesting.
in the case of ppp students, however, the more likely explanation of their misconceptions is the lack of any educational input about religion.
the main practical problem in teaching mainstream psychology to theology students would be the lack of psychology staff with sufficient interests in theology so as to make relevant links between the two disciplines.
that after death you don’t just die and rot away.
i think that religious belief is different from most other emotions and understandings of the human mind.
finally, finding out about students’ experiences with the current psychology of religion paper is relevant to any further integration between psychology and theology or religious studies.
contrary to the general trend of teaching the “traditional” psychology of religion topics in theology departments, namely, psychoanalysis, pastoral, and social psychology, the data obtained in the current project provide clear evidence that theology students perceive scientific psychology as both relevant to their studies and interesting.
philosophy can’t answer religious questions.
finally, theology students have all chosen psychology of religion as one of their optional papers whereas none of the ppp students has studied psychology of religion either formally or informally.
first, the current science-religion debate leaves out psychology as a science of mental life and behaviour.
i think it could be; it would provide a nice twang with philosophy of religion.
i know that you can’t apply psychology to two thousand years ago but the conversion topic derives from christianity and the nt.
but for how religion changes behaviour, i think that a sociological approach is far more fitting.
i got the feeling that perhaps a module on theology for the psychologists would be helpful in their studies.
among the theology group, 10 students were male and 10 female.
for example, the majority of theology students have studied religion at a-level whilst significantly fewer ppp students took a-level religious studies.
the more human aspects of it can, but religion is also of a very particular type, and as such, science cannot throw much light on it.
in connection with each topic, students receive guidance for further reading that includes modern empirical studies of different aspects of religious behaviour and experience, in addition to some of the classical titles from the history of psychology (james, freud, jung).
put simply, psychology could be seen as the most relevant of the sciences to theology students.
not surprisingly, the most common difficulties for theology students consisted of the understanding of tables, statistics, technical terms, and the lack of background knowledge of science in general.
in short, the current project was designed to examine the impact of teaching a predominantly science-based psychological content to humanities students, most of whom have no prior familiarity either with psychology or with scientific approaches as part of their degree studies.
1 through the whole paper, most of the psychologists i read, they seem almost quite… pleasantly baffled about theology.
if we take into account that many theology students also study philosophy as part of their degree, the difference between the two groups regarding their motives for studying psychology is even smaller.
only one of the 20 theology students had attended the core lectures one term prior to having tutorials, as i recommend.
i always see psychologists interfering were they really shouldn’t be.
the fact that seven out of 32 ppp students (22%) choose the philosophy of religion paper suggests an interest in religion, contrary to the stereotypes about an incompatibility between scientific and religious interests.
i always put my non-lecture commitments first because … generally … i am happy in the library reading.
next, and as an indirect way of approaching the same issue, they were also asked what, if anything, was easy in psychology.
i know that you can’t apply psychology to two thousand years ago but the conversion topic derives from christianity and the nt.
conceptually, i think, it was a bit easier than something like buddhism or the nature of religion, which were a couple of papers i did recently.
it is very methodological, it is very data oriented… i feel that my education beforehand was like a philosophical approach, there was much more theory, not so much about scientific experiments.
i really enjoy science and wanted initially to study science but then became very interested in philosophy.
coming from a charismatic background and to find, for example, that worship services are one of (?)
in tutorials, students have a greater choice of topics which to research for their weekly essays on a specific question and subsequently discuss its content and style of argument.
the interviews were taped as well as recorded by pen and were subsequently fully transcribed.
i was very interested in doing philosophy, anyway….
and it reminds you that there is a different, more scientific way of looking at things than one does in philosophy and theology.
well … scientific to me in terms of the methods that are undertaken; otherwise you wouldn’t present its results in a table or give you a statistic that psychology would.
among the misconceptions is the notion that psychology may be in a position to say something about god; that personal aspects of religion are beyond the reach of psychology; and that psychology can tackle only the historical and sociological aspects of religion.
provide clear evidence that theology students perceive scientific psychology as both relevant to their studies and interesting.
first, theology students were asked to say what they found to be difficult in psychology.
reasons for choosing psychology (theology examples: 6, 14; ppp examples: 15, 18).8 6 i guess it was just for a bit of variety, really, and because quite a lot of papers in theology are historical and biblical studies which i didn’t find that interesting… as an option paper i wanted something that was a bit more thoughtful and, perhaps, related to questions that i have myself.
i think it could be; it would provide a nice twang with philosophy of religion.
although the material presented so far sufficiently indicates that theology students do perceive psychology as a science, the next stage of the report
in other words, james had a clear vision of psychology of religion as a branch of natural science and a methodologically demanding subject.
first, whilst the two groups have a similar level of prior familiarity with psychology as a discipline, they differ markedly with regard to their prior background in science in general.
the last category of response (“up to a point”) is of interest because it demonstrates both the subtleties of understanding among the students (e.g., genuine methodological concerns) and, also, their misconceptions about the nature of the psychological approach.
the main interest of such a comparison is that ppp students do not have the option of studying psychology of religion, however, based on their choices of philosophy of religion as a paper, a number of them seem to be interested in religion as a subject of study.
in this regard, teaching of scientific psychology to theology students makes a greater interdisciplinary contribution to their education than the more literary psychological approaches.
such queries are relevant especially in view of the empirically based content of the oxford course.
although they had valuable insights, their research was only ever scratching the surface of theology and i felt there was a lot more (?) but to do that, you need a better understanding of what theology is.
i really enjoy science and wanted initially to study science but then became very interested in philosophy.
reading articles from psychological journals was frequently mentioned as being comparatively difficult albeit, in many cases, an enjoyable challenge, as the example below suggests.
secondly, the science-religion debate would be broadened by increasing students’ awareness of psychology as a science of mental life.
moreover, in the opinion of five (out of 17) students cited below, psychology and theology are in need of further and deeper integration.
it gave me a chance to find out about the scientific approaches… wonderfully, much more rigorous, a real breath of fresh air.
but for how religion changes behaviour, i think that a sociological approach is far more fitting.
in short, the aim of the course is to enable students to differentiate between psychology and the other disciplines of religious studies notably anthropology, sociology, history and philosophy of religion.
the main thing about sciences is the approach to drawing conclusions, and the psychological approach is experimental and in that it is experimental, it is scientific.
nineteen were finalists and one student had just completed year two of her course.
not surprisingly, religion was also seen as an aspect of psychological disorders.
although they had valuable insights, their research was only ever scratching the surface of theology and i felt there was a lot more (?) but to do that, you need a better understanding of what theology is.
as for their familiarity with religion as an academic study, four ppp students were doing the philosophy of religion paper as one of their philosophy options (two of whom also did religious studies at a-level) and one studied religion as part of her first degree abroad.6 participants were recruited for the project via their college e-mail addresses, by receiving a brief message that explained the purpose of the project and appealed to their good will for taking part before leaving oxford in return for a small financial reward.
so, the conceptions of psychology as a science do not seem to be vastly different between ppp students and those studying theology but who have completed the core paper in psychology of religion.
similar to the theology group, one ppp student chose psychology with a view to his future employment prospects.
by contrast, ppp students regard lectures as an important source of information and learning in psychology, as the following example illustrates.
overall, students’ responses to the relevance question ranged from highly relevant in specific ways (e.g., for pastors) to marginally and generally relevant, no more than any other discipline that educates one’s thinking.
lots of technical terms to get to grips … it wasn’t so much difficult, it was new, and you… you sort of start from a different position so you have to kind of think before you start.
from the viewpoint of the perceived relevance of psychology to theology, it is understandable that many students would like to see a greater component of psychology as part of their theology degree and would prefer a more integrated interdisciplinary input from the two disciplines.
first, the current science-religion debate leaves out psychology as a science of mental life and behaviour.
by virtue of choosing psychology of religion as one of their papers, theology students place themselves in an interdisciplinary context; consequently, their experiences of studying psychology of religion may have wider implications for interdisciplinary issues in higher education.3
such queries are relevant especially in view of the empirically based content of the oxford course.
10 freud and jung, the language is familiar.
the biggest thing i found was the research and the studies.
put simply, psychology could be seen as the most relevant of the sciences to theology students.
so, in that respect, there was always something about it which was more enjoyable than the others, the compulsory papers.
nine students answered “yes” when asked if religion could be studied by psychology (example 2), one answered “no” (example 4), whilst the remaining ten said that psychological methods could be applied to religion “up to a point” (examples 8, 9, 14, 19, 20).12 2 i think that psychology helps to enlighten the implications of religious belief.
four ppp students were interested in psychology as a science subject whilst two chose it almost accidentally, having discovered psychology as a degree discipline at the point of applying.
we just don’t know how that stuff works.
as table 2 indicates, 12 theology and 16 ppp students had no prior familiarity with the discipline of psychology (i.e., had not studied it before) whilst eight theology and four ppp students have done some psychology before coming to oxford.
it’s more ideas than facts and evidence.
i guess the fact that it is studying people so you can always relate to something.
contrary to the general trend of teaching the “traditional” psychology of religion topics in theology departments, namely, psychoanalysis, pastoral, and social psychology, the data obtained in the current project
you can study the experiences that religion invokes and try to reduce that to a physiological level, for example, brainwaves.
only upon being shown the topics included in the psychology of religion syllabus, did ppp students admit that religion had cognitive aspects also.
furthermore, once they have chosen the paper, it is not clear whether the students perceive it as relevant to their study of theology and what its conceptual challenges are.
1 through the whole paper, most of the psychologists i read, they seem almost quite… pleasantly baffled about theology.
the combination of biology and philosophy is obviously psychology.
the main benefit of teaching psychology of religion to psychology students would be filling a gap in their understanding of the history of psychology.
it studied a lot more and a lot more widely than i thought it would and, as a christian, i don’t want to believe in something that is all in my head, as it were.
the last category of response (“up to a point”) is of interest because it demonstrates both the subtleties of understanding among the students (e.g., genuine methodological concerns) and, also, their misconceptions about the nature of the psychological approach.
on the whole, theology students do not find psychology to be conceptually difficult; rather, they appear to be frustrated by the lack of experience with research methods.
i think that anyone who goes into the church should do psychology of religion paper.
i felt i made a lot of progress through my reading… and, in some ways, it was also quite easy because i chose to do it; it was my option out of interest.
it gives you lots of statistics and figures and no meaningful interpretation.
1 i found that the reading was more focused and condensed than in theology… like once having to read a 4-page article!
in addition, five students said that psychology was a good choice because its approach to religion was different from that found in their theological papers and as such brought “a breath of fresh air” to their overall study.
i think with theology you quickly come to the conclusion that you can’t reach god through reason, so it has to be faith, and that’s quite interesting from a psychological point of view.
15 ppp caught my attention because i thought it was really a great combination.
given the popularity of psychology as such, on the one hand, and the potential relevance of scientific psychology to the science-religion debate, on the other, it is both desirable and likely that further links should be forged between psychology and theology at degree level.
similar to the theology group, one ppp student chose psychology with a view to his future employment prospects.
introduction psychology is a highly relevant discipline to theological and religious studies yet it is only given a minor role in most academic programmes and often it is not included at all.
in other psychology courses… in other universities, they focus on the less experimental aspects such as freud or jung or folk theories.
you are just not used to things like methods and evidence and that kind of stuff.
well … scientific to me in terms of the methods that are undertaken; otherwise you wouldn’t present its results in a table or give you a statistic that psychology would.
integration does not only mean establishing the links between two disciplines but also understanding what the unbridgeable differences are (gasper, 2001).
what theology students find easy about studying psychology are the relatively compact readings (journal articles), a focused approach, its familiar subject matter (people), freud and jung literature and, for two students, its methodological clarity.
in order to interpret theology2 students’ views of psychology correctly, they will be compared directly with a group of ppp4 students who likewise study on an interdisciplinary degree programme that includes philosophy.
the comparison between theology and ppp students is appropriate for the following reasons.
i guess the fact that it is studying people so you can always relate to something.
conceptually, i think, it was a bit easier than something like buddhism or the nature of religion, which were a couple of papers i did recently.
in order to study certain papers i have to learn greek or hebrew or latin, if i want to do patristics.
some theology 12 8 ppp 16 4 for the majority of students in both groups, freud and jung were the most representative names of the discipline before studying psychology at degree level.
1 i found that the reading was more focused and condensed than in theology… like once having to read a 4-page article!
put differently, the comparison with ppp students shows that misconceptions about religion as a psychological variable are not limited to humanities students.
nine students answered “yes” when asked if religion could be studied by psychology (example 2), one answered “no” (example 4), whilst the remaining ten said that psychological methods could be applied to religion “up to a point” (examples 8, 9, 14, 19, 20).12 2 i think that psychology helps to enlighten the implications of religious belief.
in short, the current project was designed to examine the impact of teaching a predominantly science-based psychological content to humanities students, most of whom have no prior familiarity either with psychology or with scientific approaches as part of their degree studies.
in summary, although psychology is perceived as a very different paper from their theological papers, most students do not find it conceptually difficult and would prefer to study it in greater depth as part of their theology degree.
in tutorials, students have a greater choice of topics which to research for their weekly essays on a specific question and subsequently discuss its content and style of argument.
the interviews were taped as well as recorded by pen and were subsequently fully transcribed.
listed below are some of the typical examples of each group’s reasons for choosing psychology (theology examples: 6, 14; ppp examples: 15, 18).8 6 i guess it was just for a bit of variety, really, and because quite a lot of papers in theology are historical and biblical studies which i didn’t find that interesting… as an option paper i wanted something that was a bit more thoughtful and, perhaps, related to questions that i have myself.
in fact, now i am surprised that it did take up such a large part of the course (laughs).
what is paradoxical about ppp students’ conception of scientific psychology is that it appears to be fundamentally unaware of the ongoing science-religion debate, where different sciences grapple to understand a number of, essentially psychological, questions (e.g., origin and the nature of religious mental states).
the main thing about sciences is the approach to drawing conclusions, and the psychological approach is experimental and in that it is experimental, it is scientific.
secondly, the pattern of prior familiarity with religion as a discipline among the students within each of the two groups is almost a reverse of that for science.
religion as a topic for scientific psychology theology students.
what is paradoxical about ppp students’ conception of scientific psychology is that it appears to be fundamentally unaware of the ongoing science-religion debate, where different sciences grapple to understand a number of, essentially psychological, questions (e.g., origin and the nature of religious mental states).
so, i guess, the psychology of religion was… sort of answered questions about religion and its place in other people’s lives.
but they were still of the view that philosophy was the best framework within which to study mental representations (thoughts), including religious, whereas psychology was concerned with biological bases of behaviour.
not surprisingly, religion was also seen as an aspect of psychological disorders.
furthermore, even the teaching of general introductory psychology, rather than psychology of religion, could be useful to theology students as it might stimulate their own insights and creative links between the two disciplines.
finally, theology students have all chosen psychology of religion as one of their optional papers whereas none of the ppp students has studied psychology of religion either formally or informally.
finally, in order to determine whether their views of psychology have changed as a result of the course, i.e., whether and how the challenges were overcome, the students were asked what they thought of psychology now, after the course.
and perhaps the theological school isn’t as rigorous in collecting that data … if it does it at all.
put differently, the comparison with ppp students shows that misconceptions about religion as a psychological variable are not limited to humanities students.
theology also has explanations but psychology pays no attention.
so, i guess, the psychology of religion was… sort of answered questions about religion and its place in other people’s lives.
psychology lectures are essentially compulsory … absolutely necessary, but philosophy not at all.
in other psychology courses… in other universities, they focus on the less experimental aspects such as freud or jung or folk theories.
secondly, the science-religion debate would be broadened by increasing students’ awareness of psychology as a science of mental life.
for example, if there is a definite trend for everyone to personify sacred things, then you need the psychological tests, the data, which just the scientific aspects of psychology can provide.
the choice of topics within psychology made it even easier.
as pointed out earlier, the majority of both theology and ppp students anticipate studying freud and psychoanalysis, as part of their course and, theology students in particular, are little prepared what to expect in the paper.
religion suffers because people don’t give it enough thought.
so… we wouldn’t be able to form interesting models, i wouldn’t have thought.
more specifically, questionnaires may yield ambiguous responses, which, unless followed up with further questions, would have to be eliminated from data analysis.
i think that anyone who goes into the church should do psychology of religion paper.
although the ppp students’ understanding of psychology as capable of studying religious thought is disappointingly limited, a number of them readily saw that psychological methods were entirely appropriate in the study of religion as an aspect of human thought (examples 3, 12, 19).
by contrast, ppp students regard lectures as an important source of information and learning in psychology, as the following example illustrates.
but the best thing about psychology is the short chunk given to read, not a whole book like in theology.
in order to study certain papers i have to learn greek or hebrew or latin, if i want to do patristics.
because i wanted a change from the biblical papers and, also, i wanted a more practical paper.
as table 2 indicates, 12 theology and 16 ppp students had no prior familiarity with the discipline of psychology (i.e., had not studied it before) whilst eight theology and four ppp students have done some psychology before coming to oxford.
in the case of ppp students, however, the more likely explanation of their misconceptions is the lack of any educational input about religion.
you are just not used to things like methods and evidence and that kind of stuff.
the main benefit of teaching psychology of religion to psychology students would be filling a gap in their understanding of the history of psychology.
it is of interest to mention that ppp students were equally prone to hold confounded notions about the roles of psychology and theology, which became obvious at different points during the interviews.
it’s a really good way of getting a broad perspective in a short time.
as one of their papers, theology students place themselves in an interdisciplinary context; consequently, their experiences of studying psychology of religion may have wider implications for interdisciplinary issues in higher education.3
theology also has explanations but psychology pays no attention.
this includes a-level courses, a major in psychology completed abroad or, simply, having read some mainstream psychological texts.
i always see psychologists interfering were they really shouldn’t be.
and it reminds you that there is a different, more scientific way of looking at things than one does in philosophy and theology.
religiously, it still means a lot to that person.
all the participants received a small fee for taking part in the project, which was paid from a grant awarded to me by the ltsn subject centre for philosophical and religious studies subject (prs-ltsn) mini-project fund.
the main interest of such a comparison is that ppp students do not have the option of studying psychology of religion, however, based on their choices of philosophy of religion as a paper, a number of them seem to be interested in religion as a subject of study.

so, in that respect, there was always something about it which was more enjoyable than the others, the compulsory papers.
so you can see some things that may have led them to think of behaviour in a certain way but you just can’t know what’s inside a person’s head.
i thought it would be less so… when you are combining the two topics, psychology and theology, so that surprised me.
because of the relatively small size of the samples, interview data were analysed mainly qualitatively according to the category of response, restricting numerical analysis to only a few summaries in terms of frequencies or percentages and presented in tables (see below).
first, whilst the two groups have a similar level of prior familiarity with psychology as a discipline, they differ markedly with regard to their prior background in science in general.
it’s a different approach because it’s using experiments, whereas theology isn’t.
cognitive psychology is also easy; it’s about using models.
several were manifestly aware of the possible links between the brain and certain religious experiences (example 17), including a student who suggested that it would be interesting for psychology to study the “god-spots” in the brain.
religiously, it still means a lot to that person.
the information about students’ attendance at the core lectures in psychology of religion will become relevant when we look at the challenges that they encounter in studying psychology.
first, psychoanalysis, pastoral and health psychology generally are applied areas and, to be useful, they require a prior grasp of psychological research method and theory in order to appreciate realistically their findings.

although the material presented so far sufficiently indicates that theology students do perceive psychology as a science, the next stage of the report looks at this question more specifically by comparing directly the views of theology and ppp students.
of the 19 respondents, all have agreed that the oxford course is either very scientific or quite scientific but that in many other universities psychology can be rather different because it would often include freud and psychoanalysis (examples 1, 5, 20).
it is very methodological, it is very data oriented… i feel that my education beforehand was like a philosophical approach, there was much more theory, not so much about scientific experiments.

difficult aspects of studying psychology not surprisingly, the most common difficulties for theology students consisted of the understanding of tables, statistics, technical terms, and the lack of background knowledge of science in general.
next, and as an indirect way of approaching the same issue, they were also asked what, if anything, was easy in psychology.
to illustrate, theology students do not typically take science subjects at a-level (although a few in the current sample have done), whereas ppp students typically take at least two, but usually more, sciences.
of the 19 respondents11, eight seem to view psychology as sufficiently scientific on account of its methodological rigour (examples 1, 7, 11, 12) whilst the remaining 11 are aware of its constraints as a science (example 6).
the investigation reported here deals with a topic that involves a relatively small group of theology students (20); nevertheless, its findings are of interest to all degree programmes involving theology or religious studies that include some teaching of psychology.

whenever appropriate, theology and ppp students’ responses will be compared directly.
it has a solid methodological background, not freud and jung… it is disproving or supporting various theories with experimental evidence… also, the biological aspects, and those are scientific.
the simplest explanation of any such misconceptions among the theology students is their non-attendance at the introductory lectures where methodological points are repeatedly addressed and the nature of empirical psychology highlighted as distinct from the non-empirical disciplines studying religion.
but it is not clear why, that is, what exactly motivates the students to select a paper that is outside their main discipline.
other surprisingly, only four ppp students said that they had a specific interest in psychology; nine stated that their main interest was actually philosophy (other) but, because there was no possibility of studying single honours philosophy at oxford, they chose psychology as a good combination with philosophy.

as an additional way of finding out about the challenging aspects of psychology for theology students, they were asked what they thought of the subject after the course as opposed to before starting it.
i think religion can, because religion is man-made.

in order to study things scientifically, we must observe them.
in connection with each topic, students receive guidance for further reading that includes modern empirical studies of different aspects of religious behaviour and experience, in addition to some of the classical titles from the history of psychology (james, freud, jung).

finally, in order to determine whether their views of psychology have changed as a result of the course, i.e., whether and how the challenges were overcome, the students were asked what they thought of psychology now, after the course.
second, investigating students’ understanding of how modern psychology works may provide hints for helping students interpret and apply research findings obtained by psychological methods in a more informed and critical manner to their work in theology.

coming from a charismatic background and to find, for example, that worship services are one of (?) triggers, enabled me to understand the possible influence of music on the brain… i mean to understand the effect of religious stimuli; it gave me a better ground to ask whether what i experience was the effect of god or just me.
of the 20 ppp students, 12 were male and eight female, with a similar age distribution to that of their theology counterparts, including one mature student.
the simplest explanation of any such misconceptions among the theology students is their non-attendance at the introductory lectures where methodological points are repeatedly addressed and the nature of empirical psychology highlighted as distinct from the non-empirical disciplines studying religion.
secondly, the pattern of prior familiarity with religion as a discipline among the students within each of the two groups is almost a reverse of that for science.
as an additional way of finding out about the challenging aspects of psychology for theology students, they were asked what they thought of the subject after the course as opposed to before starting it.
second, investigating students’ understanding of how modern psychology works may provide hints for helping students interpret and apply research findings obtained by psychological methods in a more informed and critical manner to their work in theology.
lots of time they cover the stuff that you can read about.
instead, the most commonly involved sciences are physical and biological, including neuroscience and neuro-physiology.
and i think it is brilliant for every theology student because it takes a very different look at what we are studying.
i felt i made a lot of progress through my reading… and, in some ways, it was also quite easy because i chose to do it; it was my option out of interest.
the interviews were conducted in a semi-structured format, that is, the same set of pre-planned questions was asked of all the participants albeit in a somewhat different sequence, deliberately allowing for flexibility and spontaneous flow in response to each question.
it has a solid methodological background, not freud and jung… it is disproving or supporting various theories with experimental evidence… also, the biological aspects, and those are scientific.
so, the conceptions of psychology as a science do not seem to be vastly different between ppp students and those studying theology but who have completed the core paper in psychology of religion.
one of the main course aims appears to have been achieved, namely, all the interviewed students did become aware of the empirical character of psychology and its different way of thinking about certain familiar phenomena (examples 1, 4, 16).
i think faith is a belief in something that even if all the doctrines are taken away, and there is no bible and no place to worship, there would still be a belief that there is something higher than you....
nine students had attended at least several lectures one year after they had completed the tutorials, whilst six students did not attend any lectures but relied on their tutorials only.
for the majority of students in both groups, freud and jung were the most representative names of the discipline before studying psychology at degree level.
the interviews were conducted in a semi-structured format, that is, the same set of pre-planned questions was asked of all the participants albeit in a somewhat different sequence, deliberately allowing for flexibility and spontaneous flow in response to each question.
so, when i enjoy something, it’s easy.
interestingly, ppp students seem to differ in their judgement whether psychology can ever become a hard science, even when it uses well-designed research methods (example 19).
3 no … to be honest, i don’t find that they are helpful.
in other words, they transfer their attitude to lectures in the arts subjects to psychology, without realising that accessing information in psychology presupposes some familiarity with its research methods.
as for their familiarity with religion as an academic study, four ppp students were doing the philosophy of religion paper as one of their philosophy options (two of whom also did religious studies at a-level) and one studied religion as part of her first degree abroad.6 participants were recruited for the project via their college e-mail addresses, by receiving a brief message that explained the purpose of the project and appealed to their good will for taking part before leaving oxford in return for a small financial reward.
of the 20 ppp students, 12 were male and eight female, with a similar age distribution to that of their theology counterparts, including one mature student.
and, also, religion is a very personal thing and as such stands outside science.
interestingly, ppp students seem to differ in their judgement whether psychology can ever become a hard science, even when it uses well-designed research methods (example 19).
furthermore, once they have chosen the paper, it is not clear whether the students perceive it as relevant to their study of theology and what its conceptual challenges are.
to illustrate, theology students do not typically take science subjects at a-level (although a few in the current sample have done), whereas ppp students typically take at least two, but usually more, sciences.
3 no … to be honest, i don’t find that they are helpful.
in this university, very, in the sense that it is experimentally orientated.
psychology lectures are essentially compulsory … absolutely necessary, but philosophy not at all.
and i think it is brilliant for every theology student because it takes a very different look at what we are studying.
among the theology group, 10 students were male and 10 female.
but when we are talking about god, god is up there and we are down here, and there is no reason that, because we talk to him today and he talks to us or answers us, why that will happen tomorrow.
nineteen were finalists and one student had just completed year two of her course.
in other words, they transfer their attitude to lectures in the arts subjects to psychology, without realising that accessing information in psychology presupposes some familiarity with its research methods.
in other words, james had a clear vision of psychology of religion as a branch of natural science and a methodologically demanding subject.
the lectures cover topics such as origin of religious concepts in human development, different aspects of religious experience (e.g., prayer, conversion), moral development, and religious cognition across life span as well as psychology of religion applied to health and education.
cognitive psychology is also easy; it’s about using models.
if we take into account that many theology students also study philosophy as part of their degree, the difference between the two groups regarding their motives for studying psychology is even smaller.
i got the feeling that perhaps a module on theology for the psychologists would be helpful in their studies.
we just don’t know how that stuff works.
although a questionnaire would have been a more economical procedure to use, the limitations of questionnaire as a method were judged to be a major constraint on the aims of the project.
one of the main course aims appears to have been achieved, namely, all the interviewed students did become aware of the empirical character of psychology and its different way of thinking about certain familiar phenomena (examples 1, 4, 16).
as pointed out earlier, the majority of both theology and ppp students anticipate studying freud and psychoanalysis, as part of their course and, theology students in particular, are little prepared what to expect in the paper.
in short, the aim of the course is to enable students to differentiate between psychology and the other disciplines of religious studies notably anthropology, sociology, history and philosophy of religion.
three of those 11 had attended seminars in philosophical psychology and concluded that psychology was still closer to philosophy than to science (example 5).
of the 19 respondents, all have agreed that the oxford course is either very scientific or quite scientific but that in many other universities psychology can be rather different because it would often include freud and psychoanalysis (examples 1, 5, 20).
because i wanted a change from the biblical papers and, also, i wanted a more practical paper.
integration does not only mean establishing the links between two disciplines but also understanding what the unbridgeable differences are (gasper, 2001).
only upon being shown the topics included in the psychology of religion syllabus, did ppp students admit that religion had cognitive aspects also.
so, when i enjoy something, it’s easy.
on the whole, theology students do not find psychology to be conceptually difficult; rather, they appear to be frustrated by the lack of experience with research methods.
for example, if there is a definite trend for everyone to personify sacred things, then you need the psychological tests, the data, which just the scientific aspects of psychology can provide.
i guess you don’t really have any empirical evidence about religion but only about people.
it gave me a chance to find out about the scientific approaches… wonderfully, much more rigorous, a real breath of fresh air.
introducing the option of some theological education to psychology courses would soon rectify the deficit.
for example, the majority of theology students have studied religion at a-level whilst significantly fewer ppp students took a-level religious studies.
finally, finding out about students’ experiences with the current psychology of religion paper is relevant to any further integration between psychology and theology or religious studies.
instead, the most commonly involved sciences are physical and biological, including neuroscience and neuro-physiology.
although a questionnaire would have been a more economical procedure to use, the limitations of questionnaire as a method were judged to be a major constraint on the aims of the project.
introducing the option of some theological education to psychology courses would soon rectify the deficit.
four ppp students were interested in psychology as a science subject whilst two chose it almost accidentally, having discovered psychology as a degree discipline at the point of applying.
acknowledgements the current project was supported by a grant from the prs-ltsn mini-project fund.
more specifically, questionnaires may yield ambiguous responses, which, unless followed up with further questions, would have to be eliminated from data analysis.
because of the relatively small size of the samples, interview data were analysed mainly qualitatively according to the category of response, restricting numerical analysis to only a few summaries in terms of frequencies or percentages and presented in tables (see below).
in addition, five students said that psychology was a good choice because its approach to religion was different from that found in their theological papers and as such brought “a breath of fresh air” to their overall study.
it’s really interesting.
in order to study things scientifically, we must observe them.
in fact, now i am surprised that it did take up such a large part of the course (laughs).
only one of the 20 theology students had attended the core lectures one term prior to having tutorials, as i recommend.
i guess you don’t really have any empirical evidence about religion but only about people.
i mean to understand the effect of religious stimuli; it gave me a better ground to ask whether what i experience was the effect of god or just me.
yes, but not a hard-core science, which i consider physics and chemistry to be.
i thought it would be less so… when you are combining the two topics, psychology and theology, so that surprised me.
but when we are talking about god, god is up there and we are down here, and there is no reason that, because we talk to him today and he talks to us or answers us, why that will happen tomorrow.
two students cited their scientific interests as a reason for including psychology in their degree programme whilst one elected to do psychology because it was going to be useful in his future pastoral work.
you might find clues so you can see some things that may have led them to think of behaviour in a certain way
and, also, religion is a very personal thing and as such stands outside science.
the comparison between theology and ppp students is appropriate for the following reasons.
it can be very scientific; that’s a good thing.
the fact that seven out of 32 ppp students (22%) choose the philosophy of religion paper suggests an interest in religion, contrary to the stereotypes about an incompatibility between scientific and religious interests.
from the viewpoint of the perceived relevance of psychology to theology, it is understandable that many students would like to see a greater component of psychology as part of their theology degree and would prefer a more integrated interdisciplinary input from the two disciplines.
