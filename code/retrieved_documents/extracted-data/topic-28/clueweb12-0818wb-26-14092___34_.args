they have loans, not subsidies, and they use it because it is offered and allowed by treaty, and financially interesting for them, not because they are weak.they have loans, not subsidies, and they use it because it is offered and allowed by treaty, and financially interesting for them,boeing does not get launch aids from the us govt to start a particular jet development , it hires sub contractors who compete amongst themselves for the lucrative contracts and get tax breaks etc to be more competitve so that they win over others .giving support, financing, creating / saving jobs, leveling the playing field, protecting us interest etc.the whole american economy is subsidized by the us government.those contracts might be for product development , technology development , procurment etc etc and fixed profits are given to boeing as per us laws and dealings with the dod .boeing gets tax cuts to set up shop in a particular area be it inwa or elsewhere , they get tax insentives just like any other aerospace or large production house gets for setting up a shop in a particular area and contributing to the economic development of that region through employment and buisness generation .boeing gets defence contracts through its integrated defence and phantom works devision but has to compete for those contracts in one of the most cut throat defence industries anywhere in the world (ba-id is second to lma and in many ways have lost due to various reasons) .also putting high pressure on states with government owned airlines in china, israel and japan can be qualified as strong government support i guess.the same contractors also receive bonds and grants to help out on airbus projects.the airbus subsidy is in the form of repayable loans with interest for aircraft development, which is legal according to the world trade organization, pritchard says.given a 5% profit margin (in 2005), boeing made about $1.5b profit from $30b in defense sales, mostly to the pentagon and nasa.you can't at the same time accusing airbus of having undue state help because they are profitable, and saying that they can't do anything without this aid.airbus gets direct subsidies to launch new aircraft, even though they have been in service for more than 30 years, they are just to weak to lauch something on their own user profile send instantthey have loans, not subsidies, and they use it because it is offered and allowed by treaty, and financially interesting for them, not because they are weak wooow really, so they pick loans only because they can?
