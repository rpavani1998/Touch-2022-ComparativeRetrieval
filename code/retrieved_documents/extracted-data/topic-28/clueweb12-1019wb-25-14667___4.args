you can argue about the fairness of this (and, as our readers know, we don’t like “corporate welfare” in any form), but at least the money is now supposed to be at market rates.

it doesn’t matter how many were won; in that case, eight were lost and look who has the tanker contract now.
then the panel found that launch aid, per se, wasn’t illegal, just the implementation of it had been.
the conditions for that “subsidy” to boeing, were even more attractive compared to the ones provide to airbus, i.e. a 10/90% split between boeing and the us government.
my advice: stop this nonsense and invest the saved money into aircraft innovation.
and the us and boeing did get a win in that while launch aid itself is not illegal, the preferential interest rates are and now airbus has to draw any future aid on commercial terms, which is a defeat for the eu and for airbus.
flightblogger has a very good take on how both sides “spin” the final appeal report.

in my view all those law suits and complaints to the wto are pure and needless lawyer’s fodder.
the ustr failed to achieve its top goal, and that is to have the wto rule launch aid illegal, so blocking aid to airbus to make the a350 xwb was a failure.
airbus crows that it won 90% of the wto case against it.
and finally, the wto appeals board reversed the initial finding of the wto panel that subsidies for the a380 were prohibited, also a defeat for the us.
this is a major defeat for the us–and for boeing.
since you had not written anything about this last week, i had thought you did not want to cope with the firestorm of (mostly partisan) comments that would/could result.
the case will, as aspire aviation notes, drag on.

airbus (the eu) won important points at the wto, with launch aid being the big one, but the airbus press release was hyperbolic at best.
well, the icing got made but the cake collapsed in the over.

however, boeing also did received us government financial support to develop the us sst program, to be able to compete with the european concorde program in the late 60′s early 70′s.
boeing, however, continued to ignore the airbus threat, convinced that airbus would “never make it,” as they repeatedly stated publicly, until it was too late 1992, when the us signed a mutual agreement with europe, to limit any subsidies to airbus or boeing, to up to 33% of the development cost of a new aircraft, repayable on commercial turns, i.e. with interest.
the answer, to us, is that it doesn’t, except that this is a “capital market” available to airbus that is not available to boeing.

boeing would most likely protest and then we would see what the wto would have to say.

we can assume that the final boeing report will be at as least as critical of boeing as the airbus one was of airbus.
regardless of who is placing them, airbus as well as boeing, it’s always a loss, both of the contrahents are losing on it, as all those legal battles are only consuming mountains of money without contributing anything to construction/production of better aircraft.
the case will, as aspire aviation notes, drag on.

boeing in 1992, therefore, also secured the right to get us government “subsidies” to get us government financial support, if they needed it, to compete with airbus!
yes, airbus did get european government subsidies in 1970, on a pay-back-if-you-can bases, to unify and “restart” their devided and inefficient commercial aviation industries, to be able to compete with the totally dominating us commercial aviation industries.
we remember northrop grumman and airbus parent eads crowing similarly that it won 100 of 108 complaint items against the appeal of the tanker contract.
the rest was icing on the cake.
fortunately boeing never had to do so, which by itself confirms, that boeing was not “suffering” as much as they claimed they did, up to 1992!

as i had mentioned in the flightblogger comments, i suspect the eu and airbus will merely work out some sort rework on the launch aid, in the hopes it will somehow appease the wto.
