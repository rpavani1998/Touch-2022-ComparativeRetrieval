more importantly, the idea that export subsidies will create jobs and  increase gdp is yet another example of the single-entry-bookkeeping mentality  that has larded the federal budget with so many subsidies and payments to  special interests.
it’s curious, then, that some u.s. companies, conservative groups and lawmakers are arguing against reauthorizing the export-import bank of theunited states, whose sole purpose is to help strengthen the economy and create jobs by supporting the nation’s exports.
however, not good for delta or other u.s. companies that have to compete with air china and its new discounted boeing planes.
the right question is "what does it tell you about the industry for the manufacture of major commercial aircraft (say about 100 to 600 passengers) that no company in the world can fly on its own without government involvement?" why, when boeing's ability to manufacture wings is infinitely superior to mitsubishi's previously non-existent capabilities did boeing farm out the wing manufacture to japan?
in to post a comment comments 4 expand veronique, the problem with all of your arguments against the ex-im is that they presuppose a fair global playing field for boeing.
abuse let me discuss the following point: "moreover, what does it tell you about boeing and its ability to fly on its own without the help of taxpayers that the bank has been providing for decades?
you write about the exim bank but not about the french and german support for airbus.

also, while advocates for the programs claim that the bank takes risk that the private sector is unwilling to take (i wonder why the private sector will, year after year, pass up supposedly great opportunities), the bank’s lending activity is almost certainly irrelevant, since so few u.s. exports are supported through ex-im bank activities.
very few americans are supportive of corporate welfare (liberal term) or crony capitalism (conservative term), but unfortunately many instances of us government support are in direct response to anticompetitive behavior by other governments.
moreover, what does it tell you about boeing and its ability to fly on its own without the help of taxpayers that the bank has been providing for decades?
it is an important message to republicans in particular and it applies to all forms of subsidies (oil, gas, wind, small businesses, manufacturers, automobiles, banks, and others).
if a company can’t stay in business on its own, that is probably because  it is trying to sell stuff that consumers don’t want to buy.

as james explains, the bank not only picks winners and losers by  guaranteeing the loans of private companies, but it also introduces unfair  competition for all the u.s. firms that do not benefit from such special  treatment.
it is unseemly and i will never understand why anyone would think that it is a role of the federal government to help private companies make money, pay their employees, get loans, or produce goods or services at home or abroad.
yes, the giant manufacturer boeing.
if that’s the case, why should consumers then have to buy the goods or the service indirectly through their taxes?

but here is one thing we know: boeing or any other aircraft manufacturer isn't going to survive just because they make the best product at the best price that the world has ever known.

i will leave the conclusion to david stockman, because of his points’  incredible relevance in today’s politics.

but, stockman was wrong.
given the heave-ho to the well-heeled lobbyists of the big corporations who keep the whole scam alive would be dramatic proof that we meant business, not business-as-usual.
in the book, the triumph of politics, stockman does a great job at exposing the export subsidies as a mercantilism illusion based on the strange idea that a country — in this case the united states — can raise its employment and produce wealth by selling its goods for less than they cost to produce.

one of the biggest special interests, in this case, is boeing.
boeing, in turn, figured out that the only way airlines around the world would buy their planes over airbus is if they handed over the manufacture of the plane to the countries where these government-financed airlines were based.
an excellent paper by cato institute’s trade analyst sallie james exposes just how unseemly, inefficient, and irrelevant the export-import bank is.

but to answer your original question, what i know is that boeing has the best technology, and the best manufacturing know-how to build the 787, and they had to farm all of that work out to substandard companies around the world if they hoped to sell the airlines in those countries any of the their planes.

u.s. exports have been a rare bright spot in an otherwise sluggish economy, increasing by about 20 percent over the last two years and driving about half of all economic growth.
boeing is the best manufacturer of this type of aircraft in the world.
i will leave the conclusion to david stockman, because of his points’ incredible relevance in today’s politics.
did boeing just decide they no longer knew how to make airplane doors, and that's why they had to subcontract those out to france?

the truth, he explains, is that “export subsidies  subtract from gdp and jobs, not expand them.”

but along came a government consortium called airbus who could offer financing on their planes that no private company could match because the financing came from european governments who could just print the money they needed.
this is an agency that is in the business of subsidizing private companies with taxpayer dollars.
