also, while advocates for the programs claim that the bank takes risk that the private sector is unwilling to take (i wonder why the private sector will, year after year, pass up supposedly great opportunities), the bank’s lending activity is almost certainly irrelevant, since so few u.s. exports are supported through ex-im bank activities.

it is unseemly and i will never understand why anyone would think that it is a role of the federal government to help private companies make money, pay their employees, get loans, or produce goods or services at home or abroad.
but here is one thing we know: boeing or any other aircraft manufacturer isn't going to survive just because they make the best product at the best price that the world has ever known.

he writes: i had long insisted, to any liberals who would listen, that the supply-side revolution would be different from the corrupted opportunism of the organized business groups; that it would go after weak claims like boeing’s, not just weak clients such as food stamp recipients.

given the heave-ho to the well-heeled lobbyists of the big corporations who keep the whole scam alive would be dramatic proof that we meant business, not business-as-usual.
in the book, the triumph of politics, stockman does a great job at exposing the export subsidies as a mercantilism illusion based on the strange idea that a country — in this case the united states — can raise its employment and produce wealth by selling its goods for less than they cost to produce.
not surprisingly, as a result, in 2011 boeing “accounted for 45.6%, or $40.7 billion, of exim’s total exposure in fiscal 2011.”
