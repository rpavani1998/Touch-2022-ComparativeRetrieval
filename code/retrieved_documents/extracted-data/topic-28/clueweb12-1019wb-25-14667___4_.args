yes, airbus did get european government subsidies in 1970, on a pay-back-if-you-can bases, to unify and “restart” their devided and inefficient commercial aviation industries, to be able to compete with the totally dominating us commercial aviation industries.boeing in 1992, therefore, also secured the right to get us government “subsidies” to get us government financial support, if they needed it, to compete with airbus!boeing, however, continued to ignore the airbus threat, convinced that airbus would “never make it,” as they repeatedly stated publicly, until it was too late 1992, when the us signed a mutual agreement with europe, to limit any subsidies to airbus or boeing, to up to 33% of the development cost of a new aircraft, repayable on commercial turns, i.e. with interest.however, boeing also did received us government financial support to develop the us sst program, to be able to compete with the european concorde program in the late 60′s early 70′s.the conditions for that “subsidy” to boeing, were even more attractive compared to the ones provide to airbus, i.e. a 10/90% split between boeing and the us government.regardless of who is placing them, airbus as well as boeing, it’s always a loss, both of the contrahents are losing on it, as all those legal battles are only consuming mountains of money without contributing anything to construction/production of better aircraft.and finally, the wto appeals board reversed the initial finding of the wto panel that subsidies for the a380 were prohibited, also a defeat for the us.and finally, the wto appeals board  reversed the initial finding of the wto panel that subsidies for the a380 were prohibited, also a defeat for the us.and the us and boeing did get a win in that while launch aid itself is not illegal, the preferential interest rates are and now airbus has to draw any future aid on commercial terms, which is a defeat for the eu and for airbus.the answer, to us, is that it doesn’t, except that this is a “capital market” available to airbus that is not available to boeing.the ustr failed to achieve its top goal, and that is to have the wto rule launch aid illegal, so blocking aid to airbus to make the a350 xwb was a failure.on commercial terms, which is a defeat for the eu and for airbus.as i had mentioned in the flightblogger comments, i suspect the eu and airbus will merely work out some sort rework on the launch aid, in the hopes it will somehow appease the wto.fortunately boeing never had to do so, which by itself confirms, that boeing was not “suffering” as much as they claimed they did, up to 1992!my advice: stop this nonsense and invest the saved money into aircraft innovation.
