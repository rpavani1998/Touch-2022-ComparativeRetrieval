aircraft such as the 777-300er, a340-600 and a350-1000 having such a huge under floor cargo area will benefit tremendously with better payload capability if all that extra volume is to be utilised efficiently on routes greater than 6500 nm (still air).the moves are important not only to airbus’ customers, but also to boeing.if the a-320neo burns that 5,100 lbs per hour and a b-737-800re has an 8% improvement over the a-320neo, then the b-737-800re would burn about 4,690 lbs per hour (cruise).according to airbus the neo will be at least 15 percent more efficient than the current a320 due to the new engine in addition to the sharklets.the 777-300er and the 777-200lr (longer range) were launched infebruary 2000 at the request of airline customers seeking airplanes with additional flexibility to serve the non-stop routes that passengers demand.looking at the ~900 nm difference in nominal range between the 773 and a hypothetical “shorter” ranged a350-1000 would seem to indicate that the latter aircraft would be considerably more capable one than the 773, and that consequently such an aircraft would not be relegated to intra-asian routes as has befallen the 777-300.we are going to re-engine or build a new small airplane and regardless of which we do, our plane will be better and more capable.”of course, airbus could lighten the fuselage structure as well, but to maintain commonality in production and for cost reasons, the aircraft might as well use unmodified a350-1000 fuselage sections, except, of course, section s-15 which would come from the a359 and which will be lighter anyway than the equivalent s-15 section on the a350-1000.http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/06/07/uk-airlines-boeing-iduslne75601720110607 also, there’s some truly bizarre quotes in the article from albaugh regarding the neo vs. 737ng-re/737rs: airbus has mounted a separate challenge to boeing in the most active part of the aircraft market by revamping its a320 narrowbody jet with new engines to offer 15 percent in fuel savings, when combined with performance-enhancing wingtips.albaugh said the choices were a 737 with new engines capable of producing 8 percent better performance than the a320neo, or a new airplane in 2019 or 2010 with 20 percent better performance in fuel efficiency than where the boeing 737 is now.as for the a-321neo itself, it does have good timing as older b-757-200s retire, and the only airplanes in this market that can fill about 90% of the b-757 missions is the a-321neo (not the non-neo version) and the b-737-900er.somehow i think boeing engineers have actually looked at the publicly released information (and possibly learned information from p&w and/or cfm) on the a-32x-neo and have run some numbers to show the response from boeing, giving them some options, a new design, reengining, or both.the extra time will of course be useful/necessary towards squeezing more performance out of the engine and airframe.i don’t have the real fuel burn numbers, so this is an example; if the current model a-320 burns 6,000 lbs of fuel per hour (cruise), an a-320neo would burn about 5,100 lbs per hour (cruise), based on a 15% improvement.this mtow increase on the 1000 would address that need, in which case emirates will upgrade its 900 order to 1000 and possibly order more.
