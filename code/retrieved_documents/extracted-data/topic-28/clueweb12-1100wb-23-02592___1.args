production couldn’t keep up, and serious problems resulted.
even more amazing, when carolyn got promoted to owning all of commercial continuing production (i.e., everything but the 787), she'd built an organization and culture that's since taken 737 fa to over 100 turns.
leveling demand at boeing i was intrigued by an article in the new york times this week describing how boeing is actually turning away orders, even from some of its best customers.
in effect, boeing is seeking to level demand.
however, selling planes is very different from selling cars, with longer lead times, hugely expensive products (and correspondingly huge orders), and a global marketplace that can suddenly change in a radical way (as it did after 9/11).
leveling demand and building partnerships with customers are certainly elements of a lean strategy, and i’m inclined to commend boeing for its approach.
major assemblies, including parts of the fuselage and wings, are built by suppliers in a variety of countries and shipped (in 747s) to everett , washington .
keep in mind that planes being ordered now won’t be delivered for several years.
it’s quite a sight; if you’re ever in that area, make it a point to go.

perhaps boeing has learned more about lean than the u.s. automakers.

it's also possible that ford might be better off with carolyn instead of alan.
many of today’s executives used to work for people who lost their jobs because of what happened.
and if i read the story correctly, it is trying to do so not in a high-handed or arbitrary way, but by communicating with customers so they will understand and accept what the company is doing.

that may not be lean, but it certainly spreads risk on to suppliers.
for example, southwest airlines, a very good customer, wanted to add two planes to an existing order for 737s, and boeing said no (though it did make southwest aware of two nearly-new planes that could be purchased elsewhere).
the times article also noted that, in contrast to its practices years ago, boeing now does little more than design and final assembly.

so today, boeing is taking only the work it is sure it can handle.

boeing is hot right now, partly because of troubles at airbus.
true, toyota is probably better at predicting demand than boeing.
perhaps boeing has learned more about lean than the u.s. automakers.
one last note: early this year i went on a public tour of the boeing facility in everett (which, they boast, is the largest building in the world by volume, according to the guinness book of records).

you don't get to 100 turns with badly leveled demand.

hiring of alan mulally of boeing to be ford’s ceo increasingly looks like the right move.
