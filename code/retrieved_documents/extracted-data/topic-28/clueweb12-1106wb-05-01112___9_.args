russia, japan and china have new airplane industries receiving major government aid, while canada’s bombardier is now selling its cseries that is directly competitive with the airbus a319 and boeing 737-700.eads north america has $1.2 billion in revenues from the defense department and local governments, providing helicopters, homeland security systems, 911 emergency systems, fixed wing aircraft and ship radar and other national security equipment.boeing defense faces growing competition from eads the boeing co.’s defense, space & security unit—which comprises about half of boeing’s revenues— faces increased competition from eads, the european aerospace giant that is parent of airbus.boeing has cyber security contracts with homeland security, the defense department and other us government agencies.boeing has a greater challenge to re-engine the 737 than airbus does with the a320 because the 737 is much closer to the ground to accommodate larger diameter new engines.from the us perspective, the high-profile rivalry is between boeing commercial airplanes and airbus—even in the highly controversial kc-x aerial refueling tanker competition for a $35 billion order from the us air force.we know boeing has received huge subsidies.we know of $5 billion (from us sources) for the 787, and more from outside the us.in each of these, eads competes against boeing for new business, and eads is competing in the us for not only the air force tanker but also for us homeland security business.gallois also took issue with boeing’s interpretation of the wto’s ruling against airbus that it received billions of dollars in illegal aid.zoller says that eads plans to be a major player in a market now dominated by northrop grumman and california’s global atomics, in competition with boeing.let’s get existing programs right before new a320 model: airbus airbus needs to get its current, troubled airplane programs right to free up resources before it proceeds with a re-engine program for the a320 family, says john leahy, chief operating officer for customers.the contract is worth $35 billion.the way the two claims are treated is not preparing the best conditions for negotiations.”the goal is $10 billion in revenues by 2020, excluding the tanker.
