like b/e aerospace, cedar rapids, iowa-based rockwell collins is in a prime position to profit from the global boom in commercial-aircraft sales.when pwc recently analyzed the readiness of suppliers to deliver the ramp-ups projected for the boeing 737 and 777, the airbus a320 and a380, and other major programs, the firm concluded that 21% of suppliers face a high risk of falling behind on the demand.a recent pwc report assessing the operational readiness of the aerospace supply chain notes that the aircraft oems have "pushed much of the design and manufacturing work to suppliers, often in the form of risk-sharing partnerships."we will expect more from our suppliers in their performance, and we're also going to have to hold ourselves -- as a customer to our supply base -- more accountable for how we interact with them as well." in its most recent market forecast, boeing predicted that surging demand in the asia pacific region will propel a $4 trillion market for new commercial aircraft over the next 20 years.khoury pointed out that the $800 million order not only positions b/e aerospace as a tier 1 supplier to boeing but also opens the door for "substantial" opportunities to retrofit existing jets with the modular lavatories.the new owners usually push the companies to grow their business and cut costs -- without investing in manufacturing capacity.in the case of the dreamliner, transferring more risk to boeing's far-flung global supply chain added "a lot of complexity" and "a lot of failure points" to the program, gates says.they're also recognizing the "growing interdependence" between themselves and their suppliers, says bruce king, senior vice president, operations, for rockwell collins inc. given the dizzying complexity of the components and assemblies involved in aircraft production, king believes it's time to jettison "that old model of buyer and supplier."the suppliers are very concerned about their ability to meet the ramp-ups that airbus and boeing are talking about, as well as continuing to service bombardier, embraer and the new entrants that are coming along," says hamilton, who is managing director of leeham co. llc, an issaquah, wash.-based commercial-aviation consulting and research firm.if the long-term demand comes in at, say, 30,000 airplanes, that means airbus and boeing will need to crank out 1,500 commercial airplanes per year -- after producing 1,000 planes for the first time ever in 2011.- print - email - discuss - bookmark - twitter - newsvine - rss as boeing and airbus ramp up, it's crunch time for aerospace suppliers fueled by surging demand in asia, commercial-aircraft production is hitting record levels.rss as boeing and airbus ramp up, it's crunch time for aerospace suppliers fueled by surging demand in asia, commercial-aircraft production is hitting record levels.the company's electronics and communications systems have a major presence on the 787 dreamliner -- which features more rockwell collins content than any other commercial jet in the company's history -- as well as the boeing 747-8 and the airbus a350.despite soaring to all-time highs in sales, earnings, cash flow and bookings in 2011, the sky could be the limit for b/e aerospace.
