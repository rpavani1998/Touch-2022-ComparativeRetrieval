however, selling planes is very different from selling cars, with longer lead times, hugely expensive products (and correspondingly huge orders), and a global marketplace that can suddenly change in a radical way (as it did after 9/11).leveling demand and building partnerships with customers are certainly elements of a lean strategy, and i’m inclined to commend boeing for its approach.the times article also noted that, in contrast to its practices years ago, boeing now does little more than design and final assembly.major assemblies, including parts of the fuselage and wings, are built by suppliers in a variety of countries and shipped (in 747s) to everett , washington .and if i read the story correctly, it is trying to do so not in a high-handed or arbitrary way, but by communicating with customers so they will understand and accept what the company is doing.for example, southwest airlines, a very good customer, wanted to add two planes to an existing order for 737s, and boeing said no (though it did make southwest aware of two nearly-new planes that could be purchased elsewhere).many of today’s executives used to work for people who lost their jobs because of what happened.that may not be lean, but it certainly spreads risk on to suppliers.production couldn’t keep up, and serious problems resulted.hiring of alan mulally of boeing to be ford’s ceo increasingly looks like the right move.leveling demand at boeing i was intrigued by an article in the new york times this week describing how boeing is actually turning away orders, even from some of its best customers.true, toyota is probably better at predicting demand than boeing.in effect, boeing is seeking to level demand.even more amazing, when carolyn got promoted to owning all of commercial continuing production (i.e., everything but the 787), she'd built an organization and culture that's since taken 737 fa to over 100 turns.so today, boeing is taking only the work it is sure it can handle.
