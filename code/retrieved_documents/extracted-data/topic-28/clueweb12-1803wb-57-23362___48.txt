but i think they’ll struggle to offering the delivery positions that united will need.
it needs the max but the airline also is put into an odd position in that it is likely faced with the following scenario:
but enough about me, let’s look at the last year in the airline world.
electronic bleed air will be added to improve  cabin pressurization (which is much like how the a350 will use bleed air)and  better means more efficient fuel burn.
i’ll point out that the a320 aircraft started deliveries in the late 1980’s (1988) and several us airlines such as united own some of the oldest models.
they’ll also try to flog the a380 as much as possible and may even succeed with small orders in parts of the world it hasn’t penetrated much to date.
lufthansa did itself a favor and got rid of bmi and i expect they’ll continue their very conservative mangement of the airline and the subsidiary airlines.
the truth is, boeing will be happy to sell to o’leary and take his  abuse while they do it.
it stings a bit for boeing but . . .
enough so that they could buy them, operate them for a few years and sell them at a profit.
they’ll be from wichita, kansas to st. louis or knoxville, tn to chicago.
and a market glut of aircraft can result in depreciating demand for  your new generation aircraft because the capital costs for current generation  aircraft can become low enough to make sense for airlines to buy and use.
jal will take delivery of its 787s and find that they not only work well for jals needs but actually exceed expectations.
they were kept in the loop and they endorse the aircraft but no other talk of an order.
but i do see south america becoming a bit of a battle ground between airline alliances.

filed under: airline fleets by ajax 2 comments » ryanair says that it may buy or lease used aircraft to fill its gaps until the comac c919 arrives in 2018 with a 200 seat aircraft.
what those airlines have learned is that neither boeing nor airbus has a supply chain that can meet all their needs all of the time and on time.
had they not had  to make that announcement, these new details would seem very much on time.
if there is one thing boeing knows, it’s that they cannot afford to damage their credibility with airlines further with a late arrival of the 737max.
almost all of the a319s arrived in the early 2000s.
they’re just not going to give away  aircraft anymore and it appears that it will take o’leary a while longer  to realize the position he and his airline are in.
mcdonnel douglas execs never could decide when to fight so ended up hardly ever fighting.
furthermore, airbus made some big promises for the a320neo
i strongly suspect we’ll see a metallic silver used with the current paint scheme over that.
at the end of the day, it’s about having a customer and earning money.
the financial crisis in europe will reduce some demand on oil but i see no real economic growth in any part of the world that will drive demand either.
they had a short extension to their usefulness but you will see these depart rapidly from us based fleets over the next 1 to 3 years.
mcnerney acknowledges that us airways hasn’t bought boeing in a some time and sees aa as a loyal boeing customer as well.
it may be named united but it is run by continental executives now and those executives have found ways to effectively use the 737 on their routes.
they are working very, very hard to bring as much advantage as possible to the single aisle wars with airbus.
initial orders will reflect some pent up demand to replace aircraft but it’s unlikely that the pace will continue in a sustained manner.
it’s clear that major boeing customers want to see something on the table.
the benefit in fuel savings on this order will take a while to be realized.
the airline with the most fuel efficient aircraft will see an advantage.
erj-140 and crj-200 aircraft are not going to be practical going forward.
airbus coo john leahy has actually come out and called for bombardier to cancel the airplane.
they’ve proven me wrong and i think the results are too good for them to not to continue over the next 12 months.
i also think that united and delta will be growing a bit more concerned about aa late in 2012 once they have a picture of what aa’s cost structures are likely to be.
if you can build if efficiently at current production rates (in the mid 30’s per month), you can figure out how to build it at a 60+ aircraft rate when that time comes.
however, what makes sense for aa doesn’t necessarily make sense for another airline.
other airlines are evaluating the options for what they need in the next 15 to 20 years.
all of that said, boeing is in danger of becoming a bit too secretive of its plans.
he mentions that what they’ve seen from the a320neo
both boeing and all other airlines have largely been silent on the 737re since that order.
had they not had to make that announcement, these new details would seem very much on time.
there is a gentleman’s agreement that has been followed since the 1990’s that has had aa getting preferred aircraft pricing and early slots in return for remaining an all boeing customer.
not because airbus invaded the united states (they’ve already done that) but because aa would be regarded as one of boeing’s most solid customers.
they appear to be working very hard to make every gain possible against their  competitors to bring even more to the table.

look for airlines to “upsize” their aircraft.
that’s why i honestly believe we’ll see a large order from southwest airlines for the 737max.

they are getting closer and i do believe that china will one day manage to succeed.
sub-130 seat routes aren’t going to be long and thin transcontinental routes.

the far east chinese airlines will order more aircraft and i expect we’ll see orders from them for 777s and a380s and possibly some a350s.

united and delta made money.
it’s notable that even that aircraft got a better wing in the form of having raked wingtips a la 767-400er for longer duration, efficient flying.
my greater point is that you don’t win and you don’t grow as a company by playing “keep up” and playing it safe.
as strong or stronger than the superlegacy airlines.
airlines will continue to make large orders for more fuel efficient narrow body aircraft.
southwest will start painting airtran aircraft in its colors and operating even more great deals to more places from atlanta
why no orders from southwest yet?
therefore, i think the a320 family order will be either a)
the real challenge in this aircraft is ensuring support and with boeing as a consultant, it may well have some help in that arena.
tomorrow, a summary of what i see for 2012 and the world airline industry.
but that would require a fleet change that would take years to accomplish and with a320neo delivery positions reaching “unobtanium” levels for the next decade, the 737max probably does offer the best option given their position.
this is why you’re seeing fairly strong orders for the neo from existing airbus customers.
it would appear that airlines vocalized a desire for a new aircraft and ordered the re-engine like it was the best thing to happen since the concorde.
a good example of that last part is delta buying more and more md-90 aircraft.
right now, we don’t even know what the 737-re will be called and that’s kind of bad.
if anything stirs in the us airline industry, i think it will be in the lcc arena

many have the incorrect idea that aa is contractually committed to buying boeing only.
again, these are 1970’s aircraft and while their amazing performance lent them a lease on life, they’ve become very expensive balanced against other aircraft that can perform 90%+ of the same missions.

i do not think the pilots are going to cede that territory under the current contract or whatever agreement is made for the near future.
virgin america has horned in on american’s routes, frontier has struggled more and more under republic airways leadership and us airways still doesn’t have pilots or flight attendants integrated onto one seniority list.
boeing can’t afford to dither around much longer.
first, garuda is hardly a critical boeing network carrier.
airlines of that size can no longer afford to be an exclusive customer of one manufacturer or another.
finally, buying blocks of the a320neo and 737max will make an airline look smart.
i do not see any us based orders for the a380.
the a321 will do a better job of fitting aa’s requirements for a boeing 757 replacement compared to the equivalent 737-900er.
they all enjoy the same problem in this area.
the bravado always seems a little distasteful when you consider how airbus got where it was and, at the same time, i’m glad for airbus’ presence because it’s clear that it does motivate boeing to do better.
these are 1970’s design aircraft and with engines of similar caliber.
they’ll hang on for a bit longer
united will order a nice chunk of aircraft and i’ll bet that it will be an order similar in mix to the american airlines order from both airbus and boeing.
neither manufacturer are, in the least, that desperate.
all in all, i think it will be a tough year for european airlines.
neither boeing nor airbus is interested in making such deals anymore and rightfully so.
offering that you couldn’t figure out how to immediately ramp up production to 40 to 60 aircraft a month is a somewhat lame excuse for backing away.
and i think they’ll bump up orders for the 787 and 777 as well.
there is maneuvering room left with those fleets.
fuel costs will continue to be a difficult thing for airlines to manage.
because these changes add more risk to their ability to deliver this aircraft in 2017.
perception is as important as facts when it comes to whether or not an airline views your aircraft as leading edge.
they have a firm handle on the 787-9 development and i think they’ll find it within themselves to repeat that on the 787-10.
so far, they’re impressed but what they’ve seen of the 737max so far does not.
and they will get a good deal but gone are the days of getting a deal where you can buy a 737-800 and sell it in 3 years to *make* money on the sale.
no one else is any farther along.
but i would say that we now have reason 998 why boeing should, you know, get with the program.
at  the end of the day, it’s about having a customer and earning money.
much like the new and improved a330 that airbus tried to sell many years ago didn’t fly either.
make no mistake, this really would be a very big loss for boeing.
instead, we learn at southwest airlines’ earnings call that they were kept in the loop and . . .

expect virgin atlantic aircraft to start carrying some message against the iag deal for bmi.
so i’m not sure why o’leary wants to make an enemy of boeing.
some years airbus delivers more aircraft or sells more orders, other years it is boeing that does so.
their size (and the size of several competitors) demand manufacturing positions that can’t be serviced exclusively by one manufacturer.
with the announcement made on the a350-1000 (which would appear to more or less bring that aircraft into competitive range of the 777-300er but not exceed its capability), it’s time for boeing to bet again.
the capital costs are low compared to current boeing aircraft  and the airliner provides close to current boeing efficiencies.
both know that some who have ordered both current and next generation aircraft aren’t necessarily going to be around to take delivery on those aircraft 5 years from now.
airbus needs to understand that it isn’t going to compete everywhere all of the time.
the same is true of the a320neo.
i’m talking about the 737-300/400/500 series aircraft.
some perceive that boeing has been slow to release details and i understand that perception but the truth is that american airlines’ order last summer forced their hand into a premature announcement.
as you can imagine, this spurred quite a bit of speculation.
the truth is, aa is big enough to get preferred pricing and early slots regardless.
i think it’s possible that virgin america will make money in 2012 and i think it is really possible that we’ll all be pleasantly surprised by that.
it’s not the late 1990’s or early 2000’s and manufacturers are not struggling to sell aircraft.
it is thought that boeing will have a slight advantage that,  according to many, will remain about 2% better than airbus.
airbus will want to keep united
it’s possible that the pratt & whitney engine may have more future potential but right now it also has a lot of risk associated with it.
moreover, i suspect that they would like to be let in on the discussions about what an airline *wants* in a new single aisle airliner / 737 replacement / 737 re-engine.
instead of making any real progress with its labor force, it decided to file bankruptcy but not before having made a historic order for aircraft from both airbus and boeing for the a320 and 737 series aircraft (with both a320, a320neo, 737 and 737max in the mix).
the determining factor?
but the airlines makes a strong profit.
this, in some ways, smells like boeing trying to maintain the older airliner to use as an replacement for aging military aircraft such as what they’ve done with the 737 in creating the boeing p-8a poseidon (replacement for the venerable p-3).
the manufacturers think the neo and the max will garner enough orders to justify those production rates.
let’s look at the details first: the aircraft will begin arriving from both lines in 2013 and american airlines thinks it will have one of the youngest fleets in about 5 years.
in fact, i think it may well end up being the 737max-9 instead of the 737max-8.
look at the seat numbers on these aircraft.
that means an aircraft that receives enough modifications to handle the heavier cfm leap56 engine with a reduced fan diameter which should make the 737 models roughly equivalent to the airbus a320neo with about 2% cost efficiency advantages over the a320neo.
i do not expect to see another new airline show up and i think we may well see one true lcc depart the picture if things get particularly rough with respect to fuel prices or competition.
if it were to be a re engine strategy, it would have been far more encouraging to see boeing design a new wing or a modification to the wing to bring additional gains.
but what about the md-90s, you ask?
lost in the noise: pinnacle airlines and sean menke aa responds to us airways / union announcement aa unions and us airways: that cracking sound why would unions look at us airways?
there are no more improvements and as fuel climbs, these aircraft become quickly unattractive even when completely paid for.
if aa manages to get a new pilot agreement that allows aa to subcontract its sub 150 seat flying, i’ll be rather shocked.

if i were a boeing customer, i would imagine that my attitude towards boeing at this point would be quite similar to swa’s ceo gary kelly’s.
while ryanair says its dead serious about this aircraft, they conveniently do not rule out striking a deal with boeing or airbus on their aircraft and i would point out that china has yet to produce a viable commercial aircraft . . .
i dislike the bravado and somewhat cheap order tactics as well.
jetblue decided to fly more to the caribbean, entrench itself even more at jfk airport and blew it during an october snowstorm (again).
that’s what has happened so far.
there have been a number of predictions that the leap56 will be the sale leader in a320neo sales over the long term.
i also think that delta will decide its not afraid of southwest and it will decide to give southwest a taste of bullying it hasn’t experienced before.
is that support founded on  sheer love for the airline?
instead, this is a “put up or shut up” move to boeing and i’ll wager that it won’t be the last.
richard branson actually didn’t make the news very often except to shout, stamp his feet and act insulted that virgin atlantic wasn’t able to do a deal to win bmi.
diversifying between manufacturers isn’t a bad idea anyway as it makes things just a bit more competitive and the airlines probably gains from that.
if  o’leary and company wish to continue to operate a successful ulcc,  they’ll be lining up to buy them as well because they do offer the kind  of incremental gain in efficiency that is going to make the world’s  legacy airlines much more competitive with ulcc’s like ryanair.
what’s the leap56 advantage?
instead, i think we’ll see more of the same in most respects.
this was the tough choice engineering wise.
both know  that some who have ordered both current and next generation aircraft  aren’t necessarily going to be around to take delivery on those aircraft  5 years from now.
it’s a tall order and a difficult  challenge for both manufacturers.
furthermore, it even gives boeing an “in” with the us airways executive team that it has not had for some time.
ryanair will back away from this aircraft quietly, i think.
i don’t expect a large widebody order nor a narrowbody order.
they’re just not going to give away aircraft anymore and it appears that it will take o’leary a while longer to realize the position he and his airline are in.
presently, the smallest aircraft in its fleet will be the 737-800 or a320 at roughly 160 seats.
the truth is, i think the airbus a320neo does fit ryanair’s needs a bit better these days.
if they’re confident they can make a new airliner that is 20%+ better, make the bet and get going on it.
some airlines do desperately need newer, more economical airliners.
this is the first official mention of a 737 re-engine and i think we’re going to see some gnashing of teeth on the part of some airlines over the idea that a fresh design is likely 10+ years away.
this really is an order of equals practically speaking.
there is no financial penalty for walking away from this except what aa might not get in preferred positions and pricing.
airlines want to know what boeing is going to do and waiting very much longer is likely going to result in either more orders for airbus or renegade orders to bombardier and embraer.
however, southwest knows that a new single aisle airliner will be available around 2025.

if o’leary and company wish to continue to operate a successful ulcc, they’ll be lining up to buy them as well because they do offer the kind of incremental gain in efficiency that is going to make the world’s legacy airlines much more competitive with ulcc’s like ryanair.
but it doesn’t mean md-90s (which use a far better engine).
right now, boeing can reach to the high 40’s without too much trouble.
the one thing it hasn’t done is announce major paper losses as a result of fuel hedging.
bombardier will work its tail off to sell more of the cseries and i think it may even succeed.
well, i wouldn’t be surprised if this was both a warning shot over the bow to boeing as well as a serious discussion.
that’s an aircraft that has run its course without something game changing.
i also think that gaining the latam membership is not nearly as “sure” as they think it is.
aircraft manufacturers don’t win over the long term with derivatives and i’ll point out that there have been a total of 9 major derivatives of the 737 with several sub-derivatives of those as aircraft as well.
2012 will be largely so as well.
that’s the part that is suspect.
they are almost all from existing airbus customers and from customers in areas where airbus and france have heavy influence.
we won’t see a need for production rates at 50 or more per month until a manufacturer gets off its duff and builds a new single aisle aircraft.
this is what you politely call a tap on the head for boeing.
but the world has changed.
if it buys the 737-max, it will need to hold onto those aircraft for about 20 years.
i don’t think the decisions they are now announcing about this aircraft reflect a company that is struggling to maintain the status quo in the marketplace.
that’s a lot of aircraft and it wasn’t that long ago when boeing and airbus could hardly find a buyer for the planes they were producing.
it needs this single aisle market for many reasons and the airlines are dissatisfied with boeing’s tentative approach to what it plans to offers airlines next.
why do i think so?  because these changes add more risk to their  ability to deliver this aircraft in 2017.
europe: british airways managed to get through 2011 without any huge problems and saw willie walsh move up to the ceo position of international airlines group which means willie’s still in charge.
it does mean that we’ll see older aircraft from the 70’s and 80’s going away.
it’s not just an opportunity for southwest to succeed in atlanta but it is also an opportunity for delta to capture lost customers.
airlines need stable oil prices and, frankly, so do the world economies.
airbus has to get its act together on the a350 and try very, very hard to prevent too much schedule slip.
that said, i also think airbus is a bit reactive when it comes to competing.
(although one does wonder if they’re considering enough range / payload for the 787-10 given that airlines clearly enjoy the performance of late model 777-200er/lr aircraft.
it would have also been more encouraging to see a modification to the nose gear to permit a full on adoption of the cfm leap56 and, possibly, even the addition of a 2nd engine choice (pratt & whitney gtf).
but i also think that if any slots at jfk, lga, ewr, iad or dca come available for purchase, southwest will bid the cost of a boeing and lose again.
they want to extract as much value from those right now as possible because they know that as soon as they do introduce new airliners, those orders will change quickly.
airbus boxed boeing into this aircraft by introducing the a320neo.
american eagle has crj-700s that are configured from 63 to 65 seats and aa is currently scope clause limited on how many of these aircraft it can fly.
because fuel prices did not go up high enough for those fuel hedges to provide benefit.
my own preference was to see boeing make a move for an entirely new aircraft with introduction into service in 2018.
airlines will continue to constrain their capacity and that will show more discipine than i thought they had 3 years ago.
and that points out a glaring gap that i haven’t seen anyone talk about yet.
the merged  airline would, upon conclusion, have far more boeing aircraft and far more  resources to service and operate boeing aircraft than airbus aircraft.
furthermore, both airlines have orders for airbus a320neo aircraft  already.
that doesn’t mean that airlines with next generation 737s or airbus a320 series aircraft will be dumping their fleet for new aircraft.
most believe that the status quo between the two manufacturers will be  maintained.
south america latam got its approval from brazilian and chilean authorities (barely) and latam will begin consolidating its operations to make more money.
a good example of that last part is delta buying more and more md-90  aircraft.
some of these committments are memorandums of understanding, some are letters of intent and some are orders.
it’s a good evolution for the airline and it will continue to fit within its business plan for some time to come.
it is thought that boeing will have a slight advantage that, according to many, will remain about 2% better than airbus.
in fact, i was a big advocate of fuel hedging not because of the windfall profits it provided many airlines for many years but, rather, because it really did make costs stable.
that leads us to another reason why that class of aircraft is needed.
north america: southwest airlines did its deal with airtran and bought itself an atlanta base of operations and some very valuable landing slots at northeastern airports.
o’leary, not surprisingly offers that anybody buying aircraft right now is nuts given the prices.
it’s the price volatility that hurts them.
he  mentions that what they’ve seen from the a320neo
the 757 is entering into this territory as well.
is this support for aa an attempt to preserve the aa orders for boeing  737max aircraft?
if any orders come from the us, it will be years in the making.
and both boeing and airbus are struggling to figure out how to increase their production beyond their plans for production rates that will already be historic for commercial airliners.
i expect that we will see airlines focus more and more on fuel economy over the next several years.
i admire the gusto in which they present themselves and the entreprenurial spirit with which they approach their brand management with.
this order is about a marginal increase in capacity over time for most routes with the 757s leaving ever so slowly over time.
i would look for a sizeable portion to be 737-900er aircraft with some 737-800s.
the only way to offer early positions is to increase production even more.
airbus can’t build more even faster to meet the demand on the  a320neo even with some airlines orders going away.
the dirty secret about that order is that lion isn’t an airline with significant risk both in operations and financially.
it is universally recognized that while oil prices may one day stabilize, they won’t return to $20/barrel.
however, in this particular case this really is a formality.
it still doesn’t realize that kind of synergies it needs to from its merger.
when the market is flooded with those aircraft, the manufacturers have a much harder time selling customers into their newest and best.
so i’m not sure  why o’leary wants to make an enemy of boeing.
these aircraft will be on operational leases and it appears aa didn’t have to put much money down for these firms orders (if any.)
so it doesn’t hurt for aa to talk to airbus.
i suspect that if doug parker is able to re-assure boeing over its existing aa orders, boeing will go neutral or even supportive of such a merger.
despite all the bravado, what we know is that both aircraft manufacturers pretty much compete evenly in the marketplace.
embraer is considering what to do next when it comes to either re-engining its e series aircraft or building a new airliner (and i think they’ll build a stretched e195 with new engines, frankly.
theoretically, they did with the american airlines order but . . .
it’s a delicate line they each walk.
japan will find ana deploying more and more 787s on more and more routes with more and more success with that aircraft.
those positions are needed now and over the next 7 to 10 years.
american needs better seat mile costs on its routes and it can achieve those because it can fill its aircraft with business passengers.
in fact, any worry about the 737max is kind of silly.
what delta is keeping isn’t nearly as old and inefficient as you think and the aircraft are far less capital expensive than new aircraft are.
in addition, boeing has and continues to support aa’s purchases for aircraft in a variety of ways.
is that support founded on sheer love for the airline?
is growth to 50 or more per month justified?
this won’t be revealed a la one big announcement john leahy  style.
that’s eminently possible for them to do.
the bombardier cseries does fit that whole very nicely and does it in harmony with this announced order.
ryanair got stunning prices for their original massive orders.
it might be time for more airlines to roll with the punches.
they wield enough buying power to make any aircraft manufacturer sit up and pay attention.
look at me!” to boeing and airbus. ]
right now, we’re a long way away from seeing a sales leader in that aircraft category.
a number of analysts have noted that the real goal for airbus this next year is to sell production slots that are open for current a320 aircraft up to and including eis for the a320neo aircraft.
take delta, for instance.
the md-80’s are departing and rightfully so.
so they want to slim those lists down as much as possible right now.
airbus can’t build more even faster to meet the demand on the a320neo even with some airlines orders going away.
they’ll be the routes they are today and the routes we see developing even now.
at the end of the day,  most airlines prefer to see results over having a grand announcement.
i think american airlines will plod through its bankruptcy in 2012 with a bit of scandal here and there.
both boeing and airbus need  to find ways to preserve value on existing aircraft lines until their new  generation aircraft enter into service as well.
but that would require a fleet change that would  take years to accomplish and with a320neo delivery positions reaching  “unobtanium” levels for the next decade, the 737max probably does  offer the best option given their position.
the post i composed and just deleted talked about how having a single source for your aircraft wasn’t really practical for an airline of aa’s size and all other superlegacy and legacy airlines operate mixed fleets already as a function of a merger.
filed under: airline fleets by ajax no comments » various media reports point to boeing leaning heavily towards a “minimum” investment strategy in defining what the new boeing 737 re engine would look like.
about 1/3 of the a320s were delivered in the mid 1990s with the balance showing up from around 2000 and on.
yes, that begins to look like a new airliner but it puts boeing firmly ahead in the narrow body game.
so, is a growth to 40 aircraft plus or minus a month justified?
the a318 is a very poor candidate for the neo and the 737-600 really isn’t offered anymore.
what this isn’t is a loss for boeing.
the cs100 isn’t the attractive aircraft but its the one that will fly and deliver first.
and boeing can’t be just a medium to large aircraft builder.
the other aircraft it points to are those that many may not have considered.
second, airbus landed committments for 500+ aircraft.
it wasn’t irrational for aa to go to airbus.
i firmly believe that boeing was leaning towards a new aircraft but also needed time and space to get where it needed to be with that aircraft.
to the contrary, they are struggling to meet demand based on orderbooks.
how will american airlines paint its a320 family?
o’leary, not surprisingly offers that anybody buying aircraft right now  is nuts given the prices.
the truth is, boeing will be happy to sell to o’leary and take his abuse while they do it.
this has begun to feel like an addiction problem.
on the other hand, it’s notable that fuel hedging contributed significantly to their losses on paper.
i think we’ll see frontier either spun off rapidly in 2012 or the rapid decline of the airline necessitating bankruptcy of republic airways.
now, aa has also announced that it will spin off american eagle soon and we’ll talk about that in a future post but that only means aa can (and will) access other regional airlines for its sub-100 seat flying.
this airline also flies from far less popular hubs, contracts with far less ideal regional airlines and has far fewer international flights and even if it could fly more international routes, it lacks the equipment to do so.
he even gets to land a traditional boeing customer (garuda international) but at the risk of sounding anti-airbus and pro-boeing, there is a bit more to this story in my opinion.
i think we’ll see a largish order from latam and it will be for an airliner to replace aircraft on both the brazilian and chilean side of the airline.
airlines put off buying large quantities of aircraft for quite a long time  and now the legacy airlines not only want them, they need them.
well, for the committed airbus customer, going deep on the a320neo isn’t quite as foolish because it is fairly obvious that airbus *won’t* have a replacement for the a320neo as soon as 2025.
mcnerney acknowledges that us airways  hasn’t bought boeing in a some time and sees aa as a loyal boeing  customer as well.
then, later in the day, the rumours started flying that it would announce the order today (wednesday).
airbus’ introduction of the neo made it much more imperative to deliver  more efficiency now rather than a decade later.
some might be tempted to think it’s a bluff, i do not think it is anything resembling a bluff.

i wouldn’t say this is a done deal
it needs replacement aircraft for the remaining 737-300/500 aircraft in the fleet and that is being achieved with 737-800s (which replace 737-700s which then replace 737-300/500 aircraft.)
2011 also saw long term ceo gerard arpey depart the company (to work with former continental ceo larry kellner) and aa president tom horton took over.
i don’t see a real strong suitor for frontier except, perhaps, jetblue but since frontier isn’t based at jfk airport, i do wonder at jetblue interest in an airline like frontier.
take the bombardier cseries vs airbus a319neo scenario that is unfolding.
when you have a competitive environment, customers change from time to time.
one example is that the 737 already has winglets (aka “sharklets” on the a320).
fuel price volatility will continue to be a problem.
right now, it needs the 737-800 and it needs it now rather than later.
the bombardier cseries presents just a touch too much threat in the future.
but with the decision made, i also have to credit boeing for appearing to  have decided to go all in.
filed under: airline news by ajax no comments » boeing has revealed more details on its definition for the 737max now and one significant revelation is the decision to add 8 inches to the nose gear.
i repeat, boeing really needs to get back into the game.
it’s a mainliner by any definition and one based on a design that is 20+ years old.
us airways has stopped fuel hedging and their financial results show that fuel hedging just may not be necessary anymore.
embraer has got a nice grip on the regional airliner business but it also has a problem in that, right now, there is no growth path into a larger plane for purchasers.
i think delta will continue to make a big pile of money with very little controversy surrounding it except that i think delta will look for and execute a plan to encroach on more legacy and superlegacy airline routes as it has announced its intention to do so from la guardia airport.
i don’t  think the decisions they are now announcing about this aircraft reflect a  company that is struggling to maintain the status quo in the marketplace.
so  that they could buy them, operate them for a few years and sell them at a  profit.
expect other superlegacy airlines to take a long, hard look at this deal and begin to negotiate for their own superdeals on aircraft with both manufacturers.
quite a bit actually.
it would have been a difficult challenge but it is one that boeing is in position to achieve.
the question is whether or not boeing is taking american seriously in this.
on the one hand, airbus coo john leahy gets to make good on his prediction of 500+ committments to the a320neo by the paris air show.
filed under: aircraft development by ajax no comments » airbus and boeing need to sell march 8, 2012 on 4:40 pm | in aircraft  development |
in fact, it presently is the only airliner that does.
the truth is that the emerging economies are largely dependent upon demand from both europe and north america and neither of those economies will see high growth in 2012.
i  firmly believe that boeing was leaning towards a new aircraft but also needed  time and space to get where it needed to be with that aircraft.
airbus need to work hard getting their current production sold until their  aircraft are in place but without depreciating values and without massive  discounts to encourage orders.
some perceive that boeing has been slow to release details and i understand  that perception but the truth is that american airlines’ order last  summer forced their hand into a premature announcement.
i think we’ll see capacity restraint for another year and higher air fares than seen in a long, long time.

and bombardier is making the aircraft.
instead, he’ll suggest stripper poles could be installed on ryanair aircraft.
boeing will be biding its time on improvements to the 777 until it sees more definition of the a350-1000 and it will throw its resources into ramping up 787 production, 787-9 development and 737max development.
somehow, i severely doubt that a boeing led by someone such as alan mulally would have adopted such a strategy.
the 737-800 is a good fit as a md-80 replacement but not as a 757 replacement.
it’s time for a decision and enough time has passed to make that decision.
airbus would struggle with that without making a much larger investment in a new line (such as in the united states.)
and i think it will be the 737max and 777-300er.
if aa had a fully modern fleet now, it’s likely it would not have lost money this past quarter.
i think it will be a partial fleet replacement with lots of options for incremental change in the fleet.
that’s the airliner that it really needs to go deep on.
is the airbus a320/a321 the right aircraft?
and i think it will be small(ish) if anything.
at the end of the day, most airlines prefer to see results over having a grand announcement.
but i think they’ll concede the need to develop a larger airliner as well.
they *seem* like a new aircraft.
milwaukee will become the regional airport it was intended to be instead of a bloody battleground between lcc airlines.
klm/air france: i see nothing here at all.
as much as boeing and airbus would like to think so, they don’t.
it will maintain a large fleet of nextgen 737s for the next 10 years or more.
southwest has a fairly new, fairly efficient fleet of 737s and it will want to keep buying new aircraft, too.
picking your fights is an art.
yes, that means md-80s
and a market glut of aircraft can result in depreciating demand for your new generation aircraft because the capital costs for current generation aircraft can become low enough to make sense for airlines to buy and use.
if it does succeed, that success will begin in europe as well as for airlines of lesser developed areas such as the middle east, india and the far east.
the aircraft cannot be polished like its 737 counterparts.
why did airbus win more orders?
but what does it need?
they are working very, very hard to bring as  much advantage as possible to the single aisle wars with airbus.
i actually think that virgin atlantic will have to find an airline alliance to join and if i’m right, i would lay very heavy odds on it being the star alliance.
particularly in atlanta.
if there is one thing  boeing knows, it’s that they cannot afford to damage their credibility  with airlines further with a late arrival of the 737max.  this is not an  all new aircraft with all new materials and airlines will expect it on time or  early.
at least a little bit, yes.
if this happens, oneworld and american airlines gets kicked in the groin in south america.
in fact, airlines are being much more prudent in their orders by ordering a few here and a few there to just keep pace with their conservative needs.
this might be good for aa, it isn’t good, necessarily for southwest airlines or ryanair.
the financial crisis on that continent will make it very hard to earn an honest profit and middle eastern airlines will continue to erode the long haul traffic that european airlines have enjoyed for decades.
it didn’t need quite as many 737s.
airlines haven’t been able to plan their costs very effectively for the past 3 years.
boeing will simply add more and more substantiation to their  claims as they continue discussions with airlines.
arguably japan has it.
look for an order announcement in the next 1 to 3 months and my bet is on a 200 to 250 aircraft order of 737s with about 100 of those coming from the 737max line.
well, for one, the cost to announce this order was tiny compared to a traditional order.
one thing is sure, the comac 919 isn’t going to deliver what ryanair needs and certainly not on time.
airbus execus fight like bulldogs even when someone just happens to walk nearby.
the sweet spot its lineup offers will become more attractive to airlines once they see bombardier actually perform in the development and test of this aircraft.
i do think the a321neo will be the 757-ish replacement and i do not think that aa will upsize aircraft to the 737-900er down the line.
air india has already become the new alitalia.
i suspect that if doug parker is able to re-assure boeing over its existing  aa orders, boeing will go neutral or even supportive of such a merger.
while i don’t expect quite the same delay as the 787 saw, it will be a significant delay and it will impact airbus.
however, this is a pretty big loss for boeing in the psychological warfare arena of aircraft sales.
airbus managed a coup by forcing boeing’s hand and scaring them away from a new design.
sooner or later, ryanair will have to make a move on a next generation 737max or a320neo.
it’s westernized, it’s flying and it does feel like its the right size.
first, it is time to stop behaving like a teenager in this rivalry that exists with boeing.
i think its labor force is about to take a beating on wages and benefits and i think the resulting bitterness will last for years.
as if that wasn’t enough, it made a firm deal on a bunch of 737max aircraft and agreed to take on even more 737-800 aircraft for its routes.
for 2012, more explosions and more governmental heads will push even deeper into the sand.
instead of repudiating the c919, michael o’leary will just quit talking about it.
there is absolutely, positively, no question that boeing needs to get back in the game asap.
this has credence due to the fact that united has about 200 aircraft that are some of the oldest around (these are 757s and 737s mostly from the original united airlines) and those aircraft are likely having a real impact on the bottom line as a result of fuel costs and maintenance.
they’ll continue to succeed and be smart in their attempts to gain more dominance in more parts of the world.
neither works for mainline service very well because they’re heavy for the number of passengers they carry and their range just isn’t needed for routes requiring those passenger numbers.
i think we’ll see an order and i suspect that order may well go all to boeing.
this only makes sense as the gains are more than enough to justify the purchases and now is the time to gain an advantage in bargaining with both boeing and airbus.
southwest will get its deal and boeing needs southwest to stamp approval on the max.
current demand isn’t from growth, it’s simply from the need to replace aging airliners and the thoughts of ramping up production to 50+ per month does smack of hubris.
however, their arj21 is a non-starter since it is heavy and, you know, no one has really ordered it except chinese airlines who were told to order it.
the sukhoi superjet, on the other hand, has a real chance, i think.
airbus has pitted its a319neo against the cs300 as the better aircraft and i’d like to point something out.
more likely, airbus wouldn’t roll such an aircraft out until 2030.
the orders its racked up so far are fairly paltry and at risk, in my opinion.
both manufacturers know that their order books are soft.
check out what engine is on that aircraft.
no and i don’t think the manufacturers are going to commit to that presently.
yes, initial orders are high(ish) but consider this: annual production of the 737 and a320 already exceeds 800 aircraft a year.
you want to satisfy  airlines with new aircraft but some of those who buy aircraft are lessors and  you don’t want to anger them by depreciating their assets they already  hold.
airbus need to work hard getting their current production sold until their aircraft are in place but without depreciating values and without massive discounts to encourage orders.
boeing/mcdonnel douglas pitted the 717 against the embraer 170/190 and got its hat handed to them.
the market will become flooded with cheap, relatively new “classic” single aisle airliners with a new single aisle airliner introduction.
it would require another production line and even more suppliers for airliners that are now fairly obsolete in light of the a320neo and 737max.
tam has 27 a350-900s ordered and i think that order *might* be at risk.
southwest is doing this by buying the 737-800.
assuming it can take deliveries in 2017, that means the max stays in the fleet for as long as 2037 or longer.
boeing plays a bit more fair in this area in that it doesn’t “count” something as a committment until it is a firm order.
this is a nice launch for cfm and stands in contrast with order a320neo orders that have listed pratt pw1100g as their choice of engine.
but right now the cfm leap56 offers the same performance with great reliability and reduced risk for the owner.
it’s a highly complex, risky effort that doesn’t appear to be providing the benefits its supposed to.
boeing will simply add more and more substantiation to their claims as they continue discussions with airlines.
aerolineas argentinas?
is there another order for aircraft lurking in the background here?
filed under: airline fleets, airline news by ajax no comments » american airlines apparently is playing the ryanair game with both boeing and airbus by using a 250 aircraft orders as both a carrot and a stick.
until the world economies recover, the best the industry can hope to do is manage its problems and earn a bit of money.
american airlines is a great example and they’ve made their order.
my problem with this is that it simply confirms the airbus a320neo as the right move and offers boeing little advantage over the next 10 to 15 years and possibly puts it at a disadvantage over that time frame since there are fewer areas to incrementally improve performance of that airframe over time.
say what you want (like it doesn’t include any us network carriers or boeing customers), they put it up there in 6 months and they did it much like boeing did the 787 orders.
some are older than those inefficient 737-300 aircraft and no longer have the fuel efficiency that the latest airbus offerings possess.
these are efficient, for their time, but very inefficient when compared to the latest modesl coming off boeing’s line.
airlines such as southwest realize that a smaller airliner is probably necessary for growth now that they have the nation’s largest cities essentially covered.
so what does it mean?
the merged airline would, upon conclusion, have far more boeing aircraft and far more resources to service and operate boeing aircraft than airbus aircraft.
it’s possible that we’ll see a real 787-10 announcement in 2012 but, if so, probably not until the latter part of the year.
once the performance of that aircraft is established, i think we’ll see orders from us and european airlines come in large numbers.
2011 was largely a “rebuilding” year for the airline industry.
this is an airline that 6 years later is still effectively operating as two airlines (under one name).
what it doesn’t really have anymore is that 70’s/80’s fleet of aircraft with really inefficient engines a la md-80s and what it does have in that category, it’s getting rid of fast.
there is one more question lingering as well . . .
furthermore, it even gives boeing an “in” with the us airways  executive team that it has not had for some time.
and it’s got to work hard to deliver on those.
so far, they’re  impressed but what they’ve seen of the 737max so far does not.
the a320neo and 737max aircraft are interim solutions.
a full mix of a319/320/321 aircraft with multiple bases or b) a320/a321 aircraft with focused bases i rather doubt that the a319 or the b737-700 will be ordered at all.
something like that becomes much more likely in 2013.
reacting isn’t always good.
it’s a tall order and a difficult challenge for both manufacturers.
if i were bombardier, i would be knocking on american airlines’ door with a most excellent finance package for its cseries cs100 and cs300.
building a first time, competitive single aisle mainline aircraft requirese a body of experience that china doesn’t have.
to be fair, even the 737ng is getting a bit long in the tooth and promising incremental improvements isn’t going to satisfy airlines anymore.
the middle east after ordering an insane amount of widebodies in 2011, emirates will order another insane amount of widebody aircraft and beat up on boeing about its 747-8i.
furthermore, both airlines have orders for airbus a320neo aircraft already.
they appear to be working very hard to make every gain possible against their competitors to bring even more to the table.
if you’re an airbus customer and you need a single aisle airliner, you’re pretty much going to order the neo.
the oldest a320 series aircraft are now due for replacement as well.

and there is no airliner being offered that quite gets the airlines there.
it has serious impacts from labor groups who cannot agree on what day it is much less on who represents them with the company (this would be the pilots) and it still doesn’t have a combined seniority list with one agreement in place with both the pilots and the flight attendants.
in addition, this is the creeping incrementalism that we saw at mcdonnell douglas over nearly a 2 decade time period that led to their ultimate demise.
i say that that statement is ryanair standing up and yelling “look at me!
i don’t think we’ll see more consolidation in south america
fighting off bombardier and embraer just expends money on low return investments.
most see latam going with oneworld and while i can’t disagree with the arguments, i think that skyteam and/or star alliance might just swoop in with one hell of a package that may be too hard to resist.
and i’m not even sure that exists.
embraer gets close but it doesn’t quite get there.
now that airlines know what is going to happen with both the airbus a320 series and boeing 737 series aircraft, they can start shopping for that next class of aircraft that permits entry into those smaller markets cost effectively.
however, the airline wasn’t without some trouble: airtran pilots tried real hard to step on their on feet in a seniority deal with southwest airline pilots.
no huge numbers but large enough to make a splash.
i do wonder how much longer lufthansa can rely upon its a340 aircraft and somewhat expect lufthansa to bite the bullet and buy the 777.
an airliner series with practical passenger capacities ranging from 90 to 130 seats is just what these airlines need.
there will continue to be volatility but i don’t think we’ll see anything like 2008/2009.
both boeing and airbus need to find ways to preserve value on existing aircraft lines until their new generation aircraft enter into service as well.
airbus has sold most of those positions.
i was certain that we would hear other airlines grumble about being kept out of the loop or shout with joy that they, too, wanted to order the aircraft.
instead, they went down.
this is not an all new aircraft with all new materials and airlines will expect it on time or early.
simply put, delta is replacing exactly what needs replacement and not buying one aircraft more than necessary.
the aircraft of choice will be, i think, the airbus a320neo
furthermore, i think boeing may be able to offer earlier delivery positions than airbus can.
but with the decision made, i also have to credit boeing for appearing to have decided to go all in.
the a320neo is something that american needs more than most network airlines.
even if the legacy and superlegacy airlines get pilots to agree to new scope clauses that permit them to engage regional airlines for that 90 to 130 seat flying, somebody has to buy the aircraft and fly them.
it’s learning curve with new materials and design approaches has peaked.
i think we’ll see alaska airlines find even more odd partners for its success and still manage to cozy up close to delta while doing it.
the a319 and 737-700 seat roughly 135 or more passengers.
airbus’ introduction of the neo made it much more imperative to deliver more efficiency now rather than a decade later.
their size (and the size of  several competitors) demand manufacturing positions that can’t be  serviced exclusively by one manufacturer.
for a tiny bit more in costs, southwest can fly significantly more passengers on routes that are seeing enormous demand.
this is a big win for cfm and its leap56 engine and while the engine is only announced for the 737re, it is almost certain that that engine will be chosen for the a320 family.
virgin atlantic didn’t die, didn’t find new partners and didn’t extricate itself from the chokehold that singapore airlines has on it.
we’re already seeing it in some airlines such as american airlines who has finally realized that if it dumps its md-80 aircraft, it can not only enjoy double digit improvements in fuel efficiency, it can fly more people as well.
delta has a fairly mixed fleet with both boeing and airbus products.
furthermore, airlines need to hedge against their labor costs which will only grow over time.
but they are going away because they are fuel inefficient and they’re getting old to boot.
it’s a design that many see risky given its complexity.
filed under: airline news by ajax no comments » world alliances i’m not sure we’ll see much in this territory for skyteam or star alliance.
airlines put off buying large quantities of aircraft for quite a long time and now the legacy airlines not only want them, they need them.
they can make more money for a tiny incremental cost in fuel and one additional flight attendant.
so, at best, the max is an interim solution for airines like southwest (and ryanair and others) and you don’t go deep on interim solutions.
in addition, boeing  has and continues to support aa’s purchases for aircraft in a variety of  ways.
say goodbye to the older 737s.
boeing ceo james mcnerney expressed his and boeing’s viewpoint that they support american airlines having an opportunity to exit their bankruptcy as a stand alone company.
third, when you look at who these committments come from, it isn’t game changing.
the capital costs are low compared to current boeing aircraft and the airliner provides close to current boeing efficiencies.
in addition, i think we may well see a follow on order for the 737max aircraft again in the -800/-900 configurations.
if it does turn out to be a robust engine with good lifecycle costs, it may well be the leader going forward.
the strategy of using airbus for narrow bodies and boeing for wide bodies seems to be a smart one for airlines in that region.
however, let’s not forget that fuel is a problem for *every* airline.
one great example is lion airways order from  boeing.
it will fit almost all of the missions the 757 is currently serving (except for trans-atlantic flights) and it will do it with pretty good efficiency compared to what boeing is offering right now.
but does it need the 737-max?
electronic bleed air will be added to improve cabin pressurization (which is much like how the a350 will use bleed air)and better means more efficient fuel burn.
if it is and if there is an order, it will be a major blow to boeing.
hedging is supposed to “smooth” that volatility and it will except that it also causes paper losses which reflect negatively on the airline when it announces its financial performance.
i do expect ryanair to make an order and i do think it will be the 737max.
iag also managed to get a tentative deal to buy bmi from lufthansa and become the emperor of slots at london heathrow . . .
for most airlines, going deep on the a320neo is the wrong decision.
and now we know why john leahy was hinting at boeing losing a major network carrier.
their profits are not taking a hit from hedging contracts that “lose” money.
in fact, us airways performance is exceptional when balanced against the challenges it has.
i would expect that we’ll see a number of these begin to be retired or sold off for cargo work.
i expect to see an initial southwest order for 100 to 200 aircraft sometime in the next 6 months.
one thing is sure, the comac  919 isn’t going to deliver what ryanair needs and certainly not on  time.
i’m talking about 2002/2003 time periods which were a result of september 11, 2001 attacks that reduced air traffic dramatically and killed the finances of airlines around the world.
this may well be the “major network carrier” that airbus coo john leahy has spoken of with respect to the a320neo.
this order will be of dramatic benefit for the airline when it comes to saving on fuel.
you want to satisfy airlines with new aircraft but some of those who buy aircraft are lessors and you don’t want to anger them by depreciating their assets they already hold.
they’ve made it out like the a320neo is a no-brainer for development and while it is an incremental improvement, the engineering to deliver is non-trivial.
