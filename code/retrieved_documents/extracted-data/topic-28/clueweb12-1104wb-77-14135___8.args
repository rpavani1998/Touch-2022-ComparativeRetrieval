airbus provided an a330/a340 market update during its innovation days presentations in hamburg earlier in may.
boeing continues to dominate the headlines with its troubled 787 program, so we’ll look at the us aerospace company first.
this will further aid the cash flow shortfalls from the a380 program.
delta air lines may cancel the 787 ordered by northwest airlines now that nwa is a subsidiary of delta.
the global financial market meltdown last year hopes for recovery this year but the global economy is questionable.
this has the makings for being a year of recovery in new airplane programs.

our own checks suggest that a new development and testing timeline for the critical software systems is aimed for a sooner-than-later second quarter first flight (the old timeline suggested a june-august timeline for first flight).
what is important to emphasize here is that this date is an internal timeline and boeing is only saying first flight will be in the second quarter.
along with maintenance procedure changes to the a330, the a340 increases the interval on the a check to 800 flight hours from the current 600; c check intervals go from 18 months to 21-24 months; intermediate checks increased from five years at eis to the current six years and remains unchanged; and structural checks increase from 10 years to 12 years.
car’s first conference brought together nearly every appraisal company then in existence in the us to compare and discuss appraisals of what was called enhanced equipment trust certificates (eetcs) and appraisals published by the firms.
the details may be found in thisap story.
this means it could take place on june 30 and still meet the publicly stated goal.
airbus is tweaking the a340 with some aerodymic improvements designed to reduce fuel burn by 1%.
not likely, either, because the 777 has a four year backlog and is being produced at the rate of seven a month, its highest ever.
we’ve been involved in the airline business since 1979 and from 1990, when we co-owned commercial aviation report (car), have followed the appraisal business.

this is hardly good news.
given the discussion in “comments,” we think a dedicated post is worthwhile.

boeing and the airlines will have to cope as best they can.
these are obviously critical milestones in the recovery of the 787 program and boeing’s operations.

boeing says the first flight will be in the second quarter; air transport world first reported that april 20 is now the schedule for first flight andflightblogger followed with its own reporting on a timeline leading to this date.
airbus’ a350 does, too.
our own checks suggest that a new development and testing timeline for the critical software systems is aimed for a sooner-than-later second quarter first flight (the old timeline suggested a june-august timeline for first flight).
nwa ordered 18, but delta’s ceo richard anderson is unhappy with the delays and performance issues (the 787 is overweight and has a shorter range than originally advertised, though the extent of the latter is in dispute).
boeing is looking for 777s, 767s and even airbus a330s and a340s with little luck.
our checks also report, however, that april 20 is thought to be aggressive and our sources are unsure this date can be met.
5 comments update, january 10: bloomberg news reports eads says it will be three years after the a400m’s first test flight–which remains unscheduled–before airbus will ship the airplane to customers.
that was hardly the point; because of delays and cash flow shortfalls in the a380 program, airbus really had little choice.
the used airplane market is very tight.

(that boeing is now considering boosting the 737 production seems to demonstrate airbus was right about the market demand, too.)

the production rates are: 737: ~30/mo 747: 1/mo 767: 1/mo 777: 7/mo 787: planned–initially 3/mo, increasing to 10/mo within 18 mounfilled orders by model through february 2008 enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.
no new joint bca-ids program is without significant issues and two of bca’s three new airplane projects have significant delays.
boeing is looking for 777s, 767s and even airbus a330s and a340s with little luck.
anderson likes the 777lr and it’s possible there could be a deal for more 777lrs to replace the 787-8s ordered by nwa.
a cancellation will be nothing but a minor embarrassment for boeing—with 900 orders, losing 18 won’t matter much and it’s possible others will come forward to grab these in any event.

airbus provided an a330/a340 market update during its innovation days presentations in hamburg earlier in may.
a couple of take-aways: this better performance, despite the worries over the dollar-euro exchange rate, slower-than-desired progress in power8 cost-cutting and new issues with a380 production, may make it more difficult to get cuts from the already recalcitrant labor unions; and the a320 family, where higher production rates have kicked in (and going higher still) has proved to be a key to the airbus recovery and cash flow.
