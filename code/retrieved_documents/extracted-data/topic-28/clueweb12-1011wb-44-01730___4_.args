at the same time, this partnership has engendered a degree of loyalty from an airline which constantly scores highly in customer satisfaction ratings.to emerge from boeing’s shadow and take up the position of market-leader which it enjoys today, airbus has had to make the most of the technological expertise available in europe as well as pursue sound development and marketing strategies both at home and abroad.nonetheless, by applying the principles which have made airbus successful, companies would be able to go some way to remaining competitive over coming years.the a380, for example, was billed as a great technological leap forward that would, in time, revolutionise air travel and reduce cost and per passenger fuel consumption for airlines.government interference, so often a hindrance to european companies forced to consider political as well as economic factors, has been to the company’s advantage, allowing it to avoid the industrial action which has hampered boeing in recent years.in airbus’s case, research, development and manufacturing take place in european countries (although some production does take place in taiwan) with the added advantage of protecting the company’s intellectual property rights – something which is not always possible for those with large factories in the far east.such conditions will not necessarily be easy to replicate by other european manufacturers – airbus is fortunate that the air travel industry involves innovative engineering and it interests european governments.such strategy could prove useful in years to come and certainly helped airbus in the first months after the a380 was completed when high-profile problems threatened to ruin the project.by accepting this, the company has been able to make the most of it; when it was developing the a380, airbus asked engineers in different locations to work independently of each other and then pooled the best ideas from each, creating an internal market and thus strengthening the final product.however, rather than making it available to all interested buyers on release, airbus elected to enter into an exclusivity agreement with singapore airlines, thus gaining the aircraft a reputation for luxury and service quality.even better for airbus was the enthusiasm of companies based in emerging markets, particularly china and india, which provided the impetus for deals that will secure much needed jobs in the british, german, spanish and french factories.furthermore, keeping production in europe has allowed to build a particular culture in europe, in which design, innovation and manufacturing arms all work closely together.the fact the company is currently researching and developing other aircraft also indicates that there may yet be more to come; the ‘grizzly’ military transport aircraft, although not present in paris due to gearbox trouble, is expected to garner multiple orders from governments both inside and outside the european union, providing the company with a product line in an area of the market where it has not traditionally excelled.airbus is now able to reap the rewards of the government meddling in its past, although such interference could only be described as endemic in its early history.the seemingly endless supply of cheap labour in china has, at least until workers there catch up with those in the west in wage terms, put an end to any hopes europeans may still harbour of returning to a pre-eminent position in the world of mass production.
