16-18% fuel burn improvement over 737 classics.

for an airline of air france’s credit, lease rates are typically on the 0.80% range and sometimes as low as 0.72%.
in addition to the airbus position, it should also be noted that at least one airline analysis of the max vs neo concludes that max will only be around 2% better than neo, not the 7%-8% lower operating costs claimed by boeing.
but boeing revealed a little bit more detail on the 737 max vs the a320 neo that suggests their analysis gives another percentage point advantage than was originally announced last august.
