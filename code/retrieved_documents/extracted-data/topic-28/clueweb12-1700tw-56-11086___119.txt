would pay for being there.
and i've seen plenty of topless women in sxm but nothing comes close to a 747 coming directly in your direction just a few hundred feet below you!
the way you've  captured coming straight towards you over the runway is fantastic!!!

i've had a couple very similar shots, though not with the 747.

a visitor from united states posted fri february 11, 2011: it is a great shot - how was it taken - where was the photographer - it almost makes you unsteady since it it hard to get used to a 747 coming straight up at you - again where was the photographer to get this fantastic perspective?

a visitor from united states posted sun november 19, 2006: this is one of, no is the best shot, on a.net.
would love to know the details of how this shot came to be.
its a great  optical illusion, but no fake!
i'm no expert on photography so this makes me wonder, "how in the world...?
thank you for that special shot.
but how come the plane looks so small compared to the runway width?

a visitor from netherlands posted wed july 14, 2010: bizarrely wonderful!
how on earth can a photo like this be taken?
amazing frame(s) of reference...there is a cognitive dissonance to seeing an airplane seemingly rise from an opposite plane(a 'plane'/runway that looks like a kid's charcoal drawing)and head straight for the camera...
the best of aviation by member smithnl my selection of the best pictures on airliners.net, with a bit more interest for dutch airlines.
i know this is one of the best pictures on a.net!!!!
in  addition one wonders how the photograph was taken or staged.
a visitor from brazil posted tue october 16, 2007: i  think that this pic was shot in a routine 747 take-off, but the man behind the  camera would cause envy to salvador dali, due to the distorted proportions and  real impact of the image.
you can clearly see the power capabilities of the engines and huge wing bending moments.
those old b744 a/c are awsome.

easily one of the most amazing photos in the database!
light, angle and the perspective.
in 1928, the los angeles city council selected 640 acres in the southern part of westchester as the site of a new airport for the city.
