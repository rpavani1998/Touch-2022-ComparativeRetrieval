the capital costs are low compared to current boeing aircraft and the airliner provides close to current boeing efficiencies.it could fly fantastic distances but without enough passengers to make it cost effective.now that airlines know what is going to happen with both the airbus a320 series and boeing 737 series aircraft, they can start shopping for that next class of aircraft that permits entry into those smaller markets cost effectively.the real challenge in this aircraft is ensuring support and with boeing as a consultant, it may well have some help in that arena.the merged airline would, upon conclusion, have far more boeing aircraft and far more resources to service and operate boeing aircraft than airbus aircraft.what those airlines have learned is that neither boeing nor airbus has a supply chain that can meet all their needs all of the time and on time.superlegacy airlines will own enough of an aircraft/engine family to enjoy economies of scale and it is no longer necessary to try to maximize cost benefits by sticking to one aircraft type and one engine.my problem with this is that it simply confirms the airbus a320neo as the right move and offers boeing little advantage over the next 10 to 15 years and possibly puts it at a disadvantage over that time frame since there are fewer areas to incrementally improve performance of that airframe over time.this has credence due to the fact that united has about 200 aircraft that are some of the oldest around (these are 757s and 737s mostly from the original united airlines) and those aircraft are likely having a real impact on the bottom line as a result of fuel costs and maintenance.if o’leary and company wish to continue to operate a successful ulcc, they’ll be lining up to buy them as well because they do offer the kind of incremental gain in efficiency that is going to make the world’s legacy airlines much more competitive with ulcc’s like ryanair.other than the ability to “concentrate” more passengers onto a single flight, the a380 doesn’t offer these airlines anything more than what they already have in their current and planned fleets.in fact, it often only got capital for new investment if that investment benefitted its owners in the form of jobs programs for their citizens.the a319 offers a bit more flexibility on payload and range but the cseries would offer better trip costs most likely.initial orders will reflect some pent up demand to replace aircraft but it’s unlikely that the pace will continue in a sustained manner.their size (and the size of several competitors) demand manufacturing positions that can’t be serviced exclusively by one manufacturer.
