the a-350-1000 only has about 75 orders, or so.
“it appears that airbus is willing to let boeing have the lower end of the widebody market, while it concentrates on the high end.
while the a330-200 will cost more to operate than the 787-8, the larger passenger and cargo capacity will generate more revenue and make the aircraft more profitable, airbus argues.
but it may have to struggle against the a-3510 if airbus improves that model to more of what the me airlines want, not in its “new” current form.
best price for 787 seems to have been $67m ( for an average of $76m for about the first 400 sales).
that already appears to be the case for both the 787-8 and the a350-800, with the lack of orders for both a/p’s.
on topic the a350-800 as a shrink from the -900 will no doubt be heavier then the 787-9 as a stretch of the 787-8.
the conclusion comes following the announcement at the paris air show that the -800 will be delayed two years and the a350-1000 by 18 months.
prices are with engines but without buyer furnished equipment.
@ewe: “boeing floats the -10 on a regular basis without creating tangible interest ( done for taking focus away from the -8 is my guess ).
the b-787-10, if it ever becomes a reality will need a bigger wing, more powerful engines (maybe the rr trent-xwb?), and stronger mlg.
only boeing could or would not bring it off.
the numbers are somewhat skewed because bernstein doesn’t separate the a330-300 out into the 777 marketplace.
aviation history confirms, that if an aircraft is not too big when it goes into service, within reason, it will soon be too small!
i believe both the b-787 and a-350 will be successful airplanes, although for different reasons.
but, to bernstein’s disappointment, the passenger capacity remains the same at 350.
well the -10 isn’t really being offered yet per se so its hard for boeing to offer it like the a359….
yes, both have composits as their fuselarge, but the b-787 also uses that for the wings, the a-350 does not, it uses a metal wing.

while slightly more than 100 orders remain and airbus denied market questions about whether the -800 will survive, one aerospace analyst would view cancellation of the -800 in a positive light.
it will probibly be true for the a-330, b-777, etc.
i’ll agree, the world freighter market (excluding military cargo and tanker aircraft) is not huge, a current backlog of less than 300 aircraft, spread among the a-332f, b-763erf, b-772lrf, and b-747-8f.

many of the a350s which airbus will deliver are at the discounted price of the original a350…talk about discounts.
“it appears that airbus is willing to let boeing have the lower end of the widebody market, while it concentrates on the high end.
bearing in mind the a350-800 on its own competes against both the 787-8 and the 787-9, a350-800 sales aren’t impressive.

airbus denies is plans to cancel the -800, which competes with the boeing 787-9.
also, 6-7 years ago, the b787 list prices were much less then they are now.. …and to think airbus isn’t “insidious only their scheme “…please… i wrote about the immiment but not much advertised a380-900 as a comparison to the number girl 787-10
the xwb gets a black wing.
all that “revolutunary high tech” was just fireworks for the great unwashed public.
here is the story we did last week for commercial aviation online.
boeing dominates the upper middle-twin aisle deliveries with the 777 while airbus holds a slight lead in the lower twin-aisle markets.
intriguing, we know what’s happening in the nb segment and boeing hasn’t delivered a single passenger vla for the last 6 yrs & has a backlog of a few dozen.
the numbers are somewhat skewed because bernstein doesn’t separate the a330-300 out into the 777 marketplace.
date: 06/07/2011 10:29 bernstein research, in a 1 july report on eads focusing on airbus, sees a risk of cancellation of the a350-800 – a move that it views “positively”.
date: 06/07/2011 10:29 location: seattle by: scott hamilton bernstein research, in a 1 july report on eads focusing on airbus, sees a risk of cancellation of the a350-800 – a move that it views “positively”.
none have been ordered since airbus officially anounced the improvement package at last month’s pas, even though word was out before then (by scott).
i don’t know that there will be a b-787-10, boeing has been riding the fence of that model.
airbus believes the 787 is generally sized too small and seems content to let the a330-200—which is slightly larger than the 787-8—defend this market segment.
but, to bernstein’s disappointment, the passenger capacity remains the same at 350.
apropos uwe, apologize about the misspelling of your name… well, ok, but be more carefull next time or i send my minions ( http://www.ironsky.com boeings “say so” is in contrast to reality on a regular basis.
i think the comment regarding “giving away the plane” was in lieu of the fact had boeing known in advance they would have sold so many frames, they wouldn’t have as heavily discounted the launch frames.
airbus rescheduled the -1000 in order to allow rolls-royce to provide a slightly larger engine to enable the aircraft to go another 400nm with an increased payload.
the b-777′s early success is partly because the md-11 never did meet its promised performance goals, and the a-342/3 had poor hot runway performance.
boeing, however, is not willing to cede the high end to airbus.”
yes they have lost customers-but it certainly isn’t due to the b787′s capabilities-more to do with the fact many of the carriers simply cannot afford to purchase the plane or have had a change in business plans.
over the years i have come to the conclusion that boeing wanted to bind potential airbus customers at all costs and by all means thinkable but never planned beyond i.e. to be actually able to fullfill that orderbook instead hoping for a major contraction during the then looming us^h^hgfc which wasn’t all that unexpected as most people seem to think.
thats about 50% of an already floored listprice i think ( based on realistically unachievable ( not only in hindsight ) production simplifications.
if so, history may well repeat itself, because airbus coming out with the a350 after boeing launched the 787, had the benefit of improving on the existing 787 design, as boeing did with the 777, three years after the md-11 and a340 had been launched, making the 777 the record breaking wide-body airplane it still is today!
bernstein views the -800 “as the least attractive of the family and believe it is ultimately at risk of cancellation—which we would view positively,” the 1 july report says.
….$76 is low, but it doesn’t include engines, etc.

it cannot stay at the same weight as the b-787-9.
some of the numbers i’ve read for both the a350 and a380 are inclusive…..and again, without being tautological, many of the a350 orders are for the original “mark-i” version of the a350…and afaik, carriers such as qr will be paying the “mark-i” version..not the xwb version… of interest: “aspire aviation has learned one important contributing factor to boeing’s optimism in the payload/range performance, as well as the superior fuel burn performance of the 787-10x is the weight reduction opportunities being realised on the 787-9, which aspire aviation‘s source says is “moving ahead of the curve” with little to no overweight issue.”
hillinga: “appears to be in the stronger position compared to the 787-10 and that well may be the reason why boeing is having a tough time getting commitments for it!”
airbus delayed the -800, officials said, to concentrate resources on the a350-900.
while the a330-200 will cost more to operate than the 787-8, the larger passenger and cargo capacity will generate more revenue and make the aircraft more profitable, airbus argues.
i keep thinking airbus is the best but boeing seems to be leading.
airbus denies is plans to cancel the -800, which competes with the boeing 787-9.
the b-77w will eventually kill off the a-333, too.
while slightly more than 100 orders remain and airbus denied market questions about whether the -800 will survive, one aerospace analyst would view cancellation of the -800 in a positive light.
the 787-9 would be a more efficient platform.
adding freighters to suggest some balance is non-sense and even those haven’t sold well.
i believe the b-787-8 has about 450 to 500 orders, including the orders converted from the aborted b-787-3.
airbus delayed the -800, officials said, to concentrate resources on the a350-900.
i don’t see how the a-350 is an ‘improved’ design over the b-787.
but they are still new builds for each oem, and each one counts in the total sales record for that basic airplane (a-330, b-767, b-777, and b-747).
bernstein views the -800 “as the least attractive of the family and believe it is ultimately at risk of cancellation—which we would view positively,” the 1 july report says.
the boeing 787-8 and the morbid moribund 767 compete with the a330-200 for the lower end.
they have continuously lost customers for the -8(and -9)even though those frames were ordered at prices significantly below the competitions typical pricing (going through a max 910?
a visiting member of the royal saudi family, departed on one hot day from dfw to ruh in an a-342 also took up most of rwy 17r. but sales wise, the a-343 sold reasonable well, not so for a-342/5/6.
boeing floats the -10 on a regular basis without creating tangible interest ( done for taking focus away from the -8 is my guess ).
the conclusion comes following the announcement at the paris air show that the -800 will be delayed two years and the a350-1000 by 18 months.
airbus holds a slight lead in the single-aisle market and the very large aircraft segment.
so that would be about $100 for “full product”..
overall, boeing regains the market leadership next year as 787 and 747 deliveries finally kick in in earnest, retaining it through 2015, the last year of bernstein’s current projections.
airbus confirmed at the paris air show what we reported two weeks earlier, and that is the a350-1000 was going to be rescheduled to allow rolls-royce and airbus to tweak the airplane for more power, longer range and higher payload.
the a330-300 could go on for a bit longer – at least until the 787-10 comes on stream.
boeing, however, is not willing to cede the high end to airbus.”
my understanding is that all prices ( published list, rebated ) are sans engines and accessories and thus comparable ?
boeing dominates the upper middle-twin aisle deliveries with the 777 while airbus holds a slight lead in the lower twin-aisle markets.
based on what each has already sold, the b-787 about 800, and the a-350 about 550, each has proven to be what the customer airlines want.
i suspect airbus has been peddling the ‘improved’ a-3510 even before scott released his story here.
at dfw, the lh a-343 would, in the hot texas summer, use up over 12,000′ of our 14,300′ long runways as it departed at, or near its mtow.
but they certainly are insidious only their scheme didn’t work out as planned.
i also think airbus will cancel the a-358, as boeing did with the b-783.
http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/flightblogger/2010/12/the-price-of-boeings-787-sales.html respectively the complete pdf version: http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/flightblogger/2010/12/21/flightblogger-787-sales.pdf read, come back as has been said: the dreamliner sold for being a half price chinese copy of the a330.
in fact, to the contrary, boeing has been “telegraphing” for quite some time that a b787-10 will come out..it would be an excellent a333 replacement.
airbus holds a slight lead in the single-aisle market and the very large aircraft segment.
of course, but for the 747-8, it’s the starting sales years where freighters dominate, a first imo.
the boeing 787-8 and the morbid moribund 767 compete with the a330-200 for the lower end.
airbus has no effective response to the 787 in its segment.
overall, boeing regains the market leadership next year as 787 and 747 deliveries finally kick in in earnest, retaining it through 2015, the last year of bernstein’s current projections.
the brilliance of creative excretions of the marketing department.
apropos: delivery dates seem to continue their sled ride to the future: http://www.flightglobal.com/blogs/flightblogger/2011/07/boeing-holding-787-line-for-a.html http://nyc787.blogspot.com/2011/07/flightblogger-787-production-line-halt.html “airbus holds a slight lead in the single-aisle market and the very large aircraft segment.”
airbus, by delaying the a35-1000 to be powered with more powerful and newly developed rr engines, appears to be in the stronger position compared to the 787-10 and that well may be the reason why boeing is having a tough time getting commitments for it!
airbus believes the 787 is generally sized too small and seems content to let the a330-200—which is slightly larger than the 787-8—defend this market segment.
airbus rescheduled the -1000 in order to allow rolls-royce to provide a slightly larger engine to enable the aircraft to go another 400nm with an increased payload.
i don’t think boeing management is dumb.
