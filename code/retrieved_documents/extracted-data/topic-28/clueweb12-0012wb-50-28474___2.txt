airbus refers to this as  "xwb" or "xtra wide body" and states that from the point of  view of a seated passenger, the cabin is 5 inches wider at eye level than the  competing boeing 787.
the a350-900 is the first to enter service in 2013 and seats 314 passengers in a 3-class cabin.
this compares to the 787, which consists of 50% composites, 20% aluminium, 15% titanium, 10% steel and 5% the balance.
the proposed new a350 was to become more of a  competitor to the larger boeing 777 as well as the boeing 787, with a larger  fuselage cross-section able to accommodate 9 passengers per row in economy  class.
the original version of the a350 superficially resembled the a330 due to its common fuselage assembly.
it has a range of 8,000 nm (14,800 km).
it was to see entry into service in 2010 in two versions; the a350-800 capable of flying 8,800 nautical miles (16,300 km) with typical passenger capacity of 253 in 3-class configuration and the 300-seat (3-class) a350-900 with 7,500 nautical mile (13,890 km) range.
the airlines were not satisfied and airbus  committed euro4 billion to a new design to be called the a350.
as a result of these criticisms, in mid-2006 airbus undertook a major  review of the a350 concept.
the airlines pushed airbus to provide a competitor, as boeing had committed the 787 to have 20% lower fuel consumption than the a330.
airbus initially rejected this claim, stating that the 787 was itself just a reaction to the a330, and that no response was needed to the 787.
rolls-royce has agreed with airbus to supply a new variant of the trent engine for the a350 xwb, currently called the trent xwb, which will have a static thrust of 75000-95000 lbf.
late in 2006 a decision on formal launch was delayed as a result of delays  of the airbus a380.
a new wing, engines and a horizontal stabilizer were to be coupled  with new composite materials and production methods applied to the fuselage to  make the a350 an almost all-new aircraft.
its ceo, chew choon seng, said in a statement, that  "it is heartening that airbus has listened to customer airlines and has  come up with a totally new design for the a350."
the a330 and previous iterations of the a350 would only be able to accommodate 8 passengers per row in normal configurations.
this compares to the 787,  which consists of 50% composites, 20% aluminium, 15% titanium, 10% steel and 5%  the balance.
this differs slightly from the 787 design which uses ovoid skin  barrels on titanium ribs.
the airlines were not satisfied and airbus committed euro4 billion to a new design to be called the a350.
during 2007 paris air show, in a major boost for the program, airbus has  won firm orders for 141 a350 xwb.
it is the largest variant of the  a350 family and will seat 350 passengers in a 3-class cabin.
airbus responded by stating it was considering improvements for the a350 to satisfy customer demands.
at the same time, airbus then-ceo gustav humbert suggested that there would be no quick fixes, stating, "our strategy isn't driven by the needs of the next one or two campaigns, but rather by a long-term view of the market and our ability to deliver on our promises."
when boeing announced their 787 dreamliner project, they claimed the lower operating costs of this airplane would make it a serious threat to airbus' a330.
on september 16 2004, then airbus president and ceo noël forgeard  confirmed that a new project was under consideration, but did not give a  project name, and would not state whether it would be an entirely new design or  a modification of an existing product.
eads ceo thomas enders stated that the a350 program was not a certainty, citing  eads/airbus' stretched resources.
this version of the  a350 was planned to be a 250&endash;300-seat twin-engined widebody aircraft  derived from the design of the existing a330.
john  leahy refers to the old design as "airbus taper".
on june 14 2006, singapore airlines announced it had selected the 787 over the a350, ordering 20 787-9s.
on december 1 2006 the eads board agreed the  industrial launch of the sixth iteration a350 with costs mainly borne out of  cash-flow.
the a350 features composite wings, rear fuselage and fuselage skin (with  aluminium ribs), new engines, new landing gear and many new systems compared to  the a330.
in another change from the earlier a350 the fuselage is to be ovoid rather than circular.
john leahy refers to the old design as "airbus taper".
in june, 2007 airbus' john leahy has indicated that the genx engine will not feature on the a350, claiming that airbus wants ge to offer a more efficient version for the new airbus airliner.

on december 1 2006 the eads board agreed the industrial launch of the sixth iteration a350 with costs mainly borne out of cash-flow.
udvar-hazy called on airbus to bring a clean-sheet  design to the table, or risk losing most of the market to boeing.
on january 4 2007, airbus announced that pegasus aviation finance company  had placed the first firm order for the a350 xwb with an order for two  aircraft, though the variants were unspecified at the time.

the a350 fuselage will have a constant cross-section from door 1 to door 4,  unlike previous airbus aircraft.
however, on july 17 2006,  at the farnborough air show, airbus announced that the redesigned aircraft  would be called a350 xwb (xtra wide body).

during 2007 paris air show, in a major boost for the program, airbus has won firm orders for 141 a350 xwb.
although airbus previously suggested boeing's use of composite materials for the 787 fuselage was premature, and that the a350's would be made from aluminium-lithium, the a350xwb is to have a composite main fuselage skin on an al/al-li frame.
there was some speculation  that the revised aircraft would be called the airbus a370 or a280, with airbus  going as far as accidentally publishing an advert referring to the aircraft as  the "a280" on the financial times website.
all a350 xwb passenger models will have a range of at  least 8,000 nautical miles.
52% of the aircraft will be made out of composites, 20%  al/al-li, 14% titanium, 7% steel and 7% the balance.
it builds on the technologies developed for a380 and has a similar cockpit layout.

the a350 will have a fuselage cross-section wider than the original a350 which used the existing airbus widebody standard.
airbus has yet to decide whether the forward fuselage and cockpit will be  made from al/al-li or a one-piece composite structure, like the rear fuselage.
chew stated, "having gone to the trouble of designing a new wing, tail, cockpit" and adding advanced new materials, airbus "should have gone the whole hog and designed a new fuselage."
on october 6 2005 full industrial launch of the program was announced with an estimated development cost of around euro3.5 billion.
in april 2007, airbus chief executive louis gallois held face-to-face talks with senior general electric management over finalizing the possible go-ahead of a new variant of the genx engine for the a350 xwb.

airbus achieved its first sale of the redesigned a350 four days after its  unveiling when singapore airlines announced an order for 20 a350 xwbs with  options of a further 20.
initially airbus proposed a simple derivative of the a330, dubbed the a330-200lite, with improved aerodynamics and engines.

on march 28 2006, in the  presence of hundreds of top airline executives, steven f. udvar-hazy, of ilfc  lambasted airbus' strategy in bringing to market what they saw as "a  band-aid reaction to the 787," a sentiment which was echoed by gecas  president henry hubschman.
the xwb will impose a couple of years of delay into the original timetable and almost double development costs from $5.3 billion to approximately $10 billion.
at a press  conference december 4 2006 a few new technical details of the a350xwb design  were revealed, but no new customers were identified and john leahy indicated  existing a350 contracts were under re-negotiation due to increases in prices  compared to the original a350s contracted.
emirates decided against making an order for the a350 because of weaknesses in the design.
initially airbus  proposed a simple derivative of the a330, dubbed the a330-200lite, with  improved aerodynamics and engines.
several days later, similar comments were made by chew choon seng, ceo of singapore airlines.
it was  designed to be a direct competitor to the 787-9, and 777-200er.
however, boeing argues  that the a350-900 should not be compared to the 787-9 as it is considerably  larger.
on december 10 2004 the boards of eads and bae systems, then the  shareholders of airbus, gave airbus an "authorisation to offer  (ato)", and formally named it the a350.

the airlines pushed airbus to provide a competitor, as boeing had committed  the 787 to have 20% lower fuel consumption than the a330.
this is to provide maximum usable volume.
for the engines airbus has confirmed that they will retain a full bleed air system on their engines, rather than the bleedless configuration used on the 787.
ge has stated it will not offer the  gp7000 on the aircraft, and that previous contracts for the genx on the  original a350 did not apply to the xwb.
the a350-900  will enter service in 2013.
almost immediately airbus faced criticism on the a350 project by the heads  of two of its largest customers, ilfc and gecas.
