u.s. exports have been a rare bright spot in an otherwise sluggish economy, increasing by about 20 percent over the last two years and driving about half of all economic growth.more importantly, the idea that export subsidies will create jobs and increase gdp is yet another example of the single-entry-bookkeeping mentality that has larded the federal budget with so many subsidies and payments to special interests.as james explains, the bank not only picks winners and losers by guaranteeing the loans of private companies, but it also introduces unfair competition for all the u.s. firms that do not benefit from such special treatment.but here is one thing we know: boeing or any other aircraft manufacturer isn't going to survive just because they make the best product at the best price that the world has ever known.it is unseemly and i will never understand why anyone would think that it is a role of the federal government to help private companies make money, pay their employees, get loans, or produce goods or services at home or abroad.boeing, in turn, figured out that the only way airlines around the world would buy their planes over airbus is if they handed over the manufacture of the plane to the countries where these government-financed airlines were based.but along came a government consortium called airbus who could offer financing on their planes that no private company could match because the financing came from european governments who could just print the money they needed.according to the washington examiner ’s tim carney, in 2009, 90 percent of the loan guarantees issued by the bank went to subsidize boeing.with the help of the federal government guarantees, the company gained contracts from airlines like air china and air india.if a company can’t stay in business on its own, that is probably because it is trying to sell stuff that consumers don’t want to buy.but to answer your original question, what i know is that boeing has the best technology, and the best manufacturing know-how to build the 787, and they had to farm all of that work out to substandard companies around the world if they hoped to sell the airlines in those countries any of the their planes.this is an agency that is in the business of subsidizing private companies with taxpayer dollars.he writes: i had long insisted, to any liberals who would listen, that the supply-side revolution would be different from the corrupted opportunism of the organized business groups; that it would go after weak claims like boeing’s, not just weak clients such as food stamp recipients.also, while advocates for the programs claim that the bank takes risk that the private sector is unwilling to take (i wonder why the private sector will, year after year, pass up supposedly great opportunities), the bank’s lending activity is almost certainly irrelevant, since so few u.s. exports are supported through ex-im bank activities.not surprisingly, as a result, in 2011 boeing “accounted for 45.6%, or $40.7 billion, of exim’s total exposure in fiscal 2011.”
