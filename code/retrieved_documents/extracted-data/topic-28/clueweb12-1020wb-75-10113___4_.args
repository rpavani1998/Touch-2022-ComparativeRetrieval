they follow boeing and the supply chain and have their views on forecasting the needs of the suppliers.airport performance was important, especially at key airports.we have tremendous amount of confidence in our technology and at the end of the day it will be the most economical.the 747-8 engines are optimized for this aircraft despite the smaller fan size.the symposium is the first of its kind: a day-long event focused on forecasting the requirements in the supply chain that services boeing, other oems and the tier 1 suppliers.it has arranged trade missions from europe, asia and latin america visiting here to meet with washington state suppliers.ge and cfm have been very good in past in delivering products on time and meeting specifications.when max was announced, boeing claimed, “the airplane’s fuel burn is expected to be 16 percent lower than our competitor’s current offering and 4 percent lower than their future offering” and “it will have the lowest operating costs in the single-aisle segment with a 7 percent advantage over the competition.”this allows us to accelerate the retirement of older airplanes.cfm, of course, is the sole-source engine provider on the boeing 737 and has about half the market share on the airbus a320 family.we both would have liked a new airplane, but when you look at lessons learned [from 787] it was more challenging to bring to market in the timeframein the lawsuit between pratt & whitney and rolls-royce over patent claims for the engines powering the airbus a380, court documents revealed discounts as steep at 80% or more.but the iae v2500 is viewed as the better engine for the larger a321–more thrust and lower fuel burn–and american follows lufthansa airlines in splitting the engines for the smaller and larger airbus family.we’ve noted previously that the after-market is more important than the sale price of the engine where there is competition for a power plant.this report is the result of months of talking with customers and sources within boeing and cfm; and from public appearances by boeing and cfm.
