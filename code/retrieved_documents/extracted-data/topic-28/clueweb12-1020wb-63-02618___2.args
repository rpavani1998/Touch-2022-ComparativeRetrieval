the airbus order is only for the neo and 737 order is a mix of max and ngs.
but if airbus (and perhaps boeing) have to deeply discount sales of current airplanes to fill production slots, then this will depress values of the installed base.

brian hirshman, svp technical operations, told flightglobal pro on 15 december that the carrier is up-gauging its fleet, which it began doing this year with acquisition of the 737-800 for the first time.
ubs writes that boeing acknowledged lease rates and values of second hand aircraft will likely weaken as production rates ramp up.
the daily express of l0ndon (of all places) reported yesterday bca got the approval friday for the 737re and that the announcement is to come today.
the production rate is to increase in 2013 to 38 per months and to 42 the following year.

regardless as to where we are going to build the 737 max, you don’t want to get into a situation where we aren’t delivering narrowbodies.
precise details on the max remain uncertain; jim albaugh, ceo of boeing commercial airplanes, said engineering is still deciding whether to go for a 66-inch or 68-inch fan diameter for the cfm leap-1b. although albaugh said it is believe the larger fan still will not require a longer nose gear, with a ripple-effect of changes to the fuselage, he added that there is a contingency determined if a longer gear proves necessary with the larger fan.
it is my hope that as we continue to lean-out the 737 program, we could be in a similar position where we can go even higher than 42 if we chose to,” albaugh said.
with the country-rock band chance mckinney & crosswire blasting away, the event was festooned with blue-and-white balloons, cupcakes with blue or white frosting, green t-shirts embossed with “boeing 737 max” and a sometimes cheesy, scripted cheer-leading effect from employees, the event marked not only a milestone for the 737 but for boeing commercial airplanes.
meanwhile, boeing is processing through weekly orientation days 100-200 every friday for puget sound employment, says tommy wilson, business relationship guru for iam 751 at renton.
renton will be adding 600-700 more jobs in the each of the next two years for the ng production rate increases, wyse says.
jim albaugh, speaking at the annual credit suisse aerospace conference, said the demand is here for a higher rate.
beverly wyse, vp and gm of the 737 program, told the 10,000 renton employees that the rate could climb to 60 per month someday.

boeing may assemble the re-engined 737 max in the same facility as it builds the 737 ng family of aircraft in renton, washington.
line 1, the wider of the two lines, would likely play host to line 3 for the 737 max.
all this means more jobs for renton and puget sound (the greater seattle area).
boeing may assemble the re-engined 737 max in the same facility as it builds the 737 ng family of aircraft in renton, washington.
full design definition of the 737re isn’t expected until next month, we are told.
beverly wyse, 737 programme vice-president and general manager, said a potential third line for the max would be placed in renton with the two existing lines by relocating engine, empennage and line work staging areas positioned between line 1 and a mezzanine that runs the length of the building.
a solution may be to further increase efficiency of the facility.
