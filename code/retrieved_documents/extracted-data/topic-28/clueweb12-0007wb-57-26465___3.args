i would think that any problems that do come up would be due to economic or political instability in the suppliers host country.
boeing has as many (or more) suppliers as airbus does - but no co-equal prime contractor as airbus had.

boeing admitted today, 1/25/07, that the 787 might be delayed because of problems with the inflight wireless entertainment system.
both boeing and airbus are using virtual construction software from the dassault systems of france.
the software will "design" a door
so far i think only the 787 uses this method but boeing has hired dassault for all of its next generation of airframes.
thus the extensive rewiring that was called for in the a380.
2007 american bloggers about germany posted by editors in german politics on friday, january 19.
my understanding is that the german airbus design team and german politicians with board seats on airbus and eads are adamant that dassault's software not be used except in france.
the suppliers will not design but rather construct.
added without dassault's software and now 5 times heavier than planned and unreliable to boot.
" endnote: all about germany has a personal take on "american vs german business culture" (apparently the author is neither american nor german, but she studied in germany and describes herself as a "nomad.")
as an aside i would like to point out that i do not wish airbus ill will.

the problem with airbus was just as i stated.
i agree that boeing's reliance on a multitude of suppliers could cause design and construction problems.
then these schematics are constructed at boeing and its various suppliers using the plans that the software vetted.
but boeing is using this software solely on its current and future airframes while airbus has been forced to make do with the french design team using dassault and the german team using siemens and sap.
at least i hope to not read about any wing problems in the future.
the "innovation deficit in germany" reminded me of the difficulties that airbus is having with the a380.
the result being delays and cost overruns from incompatible design work.
a very late update if anybody is still reaidng this thread.
comments () pat patterson - #3 - 2007-01-22 23:28 - ( reply) that may keep them out of a380 hell.
bulkheads, wiring,etc., even whether the installer can reach into smaller places and attach the door on to the proper tolerances.
we are available for interviews, and appreciate feedback and suggestions.
boeing can only remain competitive if it has a strong rivalry with airbus.
but then it will install the door on a virtual airframe that will show if there are any problems, ie.
the way i understand it is that boeing used the dassault software to design and then construct all the plane and then put the various pieces out to bid or assignment.
