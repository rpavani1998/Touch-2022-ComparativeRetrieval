if they had of kept ua’s current livery it would have signaled to everyone, consumer and employee alike, that this was business as usual…just another takeover like any other.it is the most generic, dull and thoughtless compromise imaginable and just shows that this deal was done simply because of the usual misguided idea the bigger is better, which it rarely is.too bad for you the fact is united was financially stronger than co at the time of the merger, and co was the one who analysts were saying was not strong enough to survive in the long term.i have flown on both airlines both domestic and international and i can truly say, the united flights were some of the most miserable experiences a very frequent flier has ever been forced to endure.better fleet, better technology, better looking fas (that didn’t pose for the tail of alaska…or frontier), and they did it without liquidating pensions and laying off nearly 18% of their pilots.it has been picked by the employees and will be honored and remembered on a new united retro jet.the new united marketing people know that the current livery is connected to and reflects that winning attitude and service.a supremely confident and aggresively competitive airline as born out by it’s many recent route announcements, including immediately countering aa’s lax – pvg (shanghai) expansion.i think this new livery is simple, clean and classy.a ceo named gordon bethune came along and gave the airline to the employees who took it from “worst to first” where it remains today.something tells me this merger will be clumsy and poorly unified and branded.the new airline would be called continental & be based in houston.i think it looks good, but i do think they could have come up with something a bit more original than just adding united to the continental livery.it’s going to be all coach-class, code-shared with skywest, and seat-belts for sale.changing it sends a very powerful and unmistakable message that this united is ‘new’.
