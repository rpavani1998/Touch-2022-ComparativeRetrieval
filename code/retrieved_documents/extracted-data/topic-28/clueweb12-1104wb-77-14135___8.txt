airbus provided an a330/a340 market update during its innovation days presentations in hamburg earlier in may.
boeing continues to dominate the headlines with its troubled 787 program, so we’ll look at the us aerospace company first.
this  will further aid the cash flow shortfalls from the a380 program.

delta air lines may cancel the 787 ordered by northwest airlines now that  nwa is a subsidiary of delta.
the global financial market meltdown last year hopes for recovery this year but the global economy is questionable.
this has the makings for being a year of recovery in new airplane programs.

this won’t work–it takes about two years to do so, according to boeing.
our own checks suggest that a new development and testing timeline for the critical software systems is aimed for a sooner-than-later second quarter first flight (the old timeline suggested a june-august timeline for first flight).

the 787 program needs little review here; its issues are well  known.
what is important to emphasize here is that this date is an internal  timeline and boeing is only saying first flight will be in the second quarter.
the a340 has become irrelevant to the new airplane market, with only a handful of new orders remaining and virtually none forthcoming in the last several years.
along with maintenance procedure changes to the a330, the a340 increases the interval on the a check to 800 flight hours from the current 600; c check intervals go from 18 months to 21-24 months; intermediate checks increased from five years at eis to the current six years and remains unchanged; and structural checks increase from 10 years to 12 years.
car’s first conference brought together nearly every appraisal  company then in existence in the us to compare and discuss appraisals of what  was called enhanced equipment trust certificates (eetcs) and appraisals  published by the firms.
the details may be found in thisap  story.
this means it could take place on june 30 and still meet the publicly stated goal.
airbus is tweaking the a340 with some aerodymic improvements designed to reduce fuel burn by 1%.
not likely, either,  because the 777 has a four year backlog and is being produced at the rate of  seven a month, its highest ever.
a blogger suggested that the 777 could be the answer.
one suggestion was upping the production of the 767, currently at one a  month.

boeing and the airlines will have to cope as best they can.
the question is when the first flight and flight testing will begin.
these are just a few of the issues facing airbus and boeing this year.
these are obviously critical milestones in the recovery of the 787 program and boeing’s operations.
here’s the backlog chart for boeing.

the production rates are: 737: ~30/mo
nwa ordered 18, but delta’s ceo richard anderson is unhappy with the delays and performance issues (the 787 is overweight and has a shorter range than originally advertised, though the extent of the latter is in dispute).
boeing is looking for 777s, 767s and even airbus a330s and a340s with little luck.
our checks also report, however, that april 20 is thought to  be aggressive and our sources are unsure this date can be met.

5 comments update, january 10: bloomberg news reports eads says it will be three years after the  a400m’s first test flight–which remains unscheduled–before  airbus will ship the airplane to customers.
that was hardly the point;  because of delays and cash flow shortfalls in the a380 program, airbus really  had little choice.
the used airplane market is very tight.

boeing is looking for 777s, 767s  and even airbus a330s and a340s with little luck.
anderson likes the 777lr and it’s  possible there could be a deal for more 777lrs to replace the 787-8s ordered by  nwa.
a cancellation will be nothing but a minor embarrassment for boeing—with 900 orders, losing 18 won’t matter much and it’s possible others will come forward to grab these in any event.
airbus’ a350  does, too.

a couple of take-aways: this better performance, despite the worries over the dollar-euro exchange  rate, slower-than-desired progress in power8 cost-cutting and new issues with  a380 production, may make it more difficult to get cuts from the already  recalcitrant labor unions; and the a320 family, where higher production rates have kicked in (and going  higher still) has proved to be a key to the airbus recovery and cash flow.
