a visitor from netherlands posted fri february 10, 2006: this is a definition of an intense moment.
i never saw something like that before,and if you think about hard position from what this picture is made, you must say that it is really impresive.
the corridor passes over the runways allowing for shots like this.
this was shot with a very long lens  from out over the ocean -- probably close to 1.5 to 2 miles from the lift off  point.

the best shots taken looking out from the window or cockpit.
great shot - scarily close from the photographer's point of view though?
any doubt this plane is fully loaded with passengers and fuel?
how  did you take this excellent photo?.
amazing shot.but why is it possible to come this close to a 744 on take off,scary indeed.
a visitor from germany posted wed december 13, 2006:
the 747 is an beautiful beast on its own but this!...
consider what you are really seeing in the background.
it'll be a long time coming before anyone tops this one.
it looks like it´s climbing vertical, only  the signs on the runway tells you the right angle.

a visitor from egypt posted tue october 20, 2009: i've calculated the angle of climbing of the 747, by assuming that the crossed taxiways are perpendicular to the runway, so the deformation of the picture is 3.1:4.3 so sin(-1) gives 45 degree !!!
my hat's off to  you!

one of the best photos of all times a visitor from united states posted mon april 14, 2008: how did you take this?
the subject itself (i think the 747 is an awesome sight), the graceful curve of the wings.
it is the coolest view.
imagine how smaller it would look if it was farther than you,  on the runway.
i'm no expert on photography so this makes me wonder, "how in the world...?
