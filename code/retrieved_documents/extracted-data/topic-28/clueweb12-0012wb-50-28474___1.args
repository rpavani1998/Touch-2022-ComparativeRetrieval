the a350 features composite wings, rear fuselage and fuselage skin (with aluminium ribs), new engines, new landing gear and many new systems compared to the a330.
the proposed new a350 was to become more of a competitor to the larger boeing 777 as well as the boeing 787, with a larger fuselage cross-section able to accommodate 9 passengers per row in economy class.
qatar airways announced that it will use rolls royce engines on its aircraft.
it builds on the technologies developed for a380 and has a similar cockpit layout.
on december 1 2006 the eads board agreed the industrial launch of the sixth iteration a350 with costs mainly borne out of cash-flow.
the a350-800 will seat 270 passengers in a 3-class cabin and has a range of 8,300 nm (15,400 km).
rolls-royce has agreed with airbus to supply a new variant of the trent engine for the a350 xwb, currently called the trent xwb, which will have a static thrust of 75000-95000 lbf.
the a350 will have a fuselage cross-section wider than the original a350 which used the existing airbus widebody standard.
on june 14 2006, singapore airlines announced it had selected the 787 over the a350, ordering 20 787-9s.
the a350-900 is the first to enter service in 2013 and seats 314 passengers in a 3-class cabin.
all a350 xwb passenger models will have a range of at least 8,000 nautical miles.
for the engines airbus has confirmed that they will retain a full bleed air system on their engines, rather than the bleedless configuration used on the 787.
airbus also claims that the a350-900 will have fuel consumption per seat 7% lower than the boeing 787-9.
the last to enter service will be the a350-1000 in 2015.
the aircraft will have a cruising speed of approximately mach 0.85, similar to the boeing 787 or boeing 747, and airbus claims that its maintenance costs will be 10% lower than for the 787.
udvar-hazy called on airbus to bring a clean-sheet design to the table, or risk losing most of the market to boeing.
a new wing, engines and a horizontal stabilizer were to be coupled with new composite materials and production methods applied to the fuselage to make the a350 an almost all-new aircraft.
the a350 fuselage will have a constant cross-section from door 1 to door 4, unlike previous airbus aircraft.
on december 10 2004 the boards of eads and bae systems, then the shareholders of airbus, gave airbus an "authorisation to offer (ato)", and formally named it the a350.

in june, 2007 airbus' john leahy has indicated that the genx engine will not feature on the a350, claiming that airbus wants ge to offer a more efficient version for the new airbus airliner.
udvar-hazy called on airbus to bring a clean-sheet design to the table, or risk losing most of the market to boeing.
the a350 will have a common cockpit with the airbus a380.
its ceo, chew choon seng, said in a statement, that "it is heartening that airbus has listened to customer airlines and has come up with a totally new design for the a350."
ge has stated it will not offer the gp7000 on the aircraft, and that previous contracts for the genx on the original a350 did not apply to the xwb.

52% of the aircraft will be made out of composites, 20% al/al-li, 14% titanium, 7% steel and 7% the balance.
the a330 and previous iterations of the a350 would only be able to accommodate 8 passengers per row in normal configurations.
the a350 is to have large windows and will be pressurised to 6,000 feet or lower with a cabin air humidity of at least 20%.
qatar airways announced that it will use rolls royce engines on its aircraft.
the a350 will have a fuselage cross-section wider than the original a350 which used the existing airbus widebody standard.
when boeing announced their 787 dreamliner project, they claimed the lower operating costs of this airplane would make it a serious threat to airbus' a330.
rolls royce is the only engine supplier to date to announce that its engines will feature on the a350 xwb.
this differs slightly from the 787 design which uses ovoid skin barrels on titanium ribs.
this compares to the 787, which consists of 50% composites, 20% aluminium, 15% titanium, 10% steel and 5% the balance.
the a350-800 will seat 270 passengers in a 3-class cabin and has a range of 8,300 nm (15,400 km).
the airlines pushed airbus to provide a competitor, as boeing had committed the 787 to have 20% lower fuel consumption than the a330.

the original version of the a350 superficially resembled the a330 due to its common fuselage assembly.
airbus also claims that the a350-900 will have fuel consumption per seat 7% lower than the boeing 787-9.
chew stated, "having gone to the trouble of designing a new wing, tail, cockpit" and adding advanced new materials, airbus "should have gone the whole hog and designed a new fuselage."
although airbus previously suggested boeing's use of composite materials for the 787 fuselage was premature, and that the a350's would be made from aluminium-lithium, the a350xwb is to have a composite main fuselage skin on an al/al-li frame.
during 2007 paris air show, in a major boost for the program, airbus has won firm orders for 141 a350 xwb.
airbus had signed a firm contract with bmw to have them develop an interior concept for the original a350.
at a press conference december 4 2006 a few new technical details of the a350xwb design were revealed, but no new customers were identified and john leahy indicated existing a350 contracts were under re-negotiation due to increases in prices compared to the original a350s contracted.
under this plan, the a350 would have modified wings and new engines while sharing the same fuselage cross-section as its predecessor.
the aircraft will have a cruising speed of approximately mach 0.85, similar to the boeing 787 or boeing 747, and airbus claims that its maintenance costs will be 10% lower than for the 787.

the 787 can accommodate 8 or 9 passengers per row, while the 777 can accommodate 9 passengers per row or, rarely, 10.
airbus refers to this as "xwb" or "xtra wide body" and states that from the point of view of a seated passenger, the cabin is 5 inches wider at eye level than the competing boeing 787.

however, boeing argues that the a350-900 should not be compared to the 787-9 as it is considerably larger.
