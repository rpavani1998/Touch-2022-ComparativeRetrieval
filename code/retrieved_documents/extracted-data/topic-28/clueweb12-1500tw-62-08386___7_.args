luckely airlines have smart, skilled engineers and fleet managers too, and lawyers.boeing now has experience with designing, building, installing, and fielding composet wings and airplanes, via the b-787.as long as there are no guarantees from snecma for their engine on the 737max, there are no real contracts for that airplane, only commitments subject to performance guarantees from boeing and snecma!they should take advantage of that painful learning process if it is at all possible with the b-737max, and b-777x, the next two major boeing developement programs.that will be an interesting concept, as some ‘experts’ say composets don’t scale down very well and on a scale, like the b-737, doesn’t reduce that much weight.boeing is under no oblagation to keep you updated on the developement of any of its products, just as eads is under no obligation to keep me informed of their products (but i wish john would stoip calling asking me for advice, lol).with an airframe older than the a320 (and with less groung clearance), boeing will have to catch all 0.001′s to compete.in stark contrast, airbus has firm commitments for 1,200+ a320neos, be- cause both the p&w and the ge engines on that airplane have defined performance guarantees on the a320neo.i am sure boeing is also doing a lot of computer testing to refine the configueration before the wind tunnel tests are accomplished.we now know the leap-1b engine will have a 68.4″ fan, but if boeing has to make other changes to the airframe to fit a 71″ or 72″ fan gtf on the b-737, then cfm might just as well let the leap-1b grow a little.it is his job to push airbus and talk down boeing.just like boeing, airbus doesn’t want to come out with the second best product.i am confident boeing will meet, or exceed its goal for the max in comparison to the ng.if we define “team” as two people, and “study” as billed at least one hour to in the calendar year, i wouldn’t be surprised to learn that boeing is studying a dc-3/c-47neo, restarting the sst project, running off a few hundred more stearman model 75s for the collector market, etc.if the engines share the same leap core technology the fan is the difference.
