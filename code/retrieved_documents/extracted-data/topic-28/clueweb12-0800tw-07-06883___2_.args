each company does their best to lay out a cockpit to please the end user â€“ the pilot.generally speaking, boeing takes pilot input into account when designing the pointy-end of their airplanes.an item, which an engineer may spend only a day or two thinking about, can have a lasting impact on the pilots that fly the airplane for thousands of hours.(video) by kent wien (rss feed) on mar 8th 2012 at 8:00am powerful engines providing stellar performance and short field capabilities are just some of the features that set the boeing 757 apart from the rest.as we taxi out, we could also miss a flight attendant call when the latest atis information is delivered or we get our load closeout information, which includes the number of people on board, the weight of the airplane and our stabilizer trim setting.that is: dim and dimmer depending on the airplane and configuration, there are between 32 and 34 different dimming switches and knobs to change the lighting intensity on the 757 and 767 cockpit lights.as a retired ual captain forced out of a great career at age 60 with 22000+ hours including 57s and 67s, i am a little appalled at your annoying comments that seem to be more important to you than feeling very lucky to be in a position to fly such great aircraft, period.when air traffic control needs to get a hold of us, they have the option of sending a selcal (selective calling) ding that alerts us.9:03pm i love being on 757s and love the way they climb but for us passengers the 757 is pretty uncomfortable (and the overheads, well, suck).on my left was an engineer who was the liaison for boeing to the faa as they made changes to the cockpit flight computer known as the fmc and to my right was an engineer who did the actual programing of any new features in the box.as we request the flight plan data to be uploaded to the airplane, dings come in rapidly (i've lost count at eight dings in less than a minute) for these items and more: forecasted winds at altitude uplink route uplink takeoff performance data uplinkhis partner jumped in, describing the studies boeing had done that indicated that humans could only differentiate between five different sounds in a cockpit.unfortunately, some earlier airplanes didn't have that eicas notification feature, so we only have the overhead to differentiate the sounds.to be fair, these airplanes were designed in the late '70s and went into service in the '80s.the idea was that an air traffic controller could send us a text message that would tell us to climb, descend, turn or change our speed.
