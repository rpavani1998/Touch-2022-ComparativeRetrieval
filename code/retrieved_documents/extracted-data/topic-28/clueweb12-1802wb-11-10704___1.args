after this 500hours i will have to do a proficiency check in a jar fcl simulator and then i will get the atpl license.
there are several instructors training but walt runs the whole thing, which is nice.
i feel that i've learned a lot of great techniques for operating a b757/767 from the great instructors and check airmen provided for me, and i would highly recommend that you get your type rating from aat global.
it is a great idea to be able to tailor make your course to work for any operator, however, everyone needs to be on the same page, instructors and students.
you can give this email address flyboy@aon.at to your prospective customers and i am willing to answer their questions anytime.
walt lazaruk, owner of aat global inc was extremely flexible in providing a course tailored to my time constraints.
the simulator was very good and enjoyed all of the training.
the computer based ground school was very informative tool to learning and the best part about it was that it helps you learn at you own pace.
the price was exactly to the cent that was quoted.
now to make my day, on the roll out, he gave me an engine fire on the ground which was straight forward and that was followed by evacuation.
i did very well on my training in the simulator.
ontario dear mr. lazurk, my experience on taking the type rating boeing 767/757 type rating course at aat global.
during my professional career to date i have only worked for 3 companies, kenn borek air, cargojet (for 3 months - ground school only no flight training) and air canada jazz.
then 2 elacs failing so you're in alternate law, then i was asked to do a 45 degree bank without fd's or auto thrust.
both tariq and i would liked to have done better in calgary than vancouver, but it just didn't work that way.
prior to the course we were told that we would be using viva sop's, we were also given a set of school sop's and there are also the boeing sop's in the manuals.
the contract is written is favour of both parties.
air 2 days ago and received my license today with the endorsement.
the simulator was good experience with detail initial briefing and de-briefings.
in order to get a a320 type rating, i had the required training with aat global.
thanks again walt for all your effort and help and send my regards to len and wish me luck.
if you are looking for the most efficient and cost effective program then this is for you, but then again you can go to other organizations and pay two or three times more for the same program which may end up being less in the end.
jafar from lebonon states the following opinion regarding my type rating qualification with aat global facility i think that the course was quite informative and very resourceful.
jafar from lebonon states the following opinion regarding my type rating qualification with aat global facility i think that the course was quite informative and very resourceful.
walt and i want to thank you so very much for all your help and support that you showed me and the rest of us during our course at aat global.
i'm gonna send an e-mail to fabien, claude, and sameer and let them know as well.
whereas, i was surprised to find no instructor lead technical ground school at active, however, cbt's are supposed to negate the need for instructor lead classrooms, and in no way affects my opinion of the course'just an observation.
the reality, however, is that during this portion of the training, the demand on the understanding of the auto flight system and be able to have a working knowledge of electrics, hydraulics, the fuel system and all the other systems found on the flight deck.
you need to be master in programming the mcdu and doing it fast as you will do that every single time you get reset back at the threshold of the runway for another take off in the sim.
oh another thing he gave me was dual hyd g and b sys failure which is an emergency situation although it was mostly stuff done by my pnf except for the landing gear manual extension and slat and flap jamming which i order him to do depending on the ecam call that he gave me.
they will place me only on the domestic flights and then as i progress they'll let me fly some international routes.
we only cancelled one session and that was due to heavy thunderstorm activities outside that introduced power surges to the system.
prior to starting the course, i was able to download a copy of the boeing 767 cbt from the internet and thoroughly worked through it before starting the active course.
now that was really tough.
specifically scott and tim were an immense help.
to my opinion he gives a true meaning to the word professionalism m.
and the cheapest way to learn it is using the free play trainer.
type rating is one of the most important steps after obtaining your pilot license from a general aviation school.
walt is the first one to offer this to you.
with the emergency procedures the sequence they have here is a lot different , so i had to do it their way.
on the negative side, cheap looking cockpit posters and a weak type rating ground school with confusion which may very well be resolved on future courses, especially, as we were the first to attempt a course using non-school sop's
prior to the course we were told that we would be using viva sop's, we were also given a set of school sop's and there are also the boeing sop's in the manuals.
after spending $18,000, a set of colour, original cockpit posters might be a nice idea.
my first 3 flights will be from the jump seat as an observer and it will be to (hesh) which is a resort called sharm el sheik in egypt.
its all thanks to a very good instructor ( len) that aat global gave us.
i would say if you don't pass the check ride then it is not because of the school it is because of you did study .i
in the end i bought a set of cockpit posters from aviation world for around $50.
i know the sim is still there as a captain for first air (ian blewett) just did his recurrent on that sim 2 weeks ago.
during my professional career to date i have only worked for 3 companies, kenn borek air, cargojet (for 3 months - ground school only no flight training) and air canada jazz.
in order to get a a320 type rating, i had the required training with aat global.
i will keep you posted as to my progress.
by the way the examiner was very pleased and he told me that your level of training is maybe a guy who has at least 300 hrs on the actual aircraft.
course material ' 7 out of 10 previously, when using cbt software, i had found that the cbt was for use at home prior to commencement of the course and daily review and then used as the basis for a structured taught ground school.
the examiner mr. steve cunningham also proved himself to be very professional and friendly.
i think, in the future, the world's airlines will seek out alternatives to the high cost of aircrew training.
gerald weber kamloops,  british columbia aat global 767 course critique naturally, with any course or training programs their will be a mix of positive and negative opinions depending upon the candidate's background and experience.
the instructors and check airmen are all current air canada captains, or retired from air canada, so they have a wealth of knowledge and experience for you to draw on.
i am sure katz is a great guy.
i want to take the opportunity to thank mr. walt for all the effort he spend on us over and to wish him all the best.
i did a normal t/o without autopilot involvement just to see how i handle the aircraft then a circuit and an ils approach and landing hand flying it all the way.
aat global allowed me to obtain a type rating for the airbus 320 within the precalculated budget and infact less time than foreseen.
i feel that i've learned a lot of great techniques for operating a b757/767 from the great instructors and check airmen provided for me, and i would highly recommend that you get your type rating from aat global.
you may observe with us or one of our associate simulator providers.
i was first confused because i was flying as a pf from the right seat and not the left as we used to do in vancouver.
home study is a great head start but not absolutely essential.
aat global president dear mr. lazaruk, just a short note to let you know i really i appreciate all of your help and assistance with my a-330 transition type i received through aat global.
besides i had to study their sop's which is a lot different than the ones we had even though they all lead to the same result.
during my stay i enjoyed the superb experience of all the instructors and their patience in training.
to my opinion he gives a true meaning to the word professionalism m.
on schedule 'as promised' recommendation: color charts and graphs would be helpful aat global gave a true meaning to the word professionalism capt poughand re: type rating on a dutch license
on the whole, and bearing in mind that not everyone will have the ability to have their own cbt at home, active's cbt was excellent and was offered in a learning conducive environment.
both tariq and i would liked to have done better in calgary than vancouver, but it just didn't work that way.
it is a desktop simulator but is no way near a game like microsoft simulator.
it was condensed  lots of studying, lots of reading but all in all at the end it was very fruitful and rewarding.
but maybe also my english writing is a bit no sensitive.
not to stall it but the recovery in direct law.
believe it or not i had to do some stuff in the ppc ride which i never did in vancouver.
they will place me only on the domestic flights and then as i progress they'll let me fly some international routes.
during my stay i enjoyed the superb experience of all the instructors and their patience in training.
cameo pourghanad 'a320 course comments, from our graduate student- harald summer, from austria' about my critique: i did a lot of research about aat global on the internet and especially on prune quite a number of people on prune did not talk very positive about aat global.
i still have all your 737 books and cockpit diagrams and am reading through them as my heart is really set on getting the 737 rating and hopefully being able to fly one soon.
of course the more knowledge and familiarity you have with the airplane the more you will benefit from the course and instructor.
i don't know what type you are considering to get but a320 is a fully managed airplane that you need to fly via the computers.
the following documents needed from the type rating course: 1.course completion certificate of the trto.
i really worked hard for it and i earned it truly.
i would like to thank you for the course on the 757/767.
i would like to thank you for the course on the 757/767.
i have heard many good things about him from pilots here at viva.
the course is not spoon fed and may not be suitable for students with limited experience or are unable to work self-paced.
ken hoeg denmar i would highly recommend aat global as a tool to prepare yourself for a career in aviation.
its all thanks to a very good instructor ( len) that aat global gave us.
due to the high cost of full motion sims, it is essential that the student prepare him/herself with hour upon hour of home study so that the instructor is not forced to'freeze' the sim to take the time to explain what should have been learned during the ground school segment; maximize your tim in the sim by being fully prepared!!!
dear walt lazaruk, this is the message i received from the dutch authorities and i can confirm to you that what you wrote is correct.
if you walk they will have to slow down and walk with you but if you run they will run with you.
i will keep you posted as to my progress.
amr received a job with memphis airways in egypt because he attained a type rating on the airbus a320 to: aat global inc august 8th, 2004 my training for a boeing 757 & 767 type rating.
ground school over the internet contact us airline jobs available!!
i was treated very well and in a professional manner and enjoyed my training.
i really worked hard for it and i earned it truly.
the course is short and the simulator hours are not what an upgrade with an airline gives you.
once again, i wanted to show my appreciation and would highly recommend aat global to my colleagues in the future for training on the airbus.
in my opinion mainly , the alternate law direct law , stall , recovery , 45 degree bank and structural damage with emergency decent where you extend the landing gear were the toughest exercises.
you have been helpful improving comfort ability with the plane itself and thereby building my confidence.
i think that we started off on a bad note with kaz.
as i told you many times, i was extremely happy with your course and i can recommend aat global to anybody.
with a canadian license, you have to renew your type rating every 2 years, and walt has been very helpful in setting up an instrument renewal for me.
the instructors and check airmen are very helpful and interested in teaching you the proper techniques for flying the aircraft in different situations.
which again comes back down to the money, as every min of your sim time is valuable and trust me you don't want to spend more than a min of your time figuring out how to reprogram the mcdu.
in retrospect, if scott is running the 767 side of the course then, day 1, it would be useful to have a sit down with the students to explain how the course will run.
the whole work environment at aat global and with mr. walt lazaruk was very professional and pleasant.
i don't think walt tries or needs to sell this as it sells itself once you use it.
for me this experienced will always act as a foundation towards building my career.
a320 ' atpl - 7500 hours total with light business jet and medium transport turboprop.
these companies have very thorough ground school and flight training programs and are the basis for my comparison.
having never flown anything larger than a dash 8, nor, having any jet experience, 3 sessions with an instructor for the ground school was quite weak for us.
i personally felt at home with the instructor i have known for a short time mr. walt here at aat global made the course very understandable and gave us a wealth of information which he achieved from his past airline experience.
however, i used my good airman ship and made a nice smooth landing and he was very impressed.
thank you again astvaldur draupnisson (with a 'v') iceland p.s. astvaldur received a boeing 757/767 rating with distinction to: aat global inc.
i found the course well organized.
then a normal t/o with an engine out at v1 just like we did then continue with a circuit and an approach then a go around with the failed engine after the ils approach at minima.
all the best harald summer salzburg, austria the following email, is an answer to a request, from a prospective student, asking for information on the program.
the on-line ground school and manuals were also very informative.
a warm welcome was the first impression very clean and bright class rooms good computers and programs all different types of training aids available 24 hour access to the classroom full time support from walt himself and the instructors good lesson plan ( from very easy to very hard) and from (known to unknown) excellent instructor
i have completed an airbus a318/a319/a320/a321 course at aat global inc.
not even an issue, great cbt, and level c or d approved by transport canada.
but ones you know your s.o.ps and you ifr procedures, then i would say it is the right place to come.
with the emergency procedures the sequence they have here is a lot different , so i had to do it their way.
having a laptop with you would help as you can review the systems back in the comfort of your hotel room.
it took a lot of effort (5 hours of computer based training plus extensive studying at night for weeks on end.
then 2 elacs failing so you're in alternate law, then i was asked to do a 45 degree bank without fd's or auto thrust.
i left the suncor oil plant in alberta to come to you for 737 training, wrote the iatra, did the instrument rating, wrote the 2 atpl exams, came up to cambridge bay, got ppcs on the twin-otter, both the king air 100 and 200, just went to tucson, arizona to flight safety and did the learjet training, and now already have 52 hours on the lear.
i would have liked to have more time to prepare for the ground school and the simulator.
the embedded questions help ones learning more enjoyable without losing interest.
of course i did a lot of other stuff like engine vibration above 4.3 for n2 and egpws and tcas , and a lot of other stuff which was a piece of cake.
special thanks to mr. walt for the rich training we had and all the care givenspecial thanks to mr. walt for the rich training we had and all the care given mohamad zein 29/11/2006 dear walt, i would like to thank aat global for the a320 course.
i passed my sim ride in cairo at egypt air 2 days ago and received my license today with the endorsement.
mechanical engineering, masters in aeronautical engineering, atplwarwick obtained a first officers position with air vietnam because he attained the a320 type rating.
on the whole, and bearing in mind that not everyone will have the ability to have their own cbt at home, active's cbt was excellent and was offered in a learning conducive environment.
after providing the $3000 deposit, i was able to pick up the course material and it was very much what i was expecting with regards to the copies of the boeing manuals, however, the photocopied cockpit wall posters were difficult to read
mr.. walt lazaruk went out of his way to ensure top notch tuition and first class instructors were available.
st. pierre, who brings a world of knowledge and experience on the airbus a-330 and a-340 series for which i was very impressed.
i knew that i should use selected speed but then to increase the rate of descent lowering the gear below fl250 and below 250 kts then selecting speed to 270 and then at 10000 retracting the gear but first selecting speed 220.
i had also bought a copy of level-d 767 for flight simulator 2004 and familiarized myself with it.
if there are three guys in your course you will get more time in the sim.
the embedded questions help ones learning more enjoyable without losing interest.
it was for my own good which really made me more self confident when i go on the line.
of course this is only a small aspect of the entire type rating but you must understand it was also the first impression i had.
he is an extremely honest and professional person who delivered on all of his promises and more.
he has everything very organized and is always around when you need something or question.
i'll stay in touch and keep you posted and updated.
we had len for our course, he is a 767 captain with air canada with almost every boeing product in his logbook, and he also flew a320 as a captain with air canada for few years.
if you walk they will have to slow down and walk with you but if you run they will run with you.
i'll stay in touch and keep you posted and updated.
summing up my experience with your course i must say that the negative rumours are wrong.
the instructor was very good.
i can add a foreign (canadian) type rating on my jar fcl with a restriction which be lifted after 500hours on the same type.
the only thing i didn't enjoy was the late simulator sessions.
i would also like to express my sincere gratitude to instructor capt.
now i have 2 licenses with a valid ea32 type rating on both.
walt lazaruk, owner of aat global inc was extremely flexible in providing a course tailored to my time constraints.
the instructors and simulator availabilities were to my full satisfaction.
now i have 2 licenses with a valid ea32 type rating on both.
i would like to thank you walt for all the support and the help you've given me.
the on-line ground school and manuals were also very informative.
to whom it may concern i undersigned antoime medowar wish to extend my gratitude to aat global
you need to be master in programming the mcdu and doing it fast as you will do that every single time you get reset back at the threshold of the runway for another take off in the sim.
that i did very very very well even though i never did it before.
kalboussi seyfullah belgium p.s. seyfullah has been hired by a mainland chinese airline because he has a type rating.
i don't think walt tries or needs to sell this as it sells itself once you use it.
it is a great idea to be able to tailor make your course to work for any operator, however, everyone needs to be on the same page, instructors and students.
the examiners claimed to be impressed with our final rides and assumed that we had experience far beyond that of our resumes.
the instructors mr. steve st. pierre and mr. mike maryowski were extremely knowledgable and patient and had the ability to pass the knowledge on to me in a very professional and friendly manner.
he has everything very organized and is always around when you need something or question.
walt, i really want to apologize for my unprofessional behavior and sarcasm after the 737 training and as mentioned before thank you very much for paving the way in my new career.
you are the first to know by the way.
flight training ' full sim ' 10 out of 10 overall the course offers, strong instructors in tim and scott, great facilities, and an accommodating director/owner.
walt and i want to thank you so very much for all your help and support that you showed me and the rest of us during our course at aat global.
lawrence itani nov 29th, 2006 to whom it may concern being trained at aat global inc i felt being taken care of and received all what i  need and more.

you can give this email address flyboy@aon.at to your prospective customers and i am willing to answer their questions anytime.
my point is, the more you get yourself ready for the course and the more input is from you the more result you will get from the instructor and the course in general.
his knowledge, background and familiarity with airbus products are impressive to say the least and his ability to demonstrate procedures provides the student with an endless stream of information that is easily understood.
before i detail my thoughts; the summary: starting the course i was optimistic and impressed by the setup, however, as the course progressed, i became disappointed and more concerned that there was a lack of training.
i have to start from the accommodation as the hotel was very nice and clean and the price was wonderful.
i am very pleased and happy with my training and hopefully when i get a job i will definitely be back for an upgrade to the a330 and a340.
i already had a copy at home, as did wes, and we used this a great deal for practicing cockpit flows and flight procedures.
i did very well on my training in the simulator.
if there are three guys in your course you will get more time in the sim.
gary scott who is an excellent instructor who i would highly recommend to future candidates.
i had the opportunity to complete my command rating on the a320 aircraft utilizing the facilities provided by aat global, vancouver, canada.
i had 2 instructors, both of them were very experienced airline pilots and very nice
they were ready to help any time day or night.
overall i am happy i completed the type rating successfully.
it took a lot of effort (5 hours of computer based training plus extensive studying at night for weeks on end.
mechanical engineering, masters in aeronautical engineering, atplwarwick obtained a first officers position with air vietnam because he attained the a320 type rating.
my first 3 flights will be from the jump seat as an observer and it will be to (hesh) which is a resort called sharm el sheik in egypt.
once we were in the level c or d simulator, our knowledge and abilities came together with the assistance of some excellent instructor led sessions by both tim and scott.
i am very pleased and happy with my training and hopefully when i get a job i will definitely be back for an upgrade to the a330 and a340.
before i detail my thoughts; the summary: starting the course i was optimistic and impressed by the setup, however, as the course progressed, i became disappointed and more concerned that there was a lack of training.
it is a desktop simulator but is no way near a game like microsoft simulator.
the examiners claimed to be impressed with our final rides and assumed that we had experience far beyond that of our resumes.
if we had simply used the school sop's and had a stronger third instructor then 3 sessions may well have been enough'..
overall i am happy i completed the type rating successfully.
walt, i really want to apologize for my unprofessional behavior and sarcasm after the 737 training and as mentioned before thank you very much for paving the way in my new career.
the internet-course was very helpful and i was surprised how quick i got your package.
thank you again  astvaldur draupnisson (with a 'v') p.s. astvaldur received a boeing 757/767 rating with distinction to: aat global inc.
kenn borek air provides the same style of training, however, due to being 704 ops and a far simpler airplane ' dhc-6, the ground training can be completed in as little as 5 days.
i had 2 instructors, both of them were very experienced airline pilots and very nice guys.
it's well programmed software and allows you to program a whole flight and then fly it.
k.f. toronto, canada p.s. kevin received a boeing 757/767 rating with distinction hi walt, just a quick note to express thanks for going the extra mile with us.
well first the president of aat global played a huge part of the training conducted.
however, you can be pretty sure that both of us will build upon what you taught us, and work really hard to be a good average or better ... should we ever get to flying the real airplane!
i had the opportunity to complete my command rating on the a320 aircraft utilizing the facilities provided by aat global, vancouver, canada.
the instructors were thorough and thing ran without a hitch.
he is calm, thorough, clear, friendly and patient.
with this company based out of (heca) cairo international.
not to stall it but the recovery in direct law.
overall the course was intensive, professional, i personally would think i learned from a professional environment.
4 ' 12 hour days in the cold flight training device for procedure training to get ourselves ready for the simulator.
10 out of 10 having the level-d sim for flight simulator available to students is a great idea.
he is calm, thorough, clear, friendly and patient.
i personally didn't spend anything more than the quoted $15,800.
for those pilots who have yet to be exposed to high performance aircraft and/or the complex systems found in today's modern airliners, aat global provides a well designed ground school program which will guide the student along at his/her own pace.
looking back at the last 5 years, i am very grateful to you for actually getting the ball rolling in my aviation career.
i have one week to study their sop's and aircraft specs.
and i have regular public transport experience in all of the above countries.
after enduring over a hundred hours of ground schooling and 25 hours in a fixed base flight training device, the full motion sim will seem a welcome relief.
then a normal t/o with an engine out at v1 just like we did then continue with a circuit and an approach then a go around with the failed engine after the ils approach at minima.
i left the suncor oil plant in alberta to come to you for 737 training, wrote the iatra, did the instrument rating, wrote the 2 atpl exams, came up to cambridge bay, got ppcs on the twin-otter, both the king air 100 and 200, just went to tucson, arizona to flight safety and did the learjet training, and now already have 52 hours on the lear.
basically you will get out of the course what you put into it.
walt has been very helpful to me in the upkeep of my license.
after going back i would definitely miss the long morning walk in the minuro park.
with a canadian license, you have to renew your type rating every 2 years, and walt has been very helpful in setting up an instrument renewal for me.
then gear down so now you're in direct law and he asks you to order your pnf to select gear and flaps plus to make things easy for you a 25 degree angle of bank ( dirty config ) and stall the damn thing.
on the negative side, cheap looking cockpit posters and a weak type rating ground school with confusion which may very well be resolved on future courses, especially, as we were the first to attempt a course using non-school sop's
it was a great help in understanding how the different systems work before you start the official ground school course.
mohamad zein 29/11/2006 dear walt, i would like to thank aat global for the a320 course.
coming from a turbo prop back ground and not having any jet time, it was a challenge.
you can finish the home study in the matter of a week, but don't base your course commencement on that.
in for the excellent training program i had on the boieng 737-200.
walt has been very helpful to me in the upkeep of my license.
he was really impressed.
this in itself is testament to the level of flight training provided.
i would wish all the success for aat global and i like to do my ppc renewal at aat global thanks a lot for everything first office ziad
a320, 330,340,757,767,737-200 is available in vancouver.
i was very pleased about your quick response about all my questions i had before starting the course.
you can finish the home study in the matter of a week, but don't base your course commencement on that.
i became happier as we came closer to attaining our goal.
i would also like to express my sincere gratitude to instructor capt.
the examiner mr. steve cunningham also proved himself to be very professional and friendly.
k.f. toronto, canada p.s. kevin received a boeing 757/767 rating with distinction hi walt, just a quick note to express thanks for going the extra mile with us.
i also want you to thank len and tell him the good news.
well it is easy for me to say because i passed the check ride but one thing i know i did not get it for free.
we were so used to having lots of emergencies on our hand that on the actual flight test we were all yawning from boredom even with one engine failed and fire on go around.
whereas, i was surprised to find no instructor lead technical ground school at active, however, cbt's are supposed to negate the need for instructor lead classrooms, and in no way affects my opinion of the course'just an observation.
i would wish all the success for aat global and i like to do my ppc renewal at aat global thanks a lot for everything first office ziad
basically you will get out of the course what you put into it.
the instructor for the airbus course is one of the most experienced professionals in the airline industry and aat global is indeed fortunate to have him on staff.
he thought us how to walk before running, he started his lesson plan with the number rule of teaching, known to unknown, familiar to unfamiliar, easy to difficult.
i don't know what type you are considering to get but a320 is a fully managed airplane that you need to fly via the computers.
they or let me say we fly to moscow, paris, madrid, rome,etc.. cool stuff.
august 8th, 2004 dear sir i would like to thank our instructors scott and peter as they were very helpful and very dedicated to our goal in achieving our type rating.
i think that we started off on a bad note with kaz.
and he asks you to order your pnf to select gear and flaps plus to make things easy for you a 25 degree angle of bank ( dirty config ) and stall the damn thing.
i personally felt at home with the instructor i have known for a short time mr. walt here at aat global made the course very understandable  and gave us a wealth of information which he achieved from his past airline experience.
dear walt lazaruk, this is the message i received from the dutch authorities and i can confirm to you that what you wrote is correct.
i had also bought a copy of level-d 767 for flight simulator 2004 and familiarized myself with it.
having never flown anything larger than a dash 8, nor, having any jet experience, 3 sessions with an instructor for the ground school was quite weak for us.
i personally didn't spend anything more than the quoted $15,800.
i just completed the course and i found the boeing 767/757 course to be a very good course
having said that, the course has its levels and steps that has to be down in sequence and each step is prerequisite to the next level, you have to understand that cbt, sim cost lots of money and neither you nor they can afford to push you into the next level of the course while knowing that you are not ready.
i found the course well organized.
cargojet and air canada jazz provide approximately 3 weeks of classroom, instructor led ground school covering systems, sop's and company ops for the b727 and dash 8 respectively.
i cannot say enough positive things about their knowledge, training styles and demeanour making for a very conducive learning environment.
but even better was the 15 day internet training i took before i arrived.
after that i will move right into the right seat with a supervising captain in the jump seat.
therefore, i would like to highlight the type of training that i have received in the past as this is the only basis of comparison for me.
flight training ' full sim ' 10 out of 10 overall the course offers, strong instructors in tim and scott, great facilities, and an accommodating director/owner.
but maybe also my english writing is a bit no sensitive.
kenn borek air provides the same style of training, however, due to being 704 ops and a far simpler airplane ' dhc-6, the ground training can be completed in as little as 5 days.
a320, 330,340,757,767,737-200 is available in vancouver.
i truly believe when it comes to walt nothing is hidden, the first day he sat down with all three of us and read and explained in real english the whole contract, clarified and answered any of our questions along the way.
more from your q2; len (instructor) started teaching us way beyond the standard of the course and as our performance allowed we covered multiple emergencies, wired scenarios, challenging weather environments.
overall the course was intensive, professional, i personally would think i learned from a professional environment.
it was for my own good which really made me more self confident when i go on the line.
which again comes back down to the money, as every min of your sim time is valuable and trust me you don't want to spend more than a min of your time figuring out how to reprogram the mcdu.
oh another thing he gave me was dual hyd g and b sys failure which is an emergency situation although it was mostly stuff done by my pnf except for the landing gear manual extension and slat and flap jamming which i order him to do depending on the ecam call that he gave me.
althoug at times the student may feel as though he/she is overwhelmed, it is clear that the insructor has a vested interest on an individul's progress; the instruction is the polar opposite to the typical flight-training environment where instructors are only mindful of themselves.
cargojet and air canada jazz provide approximately 3 weeks of classroom, instructor led ground school covering systems, sop's and company ops for the b727 and dash 8 respectively.
july 16,2007 hi walt, i just wanted to say that my type rating course at aat global was a great experience.
so remember if you know your procedures, then you will pass.
however with the help of you and your instructors i was able to complete it and was commended by mike dressler on a good job.
of course this is only a small aspect of the entire type rating but you must understand it was also the first impression i had.
walt is the first one to offer this to you.
i already had a copy at home, as did wes, and we used this a great deal for practicing cockpit flows and flight procedures.
besides i had to study their sop's which is a lot different than the ones we had even though they all lead to the same result.
finally after years and years of hard work, training, study, exams, flight tests, medical exams, and license conversions, i did it.
they or let me say we fly to moscow, paris, madrid, rome,etc.. cool stuff.

the 737 plane in the bcit hanger is big advantage as it helps with your cockpit flows and also gives you familiarization with the plane.
10 out of 10 having the level-d sim for flight simulator available to students is a great idea.
summing up my experience with your course i must say that the negative rumours are wrong.
the course can be done from in few weeks to few months, is all depend on your progress.
i knew that i should use selected speed but then to increase the rate of descent lowering the gear below fl250 and below 250 kts then selecting speed to 270 and then at 10000 retracting the gear but first selecting speed 220.
of course i did a lot of other stuff like engine vibration above 4.3 for n2 and egpws and tcas , and a lot of other stuff which was a piece of cake.
the test after the session was an innovative idea to test your threshold knowledge about the systems.
after going back i would definitely miss the long morning walk in the minuro park.
i really i appreciate all of your help and assistance with my a-330 transition type i received through aat global.
with this company based out of (heca) cairo international.
there are several instructors training but walt runs the whole thing, which is nice.
by the way the examiner was very pleased and he told me that your level of training is maybe a guy who has at least 300 hrs on the actual aircraft.
yours in flying, dear walt, my experience with aat global was throughout very positive.
the internet-course was very helpful and i was surprised how quick i got your package.
aat global is an obvious choice, not only for the airline, but also for those individuals looking to get a leg up on the competition.
i became happier as we came closer to attaining our goal.
but even better was the 15 day internet training i took before i arrived.
i would have liked to have more time to prepare for the ground school and the simulator.
the standard is very high when you do the check ride.
here are some just for you to know and tell len about so he can introduce to the future students.
the day wise course plan helps you with the planning process a day ahead.
exactly 6 days earlier then promised.
i cannot say enough positive things about their knowledge, training styles and demeanour making for a very conducive learning environment.
he thought us how to walk before running, he started his lesson plan with the number rule of teaching, known to unknown, familiar to unfamiliar, easy to difficult.
i did very well in my interview today and i will be flying as an f/o starting april 1st
however, i used my good airman ship and made a nice smooth landing and he was very impressed.
not even an issue, great cbt, and level c or d approved by transport canada.
the 737 plane in the bcit hanger is big advantage as it helps with your cockpit flows and also gives you familiarization with the plane.
now to make my day, on the roll out, he gave me an engine fire on the ground which was straight forward and that was followed by evacuation.
i want to take the opportunity to thank mr. walt for all the effort he spend on us over and to wish him all the best.
it is obvious that the instructor wants the student to succeed and he is more than willing to help out when the student feels he/she is falling behind.
the instructors and check airmen are very helpful and interested in teaching you the proper techniques for flying the aircraft in different situations.
he will provide airline specific training at the highest level, far above and beyond the requirements for transport canada.
thanks again walt for all your effort and help and send my regards to len and wish me luck.
the computer based ground school enabled me to pass the final written exam without too many problems.
lawrence itani nov 29th, 2006 to whom it may concernbeing trained at aat global inc i felt being taken care of and received all what i need and more.
in fact, the training will continue to become more and more demanding the further into the course and, when you've completed the flight test you will be amazed at how much you've accomplished.
i had a very good flight instructor and excellent flight training.
he is a loyal and honest person.
the instructors and simulator availabilities were to my full satisfaction.
i was very pleased about your quick response about all my questions i had before starting the course.
i am completely satisfied with the training provided by aat global and in particular with the instruction given .
global was a great experience.
i thought he gave me a very straight forward yet challenging check ride and knows his stuff..!!
the whole work environment at aat global and with mr. walt lazaruk was very professional and pleasant.
after spending $18,000, a set of colour, original cockpit posters might be a nice idea.
i would also like to thank my instructor len who handled me with nothing but professionalism.
you have been helpful improving comfort ability with the plane itself and thereby building my confidence.
i thought he gave me a very straight forward yet challenging check ride and knows his stuff..!!
well first the president of aat global played a huge part of the training conducted.
it would be nice to do the training in the simulator during the day.
in the end i bought a set of cockpit posters from aviation world for around $50.
peter frenzel march 23, 2004 dear mr. lazurk, i would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the all the help and support put forth by you in making me successful for the type rating for the boeing 737.
st. pierre, who brings a world of knowledge and experience on the airbus a-330 and a-340 series for which i was very impressed.
remember that there are extra costs if you 'do' need extra help in the sim or briefing, ..etc but they are not hidden and this issue is well explained in that first day talk and review of the contract with walt.
i can add a foreign (canadian) type rating on my jar fcl with a restriction which be lifted after 500hours on the same type.
we only cancelled one session and that was due to heavy thunderstorm activities outside that introduced power surges to the system.
after that i will move right into the right seat with a supervising captain in the jump seat.
the only thing i didn't enjoy was the late simulator sessions.
he is an extremely honest and professional person who delivered on all of his promises and more.
gary scott who is an excellent instructor who i would highly recommend to future candidates.
the simulator was very good and enjoyed all of the training.
kalboussi seyfullah belgium p.s. seyfullah has been hired by a mainland chinese airline because he has a type rating.
it would be nice to do the training in the simulator during the day.
having a laptop with you would help as you can review the systems back in the comfort of your hotel room.
as for walt, a very nice person, good professionalism.
any other information that you feel beneficial, please pass on.
i was first confused because i was flying as a pf from the right seat and not the left as we used to do in vancouver.
it's well programmed software and allows you to program a whole flight and then fly it.
so if you again know how to operate the a/p(mcp) and the fms,sops.
i'm gonna send an e-mail to fabien, claude, and sameer and let them know as well.
mr lazaruk, walt was very informative and quite confident in inducing his type rating of the b737 rating.
the instructors mr. steve st. pierre and mr. mike maryowski were extremely knowledgable and patient and had the ability to pass the knowledge on to me in a very professional and friendly manner.
in flying the b737-200 plus after what i received, i felt more confident flying this plane, for i really saw and passed through all tlypes of situations that might occur with us on our line operation.
after this 500hours i will have to do a proficiency check in a jar fcl simulator and then i will get the atpl license.
the simulator was good experience with detail initial briefing and de-briefings.
it was a great help in understanding how the different systems work before you start the official ground school course.
course material ' 7 out of 10 previously, when using cbt software, i had found that the cbt was for use at home prior to commencement of the course and daily review and then used as the basis for a structured taught ground school.
aat global allowed me to obtain a type rating for the airbus 320 within the precalculated budget and infact less time than foreseen.
as mr. walt said it is good bussines for him and my self if i get a job some where as a f/o on the b767/757 so help you after all in all, i was very satisfied with the whole course.
i have to start from the accommodation as the hotel was very nice and clean and the price was wonderful.
yours in flying, wes gardner edmonton, alberta dear walt, my experience with aat global was throughout very positive.
i found the computer based training course very helpful.
the course is short and the simulator hours are not what an upgrade with an airline gives you.
having said that, the course has its levels and steps that has to be down in sequence and each step is prerequisite to the next level, you have to understand that cbt, sim cost lots of money and neither you nor they can afford to push you into the next level of the course while knowing that you are not ready.
these companies have very thorough ground school and flight training programs and are the basis for my comparison.
i also appreciate the fact that a this was the first time that active had attempted to use another companies sop's.
in retrospect, if scott is running the 767 side of the course then, day 1, it would be useful to have a sit down with the students to explain how the course will run.
it's a great company with great management and i am really excited.
finally after years and years of hard work, training, study, exams, flight tests, medical exams, and license conversions, i did it.
coming from a turbo prop back ground and not having any jet time, it was a challenge.
i have heard many good things about him from pilots here at viva.
peter frenzel march 23, 2004 dear mr. lazurk, i would like to take this opportunity to thank you for the all the help and support put forth by you in making me successful for the type rating for the boeing 737.
by far the most enjoyable (and demanding) portion of the program was the 20 hours in the full motion simulator.
that was very interesting because as soon as you advance to toga the yaw is incredible and you have to apply full rudder bearing in mind that you are off the autopilot which had disconnected at minima.
amr received a job with memphis airways in egypt because he attained a type rating on the airbus a320 to: aat global inc august 8th, 2004 my training for a boeing 757 & 767 type rating.
your 737 course really helped me with my lear training as well.
i am very happy with my experience at aat global.
the computer based ground school enabled me to pass the final written exam without too many problems.
i found the computer based training course very helpful.
prior to starting the course, i was able to download a copy of the boeing 767 cbt from the internet and thoroughly worked through it before starting the active course.
that i did very very very well even though i never did it before.
the test after the session was an innovative idea to test your threshold knowledge about the systems.
i truly believe when it comes to walt nothing is hidden, the first day he sat down with all three of us and read and explained in real english the whole contract, clarified and answered any of our questions along the way.
my point is, the more you get yourself ready for the course and the more input is from you the more result you will get from the instructor and the course in general.
the course can be done from in few weeks to few months, is all depend on your progress.
so i had to use raw data and rose ils and not arc plus he gave me a 90 degree cross wind at 15 kts and i had to land the damn thing.
i also appreciate the fact that a this was the first time  that active had attempted to use another companies sop's.
we were so used to having lots of emergencies on our hand that on the actual flight test we were all yawning from boredom even with one engine failed and fire on go around.
for me this experienced will always act as a foundation towards building my career.
this is to certify that captain walt lazaruk executive president of aat global inc has given me all the necessary information and procedures to fly the b737-200 in a very short time and in a really professional way.
more from your q2; len (instructor) started teaching us way beyond the standard of the course and as our performance allowed we covered multiple emergencies, wired scenarios, challenging weather environments.
missing from the course was weight and balance instruction.
if we had simply used the school sop's and had a stronger third instructor then 3 sessions may well have been enough'..
again, at times, the student may seem overwhelmed but by the fourth or fifth session, things will begin to take shape.
mr lazaruk, walt was very informative and quite confident in inducing his type rating of the b737 rating.
in my opinion mainly , the alternate law direct law , stall , recovery , 45 degree bank and structural damage with emergency decent where you extend the landing gear were the toughest exercises.
looking back at the last 5 years, i am very grateful to you for actually getting the ball rolling in my aviation career.
however with the help of you and your instructors i was able to complete it and was commended by mike dressler on a good job.
believe it or not i had to do some stuff in the ppc ride which i never did in vancouver.
i know the sim is still there as a captain for first air (ian blewett) just did his recurrent on that sim 2 weeks ago.
therefore, i would like to highlight the type of training that i have received in the past as this is the only basis of comparison for me.
both were willing to go the extra mile to answer any questions we had and offered their personal phone numbers in case we had questions.
once again, i wanted to show my appreciation and would highly recommend aat global to my colleagues in the future for training on the airbus.
once we were in the level c or d simulator, our knowledge and abilities came together with the assistance of some excellent instructor led sessions by both tim and scott.
however, you can be pretty sure that both of us will build upon what you taught us, and work really hard to be a good average or better ... should we ever get to flying the real airplane!
after providing the $3000 deposit, i was able to pick up the course material and it was very much what i was expecting with regards to the copies of the boeing manuals, however, the photocopied cockpit wall posters were difficult to read and i was thinking that they might be temporary until i had made full payment, they were not.
at present i am a training captain on the baej32ep type aircraft for a part 125 operator based in wellington, new zealand.
to whom it may concern i undersigned antoime medowar wish to extend my gratitude to aat global in for the excellent training program i had on the boieng 737-200.
a320 ' atpl - 7500 hours total with light business jet and medium transport turboprop.
i still have all your 737 books and cockpit diagrams and am reading through them as my heart is really set on getting the 737 rating and hopefully being able to fly one soon.
the following documents needed from the type rating course: 1.course completion certificate of the trto.
we had len for our course, he is a 767 captain with air canada with almost every boeing product in his logbook, and he also flew a320 as a captain with air canada for few years.
i was treated very well and in a professional manner and enjoyed my training.
here are some just for you to know and tell len about so he can introduce to the future students.
gerald weber kamloops, british columbia aat global 767 course critique naturally, with any course or training programs their will be a mix of positive and negative opinions depending upon the candidate's background and experience.
all the best harald summer salzburg, austria the following email, is an answer to a request, from a prospective student, asking for information on the program.
and the cheapest way to learn it is using the free play trainer.
as i told you many times, i was extremely happy with your course and i can recommend aat global to anybody.
at present i am a training captain on the baej32ep type aircraft for a part 125 operator based in wellington, new zealand.
i had a very good flight instructor and excellent flight training.
missing from the course was weight and balance instruction.
i have tons to do but hey no complains, after 4 years of hard work this is nothing.
the instructors were thorough and thing ran without a hitch.
i would like to thank you walt for all the support and the help you've given me.
if you aspire to earn a large aircraft endorsement but wish to observe a training session first, we can offer you the observer seat on a full flight airbus or boeing simulator.
it's a great company with great management and i am really excited.
that was very interesting because as soon as you advance to toga the yaw is incredible and you have to apply full rudder bearing in mind that you are off the autopilot which had disconnected at minima.
i really enjoyed dealing with walt.
cameo pourghanad 'a320 course comments, from our graduate student- harald summer, from austria' about my critique: i did a lot of research about aat global on the internet and especially on prune quite a number of people on prune did not talk very positive about aat global.
my total flight time is just over 12,000hrs and i have regular public transport experience in all of the above countries.
it was condensed lots of studying, lots of reading but all in all at the end it was very fruitful and rewarding.
i did a normal t/o without autopilot involvement just to see how i handle the aircraft then a circuit and an ils approach and landing hand flying it all the way.
in flying the b737-200 plus after what i received, i felt more confident flying this plane, for i really saw and passed through all tlypes of situations that might occur with us on our line operation.
anyway thanks again for all your help i really appreciate it.
mr.. walt lazaruk went out of his way to ensure top notch tuition and first class instructors were available.
why did i take my rating here it because mr. walt said that he know people at orient thai
he uses the air canada's simulators.
but i don't think that you just will pass because you have paid for a type rating.
let's say the ink on my license with the new type rating was drying up on the 25th of may.
the course is not spoon fed and may not be suitable for students with limited experience or are unable to work self-paced.
the computer based ground school was very informative tool to learning and the best part about it was that it helps you learn at you own pace.
special thanks to mr. walt for the rich training we had and all the care given
the day wise course plan helps you with the planning process a day ahead.
if you are looking for the most efficient and cost effective program then this is for you, but then again you can go to other organizations and pay two or three times more for the same program which may end up being less in the end.
this is to certify that captain walt lazaruk executive president of aat global inc has given me all the necessary information and procedures to fly the b737-200 in a very short time and in a really professional way.
best of luck to all in aat global.
type rating is one of the most important steps after obtaining your pilot license from a general aviation school.
the cbt is excellent.
let's say the ink on my license with the new type rating was drying up on the 25th of may.
i am completely satisfied with the training provided by aat global and in particular with the instruction given .
anyway thanks again for all your help i really appreciate it.
i have completed an airbus a318/a319/a320/a321 course at aat global inc.  my instructor was captain len harding.
the instructors and check airmen are all current air canada captains, or retired from air canada, so they have a wealth of knowledge and experience for you to draw on.
of course the more knowledge and familiarity you have with the airplane the more you will benefit from the course and instructor.
your 737 course really helped me with my lear training as well.
august 8th, 2004 dear sir i would like to thank our instructors scott and peter as they were very helpful and very dedicated to our goal in achieving our type rating.
i would also like to thank my instructor len who handled me with nothing but professionalism.
both were willing to go the extra mile to answer any questions we had and offered their personal phone numbers in case we had questions.
got the the instructors telephone number and i should just call and ask if i did not understand something.
free play trainer is a great learning tool.
