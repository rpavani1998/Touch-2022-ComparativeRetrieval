for those who don’t deal in this business every day, this will provide a better understanding of how deals are won in aviation.this is the story of the ge powerhouse and how family ties combine to enable ge aviation and cfm international to win deals that might otherwise go to competing engines.we regard this as so much poppycock, because we know customers drive announcements and both airbus and boeing hold announcements for air shows at customer requests.the results surprised even airbus super-salesman john leahy, who said at the company’s closing press briefing that some deals came together unexpectedly during the show.we know the headlines almost universally say boeing had a bad show (which it didn’t) and was trounced by airbus (which it was), but people easily overlook comparing boeing’s performance vs. previous air shows.boeing often announces low numbers at air shows, claiming it doesn’t hold orders for the shows and airbus does.airbus a320neo success far exceeds expectations special to kiro tv airbus ended the primary portion of the paris air show thursday with 700 new, firm orders for the a320neo (new engine option) and a total of 1,029 firm orders and commitments year-to-date.we were also impressed by the laid-back, almost shoulder-shrugging at attitude of airbus ceo thomas enders.on reflection, these impressed us: boeing’s display of technology in the form of the two 747-8s, a 787, a 737-700 with the sky interior; the ever-impressive a380 flying display; the breitling constellation; the bombardier “igloo” pavilion (well, its contents, actually) was way-cool; and of course the impressive number of neo orders.first delivery, of the a319neo, is in 2016.one of the messages top executives have repeatedly said in recent months is that they will not do two new airplane programs, following the challenging and unhappy experiences on the 787 and 747-8 developments.we interviewed him shortly after the press conference summarizing the best airbus air show ever and the historic airasia order, the largest ever in commercial aviation.ba’s poor performance on the 767 tanker program and aggressive kc-46a bid drove us to include a nearly $1bn emd contract over-run in our estimates, which are unchanged.none of what we’re about to tell you is to suggest that the ge/cfm engines are inferior (though, obviously, some might dispute this), because they are superb engines.categories: airbus, boeing tags: 777, a350, airbus, boeing, qatar odds and ends at the paris air show, day 3 june 22, 2011 8 comments odds and ends at the paris air show, day 3 john leahy, coo-customers for airbus, says that after cfm re-jigged the leap engine with a larger fan and the seventh lpt stage, has brought the engine to parity with the pratt & whitney gtf in fuel burn.
