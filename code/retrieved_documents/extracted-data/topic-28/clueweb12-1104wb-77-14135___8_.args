this will further aid the cash flow shortfalls from the a380 program.a couple of take-aways: this better performance, despite the worries over the dollar-euro exchange rate, slower-than-desired progress in power8 cost-cutting and new issues with a380 production, may make it more difficult to get cuts from the already recalcitrant labor unions; and the a320 family, where higher production rates have kicked in (and going higher still) has proved to be a key to the airbus recovery and cash flow.a cancellation will be nothing but a minor embarrassment for boeing—with 900 orders, losing 18 won’t matter much and it’s possible others will come forward to grab these in any event.boeing and the airlines will have to cope as best they can.the global financial market meltdown last year hopes for recovery this year but the global economy is questionable.that was hardly the point; because of delays and cash flow shortfalls in the a380 program, airbus really had little choice.airbus is tweaking the a340 with some aerodymic improvements designed to reduce fuel burn by 1%.along with maintenance procedure changes to the a330, the a340 increases the interval on the a check to 800 flight hours from the current 600; c check intervals go from 18 months to 21-24 months; intermediate checks increased from five years at eis to the current six years and remains unchanged; and structural checks increase from 10 years to 12 years.these are obviously critical milestones in the recovery of the 787 program and boeing’s operations.our own checks suggest that a new development and testing timeline for the critical software systems is aimed for a sooner-than-later second quarter first flight (the old timeline suggested a june-august timeline for first flight).not likely, either, because the 777 has a four year backlog and is being produced at the rate of seven a month, its highest ever.(that boeing is now considering boosting the 737 production seems to demonstrate airbus was right about the market demand, too.)we’ve been involved in the airline business since 1979 and from 1990, when we co-owned commercial aviation report (car), have followed the appraisal business.our checks also report, however, that april 20 is thought to be aggressive and our sources are unsure this date can be met.boeing continues to dominate the headlines with its troubled 787 program, so we’ll look at the us aerospace company first.
