we want computers to deliver guidance, assess progress, and adapt the learning path to results, and we don't want a separate proprietary cbt system for simulations.lots of products are certified and we have had more downloads this year than in any previous year.not just the aviation industry, but also the energy industry, the military, pharmaceutical companies - everyone, really.right now, we are compatible with scorm but our stuff goes further in some areas to meet aviation training needs.jack hyde: self-directed discovery learning takes too long and can reinforce bad habits, so when simulations are used in aviation training, there is usually an instructor with the learner.certified products have the right to display the aicc logo.jack hyde: in 1988, airbus, boeing, and mcdonald-douglas were providing dos-based cbt (computer based training), but the same hardware - graphics cards and the like - could not be used for training programs from different manufacturers.jack hyde: the aicc uses independent laboratories to certify that products and content conform to our specifications.no one complains when that happens in a fifteen-million dollar flight simulator, but people wonder why you need an instructor sitting by every learner in front of a five-thousand dollar workstation.so the three companies, some airlines, and a couple of cbt vendors got together and formed the aicc.non-certified products may only claim they are 'designed to aicc specifications'.when the internet came along, we created a way to manage instruction over the internet.the interview was made by the newsletter "news and views" with jack hyde, chairman aicc cmi (computer managed instruction) subcommittee (www.aicc.org).the point was to make aviation cbt run on a single standardized platform.read the interview with aviation industry cbt (computer based training) commitee's chairman below to gain better understanding.
