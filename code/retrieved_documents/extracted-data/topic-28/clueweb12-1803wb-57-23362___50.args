both know that some who have ordered both current and next generation aircraft aren’t necessarily going to be around to take delivery on those aircraft 5 years from now.
airlines put off buying large quantities of aircraft for quite a long time and now the legacy airlines not only want them, they need them.
most see latam going with oneworld and while i can’t disagree with the arguments, i think that skyteam and/or star alliance might just swoop in with one hell of a package that may be too hard to resist.
the strategy of using airbus for narrow bodies and boeing for wide bodies seems to be a smart one for airlines in that region.
take the bombardier cseries vs airbus a319neo scenario that is unfolding.
that’s the airliner that it really needs to go deep on.
i was certain that we would hear other airlines grumble about being kept out of the loop or shout with joy that they, too, wanted to order the aircraft.
so it doesn’t hurt for aa to talk to airbus.
filed under: airline fleets by ajax 2 comments » ryanair says that it may buy or lease used aircraft to fill its gaps until the comac c919 arrives in 2018 with a 200 seat aircraft.
it has serious impacts from labor groups who cannot agree on what day it is much less on who represents them with the company (this would be the pilots) and it still doesn’t have a combined seniority list with one agreement in place with both the pilots and the flight attendants.
enough so that they could buy them, operate them for a few years and sell them at a profit.
not because airbus invaded the united states (they’ve already done that) but because aa would be regarded as one of boeing’s most solid customers.
third, when you look at who these committments come from, it isn’t game changing.
this, in some ways, smells like boeing trying to maintain the older airliner to use as an replacement for aging military aircraft such as what they’ve done with the 737 in creating the boeing p-8a poseidon (replacement for the venerable p-3).
it’s notable that even that aircraft got a better wing in the form of having raked wingtips a la 767-400er for longer duration, efficient flying.
lufthansa did itself a favor and got rid of bmi and i expect they’ll continue their very conservative mangement of the airline and the subsidiary airlines.
both manufacturers know that their order books are soft.
both know that some who have ordered both current and next generation aircraft aren’t necessarily going to be around to take delivery on those aircraft 5 years from now.
it’s a tall order and a difficult challenge for both manufacturers.
they have a firm handle on the 787-9 development and i think they’ll find it within themselves to repeat that on the 787-10.
and boeing can’t be just a medium to large aircraft builder.
while ryanair says its dead serious about this aircraft, they conveniently do not rule out striking a deal with boeing or airbus on their aircraft and i would point out that china has yet to produce a viable commercial aircraft . . .
filed under: airline news by ajax no comments » airbus has racked up over 780 firm orders for the a320neo since announcing its availability and even i have to say that i’m quite surprised at how fast that happened.
airbus can’t build more even faster to meet the demand on the a320neo even with some airlines orders going away.
if they’re confident they can make a new airliner that is 20%+ better, make the bet and get going on it.
but the airlines makes a strong profit.
it would have been a difficult challenge but it is one that boeing is in position to achieve.
i’m talking about 2002/2003 time periods which were a result of september 11, 2001 attacks that reduced air traffic dramatically and killed the finances of airlines around the world.
bombardier will work its tail off to sell more of the cseries and i think it may even succeed.
the bombardier cseries does fit that whole very nicely and does it in harmony with this announced order.
i admire the gusto in which they present themselves and the entreprenurial spirit with which they approach their brand management with.
right now, boeing can reach to the high 40’s without too much trouble.
had they not had to make that announcement, these new details would seem very much on time.
in addition, i think we may well see a follow on order for the 737max aircraft again in the -800/-900 configurations.
the folly is that ramping up production comes with fairly high costs and the only way to justify those costs is to be able to show that you’ll have an order list that will sustain those high production rates.
somehow, i severely doubt that a boeing led by someone such as alan mulally would have adopted such a strategy.
furthermore, airbus made some big promises for the a320neo
second, airbus landed committments for 500+ aircraft.
at the end of the day, it’s about having a customer and earning money.
offering that you couldn’t figure out how to immediately ramp up production to 40 to 60 aircraft a month is a somewhat lame excuse for backing away.
i wrote a long blog post early yesterday morning about american and the rumoured order it was about to make.
i think its labor force is about to take a beating on wages and benefits and i think the resulting bitterness will last for years.
this is a nice launch for cfm and stands in contrast with order a320neo orders that have listed pratt pw1100g as their choice of engine.
airbus need to work hard getting their current production sold until their aircraft are in place but without depreciating values and without massive discounts to encourage orders.
furthermore, it even gives boeing an “in” with the us airways executive team that it has not had for some time.
however, the airline wasn’t without some trouble: airtran pilots tried real hard to step on their on feet in a seniority deal with southwest airline pilots.
assuming it can take deliveries in 2017, that means the max stays in the fleet for as long as 2037 or longer.
filed under: airline fleets, airline news by ajax no comments » american airlines apparently is playing the ryanair game with both boeing and airbus by using a 250 aircraft orders as both a carrot and a stick.
boeing will be biding its time on improvements to the 777 until it sees more definition of the a350-1000 and it will throw its resources into ramping up 787 production, 787-9 development and 737max development.
if there is one thing boeing knows, it’s that they cannot afford to damage their credibility with airlines further with a late arrival of the 737max.  this is not an all new aircraft with all new materials and airlines will expect it on time or early.
i’ll point out that the a320 aircraft started deliveries in the late 1980’s (1988) and several us airlines such as united own some of the oldest models.
this is the first official mention of a 737 re-engine and i think we’re going to see some gnashing of teeth on the part of some airlines over the idea that a fresh design is likely 10+ years away.
i repeat, boeing really needs to get back into the game.
much like the new and improved a330 that airbus tried to sell many years ago didn’t fly either.
filed under: airline fleets by ajax no comments » various media reports point to boeing leaning heavily towards a “minimum” investment strategy in defining what the new boeing 737 re engine would look like.
some perceive that boeing has been slow to release details and i understand that perception but the truth is that american airlines’ order last summer forced their hand into a premature announcement.
that doesn’t mean that airlines with next generation 737s or airbus a320 series aircraft will be dumping their fleet for new aircraft.
what it doesn’t really have anymore is that 70’s/80’s fleet of aircraft with really inefficient engines a la md-80s and what it does have in that category, it’s getting rid of fast.
tam has 27 a350-900s ordered and i think that order *might* be at risk.
what those airlines have learned is that neither boeing nor airbus has a supply chain that can meet all their needs all of the time and on time.
to the contrary, they are struggling to meet demand based on orderbooks.
if you can build if efficiently at current production rates (in the mid 30’s per month), you can figure out how to build it at a 60+ aircraft rate when that time comes.
the a320neo and 737max aircraft are interim solutions.
neither boeing nor airbus is interested in making such deals anymore and rightfully so.
it may be named united but it is run by continental executives now and those executives have found ways to effectively use the 737 on their routes.
filed under: airline news by ajax 2 comments » richard aboulafia of the teal group has criticized boeing and airbus plans to ramp up production on their single aisle airliners and the man has a strong point.
i realize that aa has been serving markets that might demand a 120 to 130 seat aircraft with higher frequency using smaller jets but it can’t do that forever.
the oldest a320 series aircraft are now due for replacement as well.
they are almost all from existing airbus customers and from customers in areas where airbus and france have heavy influence.
iberia pilots decided to strike because shooting onself in the foot can’t be just an indian thing.
the mitsubishi mrj doesn’t feel quite right for airlines to me and doesn’t offer a growth path into a larger airliner.
a new pylon and strut for engines will be used in the style of the 787 and the rear tail cone will be extended and the area above the elevator thickened to improve aerodynamics.
no comments a number of analysts have noted that the real goal for airbus this next year is to sell production slots that are open for current a320 aircraft up to and including eis for the a320neo aircraft.
the current fleet of airbus a319s are “good enough” and while some of the a320 aircraft are getting older now, they aren’t quite old enought to start planning retirement of until those older 737-500 and 757-200 aircraft are replaced.
hedging is supposed to “smooth” that volatility and it will except that it also causes paper losses which reflect negatively on the airline when it announces its financial performance.
virgin america has horned in on american’s routes, frontier has struggled more and more under republic airways leadership and us airways still doesn’t have pilots or flight attendants integrated onto one seniority list.
i strongly suspect we’ll see a metallic silver used with the current paint scheme over that.
furthermore, i think boeing may be able to offer earlier delivery positions than airbus can.
airbus would struggle with that without making a much larger investment in a new line (such as in the united states.)
delta has a fairly mixed fleet with both boeing and airbus products.
i do not think the pilots are going to cede that territory under the current contract or whatever agreement is made for the near future.
the bombardier cseries presents just a touch too much threat in the future.
i firmly believe that boeing was leaning towards a new aircraft but also needed time and space to get where it needed to be with that aircraft.
sub-130 seat routes aren’t going to be long and thin transcontinental routes.
their size (and the size of several competitors) demand manufacturing positions that can’t be serviced exclusively by one manufacturer.
it is thought that boeing will have a slight advantage that, according to many, will remain about 2% better than airbus.
i do expect ryanair to make an order and i do think it will be the 737max.
i would look for a sizeable portion to be 737-900er aircraft with some 737-800s.
airbus managed a coup by forcing boeing’s hand and scaring them away from a new design.
india the airline industry in india has imploded and we’re just watching the mushroom cloud of debris settle.
boeing can’t afford to dither around much longer.
the aircraft cannot be polished like its 737 counterparts.
it would have also been more encouraging to see a modification to the nose gear to permit a full on adoption of the cfm leap56 and, possibly, even the addition of a 2nd engine choice (pratt & whitney gtf).
the far east chinese airlines will order more aircraft and i expect we’ll see orders from them for 777s and a380s and possibly some a350s.
so that they could buy them, operate them for a few years and sell them at a profit.
it needs this single aisle market for many reasons and the airlines are dissatisfied with boeing’s tentative approach to what it plans to offers airlines next.
expect virgin atlantic aircraft to start carrying some message against the iag deal for bmi.
all in all, i think it will be a tough year for european airlines.
ryanair got stunning prices for their original massive orders.
fuel costs will continue to be a difficult thing for airlines to manage.
airlines of that size can no longer afford to be an exclusive customer of one manufacturer or another.
electronic bleed air will be added to improve cabin pressurization (which is much like how the a350 will use bleed air)and better means more efficient fuel burn.
the 767-200er is already clearly a candidate for removal and the 767-300 isn’t far behind it.
and a market glut of aircraft can result in depreciating demand for your new generation aircraft because the capital costs for current generation aircraft can become low enough to make sense for airlines to buy and use.
this will be spun many ways but at the end of the day, boeing got bruised and is not the aircraft manufacturer who gets to crow about success today.
the real challenge in this aircraft is ensuring support and with boeing as a consultant, it may well have some help in that arena.
as much as boeing and airbus would like to think so, they don’t.
some airlines do desperately need newer, more economical airliners.
it will fit almost all of the missions the 757 is currently serving (except for trans-atlantic flights) and it will do it with pretty good efficiency compared to what boeing is offering right now.
at the end of the day, it’s about having a customer and earning money.
again, these are 1970’s aircraft and while their amazing performance lent them a lease on life, they’ve become very expensive balanced against other aircraft that can perform 90%+ of the same missions.
iag also managed to get a tentative deal to buy bmi from lufthansa and become the emperor of slots at london heathrow . . .
it would appear that airlines vocalized a desire for a new aircraft and ordered the re-engine like it was the best thing to happen since the concorde.
once the performance of that aircraft is established, i think we’ll see orders from us and european airlines come in large numbers.
southwest has a fairly new, fairly efficient fleet of 737s and it will want to keep buying new aircraft, too.
the a321 will do a better job of fitting aa’s requirements for a boeing 757 replacement compared to the equivalent 737-900er.
southwest will get its deal and boeing needs southwest to stamp approval on the max.
because these changes add more risk to their ability to deliver this aircraft in 2017.
airbus needs to understand that it isn’t going to compete everywhere all of the time.
mcnerney acknowledges that us airways hasn’t bought boeing in a some time and sees aa as a loyal boeing customer as well.
there is maneuvering room left with those fleets.
the merged airline would, upon conclusion, have far more boeing aircraft and far more resources to service and operate boeing aircraft than airbus aircraft.
they appear to be working very hard to make every gain possible against their competitors to bring even more to the table.
it needs the max but the airline also is put into an odd position in that it is likely faced with the following scenario:
the dirty secret about that order is that lion isn’t an airline with significant risk both in operations and financially.
if it does turn out to be a robust engine with good lifecycle costs, it may well be the leader going forward.
even if the legacy and superlegacy airlines get pilots to agree to new scope clauses that permit them to engage regional airlines for that 90 to 130 seat flying, somebody has to buy the aircraft and fly them.
the 737re doesn’t have board approval to offer . . .
because southwest is one hell of a good negotiator and recognizes that they have power in the simple fact that if southwest buys the aircraft, it’s an endorsement that everyone will pay attention to.
diversifying between manufacturers isn’t a bad idea anyway as it makes things just a bit more competitive and the airlines probably gains from that.
these aircraft will be on operational leases and it appears aa didn’t have to put much money down for these firms orders (if any.)
say what you want (like it doesn’t include any us network carriers or boeing customers), they put it up there in 6 months and they did it much like boeing did the 787 orders.
virgin atlantic didn’t die, didn’t find new partners and didn’t extricate itself from the chokehold that singapore airlines has on it.
airlines saw significantly higher fuel prices this year compared to 2010 and it’s true that it’s a hit to profits.
airbus’ introduction of the neo made it much more imperative to deliver more efficiency now rather than a decade later.
the post i composed and just deleted talked about how having a single source for your aircraft wasn’t really practical for an airline of aa’s size and all other superlegacy and legacy airlines operate mixed fleets already as a function of a merger.
sooner or later, ryanair will have to make a move on a next generation 737max or a320neo.
check out what engine is on that aircraft.
the market will become flooded with cheap, relatively new “classic” single aisle airliners with a new single aisle airliner introduction.
i also think that delta will decide its not afraid of southwest and it will decide to give southwest a taste of bullying it hasn’t experienced before.
simply put, delta is replacing exactly what needs replacement and not buying one aircraft more than necessary.
filed under: airline news by ajax no comments » boeing has revealed more details on its definition for the 737max now and one significant revelation is the decision to add 8 inches to the nose gear.
i think it will be a partial fleet replacement with lots of options for incremental change in the fleet.
yes, that begins to look like a new airliner but it puts boeing firmly ahead in the narrow body game.
this won’t be revealed a la one big announcement john leahy style.
this has credence due to the fact that united has about 200 aircraft that are some of the oldest around (these are 757s and 737s mostly from the original united airlines) and those aircraft are likely having a real impact on the bottom line as a result of fuel costs and maintenance.
that leads us to another reason why that class of aircraft is needed.
it’s not just an opportunity for southwest to succeed in atlanta but it is also an opportunity for delta to capture lost customers.
o’leary, not surprisingly offers that anybody buying aircraft right now is nuts given the prices.
the truth is, i think the airbus a320neo does fit ryanair’s needs a bit better these days.
i also think that gaining the latam membership is not nearly as “sure” as they think it is.
the lack of any other orders even getting mentioned as rumours tells us just how fast the aa deal was put together.
there are no more improvements and as fuel climbs, these aircraft become quickly unattractive even when completely paid for.
the sukhoi superjet, on the other hand, has a real chance, i think.
the one thing it hasn’t done is announce major paper losses as a result of fuel hedging.
a full mix of a319/320/321 aircraft with multiple bases or b) a320/a321 aircraft with focused bases i rather doubt that the a319 or the b737-700 will be ordered at all.
if it buys the 737-max, it will need to hold onto those aircraft for about 20 years.
that said, i also think airbus is a bit reactive when it comes to competing.
instead of making any real progress with its labor force, it decided to file bankruptcy but not before having made a historic order for aircraft from both airbus and boeing for the a320 and 737 series aircraft (with both a320, a320neo, 737 and 737max in the mix).
instead, he’ll suggest stripper poles could be installed on ryanair aircraft.
i think delta will continue to make a big pile of money with very little controversy surrounding it except that i think delta will look for and execute a plan to encroach on more legacy and superlegacy airline routes as it has announced its intention to do so from la guardia airport.
china will tout its comac c919 even harder and most of us will try desperately to keep from laughing even harder.
one great example is lion airways order from boeing.
some perceive that boeing has been slow to release details and i understand that perception but the truth is that american airlines’ order last summer forced their hand into a premature announcement.
airlines put off buying large quantities of aircraft for quite a long time and now the legacy airlines not only want them, they need them.
so far, they’re impressed but what they’ve seen of the 737max so far does not.
aircraft manufacturers don’t win over the long term with derivatives and i’ll point out that there have been a total of 9 major derivatives of the 737 with several sub-derivatives of those as aircraft as well.
building a first time, competitive single aisle mainline aircraft requirese a body of experience that china doesn’t have.
however, their arj21 is a non-starter since it is heavy and, you know, no one has really ordered it except chinese airlines who were told to order it.
yes, initial orders are high(ish) but consider this: annual production of the 737 and a320 already exceeds 800 aircraft a year.
milwaukee will become the regional airport it was intended to be instead of a bloody battleground between lcc airlines.
filed under: airline news by ajax 2 comments » over the past 12 months, flyingcolors has doubled its readership and has seen nearly 1000 blog entries reached with enough words written to equal a book with over 1700 pages.
one example is that the 737 already has winglets (aka “sharklets” on the a320).
however, let’s not forget that fuel is a problem for *every* airline.
if aa had a fully modern fleet now, it’s likely it would not have lost money this past quarter.
we’re already seeing it in some airlines such as american airlines who has finally realized that if it dumps its md-80 aircraft, it can not only enjoy double digit improvements in fuel efficiency, it can fly more people as well.
and a market glut of aircraft can result in depreciating demand for your new generation aircraft because the capital costs for current generation aircraft can become low enough to make sense for airlines to buy and use.
initial orders will reflect some pent up demand to replace aircraft but it’s unlikely that the pace will continue in a sustained manner.
a new pylon and strut for engines will be used in the style of the 787 and the rear tail cone will be extended and the area above the elevator thickened to improve aerodynamics.
if aa manages to get a new pilot agreement that allows aa to subcontract its sub 150 seat flying, i’ll be rather shocked.
richard branson actually didn’t make the news very often except to shout, stamp his feet and act insulted that virgin atlantic wasn’t able to do a deal to win bmi.
but i also think that if any slots at jfk, lga, ewr, iad or dca come available for purchase, southwest will bid the cost of a boeing and lose again.
now, aa has also announced that it will spin off american eagle soon and we’ll talk about that in a future post but that only means aa can (and will) access other regional airlines for its sub-100 seat flying.
this was the tough choice engineering wise.
it would require another production line and even more suppliers for airliners that are now fairly obsolete in light of the a320neo and 737max.
while i don’t expect quite the same delay as the 787 saw, it will be a significant delay and it will impact airbus.
in fact, it presently is the only airliner that does.
they’re just not going to give away aircraft anymore and it appears that it will take o’leary a while longer to realize the position he and his airline are in.
filed under: airline news by ajax no comments » last thursday, there were a number of reports (mostly based on a bloomberg report) that said that american airlines was in discussions with airbus to buy 100 a320 class airliners.
it’s clear that major boeing customers want to see something on the table.
in fact, any worry about the 737max is kind of silly.
i do not expect to see another new airline show up and i think we may well see one true lcc depart the picture if things get particularly rough with respect to fuel prices or competition.
it’s a mainliner by any definition and one based on a design that is 20+ years old.
they’ve proven me wrong and i think the results are too good for them to not to continue over the next 12 months.
and legacy and superlegacy airlines will need them too if they don’t get their pilots to agree to revised scope clauses.
this won’t be revealed a la one big announcement john leahy style.
but right now the cfm leap56 offers the same performance with great reliability and reduced risk for the owner.
if it is and if there is an order, it will be a major blow to boeing.
i firmly believe that boeing was leaning towards a new aircraft but also needed time and space to get where it needed to be with that aircraft.
the financial crisis on that continent will make it very hard to earn an honest profit and middle eastern airlines will continue to erode the long haul traffic that european airlines have enjoyed for decades.
this order will be of dramatic benefit for the airline when it comes to saving on fuel.
i think we’ll see capacity restraint for another year and higher air fares than seen in a long, long time.
to be fair, even the 737ng is getting a bit long in the tooth and promising incremental improvements isn’t going to satisfy airlines anymore.
airbus boxed boeing into this aircraft by introducing the a320neo.
furthermore, both airlines have orders for airbus a320neo aircraft already.
but that would require a fleet change that would take years to accomplish and with a320neo delivery positions reaching “unobtanium” levels for the next decade, the 737max probably does offer the best option given their position.
that’s why i honestly believe we’ll see a large order from southwest airlines for the 737max.
you want to satisfy airlines with new aircraft but some of those who buy aircraft are lessors and you don’t want to anger them by depreciating their assets they already hold.
well, for one, the cost to announce this order was tiny compared to a traditional order.
it didn’t need quite as many 737s.
but that would require a fleet change that would take years to accomplish and with a320neo delivery positions reaching “unobtanium” levels for the next decade, the 737max probably does offer the best option given their position.
i don’t always sense that they’re defending the right things in the marketplace but, rather, defending their image against all comers.
it is thought that boeing will have a slight advantage that, according to many, will remain about 2% better than airbus.
i don’t see a real strong suitor for frontier except, perhaps, jetblue but since frontier isn’t based at jfk airport, i do wonder at jetblue interest in an airline like frontier.
airbus’ introduction of the neo made it much more imperative to deliver more efficiency now rather than a decade later.
the md-80’s are departing and rightfully so.
the dirty secret about that order is that lion isn’t an airline with significant risk both in operations and financially.
there is no financial penalty for walking away from this except what aa might not get in preferred positions and pricing.
they are working very, very hard to bring as much advantage as possible to the single aisle wars with airbus.
i don’t think we’ll see much from the other regional airliners being developed.
my greater point is that you don’t win and you don’t grow as a company by playing “keep up” and playing it safe.
despite its efforts, i think we’ll see more schedule slip and it won’t reveal the entire picture as that unfolds.
with the announcement made on the a350-1000 (which would appear to more or less bring that aircraft into competitive range of the 777-300er but not exceed its capability), it’s time for boeing to bet again.
air india gets more money and we wonder why.
it’s possible that the pratt & whitney engine may have more future potential but right now it also has a lot of risk associated with it.
when you have a competitive environment, customers change from time to time.
the capital costs are low compared to current boeing aircraft and the airliner provides close to current boeing efficiencies.
the benefit in fuel savings on this order will take a while to be realized.
furthermore, it even gives boeing an “in” with the us airways executive team that it has not had for some time.
boeing and airbus don’t make that airliner and they don’t plan to make that airliner.
however, i do not think it will be similar in size.
they’ll be the routes they are today and the routes we see developing even now.
moreover, i suspect that they would like to be let in on the discussions about what an airline *wants* in a new single aisle airliner / 737 replacement / 737 re-engine.
boeing will simply add more and more substantiation to their claims as they continue discussions with airlines.
for a tiny bit more in costs, southwest can fly significantly more passengers on routes that are seeing enormous demand.
more likely, airbus wouldn’t roll such an aircraft out until 2030.
on the other hand, it’s notable that fuel hedging contributed significantly to their losses on paper.
embraer has got a nice grip on the regional airliner business but it also has a problem in that, right now, there is no growth path into a larger plane for purchasers.
that said, we aren’t hearing about airbus customers switching to boeing either.
the 737-800 is a good fit as a md-80 replacement but not as a 757 replacement.
boeing has done pretty good until recently although i think the influx of mcdonnel douglas execs hurt them.
look for airlines to “upsize” their aircraft.
it’s an iae v2500, the same that is sold today on the airbus a320 series.
but with the decision made, i also have to credit boeing for appearing to have decided to go all in.
airbus need to work hard getting their current production sold until their aircraft are in place but without depreciating values and without massive discounts to encourage orders.
they had a short extension to their usefulness but you will see these depart rapidly from us based fleets over the next 1 to 3 years.
these are 1970’s design aircraft and with engines of similar caliber.
i suspect that if doug parker is able to re-assure boeing over its existing aa orders, boeing will go neutral or even supportive of such a merger.
neither works for mainline service very well because they’re heavy for the number of passengers they carry and their range just isn’t needed for routes requiring those passenger numbers.
if i were bombardier, i would be knocking on american airlines’ door with a most excellent finance package for its cseries cs100 and cs300.
had they not had to make that announcement, these new details would seem very much on time.
it’s a tall order and a difficult challenge for both manufacturers.
despite all the bravado, what we know is that both aircraft manufacturers pretty much compete evenly in the marketplace.
numbers are perception and boeing knows how well it did when it was running up the 787 numbers in the early days.
the only way to offer early positions is to increase production even more.
if o’leary and company wish to continue to operate a successful ulcc, they’ll be lining up to buy them as well because they do offer the kind of incremental gain in efficiency that is going to make the world’s legacy airlines much more competitive with ulcc’s like ryanair.
the bravado always seems a little distasteful when you consider how airbus got where it was and, at the same time, i’m glad for airbus’ presence because it’s clear that it does motivate boeing to do better.
right now, we’re a long way away from seeing a sales leader in that aircraft category.
american airlines really does need a better fleet going forward and it cannot afford to wait until 2019/2020 to get started.
and there is no airliner being offered that quite gets the airlines there.
and they will get a good deal but gone are the days of getting a deal where you can buy a 737-800 and sell it in 3 years to *make* money on the sale.
in fact, i was a big advocate of fuel hedging not because of the windfall profits it provided many airlines for many years but, rather, because it really did make costs stable.
that means an aircraft that receives enough modifications to handle the heavier cfm leap56 engine with a reduced fan diameter which should make the 737 models roughly equivalent to the airbus a320neo with about 2% cost efficiency advantages over the a320neo.
they’re just not going to give away aircraft anymore and it appears that it will take o’leary a while longer to realize the position he and his airline are in.
they want to extract as much value from those right now as possible because they know that as soon as they do introduce new airliners, those orders will change quickly.
a good example of that last part is delta buying more and more md-90 aircraft.
the orders its racked up so far are fairly paltry and at risk, in my opinion.
one thing is sure, the comac 919 isn’t going to deliver what ryanair needs and certainly not on time.
if this happens, oneworld and american airlines gets kicked in the groin in south america.
their profits are not taking a hit from hedging contracts that “lose” money.
they’re a good customer.
airlines will continue to constrain their capacity and that will show more discipine than i thought they had 3 years ago.
north america: southwest airlines did its deal with airtran and bought itself an atlanta base of operations and some very valuable landing slots at northeastern airports.
erj-140 and crj-200 aircraft are not going to be practical going forward.
make no mistake, this really would be a very big loss for boeing.
all of that said, boeing is in danger of becoming a bit too secretive of its plans.
filed under: airline fleets, airline news by ajax no comments » virgin america has announced a deal with cfm to supply the cfm leap56 engine for its airbus a320neo orders.
us airways has stopped fuel hedging and their financial results show that fuel hedging just may not be necessary anymore.
i actually think that virgin atlantic will have to find an airline alliance to join and if i’m right, i would lay very heavy odds on it being the star alliance.
for most airlines, going deep on the a320neo is the wrong decision.
airlines of that size can no longer afford to be an exclusive customer of one manufacturer or another.
furthermore, airlines need to hedge against their labor costs which will only grow over time.
the 757 is entering into this territory as well.
well, i wouldn’t be surprised if this was both a warning shot over the bow to boeing as well as a serious discussion.
if anything, i think they’ll promote the cseries and i think they’ll encourage embraer to go bigger.
the a318 is a very poor candidate for the neo and the 737-600 really isn’t offered anymore.
i don’t think we’ll hear about any stunning orders from that part of the world, however.
i think it’s possible that virgin america will make money in 2012 and i think it is really possible that we’ll all be pleasantly surprised by that.
if o’leary and company wish to continue to operate a successful ulcc, they’ll be lining up to buy them as well because they do offer the kind of incremental gain in efficiency that is going to make the world’s legacy airlines much more competitive with ulcc’s like ryanair.
the cs100 isn’t the attractive aircraft but its the one that will fly and deliver first.
when the market is flooded with those aircraft, the manufacturers have a much harder time selling customers into their newest and best.
i also think that united and delta will be growing a bit more concerned about aa late in 2012 once they have a picture of what aa’s cost structures are likely to be.
if you’re an airbus customer and you need a single aisle airliner, you’re pretty much going to order the neo.
filed under: airline news by ajax no comments » the competitive spirit that airbus engages in, particularly at air shows, always both impresses me and kind of repulses me.
for 2012, more explosions and more governmental heads will push even deeper into the sand.
they’ve made it out like the a320neo is a no-brainer for development and while it is an incremental improvement, the engineering to deliver is non-trivial.
this is not an all new aircraft with all new materials and airlines will expect it on time or early.
filed under: airline news by ajax no comments » world alliances i’m not sure we’ll see much in this territory for skyteam or star alliance.
if any orders come from the us, it will be years in the making.
the a319 and 737-700 seat roughly 135 or more passengers.
in fact, airlines are being much more prudent in their orders by ordering a few here and a few there to just keep pace with their conservative needs.
perception is as important as facts when it comes to whether or not an airline views your aircraft as leading edge.
jetblue decided to fly more to the caribbean, entrench itself even more at jfk airport and blew it during an october snowstorm (again).
my problem with this is that it simply confirms the airbus a320neo as the right move and offers boeing little advantage over the next 10 to 15 years and possibly puts it at a disadvantage over that time frame since there are fewer areas to incrementally improve performance of that airframe over time.
presently, the smallest aircraft in its fleet will be the 737-800 or a320 at roughly 160 seats.
this might be good for aa, it isn’t good, necessarily for southwest airlines or ryanair.
there is absolutely, positively, no question that boeing needs to get back in the game asap.
airlines need stable oil prices and, frankly, so do the world economies.
southwest will start painting airtran aircraft in its colors and operating even more great deals to more places from atlanta
however, southwest knows that a new single aisle airliner will be available around 2025.
it is universally recognized that while oil prices may one day stabilize, they won’t return to $20/barrel.
fuel price volatility will continue to be a problem.
one thing is sure, the comac 919 isn’t going to deliver what ryanair needs and certainly not on time.
it does mean that we’ll see older aircraft from the 70’s and 80’s going away.
southwest is doing this by buying the 737-800.
airlines want to know what boeing is going to do and waiting very much longer is likely going to result in either more orders for airbus or renegade orders to bombardier and embraer.
but it doesn’t mean md-90s (which use a far better engine).
the manufacturers think the neo and the max will garner enough orders to justify those production rates.
finally, buying blocks of the a320neo and 737max will make an airline look smart.
as if that wasn’t enough, it made a firm deal on a bunch of 737max aircraft and agreed to take on even more 737-800 aircraft for its routes.
o’leary, not surprisingly offers that anybody buying aircraft right now is nuts given the prices.
i think oneworld is going to be smarting through this next year as a function of health problems at founding members american airlines and qantas.
what delta is keeping isn’t nearly as old and inefficient as you think and the aircraft are far less capital expensive than new aircraft are.
so, at best, the max is an interim solution for airines like southwest (and ryanair and others) and you don’t go deep on interim solutions.
their size (and the size of several competitors) demand manufacturing positions that can’t be serviced exclusively by one manufacturer.
south america latam got its approval from brazilian and chilean authorities (barely) and latam will begin consolidating its operations to make more money.
but with the decision made, i also have to credit boeing for appearing to have decided to go all in.
furthermore, both airlines have orders for airbus a320neo aircraft already.
american eagle has crj-700s that are configured from 63 to 65 seats and aa is currently scope clause limited on how many of these aircraft it can fly.
i do not think we’ll see any legacy consolidation despite wishful thinkers for a us airways / aa merger.
right now, it needs the 737-800 and it needs it now rather than later.
so far, they’re impressed but what they’ve seen of the 737max so far does not.
i think we’ll see a largish order from latam and it will be for an airliner to replace aircraft on both the brazilian and chilean side of the airline.
but i would say that we now have reason 998 why boeing should, you know, get with the program.
electronic bleed air will be added to improve cabin pressurization (which is much like how the a350 will use bleed air)and better means more efficient fuel burn.
these are efficient, for their time, but very inefficient when compared to the latest modesl coming off boeing’s line.
this is why you’re seeing fairly strong orders for the neo from existing airbus customers.
first, garuda is hardly a critical boeing network carrier.
airbus coo john leahy has actually come out and called for bombardier to cancel the airplane.
they wield enough buying power to make any aircraft manufacturer sit up and pay attention.
first, it is time to stop behaving like a teenager in this rivalry that exists with boeing.
they are getting closer and i do believe that china will one day manage to succeed.
the truth is, boeing will be happy to sell to o’leary and take his abuse while they do it.
because aa already has a large 737 fleet.
airbus has pitted its a319neo against the cs300 as the better aircraft and i’d like to point something out.
i do think the a321neo will be the 757-ish replacement and i do not think that aa will upsize aircraft to the 737-900er down the line.
jal will take delivery of its 787s and find that they not only work well for jals needs but actually exceed expectations.
fighting off bombardier and embraer just expends money on low return investments.
the truth is, aa is big enough to get preferred pricing and early slots regardless.
until the world economies recover, the best the industry can hope to do is manage its problems and earn a bit of money.
if it were to be a re engine strategy, it would have been far more encouraging to see boeing design a new wing or a modification to the wing to bring additional gains.
embraer gets close but it doesn’t quite get there.
airlines will continue to make large orders for more fuel efficient narrow body aircraft.
it’s westernized, it’s flying and it does feel like its the right size.
instead, we learn at southwest airlines’ earnings call that they were kept in the loop and . . .
the a320neo is something that american needs more than most network airlines.
the financial crisis in europe will reduce some demand on oil but i see no real economic growth in any part of the world that will drive demand either.
well, for the committed airbus customer, going deep on the a320neo isn’t quite as foolish because it is fairly obvious that airbus *won’t* have a replacement for the a320neo as soon as 2025.
airbus execus fight like bulldogs even when someone just happens to walk nearby.
united and delta made money.
if it does succeed, that success will begin in europe as well as for airlines of lesser developed areas such as the middle east, india and the far east.
however, this is a pretty big loss for boeing in the psychological warfare arena of aircraft sales.
if i were a boeing customer, i would imagine that my attitude towards boeing at this point would be quite similar to swa’s ceo gary kelly’s.
the sweet spot its lineup offers will become more attractive to airlines once they see bombardier actually perform in the development and test of this aircraft.
right now, we don’t even know what the 737-re will be called and that’s kind of bad.
but they are going away because they are fuel inefficient and they’re getting old to boot.
because fuel prices did not go up high enough for those fuel hedges to provide benefit.
that said, airbus also just racked up 700+ firm orders for the a320neo and, that, my friends, is very healthy competition.
boeing will simply add more and more substantiation to their claims as they continue discussions with airlines.
that’s a lot of aircraft and it wasn’t that long ago when boeing and airbus could hardly find a buyer for the planes they were producing.
airbus has to get its act together on the a350 and try very, very hard to prevent too much schedule slip.
he even gets to land a traditional boeing customer (garuda international) but at the risk of sounding anti-airbus and pro-boeing, there is a bit more to this story in my opinion.
this is a big win for cfm and its leap56 engine and while the engine is only announced for the 737re, it is almost certain that that engine will be chosen for the a320 family.
in fact, us airways performance is exceptional when balanced against the challenges it has.
it might be time for more airlines to roll with the punches.
now that airlines know what is going to happen with both the airbus a320 series and boeing 737 series aircraft, they can start shopping for that next class of aircraft that permits entry into those smaller markets cost effectively.
it wasn’t irrational for aa to go to airbus.
boeing’s 737-900er has worked well for continental but i don’t think it would work too well for american because of range and payload.
the truth is, it isn’t high fuel prices that are killing airlines.
they’ll also try to flog the a380 as much as possible and may even succeed with small orders in parts of the world it hasn’t penetrated much to date.
filed under: airline fleets by ajax no comments » every airline reporting on its quarterly financial performance last month cited fuel as a major impact to their bottom line.
mcdonnel douglas execs never could decide when to fight so ended up hardly ever fighting.
it will maintain a large fleet of nextgen 737s for the next 10 years or more.
the truth is, i think the airbus a320neo does fit ryanair’s needs a bit better these days.
(although one does wonder if they’re considering enough range / payload for the 787-10 given that airlines clearly enjoy the performance of late model 777-200er/lr aircraft.
american airlines struggled (more) and lost more than a billion dollars (again).
through this order and previous small orders, american airlines will have upguaged their entire fleet and particularly so in the next 5 to 7 years.
europe: british airways managed to get through 2011 without any huge problems and saw willie walsh move up to the ceo position of international airlines group which means willie’s still in charge.
no huge numbers but large enough to make a splash.
let’s look at the details first: the aircraft will begin arriving from both lines in 2013 and american airlines thinks it will have one of the youngest fleets in about 5 years.
i have a feeling that boeing might be aiming higher.
and bombardier is making the aircraft.
i suspect that if doug parker is able to re-assure boeing over its existing aa orders, boeing will go neutral or even supportive of such a merger.
they can make more money for a tiny incremental cost in fuel and one additional flight attendant.
american needs better seat mile costs on its routes and it can achieve those because it can fill its aircraft with business passengers.
the aircraft of choice will be, i think, the airbus a320neo
japan will find ana deploying more and more 787s on more and more routes with more and more success with that aircraft.
they appear to be working very hard to make every gain possible against their competitors to bring even more to the table.
you want to satisfy airlines with new aircraft but some of those who buy aircraft are lessors and you don’t want to anger them by depreciating their assets they already hold.
current demand isn’t from growth, it’s simply from the need to replace aging airliners and the thoughts of ramping up production to 50+ per month does smack of hubris.
a good example of that last part is delta buying more and more md-90 aircraft.
this may well be the “major network carrier” that airbus coo john leahy has spoken of with respect to the a320neo.
in fact, i think it may well end up being the 737max-9 instead of the 737max-8.
filed under: airline news by ajax no comments » 737max is getting real april 11, 2012 on 9:02 pm | in aircraft development | no comments boeing has revealed more details on its definition for the 737max now and one significant revelation is the decision to add 8 inches to the nose gear.
on the one hand, airbus coo john leahy gets to make good on his prediction of 500+ committments to the a320neo by the paris air show.
mcnerney acknowledges that us airways hasn’t bought boeing in a some time and sees aa as a loyal boeing customer as well.
i do wonder how much longer lufthansa can rely upon its a340 aircraft and somewhat expect lufthansa to bite the bullet and buy the 777.
this airline also flies from far less popular hubs, contracts with far less ideal regional airlines and has far fewer international flights and even if it could fly more international routes, it lacks the equipment to do so.
airlines haven’t been able to plan their costs very effectively for the past 3 years.
they are working very, very hard to bring as much advantage as possible to the single aisle wars with airbus.
however, what makes sense for aa doesn’t necessarily make sense for another airline.
boeing/mcdonnel douglas pitted the 717 against the embraer 170/190 and got its hat handed to them.
ryanair will back away from this aircraft quietly, i think.
airlines such as southwest realize that a smaller airliner is probably necessary for growth now that they have the nation’s largest cities essentially covered.
i dislike the bravado and somewhat cheap order tactics as well.
the truth is that the emerging economies are largely dependent upon demand from both europe and north america and neither of those economies will see high growth in 2012.
i think we’ll see an order and i suspect that order may well go all to boeing.
the middle east after ordering an insane amount of widebodies in 2011, emirates will order another insane amount of widebody aircraft and beat up on boeing about its 747-8i.
if there is one thing boeing knows, it’s that they cannot afford to damage their credibility with airlines further with a late arrival of the 737max.
it’s learning curve with new materials and design approaches has peaked.
neither boeing nor airbus is interested in making such deals anymore and rightfully so.
the truth is, boeing will be happy to sell to o’leary and take his abuse while they do it.
we won’t see a need for production rates at 50 or more per month until a manufacturer gets off its duff and builds a new single aisle aircraft.
filed under: airline news by ajax 3 comments » 2011 wasn’t the worst year for airlines and 2012 won’t be either.
this is an airline that 6 years later is still effectively operating as two airlines (under one name).
the airline with the most fuel efficient aircraft will see an advantage.
united will order a nice chunk of aircraft and i’ll bet that it will be an order similar in mix to the american airlines order from both airbus and boeing.
it needs replacement aircraft for the remaining 737-300/500 aircraft in the fleet and that is being achieved with 737-800s (which replace 737-700s which then replace 737-300/500 aircraft.)
one great example is lion airways order from boeing.
some are older than those inefficient 737-300 aircraft and no longer have the fuel efficiency that the latest airbus offerings possess.
boeing plays a bit more fair in this area in that it doesn’t “count” something as a committment until it is a firm order.
this order is about a marginal increase in capacity over time for most routes with the 757s leaving ever so slowly over time.
i think we’ll see alaska airlines find even more odd partners for its success and still manage to cozy up close to delta while doing it.
the merged airline would, upon conclusion, have far more boeing aircraft and far more resources to service and operate boeing aircraft than airbus aircraft.
american airlines is a great example and they’ve made their order.
this only makes sense as the gains are more than enough to justify the purchases and now is the time to gain an advantage in bargaining with both boeing and airbus.
that’s an aircraft that has run its course without something game changing.
the capital costs are low compared to current boeing aircraft and the airliner provides close to current boeing efficiencies.
an airliner series with practical passenger capacities ranging from 90 to 130 seats is just what these airlines need.
airbus can’t build more even faster to meet the demand on the a320neo even with some airlines orders going away.
i think american airlines will plod through its bankruptcy in 2012 with a bit of scandal here and there.
