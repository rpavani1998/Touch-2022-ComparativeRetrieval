the aircraft will have a cruising speed of approximately mach 0.85, similar to the boeing 787 or boeing 747, and airbus claims that its maintenance costs will be 10% lower than for the 787.the a350-800 will seat 270 passengers in a 3-class cabin and has a range of 8,300 nm (15,400 km).when boeing announced their 787 dreamliner project, they claimed the lower operating costs of this airplane would make it a serious threat to airbus'when boeing announced their 787 dreamliner project, they claimed the lower operating costs of this airplane would make it a serious threat to airbus' a330.its ceo, chew choon seng, said in a statement, that "it is heartening that airbus has listened to customer airlines and has come up with a totally new design for the a350."the proposed new a350 was to become more of a competitor to the larger boeing 777 as well as the boeing 787, with a larger fuselage cross-section able to accommodate 9 passengers per row in economy class.the airlines pushed airbus to provide a competitor, as boeing had committed the 787 to have 20% lower fuel consumption than the a330.the a350-900 is the first to enter service in 2013 and seats 314 passengers in a 3-class cabin.the 787 can accommodate 8 or 9 passengers per row, while the 777 can accommodate 9 passengers per row or, rarely, 10.the a330 and previous iterations of the a350 would only be able to accommodate 8 passengers per row in normal configurations.the a350 is to have large windows and will be pressurised to 6,000 feet or lower with a cabin air humidity of at least 20%.52% of the aircraft will be made out of composites, 20% al/al-li, 14% titanium, 7% steel and 7% the balance.on december 10 2004 the boards of eads and bae systems, then the shareholders of airbus, gave airbus an "authorisation to offer (ato)", and formally named it the a350.udvar-hazy called on airbus to bring a clean-sheet design to the table, or risk losing most of the market to boeing.for the engines airbus has confirmed that they will retain a full bleed air system on their engines, rather than the bleedless configuration used on the 787.
