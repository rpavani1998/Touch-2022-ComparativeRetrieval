not to take anything away from airbus' technical abilities, there's no doubt their current success in the marketplace is directly attributable to the continuous flow of subsidies they have received over the years.boeing did it the right way, fair and square as a private company, and has every right to feel good about the success achieved.our shipyards, airplane makers, mom & pop machine shops, textile mill, steel mills are needed to achieve a functioning manufacturing base in this country.the ruling according to business week fell short of saying development loans to airbus constitute a pattern of aid detrimental to boeing and the us worker.we can only hope airbus and their supporting governments will take notice and take a higher ethical road in the future.in addition to protecting these industries we need the profits to stay in the us.airbus doesn't make as good of a plane as what boeing makes, but they sure are an agressive competitor.first class organizations compete on the sound decisions by the leadership and dedication of their employees.the f35 will be made with critical parts made by partners and it will become the operational backbone of the us airforces...i also understand that boeing management has to walk a very fine line to help sustain and grow our business both nationally and internationally.they accomplish nothing but assist in appearance of improprietory and protectionism.on the other hand, airbus' satisfaction is diluted at best, knowing well their illegal governmental support was crucial to their success.now with a wto ruling the us government can take action in a number of ways against airbus/eads and governments involved.government handouts for airbus with minimal or no payback provisions are hardly the same as boeing getting a tax break or winning a competitive military contract.hill (saint louis, mo): i'm certainly no authority in this matter, but it seems as though the us government, in its determination to get the cheapest product possible, would welcome other-government subsidies on an airbus tanker for the us.
