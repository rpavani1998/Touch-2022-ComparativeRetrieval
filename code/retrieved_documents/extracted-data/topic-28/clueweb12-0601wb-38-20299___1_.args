otherwise, crew and passenger deaths will continue to mount as they are doing currently while aircraft and aircraft system bugs slam aircraft into the ground, without regard for human life or culture.somewhere a compromise has to be reached in the new - generation aircraft whereby a pilot, for now at least, knows he/she will have direct, total and undisputable control capability of the aircraft in all phases of flight.it is ironic that, facts notwithstanding, the china crash has many "earmarks" of pilot error, although that is yet to be determined.it is my opinion that no matter what a pilot's culture (the aircraft should not care!), when he/she straps into the seat of any airplane, she/he should not have to worry if he/she is going to fly it or if some competent or otherwise non- pilot software writer's work is going to jump in from time totime to have the airplane make a critical decision.nor do i expect airline pilots to hand - fly their craft at high altitude enroute (while wearing their caps crooked and sweating), because that is neither feasible nor desirable.i am fully aware that many military aircraft have computer control devices that would otherwise make the aircraft unflyable (i.e., by hand) under certain mission flight conditions.i am talking about zero system/autopilot surprises of a lethal nature, and a pilot's having direct control capability.we know the next set of steps, coming too soon perhaps, will bring pilotless aircraft from gate to gate.us airlines post lower earnings in 2011 (ft) china sinopec completes country's first biofuel for aviation (crvw)aircraft designers, manufacturers and computer programmers must not be allowed to usurp this capability for now.aviation's roots firmly planted in state (avia) general dynamics corporation : jet aviation acquires enterprise ...jetstar airlines appoints new director general (dlys) lahood to ask ups, fedex to follow pilot fatigue rule (nwsd) urva: funding to become estonian air's main issue (nwsb)t.d. ponder atp bhm 10,000 hrs.+ pic back to hangar talk note: reviews and opinions do not necessarily represent those of landings, its personnel and employees.royal jet flies the flag (corp) chattanooga airport's new corporate flight center secures leed ...
