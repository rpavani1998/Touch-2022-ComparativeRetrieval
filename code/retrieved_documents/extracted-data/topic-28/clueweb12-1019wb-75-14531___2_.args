oversales of the 737 have been a key element in boeing being able to maintain current production levels of 31/mo, despite the global recession.the agreement also includes purchase rights to acquire up to 58 additional boeing 787 aircraft, with deliveries between 2015 and 2020.boeing wasn’t able to increase passenger shoulder width comfort because the fuselage width is what it is, but there is more headroom space with the redesigned bins and the lighting is much more pleasant.the underlying thesis that washington hasn’t attracted significant new aerospace business is indisputably true and most if not all of the statistical data comparing states-to-states is publicly available.the 737′s aerodynamics were pretty clean to begin with, so getting a 1% airframe gain in fuel burn was probably about as good as could be expected.the deloitte study concluded washington is not competitive with texas, kansas and some other southern states due to its business climate deficiencies, labor issues and other factors.categories: eco-aviation tags: eco-aviation conference a calyon bank official said at the annual airfinance journal conference that airbus and boeing may have to increase funding more than the companies expected this year because the funding gap is larger than thought.our personal observations: the new interior, with 787 features, is a major improvement over those in today’s 737s (and airbus a320s) from a passenger perspective.airbus is hoping for up to 5% fuel burn improvements for the a320 enhancements, but boeing told us some time ago these would only at best match the 737 and not better it (airbus probably would take a different view).the washington state labor council and the national headquarters of the international association of machinists (iam local 751 represents thousands of boeing workers in puget sound) dismissed the veracity of the deloitte study because deloitte has done work for boeing in the past.this illustrates the challenges boeing has in tweaking the 737 without a re-engining before going to an all-new airplane.“over the next 10 years, (boeing commercial airplanes) will move to southern states with weaker unions and right-to-work laws that diminish union power,” aboulafia wrote in a briefing.on the year-end 2008 earnings call in january, ceo jim mcnerney acknowledged that oversales for 2009 had been reduced to about 15% over the production (which mathematically equated to about 55-56 737s).the validity of the wrc study was discounted by a close observer of boeing because wrc officials have previous connections to boeing.as was previously acknowledged by boeing, 2009 737 oversales were about 100.
