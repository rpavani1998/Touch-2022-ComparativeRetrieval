the f35 will be made with critical parts made by partners and it will become the operational backbone of the us airforces...
government handouts for airbus with minimal or no payback provisions are hardly the same as boeing getting a tax break or winning a competitive military contract.
germany and france are providing development aid to airbus now for the a350.
i also understand that boeing management has to walk a very fine line to help sustain and grow our business both nationally and internationally.
well, today you may have seen or heard reports about the wto’s final ruling in the u.s. government’s case against european government subsidies to airbus.
if subsidies are restricted in this competition, then the us government effectively gets less competition.
they use "protectionism" on every product they build.
not to take anything away from airbus' technical abilities, there's no doubt their current success in the marketplace is directly attributable to the continuous flow of subsidies they have received over the years.
the main point i see is what will we, (boeing) do about the a350.
back to commercial aircrafts - the 787: the ultimate load test(wing 150% test load) is in prepartion since february 8.
different to the f22 or f35 projects the tanker project welcomed an us/europe partner team.
boeing did it the right way, fair and square as a private company, and has every right to feel good about the success achieved.
speea for one was internally looking at this for years and ways that were open in the past under the byrd ammendment, to file a counter vailing duties (cvd) case against airbus for example.
posted on march 24, 2010 09:19barun majumdar (seattle, wa, usa): wto ruling is very timely.
we now have 7a7 based configuration, air force can have their pick.
well, today you may have seen or heard reports about the wto’s final ruling in the u.s. government’s case against european government subsidies to airbus.
first class organizations compete on the sound decisions by the leadership and dedication of their employees.
i don't understand the complaints from eads about us protectionism when they say the tanker rfp favors boeing's smaller entry.
now with a wto ruling the us government can take action in a number of ways against airbus/eads and governments involved.
airbus doesn't make as good of a plane as what boeing makes, but they sure are an agressive competitor.
on the other hand, airbus' satisfaction is diluted at best, knowing well their illegal governmental support was crucial to their success.
i know that airbus is a very vicious strong competator and would like to put boeing out of business.
boeing, dem., or rep. knew enough about eads before the company was invited to offer a proposal!!!
i know that the a380 has really bit the heals of the iconic 747.
we will not treat any comments you submit as confidential information.

what is unfair is that airbus can sell planes cheaper than boeing and airline buy them.
however, the news reports we’re seeing quote officials who say that the u.s. has prevailed on all of the major issues in the final decision, reaffirming the wto’s interim decision from last year.
i agree with mr. carter's comments about protecting america's core industries, especially when it comes to our defense.
hill (saint louis, mo): i'm certainly no authority in this matter, but it seems as though the us government, in its determination to get the cheapest product possible, would welcome other-government subsidies on an airbus tanker for the us.
that way, they (we) effectively get other-government buy-in for our next us tanker.
so let us plan to win, not beg for hand-outs.
beside, don't keep our military blindfolded when solicit rfp for the tankers.
airbus claims 530 orders already for it.
unfortunately, it doesn't change anything in regards to all of the existing airplane programs already developed and in production.
what it can do is put what's left of the development of the a350 and any other new programs, on a market based playing field.
we can only hope airbus and their supporting governments will take notice and take a higher ethical road in the future.
they accomplish nothing but assist in appearance of improprietory and protectionism.
that route is no longer available since congress change the rules on who could file.
i hope the company could admit that the company and the the unions raised this issue to elected leaders and got the us government to file the wto case.
the ruling according to business week fell short of saying development loans to airbus constitute a pattern of aid detrimental to boeing and the us worker.
i will note that the article does not mention the unions involvement in this issue.
our shipyards, airplane makers, mom & pop machine shops, textile mill, steel mills are needed to achieve a functioning manufacturing base in this country.
however all comments are moderated and may not post immediately.
we need to take care of our own first...eads does this and makes us out to be the bad guy.

i want to see more boeings being sold, especially the 747-8i's 737's to continue and for triple seven's to continue without the threat of the a350 to bite the heals of the 777.
i think that it is time for a change in the way our politicians do business in this country.

i also remember airbus saying that the 787 was not a viable model back in 2003 when the a380 was the answer, now they are borrowing like crazy to build its competitor with the a350.
i hope that the wto can weaken airbus and that airbus can play by the rules.
but so is the f-22 and the f-35 by the us government but so is every combat and most other military aircraft by the government of the countries they come from.
however, the news reports we’re seeing quote officials who say that the u.s. has prevailed on all of the major issues in the final decision, reaffirming the wto’s interim decision from last year.
in addition to protecting these industries we need the profits to stay in the us.
