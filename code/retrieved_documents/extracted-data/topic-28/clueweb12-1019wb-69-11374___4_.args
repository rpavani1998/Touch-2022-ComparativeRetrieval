despite the efforts, boeing negotiators remain convinced they can force speea members to accept a contract that keeps wages below market, removes pensions for new hires and opens the door to fragmenting bargaining units into smaller and smaller groups of employees.this type of employee polling is not acceptable as part of the collective bargaining process and is affecting our ability to successfully conclude our contract negotiations with the company.it owns and manages a fleet of slight more than 1,000 planes with a value of $55 billion.this improper communications is being used by boeing negotiators to gauge what is an acceptable contract offer for speea members.“it would be unfortunate for customers, shareholders and employees of boeing if we can’t reach a deal at the bargaining table.”before the 767 orders were placed to take care of 787 customer delays, the backlog was about four years at one a month.by mutual agreement, specific details of the responses and counterproposals will not be available until negotiations conclude.but what is more ironic is that boeing’s integrated defense systems denigrated the skills of the alabama workers during the tanker competition, suggesting they might have trouble building a tricycle if northrop got the tanker contract.a simple majority “yes” vote gives the negotiation teams authority to call a strike if necessary.i’d take a look at the assets we have,” said stephen nodine, president of the mobile county commission, whose offices are in mobile, ala. alabama, of course, is the proposed site for the northrop grumman/airbus kc-30 tanker proposed in competition with boeing’s kc-767, which will be assembled in the seattle area if boeing ultimately wins the contract.this is a highly positive development for the airline industry.the action comes after two days of non-productive and discouraging dialog with boeing over key economic issues, including wages, pensions, medical benefits and the company’s ongoing attempts to strip utah engineers from the professional contract.boeing previously booked an order for nine 767s for all nippon airways, a customer affected by delays with the 787.for legal reasons, we are interested in your experience if contacted by management.the current backlog and production rate gives boeing four years to keep the line open.
