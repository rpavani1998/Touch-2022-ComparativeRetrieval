the capital costs are low compared to current boeing aircraft and the airliner provides close to current boeing efficiencies.diversifying between manufacturers isn’t a bad idea anyway as it makes things just a bit more competitive and the airlines probably gains from that.now that airlines know what is going to happen with both the airbus a320 series and boeing 737 series aircraft, they can start shopping for that next class of aircraft that permits entry into those smaller markets cost effectively.the real challenge in this aircraft is ensuring support and with boeing as a consultant, it may well have some help in that arena.this airline also flies from far less popular hubs, contracts with far less ideal regional airlines and has far fewer international flights and even if it could fly more international routes, it lacks the equipment to do so.it will fit almost all of the missions the 757 is currently serving (except for trans-atlantic flights) and it will do it with pretty good efficiency compared to what boeing is offering right now.the financial crisis on that continent will make it very hard to earn an honest profit and middle eastern airlines will continue to erode the long haul traffic that european airlines have enjoyed for decades.the merged airline would, upon conclusion, have far more boeing aircraft and far more resources to service and operate boeing aircraft than airbus aircraft.airlines need stable oil prices and, frankly, so do the world economies.what those airlines have learned is that neither boeing nor airbus has a supply chain that can meet all their needs all of the time and on time.some are older than those inefficient 737-300 aircraft and no longer have the fuel efficiency that the latest airbus offerings possess.my problem with this is that it simply confirms the airbus a320neo as the right move and offers boeing little advantage over the next 10 to 15 years and possibly puts it at a disadvantage over that time frame since there are fewer areas to incrementally improve performance of that airframe over time.this has credence due to the fact that united has about 200 aircraft that are some of the oldest around (these are 757s and 737s mostly from the original united airlines) and those aircraft are likely having a real impact on the bottom line as a result of fuel costs and maintenance.if o’leary and company wish to continue to operate a successful ulcc, they’ll be lining up to buy them as well because they do offer the kind of incremental gain in efficiency that is going to make the world’s legacy airlines much more competitive with ulcc’s like ryanair.for a tiny bit more in costs, southwest can fly significantly more passengers on routes that are seeing enormous demand.
