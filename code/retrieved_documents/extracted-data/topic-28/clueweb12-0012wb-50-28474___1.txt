the a350 features composite wings, rear fuselage and fuselage skin (with  aluminium ribs), new engines, new landing gear and many new systems compared to  the a330.
the proposed new a350 was to become more of a  competitor to the larger boeing 777 as well as the boeing 787, with a larger  fuselage cross-section able to accommodate 9 passengers per row in economy  class.
qatar airways announced that it will use rolls royce engines on its aircraft.
the a350-900  will enter service in 2013.
airbus a350 xwb presentation the airbus a350 is a long-range, mid-sized, widebody family of airliners currently under development, designed to compete with the boeing 777 and boeing 787.it will also compete with airbus' own a330 and a340, since plans to discontinue those models have not been announced.
john leahy refers to the old design as "airbus taper".
airbus initially rejected this claim, stating that the 787 was itself just a reaction to the a330, and that no response was needed to the 787.
late in 2006 a decision on formal launch was delayed as a result of delays  of the airbus a380.
it builds on the technologies developed for a380 and has a similar  cockpit layout.
airbus achieved its first sale of the redesigned a350 four days after its  unveiling when singapore airlines announced an order for 20 a350 xwbs with  options of a further 20.
on december 1 2006 the eads board agreed the industrial launch of the sixth iteration a350 with costs mainly borne out of cash-flow.
the a350-800 will seat 270 passengers in a 3-class cabin and has a range of  8,300 nm (15,400 km).
however, on july 17 2006, at the farnborough air show, airbus announced that the redesigned aircraft would be called a350 xwb (xtra wide body).
rolls-royce has agreed with airbus to supply a new variant of the trent engine for the a350 xwb, currently called the trent xwb, which will have a static thrust of 75000-95000 lbf.
at the same time, airbus then-ceo gustav humbert  suggested that there would be no quick fixes, stating, "our strategy isn't  driven by the needs of the next one or two campaigns, but rather by a long-term  view of the market and our ability to deliver on our promises."
the a350 will have a fuselage cross-section wider than the original a350  which used the existing airbus widebody standard.
on june 14 2006, singapore airlines announced it had selected the 787 over the a350, ordering 20 787-9s.
the a350-900 is the first to enter service in 2013 and seats 314 passengers  in a 3-class cabin.
all a350 xwb passenger models will have a range of at least 8,000 nautical miles.
for the engines airbus has confirmed that they will retain a full bleed air system on their engines, rather than the bleedless configuration used on the 787.
there was some speculation  that the revised aircraft would be called the airbus a370 or a280, with airbus  going as far as accidentally publishing an advert referring to the aircraft as  the "a280" on the financial times website.
airbus also claims that the a350-900 will have fuel  consumption per seat 7% lower than the boeing 787-9.
the last to enter service will be the a350-1000 in 2015.
the aircraft will have a cruising speed of approximately mach 0.85, similar  to the boeing 787 or boeing 747, and airbus claims that its maintenance costs  will be 10% lower than for the 787.
the a350-900 will enter service in 2013.
udvar-hazy called on airbus to bring a clean-sheet design to the table, or risk losing most of the market to boeing.
a new wing, engines and a horizontal stabilizer were to be coupled with new composite materials and production methods applied to the fuselage to make the a350 an almost all-new aircraft.
the a350 fuselage will have a constant cross-section from door 1 to door 4, unlike previous airbus aircraft.
on december 10 2004 the boards of eads and bae systems, then the  shareholders of airbus, gave airbus an "authorisation to offer  (ato)", and formally named it the a350.

however, on july 17 2006,  at the farnborough air show, airbus announced that the redesigned aircraft  would be called a350 xwb (xtra wide body).
emirates decided against making an order for the a350 because of weaknesses in the design.
airbus has yet to decide whether the forward fuselage and cockpit will be  made from al/al-li or a one-piece composite structure, like the rear fuselage.
on january 4 2007, airbus announced that pegasus aviation finance company  had placed the first firm order for the a350 xwb with an order for two  aircraft, though the variants were unspecified at the time.

udvar-hazy called on airbus to bring a clean-sheet  design to the table, or risk losing most of the market to boeing.
several days later, similar comments were made by chew choon seng, ceo of singapore airlines.
the a350 will have a common cockpit with  the airbus a380.
the airlines were not satisfied and airbus committed euro4 billion to a new design to be called the a350.
its ceo, chew choon seng, said in a statement, that "it is heartening that airbus has listened to customer airlines and has come up with a totally new design for the a350."

in april 2007, airbus chief executive louis gallois held face-to-face talks  with senior general electric management over finalizing the possible go-ahead  of a new variant of the genx engine for the a350 xwb.
the a330 and previous iterations of the a350 would only be able to  accommodate 8 passengers per row in normal configurations.
the a350 is to have large windows and will be pressurised to 6,000 feet or lower with a cabin air humidity of at least 20%.
qatar airways announced that it will use rolls royce  engines on its aircraft.
the a350 will have a fuselage cross-section wider than the original a350 which used the existing airbus widebody standard.
on october 6 2005 full industrial launch of the program was announced with  an estimated development cost of around euro3.5 billion.
airbus has yet to decide whether the forward fuselage and cockpit will be made from al/al-li or a one-piece composite structure, like the rear fuselage.
when boeing announced their 787 dreamliner project, they claimed the lower operating costs of this airplane would make it a serious threat to airbus' a330.
it was  designed to be a direct competitor to the 787-9, and 777-200er.
and wrangles about how the development would be funded.
rolls royce is the only engine supplier to date to announce that its  engines will feature on the a350 xwb.
on january 4 2007, airbus announced that pegasus aviation finance company had placed the first firm order for the a350 xwb with an order for two aircraft, though the variants were unspecified at the time.
the xwb will impose a couple of years of delay into the original timetable and almost double development costs from $5.3 billion to approximately $10 billion.
this differs slightly from the 787 design which uses ovoid skin barrels on titanium ribs.
the airbus board of directors approved the industrial launch of the a350-800 / -900 & -1000 in december 2006 .
on march 28 2006, in the  presence of hundreds of top airline executives, steven f. udvar-hazy, of ilfc  lambasted airbus' strategy in bringing to market what they saw as "a  band-aid reaction to the 787," a sentiment which was echoed by gecas  president henry hubschman.

airbus achieved its first sale of the redesigned a350 four days after its unveiling when singapore airlines announced an order for 20 a350 xwbs with options of a further 20.
initially airbus proposed a simple derivative of the a330, dubbed the a330-200lite, with improved aerodynamics and engines.
this compares to the 787,  which consists of 50% composites, 20% aluminium, 15% titanium, 10% steel and 5%  the balance.
the a350-800 will seat 270 passengers in a 3-class cabin and has a range of 8,300 nm (15,400 km).

airbus also claims that the a350-900 will have fuel consumption per seat 7% lower than the boeing 787-9.
this version of the  a350 was planned to be a 250&endash;300-seat twin-engined widebody aircraft  derived from the design of the existing a330.
chew stated, "having gone to the trouble of designing a new wing, tail, cockpit" and adding advanced new materials, airbus "should have gone the whole hog and designed a new fuselage."
it was to see entry into service in 2010 in  two versions; the a350-800 capable of flying 8,800 nautical miles (16,300 km)  with typical passenger capacity of 253 in 3-class configuration and the  300-seat (3-class) a350-900 with 7,500 nautical mile (13,890 km) range.
although airbus previously suggested boeing's use of composite materials for the 787 fuselage was premature, and that the a350's would be made from aluminium-lithium, the a350xwb is to have a composite main fuselage skin on an al/al-li frame.
during 2007 paris air show, in a major boost for the program, airbus has  won firm orders for 141 a350 xwb.
airbus had signed a firm contract with bmw to have them develop an interior  concept for the original a350.
at a press  conference december 4 2006 a few new technical details of the a350xwb design  were revealed, but no new customers were identified and john leahy indicated  existing a350 contracts were under re-negotiation due to increases in prices  compared to the original a350s contracted.
airbus responded by stating it was considering improvements for the a350 to satisfy customer demands.
