first, the 747′s united flies are powered by pratt and whitney engines.
it appears in this photo, these are general electric engines.
the new airline would be called continental & be based in houston.
cal was indeed the stronger carrier.
it is clearly evident that these are ge engines.
something tells me this merger will be clumsy and poorly unified and branded.
you should check out the night shot i did of an a380 in new ua colors as well.
we have seen the new united livery on a boeing 737, but now we can see it on the boeing 747.
when united and continental announced their new official livery and released that official shot of artist’s rendition 777 flying away, i was bothered by both the poor perspective of the picture and by the less than quality work of wrapping the name on fuselage.
take helicopter lessons to earn your ppl-h licence.
and i am not a fan, the idea of basic livery is nice but it lacks excitement.
personally, i think co’s colors are clean and nice and i also like ua’s current blue as well.
too bad for you the fact is united was financially stronger than co at the time of the merger, and co was the one who analysts were saying was not strong enough to survive in the long term.
by the way, i can tell this is the unfinished picture i shared with some friends at continental.
further, there is a oily streak on the tail – hardly something you would find on a newly painted aircraft.
the airline industry, as i knew it, is gone.
the more i keep seeing the new livery in photos the more i seem to like it.
it’s going to be all coach-class, code-shared with skywest, and seat-belts for sale.
those leaving negative comments must have short memories when 20 years ago continentals service left much to be desired.
continental worked with the globe because the globe is made up of continents, hence continental, but what’s the relationship to united?
btw,even if pix is “fake” it represents what the co 20 year old new livery will look like.
please, the further away from the bad taste united has left in many frequent fliers mouths, the better we are.
let’s just keep the “u” logo..it’s more familiar and most united people would rather have it than anything from co.
in my final version i had corrected mistakes like the tail paint bleeding over the leading edge of the vertical stabilizer.
thumbs up from me…even if this a photoshop job.
but hey, its life all who dont like it can just leave, life is a choice here, i couldnt give a crap as to how the airplanes will look and what logo should stay or go,,all i want is my paycheck on payday.
all logos, airlines, and aviators found at lost aviators.
it sure looks like a toy that has been painted…the reflection on the side doesn’t look right.
update: this photo is in fact a photoshop.
it was easy to modify pics of co jets, but harder to paint planes that co has never flown, like the 747-400.
it’s pretty obvious that the tulip is far more popular and reknowned then the weak continental globe…i believe united is making a huge mistake…hopefully, this is just a temporary scheme and smisnek gets his ego out of his ‘globe’ and creates a livery where all sides will be satisfied.
it is the most generic, dull and thoughtless compromise imaginable and just shows that this deal was done simply because of the usual misguided idea the bigger is better, which it rarely is.
a ceo named gordon bethune came along and gave the airline to the employees who took it from “worst to first” where it remains today.
[...] i actually think it looks best on this smaller airbus a319 than it has on the boeing 777 or in a boeing 747 mock up.
gee,all of the new united ac will be retro livery!!!!
we have seen the new united livery on a boeing 737, but now we can see it on the boeing 747.
just look at the miss match mess of (liveries) ua aircraft sitting on the ramp today.
ual survives on legacy status, not performance.
the co livery looks like something from the 1980′s.
thanks to everyone who liked the quality (if not the livery itself).
but it still shows very closely what the new united livery will look like on the boeing 747.tweet yee haw!
remember, ual took over co…even though that smizek guy may be trying to run the show… you really believe that….. wow.. sadly delusional.
i have flown on both airlines both domestic and international and i can truly say, the united flights were some of the most miserable experiences a very frequent flier has ever been forced to endure.
it’s always down low and not visible from the front.
surprised to hear so many negative comments.
now a truly winning team has got a giant sh*t sandwich that everyone’s got to take a bite of….
if any of you are not onboard with that and the changes that are coming, now would be a good time to look for another place to work.
cheaper to paint united on the side than grind down that shit-grey-faded-oil-streaked mess of a fleet they maintained.
fugly!lol c’mon guys, this livery looks old and tired.
the best of both companies will live on… that photo breaks my hart i cant believe how human can behave like this, ok, so 2 airlines are coming together,we dont like it
as a designer i have always felt the globe should have been reversed on the tail – with the no pole flying forward with the direction of flight.
i also have a 787 pic modified as well on that facebook page.
better fleet, better technology, better looking fas (that didn’t pose for the tail of alaska…or frontier), and they did it without liquidating pensions and laying off nearly 18% of their pilots.
take helicopter lessons to earn your ppl-h licence.
i think it looks good, but i do think they could have come up with something a bit more original than just adding united to the continental livery.
you get better service and smiles from the post-office.
united’s real logo looks better than this crap.
i apologize for posting it saying it was a real photo, i was fooled as well.
i apologize for posting it saying it was a real photo, i was fooled as well.
sorry, its photoshop ua planes have 10 windows in zone 2 where this one has 11, also on ua planes the windows start right after door 2 and this one they dont.
logos shouldn’t be backwards to the flow/direction of the airplane.
the new united marketing people know that the current livery is connected to and reflects that winning attitude and service.
this scheme is make-do and will not last too long, fortunately.
i especially like this photo since we are not use to seeing these old continental colors on a boeing 747.
a supremely confident and aggresively competitive airline as born out by it’s many recent route announcements, including immediately countering aa’s lax – pvg (shanghai) expansion.
but the globe is oriented backwards to the airflow.
the continental livery was long in the tooth way before the merger.
well i sure am glad to see i am not the only airplane nerd that checks this daily.
co had not turned down 1st merge down when houston based bush was pres.
i especially like this photo since we are not use to seeing these old continental colors on a boeing 747.
the united airlines boeing 747-400 have pw engines.
they are not about to let aa dilute their shanghai business traffic unchallenged, which until now was routed thru sfo.
but it still shows very closely what the new united livery will look like on the boeing 747.
looks more like a flash from a camera.
at least jeff wants the appearance of making it work before he checks out a billionaire.
united made have initiated the merger but the new company ended up with mostly continental management and policies.
train for a career running ahelicopter charter company.
olllllld planes, surly attendants, canceled flights.
continetal always planned to just wait until ual went belly up (about 18 more months at the rate they were going) and then just buy the pieces that made sense.
boeing 747-400 in new united airlines livery by david parker brown, on october 22nd, 2010 at 12:00 pm the new united airlines livery on a boeing 747.
changing it sends a very powerful and unmistakable message that this united is ‘new’.
i only pray continental can bring them up to there standards.
they’ve thrown out two babies and kept the loads of bathwater.
i’d like to see the current ua livery,blue/white, with co globe on the tail.
great job on the photoshopping but the aircraft used for this photo has ge engines, united uses only p&w’s.
united should be happy the big banks and the obama adminstration crammed this merger down cal’s throat.
i just wish i knew more things like, how many windows in zone 1.
it has been picked by the employees and will be honored and remembered on a new united retro jet.
it relates because smisek has an ego and he wants something from continental in the new united, and even though he knows it is crap, he needs it.
and for the record, if the reflections are wrong, then they are wrong on the original photo, because i transfered them straight across with the exception of a little on the tail which didn’t lend well the globe design.
i think united current color scheme is a illion times better.
i think this new livery is simple, clean and classy.
p.s i would have rather seen the co livery kept toatlly the sunlight reflections doesnt seem to be natural light.
if they had of kept ua’s current livery it would have signaled to everyone, consumer and employee alike, that this was business as usual…just another takeover like any other.
the scheme united has right now is beautiful, modern, and way better than this crap which was never good to begin with.
this livery looks absolutely terrible.
