he believes the plane will be seen as an interim plane, bypassed by the next generation of single-aisle aircraft, serving a niche market that he believes is much smaller than bombardier forecasts; that it will be an orphan aircraft, without a family to buy “up” to; and it will enter the low-end of the boeing and airbus markets.he believes the plane will be seen as an interim plane, bypassed by the next generation of single-aisle aircraft, serving a niche market that he believes is much smaller than bombardier forecasts; that it will be an orphan aircraft, without a family to buy “up” to; and it will enter the low-end of the boeing and airbusleahy also predicted orders from leasing companies, signaling improving economies.the a350 program has now sold 472 firm orders, a rate leahy and the statistics say is faster than the boeing 787.reskinning the 777 would be a massive undertaking and essentially amount to an entirely new airplane.the possibilities include and entirely new aircraft; re-winging the -300er; putting new engines on; and putting a composite fuselage on the airplane.now these orders can finally be booked at airbus and on its website.ceo thomas enders started the briefing saying that he thought it be more productive for airbus to recap the week, with orders to talk about, than to start the week with nothing to say.boeing offered up top program officials while eads offered up two american crewmen from its test flight program, a pilot and a boom operator.the breakdown is 128 a320s (70 from dubai); 11 a330s; 98 a350s (30 from dubai); and 10 a380s, though four of these were ordered instead of the carrier taking four test airplanes, so this is only a net gain of six.one hundred of the orders, however, are left over from the dubai air show–the contract was signed at farnborough, but these can’t truly be considered a part of this air show.this tally is also airbus’ second best farnborough air show, following the one two years ago when 280 orders were announced.one of the biggest, from dubai aerospace enterprise (dae), signed a contract with airbus for 100 planes was merely confirming the order announced last november at the dubai air show.boeing’s briefing was a standard presentation followed by q&a; most of the briefing was taken up by the formal presentation.the wall street journal today had this interview with boeing ceo james mcnerney that indicate it is a remote possibility that boeing will bid a tanker based on the 777 instead of rebidding its kc-767.
