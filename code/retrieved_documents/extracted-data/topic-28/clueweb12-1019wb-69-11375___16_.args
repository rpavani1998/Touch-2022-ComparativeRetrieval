with environmentalists and the slumping economy putting pressure on the industry, boeing is considering a bridge model that would provide a 10 percent improvement until a replacement is ready, according to the current edition of aviation and the environment magazine.boeing officials are clear that they want bcc to be the lender of last resort for its customers, and bcc officials are pounding the pavement looking for financing for its customers so bcc doesn’t have to step up.as we pointed out some weeks ago, this is highly unusual: china historically has been a stalwart through bad times for airbus and boeing, growing and ordering airplanes when other regions in the world were going through major downturns.this would necessitate a massive structural change of the 737, with the introduction of a new wing, taller landing gear and a redesigned wingbox.the combined fuel burn improvement of these measures could be as much as ten per cent – potentially making it very attractive to airlines as a “bridge” aircraft… please see the upcoming issue of the magazine for the full report.the consensus is that airbus and boeing will begin seeing serious declines in aircraft deliveries as early as next year.this has led some to particularly point to the new airbus assembly facility in china as a risk factor for airbus.boeing is quietly studying how to improve the 737 next generation, according to sources quizzed for a report in the december/ january issue of aviation and the environment, who all have knowledge on some level of the boeing studies.boeing has consistently maintained that it can complete flight testing within 6-9 months after first flight, but given the track record of its predictions so far, we’re inclined to side with jp morgan and goldman and go with one year after first flight.based on conversations we’ve had with boeing insiders, the unions and others, we believe the first flight is likely in the june-august 2009 period.profile: boeing capital corp. industry officials and observers fret that the capital market crunch will make it difficult for airlines to finance airplanes through the rest of this year and well into next.until boeing clearly is positioned to achieve first flight with the 787, doubts remain and the company’s credibility is shot.during our private conversations with them, we came away more comfortable that for 2009 at least, the two companies are not going to see major declines in deliveries, based on current market conditions.there is room for the situation to deteriorate further on wall street, as 8 of the 17 analysts following ba rate the shares a “buy” or better, according tozacks.com.conner comes from a top position in sales but has a solid background in supply management and this is his new position position within bca–something that has been a key stumbling area for the 787.
