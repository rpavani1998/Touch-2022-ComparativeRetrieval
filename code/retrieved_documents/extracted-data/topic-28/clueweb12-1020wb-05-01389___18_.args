this will keep pressure on airbus for the euro-dollar exchange rate and complicates airbus’ decisions over production for the a350.productivity efficiencies will be important to keep costs down.the situation has changed so dramatically in just the last seven days that we are now concerned there will quickly be a financing crisis for the airlines.by outsourcing work to these countries, aviation’s big four are creating new competitors.exim or eca or not, there still have to be viable banks and general market liquidity available for the credit agencies to provide guarantees for the funding.the orders, especially for the 787, are a great asset for ilfc and will be an important part of any sale of the company.they want all the work done there, which isn’t practical, and we want flexibility and we’ll come in between.we don’t have a figure for airbus, but we believe that most of its backlog is similarly eligible for the european credit agency (eca) financing.a350 looks good on paper and we have the resources to invest the r&d necessary to respondthe taxpayers, if you believe boeing’s assertions that northrop’s kc-30 is too big, too costly, and will (essentially) bankrupt the usaf in 40-year life-cycle operating costs.here are some excerpts: with no us bailout package on the table, the aviation finance market remains frozen unable to make sound decisions in an uncertain climate.in boeing’s case, the company has said on several occasions that about 83% of its backlog may be financed by the us export-import bank.we need to make sure we have process in place” to outsource work, support our marketing efforts.this compares with the widely reported figure of $100 million to $110 million a day, which was actually deferred or “lost” revenue, but which is also quite a bit higher than it should be because these figures don’t take into account the unaffected businesses within boeing commercial airplanes that continue to produce revenue:only 3% of our backlog has been financed by boeing.
