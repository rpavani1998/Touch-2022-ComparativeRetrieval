but with no active sales campaigns ongoing for the 747-8, other than a potential long-term deal to replace air force one, lufthansa faces the serious prospect of being the only airline customer for the passenger version, and this in itself could have financial implications for boeing such as residual value guarantees.

(in a bit of unintentional and inadvertent brilliance, mcnerney may get bailed out of some displeasure over the 787 delays if the recession -- in the form of reduced passenger traffic -- and lower fuel prices make airlines less impatient to get the planes they've ordered.)
fostering a "yes-man" environment under the guise of "teamwork" inhibiting free voicing of legitimate program and technical concerns.
