down to 827 as of june this year.).”
no pax versions sold?
the a-350-1000 only has about 75 orders, or so.
main research work by jon ostrower ( i thought this was required reading in the field and could be assumed background knowledge;-? )
“it appears that airbus is willing to let boeing have the lower end  of the widebody market, while it concentrates on the high end.
while the a330-200 will cost more to operate than the  787-8, the larger passenger and cargo capacity will generate more revenue and  make the aircraft more profitable, airbus argues.
but it may have to struggle against the a-3510 if airbus improves that model to more of what the me airlines want, not in its “new” current form.
forty-two orders for the -800 in the first two years of the original 2014 entry-into-service have switched to the larger -900, but more than 100 orders remain.
best price for 787 seems to have been $67m ( for an average of $76m for about the first 400 sales).
that already appears to be the case for both the 787-8 and the a350-800, with the lack of orders for both a/p’s.
on topic the a350-800 as a shrink from the -900 will no doubt be heavier then the 787-9 as a stretch of the 787-8.
the conclusion comes following the announcement at the paris air show that the -800 will be delayed two years and the a350-1000 by 18 months.

prices are with engines but without buyer furnished equipment.
@ewe: “boeing floats the -10 on a regular basis without creating tangible interest ( done for taking focus away from the -8 is my guess ).
i think it will end production (but still be offered) within 10 years, or so.
is it because airbus has been less successful in the new build freighter market than boeing has?
the b-787-10, if it ever becomes a reality will need a bigger wing, more powerful engines (maybe the rr trent-xwb?), and stronger mlg.
only boeing could or would not bring it off.
so, something about the size of the b-788 must be right.
the numbers are somewhat skewed because bernstein doesn’t separate the a330-300 out into the 777 marketplace.
aviation history confirms, that if an aircraft is not too big when it goes into service, within reason, it will soon be too small!
i believe both the b-787 and a-350 will be successful airplanes, although for different reasons.
the 787-8 has sold more than 500 of the approximately 850 787s ordered to date.
bernstein projects airbus and boeing deliveries through 2015.
but, to bernstein’s disappointment, the passenger capacity remains the same at 350.
has_ very interested customers to be.
well the -10 isn’t really being offered yet per se so its hard for boeing to offer it like the a359….
what does “best price for 787 seems to have been $67m ( for an average of $76m for about the first 400 sales)” come from?
http://www.aspireaviation.com/2011/07/11/boeing-787-a-dream-almost-come-true/ i hope garuda have this aircraft.
in conjunction with the -800′s rescheduling, airbus announced that 42  orders shifted from the -800 to the -900.
yes, both have composits as their fuselarge, but the b-787 also uses that for the wings, the a-350 does not, it uses a metal wing.

eis for the -900 has slipped to late 2013 and many—including bernstein—expect it to slide to 2014, with a mere eight predicted for delivery.
while slightly more than 100 orders  remain and airbus denied market questions about whether the -800 will survive,  one aerospace analyst would view cancellation of the -800 in a positive light.
given all other factors equal/less important (price, comfort, (engine) commonality, payload-range)
it will probibly be true for the a-330, b-777, etc.
i’ll agree, the world freighter market (excluding military cargo and tanker aircraft) is not huge, a current backlog of less than 300 aircraft, spread among the a-332f, b-763erf, b-772lrf, and b-747-8f.
this is a boeing first and that is a boeing first, blab bla.

many of the a350s which airbus will deliver are at the discounted price of the original a350…talk about discounts.
“it appears that airbus is willing to let boeing have the lower end of the widebody market, while it concentrates on the high end.
bearing in mind the a350-800 on its own competes against both the 787-8 and the 787-9, a350-800 sales aren’t impressive.
“adding freighters to suggest some balance is non-sense and even those haven’t sold well.”

airbus denies is plans to cancel the -800, which competes with the boeing  787-9.
and you are still idling in the boeing marketing trap.
also, 6-7 years ago, the b787 list prices were much less then they are now.. …and to think airbus isn’t “insidious only their scheme “…please… i wrote about the immiment but not much advertised a380-900 as a comparison to the number girl 787-10
the xwb gets a black wing.
all that “revolutunary high tech” was just fireworks for the great unwashed public.
here is the story we did last week for commercial aviation online.
boeing  dominates the upper middle-twin aisle deliveries with the 777 while airbus  holds a slight lead in the lower twin-aisle markets.
intriguing, we know what’s happening in the nb segment and boeing hasn’t delivered a single passenger vla for the last 6 yrs & has a backlog of a few dozen.
the numbers are somewhat  skewed because bernstein doesn’t separate the a330-300 out into the 777  marketplace.
date: 06/07/2011 10:29 bernstein research, in a 1 july report on eads focusing on airbus, sees a risk of cancellation of the a350-800 – a move that it views “positively”.
date: 06/07/2011 10:29 location: seattle by: scott hamilton bernstein research, in a 1 july report on eads focusing on airbus, sees a  risk of cancellation of the a350-800 – a move that it views  “positively”.
the a330-300 competes with the 777-200er and the a350-900/1000  compete with the 777-200er and 777-300er respectively.
the a320neo is scheduled to begin delivery in october 2015.
none have been ordered since airbus officially anounced the improvement package at last month’s pas, even though word was out before then (by scott).
i don’t know that there will be a b-787-10, boeing has been riding the fence of that model.
airbus believes the 787 is generally sized too small and seems content to let the a330-200—which is slightly larger than the 787-8—defend this market segment.
but, to bernstein’s disappointment, the passenger capacity  remains the same at 350.
apropos uwe, apologize about the misspelling of your name… well, ok, but be more carefull next time or i send my minions ( http://www.ironsky.com boeings “say so” is in contrast to reality on a regular basis.
“keesje, isn’t that also true for the last several production years of the a-300-600r?
i think the comment regarding “giving away the plane” was in lieu of the fact had boeing known in advance they would have sold so many frames, they wouldn’t have as heavily discounted the launch frames.
airbus  rescheduled the -1000 in order to allow rolls-royce to provide a slightly  larger engine to enable the aircraft to go another 400nm with an increased  payload.
the b-777′s early success is partly because the md-11 never did meet its promised performance goals, and the a-342/3 had poor hot runway performance.
when they enter their final sales years too.
boeing, however, is not willing to cede the high end to airbus.”
yes they have lost customers-but it certainly isn’t due to the b787′s capabilities-more to do with the fact many of the carriers simply cannot afford to purchase the plane or have had a change in business plans.
over the years i have come to the conclusion that boeing wanted to bind potential airbus customers at all costs and by all means thinkable but never planned beyond i.e. to be actually able to fullfill that orderbook instead hoping for a major contraction during the then looming us^h^hgfc which wasn’t all that unexpected as most people seem to think.
thats about 50% of an already floored listprice i think ( based on realistically unachievable ( not only in hindsight ) production simplifications.
if so, history may well repeat itself, because airbus coming out with the a350 after boeing launched the 787, had the benefit of improving on the existing 787 design, as boeing did with the 777, three years after the md-11 and a340 had been launched, making the 777 the record breaking wide-body airplane it still is today!
again, the same went with airbus and their a380 and a350 program…..
bernstein views the -800 “as the least attractive of the family and  believe it is ultimately at risk of cancellation—which we would view  positively,” the 1 july report says.

….$76 is low, but it doesn’t include engines, etc.

it cannot stay at the same weight as the b-787-9.
some of the numbers i’ve read for both the a350 and a380 are inclusive…..and again, without being tautological, many of the a350 orders are for the original “mark-i” version of the a350…and afaik, carriers such as qr will be paying the “mark-i” version..not the xwb version… of interest: “aspire aviation has learned one important contributing factor to boeing’s optimism in the payload/range performance, as well as the superior fuel burn performance of the 787-10x is the weight reduction opportunities being realised on the 787-9, which aspire aviation‘s source says is “moving ahead of the curve” with little to no overweight issue.”

hillinga: “appears to be in the stronger position compared to the 787-10 and that well may be the reason why boeing is having a tough time getting commitments for it!”
airbus delayed the -800, officials said, to  concentrate resources on the a350-900.
keesje, isn’t that also true for the last several production years of the a-300-600r?
how often does airbus do the numbergirl thing with that future subtype ?
while the a330-200 will cost more to operate than the 787-8, the larger passenger and cargo capacity will generate more revenue and make the aircraft more profitable, airbus argues.
the question tends to be how well matched materials selection and design methodology are and how well they are composited in a synergetic way.
i keep thinking airbus is the best but boeing seems to be leading.
airbus denies is plans to cancel the -800, which competes with the boeing 787-9.
down to 827 as of june this year.).
your argument lacks coroborating facts ( actually plain wrong).
still i’m curious how bernstein concluded “airbus holds a slight lead ..in the vla business”
when they enter their final sales years too.”
thanks for the links uwe!
the b-77w will eventually kill off the a-333, too.
while slightly more than 100 orders remain and airbus denied market questions about whether the -800 will survive, one aerospace analyst would view cancellation of the -800 in a positive light.
the 787-9 would be a more efficient platform.
adding freighters to suggest some balance is non-sense and even those haven’t sold well.
some airlines bought both airplanes.
so airbus supporters just ignor that segment of new build airplanes entirely?
i believe the b-787-8 has about 450 to 500 orders, including the orders converted from the aborted b-787-3.
airbus delayed the -800, officials said, to concentrate resources on the a350-900.
the a-350-800 has just over 100 orders.
the 787-8 has sold more than 500 of the approximately 850 787s ordered to  date.
i don’t see how the a-350 is an ‘improved’ design over the b-787.
but they are still new builds for each oem, and each one counts in the total sales record for that basic airplane (a-330, b-767, b-777, and b-747).
bernstein views the -800 “as the least attractive of the family and believe it is ultimately at risk of cancellation—which we would view positively,” the 1 july report says.
the boeing 787-8 and the morbid moribund 767 compete with the a330-200 for  the lower end.
they have continuously lost customers for the -8(and -9)even though those frames were ordered at prices significantly below the competitions typical pricing (going through a max 910?
you might want to check your dictionary for the difference between “the morbid 767″ and “the moribund 767″. freudian slip, perhaps.
eis of the -1000 is now slated for 2017.
a visiting member of the royal saudi family, departed on one hot day from dfw to ruh in an a-342 also took up most of rwy 17r. but sales wise, the a-343 sold reasonable well, not so for a-342/5/6.

boeing floats the -10 on a regular basis without creating tangible interest ( done for taking focus away from the -8 is my guess ).
i wouldn’t mind if you show us some proof links about it?
the conclusion comes following the announcement at the paris air show that  the -800 will be delayed two years and the a350-1000 by 18 months.
do you have any proof of that?
airbus holds a slight lead in the single-aisle market and the very large  aircraft segment.
ahhhh, now it makes sense.
the a330-300 competes with the 777-200er and the a350-900/1000 compete with the 777-200er and 777-300er respectively.
so that would be about $100 for “full product”..
i asked about the previous poster regarding the -10

the a330-300 could go on for a bit longer – at least until the 787-10 comes on stream.
boeing, however,  is not willing to cede the high end to airbus.”
compare the -10 to the a380-900 ( which certainly _
my understanding is that all prices ( published list, rebated ) are sans engines and accessories and thus comparable ?
boeing dominates the upper middle-twin aisle deliveries with the 777 while airbus holds a slight lead in the lower twin-aisle markets.
based on what each has already sold, the b-787 about 800, and the a-350 about 550, each has proven to be what the customer airlines want.
ironically, the same may be said for the 777-300er vs. the slightly smaller a350-1000.
i suspect airbus has been peddling the ‘improved’ a-3510 even before scott released his story here.
at dfw, the lh a-343 would, in the hot texas summer, use up over 12,000′ of our 14,300′ long runways as it departed at, or near its mtow.
i don’t think the a330-200 is long for this world.
but they certainly are insidious only their scheme didn’t work out as planned.
i also think airbus will cancel the a-358, as boeing did with the b-783.

in fact, to the contrary, boeing has been “telegraphing” for quite some time that a b787-10 will come out..it would be an excellent a333 replacement.
airbus holds a slight lead in the single-aisle market and the very large aircraft segment.
of course, but for the 747-8, it’s the starting sales years where freighters dominate, a first imo.

airbus, by delaying the a35-1000 to be powered with more powerful and newly developed rr engines, appears to be in the stronger position compared to the 787-10 and that well may be the reason why boeing is having a tough time getting commitments for it!
airbus believes the 787 is generally sized too small and seems content to  let the a330-200—which is slightly larger than the 787-8—defend  this market segment.
i think you are right about the a-332 not being long for this world.

your comments are in contrast to what boeing management is stating regarding the -10.
i don’t think boeing management is dumb.
airbus has seen cancellations for the a350 as well…… do you think airbus didn’t price its a350′s at “significantly below the competitions typical pricing”?
at the same time, airbus announced an 18 month rescheduling of the a350-800  to divert resources to the a350-900, the first of the three models planned to  enter service, now promised for late 2013–a slide of at least a half year  already.
