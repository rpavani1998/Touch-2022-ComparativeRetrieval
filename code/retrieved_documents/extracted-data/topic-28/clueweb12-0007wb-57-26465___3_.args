i agree that boeing's reliance on a multitude of suppliers could cause design and construction problems.boeing can only remain competitive if it has a strong rivalry with airbus.the result being delays and cost overruns from incompatible design work.we are available for interviews, and appreciate feedback and suggestions.boeing has as many (or more) suppliers as airbus does - but no co-equal prime contractor as airbus had.but boeing is using this software solely on its current and future airframes while airbus has been forced to make do with the french design team using dassault and the german team using siemens and sap.the "innovation deficit in germany" reminded me of the difficulties that airbus is having with the a380.boeing admitted today, 1/25/07, that the 787 might be delayed because of problems with the inflight wireless entertainment system.the suppliers will not design but rather construct.the way i understand it is that boeing used the dassault software to design and then construct all the plane and then put the various pieces out to bid or assignment.both boeing and airbus are using virtual construction software from the dassault systems of france.so far i think only the 787 uses this method but boeing has hired dassault for all of its next generation of airframes.my understanding is that the german airbus design team and german politicians with board seats on airbus and eads are adamant that dassault's software not be used except in france.then these schematics are constructed at boeing and its various suppliers using the plans that the software vetted.i would think that any problems that do come up would be due to economic or political instability in the suppliers host country.
