while the a330-200 will cost more to operate than the 787-8, the larger passenger and cargo capacity will generate more revenue and make the aircraft more profitable, airbus argues.based on what each has already sold, the b-787 about 800, and the a-350 about 550, each has proven to be what the customer airlines want.yes they have lost customers-but it certainly isn’t due to the b787′s capabilities-more to do with the fact many of the carriers simply cannot afford to purchase the plane or have had a change in business plans.over the years i have come to the conclusion that boeing wanted to bind potential airbus customers at all costs and by all means thinkable but never planned beyond i.e. to be actually able to fullfill that orderbook instead hoping for a major contraction during the then looming us^h^hgfc which wasn’t all that unexpected as most people seem to think.if so, history may well repeat itself, because airbus coming out with the a350 after boeing launched the 787, had the benefit of improving on the existing 787 design, as boeing did with the 777, three years after the md-11 and a340 had been launched, making the 777 the record breaking wide-body airplane it still is today!airbus, by delaying the a35-1000 to be powered with more powerful and newly developed rr engines, appears to be in the stronger position compared to the 787-10 and that well may be the reason why boeing is having a tough time getting commitments for it!airbus believes the 787 is generally sized too small and seems content to let the a330-200—which is slightly larger than the 787-8—defend this market segment.boeing dominates the upper middle-twin aisle deliveries with the 777 while airbus holds a slight lead in the lower twin-aisle markets.airbus holds a slight lead in the single-aisle market and the very large aircraft segment.the 787-9 would be a more efficient platform.bernstein views the -800 “as the least attractive of the family and believe it is ultimately at risk of cancellation—which we would view positively,” the 1 july report says.bearing in mind the a350-800 on its own competes against both the 787-8 and the 787-9, a350-800 sales aren’t impressive.date: 06/07/2011 10:29 location: seattle by: scott hamilton bernstein research, in a 1 july report on eads focusing on airbus, sees a risk of cancellation of the a350-800 – a move that it views “positively”.date: 06/07/2011 10:29 bernstein research, in a 1 july report on eads focusing on airbus, sees a risk of cancellation of the a350-800 – a move that it views “positively”.while slightly more than 100 orders remain and airbus denied market questions about whether the -800 will survive, one aerospace analyst would view cancellation of the -800 in a positive light.
