this makes sense because they still make money even with the discounts and can use the cash to pay for the concessions they are having to give to keep some of the airbus a380 orderers on board.they are both desperately needed, the 380 because so many resources have been used and the 350 to protect airbus core market in midsize aircraft.the skyrocketing of fuel prices (which made the 787 a huge order-book hit) and the long delay in the 380 launch have strengthened boeing's hand a great deal.good examples were the delays on the boeing 747 (which almost bankrupted the company) and the a380 debacle.the stock of the european planemaker's parent rose just 0.8 percent over the last two years, while boeing surged 51 percent.http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/fn/4904992.html one thing of interest is that the airbus 350 xwb seesm to be more than 4 years behind the 787, with initial deliveries of the 350 in 2013 with the first 787 scheduled for delivery in 2008.there may be difficulties manufacturing the all-carbon frame which the hybrid approach aleviates, but the latter appraoch is heavier and less fuel-efficient plus there are questions raised on how well it will work in service due to different cooefficients of expansion/retraction between the different materials.so airbus had its best day ever yesterday, with an astounding $45 billion single day list of orders [fr] (boeing: 1.4 billion…) interestingly enough, the wall street journal editorial page, which loves predicting airbus’ demise, has not commented yet…bloomberg about the plane makers' order books: boeing's total for the year as of may was 417, more than double the orders at airbus, which said on june 7 it had a total of 201 contracts through the end of may.so the speculation was that the cargo version would take too much engineering talent for only 10 aircraft; talent which would be better-used on the a350 xwb project (which apparently is hurting due to the a380 delays).the additional costs of the debacle and the concession pricing they are having to give on the a380 are probably pushing that figure up quite a bit.a cautionary fact is that there are usually major delays with *all-new* aircraft.2007 superfrenchie: so airbus had its best day ever yesterday, with an astounding $45 billion single day list of orders [fr] (boeing: 1.4 billion…) interestingly enough, the wall street journal editorial page, which loves predicting airbus’ demise, has not commented yet… bloomberg about the plane makers' order books: boeing's total for the year as of may was 417, more than double the orders at airbus, which said on june 7 it had a total of 201 contracts through the end of may.at the same time airbus and boeing also launched update projects for the 330 (the 350 project) and for the 747, respectively.another potential problem is that the 350 xwb project may not be an adventerous enough design to prevail against the 787.but airbus appeared to be in a similarly enviable position in 2003 before the 380 debacle came out - so that is reason for caution.
