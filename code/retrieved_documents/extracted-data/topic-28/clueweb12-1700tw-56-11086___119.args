a visitor from india posted sat november 19, 2005: great picture, in the sense that it conveys the enormous size of this great bird also it gives a perception of motion what with the landing gear being retracted.
the timing is remarkable, to be in that position at just the right time for the head-on shot as the gear is halfway up...great composition!

by member tjchelyaba aviation photography.
the way you've captured coming straight towards you over the runway is fantastic!!!
a visitor from united kingdom posted tue december 18, 2007: i'm no photography expert but what a fantastic shot!!!
this photograph makes it more and more apparent that this is a vertical nosed take off.
it looks like it played through the fire and flames on frets on fire and failed.
a visitor from united kingdom posted sun may 27, 2007: an amazing photo and rather surprising !
amazing photo, perfectly centered, perfectly timed, perfect location, words are useless at this point.
wow a visitor from united states posted mon october 19, 2009: can see how strong b747 is.

a visitor from australia posted fri may 26, 2006: this awesome bloody stunning picture.
a visitor from united kingdom posted fri december 1, 2006: what a site to see, you could only ever imagine what it would be like to see this beast heading towards you.
the 747 is still the most beautifull aircraft.
the corridor passes over the runways allowing for shots like this.
commercial faves by member theottspotter you can almost smell the jet fuel...
for the skeptics: i've used google earth to look at a 2004 sat image of the runway and determined the amount of runway shown is 728 feet.
i'm sure that a telephoto lens changes perspective.
a visitor from united states posted tue february 8, 2011: seeing a photo of the front of a 747 taken from the air, with the runway in the background is spectacular, it's certainly not an easy shot to get, and not one you see everyday.
a visitor from netherlands posted fri september 17, 2010: i have rented a cessna in santa monica before, just to be able to fly the vfr corridor overhead lax and get these awesome sights....
a visitor from russian federation posted sun january 16, 2011: it is not understandable that for the place of the photographing!
a visitor from united kingdom posted mon december 3, 2007: sorry, i don't buy this at all.

a visitor from brazil posted sat may 20, 2006: this is the most spectacular photo i've ever seen of a plane.
a visitor from united kingdom posted sat february 21, 2009: such a illusion to the eye.
a visitor from united states posted thu november 25, 2004: the angle of the shot with the 747 coming right at you & the runway in the background, the action of the gear retracting.
it's not enough to have a good equipment, photographing the moment counts!
not uncommon for jal pilots or their passengers tho.
it almost gives you a sense of vertigo a visitor from singapore posted mon february 26, 2007: the wings look like they are gonna break off.
a visitor from canada posted tue february 13, 2007: very nice picture, shows how combining all airline services in one airport per city is getting more dangerous.
it's not even at the end of the runway and has gained altitude.
i would be so happy in your place daniel werner.

neither the plane nor the photog were in any danger or doing anything out of the ordinary -- the camera just shows what we all take for granted -- some serious forces at work to lift this beast off the ground.
only the best of airliners, imho by membercyberscorpion airliners mainly, but not only action shots by member topwand show what these babies can do!
a visitor from india posted sat august 27, 2005: stunning angle.

a visitor from new zealand posted mon november 6, 2006: great picure a visitor from united states posted thu october 19, 2006: i have flown out of lax as an airline pilot and i have flown this vfr cooridor as a private pilot.
i *think* there might be enough data to determine the distance to the camera, exact angles, etc.
