a fantastic venue, great atmosphere, great crowd, awesome decor.we went saturday night, and this club is expensive for what it is, the cocktails tasted more like juices and cost too much the music was ok, the crowds were ok as well.i would recommend this club to anyone who is looking for a sophisticated and fun night out.the podium dancers are great and the lighting is quite cool.reviewed by peter | london | 1st july 2005 we went saturday night, and this club is expensive for what it is, the cocktails tasted more like juices and cost too much the music was ok, the crowds were ok as well.not a bad place, but as mentioned, if you get there too early then expect to hear the same songs a couple of times.the crowd is a better mix now and the atmosphere was excellent.reviewed by lily | london | 8th october 2005 a fantastic venue, great atmosphere, great crowd, awesome decor.with so much choice in central london now, we thought we'd try cafe de paris after not going for sometime.the major let downs are the drinks prices (normal for leicester sq though) and some of the people that get in- too many "gangsters" for somewhere that wants to appear classy; who lets people wearing white trainers into a club?the drinks are a bit pricey but what do you expect in the west end.door man great and on a whole the night was a brillaint nightx reviewed by keighly | london | 10th august 2006 cafe de paris is a great cheap thrill; it's not worth the entrance fee but it's an okkk place to go to if it's your second choice andthe food is actually really good, but again spoilt by such awful staff that seem to have an over inflated opinion of their own self importance.reviewed by naewel | london | 26th april 2006 not a bad place, but as mentioned, if you get there too early then expect to hear the same songs a couple of times.i enjoyed the excellent service on the vip table that was offered to me, the hosts were not only friendly but very good looking as well.
