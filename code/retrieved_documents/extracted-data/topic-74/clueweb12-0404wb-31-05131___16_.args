the poor are affected by their environment because they rarely escape from that environment.the bloomsbury and bayswater squares have much the same history, and no one can explain why bayswater now houses the working respectable middle class in its boarding-houses, while bloomsbury has become the home of the student and the intelligentsia, as no one can explain why london's few painters moved first from st john's wood tochelsea, and now from chelsea to camden town and hampstead , as the paris bohemians have moved from the heights of montmartre across the river to montparnasse.a 16-year-old boy is in a stable condition after being stabbed in the street outside a hotel in north-west london.in fact, it embraces not only london as a working centre, but also the dormitories of its workers.london is less of a world city than paris, and is much less cosmopolitan than new york.the city is the capital of commerce and finance.here is the bank of england; here are the city guilds, the livery companies, whose members are freemen of the city, have complete self-government and appoint their ruler in the person of the lord mayor.it is possible that the londoner's devotion to disorder will, to some extent, foil the architects and the planners.even this statement is not quite true, for, with the development of fast electric trains over a growing network of suburban lines, of the motor-car and the green line coach, london's dormitories now reach to the south coast, from eastbourne to worthing.a woman is found guilty of conspiracy in the case of a schoolboy who was stabbed to death at victoria tube station.london lacks imagination and the historic sense.the majority of the folk who sleep as well as work within the county borders belong to the working class.but the parks have been imposed on the city by authority in a past age, and the londoner's interest in the often gorgeous flower-beds is perfunctory and in the trees disastrous.frank dobie notes that there are more birds in london than in any other great city, and he suggests that this is indicative of the character of its people.the middle classes, from the poorly paid clerks to the head of businesses, are constantly trekking farther and farther from the city's centre to its outskirts and over its borders, and the greater their resources the longer is the trek.
