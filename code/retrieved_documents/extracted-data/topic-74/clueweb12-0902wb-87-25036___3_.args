with its private garden, two bedrooms and plenty of space to lounge and cook, it’s the perfect home base for exploring all that london has to offer.with a dash of creativity, there are plenty of original ways to meet people and experience a little of the true paris.a move to london, our other favorite european city, just as full of great shopping, architecture, art, history, and (almost as much) great food.posted in homes | 1 comment » january 16, 2012 by paige bradley frost paris is known for many things: its light, its bistros and, of course, its fashionably chic women.while stylish parisiennes abound in paris, the people-watching on the cobblestoned streets of montmartre is one of our favorite ways to while away a lazy afternoon on a heated café terrace.definition noun: soirée: party or gathering, with a sophisticated name to impress the uninitiated, taking place in apartments across the glimmering city of lights (usually accompanied bybeaucoup de alcohol, yummy food and much merriment).definition noun: soirée: party or gathering, with a sophisticated name to impress  the uninitiated, taking place in apartments across the glimmering city of lights (usually accompanied bybeaucoup de alcohol,  yummy food and much merriment).many wonderful restaurants will welcome kids if you go at off-peak times.as much as we love french hospitality, local parisians and expats aren’t always hanging out in cafés looking for tourists to befriend.watch out for complex digicode systems designed to keep guests out and lift-less 6th floor apartments in distant parisian destinations.on behalf of the hip paris team and our gloriously talented contributors, we wish you warm and happy holidays, and a fantastic new year full of love and success., maybe your idea of paris includes escaping the tourist traps and discovering truly local haunts – great live music at an otherwise unassuming dive bar, or a fantastic meal at your neighborhood restaurant.know the french: french children are trained to sit quietly and eat like little adults.alas, in a word, non. parisian men do, however, have distinctive style that manages to marry the rakish allure of vincent cassel or olivier martinez with the more bourgeois appeal of, say, francois cluzet.winter is winter in paris too, but when you can while away the days eating delicious pastries and drinkingcafé crème or mulled wine in a cozy café, it’s easy to become fond of the rainy days too.
