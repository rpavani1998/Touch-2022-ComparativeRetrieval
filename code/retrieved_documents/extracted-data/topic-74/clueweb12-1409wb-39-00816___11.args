stir in avocado and seeds/nuts just before serving.
as tyler durden says, you don’t own your stuff.
for once i’m actually writing this a couple of days ahead of time, because it is american thanksgiving this weekend, and i’m going to be one busy lady.
the result: a wonderful warm, slightly crunchy, slighty bready, tinged with rosemary crust that perfectly holds its own to however many or few toppings you want.
drain in colander and rinse immediately under cold water to cool.
you are getting this week’s friday fun a day early because tomorrow’s my birthday, and i took the day off work and will be staying far away from the computer all day!

there will probably not be anything particularly traditional about our thanksgiving, since i’m a vegetarian, and there’s only two of us.
if you want thin crust, either roll it out super thin and use a large pizza pan or divide it into two and make two regular-sized pizzas.
since i’m being an epically boring vegetarian librarian alternating between reading a shit-ton, weight lifting and doing chin-ups at the gym, and watching mini-marathons of teen mom 2 (for the schadenfreude aspect), i think today i’ll give you all a glance at some books on my wishlist.
other than that, my week has been quite normal.
be sure to serve with rice and maybe naan.
if you will be baking in the oven, preheat oven to 375 degrees.
i understand money is tight, trust me, i do, but all you have to do is youtube some videos of the types of mobs that happen to see how disgusting this obsession with stuff can be.
can’t wait to see what new authors and stories i’ll discover through this book.
if it’s something that takes longer to cook, like broccoli, just quickly boil it for a couple of minutes to prep before slicing it up and putting it on the pizza.
add in olive oil, rosemary, whole wheat flour, and white flour.
poor elizabeth, living in paris with a man who loves her, cooking food for him every day, giving tours of the louvre.
this comes across to me as the stitch n bitch for canning.
i also hung out with one of my friends and watched trashy horror movies.
i will probably not be able to afford them anytime soon or justify buying them since i currently have a pile of 79 physical books to read in my tiny apartment.
i have to say, ever since i turned 20, i just feel like i’m improving with age.
i have to say, ever since i turned 20, i just feel like i’m improving with age.
preheat oven to 375 degrees.
it also means i try to avoid being “militant” about anything and just hope that with the evidence i calmly present, people will change their minds.
whereas the tova gallagher series is a just for fun romance novella lite, zombies is all about the feminist scifi and horror writer inside me.
last weekend i went to a collegiate hockey game with a friend.
if you’re doing it by hand, it’s when the dough is no longer watery but still kind of sticky.
you do need to cut up the avocado and add it just before serving to prevent the avocado from browning, however.
cut corn kernels from the cob.
it was crazy fun and full of adorable 10 year old boys in bruins jerseys rooting for bc.
sprinkle baking soda and salt over the top of this and mix in.
flip it a few times to spread out the flour.
the recipe: makes 4 servings 1 can or 2 1/2 to 3 cups cooked chickpeas 1 13.5 oz can light coconut milk (double this if you’re leaving it in a crockpot all day)
place the ear of corn in and cook until a fork can easily stick into the kernels, approximately 7 to 10 minutes.
hopefully i’ll have more real life stories for you next week.
also i’m just noticing that this is an interesting mix of zombies, sex, feminism, and veg*ism.
i was out at a pub with four other gals, one of whom is vegetarian like me.
this memoir tells about her falling in love and the process of becoming an expat in france through the lens of food.
even carrots and potatoes can go on the pizza.
overall, the scenes of real paris life are interesting and enjoyable, but the frequent scenes featuring bloody meat and elizabeth’s pity party really detract from the book.
also i’m just noticing that this is an interesting mix of zombies, sex, feminism, and veg*ism.
allow the yeast to work for about a minute.
i know some vegetarians can be militant, but if the vegetarian you’re around right that instant isn’t being militant and all that happened is she stated she’s vegetarian, just nod and say “ok,” and leave it at that.
it was crazy fun and full of adorable 10 year old boys in bruins jerseys rooting for bc.
we will, however, definitely be drinking beer and watching the game.
i’ve put everything from chickpeas to black beans on mine.

i choose to be this way, because i’m a libertarian, and i believe that what a person eats is her choice, even if i disagree with it and wish she wouldn’t eat that way.

the crust is the core of the pizza, so i present to you–the perfect pizza crust.
it works for thin or thick crust.
i hope the recipes are creative and not just like “pasta, veggies, rice, have fun.”
even further fact: the nearest grocery store to me is crazy cheap and mainstream

this is marketed as a going vegan book for men written by a vegan male martial arts fighter.
in a medium-sized bowl, beat egg, then add vanilla and sugar and mix to combine.
if you actually cared about the animals, you wouldn’t eat them.
it’s supposed to blow the myth of being a male vegan equating being weak and/or not masculine out of the water.
of course one of my favorite veg restaurants will also be visited.
first, as a vegetarian, i really didn’t appreciate the incredibly long and frequent sections describing eating meat, cooking meat, how awesome meat is, etc…  where elizabeth describes her future husband, gwendal, telling her “i love you” for the first time over a piece of bloody meat, i was thoroughly distracted by the poor, dead, bleeding animal.
if you want thin crust, either roll it out super thin and use a large pizza pan or divide it into two and make two regular-sized pizzas.
you are not concerned about the well-being of the animals.
ok, that was a ridiculously excited post, but i think that’s warranted if only for the fact that i have a four day weekend.
by some awesomeness two of my best gal pals and my boyfriend also have tomorrow off, so i’ll be spending the day with them, getting bubble tea, going to a farmer’s market, and probably hitting up a bookstore too.

as a libertarian, i believe that adults should be able to do whatever they want to do as long as it doesn’t harm other living creatures.
i wound up skimming a lot.
from telling us about how lucky she is to be living this life in paris, elizabeth suddenly changes into a bit of a pity party.
the result: this recipe yields 12 regular-sized delicious, low-fat, low-calorie muffins chock full of nutty protein.
the recipe: makes 4 servings 1 can or 2 1/2 to 3 cups cooked chickpeas 1 13.5 oz can light coconut milk (double this if you’re leaving it in a crockpot all day)
maybe you’re worried that suddenly the us will become predominantly vegetarian instead of omnivore.
all i know is, you’re not being respectful of other human beings when you act this way.
just don’t spend your precious hours off obsessed with stuff.
if you will be using a slow cooker, combine all ingredients in the crockpot.

it also was surprisingly warm for a building housing an ice skating rink.
if you are a meat eater yourself and a foodie, you’ll probably enjoy this memoir anyway.
the recipe: 1 cup warm water 1 packet yeast 1 tablespoon sugar 1 tablespoon dried rosemary 2 tablespoons olive oil pinch of sea salt 1 1/8 cup whole wheat flour 1 1/8 cup white flour more flour for rolling out the dough put the water in a large bowl.
myself and the other veg turned down pizza, getting fries instead, and the omnis got a steak and potato pizza.
because of the fact that my birthday falls on a holiday weekend i tend to get my presents early or late or get informed of what i will be getting.
it took much experimenting with many pizza crust recipes and a bit of tweaking on the one i finally found that was close to what i wanted.
if you were, you wouldn’t ask for them to die so you can enjoy a hamburger when you live in a nation with plenty of other ways to healthily feed yourself.
i’ve also been told that i’m slowly starving myself to death.
you can put pretty much any veggie on top of pizza.
however, i have a serious problem with you people who purport to support organic “humane” animal farming out of a concern for the well-being of the animals and not yourself..
ok, so i could own this already, but i own the previous books in the sookie stackhouse series in mass market paperback, and the series must match.
anyway, for the most part my lack of militance is met with a similar lack of confrontation in return.
aside from having finally done my taxes and seeing i get moneys back for having been in graduate school last year and also being poor.
spread out flour on a surface.
i’ve also been taunted that i look ghostly or gaunt and clearly i must be vitamin deficient.
also, tonight i’ll be going out to dinner with my third best gal pal (there are three of them), so the celebration is nicely spread out.
stir through, cover, and bake for another 30-40 minutes, until the veggies are tender.
just grate them up and put them on right after the sauce.
i suddenly feel totally justified in getting my xbox kinect.
i’ve had omnis regale me with the sheer animalistic pleasure they feel in ripping meat apart with their teeth.
the crust is the core of the pizza, so i present to you–the perfect pizza crust.
be sure to serve with rice and maybe naan.
in a large, deep casserole dish, combine all the ingredients and stir until well-combined.
the most i do unprovoked is to say that i’m a vegetarian and sometimes further explain what my dietary restrictions are if the person doesn’t know.
take any animal from an organic farm and compare it being slaughtered to one being slaughtered at a factory farm.
by max brallier i was completely obsessed with choose your own adventure (cya) stories when i was a kid, even the craptastic fundy christian ones my parental units made me read.
it took much experimenting with many pizza crust recipes and a bit of tweaking on the one i finally found that was close to what i wanted.
however, i respect whatever choice people make, because what you eat is your own business.
also, tonight i’ll be going out to dinner with my third best gal pal (there are three of them), so the celebration is nicely spread out.
there’s red pizza (using marinara for sauce) white pizza (using olive oil and garlic for sauce) and pesto pizza (obviously using pesto for sauce).
by some awesomeness two of my best gal pals and my boyfriend also have tomorrow off, so i’ll be spending the day with them, getting bubble tea, going to a farmer’s market, and probably hitting up a bookstore too.

2 tbs olive oil avocado, finely diced bring a pot of water to boil.
although i will offer sources, i generally tweak recipes a wee bit when i make them, so if you would like to see the original recipe, definitely check out the source.
spray muffin pan or individual muffin cups with non-stick spray or vegetable oil, then divide batter evenly among cups to make 12 muffins.
that could be the vermonter in me talking though.
stir in sweet potatoes and oil.
i use a hand-held electric dough hook, but it works by hand or with a real electric mixer too.
when it’s home-made, you can actually make sure it is quite healthy, including being low-fat and low-calorie.
once he heads back for home i’ll be doing the laundry, getting in some quality gym time, and finally getting started on editing zombies.
you can put pretty much any veggie on top of pizza.
(i do take the time to order vital wheat gluten and nutritional yeast in bulk from amazon though.
i have no problem with omnivores who say they enjoy being at the top of the food chain, that we’re naturally predators so we may as well enjoy it, etc… they’ve decided what matters to them while acknowledging that this choice causes pain.
i’m also excited for him to see me looking far healthier than the last time he was here, which was almost a year ago!
gradually she falls for not just gwendal, but paris in general, especially the food.
granted, i know readers who enjoy eating meat themselves won’t be bothered by these passages, but i am fairly certain they’ll be irritated by the change of tone of voice partway through the narrative.
plop the dough on the surface.

review: this memoir starts out strong.
also, i can’t suddenly switch to ebooks for the series at this point in the game, but i would if i could.
the super-thin slices couples with the sauce makes them cook by the time you take the pizza out of the oven.
i’m very intrigued by canning but am put-off by how old-fashioned most of the recipes and methods in the cookbooks are.
paris sounds incredibly romantic and appealing to anyone who enjoys open food markets, museums, and the big city charm of small spaces.
i’ve been taunted by small time farmers who tell me all about how they’re going to slaughter the chickens that day.
they make a great breakfast or snack on the go, and are yummy warm or cold.
of course one of my favorite veg restaurants will also be visited.
i know, you guys do not care this much about my birthday, but i get four days off for it and am excited!!
i understand money is tight, trust me, i do, but all you have to do is youtube some videos of the types of mobs that happen to see how disgusting this obsession with stuff can be.
once you have the spices in stock, it’s also quite cheap!
in a sense, it’s more humane for the factory farm to slaughter their animals, because they are in pain and suffering constantly.
there will probably not be anything particularly traditional about our thanksgiving, since i’m a vegetarian, and there’s only two of us.
put the dough in an oiled bowl in a warm location.
however, it is just not cool to gleefully wave in a known vegetarian’s face that you’re eating an animal.
i know, you guys do not care this much about my birthday, but i get four days off for it and am excited!!
seriously, it grosses me out, and normally i only am able to maintain my appetite when eating with omnis by just making myself “forget” that they’re eating meat.
vegetarians get it that you like to eat meat.
there’s red pizza (using marinara for sauce) white pizza (using olive oil and garlic for sauce) and pesto pizza (obviously using pesto for sauce).
combine apple, onion, cilantro, corn, and lime juice in a large bowl.
it works for thin or thick crust.
it tastes better when it’s allowed to sit a while in the fridge.
for thicker crust, just roll it out to a regular pizza-size.
in a smaller bowl, combine white whole wheat flour, cinnamon and nutmeg.
i’m also excited for him to see me looking far healthier than the last time he was here, which was almost a year ago!

stir dry ingredients into the zucchini mixture, then fold in chopped almonds .
even carrots and potatoes can go on the pizza.
handling the undead by john ajvide lindqvist besides having the most difficult to spell name of any author on this list, lindqvist also wrote let the right one in, which i think is a wonderful twist on/addition to vampire lore.
if you’re using a dough hook, the dough is ready when it starts to climb up the hook.
you are getting this week’s friday fun a day early because tomorrow’s my birthday, and i took the day off work and will be staying far away from the computer all day!
it is hard enough for me to smell and see meat.
ya’ll know how into local food and preparing for the zombie apocalypse i am.
my dad contributed money so i could get my a/c unit, and my brother informed me he’ll be giving me homemade goat cheese he made himself from his own goats.
if you want to leave it all day, double the amount of coconut milk to 2 cans or put in one can and fill the can with water and add that to the crockpot as well.
if you will be using a slow cooker, combine all ingredients in the crockpot.
after it arrived the questioner again started gleefully shoving in our faces the fact that she was eating an animal, had earlier that day, and would continue to, repeatedly mentioning baby animals in particular.
paris sounds incredibly romantic and appealing to anyone who enjoys open food markets, museums, and the big city charm of small spaces.
the result: a wonderful warm, slightly crunchy, slighty bready, tinged with rosemary crust that perfectly holds its own to however many or few toppings you want.
even though this pissed me off, i ignored it.
once you have the spices in stock, it’s also quite cheap!
in fact, i’m pleased that for the most part, people are genuinely nice about it and express concern in the restaurant or in their house that what i eat isn’t against my morals.
i also hung out with one of my friends and watched trashy horror movies.

so it’s not always easy for me to find obscure ingredients often listed in vegan recipes.
this means that in what society sees as gray areas, i go with whatever side allows for more choice.
in a large, deep casserole dish, combine all the ingredients and stir until well-combined.
this is a cya set in the zombie apocalypse.
even if a person goes from eating meat at two meals a day to eating meat at one meal a day, that’s fewer animals being killed for food a year.

although i believe in vegetarianism, i whole-heartedly support any movement in that direction.
it also was surprisingly warm for a building housing an ice skating rink.
so i keep my mouth shut about all the reasons to be vegetarian unless they ask me, which happens a surprising amount.
my wonderful boyfriend gave me a brand-new camera last weekend, something i’ve been wanting but unable to afford for forever.
either you enjoy an easy way to make someone uncomfortable in a social situation or our choice makes you feel insecure for whatever reason.
maybe you really do feel guilty for eating meat so you lash out.
