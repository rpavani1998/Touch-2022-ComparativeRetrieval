there is no doubt whatsoever, airline travel has not only changed the way we travel, but it has also impacted on our daily lives.the airliner and the airlines have been the predominant choice for the majority of business people and holidaymaker’s alike, looking for quick, efficient and nowadays, a cheap way to travel.the distance from london heathrow to the the centre of london is approximately 15 miles, and is pretty much the same from paris (cdg) to the centre of paris.the total journey time from the centre of london to the centre of paris had taken us a measly 2 hours and 40 minutes (approx).the train system, certainly in the uk can leave a lot to be desired at times, but this has been due to the continued under investment from successive governments.expatriate, eurostar, channel tunnel traveling by air has always given the people of this planet the ability to hop from one continent to another in a matter of hours.in no time at all, we exit the tunnel to a glorious blue sky in france.after making a stop at calais, we have about an hour and twenty minutes before we reach our final destination.the aero plane has certainly made a big impact on society.the train we were due to travel on departed at 15:11, calling at calais and paris gare de nord (the north station).it seems a little dated on the english side as regards the state of the railway, but after about 35 minutes into the journey, we turn off the old victorian railway onto the brand new, recently commissioned uk high speed line and race along the kent countryside at speeds up to 300kmh (186 mph).those people who had decided to take the plane would now be fighting for taxis or taking the rer train system into city centre.it doesn’t seem long before we are going to say goodbye to england and the announcement informs us that the transit time in the channel tunnel will be approximately twenty minutes.not much difference in the price, but the travel to heathrow and also from paris (cdg) would probably equate to the same again.many years ago, the train was the lifeblood of countries and economies.
