but yeah, great female bond film.
we learn about human nature, and how our traits fare when put to the ultimate test, and also the cruel harshness of chance.
now we use a vending machine in the closest grocery store, but it only has new releases.
chemgal i'll think about what movie to add here.
my best friend at the time watched it with us and started laughing part way through, and i looked over to her, i mean,the insult!she had removed herself from the whole scene and found it quite funny that all three of us, mom, dad and me were all boo-hoo'ing.
you can also go into genres and browse lists specific to those genres (cult horror, witty fantasy, and such like).
i learned something about myself - that i should not watch movies about plane crashes at night!
when you're browsing, you can assign ratings from 1-5 stars to movies and shows you've already seen and then they assume that similarly rated movies of a similar type will also interest you.
i like films about human nature, and how we make things work, how we survive and adapt and relate.
yeah, i can see how netflix works then.
the owner and the folks at the library blame the same monster.
i was quite emotional by the end.
one night, he finds himself taken back to that time where he starts hanging out with his idols, even getting gertrude stein to critique his novel and having a rather chaste fling with picasso's mistress.
there is the young teen with down syndrome from a neighbouring farm, who she saves from a horrible life.
she sets up a program for these inner city kids, teaching them how to play the violin.
alas, it is also not the easiest movie to find at times.
youtube movies is getting better all the time but still doesn't always have what i'm after (you pay per movie rather than a monthly subscription like netflix so it's more like video store).
only downside is that the wii isn't high-definition so we can't access the hd content (xbox 360 and ps3 are better netflix clients in this regard).
a scientist awakens after a suicide attempt to find all but himself and a couple other humans have apparently vanished.
it is one of 18 movies that have done this in a major way.
they do show you the cover (if they have a cover image available) and a summary based on the back blurb.
really made me feel gross.
a couple of the younger folks at work are going the "free" download route, but i'm not totally sold on it.
you may feel downright normalliving on city island, in the bronx, vince rizzo (andy garcía), a prison guard, is the father of a dysfunctional family whose members all have secrets.
love the ending, re-inforces the importance of being true to one's self, and doing as we need.
her own daughter (who she raises alone) has a child out of wedlock, but falls in love with another woman and they are accepted as a couple raising their child together.
this movie is amazing.
it's getting the most praise (and the best box office returns) that woody's had since his heyday in the seventies and eighties so i just feel i should have liked it more than i did.
alex i recoomend "one week" it is the best movie i have ever seen.
made me feel proud of my own accomplishments and choices.
he also did some rather screwball horror-comedy films in his early years before getting all hollywood on us.
meryl streep stars as roberta guaspari, a single mother of two and a violin teacher.
most thngs i wanted to see, i could get there.
"acclaimed 1980s dramas based on books" or "cult tv series with female leads" (offered based on my giving buffy four stars) and that sort of thing.
also looks gorgeous as it takes us through the london hip scene of the period as well as a visit to paris.
it gets mystical towards the end (and the meaning of the ending is open for discussion) so may not be particularly "hard" s-f, but is certainly one of the more thoughtful s-f movies from my lifetime.
it summarizes the movie perfectly and better than i ever could have. -- living on city island, in the bronx, vince rizzo (andy garcía), a prison guard, is the father of a dysfunctional family whose members all have secrets.
elanorgold definately gonna see that one alex.
there are also some quirky villagers who the director treats with real compassion.
there are a lot of movies i really enjoy, but i'd be hard-pressed to remember them afterwards or a couple of years later.
elanorgold enjoyed watching gansta's paradise again.
true, i do often like a film that is similar to something else, but part of the fun is finding stuff you never knew about and isn't like anything else.
got out the sorceress there, starring christine boisson, which was really educational and meaningful and rare, and historical, but i'm not recommending that one, as per my one movie rule! ; ) hilary lethbridge library is still really good!
we go with the survivors through their arduous experience, share in their guilt, fear, resignation, strengths and weaknesses, ingenuity and triumphs, and leave the film changed, quiet, thoughtfull, appreciative.
without revealing this truth to his family, vince consequently gets tony out of prison and employs him as hired help at his own home in order to become closer with his unknowing son.
it is at times hard to watch, but does not glorify gore, and therefore i was able to see it through.
i think anyone who wants to know more about humanity, themselves, how it all works, and how we all fit in should see this film.
sask was very much like southern alberta.
he's always wanted to go there and is particularly enamoured of the 1920s paris inhabited by hemingway, fitzgerald, and other writers and artists that he idolizes.
having some bob in my past, the film had relevance to me.
plus, michelle was awesome in it and looked fantastic.
it is the true story of a group of young rugby players whose plane crashes in the andes in the 70's, and how they die and survive.
i live a couple of blocks away from a hospital that frequently has helicoptors landing on its' roof and i can usually see them through my bedroom window.
they are always stopping (scratched, etc).
you find things you wouldn't expect to like, or wuldn't otherwise notice.
elanorgold weeeelll, i am tempted by the films so far.
the dvd, great format, but as a rental they suck.
they're not the greatest movies i've ever seen, but still they touched my heart.
it's funny and cute and has some great one-liners and just timeless appeal.
i listened to the book on tape telling of this story by the main character in the film: nando parrado a few months ago, and was once again moved and changed.
in the end, i'd rather go to a video store or library for browsing, but like online source like netflix when i'm zero'ing in on something specific.
for stuff that we do download, i copy it to an external hard drive and connect that to a patriot box office media player.
they also take account of what you've already watched on netflix and how you rated that content.
i like to pick by the cover picture, rating, and description on the back.
they start at the beginning, conception, and the premise that "every sperm is sacred".
i just hope people will allways have access to the movie gems of yesteryear.
the library system is sadly lacking, i often have to buy a film i'm desperate to see.
trishcuit another movie i put on sometimes just for fun, it's like visiting old friends, is "the princess bride".
he looks a lot like him too.
mendalla somegalfromcan trishcuit - thanks for reminding me of that wonderful movie.
it was a funky off beat partly b&w film, and kate blanchett was awesome in it.
she played bob fantastically, her and ben whishaw were my favorite bobs.
yes, it would be useful, if you have high speed.
the film is also a celebration of being canadian, with great scenes shot in the most beautiful places, and it is also filled with great canadian music, written and recored by independant and up and coming canadian artists.
but that said, i find a lot of stuff i like on youtube through the sidebar, and on amazon through the related items there.
as for midnight in paris, i'm a big woody allen fan and this movie should, on paper, be the sort of allen film that i eat up.
we are lucky to still have two video rental places, 20 mins away.
funny, i had forgotten about that last musical number.
so, if you rate the new star trek at 5 stars, they will likely steer you to the other trek movies (they don't have any of the trek tv shows on netflix canada, but all of the movies).
still not quite like browsing a store, though, any more than looking through kobo or amazon is like browsing through a good bookstore.
it would be a drag to watch movies on our computer!
mendalla one movie i often toss out in threads like this is the quiet earth (1985, new zealand).
anyone who isn't familiar with any bob lore though, would be rather lost.
this is the most difficult part of the movie to watch as it is a rape scene.
it's post-apocalyptic, but not your typical battle for survival variety of post-apoc.
i just watched a student made trailer for the film.
i've had that feeling before too about films and albums.
that was a log time ago though, so i might be due to see it again.
netflix doesn't have it, nor does youtube movies.
it's a really sad thing if modern technology has robbed us of the chance to see older movies.
the characters are extremely well-drawn.
the widower next door becomes her "special friend" but she eschews marriage.
it also has one of the most inspiring and brillant endings of any movie.
to me, "music of the heart," is a beautiful movie - a real triumph of the human spirit.
it is a road trip story, about a young recently engaged man who is diagnosed with terminal cancer at the begining of the movie, and then takes a motorcycle trip accross canada to find the meaning of life, and what his purpose is.
however, when we watched it yesterday, it just didn't click with me until near the end.
i have sour tears in my eyes just remembering it.
elanorgold ok mendalla, i feel like a total cave woman now.
the big tease looks amusing.
ah yes, princess bride is always good.
i'd say music of the heart is more like mr. holland's opus, personally.
the two girls plot to murder the mother who tries to keep them apart, and thereafter have to spend the rest of their lives apart for their own good, one of them in a mental hospital.
somegalfromcan partially based on a recommendation here by elanorgold, last night i watched alive.

vince discovers that his secret illegitimate son is now the 24-year-old prison inmate tony nardella (steven strait) who is being held in the same prison where he works.
if you ever have late fines there just ask them to reduce them.
mendalla elanorgold wrote:elanorgold wrote: it's a really sad thing if modern technology has robbed us of the chance to see older movies.
good selection plus a free section of documentaries.
apparenlty, eric idle is the only one not on board and they are still talking to him so that could change.
on the other hand, if you're looking for a specific title or person (e.g. you crave a woody allen movie), then they have a search engine that makes the job quite easy compared to to trying to find a specific item in some stores.
mendalla actually watched a couple movies this weekend.
i used to have a 24 hr video across the street (early 90's), and would rent at least two a week, sometimes 4.
an education sounds really interesting.
i guess i liked them because they both emphasize the bond women have with each other.
plays full 1080p and can be networked using wi-fi.
you sure look different without the platinum hair!
it's a streamed service (i.e. it plays from the website to your computer).
some of them actually come up with interesting stuff.
my son recently got into gangsta's paradise, the big single from the soundtrack.
well-written, well acted, good storytelling, if a bit slow and quiet (
it is a realistic and gritty portrayal that used testimonies from the survivors to put together the scenes.
the apartment's convience store used to have a few movies for rent, and they don't even offer that service anymore.
and i'm sure encouraged my husband to keep submitting his novel in to publishers.
netflix canada seems to be better for tv shows than for movies.
for example one called farinelli: il castrati, about a rococo castralto singer i found out about on youtube.
basically, a writer visits paris with his fiancee and her parents.
my movie would be the meaning of life.
tell the audience what we will get out of watching this movie.
you hae to have all the technology for all that to work.
tell the audience what we will get out of watching this movie.
nando talks about the unbearable becoming common by the end in his own book too.
you can't burn netflix content to disc (well, i suspect there are ways, but i'm not doing it).
but, you still only see the ones that they are feeding you unless you go into a genre and click the all titles option.
you may feel downright normal elanorgold i saw beaches when it was new, ad cried through just about the whole thing.
this one really stayed with me and i've seen it a few times.
we had many a movie out from there.
lethbridge library used to be really good.
the way that roberta, her students, their families and others react is what makes the movie worth watching.
while mulligan got a lot of the attention for it, the rest of the cast is also excellent, esp.
the visions while copters arrive will fade.
waterfall so many movies, but one from a while ago, "beaches" with bette middler (tearjerker) or the colour purple.
yeah, our nearest was a blockbuster (rip) and i haven't really found anything else nearby that has decent selection other than london public library
we see life turn from normal and comfortable, as we all know it, to harsh and raw and primal, in a few seconds.
it's a wonderful antidote to the over-wrought fx gimmickery of tentpole s-f movies like those of james cameron.
smart script by nick hornby based on a memoir (forget the author) and a very well-made film overall.
good thing we still do have some video stores.
everyone is valued and accepted for who they are.
it's piracy, strictly speaking, and the quality and security of the sites and downloads, is dicey in some cases.
the movie makes you think, laugh, cry and feel joy.
the rousing "isn't it awfully nice to have a penis".
there's a netflix client for the nintendo wii (for all of the big game consoles, actually), so we have our wii connected to our home network and can then stream netflix to the tv through it.
that said, i did find the movie to be very moving - and i found it interesting how things that i found to be grotesque, at first, became bearable (and watchable) by the end.
sg our local store still rents movies.
" her "what for?" they spend time together away from everyone in a little bunkie when things get romantic.
mendalla elanorgold hmm, it's weird feeling when you feel you should like a film better.
mendalla somegalfromcan we have a locally owned video store a couple of blocks down the street.
one is fairly new and doesn't have many older films, the other has been there a while and while it isn't as big as a blockbuster, it suffices.
i picked up moneyball to watch tomorrow.
ya know, browsing the isles of the video store... mining the gems...

the patriot basically lets you take digital media content and play it on a tv without having to have a computer or network connection on the tv itself.
