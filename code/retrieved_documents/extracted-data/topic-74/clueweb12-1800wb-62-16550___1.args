i loved it here good crowd exellent music funky house and r and b. lovely staff great night out esp if you have a table!
try and get vip as you'll be able to sit and chat while the club fills up...also allows you to stay till 4am ;-) nice atmosphere, nice people!
i thought the prices were about average for a west end club, however i did find the v.i.p area a little crowded.
my favorite part was the really hot bartender from argentina, he was very nice.
thank god i knew the promoters so i got free drinks in the vip room.
doenst pull in a good crowd either.
men that work there were full of compliments towards me ( which made my bf jealous lol) and rest of staff were fine!
music wasnt too great either.
musically , along with big tunes at the moment, there was quality funky and electro house with a sprinkle of rnb so fantastic.
send to a friend simply enter the details above and this webpage will be sent.
went here last night with 2 male friends had a great night.
my friend was performing his football tricks (daniel magnus) and the crowd loved him and there was such a good atmosphere!
my lasting memory will be when i asked for a drink and the barman replied "you get f all unless you say please".
you just want to whisper in their ear: 'you just work in a nightclub darling, cut the attitude'.
not a bad place, but as mentioned, if you get there too early then expect to hear the same songs a couple of times.
reviewed by peter | london | 1st july 2005 we went saturday night, and this club is expensive for what it is, the cocktails tasted more like juices and cost too much the music was ok, the crowds were ok as well.
the major let downs are the drinks prices (normal for leicester sq though) and some of the people that get in- too many "gangsters" for somewhere that wants to appear classy; who lets people wearing white trainers into a club?
we met a promoter outside and got a good discount on the entry price and jumped the que!
not too rnb as that is getting sooo dull at the mo!
a strict door seems to keep the idiots out.
i went to cafe de paris for the third time last night, and my mates and i ended up going there because we always get vip
its so hard to get in..but once there..get some good cocktails and u are treated as a king, no doubts.

although i loved the decor the place is like a huge hotel and i felt lost half the time (maybe caused by alchohol!)

we were treated to our own table and the staff were very friendly!
the drinks are a bit pricey but what do you expect in the west end.
i ended up not going in vip at all as it was rubbish.

reviewed by farah | midlands | 7th march 2007 still a great venue.
music was just amazing although, i agree with a lot of the people commenting, the drinks were way too expensive!
sat night there was very overrated, dissapointed with the music as well as the croud.
holding over 700 people, the venue contains three separate bars in addition to the mezzanine and main dance floor—the red bar, the blue bar and the fantasy rooms (vip area).
the drinks are a bit pricey but what do you expect in the west end.
there were too many people, and it was completly crowded, the dj must have played every song more than two times, vip had far too many people in there, an it is only small so it was sooo hot.
the crowd is a better mix now and the atmosphere was excellent.
no guestlists needed usually so you can just go there if you did not plan anything else.
loads of good looking girls and not too much attitude.
very friendly staff, strict door policy but not a stupid one!
still a great venue.
i enjoyed the excellent service on the vip table that was offered to me, the hosts were not only friendly but very good looking as well.
this pplace is really great, nothing else like it in london.
i really enjoyed cafe de paris, it had all of the right ingredients.
the podium dancers are great and the lighting is quite cool.

nice venue, nice drinks, good music, if only it was dirt sheap, would be pretty much perfect then!

lighting is brilliant, sound is cool but would love to hear a little more funkier house tunes, was not too keen on the oldies!!
reviewed by sebastian | london | 7th december 2004 i dont like this club too much-its too big, and its too much space for dancing.
they were playing some top tunes from an album called sounds of the beautiful balerics by starz.
all style music and dancers.

i will definitely go back when i go back to london music was good (bit of funky vocals), drinks were good and the people were great!

i will definately be going back i really enjoyed cafe de paris, it had all of the right ingredients.
i went to this club last friday - nice place, friendly doorstaff with no bad attitudes.
the cafe suffers from having a clientele that has probably got a minibus from southend for 'traceys hen night.

but on the whole a good nite out it was gud apart from the dance and house music please play moe rnb and dancehall eg sean paul and not " the song let the sunshine " it was really bad and didnt get me in the mood for dancing until i heard some dancehall sean paul and nina sky if you played less dance and house i garantee that the night will be a total sucess and even more people wud recommend cafe de paris.
£15 entry cost on saturday nights- its probably only worth £10.

went to cafe de paris with my boyfriend on our first night in london, at first i was a bit apprehensive because id never been out in london before, but a very good looking bouncer approached us outside the club and actually invited us in.
