to make trains more competitive compared to airplanes, pricing and service are much likely a more effective way to tackle the declining passenger numbers.here’s a interesting quote from page 5 (emphasis added): new routes would need to connect the major economic centres and provide journey timesto rival air travel to make it viable.yes, the uk needs new investment into the rail lines, but putting in two new slow speed lines will give far higher capacity at a lower cost.one reason why buses score so badly is that waiting time at bus stops is penalized under the model.free wifi in stations and on trains, better seating organization in rush hours, less delays etc… all that would help a lot i believe.it fascinates me that they think it’s ok to assign a monetary value to time saved by travellers – but then provide no explanation, reference or link to their model.so, they’re arguing that in order to compete with air travel, train travel has to compete on speed, and that this is the main defining factor.and they came up with a very good engineering solution, which was to spend six billion pounds building completely new tracks from london to the coast, and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.free, reliable, high-speed wi-fi, power points and table space would help a lot in this respect.after hs2 is built, travellers will save just 35 minutes.what you should in fact do is employ all of the world’s top male and female supermodels, pay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free chateau petrus for the entire duration of the journey.the problem should have been studied as a full policy analysis taking into account all other viable options, but in the hs2 case (as is this presentation), it was more done as a thing to tick off the list in order to justify the staggering expense.to top it off, let’s consider what kind of time-saving hs2 will give a journey from london to birmingham.besides, instead of trying to reducetotal travel time, we should start thinking about how to reduce dead time (i.e. time when you are unable to do anything useful).this is a huge sum considering the uk’s current financial situation.
