i had a very exciting evening in cafe de paris!
went to see danmingo the other night.
i loved it here good crowd exellent music funky house and r and b. lovely  staff great night out esp if you have a table!
try and get vip as you'll be able to sit and chat while the club fills up...also allows you to stay till 4am ;-) nice atmosphere, nice people!
i thought the prices were about average for a west end club, however i did find the v.i.p area a little crowded.
and it is only £10 to get in.
my favorite part was the really hot bartender from  argentina, he was very nice.
thank god i knew the promoters so i got free drinks in the vip room.
doenst pull in a good crowd either.
men that work there  were full of compliments towards me ( which made my bf jealous lol) and rest of  staff were fine!
music  wasnt too great either.
musically , along with big tunes at the moment, there was quality funky and electro house with a sprinkle of rnb so fantastic.
send to a friend simply enter the details above and this webpage will be sent.
went here last night with 2 male friends had a great night.
my friend was performing his football tricks (daniel magnus) and the crowd loved him and there was such a good atmosphere!
the music at cafe rocks!
my lasting memory will be when i asked for a drink and the barman replied "you get f all unless you say please".
you just want to whisper in their ear: 'you just work in a nightclub darling, cut the attitude'.
not a bad place, but as mentioned, if you get there too early then expect to hear the same songs a couple of times.

reviewed by peter |  london | 1st july 2005 we went saturday night, and this club is expensive for what it is, the  cocktails tasted more like juices and cost too much the music was ok, the  crowds were ok as well.
the major let downs are the drinks prices (normal for leicester sq though) and some of the people that get in- too many "gangsters" for somewhere that wants to appear classy; who lets people wearing white trainers into a club?
we met a promoter outside and got a good discount on the entry price and jumped the que!
haven't seen a band this good in a very long time!
not too rnb as that is getting sooo dull at the mo!
but the first 2 times were a lot better.
a strict door seems to keep the idiots out.
i went to cafe de paris for the third time last night, and my mates and i ended up going there because we always get vip
its so hard to get in..but once there..get some good cocktails and u are treated as a king, no doubts.

although i loved the decor the place is like a huge hotel and i felt lost half the time (maybe caused by alchohol!)
a strict door seems to keep the idiots  out.
we were treated to our own table and the staff were very friendly!
the drinks are a bit pricey but what do you expect in the west  end.
i ended up not going in vip at all as it was rubbish.

reviewed by farah |  midlands | 7th march 2007 still a great venue.
music was just amazing although, i agree with a lot of the people commenting, the drinks were way too expensive!
sat night there was very overrated, dissapointed with the music as well as the croud.
holding over 700 people, the venue contains three separate bars in addition to the mezzanine and main dance floor—the red bar, the blue bar and the fantasy rooms (vip area).
the drinks are a bit pricey but what do you expect in the west end.
there were too many people, and it was completly crowded, the dj must have played every song more than two times, vip had far too many people in there, an it is only small so it was sooo hot.
you get a feeling that you should be honoured to be there; but youre surrounded by 21 year old students!
the crowd is a better mix now and the atmosphere was excellent.
no guestlists needed usually so you can just go  there if you did not plan anything else.
loads of good looking girls and not too much attitude.
very friendly staff, strict door  policy but not a stupid one!
still a great venue.
the band was the best!
but  overall it was good!!
great place to be on saturday nights!!!
and the men there were horrible.

this pplace is really great, nothing else like it in london.
i really enjoyed cafe de paris, it had all of the right ingredients.

also, my friend bought two  doubles and coke, and it came to £18.
the podium dancers are great and the lighting is quite cool.

i think that comment sums the establishment up.
i will definately be going back i really enjoyed cafe de paris, it had all of the right ingredients.
i went to this club last friday - nice place, friendly doorstaff with no bad attitudes.
the cafe suffers from having a clientele that has probably got a minibus from southend for 'traceys hen night.
