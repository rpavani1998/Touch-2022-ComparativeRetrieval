march 2006 went cafe a lil while ago and i was in vip, drinks were way too expensive!
music was just amazing although, i agree with a lot of the people commenting, the drinks were way too expensive!
i enjoyed the excellent service on the vip table that was offered to me, the hosts were not only friendly but very good looking as well.
i ended up not going in vip at all as it was rubbish.
no guestlists needed usually so you can just go there if you did not plan anything else.
not too rnb as that is getting sooo dull at the mo!
mixed clientele good atmosphere.
reviewed by tinks | hertfordshire | 2nd november 2005 i went to cafe de paris for the third time last night, and my mates and i ended up going there because we always get vip and it is only £10 to get in.
the music was decent, and the place was set us very cool, i loved the staircase and blue room.
a fantastic venue, great atmosphere, great crowd, awesome decor.
went with the g/f was a brilliant nite, always enjoying going there love the set out however the downside is the music sometimes hardly enough rnb!!
holding over 700 people, the venue contains three separate bars in addition to the mezzanine and main dance floor—the red bar, the blue bar and the fantasy rooms (vip area).
so on the way in he ushered us past the queue of people ( who looked angry because they had to queue) and went inside.
the podium dancers are great and the lighting is quite cool.
i will definitely go back when i go back to london reviewed by kristin | orlando | 9th june 2005 music was good (bit of funky vocals), drinks were good and the people were great!
but overall had a good night and shall be returning, perhaps this time on a different night when the men weren't so sleazy....!
loads of good looking girls and not too much attitude.
loved the decor and the atmosphere, drinks a bit expensive but had a good night.

but on the whole a good nite out reviewed by michelle | london | 2nd may 2006 it was gud apart from the dance and house music please play moe rnb and dancehall eg sean paul and not " the song let the sunshine " it was really bad and didnt get me in the mood for dancing until i heard some dancehall sean paul and nina sky if you played less dance and house i garantee that the night will be a total sucess and even more people wud recommend cafe de paris.
proffessional staff, and not too many protentious people.
and the club is really swish.
my friend was performing his football tricks (daniel magnus) and the crowd loved him and there was such a good atmosphere!
reviewed by peter | london | 1st july 2005 we went saturday night, and this club is expensive for what it is, the cocktails tasted more like juices and cost too much the music was ok, the crowds were ok as well.
reviewed by teena x | london | 8th february 2006 went to the club a couple of fridays ago, thought it was really good.
top night,, pure chilled stuff i really enjoy cafe de paris, i've been a few times and love the place, it gets a little over crowded sometimes with rude looking guys.
sat night there was very overrated, dissapointed with the music as well as the croud.
i really enjoyed cafe de paris, it had all of the right ingredients.
i loved it here good crowd exellent music funky house and r and b. lovely staff great night out esp if you have a table!
musically , along with big tunes at the moment, there was quality funky and electro house with a sprinkle of rnb so fantastic.
its so hard to get in..but once there..get some good cocktails and u are treated as a king, no doubts.

went here last night with 2 male friends had a great night.
£15 entry cost on saturday nights- its probably only worth £10.

i was in the cafe de paris last sat and foud that the venue not only was a beautiful site to see but the atmosphere was of a extremely high standard.
had no problem getting in as we had put ourself on the guest list prior to going.
i would recommend this club to anyone who is looking for a sophisticated and fun night out.

try and get vip as you'll be able to sit and chat while the club fills up...also allows you to stay till 4am ;-) nice atmosphere, nice people!
i thought the prices were about average for a west end club, however i did find the v.i.p area a little crowded.

reviewed by sebastian | london | 7th december 2004 i dont like this club too much-its too big, and its too much space for dancing.
this pplace is really great, nothing else like it in london.
i thought the prices were about average for a west end club, however i did find the v.i.p area a little crowded.
there were too many people, and it was completly crowded, the dj must have played every song more than two times, vip had far too many people in there, an it is only small so it was sooo hot.
you just want to whisper in their ear: 'you just work in a nightclub darling, cut the attitude'.
we met a promoter outside and got a good discount on the entry price and jumped the que!
very friendly staff, strict door policy but not a stupid one!

thank god i knew the promoters so i got free drinks in the vip room.
the drinks are a bit pricey but what do you expect in the west end.
had no problem getting in as we had put ourself on the guest list prior to going.
the major let downs are the drinks prices (normal for leicester sq though) and some of the people that get in- too many "gangsters" for somewhere that wants to appear classy; who lets people wearing white trainers into a club?
with so much choice in central london now, we thought we'd try cafe de paris after not going for sometime.
we were treated to our own table and the staff were very friendly!

still a great venue.

although i loved the decor the place is like a huge hotel and i felt lost half the time (maybe caused by alchohol!)
the drinks are a bit pricey but what do you expect in the west end.
the food is actually really good, but again spoilt by such awful staff that seem to have an over inflated opinion of their own self importance.

the cafe suffers from having a clientele that has probably got a minibus from southend for 'tracey’s hen night’.
