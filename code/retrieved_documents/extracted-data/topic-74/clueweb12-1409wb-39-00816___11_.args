paris sounds incredibly romantic and appealing to anyone who enjoys open food markets, museums, and the big city charm of small spaces.in a sense, it’s more humane for the factory farm to slaughter their animals, because they are in pain and suffering constantly.as a libertarian, i believe that adults should be able to do whatever they want to do as long as it doesn’t harm other living creatures.they make a great breakfast or snack on the go, and are yummy warm or cold.overall, the scenes of real paris life are interesting and enjoyable, but the frequent scenes featuring bloody meat and elizabeth’s pity party really detract from the book.even if a person goes from eating meat at two meals a day to eating meat at one meal a day, that’s fewer animals being killed for food a year.poor elizabeth, living in paris with a man who loves her, cooking food for him every day, giving tours of the louvre.either you enjoy an easy way to make someone uncomfortable in a social situation or our choice makes you feel insecure for whatever reason.when it’s home-made, you can actually make sure it is quite healthy, including being low-fat and low-calorie.it also means i try to avoid being “militant” about anything and just hope that with the evidence i calmly present, people will change their minds.this memoir tells about her falling in love and the process of becoming an expat in france through the lens of food.this means that in what society sees as gray areas, i go with whatever side allows for more choice.in fact, i’m pleased that for the most part, people are genuinely nice about it and express concern in the restaurant or in their house that what i eat isn’t against my morals.i have no problem with omnivores who say they enjoy being at the top of the food chain, that we’re naturally predators so we may as well enjoy it, etc… they’ve decided what matters to them while acknowledging that this choice causes pain.gradually she falls for not just gwendal, but paris in general, especially the food.
