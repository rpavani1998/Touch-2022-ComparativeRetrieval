yes, a canon xti will produce great images, i have some to prove it, but it won’t last very long with the kind of travel photography that i do.
the scores of the d3x indicate it is the best of the lot.
as these high-end cameras become more complex, and quality-control becomes more and more of an issue, professionals will need to demand more from nikon and canon, and stop tolerating poor workmanship and performance.
you would love the image quality but the 3.9 mps may not be enough for wildlife shots.
but, in terms of image quality, in my opinion, it is as good as the nikon.
but, i suspect that there are lots of photographers like myself out in the real world who are going through the same process that i am, that are looking at real choices that are available now.
besides the cost will come down  substantially in the next six months.
the only beneficiary of that merry-go-round are camera dealers and used camera buyers.
one example is “black silicon” which is 100-500 times more sensitive to light that current silicon used in sensors.
but, in terms of image quality, in my opinion, it is as  good as the nikon.
particularly so if one travels as much as i do.
for the serious photographer, there comes a time when consideration of a new camera is on the mind.
the 5d mark ii offers the photographer a 21.1 megapixel camera with a  full-frame sensor and something entirely new, hd movies!
but, heavy means the camera can take better photos at lower shutter speeds.
if  you buy the d3x because you think it is superior to the mk iii, are you going  to sell it when the mk iv comes out, then sell the mk iv when the d4x (or d3y)  is available, ad nauseam?
so, cost is not always a  valid consideration.
canon says it has improved the weather sealing.
it produces fantastic images.
even if the camera is what canon says it is, i am still concerned about whether it will withstand the rigors i know i will put it through.
the only beneficiary of that merry-go-round are  camera dealers and used camera buyers.
only the best glass can be used with these cameras.
the d3x does not offer sensor cleaning.
course, i remember buying the 1ds for that four years ago, so perhaps it is not out of line.
for example: the canon 300 mm f/4 l is, see:   http://www.bill.lockharts.com/index.php/tag/canon-300mm-f4l-is the canon 100-400mm f/4.5.-5.6l, see:   http://www.bill.lockharts.com/index.php/tag/canon-100-400mm-f45-56l and the fabulous 200mm f/2.8l, see:   http://www.bill.lockharts.com/index.php/tag/canon-200mm-f28l btw, i have a 1ds mark ii with about 12,000 shutter releases for sale.
if he really means it, he should dump all his canon equipment, not even consider nikon, and immediately run out and buy a couple of mamiya rz67 pro iid bodies, a bunch of lenses, 2 leaf backs, and a bunch of car batteries.
that capability would simply change everything we do with a camera and offer up a new world of light.
but, one thing is for sure, i don’t envision that anytime soon i  would have the funds to jump into the medium format arena.
at first blush, the nikon d3x sounds like the answer, giving the photographer the option of shooting full-frame or a reduced sized shot at higher speeds.
what is good is that we do have some amazing options today.
the 1ds mark iii originally hit the market at around that amount as well.
with outstanding image quality, it is difficult to pass up, particularly if the price for it drops in the next six months, and likely it will when its replacement is announced.
like the nikon, it is a professional grade  camera.
course, the major consideration for me is that i own lots of canon l  glass.
the nikon d3x, the canon 1ds mark iii, and the canon 5d mark ii.
the second is build quality and durability.
a nice versitile  camera.
i look at it this way.
for me, the considerations involve whether  upgrading will improve the overall quality of what i do.
if i am at punda maria in south  africa and the temperature is hovering around 130 degrees f in the shade, what  camera do i want there?
at 24mp there is nothing out there, other than the sony alpha, that  offers this much resolution.
but, canon does not rate it as a professional grade camera.
a nice versitile camera.
full frame and partial frame at higher speeds.
the big issue for me is all the canon glass i own.
reply hi omar, when one reaches 21mp
one can only tell when we compare the  detailed shots taken by nikon d3x and canon 5dm2.
the first is weather sealing.
and frankly, i have no desire to lug such equipment around.
when one travels and when one enters into the real  world of nature photography, the affects of weather on equipment is  paramount.
what a revolution that will offer the photographer if it does mature.
why?  well, first, it tops the megapixel  race.
canon 5d mark ii –  first impressions (part three)→ choices: nikon d3x, canon 1ds iii, canon 5d ii posted on august 15,  2010 by bill
and yes, more megapixels produce  better resolution.
maybe not the all in one ideal.
after all, i have spent probably as much as the camera is  worth just getting to where i am about to shoot.
it  produces fantastic images.
so, maybe nikon isn’t too far off in the price.
course any new camera will have production issues.
i want something  that works when the light is there before me.
and frankly, i have  no desire to lug such equipment around.
the question is, which offers me an opportunity for better quality given my style of shooting and the types of images i like to capture?
i want a camera that will withstand what i will put it  through.
waiting for another six months is certainly an option for me.
heavy is something i detest, but heavy means solid and heavy means better photographs.
my quandary is wanting one camera that will do both, one that will withstand the rough treatment of travel and usage.
the question is, which offers me an opportunity for better  quality given my style of shooting and the types of images i like to  capture?
maybe even one  that offers two shooting modes.
i want a camera that will work when i need it  to work.
because canon will respond to the nikon d3x challenge with a mega mega megapixel camera.
professional cameras generally are built to withstand about 250,000 shutter releases, versus consumer cameras that might manage 100,000.
the equipment must stand up to extreme temperatures, rain,  snow, sleet, and heat.
this is why i am considering the 1ds mark iii.
the 5d mark ii offers the photographer a 21.1 megapixel camera with a full-frame sensor and something entirely new, hd movies!
but, the real consideration here is the price.
nikon’s announcement of this camera is receiving lots of interest by serious photographers.
reply paul harris says: january 21, 2010 at 11:41 am what nonsense!
i hate to even think about it, i yearn for a light-weight  camera that produces great images.
nikon’s announcement of this camera is receiving lots of interest by  serious photographers.
it just isn’t built well enough.

very high resolution and reduced resolution for images per second.
well bill, do you have the power of your convictions or were you  just leading us on?
i can’t up the frames per second by choosing a different format.
as to the 5d mark ii, we are reading some bad experiences with new owners.

if you buy the d3x because you think it is superior to the mk iii, are you going to sell it when the mk iv comes out, then sell the mk iv when the d4x (or d3y) is available, ad nauseam?
the real market for both the d3x and the 1ds mark iii, is not nature photographers, it is the professional photographer who does studio work, weddings, or the sports shooters and newspaper reporters who use the camera on a daily basis.
problem is, the movies i have seen are terrible, with jerky  motion.
five years ahead, we might very well be totally shocked at what is produced as technology gets better and better.
problem is, the movies i have seen are terrible, with jerky motion.
weather sealed and built like a small abrams tank.
of course if you are a nature tog and fond of fast af….don’t buy the 5d mkii!
so, i am considering three cameras for a possible purchase within the next six months.
canon has to make a pro replacement for the 1ds mark iii soon because the 5d mk ii has a better processor, same megapixels, etc.
i want something that works when the light is there before me.
that is interesting, it is in fact a major  consideration.
when one travels and when one enters into the real world of nature photography, the affects of weather on equipment is paramount.
and yes, more megapixels produce better resolution.
so, i think perhaps i will buy the canon 1ds mark iii.
i want a camera that will withstand what i will put it through.
but, it will cost one heck of a lot more than the 1ds mark iii which is available today.
it has a scratch on the selection wheel, but other than that it is in perfect condition.
so, a weather sealed camera with top notch construction is a major  consideration.
wow, it may offer those of us who do both landscapes and wildlife  photography a great resource.
it has one great advantage over the nikon d3x, and that is sensor cleaning.
its the best the pros can get.
in any case i’ll be  subscribing to your feed
it  has a scratch on the selection wheel, but other than that it is in perfect  condition.
it seems the d3x has its own set of problems that have been overlooked by reviewers that are afraid to honestly expose the flaws of this new camera.
nikon d3x is a clear winner .
but, the real consideration  here is the price.
so, a weather sealed camera with top notch construction is a major consideration.
very high  resolution and reduced resolution for images per second.
at this level, lens diffraction will be a major issue, especially for nature photography where one wants greater depth of field.
not all bad, but some issues are there.
two other factors are important to me.
all full frame cameras with no multipliers.
but, think a moment, i can buy two of the 5d mark iis for what i would pay  for either alternative!
both the mk iii and the d3x are good top of the line pro  cameras.
by the way, i purchased the 5d mk ii and it is a great camera.
reply january 21, 2010 at 12:15 pm hi paul, i have written lots of nonsense in my time, this isn’t the first or  the last time that i will.
any flaw in a lens will show.
i can buy a 1ds mark iii for about $1,500 less than the d3x.
that is interesting, it is in fact a major consideration.
so, let’s consider three cameras.
so, cost is not always a valid consideration.

the d3x does not offer sensor  cleaning.
what i have now produces good images when i take the time to think about what i am doing.

i can buy one for about $2,700, which is substantially  less than the d3x and the 1ds iii.
replacing my canon lenses with nikon lenses will push the price tag close to $20,000!
and is relatively cheap.
1ds mkiii against the d3x….d3x is 12 months late (imo) and therefore still overpriced compared to the 1ds mkiii, but perhaps we should wait for real world examples?

most consumer grade cameras won’t get close to that number.
best regards, billreply after sending my canon 20d back to canon 5 times; getting a brand new canon 1ds mkii with a bad sensor; and sending my canon 1ds mkiii back to canon for underexposing 2 full stops, i was ready to sell all my canon lenses and move back to nikon.
for those of us who do nature stuff, well, we have to hang our hats on what manufacturers offer to full-time photographers.
five years ago we could not have foreseen what the technology would produce in such a short time.
i hate having to spend hours and hours getting rid of dust spots on my images.
i just stumbled upon your blog and wanted to say that i have really enjoyed browsing your blog posts.

at 21.1 megapixels it is a tad shy of the nikon d3x offering, but it has  been around for a good while and the images it produces are equal, in my  opinon, to the new nikon offering.
