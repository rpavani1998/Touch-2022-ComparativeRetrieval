equipped with pre and post capture technology, nikon 1 cameras are the first interchangeable lens cameras that can start recording images before you fully press the shutter button, and continue after you’ve clicked.
sometimes all the hyperbole that modern advertising uses is self-defeating, as you imply.
built to bring incredible levels of speed, simplicity and enjoyment to the way you capture your world, these portable a-cil nikon 1 cameras offer a brand new shooting experience.

compatible with the nikon 1 v1, it can be rotated vertically  or horizontally, and a capture illuminator (led) on the front of the unit  provides extra light when using motion snapshot or smart photo selector in the  dark.
to be as fast as a nikon 1 camera, you need an engine that can handle speed,  and this newly developed processor is equipped with two powerful engines that  can process images at an incredible 600 megapixels a second.
