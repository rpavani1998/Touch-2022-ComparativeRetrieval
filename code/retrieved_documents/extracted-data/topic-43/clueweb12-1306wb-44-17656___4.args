in practice, try scanning and balancing a 35mm slide or negative so that it looks as clean and natural as the d100 equivalent.
nikon n70 35mm film slr, 24-120mm zoom mounted.
left side, top to bottom: lcd monitor display on/off, menu on/off, playback thumbnail control, image lock, and the enter button.
fortunately, the af and d-type lenses were the biggest part of that investment, and it is so nice to be able to move them to the d100!
in burst or bracket mode shooting, this buffer can still fill up fast with the largest formats such as tiff and raw!
as with all digital cameras today, the built-in computer is almost everything.
forced ccd speeds, such as the d100's custom h1 and h2 ranges at 3,200 and 6,400 iso equivalency, are subject to randomly spaced, brightly colored pixels.
although no digital camera is ideal for deep-space photography, the slr camera body can be attached directly to the back of many astronomy telescopes with a cheap adapter.
i found myself going back to the manual for simple things like setting film speed and yes, even rewinding and changing a roll of film.
side, d100, f1.4 50mm lens mounted.
i like working with this menu, in contrast to the sony dsc-s85's, in which it easy easy to change anything, but impossible to find it.
forced ccd speeds, such as the d100's custom h1 and h2 ranges at 3,200 and 6,400 iso equivalency, are subject to randomly spaced, brightly colored pixels.
this camera is everything a serious amateur photographer could want in a digital camera, and, yes, you can take your lenses with you -- if you stay in the nikon slr family of cameras, into which the d100 has made a dramatic entry.
the d100 has a usable iso range of 100-4,000, writes out 6.3 megapixel images sized in 9 jpg, 3 tif and one raw format.
my experience with the fully auto features of my nikon n70 35mm was a bit unnerving (see photos).
similarly, attempting to delete an image will give a warning first.
taken with 24-120mm zoom at full zoom, 1/1000 sec., f8.0, focal length 120mm.
i read all 17 pages at least twice, and finally saved to disk as complete web pages.
top left photo is older nikon n70 film camera, for comparison.
less obvious is the lack of a cumulative buildup of analog dust and lint flaws between camera, negative emulsion, developing and processing, and/or scanning.
because so much of the modern camera's function is entrusted to the computer module and programming controls, there is less to do on the mechanical level.
nobody else was; most shops had no idea when they would get even one display model.
it adds adventurous depth and clarity to the act of re-experiencing special moments and insights.
the word was the camera wasn't going to be widely available until "late summer".
fortunately, the af and d-type lenses were the biggest part of that investment, and it is so nice to be able to move them to the d100!
deep-space photographers will use film and very long time exposures (24 minutes to several hours) to capture faint objects such as nebulae and star clusters.
it's assumed most photographers already have the lenses they like using.
i love this 1.3 megapixel camera, which was state of the art in 1998 and still does an awesome job of cranking out perfect pictures almost every time.
these progress in size from 220k to 17.3mb at up to 24-bit color depth.
unlike "consumer" digitals, the d100 writes to a buffer which can hold up to 7 consecutive shots, so the d100 user does not perceive the baffling time delay that has spoiled many a digital action shot.
computer and navigation system: on the top right of the camera is a lcd readout panel displaying the most frequently referenced functions, such as exposure mode and sensitivity setting (iso), f-stop, shutter speed and number of shots remaining at the current picture size.
there's no way i can tell others that this camera is right for them, particularly when the initial purchase price is more than double that of popular high-end consumer models.
it isn't just that i don't fully trust fully automatic cameras, i don't understand the rationale behind many of the controls.
the owners manual documentation is unusually clear and well written.
command dial. 5 lcd display and programming buttons (discussed in article above).
though anybody can delight at the stunningly sharp, clear pictures, there are cameras on the market at less than half the price with great fixed optics, 4 to 6 megapixels, that are much easier to use and may even take more pleasingly balanced pictures in the hands of the average consumer.
for me, the move will be easy and complete.
but we should not forsake playing music or taking pictures because we could always do better with better equipment.
the included camera strap shows nikon intended for this camera to be serviceable and to present itself well.
user interface: no camera should win high marks for ergonomics if the user interface isn't logical, intuitive and consistent.
note the dc-260 was hardly able to resolve the telephone wire lines at all.
i'm delighted and relieved to say that i find the computer and user interface of the d100 to be (for the most part) well thought out and easy to navigate without constant reference to the manual.
because so much of the modern camera's function is entrusted to the computer module and programming controls, there is less to do on the mechanical level.
popping up the flash unit is simple and actually activates flash-fill in typical default setups -- what a concept!
the word was the camera wasn't going to be widely available until "late summer".
takes compact flash or ibm microdrive, not included.
the oversize camera grip shows well here and in the "top" photo.
i was never comfortable with the n70, which was not high-end; i much preferred the much older el2, which i nevertheless stopped using because guilt chained me to the newer investment.
with the d100, at last i will never be able to complain about the limitations of the equipment!
the number of pictures defaults to an "always-on" mode even when the camera is turned off.
lcd monitor with protective clear plastic snap-on overlay.
early on, i got that old familiar feeling that sooner or later i was going to own one.
i love manuals but loathe poorly designed documentation, so i have a reputation for rarely giving manuals the time of day.
i have never been a fan of scrolling lists that only show one value at a time, such as shutter speed or iso equivalent speed.
nikon d100 6.3 megapixel single lens reflex digital camera, with af nikkor 24-120 zoom attached.
this investment should last a lifetime, more likely so if you're already over 50.
if the operating system wasn't both powerful and easy to use, so that users could spend time with the work rather than with the manual, no machine, of whatever power and state of the art, could be worth the powder to blow itself up.
by august, ritz advertised a "1-2 week backorder" status, which, privately, they were admitting to customers was running 2-4 weeks.
it is the sharing of the jumbo prints around the living room, or the highly compressed email and web images, that brings photography alive.
in short, this camera will always have limited appeal to most consumers, even if prices come down to the level of 35mm film cameras, which is not likely to happen real soon now.
if you inadvertently select a setting that will reset the camera or reformat compactflash, such as switching to raw format, you will get a warning.
visible on right is lens release button, and focus mode selector: m, s or c for manual, single-servo auto focus (static), and continuous auto focus (moving subjects).
i was never comfortable with the n70, which was not high-end; i much preferred the much older el2, which i nevertheless stopped using because guilt chained me to the newer investment.
in the full image (obviously not reproduced here), i can read the "blockbuster video" and "direct sales floors" halfway across town.
domestic and foreign users alike will appreciate (but not equally so) that the d100 comes with two manuals.
if your subject is a mountain by the light of the rising quarter-moon, you could find and edit these pixels.
for the occasional really long night time exposure, i can always break out the n70 (better yet, the el-2) and do my time exposures manually.
the camera back panel buttons are mercifully brief.
i found myself going back to the manual for simple things like setting film speed and yes, even rewinding and changing a roll of film.
mounting and usage of the familiar nikkor lenses, and operations like servicing the battery pack and compactflash, are still simple.
the number of pictures defaults to an "always-on" mode even when the camera is turned off.
using the d100 i have used this d100 camera, fooled with it, and practiced with it for 6 days now.
i expect the d100 will take a little longer to amortize to this level, but i expect it will get a lot more use per year, and that it will still be taking great pictures in 10 and maybe 20 years.
the d100 makes a sound "like a real camera" because it is a real camera.
the lithium battery pack compartment cover is on the far side bottom, not really visible in this view.
equally useful is the ability to add screw-on filters (ultraviolet, polarizing, tinted and neutral) and close-up attachments.
this lens has appreciable heft, but the d100 balance still feels good.
the n70 on full auto was quite intimidating under anything less than full bright sunlight, and the control set was non-intuitive.
shot with f1.4 50mm lens, f9.0, 1/320, automatic, color space srgb.
owners manual: after i put a lens on the d100, charged and installed the battery, and inserted a 256mb compactflash (crucial, $99), the first thing i did is spend an hour with the d100 manual.
more significantly, the thoughtfulness of the camera design, and its ease and intuitiveness of use, is weaning me from the manual already.
in such cases it hardly matters what camera was used to compose the shots.
the d100 costs $1999, slightly more than the totals we paid for the kodak dc-260 when it came out in 1998, plus the cost of the sony dsc-s85 when we bought it in 2001.
in the end, the photographer with a stable of canon lenses will automatically choose the d60; the nikon buff will naturally choose the d100.
all control settings and options are available through the menu.
the optional command and sub-command wheels are intended to offer basic function changes without having to dive into the menu.
if your subject is a field of 10,000 stars of varying magnitudes and apparent colors, you could not.
front view, d100 with f1.4 50mm "normal" lens attached.
if you calculate the number of pixels potential in a scientist's 4x5 photographic plate, digital photography loses in the megapixels numbers game.
i'm delighted and relieved to say that i find the computer and user interface of the d100 to be (for the most part) well thought out and easy to navigate without constant reference to the manual.
standard nikon "hot flash" visible above viewfinder, for external strobes.
this is also true of many other machines that offer us at least the opportunity to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary.
i really appreciate the fact that the view screen or "monitor", and other windows and controls, are strategically placed so that i'm not constantly smudging them in an effort to operate or grip the camera.
i believe that nikon owners may not find a better time to make this move for quite some time, and that if they do move now, they will be surprised and delighted.
the moment is the important thing, and it lives forever, or, at least, so long as its record can be preserved.
the d100 costs $1999, slightly more than the totals we paid for the kodak dc-260 when it came out in 1998, plus the cost of the sony dsc-s85 when we bought it in 2001.

the joy of capturing the moment is much more than about the camera that makes it.
i can hardly wait to go for a drive and do some serious shooting.
i read all 17 pages at least twice, and finally saved to disk as complete web pages.

the d100 makes a sound "like a real camera" because it is a real camera.
domestic and foreign users alike will appreciate (but not equally so) that the d100 comes with two manuals.
i devoured the d100 manual and feel comfortable using it as a reference, always a great sign.
equally useful is the ability to add screw-on filters (ultraviolet, polarizing, tinted and neutral) and close-up attachments.
the dc100 payoff should come with higher resolutions and tiff (lossless) image capture, below.
most people would say that the dc260 image is "prettier", and in fact the kodak algorithms have a tendency to make things look prettier than they really are.
if the operating system wasn't both powerful and easy to use, so that users could spend time with the work rather than with the manual, no machine, of whatever power and state of the art, could be worth the powder to blow itself up.
processing time: in normal usage the d100 feels as responsive as a normal camera.
images: imported into photoshop 7.0, using the embedded color profiles from each camera.
if you aren't already a 35mm enthusiast, and don't like the jargon of f-stops, shutter speeds and iso ratings: the d100 is capable (like all digital cameras) of shooting fully automatic focus and exposure.
for some sophisticated slr users, the d100 might perhaps never fully replace their high-end 35mm cameras.
this camera is everything a serious amateur photographer could want in a digital camera, and, yes, you can take your lenses with you -- if you stay in the nikon slr family of cameras, into which the d100 has made a dramatic entry.
the ability to switch lenses, say from normal to telephoto, gives the slr much of its desired versatility.
some consumer digitals, like our sony s85, appear to play a recorded slr camera shutter sound as an aural cue that the picture actually has been snapped.
4-way nav button, focus area lock, trash (delete) button.
in practice, try scanning and balancing a 35mm slide or negative so that it looks as clean and natural as the d100 equivalent.
a good investment should still pay for itself over time, in performance and satisfaction.
the d100 panel is relatively uncluttered and easy to scan.
there's no way i can tell others that this camera is right for them, particularly when the initial purchase price is more than double that of popular high-end consumer models.
the ability to switch lenses, say from normal to telephoto, gives the slr much of its desired versatility.
lacking a more concrete test, it seems to me the d100 image is subjectively at least as good as the scanned35mm equivalent, clearer from edge to edge, and conspicuously free of lint and dust.
the extra leap to the complexity of pro and semi-pro cameras allows you, among other things, to turn all that "auto" stuff off when it gets in your way.
alternately, they go digital with special (relatively cheap) dedicated astronomy ccd plates that do not pixilate on long low-light exposures.
included: camera body, strap, en-el3 d100 lithium battery pack, external charger, protective caps and clear monitor cover, audio cable, usb cable, manual, and nikon view 5 browser and capture software.
you can see that tiff produces not only an image of much finer resolution (as you would expect for 17.3mb), but overall image quality is much sharper and color balance is much better, than the finest quality jpg.
the 17.3mb native tiff image size is the same size as the coolscan iv film scan.
computer and navigation system: on the top right of the camera is a lcd readout panel displaying the most frequently referenced functions, such as exposure mode and sensitivity setting (iso), f-stop, shutter speed and number of shots remaining at the current picture size.
it's assumed most photographers already have the lenses they like using.
i've always suspected that kodak engineered some sophisticated color balance and image enhancement algorithms into its images, for these images rarely benefit from the standard photoshop feature set, as do nikon slide scans and even the nikon d100 images i've shot so far.
the d100 has a usable iso range of 100-4,000, writes out 6.3 megapixel images sized in 9 jpg, 3 tif and one raw format.
ergonomics: as a full-size slr, the d100 is a hefty camera, particularly with a zoom lens, but the full wraparound grip, which also houses the battery pack, makes single-handed shooting easy (use two hands anyway, and use the camera strap!).
conclusion: i was able to write most of this from memory, with minimal reference to the camera and manual that are right behind me.
given the greatly uneven starting size and resolution from the two cameras, a detail portion from both images was blown up to 200% of starting size, at which point neither jpg looks particularly sharp.
the joy of capturing the moment is much more than about the camera that makes it.
images: imported into photoshop 7.0, using the embedded color profiles from each camera.
understanding what the "auto" features are actually doing is harder than just setting everything back to "manual".
the dc-260 took us four years to amortize its cost to below a buck a shot - we're up to 1075 shots on it, and it was our "main" camera until we bought the poor, unappreciated sony for phoenix.
as a single lens reflex (wysiwyg), a small mirror pops up out of the light path.

no user of the sony dsc-s85 will ever relate the automatic settings to either the old manual controls, or to the conventional pop-culture icons for sun, shade, fast moving, stationary, flash and so forth.
i couldn't be more excited about it, and of course i'm delighted.
as expected, native kodak color balance and contrast is somewhat more dramatic than the untouched d100 image, right.
if you calculate the number of pixels potential in a scientist's 4x5 photographic plate, digital photography loses in the megapixels numbers game.
in such cases it hardly matters what camera was used to compose the shots.
user interface: no camera should win high marks for ergonomics if the user interface isn't logical, intuitive and consistent.
shutter: the d100 uses the same thin blade shutter mechanism as other fine through-the-lens cameras.
many years ago, i used to observe that really good motorcycles were capable of delivering performance that most riders would never learn to handle proficiently.
if you inadvertently select a setting that will reset the camera or reformat compactflash, such as switching to raw format, you will get a warning.
popup flash is visible in front, top and side views, above nikon logo.

the obvious advantages of digital include instant results, zero processing costs after the initial investment, on-the-fly adjustment of iso sensitivity ("film speed") and image type size, no scanning or developing,instant inspection, edit and delete, flash memory storage and transferability to the personal computer, and a potentially huge "roll of film" to hold many pictures without changing compactflash storage cards.
for me, the move will be easy and complete.
photos to do a film-to-digital comparison properly, i would need to get some kodak 100 gold film for the n70 and wait for kodak processing.

i believe that nikon owners may not find a better time to make this move for quite some time, and that if they do move now, they will be surprised and delighted.
i expect the d100 will take a little longer to amortize to this level, but i expect it will get a lot more use per year, and that it will still be taking great pictures in 10 and maybe 20 years.
shutter: the d100 uses the same thin blade shutter mechanism as other fine through-the-lens cameras.
the optional command and sub-command wheels are intended to offer basic function changes without having to dive into the menu.
though anybody can delight at the stunningly sharp, clear pictures, there are cameras on the market at less than half the price with great fixed optics, 4 to 6 megapixels, that are much easier to use and may even take more pleasingly balanced pictures in the hands of the average consumer.
photos to do a film-to-digital comparison properly, i would need to get some kodak 100 gold film for the n70 and wait for kodak processing.
auto exposure/auto focus lock button.
once in a lifetime we are fortunate enough (or reckless enough) to buy that dream car, or the dream home, or ... the perfect camera.
it turns out that while the d100 feature set is much more advanced than my older n70 film slr, it is also much more logically organized, intuitively structured, and easier to understand.
an auto slr is quite a bit more complex than an auto consumer product.
in short, this camera will always have limited appeal to most consumers, even if prices come down to the level of 35mm film cameras, which is not likely to happen real soon now.
thanks to the thoughtful design of the d100, and the clearly written manual, i felt comfortable that i could perform all the basic operations in the manual without going back to the manual to remember how to do it.
camera ccd's, designed for daylight usage, generate "noise" for night shots, i.e., very long time exposures in very low light conditions.
you can still focus manually, and set shutter speed and f-stop manually, for special situations and when you want exposure-to-exposure consistency that "auto" can't deliver.
ergonomics: as a full-size slr, the d100 is a hefty camera, particularly with a zoom lens, but the full wraparound grip, which also houses the battery pack, makes single-handed shooting easy (use two hands anyway, and use the camera strap!).
jpg quality '9' high, downloadable.
the d100, so mounted, will take stunning pictures of "bright" night sky objects such as the moon and planets.
no, neither film nor digital slr bodies come with lenses at all (unless sold as a special "bundle").
barely visible on bottom is the standard tripod mount screw hole.
with the d100, at last i will never be able to complain about the limitations of the equipment!
if you aren't already a 35mm enthusiast, and don't like the jargon of f-stops, shutter speeds and iso ratings: the d100 is capable (like all digital cameras) of shooting fully automatic focus and exposure.
camera ccd's, designed for daylight usage, generate "noise" for night shots, i.e., very long time exposures in very low light conditions.
but we should not forsake playing music or taking pictures because we could always do better with better equipment.

the obvious advantages of digital include instant results, zero processing costs after the initial investment, on-the-fly adjustment of iso sensitivity ("film speed") and image type size, no scanning or developing,instant inspection, edit and delete, flash memory storage and transferability to the personal computer, and a potentially huge "roll of film" to hold many pictures without changing compactflash storage cards.
in a family with many different brands of digital camera in the same household, anybody can point and shoot, but it would be interesting to hear what happens when somebody else attempts to change a setting!
i've learned to decipher most of the n70 readout panel, which is tough.
it would be fun to do that, and i would like to see the results myself.
with smaller telescopes, this is the ideal for terrestrial photography for extreme magnification, distance, or really bright, sharp close-ups.

left side, top to bottom: lcd monitor display on/off, menu on/off, playback thumbnail control, image lock, and the enter button.
although no digital camera is ideal for deep-space photography, the slr camera body can be attached directly to the back of many astronomy telescopes with a cheap adapter.
similarly, attempting to delete an image will give a warning first.
by august, ritz advertised a "1-2 week backorder" status, which, privately, they were admitting to customers was running 2-4 weeks.
deep-space photographers will use film and very long time exposures (24 minutes to several hours) to capture faint objects such as nebulae and star clusters.
for fun, bearing in mind the disparity in cameras, we'll set up the tripod on the back balcony using "normal" lens settings and the highest jpg quality each camera is capable of producing.
as with all digital cameras today, the built-in computer is almost everything.
this camera is really a pleasure to use.
