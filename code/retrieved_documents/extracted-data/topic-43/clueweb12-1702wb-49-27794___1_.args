my photojournalistic style of shooting ensures candid, natural images that tell a unique romantic story – yours!although i have shot many different types of weddings in many different locations, i believe the secret to my success is that i shoot every wedding as though it were my own.because we shoot in raw to maximise quality, we face no colour variations between cameras.the camera and the lens mounted are the tools of my trade.when we shot film we shot in both small (35mm)  and medium (645, 6×6 and 6×7) format at the same wedding.when we shot film we shot in both small (35mm) and medium (645, 6×6 and 6×7) format at the same wedding.with regard to the 2 “big brands”: my nikons are much faster handling during an event and have a great flash system.for some people (lazy jpeg shooters) this causes huge problems with matching colour.otoh my canons while slower to use, have higher resolution, 1080p video mode, and some lenses i want to use not available from nikon.just as then, we use different camera for different requirements.you can follow any responses to this entry through therss 2.0 feed.this entry was posted on tuesday, september 14th, 2010 at 3:28 am and is filed underfor photographers.as one of my partners also has a mamiya with a phaseone back, we actually shoot 3 systems.as one of my partners also has a mamiya with a phaseone back, we actually  shoot 3 systems.leave a reply click here to cancel reply.
