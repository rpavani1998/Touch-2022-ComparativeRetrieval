this lens covers the same angle of view that a 29-88mm zoom would on a full frame camera, so it's useful for many types of photography including landscapes, group shots and portraits.all three cameras are capable of producing excellent image quality, so the choice should be mainly based on camera features.the main downside of enabling high iso noise reduction is that the camera can buffer fewer images when capturing in continuous mode.the image stabilized (is) system is a new low-cost version of canon's traditional is, but the performance is good and it can add up to three stops of stability, making handholding the lens in low light easier, despite the relatively slow maximum aperture.overall the xsi is an improvement over the xti, though more in terms of features than image quality, which is good in both cameras.it's also possible to use manual focus of course, and the lcd image can be magnified by 5x or 10x to assist in optimizing focus.up to iso 400 all three cameras give very clean images with little or no evidence of noise.the drawback of this mode is that it can be slow (focus may take several seconds) and it may not be as sensitive or accurate as the normal "quick" af mode using the dedicated phase detection af sensors.it gives an angle of view equivalent to an 88-400mm lens on a full frame 35mm camera.however, noise is still pretty well controlled, even at iso 1600 on the xsi and it's low enough that small to medium sized prints made from the images would be quite acceptable.these include a "vivid" mode which increases saturation for more vivid greens and blues, a noise reduction mode to lower image noise and three black and white modes (neutral, warm and cool).both the d40x and d80 have the option of an iso 3200 setting, which could be a consideration for those who do a lot of low light work.in this mode the image is continuously displayed on the lcd and the camera uses that image to find focus via a contrast sensing algorithm.even at f/5.6, the ef-s 55-250mm lens creates a nice out-of-focus background while still capturing detail and vivid color in the flower.the sony alpha a350, (compare prices) (review) offers a 14mp sensor, iso 3200 capability, an advanced live view system, a tiltable 2.7" lcd, sensor-shift stabilization built into the camera body and a 9-zone af system.
