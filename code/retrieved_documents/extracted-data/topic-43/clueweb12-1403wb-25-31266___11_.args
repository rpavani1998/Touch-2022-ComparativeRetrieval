the 640x480 non-hd definition is unexciting, the recorded sound is mediocre, and the optical zoom doesn’t work during recording and the image shows clouding in the shadows.you can move from one picture to another, zoom and move around within a picture, and play video files – though the sound quality from the built-in speaker is very limited.the nikon is a new-concept camera, and so it really shouldn't be put side by side with a rather orthodox canon model.the lens really lacks evenness, especially at wide-angle, with a fairly good centre but edges that are particularly fuzzy.when shooting raw files with the s90, adobe's lightroom 2.6 and the photoshop camera raw plug-in 5.6 will provide geometric distortion correction results to raw files similar to the native jpeg files and raw files processed by canon dpp.as far as the projector goes, despite the inevitable technical limitations, the camera delivers what it promises.for sensor sensitivity, nikon isn’t among the best.with the s1000pj, nikon is trying out a new concept: “your personal theater on the go” – a camera that lets you show your photos and video to your friends.so you can use it to control the s1000pj (including the zoom) remotely, which may be an interesting feature for tripod users.purple fringing is very visible at high contrast, even on medium-sized prints.handling with its picasso-style nose in the middle of its face and second eye above, the nikon s1000pj is instantly recognizable.the remote control that comes with the camera works in projector mode, of course, but also in snapshot mode.in telephoto, the contrast is never good, even in the center, and the purple fringing is no fainter.at the rear is a 2.7-inch 230,000 dpi lcd screen, with a highly visible weave and pronounced clouding in shadows.it’s an original solution that makes the coolpix s1000pj unique among the hundred or so cameras released in 2009.
