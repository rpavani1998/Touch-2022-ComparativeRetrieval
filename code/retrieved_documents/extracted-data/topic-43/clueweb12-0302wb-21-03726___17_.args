for those looking to reel off bursts of images in continuous shooting mode, the d7000 offers a pleasing 6fps.considered in the context against the nikon d300s's 7fps, and side by side to the canon 60d's 5.3fps, this is a well-specified offering that will prove tempting to those enthusiasts looking for speed as well as resolution and all-round capability.the rear of the camera has a fixed 3in, 920k-dot lcd screen and a viewfinder sat above this gives a full 100% field-of-view to ensure that exactly what you frame by eye is what you capture.it's not just still images where the nikon d7000 comes well equipped either: the ability to capture full hd 1080p video at 24 frames per second sees off much of the competition thanks to its progressive capture.paired up with the expeed 2 image processing engine, the d7000 also boasts nikon's latest hardware for speedy processing and the capability to expand the already well-specified iso 100-6400 sensitivity to a top-end hi2 setting - the equivalent of iso 25,600.indeed, to dispel the myth of it being a d90 replacement, it's worth pointing out that both cameras will continue to run in the current nikon range for the time being and the gap between one and the next is fairly considerable.the nikon d7000 adopts a new 16.2-megapixel cmos sensor, suggesting that the megapixel count for dslr cameras is clearly still on the rise.they should give it a 5 shot hdr capability and the ability to shoot hd video at 30fps.the nikon d7000 is keen to stand apart from the older nikon range as an all-new camera.the d7000 is absolutely the best aps-c dslr, and the 18-105mm kit lens is a joy to use.to store your images there are twin sd card slots that can be utilised simultaneously or user-defined to operate in an overflow or stills/video format.yes, it's a phenomenal camera, in my opinion priced lower than what you'd expect.the 3mm of base height and the connecting screw which goes into the base of the d7000 secures it fine and the rubber protects the camera and forms additional grip.ipc media limited, owner of whatdigitalcamera.co.uk, will collect your personal information solely to process your request.it's still a disappointing camera given what nikon could have done for the price.
