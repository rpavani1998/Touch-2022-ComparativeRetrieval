i know just what jeff means when he writes about how, even though he stopped photographing some years ago, photography “never really lets you go.”
i took a half-dozen garden prints to our first meeting and encouraged her to tell me how they could be improved.
now we’re a couple of ex-photographers who spend most of our time writing (though we both include photographs in our weblogs).
as a codicil, the author of a spanish web site refers to an old arab fable i’d not encountered before: a young caliph asked the great vizier how he could tell if a poem was good or bad.
and i was already fragile, since i’d placed myself in the most extreme situation i could imagine, other than war—the point at which life begins and is immediately under threat.
since i hardly disagree with either loren’s or jeff’s positions, perhaps this argument is taking place along two parallel paths.
and i was so pleased to be informed of this that i ran twenty red lights in his honor
the second major explanation for the culture wars is that they  basically have been about politics, set off when ’60s radicals took their  battles from the streets into university departments.
through her efforts and szarkowski’s, atget’s reputation was secured.

i knew i was outnumbered when one of my brightest students recounted how dr so-and-so from the art theory department had told her that feelings were a bourgeois illusion, that she should work to embed in her photographs references to key theorists.
i feel much better dealing with something i’m comfortable with.
i was so taken by this photograph that i think i may have said to my friend gerrit fokkema: “i will never, ever take a picture without flash again.”
the use of two or three bulbs, synchronized to flash together as the shutter was released, could produce a reasonable simulation of normal interior light.
i knew i was  outnumbered when one of my brightest students recounted
measuring 92.6 x 71.0 x 27.0 mm (3.65 x 2.8 x 1 in), the dsc-f77 has about  the same dimensions as the credit card sizedcasio exilim ex-s2 that was  previously at the top of my list (admittedly the sony camera is significantly  thicker but it’s still a light, pocketable camera).
in other words, i am not trying to prove anything.
but the reviews all had a consistent theme: innovative design, marvellously compact for its feature set, disappointing image quality.
chapter 10 opens: men who pursue a multitude of women fit neatly into two categories.
they’d imagined that  photography consisted of re-photographing the photographs they’d seen in  books and magazines.
we drafted a flyer and posted it on all  the notice boards in the department.
but, taken together, they reveal a number of problems: there is no easy way to turn the lcd screen on and off the 4-way selector switch on the back is too small to be operated easily  with a finger tip the power button and the shutter release are so close together that  it’s easy to turn the camera off when you try to take a picture.
according to the accepted formula the outside landscape should be about twice as bright as the interior: otherwise the images seen through the windows would look like pictures on the wall.
i’d photographed, and the dozen or so photographers whose work i’d loved and studied for nearly twenty years.
looking back, i’m astonished that i got away with the subterfuge.
it’s as though curators,  desperate to include some women from that period in the documentary pantheon,  had to settle for work which, had it been done by a man, would have been  regarded as competent but undistinguished.
i like the idea of doing it in public; it will be like having advance reviewers.

in the case of the picture opposite, the photographer evidently miscalculated a little, but the picture is surely more interesting as it is than it would be if naturalistically correct.
rather, i saw the postmodernist position not as a personal affront but as  rigid, unimaginative, and inappropriate for young students with a relatively  constrained view of what could be possible in life and in art.
all of us, even the best-mannered of us, occasionally point, and it must be true that some of us point to more interesting facts, events, circumstances, and configurations than others.

i always considered myself well-informed about  documentary photography in 30s america
i hadn’t figured out exactly what i was going to  do.
i picked a photograph from the silk porfolio, to honor burningbird’s  insightful review of w.g. sebald’s the rings of saturn:
the little towns, the county seats, house by house white-painted and elaborately sawn among their heavy and dark-lighted leaves, in the spaced protections of their mineral light they stand so prim, so voided, so undefended upon starlight, that it is inconceivable to despise or to scorn a white man, an owner of land; even in birmingham, mile on mile, save for the sudden frightful streaming, almost instantly diminished and silent, of a closed black car, and save stone lonesome sinister heelbeats, that show never a face and enter, soon, a frame door flush with the pavement, and ascend the immediate lightless staircase, mile on mile, stone, stone, smooth charted streams of stone, the streets under their lifted lamps lie void before eternity.
i was so taken by the “honeymoon” photograph (at left) that i tracked down a copy of the japan book viaabebooks.com and just received an email from the merchant to say that they’ll ship it to me today.
i’ll check one out the next time i’m near a camera store.

photography was my first choice, but specifically, what?
although there’s no optical viewfinder, it uses aaa batteries and memory sticks (of which i already have three).
it contains the best of agee’s magnificent prose, as well as jarring passages of adolescent self-indulgence, self-pity, and pretension.
however, little rock must be growing faster.
like jeff, i was captivated by the intellectual challenge of transforming chaotic three-dimensional space into a cohesive flat plane.
better still, i might have continued to teach happily at  the university instead of resigning my tenured position, splitting up with the  lovely woman i’d been seeing for a couple of years, and abandoning  photography, thus diving headlong into a midlife crisis.
over the sixteen week semester, i’d show 21 photographers (11 whose work i loved, and 10 whose work i thought was important but didn’t much like at all).
i approached photography much the same way, experimenting with everything except fabricated tableaus.
why so much less so in english?
szarkowski writes in the accompanying text: bourke-while had an excellent sense of simple, poster-like design, and a sophisticated photographic technique, both perhaps the legacy of her apprenticeship in the demanding field of industrial reportage.

atget died in paris in 1927, having spent the previous thirty years assembling a comprehensive catalog of french architecture, landscape, and everyday life.
krupnick argues that “the role of moral tutor in the united states  has fallen to professors of english nearly as much as to the clergy” and  i may well have (unconsciously) taken on that role, a photographic variant of  krupnick’s “archetypal english-department academic,” who, in contrast to academics in other fields, is involved in a quest to know  himself or herself and arrive at a more intimate relationship with the good,  the true, and the real.
although this bore little resemblance  to my original proposal, i wasn’t troubled, since i’d always  believed that art can’t be made to a formula but invariably takes on a  life of its own, that it is possible to exert a fine degree of control over a  project without necessarily knowing where one is headed.

when you press the  shutter release, the camera finds focus and the shutter closes (the image then  freezes on the lcd screen), then the shutter is released.
and for many years all my pictures, whether taken indoors or outside, used flash to balance the illumination and flatten the picture plane, just as margaret bourke-white taught me.
the viewfinder showed a fraction less but i loved the square frame, the 2¼ negative, the solidthwump of the shutter and mirror, and—above all—the sense of control.
i’ve been to both: canberra many times and bakersfield just once, in the late eighties, during my mid-life crisis, driving from san francisco to las vegas via death valley with a girlfriend little more than half my age.
photography was endlessly fascinating: the perfect amalgam of art and science.
looking at  photographs, i nearly fell over, captivated by the way that bourke-white  had (perhaps accidentally) achieved a perfect balance between the interior  flash and the external daylight, pulling everything into a single plane.
the two kindly old people sit in a room that is hermetically sealed with illusions.

sturgeon says: sturgeon’s law originally was “nothing is always absolutely  so.”
but i was interested enough to track down some  detailed appraisals of the casio camera—ray’s weblog post is merely  a recommendation from a satisfied owner, not a review that balances the  camera’s strong points with its shortcomings.
the plow handles are wet, and the rails and the frogplates and the weeds between the ties: and not even the hurryings and hoarse sorrows of a distant train, on other roads, is heard.
this can take up to a  second and a half (less if you prefocus, but if the subject then moves you  can’t be sure that you’ve focused accurately).
“formalist in method and traditionalist in ideology” perfectly describes the way i chose to teach photography.
year after year of trying to make sense, when really all i needed to do was let go and let sense and mystery find me.
permalink i imagine my “overdetermined revulsion” (as akma might put it) for architects results from never having met one i liked.
despite my misgivings, i may succumb to its  obvious appeal.
i’ve always  thought that margaret bourke-white and dorothea lange are monumentally  overrated—the former melodramatic, the latter sentimental, both their  reputations inflated by virtue of their sex.
so the charade proceeded.
the roads lie there, with nothing to use them.
most probably i had exhausted my reserves of love and compassion.
finally, at the beginning of a new school year, i suggested to the other instructors a strategy for addressing the problem.
the  photographs they made were marvellous.
what a marvellous ambition.
you see, in a few weeks i have to start writing a a book.
walt whitman wasn’t part of the curriculum at the parochial high school i attended in sydney a long time ago.
the photographs they made were marvellous.
strongly recommended.
whenever dorothea salo writes about graduate school, i’m reminded of the university where i taught photography and managed to complete an ma in visual arts.
my supervisor never commented on the “real work” though i heard from reliable sources that she hated it.
i feel much better dealing with something  i’m comfortable with.
according to the accepted  formula the outside landscape should be about twice as bright as the interior:  otherwise the images seen through the windows would look like pictures on the  wall.
it’s impossible to shoot  fluidly with anything but a digital slr (where the image is deflected by the  mirror through the reflex prism to the viewfinder).
but, once fate or destiny put me under the invidious control of someone who lacked sympathy for the work i needed to make, i had no alternative but to marshall the resources necessary to outmaneuver her.
jeff’s scattered other pictures though his blog over the past week: his own (brak’n’tune, bakersfield, california 1990ish and california city, california, 1989) plus images by lee friedlander (boston 1985 ), bill owens ( “we’d rather play games than watch tv”— suburbia 1973), and lewis baltz (from new industrial parks near irvine, california).
i realized that this new medium combined three of my passions: images, writing, and movies.
the list  was small at first, but it’s been expanded a bit with a few books that i  wasn’t aware of until now.
or, at least it would be funny if you’d ever been to bakersfield.
it read: for this semester, the following subjects are declared off-limits to first-year photography students: - closeups of bark on tree trunks - shadows cast by sunlight streaming though a blind - grizzled old men with silvery whiskers - coils of wet rope on sand - toddlers with ice cream smeared on their faces - nudes - grainy pictures printed on high contrast paper - portraits in which the subject stares at the camera - slow exposures of water running over rocks - unmade beds these subjects have been photographed so much over the past few years that they are exhausted and in need of a holiday.
after a few false starts, i settled on a project—documenting everyday life in a neonatal intensive care ward.
perhaps i had come up hard against the midlife crisis and this activity that had absorbed most of my waking attention gradually became meaningless to me.
no matter how much i dislike margaret bourke-white, she took one photograph
i’m selfishly waiting for jeff ward to start writing his book online.
just as jeff suggested, it’s a real find: beautifully constructed photographs of everyday life in postwar japan in fourteen individual portfolios.
i’ve been composing all manner of texts, excepting fiction.
as ray puts it: the resolution is perfectly fine for on-screen viewing, it has a great flash, it has ample capacity when used with a 128mb memory card, it beats out even the blackberry in terms of its battery life (weeks), and best of all, it boots and is ready to snap a picture in sub-one-second.
the ex-s1 is a 1-megapixel camera in a stainless steel body that’s about the same dimensions as a credit card and only half an inch thick.
now there are fewer clashes within cutting-edge english departments, because nearly everyone is a theorist or cultural-studies specialist.
we turned a corner and there it was, still recognizable from the photographswalker evans made there in the summer of 1936.
the course is “extended topics in nonfiction” and the quantity of writing involved will be massive.
jeff ward learned to write because he wanted to talk online about the pictures he was making.
i  resigned and started working in multimedia and then web development, not unlike  mark krupnick, who jumped ship to teach religious studies.
the victors don’t always present a pretty picture.
the disappointment that propels them from woman to woman gives their inconstancy a kind of romantic excuse, so that many sentimental women are touched by their unbridled philandering.

but, taken together, they reveal a number of problems: this could be a perfect example of the old adage: don’t buy the first model of anything, wait until they get it right the second time around.
i was so taken by this photograph that i think i may have said to my friend  gerrit fokkema: “i will never, ever take a picture without flash  again.”
my reply was always the same: “photograph what you love or what you  hate, what inspires or terrifies you, what you yearn for or seek to  understand.”
i realize now how i imposed my prejudices on the students but at least  they were clearly stated.
in what must have been an accidental irony, a  malicious joke, or a deliberate attempt to bring me under control, i was  assigned the “supervisor from hell”: an up-and-coming young  marxist-feminist with a phd in post-structuralist art theory.

out of the hundreds of finished 11 x 14 color prints from my various false  starts and the thousands of unprinted negatives, i picked one failed project:  pictures of suburban gardens, artfully lit with a mix of ambient daylight and  fill-in flash, which i knew she would like—precisely because their  emptiness and sterility had been the catalyst for my venturing into the  intensive care ward.
eventually, once i’d chosen the prints with the help of  some photographer friends and written the captions with the assistance of one  of the nurses in the ward, i piled all the framed prints into my van one sunday  morning and headed off to the gallery.
most of all i loved the idea that pictures could touch people’s hearts and change their lives.
though i started out with jeff’s and loren’s sentimentality posts in the back of my mind, the teaching experience pushed to the foreground.
sometimes i wonder why the other  manufacturers bother.
not surprisingly this was anathema to the theorists and i was frequently  attacked for holding an idealist or transcendentalist position.
the picture thatjeff reproduced from  bristol’s korea book is terrific too—though i prefer the  unashamedly “staged” quality of the japanese photograph.
and i would quote lisette model’s famous dictum: the camera is an instrument of detection.. we photograph what we know and  what we don’t know… when i point my camera at something i am  asking a question and the photograph is sometimes an answer…
bourke-while became  very skillful at this technique, which required especially delicate calculation  when the level of the interior flash had to be balanced against the level of  natural light visible through a room’s windows.

so, when dorothea attacks academia and jeff defends it, it seems to me that  they are each describing different aspects of the same institution, since  universities are just as subject to sturgeon’s law (“ninety percent  of everything is crud”) as every other area of human endeavor.
model, levitt, and arbus rated a class each.
the size impressed me immediately—one disadvantage of the sony is  that it’s just too big to take with meeverywhere.
nor was his work appreciated by his fellow countrymen.
but i still want to address jeff ward’s two long posts about  sentiment, feeling, and sentimentality.
this can take up to a second and a half (less if you prefocus, but if the subject then moves you can’t be sure that you’ve focused accurately).
what i found out was— the harder you look, the less likely you are to find it.
a few years ago i visited nagasaki.
“you’ll  only be wrong one time in a hundred”.
every day in the hospital i experienced moments of unimaginable happiness as well as periods of the deepest distress.
and if loren found himself “a little surprised by [his] own actions  in defending the word” and by being labeled a  “sentimentalist,” i can only wonder at the irony of my newfound  guise as the scrooge of blogaria, denigrator of human feeling and thoroughly  unsentimental modernist.
multimedia metamorphosed into cd-rom and then the web.
i’m intensely curious to see what loren, jeff,and joe think of mark krupnick’s essay.
in the book, sabina (tomas’s mistress) encourages tereza (his wife) to become a photographer, lending her “three or four monographs of famous photographers” and explaining “what made each of the photographs interesting.”
either way, if you’re successful, the end result is the same: slightly less crud, though i doubt—given our moral and intellectual frailty—that we’ll ever radically alter sturgeon’s ratio of 90:10.
and, that though they may not look like journalism, they sure as hell feel like art.
the shutter lag isn’t appreciable, i can imagine taking it  with me everywhere, and the 2-megapixel resolution is a lot more appealing.
i don’t know whether the system was particularly slack in  those days but when i commenced the ma the emphasis was firmly on art practice:  my obligations were to make photographs, write regular progress reports, meet  occasionally with a supervisor, and present the finished work in a gallery  where it would be judged by independent assessors.
it is this revelation that has now become known as sturgeon’s law.
the other thing was known as “sturgeon’s revelation.”
(though, if they didn’t, it wouldn’t be capitalism.)
in first year it’s common for photo students to try all kinds of wacky “techniques” as they regurgitate every hackneyed picture they’ve ever seen.
many of the photographs he took in alabama for the farm security administration were reproduced at the beginning oflet

i know i yearned for those photographic values which started with walker evans and finished with robert frank and had fallen into disrepute.
he was the first to teach me how, by carefully balancing interior and exterior illumination, you could totally flatten three-dimensional space.
just works, just right.
so much hope, longing, sadness, optimism, and desperation packed into every frame.
this inability to be disappointed has something scandalous about it.

i used also to loathe post-modernists and post-structuralists, for the way  they ripped the heart out of art practice, taking something i loved almost as  much as life itself, and trampling it into a noxious slurry concocted from  fear, ambition, hatred, french theory, and pc claptrap mixed with generous  portions of their own shit, piss, and vomit.
it’s a story in which there are no winners, only losers.
krupnick argues that “the role of moral tutor in the united states has fallen to professors of english nearly as much as to the clergy” and i may well have (unconsciously) taken on that role, a photographic variant of krupnick’s “archetypal english-department academic,” who, in contrast to academics in other fields, is involved in a quest to know himself or herself and arrive at a more intimate relationship with the good, the true, and the real.

what makes the photo booth pictures (formally) interesting is that they are framed as mirror images, except that the women have changed places so that each appears in the foreground of one photo and the background of another.

when you press the shutter release, the camera finds focus and the shutter closes (the image then freezes on the lcd screen), then the shutter is released.
i’d photographed, and the dozen or so photographers  whose work
we held two openings: one for the parents of the babies i’d photographed and the hospital staff, another for the usual art crowd.
it is novel in its arrangement, but not in its themes.
more importantly, the combination of four megapixels and a carl zeiss lens ensures that the sony’s image quality will eat that of the casio, or the minolta dimage x. trust sony.
it is composed of  the song of others; there is no choice in this.
the real interest is, however, in the pair rather than the single images; in the juxtaposition of two portraits of two women, happily mugging for a camera without an operator, as it records a tiny sliver of “the endless variety of the objective female world.”
it has  a fixed focus 5.6mm/f2.5 lens (equivalent to 37mm on 35mm camera).
i’ll check one out the next  time i’m near a camera store.
i loved the fact that it was difficult and i could do it.
that influenced my own picture-making enormously: margaret bourke-white: henlein’s parents, reichenau, sudeten section of czechoslovakia, 1938
it’s hardly surprising that i’ve constructed myself as the  (flawed) hero of this narrative.
then i stopped photographing.
the obsession of the latter is epic, and women see nothing the least bit touching in it: the man projects no subjective ideal on women, and since everything interests him, nothing can disappoint him.
yet my only concern was that photography students use their cameras to engage their world with passion and commitment—for me, photography was a primarily a method for exploring ideas and emotions.
now that does make for an interesting picture.
i realized recently that i always did.
it’s as though curators, desperate to include some women from that period in the documentary pantheon, had to settle for work which, had it been done by a man, would have been regarded as competent but undistinguished.
rolls right off the tongue, eh?
all i know is this: at that time, she was absolutely the wrong supervisor.
references to thomas browne’s father being a silk merchant; the  purple piece of silk in the urn of patroculus; the silken ropes given to  hsien-feng’s viceroys so that they may hang themselves, an act of  benevolence as their sentence decreed that they …be dismembered and  sliced into slices.

permalink | comments (6) tuesday 20 august 2002 horace bristol’s vision thanks to jeff ward for alerting me to horace bristol’s japan (a “folio of 14-16 page pamphlets bound together in a wrap-around case  with bone closures”).
it’s an absolutely remarkable photograph: about picture-making (look at all the pictures within the picture, including the windows, as szarkowski points out below); about generations (the portrait of—probably—henlein’s grandfather on the wall behind his father and that of his grandmother on the wall behind his mother, reflected in the mirror); and about history (what will become of them when the nazis arrive?
both are generally enthusiastic: about the camera’s tiny size, its acceptable (not great) image quality, and range of manual functions.
but i’ve ended up researching an idea.
“formalist in method and traditionalist in ideology” perfectly  describes the way i chose to teach photography.
first, starting with the invasion of french poststructuralism in the 1960s, advanced literary interpretation changed from being formalist in method and traditionalist in ideology to a brand of french theory whose major distinguishing characteristic seemed to be that it required you to spend more time reading the theorists than reading the canonical texts of western literature.
i’d bring a batch of “new pictures” for her to critique whilst i poured all my time, energy, and passion into photographing at the hospital.
certainly, mick jagger and keith richards never wrote a song that mentioned australia’s capital city: i was driving home early sunday morning through bakersfield listening to gospel music on the colored radio station and the preacher said, “you know you always have the lord by your side”
i think i’ll hold back to see how jeff  approaches the activity but ever since he broached the subject my sleeping  patterns have been shot to pieces too.
but i hadn’t heard of bristol and certainly didn’t know that he had collaborated with john steinbeck; nor was i aware of his japan and korea photographs.
in other  words, i am not trying to prove anything.
doc’s essay is titled, it’s the writing, geniuses.
our attention was directed instead towards the english poets and a token australian or two.
i enjoyed sloshing around with chemicals, the solitude of the darkroom, the beauty and precision of expensive cameras, the physicality of taking pictures (requiring a kind of athletic grace more akin to sports than making art).
finally,  at the beginning of a new school year, i suggested to the other instructors a  strategy for addressing the problem.
the first reference i can find in his oeuve appears in the march 1958 issue ofventure science fiction, where he wrote: i repeat sturgeon’s revelation, which was wrung out of me after twenty years of wearying defense of science fiction against attacks of people who used the worst examples of the field for ammunition, and whose conclusion was that ninety percent of sf is crud.
i always loved that song, though not because of the reference to bakersfield.
if the casio had a resolution of two megapixels instead of one, i’d buy it immediately.
an hour of lies a month was  inconsequential compared with the truth i encountered every day in the ward.
how dr so-and-so from  the art theory department had told her that feelings were a bourgeois illusion,  that she should work to embed in her photographs references to key theorists.
in his preface to the aperture monograph on walker evans, lloyd fonvielle wrote: the text is an extended meditation on morality, perception, the limits of language, and the deceptions of art, all unified by elaborate descriptions of rural poverty executed with surgical precision and lyric genius.
i knew instinctively that my project would be anathema, that her enervated theorizing applied to the raw emotion of my pictures could only harm me and the work.
the revelation: ninety percent of everything is crud.
or have they already taken over?).
it was not a sudden decision but rather a feeling that built up over the course of a year.
“always assume it is bad”, he was told.
i’m convinced the best blogs owe much of their power to such an art of graceful pointing.
thank you jesus, thank you lord.
we expect to see them back,  refreshed and enthusiastic, in six months time.
either way, if you’re  successful, the end result is the same: slightly less crud, though i  doubt—given our moral and intellectual frailty—that we’ll  ever radically alter sturgeon’s ratio of 90:10.
corollary 2: the best science fiction is as good as the best fiction in any field.”
their moralism strikes me as being at odds with their obsession with intradepartmental power plays and their rapt attention to new fashions in criticism and whatever will advance their careers.
the second major explanation for the culture wars is that they basically have been about politics, set off when ’60s radicals took their battles from the streets into university departments.
i used also to loathe post-modernists and post-structuralists, for the way they ripped the heart out of art practice, taking something i loved almost as much as life itself, and trampling it into a noxious slurry concocted from fear, ambition, hatred, french theory, and pc claptrap mixed with generous portions of their own shit, piss, and vomit.
the fixed focus design of the ex-s1 virtually eliminates shutter lag since  there’s no focusing to be done: everything is always in focus from 1  meter to infinity.
whenever dorothea salo writes about graduate school, i’m reminded of  the university where i taught photography and managed to complete an ma in  visual arts.
“adolescent self-indulgence, self-pity, and pretension”—sounds just like a weblog.
there was no way i could expose their experience or mine to any “theoretical analysis.”
is it only because the  personifications—of wind, sun, moon—are so often cliches, or is  there some further deflection of reality taking place?
as i’ve writtenin another post: some viewers thought my photographs were intrusive, that i had exploited vulnerable people at a desperately unhappy time in their lives.
experimenting with combinations of words and images, just trying to see what i can make work.
after a few false starts, i settled on a project—documenting everyday  life in a neonatal intensive care ward.
so, the capitol of that continent is smaller than bakersfield?
about 50% more expensive than the casio, the dimage x makes a great first impression.
permalink | comments (10) horace bristol, japan, 1949:
i don’t suppose a half a million people qualify as a small town.
the ex-s2 is due to ship in the us on september 17.
i resigned and started working in multimedia and then web development, not unlike mark krupnick, who jumped ship to teach religious studies.
and i became close to  people.
in that time, he exposed perhaps ten thousand glass negatives—as szarkowski writes in another essay, atget “was not progressive, but worked patiently with techniques that were obsolescent when he adopted them, and very nearly anachronistic by the time of his death.”
us now praise famous men, the book that he and james agee produced whenfortune declined to publish their collaboration as a magazine article.
the 2000 figure is 548,000.
nevertheless, i remain interested: the tiny size and no shutter lag make it  an ideal point-and-shoot camera while the 1-megapixel (960x1280) image is more  than sufficient for web display, asjeff’s image gallery proves (steve,  inexplicably, took most of his gallery pictures at the interpolated 1200x1600
when i taught photography, the photographs taken by first year students were—with very few exceptions—sentimental clichés.
not surprisingly this was anathema to the theorists and i was frequently attacked for holding an idealist or transcendentalist position.
but  the reviews all had a consistent theme: innovative design, marvellously compact  for its feature set, disappointing image quality.
jeff gets the sounds of camera shutters just right: “the near-silentfftt of a leica or rollei to the loud whap of a mamiya rb-67” and theclunk of the nikon f series.
more importantly, the combination of four megapixels and a carl zeiss lens  ensures that the sony’s image quality will eat that of the casio, or the minolta dimage x. trust sony.
i had my doubts about 1-megapixel (the dsc-s70 is a 3-megapixel camera with a tack-sharp zeiss lens)
whereas joe pointed out—and i picked up on—the connection between sentimentality and brutality in warblogging posts, loren and jeff argued for sentimentality as a valid human response to lived experience (jeff would use sentiment as a synonym for feeling).
it might be worth a look when it ships.
although i hold bourke-white and lange in low regard, i adore the work of their near contemporaries lisette model and helen levitt.
when i taught photography, the photographs taken by first year students  were—with very few exceptions—sentimental clichés.
corollary 1: the existence of immense quantities of trash in science  fiction is admitted and it is regrettable; but it is no more unnatural than the  existence of trash anywhere.
but joe and i are criticizing (as  jeff acknowledged) an excess of unreflective feeling, not feelingper se.
it’s impossible to shoot fluidly with anything but a digital slr (where the image is deflected by the mirror through the reflex prism to the viewfinder).
i’d loved and studied for nearly twenty years.
rather, i saw the postmodernist position not as a personal affront but as rigid, unimaginative, and inappropriate for young students with a relatively constrained view of what could be possible in life and in art.
jeff’s list includes let us now praise famous men by walker evans and james agee (of course),you have seen their faces by margaret bourke-white and erskine caldwell, andan american exodus by dorothea lange and paul taylor.
we held two openings: one for the parents of the babies i’d  photographed and the hospital staff, another for the usual art crowd.
what some might characterize as a performance of breathtaking dishonesty and cynicism was to me a strategy for survival—for which, as it happened, i was more than adequately equipped.
eventually, once i’d chosen the prints with the help of some photographer friends and written the captions with the assistance of one of the nurses in the ward, i piled all the framed prints into my van one sunday morning and headed off to the gallery.
“you never know where you are with production,” said brecht, “production is the unforeseeable.
permalink | comments (4) looking at jeff ward’s photographs at visible darkness over the past few months, i often used to wonder why he stopped making those beautiful, mysterious, intelligent pictures.
i began to think of this while reviewing  significant documentary photography books published between 1937-1941.
szarkowski writes in the accompanying text: bourke-while had an excellent sense of simple, poster-like design, and a  sophisticated photographic technique, both perhaps the legacy of her  apprenticeship in the demanding field of industrial reportage.
if i’d listened to her unbiased advice, if i’d been  able to put aside my pathological distaste for art theory, if i’d been  really open to experience… i could have created a work of far greater  depth and complexity.
one of my happiest memories of being married is driving with my wife through alabama on a sunday afternoon in the early eighties, listening to gospel music on the colored radio station.
i certainly did other midlife crisis kinds of things: quitting my teaching job at the university art school, drinking too much, going out with girls half my age.
i was so taken by the  “honeymoon” photograph (at left) that i tracked down a copy of the  japan book viaabebooks.com and just received an email from the merchant to say  that they’ll ship it to me today.
as a codicil, the author of a spanish web site refers to an old arab fable  i’d not encountered before: a young caliph asked the great vizier how he could tell if a poem was good  or bad.
now via dpreview comes news that casio “has announced a new two megapixel version of its ultra small, ultra thin ‘exilim’ digital camera.”
the  photographs were well-received, the reviews were enthusiastic, the show would  tour to other galleries, the assessors were impressed.
i hadn’t figured out exactly what i was going to do.
baby-boom and younger academics in english often project a sanctimony about their secular political-cultural convictions that i never see when my divinity school colleagues touch on their religious beliefs.
and i would quote lisette model’s famous dictum: the camera is an instrument of detection.. we photograph what we know and what we don’t know… when i point my camera at something i am asking a question and the photograph is sometimes an answer…
sturgeon says: sturgeon’s law originally was “nothing is always absolutely so.”
my search for a small, fast (i.e. minimal shutter lag) digital camera  continues.
margaret bourke-white & online books jeff ward wrote: i’ve been radically unsuccessful at anything resembling normal sleep  for a couple of days now.
what is it about  architecture school, i often ask myself, that turns decent people into  insufferable know-it-alls?
not necessarily a bad thing, given their backgrounds and interest in literature.
i’ve been wanting to write about mono no aware for a while.
“you never know  where you are with production,” said brecht, “production is the  unforeseeable.
dorothea might point out that circumstances conspired to ensure my success,  that someone else—lacking my cunning and audacity—might well have  been crucified.
i am the one who is getting the  lesson.
i suggest that accomplished bloggers, doc included, are practising a discipline that szarkowski defines here: as a way of beginning, one might compare the art of photography to the act of pointing.
it looks like my search for a fast,  carry-everywhere digital camera is over.
i learned to write in order to fill the void that opened up when i stopped making pictures.
the personal truly is political.
photography was my first choice, but specifically,  what?
that’s part of what this website has been about.
permalink | comments (1) saturday 31 august 2002 dreams can come true wanting a small digital camera i could take with me everywhere, i seriously  considered the casio exilim ex-s1, before finally concluding: “if the [ex-s1] had a resolution of two megapixels instead of one,  i’d buy it immediately.”
in the realm of no senses loren webster and jeff ward continue the discussion on sentimentality, as  joe duemer points to the superb analysis of the sentimentalist warblogger  narrative atliberal arts mafia.
out of the hundreds of finished 11 x 14 color prints from my various false starts and the thousands of unprinted negatives, i picked one failed project: pictures of suburban gardens, artfully lit with a mix of ambient daylight and fill-in flash, which i knew she would like—precisely because their emptiness and sterility had been the catalyst for my venturing into the intensive care ward.
walking through the peace park, which contains an astonishing array of kitsch sculpture, i saw a gigantic statue of a japanese woman looking lovingly at a dove perched near her shoulder.
i don’t know whether the system was particularly slack in those days but when i commenced the ma the emphasis was firmly on art practice: my obligations were to make photographs, write regular progress reports, meet occasionally with a supervisor, and present the finished work in a gallery where it would be judged by independent assessors.
this is a marvellous idea for a book and, given how much i’ve learned from jeff’s ideas about walker evans, i can’t wait to read the book as it takes shape since jeff is ideally qualified to write about the documentary photography of that (or any other) era.
all i can say about my experience of academia is that i taught until my passion and commitment were exhausted and that in the time i was there i made a set of photographs that combined the best parts of me, the parents, children, doctors, and nurses
there are two comprehensive reviews, at steve’s digicams and the  digital camera resource page.
and i became close to people.
the other thing was known as “sturgeon’s  revelation.”
permalink sunday 02 march 2003 my brush with academia i imagine my “overdetermined revulsion” (as akma might put it)  for architects results from never having met one i liked.
again he could be writing about what happened in the art school: the baby boomers have prevailed.
i  didn’t give a rat’s arse about my supervisor’s opinion, pomo  theory, or my academic career.
here’s the kicker, though: i’d only have to meet one architect i liked for my revulsion to evaporate.
“this will reward your attention.”
it is not difficult to imagine a person—a mute virgil of the corporeal world—who might elevate the act of pointing to a creative plane, a person who would lead us through the fields and streets and indicate a sequence of phenomena and aspects that would be beautiful, humorous, morally instructive, cleverly ordered, mysterious, or astonishing, once brought to our attention, but that had been unseen before, or seen dumbly, without comprehension.
and i was already fragile, since i’d placed myself in the most  extreme situation i could imagine, other than war—the point at which life  begins and is immediately under threat.
here’s the kicker, though: i’d only have to meet one architect  i liked for my revulsion to evaporate.
i was supposed to be on the road to visit my parents, but i’ve ended up researching an idea.
but many of them rose to the challenge, freed themselves  from their habitual seeing, and started to observe the world afresh.
i guess i’ll have to keep looking—though the features i’m after may just be too idiosyncratic.
for many parents, i had created a record of their child’s struggle towards recovery and their responses to that struggle; for a lonely few, my photographs are the only tangible evidence of their baby’s brief existence.
permalink | comments (5) tonight at the video store, where i’d gone to pick up philip kaufman’s movie of kundera’s the unbearable lightness of being , the rental clerk asked me if i had a reward card (rent five, get one free).
the list was small at first, but it’s been expanded a bit with a few books that i wasn’t aware of until now.
more importantly, after three years as a member of the visual arts board (the australian equivalent of thenea), i was neither shocked nor surprised by the duplicity of art politics.
it’s probably true that canberra has nothing in common with bakersfield.
forget the thumbnail sketches, choose either the 800x600 or 1024x768 show, sit back, and let the images wash over you.

some viewers thought my photographs were intrusive, that i had exploited vulnerable people at a desperately unhappy time in their lives.
it is composed of the song of others; there is no choice in this.
so those standard devices are rendered  unable to stand in for anything except what they actually are.
over  the sixteen week semester, i’d show 21 photographers (11 whose work i  loved, and 10 whose work i thought was important but didn’t much like at  all).
i suppose what i wanted most of all was mystery, and mystery just won’t come when called.

sony has just announced theirdsc-u10, another 1-megapixel camera about the size of a tiny mobile phone.
perhaps this is simply a matter of taste, or ignorance.
an hour of lies a month was inconsequential compared with the truth i encountered every day in the ward.
control, control, control … the world must be ordered, there must be some sense behind it all.
but i still want to address jeff ward’s two long posts about sentiment, feeling, and sentimentality.
the working title  thus far isimaginary heroes:
permalink | comments (2) frustrated with my current digital camera (a sony dsc-s70), i followed a link fromscripting news to ray ozzie’s weblog, where he sings the praises of thecasio exilim ex-s1, “the best camera [ray] ever owned.”
but i hadn’t heard of bristol and  certainly didn’t know that he had collaborated with john steinbeck; nor  was i aware of his japan and korea photographs.
in doing so, i learned that my only loyalty was to the individuals  i’d photographed and the images that resulted from our collaboration.
fifteen years ago i quit a well-paid, tenured, enjoyable position as a lecturer in photography in a university art school because i no longer had the energy or inclination to argue with the ideologues who had taken control.
when i taught the history of  20th century photography, the classes devoted to model and levitt were  invariably well-received—particularly by students who’d assumed  that diane arbus was the only important woman photographer.
about the same dimensions as a credit card and only half an inch thick.

ever sincesteve himmer and joseph duemer discussed writing a novel online, i’ve been seriously considering writing my own book about post-war japan publicly.
just as jeff suggested, it’s a real  find: beautifully constructed photographs of everyday life in postwar japan in  fourteen individual portfolios.
it’s clear that the demand for itty-bitty digital cameras is strong.
this could be a perfect example of the old adage: don’t buy the  first model of anything, wait until they get it right the second time around.
i like the idea of  doing it in public; it will be like having advance reviewers.
a  greater negative, however, is the sony’s shutter lag, an unfortunate  “feature” of most digital cameras.
for the nearly twenty years that i was a photographer, i was never bored for an instant.
not necessarily a bad thing, given their backgrounds and interest in  literature.
this talented practitioner of the new discipline (the discipline a cross, perhaps, between theater and criticism) would perform with a special grace, sense of timing, narrative sweep, and wit, thus endowing the act not merely with intelligence, but with that quality of formal rigor that identifies a work of art, so that we would be uncertain, when remembering the adventure of the tour, how much of our pleasure and sense of enlargement had come from the things pointed to and how much from a pattern created by the pointer.

i’d booked an exhibition at the sydney gallery where i normally  showed my work.
i’ve always thought that margaret bourke-white and dorothea lange are monumentally overrated—the former melodramatic, the latter sentimental, both their reputations inflated by virtue of their sex.
bourke-while became very skillful at this technique, which required especially delicate calculation when the level of the interior flash had to be balanced against the level of natural light visible through a room’s windows.
it’s only recently i’ve realized that she could well have been  precisely the right supervisor for someone else, an insight that depended on  both the passing of time and my “meeting” a couple of  post-modernists and/or post-structuralists i like and respect.
for a long time, i used nikon f models for exactly the same reason as jeff: the viewfinder showed 100% of the frame.

whether one focuses on reducing the bad or adding to the good is probably determined by experience and temperament.
it read: for this semester, the following subjects are declared off-limits to  first-year photography students: closeups of bark on tree trunks shadows cast by sunlight streaming though a blind grizzled old men with silvery whiskers coils of wet rope on sand toddlers with ice cream smeared on their faces nudes grainy pictures printed on high contrast paper portraits in which the subject stares at the camera slow exposures of water running over rocks unmade beds these subjects have been photographed so much over the past few years that  they are exhausted and in need of a holiday.

my former supervisor would tell the story differently—and, for some readers (or many), her version might be equally persuasive.

[tereza] felt a rush of admiration for sabina, and because sabina treated her as a friend it was an admiration free of fear and suspicion and quickly turned into friendship.
the obsession of the former is lyrical: what they seek in women is themselves, their ideal, and since an ideal is by definition something that can never be found, they are disappointed again and again.
so, when dorothea attacks academia and jeff defends it, it seems to me that they are each describing different aspects of the same institution, since universities are just as subject to sturgeon’s law (“ninety percent of everything is crud”) as every other area of human endeavor.
the result is a work of maddening, frightful inspiration, a masterpiece by any standards but a masterpiece that parades its flaws with poignant, nearly tragic recklessness.

baby-boom and younger academics in english often project a sanctimony  about their secular political-cultural convictions that i never see when my  divinity school colleagues touch on their religious beliefs.
the obsession of the epic womanizer strikes people as lacking in redemption (redemption by disappointment).
i learned more than i can adequately describe.
steve himmer suggests a reason: i wonder if it’s an issue of students having the poetic tools they’ve absorbed from the canon—the nature imagery, weather, etc.—but not cutting close enough with them to the experiences they’re trying to represent.
i realize now how i imposed my prejudices on the students but at least they were clearly stated.
i had commenced photographing in the neonatal intensive care unit of the children’s hospital in sydney and thought a computer might bring some order to my unwieldy project.
measuring 92.6 x 71.0 x 27.0 mm (3.65 x 2.8 x 1 in), the dsc-f77 has about the same dimensions as the credit card sizedcasio exilim ex-s2 that was previously at the top of my list (admittedly the sony camera is significantly thicker but it’s still a light, pocketable camera).
and pay attention to the edges of the frame, there’s so much going on.
there are two comprehensive reviews, at steve’s digicams and the digital camera resource page.
but by the time i was photographing in the hospital, the pomo clique was firmly in control and i’d grown used to having my values dismissed as “idealist,” “transcendentalist,” or “essentialist.”
i showed the pictures—the best work i had ever done—atwatters gallery in august 1987 to general, though not universal, acclaim.
it’s an absolutely remarkable photograph: about picture-making (look at  all the pictures within the picture, including the windows, as szarkowski  points out below); about generations (the portrait  of—probably—henlein’s grandfather on the wall behind his  father and that of his grandmother on the wall behind his mother, reflected in  the mirror); and about history (what will become of them when the nazis arrive?
but joe and i are criticizing (as jeff acknowledged) an excess of unreflective feeling, not feelingper se.
she was excited by the new opportunities presented by photoflash bulbs, which made possible clear and highly detailed pictures under circumstances that would otherwise have been difficult or impossible for photography.
the use of two or three  bulbs, synchronized to flash together as the shutter was released, could  produce a reasonable simulation of normal interior light.
whereas once i regarded pomo theory (and theorists) with revulsion, as a  consequence of reading akma’s and jeff’s weblogs over the past  year, i’m more open to viewing the world through theoretical (rather than  purely experiential) eyes.
all i can say about my experience of academia is that i taught until my  passion and commitment were exhausted and that in the time i was there i made a  set of photographs that combined the best parts of me, the parents, children,  doctors, and nurses
what is it about architecture school, i often ask myself, that turns decent people into insufferable know-it-alls?
i’d photographed and the images that resulted from our collaboration.

but little rock still has something close to a small town mentality, though i confess that it’s actually less “hickish” than bakersfield… just for giggles, i had to look up the figures for canberra—313,000 according to the tourist web site.
because nothing is always absolutely so.
there was no way i could expose their experience or mine to any  “theoretical analysis.”
it has a fixed focus 5.6mm/f2.5 lens (equivalent to 37mm on 35mm camera).
the fields lie there, with nothing at work in them, neither man nor beast.
i’m glad to have been reminded of it.
for all of its supposed faults,let us now praise famous men remains one of my favorite books.
and if loren found himself “a little surprised by [his] own actions in defending the word” and by being labeled a “sentimentalist,” i can only wonder at the irony of my newfound guise as the scrooge of blogaria, denigrator of human feeling and thoroughly unsentimental modernist.
i knew instinctively that my project would be anathema, that her enervated  theorizing applied to the raw emotion of my pictures could only harm me and the  work.
nevertheless, i remain interested: the tiny size and no shutter lag make it an ideal point-and-shoot camera while the 1-megapixel (960x1280) image is more than sufficient for web display, asjeff’s image gallery proves (steve, inexplicably, took most of his gallery pictures at the interpolated 1200x1600 resolution, so that most of them look soft).
krupnick’s essaywhy are english departments still fighting the culture  wars?
in first year it’s common  for photo students to try all kinds of wacky “techniques” as they  regurgitate every hackneyed picture they’ve ever seen.
we traveled through the south, visiting most of the places walker evans photographed as well as many of the towns where robert frank had taken pictures forthe americans.
as  ray puts it: the resolution is perfectly fine for on-screen viewing, it has a great  flash, it has ample capacity when used with a 128mb memory card, it beats out  even the blackberry in terms of its battery life (weeks), and best of all, it  boots and is ready to snap a picture in sub-one-second.
i’m also willing to admit—having  encountered a variety of smart, engaging academics amongst the faculty of u  blog—that not everyone who works in a university is either a cynical  opportunist, a ruthless careerist, or a time-serving hack.
it’s only recently i’ve realized that she could well have been precisely the right supervisor for someone else, an insight that depended on both the passing of time and my “meeting” a couple of post-modernists and/or post-structuralists i like and respect.
the james bond spy camera frustrated with my current digital camera (a sony dsc-s70), i followed a  link fromscripting news to ray ozzie’s weblog, where he sings the praises  of thecasio exilim ex-s1, “the best camera [ray] ever owned.”
in doing so, i learned that my only loyalty was to the individuals
to the delight of my  parents, i got my ma.
is it only because the personifications—of wind, sun, moon—are so often cliches, or is there some further deflection of reality taking place?
every day i saw ordinary people,  faced with appalling misfortune, behave with the most extraordinary courage and  dignity.
i took a half-dozen garden prints to our first meeting and encouraged her  to tell me how they could be improved.
so those standard devices are rendered unable to stand in for anything except what they actually are.
given that  documentary photographs are never transparently truthful, but invariably  constructed, i admire pictures that acknowledge the fundamental dishonesty that  lies at their core, even as they pretend to depict “reality.”
no matter how much i dislike margaret bourke-white, she took one photograph that influenced my own picture-making enormously: margaret bourke-white: henlein’s parents, reichenau, sudeten section of czechoslovakia, 1938
wanting a small digital camera i could take with me everywhere, i seriously considered the casio exilim ex-s1, before finally concluding: “if the [ex-s1] had a resolution of two megapixels instead of one, i’d buy it immediately.”
steve himmer suggests a reason: i wonder if it’s an issue of students having the poetic tools  they’ve absorbed from the canon—the nature imagery, weather,  etc.—but not cutting close enough with them to the experiences  they’re trying to represent.
as soon as the salesman realized i was a serious buyer, he switched into upsell mode and showed meminolta dimage x, a 2-megapixel model with a 3x optical zoom (the 1-megapixel casio has a fixed focus 5.6mm wide angle lens).
better still, i might have continued to teach happily at the university instead of resigning my tenured position, splitting up with the lovely woman i’d been seeing for a couple of years, and abandoning photography, thus diving headlong into a midlife crisis.
in 1987 i bought a macintosh.
the shutter lag isn’t appreciable, i can imagine taking it with me everywhere, and the 2-megapixel resolution is a lot more appealing.
a month later, i showed her another five or six photographs, sprinkling a fine dust of theory over the prints as i explained how i’d put her advice into practice.
and for many years all my pictures, whether taken indoors or  outside, used flash to balance the illumination and flatten the picture plane,  just as margaret bourke-white taught me.
(i felt a kind of perverse desire to be castigated  as a “bourgeois individualist” but maoist invective had fallen out  of fashion by the mid-eighties.)
first,  starting with the invasion of french poststructuralism in the 1960s, advanced  literary interpretation changed from being formalist in method and  traditionalist in ideology to a brand of french theory whose major  distinguishing characteristic seemed to be that it required you to spend more  time reading the theorists than reading the canonical texts of western  literature.
again he could be  writing about what happened in the art school: the baby boomers have prevailed.

i guess i’ll have to keep looking—though the  features i’m after may just be too idiosyncratic.
in what must have been an accidental irony, a malicious joke, or a deliberate attempt to bring me under control, i was assigned the “supervisor from hell”: an up-and-coming young marxist-feminist with a phd in post-structuralist art theory.
but the culture wars have petered out in many departments.
you never know what’s going to come out.”
maybe my disaffection sprang from a conviction that television had rendered photography almost irrelevant, a process only hastened by its elevation to the status of an art.
yet my only  concern was that photography students use their cameras to engage their world  with passion and commitment—for me, photography was a primarily a method  for exploring ideas and emotions.
whereas joe pointed out—and i picked up on—the connection between  sentimentality and brutality in warblogging posts, loren and jeff argued for  sentimentality as a valid human response to lived experience (jeff would use sentiment as a synonym for feeling).
to find in those rectilinear spaces something that i felt was inside myself.
the theodore sturgeon faq explains how the law originated: in his 1972 interview with david g hartwell (published in the new york review of science fiction #7 and #8, march and april 1989)
whether one focuses on reducing the bad or adding to the good is probably  determined by experience and temperament.
i hope i don’t have to wait too long for it to arrive in australia.
in the case of the picture opposite, the photographer evidently  miscalculated a little, but the picture is surely more interesting as it is  than it would be if naturalistically correct.
it’s reasonable to assume that my copy of kundera’s novel originally belonged to one or other of the young women.
the size impressed me immediately—one disadvantage of the sony is that it’s just too big to take with meeverywhere.
she was excited  by the new opportunities presented by photoflash bulbs, which made possible  clear and highly detailed pictures under circumstances that would otherwise  have been difficult or impossible for photography.
jeff never wanted to be a writer.
resolution, so that most of them look soft).
then i settled on the hasselblad.
references to thomas browne’s father being a silk merchant; the purple piece of silk in the urn of patroculus; the silken ropes given to hsien-feng’s viceroys so that they may hang themselves, an act of benevolence as their sentence decreed that they …be dismembered and sliced into slices.
i used to devote a class to the work of either one or a pair of photographers: bourke-white and lange shared a double bill (as did ansel adams and henri-cartier bresson).
sebald liberally sprinkles  references to silk throughout the book, as an adult would sprinkle clues for a  child at an easter egg hunt.
the first reference i can find in his oeuve appears in the march 1958 issue  ofventure science fiction, where he wrote: i repeat sturgeon’s revelation, which was wrung out of me after  twenty years of wearying defense of science fiction against attacks of people  who used the worst examples of the field for ammunition, and whose conclusion  was that ninety percent of sf is crud.
in order to be heard, they rearrange the  language they inherit into something that is unique to them.
i think i’ll hold back to see how jeff approaches the activity but ever since he broached the subject my sleeping patterns have been shot to pieces too.
it think there is a synergy between text and image that is rarely explored, let alone exploited to full advantage.
but i was interested enough to track down some detailed appraisals of the casio camera—ray’s weblog post is merely a recommendation from a satisfied owner, not a review that balances the camera’s strong points with its shortcomings.
“year after year of trying to make sense…”
you see, in a few weeks i have to  start writing a a book.
i never photographed without permission and was acutely sensitive to every agonizing nuance.
when i looked more closely, i realized she bore an uncanny resemblance toayako.
both are generally enthusiastic: about the  camera’s tiny size, its acceptable (not great) image quality, and range  of manual functions.
permalink | comments (5) friday 06 september 2002 sony does it (yet) again ain’t capitalism wonderful?
worse still, the camera doesn’t the memorize flash mode after power off, a major disadvantage for someone whonever, ever takes pictures with flash.
the students  lost most of all.
i’d booked an exhibition at the sydney gallery where i normally showed my work.
fifteen years ago i quit a well-paid, tenured, enjoyable position as a  lecturer in photography in a university art school because i no longer had the  energy or inclination to argue with the ideologues who had taken control.
