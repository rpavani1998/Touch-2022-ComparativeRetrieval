the nice thing about digital work is that we can retain all of the versions on the table.the colours give an "earthy" feel (in colours) to the image, but i think that the blue mop, red thing on the floor and the green tie around the brush don't fit with the rest of the image.you can hand any chimp a $10,000 camera set up, but that doesn't make the chimp a photographer.mainly because the color version seems to be a "rustic" shot, but the blue plastic mop and the red plastic dust pan or whatever it is give it a posed or contrived feel.it is only through challenge that we can survive, if you can no longer challenge yourself, you have reached your end.nikon 70-200 f/2.8 | nikon 35mm f/1.8 | nikon sb-700 flash quote from: gil p on april 11, 2011, 05:18:24 pm once you've created your own, you'll be done faster than 16year old at a massage parlour....the blue mop though stands out too much from the rest (slightly used and has even a bar code on it) even with slight desaturation.both good shots, i just like the "feel" of the b&w better.logged you can hand any chimp a $10,000 camera set up, but that doesn't make the chimp a photographer.logged nikon d60 | nikon 70-200 f/2.8 | nikon 35mm f/1.8 | nikon sb-700 flash quote from: gil p on april 11, 2011, 05:18:24 pm once you've created your own, you'll be done faster than 16year old at a massage parlour....this is the reason i made another version in mono to blend the blue mop.as is, i prefer the b&w but would vote for the colour if it gets adjusted logged http://hopkinsfoto.com 1dsiii, 5dii | 200l f2.0 is | 135l f2 | 85l f1.2 | 35l f1.4 | 70-200l f2.8 | 24-70l f2.8 | 16-35l f2.8 | 24-105l f4 | 15mm fish f2.8 insane in the membrane magnum2012 follow re: which is better... « reply #9 on: february 27, 2012, 11:44:23 pm » thank you for the comments i applied some dragan workflow to intensify details and increased vignetting to hide several unnecessary items from the image to make the old feel look.i like the color, but i would cut back on the vignetting.as is, i prefer the b&w but would vote for the colour if it gets adjusted logged http://hopkinsfoto.com 1dsiii, 5dii | 200l f2.0 is | 135l f2 | 85l f1.2 | 35l f1.4 | 70-200l f2.8  | 24-70l f2.8 | 16-35l f2.8 | 24-105l f4 | 15mm fish f2.8 insane in the membranelogged common sense is not so common.
