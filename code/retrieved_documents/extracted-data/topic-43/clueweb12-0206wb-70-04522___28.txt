in my example (with canon powershot a520), the dark photo was made with: aperture f 3.2, exposure time 0.100 sec; and the light one with: aperture f 3.2, exposure time 0.400 sec.
but, i do  believe that lighting is the most effective tool of a great cave picture (and,  after all, you are providing all the lighting for the image), so i’m  going to point out some tips fromephotozine: cave photographers mostly use flashguns as their primary light, followed by  bulbs as their second main source.
a remote switch is a cable with a switch on the end – just  as simple as that.
more than that, a friend of mine has an  universal remote controller which is his tv controller and camera controller in  the same device.
this also helps to eliminate the need for tripod.

using the flash is not necessary if you want to create a mystery  scene in which all is black but the lamp illuminated formation.
longer exposure time in this case: 20 sec..
this means you will find interesting sinuous shapes of roads.
this means their maximum exposure time is likely to be shorter than  that for film cameras.
but, to be more specific, a good photograph does not have a person  “standing” in the picture, but actually “doing”  something: climbing or other action inside the cave.
sometimes the cave passage itself, if it is reflective, can serve as a bit of  soft box on its own.

a remote switch will allow you to fire your camera without the need to touch it.
this one trick will do more to make your fireworks pictures  stand out than any other single thing you can do.
now let’s see the close-ups: the most simple setting scheme is: “program” mode, rear flash, adjusted exposure (differs from scene to scene), tripod and remote control or 2 seconds shutter delay.
if you have an slr camera, this should be no problem.
lighting placement may seem easy at first until you get your processed images back and discover the glaringly over or underexposed portions of the photograph.
by this time, you’re probably miles away from  the cave with no intention of returning to it anytime soon.
notice that in most of the cases the road should be free of cars and walkers.
to close the camera shutter, simply  slide the remote switch button back and let go.
this means that it not possible to use a tc-80n3 with any of the e3-compatible cameras, such as the eos 350d or 400d. nikon mc30 and mc-36 remotes (designed for use with nikon slr cameras equipped with a 10-pin remote terminal) are compatible with nikon d300, d200, d100 (with mb-d100 grip attached), d3, d2h, d2hs, d2x, d1, d1h, d1x, f100, f6, f5, f90x and f90.
in close-up shots, the use of a softened light (soft box or even just a  piece of tissue over the flash tube) is frequently better than a hard light.

as for the  connectors, take a look at e3 and n3 in the firts place, but note that there is  no adaptor that allows you to use a n3 remote switch with an e3-compatible  camera.
step 3: adjust your camera settings like this: - continuous mode active with the maximum number of shots and about 1s delay between - some cameras have a preset â€œfireworks modeâ€ that automatically adjusts shutter speed and aperture (like most of the canon models), but if your camera doesnâ€™t have it, hereâ€™s a hint: shutter speed: 2 , aperture: 8.0 - if you done the first step, donâ€™t worry to much about the iso so let it as low as possible for low noise; also donâ€™t set the flash on - if the camera has a sharpening adjustment control, set it to very sharp step 4: when actually pressing the shutter button, wait for the burst to explode, but, until that moment, keep the button half-pressed (focused ready).
play around with the â€œneutrals â€ until you are satisfied with the color gradient around the lamp.

answer: digital cameras need power when the shutter is open to keep the cmos sensor  active.
focusing can be similarly difficult.
trying to photograph large formations, especially when they are beyond the limits of your headlamp, can be nearly impossible.
when shooting, make several frames with different exposures.

“there are some special do’s and don’ts that will help digital photographers get the best results,” notes delaney.
the salvation in this case is aphotoshop manipulation.
and, if you’re like many of  us, plan to have your camera ready to capture the “rockets red  glare.”
(this is called double exposure technique) some in-deep readings i recommend: digital photography school fireworks tips very creative images to illustrate photojojo fireworks photography tips an advanced reading fireworks picture gallery tags: fireworks photography, 4th july, independence day, photographing fireworks, fireworks, fireworks pictures shooting against the light has always been a tricky thing in photography: if you choose to set a longer exposure or just to increase the exposure compensation in order to have plenty of light over the near subject, the background will appear burned (overexposed).
step 5: your final image can be processed on the computer in order to obtain more fireworks in one single picture: a merging process of more shots with no blending.
in a photoshop document, place the 2 frames as different layers in such way that the darker one will be under the lighter one.
lighting placement may seem easy at first until you get  your processed images back and discover the glaringly over or underexposed  portions of the photograph.
sometimes the cave passage itself, if it is reflective, can serve as a bit of soft box on its own.

for the  first christmas tree picture, my friend tudor used flash (with -2 exposure) in  rear mode, in low light.
exposure +3,+4, +5 (depending on how illuminated the scene was) – if your camera supports bracketing, do so – it’s very hard to get the right exposure from the first shot 4.
question: how long can this exposure be?
picture was taken in “shutter mode”.
itâ€™s much recommended to have a tripod and take the pictures using it because of 2 reasons: a brighter picture may require a longer exposure time (if you donâ€™t want to deal with a lot of noise you will prefer a longer time instead of higher iso and aperture) so you need to avoid camera shake (no matter how steady your hands are, night condition will always require a tripod), and the second reason: the frames should be taken from the same angle and viewpoint.
the biggest problem is  that you are working in near total darkness.
trying to photograph large  formations, especially when they are beyond the limits of your headlamp, can be  nearly impossible.
the darkness of the sky should cause your camera to keep the shutter open for a time-exposure, and you can end up with a splendid picture.
