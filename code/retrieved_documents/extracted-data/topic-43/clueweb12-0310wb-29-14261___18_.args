for consumers who are into family, travel and children sports photography and prefer a simpleslr with more lens selections, this is an excellent camera at a very reasonable price.for indoor work, nikon now has a very affordable 35mm/f1.8 af-s dx lens that is highly popular among consumerdslr users.additionally, the d5000 has the following extra features over the d3000: in summary, the d5000 provides some more advanced features for more serious photographers.in a way it is less convenient for the photographer and can slow down the operation, but it seems to be a reasonable compromise for the sake of small size and therefore limlited space on the camera.similar to the nikon d200, d80, d40x, and d60, the 10mp ccd sensor nikon uses gives good highiso results up to about 800.which makes it a more versatile camera than any other camera at the moment during sunny day light.however, the grip on the right side of the camera body still has sufficient thickness so that people with larger hands can feel comfortable holding these small cameras.it is convenient for early beginners, but once you learn how the aperture, shutter speed, andiso settings affect the image, you can easily decide on those settings yourself.since the dynamic range of the sensor is limited, this is extremely useful in high contrast situations.for the more serious photographers who prefer more controls and user options, the d5000 and especially d90 should be better choices.for telephoto lenses, nikon has an affordable 55-200mm/f3.5-5.6 af-s vr which is good optically but also on the slow side with a maximum aperture of f5.6 on the long (200mm) end.in summary, the d5000 provides some more advanced features for more serious photographers.high-iso results similar to the nikon d200, d80, d40x, and d60, the 10mp ccd sensor nikon uses gives good highiso results up to about 800.optically this lens is good and the vibration reduction (vr) feature is a great help.i think a big drawback to nikon entry level dslrs is that while they'll mount and shoot with the legacy glass, they will not meter with it, which makes the whole idea of compatibility of the mount moot.
