the primary advantages of having a digital sensor the same size (24x36mm) as a frame of 35mm film are (1) higher image quality, especially in terms of noise and especially in lower light situations, and (2) the ability to use very wide angle lenses.a real photographer is the one who composes the shot perfectly and with their knowledge and technical ability will be able to capture a beautiful photo in 1 single shot rather than taking hundreds and finding the best one.it also allows me a greater amount of control over the in camera exposure settings and my results are getting better all the time.digital allows photographers to experiment and create images with the camera in a way that is much too expensive for most people to do with film.digital cameras and the digital workflow have made creating or capturing a great image much easier and much more likely for novice and amateur photographers (i admit i am one of these people however i have a "moral code" regarding the level of digital adjustments i will make).digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images and are extremely useful tool for the most common circumstances.autofocus performance is superb, even in dim light, with 15 af sensors distributed around the frame.the only disadvantage to having a full-frame sensor compared to a small-sensor digital slr body (canon digital rebel or any nikon) is that the small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses, which can be useful when you are doing sports or bird photography.as a keen amateur for 25 years, i've owned a 5d for almost a year now and continue to be wowed by the results it yields, with, like any camera, a discerning eye, a sensitivity for the subject matter and a sense of imagination...it certainly depends on the person using the camera and i believe that you need to have the flare and artistic ability to be able to use any camera (including digital) to produce beautiful images.in very practical terms, that is, a 600mm lens will give results in terms of image size comparable to 900mm lens when used on a sensor approximately 2/3 the length and width of a full frame sensor.digital unlocks creative possibilities because you never have to worry about how many shots you have left (or how many you need to get the image you want).in all it's been a hell of a workhorse camera for me, producing consistently high quality images even under adverse conditions.i also enjoy digital photography and have been able to support my hobby by creating portraits for people through digital art.in some respects, art is the way one interprets what one perceives and presents that interpretation so others can experience that expression.
