the blue mop though stands out too much from the rest (slightly used and has even a bar code on it) even with slight desaturation.
both good shots, i just like the "feel" of the b&w better.

the colours give an "earthy" feel (in colours) to the image, but i think that the blue mop, red thing on the floor and the green tie around the brush don't fit with the rest of the image.

mainly because the color version seems to be a "rustic" shot, but the blue plastic mop and the red plastic dust pan or whatever it is give it a posed or contrived feel.
the nice thing about digital work is that we can retain all of the versions on the table.

i'll change my question to which do you prefer, and why?
i totally disagree and find it detracts from the image.
i like the color, but i would cut back on the vignetting.
