by the time they're in the market, can show off what they're capable of, and have their prices down -- say, by early next year -- the console makers could be kicking off their next-next-generation early design efforts.
with the market for new stocks still flat, many entrepreneurs just want to get scooped up by one of the few internet giants like yahoo, google or media mogul barry diller's aic/interactivecorp.

the wintel platform has overwhelming market share, true.

after a developer's software is created using the nikon sdk, a nef file can be opened, edited in either tiff or jpeg format, and then saved in formats available in the developers' software.
meanwhile, apple is about to ship tiger, and from the looks of it, tiger might have just as many new features -- if not more -- than longhorn.
the thought that i might be dependent on a proprietary sdk to read some of the information in any of them is upsetting -- and in fact i do have a few photographs taken with the mechanically and optically excellent nikon d70 camera we have at work.

leaving aside partisanship for a moment -- and only for a moment -- i find it curious that the republicans seem to be focused on the powers theydon't have instead of the powers theydo: senator bill frist, the majority leader, has agreed to join a handful of prominent christian conservatives in a telecast portraying democrats as "against people of faith" for blocking president bush's [judicial] nominees.
one reason ageia has garnered such support is its chip could tip the scales in the pc's battle with game consoles.
in the latter, the republicans are now invoking the name of god again, saying that the removal of a longstanding senate rule, used quite often by themselves when they were the minority party, is somehow against god's will.
open source developers and interested end-users need not apply.
as far as i can tell, whatever the republicans may wish their post-election message to be, in reality, based on their actions to date, it has been the following: social security reform is a good idea in theory, but the president has never actually advanced a plan, and the plans advanced by his vassals have been incompetent at best.
as it is, i'm not a republican (nor am i a democrat), and so, partisanship picked up from the side table once again, i find much of what the republicans have been doing to be disgusting.
but i think the web community (if it's possible to say such a thing) now understands the roach motel concept, and though it's too late with regard to office, we don't want to let it happen again.

ageia's president, curtis davis, argues that they will when they realize physics is key to situations where they try to do something in a game and the environment doesn't respond.
nikon responds, and as a marketing person, i don't know whether to be in awe or contempt of their attempt to clarify their position while saying absolutely nothing: the nikon d2x professional digital single lens reflex camera has received widely positive acclaim for its overall performance and image processing quality.

i don't believe the average iq is any higher in cupertino than it is in redmond, nor do i believe apple has some secret project management sauce that microsoft lacks.
the nikon d2x is capable of producing high quality images that can be saved in a variety of file formats, including the proprietary nikon electronic format (nef), standard tiff and several levels of standard jpeg compressed files.
