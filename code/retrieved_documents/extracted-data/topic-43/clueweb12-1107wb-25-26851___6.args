the nikon d700 does have an excellent autofocus (af) system.
however, when the nikon d3 was released it was already critized for having a sensor with only 12 megapixels.
so, it’s interesting to see that the d800 now has a lower frame rate of 4 fps, while canon has substantially increased their frame rate to 6 fps.
the feature that i personally find most important is the high iso performance.
the pluses of the 5d mark ii are that is has a lot of megapixels and it has very good high iso performance.
a recentonline pole shows that about 41% of the respondents were happy with nikon’s choice to put a 36 megapixels sensor in the d800.
i myself am very interested in seeing a comparison of the specifications of these two highly anticipated cameras.
in fact they haven’t just addressed it, they have now made the sensor resolution the most prominent feature of the d800.
the canon 5d mark ii has very similar high iso performance to the nikon d700.
this might seem like a very normal thing to do to a nikon user, because nikon has been doing this for quite a while.
in addition to that, the d700 had very good high iso performance, which can still be considered very good today, almost 4 years later.
this could mean that it’s high iso performance is also two stops better.
one cf card slot and one sd card slot is a nice compromise.
others, for example landscape and architecture photographers, are really happy with the increase in sensor resolution.
the nikon d800 replaces the nikon d700, which was also a very highly acclaimed camera.
i have to say that my 5d mark ii does not satisfy my needs as much as i would like to in this area.
this is interesting because canon and nikon seem to have listened very closely at the complaints and praises about their products when the were developing their newest models.
i have been anticipating this camera for a long time, and so have lots of other photographers.

02 mar 2012 canon 5d mark iii vs nikon d800 category: for-photographers canon just released the specifications of the new canon 5d mark iii.
another interesting difference in the specs is the continuous shooting speed.
however, when the nikon d3 was released it was already critized for having a sensor with only 12 megapixels.
to me, what stands out immediately in this comparison is the sensor resolution of the nikon d800.
if are you looking at prints though, you will start seeing a difference at large print sizes, for example sizes over 45 x 30 cm.
although the advantage is negated when the d800 is fitted with its battery grip, which gives the d800 the capacity to also shoot at 6 frames per second.
the 36 megapixels of the new nikon is a 200% increase compared to the previous model, which leaves canon trailing behind by a mile.
but to some people the fps is a big deal and canon now has the advantage in this department.
i’m not going to go into details about the video capabilities of these two cameras, because to me this is not an interesting feature.
compared to the 5d mark ii, the d700 doesn’t have a lot of megapixels.
although the advantage is negated when the d800 is fitted with its battery grip, which gives the d800 the capacity to also shoot at 6 frames per second.
i have good hopes that the 5d mark iii will now actually be able to get af lock in the dark situations where i would previously have to manually focus (or miss the shot altogether).
when we look at the specs for the canon 5d mark iii, we see that this camera’s iso range goes all the way up to 102,400.
i’ve read before from someone that this was their main reason for using the d700 over the canon 5d mark ii.
this is interesting because canon and nikon seem to have listened very closely at the complaints and praises about their products when the were developing their newest models.
in addition to that, the d700 had very good high iso performance, which can still be considered very good today, almost 4 years later.
from this we can conclude that it is likely that the performance at higher iso values is comparable to the nikon d700.
for a web sized image you most likely will not see much of a difference.
again, canon seems to have really done their best to fix the achilles’ heel of the canon 5d mark ii (and the 5d classic for that matter).
the feature that i personally find most important is the high iso performance.
field tests will have to show how these camera’s really compare to each other and their predecessors.
the biggest complaint that was heard was the low sensor resolution.
we already talked about the sensor resolution a little bit.
but i will mention that the video capabilities of the 5d mark ii are better than the d700′s.
i have not been able to do a hands-on comparison of these two cameras yet, simply because they are not yet for sale.
but they share enough nice features to classify both cameras as very worthy successors to the cameras that they replace.
the canon 5d mark ii has a lot of megapixels, 21.1 mp to be precise.
to me, these numbers are not very important however because i almost always use the camera in single shot mode.
the other 59% would have rather seen the 16 megapixel sensor of the nikon d4 in the nikon d800.
the pluses of the d700 are the excellent af system and the very good iso performance.
if are you looking at prints though, you will start seeing a difference at large print sizes, for example sizes over 45 x 30 cm.
the nikon d800 is seen as the direct competitor to the canon 5d mark iii.
canon has taken the auto focus system of their top model and placed it in the 5d mark 3 body.
i shoot indoors a lot, and we have a lot of dark and dreary days over here.
to me personally 12 or 13 megapixels is enough, i don’t like having to keep buying bigger and bigger memory cards, or having to swap out my cf card all the time because it is full.
as soon as i have a production model d800 i’ll try to do a mini review blog post.
the af was also exactly the same as the system found in the nikon d3.
others, for example landscape and architecture photographers, are really happy with the increase in sensor resolution.
but, like i said, we will have to wait until these camera’s are available to the public to see how the specifications translate to actual real world performance.
but, this is fairly unique for canon.

nikon has addressed the biggest complaint about the d700.
the canon 5d mark ii has a lot of megapixels, 21.1 mp to be precise.
this was a feature that attracted a lot of people to this camera.
the nikon d800 replaces the nikon d700, which was also a very highly acclaimed camera.
but, i think that the body size of these camera’s is just too small to neatly fit two cf card slots.
the af performance on the canon 5d mark ii was something that received a lot of complaints from a lot of people.
compared to the 5d mark ii, the d700 doesn’t have a lot of megapixels.
at this point it is all somewhat speculation though because i myself haven’t gotten my hands on the d800 yet.
in fact they haven’t just addressed it, they have now made the sensor resolution the most prominent feature of the d800.
the last time that a canon prosumer body (i.e. a model just below the top model) had the same af system as its bigger sibling, was in the pre-digital age with the canon eos-3 film body.
the iso range of this camera goes up to 25,600, which is the same as it’s predecessor the d700.
so, kudos to canon for addressing this complaint in the best possible way.
it had the same af system as its predecessor, the canon 5d. this af system was already considered to be inadequate when the original canon 5d was released.
to me personally 12 or 13 megapixels is enough, i don’t like having to keep buying bigger and bigger memory cards, or having to swap out my cf card all the time because it is full.
i have been anticipating this camera for a long time, and so have lots of other photographers.
this representative said that the performance of the d800 is equivalent to the d700 at all sensitivity levels, i.e. over the entire iso range.
but i will mention that the video capabilities of the 5d mark ii are better than the d700′s.

the camera that is the successor of the very popular canon 5d mark ii.
the pluses of the d700 are the excellent af system and the very good iso performance.

canon has taken the auto focus system of their top model and placed it in the 5d mark 3 body.

so i want to be able to shoot at 6400 and higher iso without having to worry about lots of noise.
it had the same af system as its predecessor, the canon 5d. this af system was already considered to be inadequate when the original canon 5d was released.
if this is the case it would mean that the 5d mark iii would perform similar to the nikon d3s, which is the top notch camera at the moment (by a mile) when it comes to image quality at high iso’s.
so, it’s interesting to see that the d800 now has a lower frame rate of 4 fps, while canon has substantially increased their frame rate to 6 fps.

on februari 6th nikon released the specs for the nikon d800.
