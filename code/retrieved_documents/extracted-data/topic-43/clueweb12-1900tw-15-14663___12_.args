the 5d mark iii has a magnesium alloy body, which should make it more durable in the longer term than plastic-bodied cameras, and it also adds a welcome level of weather-proofing for protection against dust and moisture.this combination offered fast, positive autofocus, can track moving subjects very well an is also near-silent,a grid line display, new dual-axis electronic level and very useful live histogram can be enabled to help with composition and exposure, and you can zoom in by up to 10x magnification of the image displayed on the lcd screen.other new and improved features include a 61-point auto focus system, 63-zone metering system, enhanced weather sealing, an expanded iso range of 50-102,400, high bit-rate video compression options, larger 3.2 inch lcd screen dual cf and sd memory card slots and continuous shooting at 6 frames per second.the viewfinder has also been upgraded, now offering an improved 100% coverage to its predecessorâ€™s 98%, with a magnification of 0.71x and dioptre correction.peripheral illumination correction is a useful and effective addition, particularly for jpeg shooters, and can safely be left turned on all of the time.this combination offered fast, positive autofocus, can track moving subjects very well an is also near-silent, and i'd recommend that you choose this kit if you're buying into the canon system for the first time.there's a built-in microphone on the front of the camera for mono recording, a socket on the side for connecting an external stereo microphone, plus a headphone socket which enables sound level monitoring both during and after shooting.in-camera image rating via a new dedicated button on the rear makes it easy to organise your images ahead of post-production, with the rating maintained in iptc-friendly software.unfortunately these are much slower than the quick af mode, taking over 3 seconds to focus on a clearly-defined subject in bright light, which i think will put off most users that are attracted by the promised point-and-shoot experience.the viewfinder displays all key exposure information including the iso speed, and there are four metering modes including a tighter 1.5% spot metering mode, useful in tricky lighting conditions as an alternative to the excellent and consistent evaluative metering system.canon's system is obviously limited by which lenses you choose, but it does offer the slight advantage of showing the stabilising effect through the viewfinder.the other methods, live af and live af with face detection, use an image contrast auto-focus system, much like that used by point-and shoot compacts, the main benefits being the complete lack of noise during operation, and no lcd blackout.the 24-105mm lens also crucially features image stabilisation.digital photo professional certainly isn't the best raw converter on the market, but importantly does mimic the camera's picture styles 'retrospectively'.
