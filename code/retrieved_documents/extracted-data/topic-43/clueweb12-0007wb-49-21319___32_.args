using this camera will change your approach to wedding photography, which will make your work look different from your competitors, which will give you effective market differentiation and may increase your bookings.while leica’s lenses are traditionally three, four or five times as expensive as lenses from their competitors, generations of working photographers (and very discerning amateurs) have not hesitated to buy them, knowing that the unique characteristics of these optics can be powerful differentiators in what is otherwise a very homogeneous marketplace.rangefinder cameras were the gold standard because they offered very bright viewfinders and very accurate focusing for wide angle to moderate telephoto lenses.however, in one part of the market, the leica continued to be popular with street photographers and artists who needed a highly capable imaging machine that was both stealthy and quiet.it’s an attribute of bright line rangefinder cameras that is a good aid to both composition and to being able to anticipate objects moving into the prescribed frame.while leica’s lenses are traditionally three, four or five times as expensive as lenses from their competitors, generations of working photographers (and very discerning amateurs) have not hesitated to buy them, knowing that the unique characteristics of these optics can bewhile moire patterns do show up from time to time, these cameras have the appearance of producing image files with much greater amounts of fine and micro fine detail which, in turn, allows for greater enlarge-ability and a greater overall perception of quality.since leica lenses don’t have to be designed to compensate for the space required for a moving mirror they could optimize their designs and have the back of the lenses close to the film plane.the new mount also gave lens designers more room to work their magic with new generations of optics that, to professional photographers in that era, were amazingly good.that makes it a hand built, high precision rangefinder camera that takes a range of very well designed and produced lenses.most of their competitors build lenses with high apertures that could only be used in the direst of photographic emergencies and then with mediocre results.in order to keep the information of the sides and in the corners of the frames from falling off too quickly leica and kodak needed to come up with a way to compensate for the severe angles with which light strikes the edges of the frame.typically, the depth of field at full aperture is razor thin, limiting the usefulness when more than one subject needs to be sharply focused.with each passing week, i found my camera skills sharpening up and my reflexes improving.they were the cameras of choice for top photographers like: henri cartier bresson, robert frank, william klein, lee freidlander, sebastio salgado and many others.
