the new 5d mark iii records high-definition 1080p, wide-screen video in 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution, at a variable frame rate from 24fps to 60fps in mov format.
this is a big bonus, because other makers don't always include such good raw conversion software.
digital photo professional certainly isn't the best raw converter on the market, but importantly does mimic the camera's picture styles 'retrospectively'.
you do get a the manual in english throughout and you'll find most things that you need to know about the camera's operation in here, without the need to search through the supplied cds for an 'electronic' manual.
the 5d mark iii's power switch has been relocated to underneath the shooting mode this dial, much like on the canon eos 7d as well, and there's also the same multi-function button from the 7d too, positioned next to the shutter release button.
the 5d mark iii has an identical live view system to its predecessor.
there's a built-in microphone on the front of the camera for mono recording, a socket on the side for connecting an external stereo microphone, plus a headphone socket which enables sound level monitoring both during and after shooting.
the other methods, live af and live af with face detection, use an image contrast auto-focus system, much like that used by point-and shoot compacts, the main benefits being the complete lack of noise during operation, and no lcd blackout.
focusing is achieved via the af-on button, or you can half-press the shutter-button.
you can also take either single or continuous stills during recording, with video capture continuing after the final still frame has been taken.
this joystick works well enough, but it's not as positive or as easy to use as a conventional four-way controller.
it's a bit of an acquired taste compared to more conventional control dials, but you quickly get used to it and it is easy to 'spin'.
focusing manually is a much better idea, although most af lenses have mf rings with very little 'travel' between their close-focus point and infinity (the ef 24-105mm f/4l is is quite good in this regard), and in a quiet environment it's also possible to hear the sound of the focusing ring.
with most other dslr systems you'd have to send the camera and lens off for calibration (and maybe even have to pay for it), but with the 5d mark iii, you can calibrate all of your lenses in the comfort of your own home (up to 20 lenses can be stored in the camera).
handholding the eos 5d mark iii and shooting video is very difficult, with the dslr form factor not lending itself well to controlled shooting at arm's length.
the eos 5d mark iii features the latest digic 5+ image processor, which produces noticeably faster image processing, start-up and image review times than the 3-year old 5d me ii (as you'd expect), and better noise reduction in high-iso images (jump to theimage quality page for iso samples).
the new 5d mark iii records high-definition 1080p, wide-screen video in 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution, at a variable frame rate from 24fps to 60fps in mov format.
a continuous silent mode is also available, although its at a slower rate of 3fps than the headline 6fps mode.
significantly more expensive than the 5d mk ii on launch (£2999 / €3569.99 / $3499.95), read the full review to find out if the new canon eos 5d mark iii is a worthy successor to the camera that it replaces.
in-camera image rating via a new dedicated button on the rear makes it easy to organise your images ahead of post-production, with the rating maintained in iptc-friendly software.
this is important for canon, as some competitors image stabilisation that's built-in to the camera body.
depending on which shooting mode you're using, this lets you set various parameters via the lcd screen, using the joystick to move around the various options.
live view is also used for the feature that generated the most interest in the previous canon eos 5d mark ii: the 1080p movie mode.
if you're new to dslrs and don't understand the terminology, basically live view allows you to view the scene in front of you live on the lcd screen, rather than through the traditional optical viewfinder.
peripheral illumination correction is a feature that's actually a lot simpler that it initially sounds.
it's a much better idea to mount the camera on a dedicated video tripod.
peripheral illumination correction is a useful and effective addition, particularly for jpeg shooters, and can safely be left turned on all of the time.
on cheaper dslr cameras, the lcd on the rear usually has to do both jobs, but on this model all of the camera's main settings are visible from above on the smaller panel.
there's a dedicated lock switch which toggles this dial on and off.
basically it corrects the unwanted effects of vignetting, typically seen in wide-angle photos in the corners of the frame.
the 5d mark iii also shows the settings on the main lcd screen as well as the status lcd.
there's also a whole af menu dedicated to fine-tuning the 5d me iii's autofocus system, with a range of customisable af pre-sets helping you to deal with different subjects.
buy cheap cameras fromsony and canon.
the m-fn , or multi-function, button is a new addition to the top of the camera, which toggles through the five different af area choices after pressing the af point select button the af areas are manual af, spot af, af point expansion, automatic af point selection and zone af, and they can also be selected via the quick control screen menu.
no less, than 41 of them are cross-type points, with five being the extra sensitive double-cross type, helping to ensure that moving objects remain in focus.
the 24-105mm lens also crucially features image stabilisation.
for raw images the correction is applied later in the digital photo professional software.
the maximum size of a single video clip is either 4 gigabytes or one second below 30 minutes.
this allows you to alter the focus of each lens, then use a focusing target to test if the lens focuses correctly, and if it doesn't, alter it slightly using the af adjustment option, then test again until perfect focus is achieved.
it's also appealing to macro shooters, for example, as it's often easier to view the screen than look through the viewfinder when the camera is mounted on a tripod at an awkward angle.
on the front of the 5d mark iii is an infrared port on the grip, depth-of-field preview button, self-timer lamp and a monaural microphone.
you can now set the aperture and shutter speed from the camera in movie mode, and exposure compensation and ae-lock can also be used.
previously accessed on the 5d mark ii by pressing in the joystick, the quick control screen is particularly well-suited to beginners and tripod work.
the viewfinder has also been upgraded, now offering an improved 100% coverage to its predecessor’s 98%, with a magnification of 0.71x and dioptre correction.
admittedly, photographers who've graduated to a camera like this one will almost certainly have chosen image browsing and editing software already, so they won't need the basic image browsing program included here, but there's more than that.
unlike some competitors, there are no digital styles or effects that can be applied to an image after it has been taken - the more subtle picture styles are the only way of tweaking your jpegs in-camera, before they are captured.
it's also appealing to macro shooters, for example, as it's often easier to view the screen than look through the viewfinder when the camera is mounted on a tripod at an awkward angle.
only the complex custom functions and af menus detract a little from the overall usability.
the 5d mark iii is outwardly very similar to its predecessor, being very slightly bigger (152 x 116.4 x 76.4mm) and weighing 140g more (950g in total) than the mk ii.
read our detailed canon eos 5d mark iii review to find out.
only the complex custom functions and af menus detract a little from the overall usability.
the viewfinder displays all key exposure information including the iso speed, and there are four metering modes including a tighter 1.5% spot metering mode, useful in tricky lighting conditions as an alternative to the excellent and consistent evaluative metering system.
the eos 5d mark iii implements the same dust-removal technology as its predecessor, where the sensor is shaken briefly at high frequency to dislodge any dust particles from its surface.
this could delay the need for manual sensor cleaning, perhaps indefinitely, but it won't be able to remove 'sticky' deposits like salt spray, pollen or the smears left behind by careless sensor cleaning or the wrong kind of solvent.
pressing the creative photo button displays two images side-by-side to allow you to compare the quality of different exposures on the camera.
unfortunately these are much slower than the quick af mode, taking over 3 seconds to focus on a clearly-defined subject in bright light, which i think will put off most users that are attracted by the promised point-and-shoot experience.
handholding the eos 5d mark iii and shooting video is very difficult, with the dslr form factor not lending itself well to controlled shooting at arm's length.
importantly it also allows you to judge the critical sharpness of your photos using the lcd screen.
a continuous silent mode is also available, although its at a slower rate of 3fps than the headline 6fps mode.
there's a smaller fourth button which activates the status lcd display light so that you can use it in the dark.
the first, quick af, works by physically flipping the camera mirror to engage the auto-focus sensor, which then momentarily blanks the lcd screen and causes a physical sound, before the image is displayed after about 1 second.
live view is also used for the feature that generated the most interest in the previous canon eos 5d mark ii: the 1080p movie mode.
while experienced videographers will be writing our their cheques for the 5d mark iii right now, more casual users hoping to grab some quality footage of the kids may be put off by the inherent difficulties of shooting video using the relatively alien slr format.
this can then be deleted automatically after the shoot with the supplied digital photo professional software.
this joystick works well enough, but it's not as positive or as easy to use as a conventional four-way controller.
underneath is the new quick button which opens the quick control screen.
the main lcd screen offers a fantastic vga resolution with 1,040k dots, so you may find yourself using it more often than you thought.
if you're new to dslrs and don't understand the terminology, basically live view allows you to view the scene in front of you live on the lcd screen, rather than through the traditional optical viewfinder.
the eos 5d mark iii features a new silent shooting mode that reduces the sound of both the shutter and mirror, perfect for situations where you don't want to draw unwanted attention to yourself.
there is a new auto shooting mode aimed at beginners called scene intelligent auto, which effectively replaces the 5d mark ii's full auto and creative auto modes.
you do get a the manual in english throughout and you'll find most things that you need to know about the camera's operation in here, without the need to search through the supplied cds for an 'electronic' manual.
the main difference between canon (and nikon) and the other manufacturers is that sony (plus olympus and pentax) have opted for stabilisation via the camera body, rather than the lens, which therefore works with their entire range of lenses.
canon and nikon also claim that a lens-based anti-shake system is inherently better too, but the jury's out on that one.
it is simple to get a closer look at an image as you can zoom in up to 15 times, and it is also possible to view pictures in a set of nine contact sheet.
on the front of the 5d mark iii is an infrared port on the grip, depth-of-field preview button, self-timer lamp and a monaural microphone.
this is a big bonus, because other makers don't always include such good raw conversion software.
digic 5+ also allows the 5d mark iii to shoot a lot faster than the previous 5d model, obtaining a speed of 6fps for up to an incredible 16,000 full-sized jpegs with a udma 7 (ultra direct memory access) compact flash memory card or 18 raw images (the 5d could only shoot at 3.9fps).
basically it corrects the unwanted effects of vignetting, typically seen in wide-angle photos in the corners of the frame.
you can also still connect the 5d mark iii to a standard tv set via ntsc/pal.
the twin headline features are the 22 megapixel, full-frame cmos sensor, and the ability to record video at full 1080p high-definition.
this rear 'quick control dial' is characteristic of all high-end canon eos cameras, used to apply rapid exposure adjustments.
the maximum size of a single video clip is either 4 gigabytes or one second below 30 minutes.
this massive iso range allows you to shoot in almost any lighting conditions without having to resort to using flash, which is good news as the 5d mark iii doesn't actually have a built-in pop-up flash (you'll need to budget for an external flashgun).
14-bit a/d conversion, in-camera hdr processing, multiple exposure function and in-camera raw processing are also enabled by the digic 5+ processor.
canon's system is obviously limited by which lenses you choose, but it does offer the slight advantage of showing the stabilising effect through the viewfinder.
once you have captured a photo, the canon eos 5d mark iii has an average range of options for playing, reviewing and managing your images.
it is simple to get a closer look at an image as you can zoom in up to 15 times, and it is also possible to view pictures in a set of nine contact sheet.
you can also delete an image, rotate an image, view a slideshow, protect images so that they cannot be deleted, and set various printing options.
this massive iso range allows you to shoot in almost any lighting conditions without having to resort to using flash, which is good news as the 5d mark iii doesn't actually have a built-in pop-up flash (you'll need to budget for an external flashgun).
the 5d mark iii has a magnesium alloy body, which should make it more durable in the longer term than plastic-bodied cameras, and it also adds a welcome level of weather-proofing for protection against dust and moisture.
the other methods, live af and live af with face detection, use an image contrast auto-focus system, much like that used by point-and shoot compacts, the main benefits being the complete lack of noise during operation, and no lcd blackout.
the 5d mark iii also shows the settings on the main lcd screen as well as the status lcd.
it uses the industry-standard hdmi mini-out connection, but note that you'll need to purchase a suitable cable separately.
on cheaper dslr cameras, the lcd on the rear usually has to do both jobs, but on this model all of the camera's main settings are visible from above on the smaller panel.
the quick control dial does take up the space where you'd normally expect to find a four-way controller, which means that for menu navigation canon has had to incorporate an additional small joystick on the back of the camera.
14-bit a/d conversion, in-camera hdr processing, multiple exposure function and in-camera raw processing are also enabled by the digic 5+ processor.
the menu system is the same as on most eos cameras, utilising a simplified tab structure that does away completely with scrolling.
the viewfinder has also been upgraded, now offering an improved 100% coverage to its predecessor’s 98%, with a magnification of 0.71x and dioptre correction.
battery life is rated to cipa standards at 950 shots using the viewfinder, or 200 shots in live view mode.
highlight alert and af point display can also be turned on via the playback menu.
scene intelligent auto allows you to change just a few key settings using the lcd screen, setting both the aperture and shutter speed for you.
this is important for canon, as some competitors image stabilisation that's built-in to the camera body.
new high bit-rate video compression options include intraframe (all-i) and interframe (ipb).
for raw images the correction is applied later in the digital photo professional software.
once the eos 5d mark iii is in one of the 'creative zones', users can adjust the iso setting into one of 12 positions from 50 to 102,400 (you need to to enable the iso 50, 52000 and 102,400 modes via the "iso expansion" custom function option).
front rear like most dslrs aimed at prosumers, the eos 5d mark iii offers all the usual serious manual and semi-automatic shooting modes for users who want more advanced exposure control, via a chunky and positive dial on the top-left of the camera body (now with a central lock button to prevent the dial from inadvertently moving).
underneath is the new quick button which opens the quick control screen.
i tested the eos 5d mark iii with the popular ef 24-105mm f/4l is lens, which is offered as a kit lens in some regions.
this can be doubled by using the optional bg-e11 battery grip which takes two batteries.
the 5d mark iii's power switch has been relocated to underneath the shooting mode this dial, much like on the canon eos 7d as well, and there's also the same multi-function button from the 7d too, positioned next to the shutter release button.
a grid line display, new dual-axis electronic level and very useful live histogram can be enabled to help with composition and exposure, and you can zoom in by up to 10x magnification of the image displayed on the lcd screen.
with most other dslr systems you'd have to send the camera and lens off for calibration (and maybe even have to pay for it), but with the 5d mark iii, you can calibrate all of your lenses in the comfort of your own home (up to 20 lenses can be stored in the camera).

the menu system is the same as on most eos cameras, utilising a simplified tab structure that does away completely with scrolling.
you can even setup your own customised menu page for instant access to frequently used settings via the my menu setting.
there is also 720p 1280x720 pixel recording at 50/60 fps.
you also get canon's simple but effective photostitch application for making panoramic shots, a utility for using the 5d mark iii remotely (while tethered to a pc) and canon's digital photo professional application for converting raw files.
this could delay the need for manual sensor cleaning, perhaps indefinitely, but it won't be able to remove 'sticky' deposits like salt spray, pollen or the smears left behind by careless sensor cleaning or the wrong kind of solvent.
this can be doubled by using the optional bg-e11 battery grip which takes two batteries.
you can take a single/sequence of still shots whilst shooting video, but this causes a 1 second delay which you'll need to edit out later.
previously accessed on the 5d mark ii by pressing in the joystick, the quick control screen is particularly well-suited to beginners and tripod work.

the 5d mark iii contains a database of correction data for various canon lenses and, if peripheral illumination correction is enabled, automatically applies it to jpeg images.
that concludes our tour of the canon eos 5d mark iii's interface - now let's take a look at its image quality.
there's a built-in microphone on the front of the camera for mono recording, a socket on the side for connecting an external stereo microphone, plus a headphone socket which enables sound level monitoring both during and after shooting.
