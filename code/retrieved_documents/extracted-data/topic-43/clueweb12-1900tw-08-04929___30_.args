the 35mm lens is very inexpensive and delivers superb image quality on a dx body.i have found the 85mm f/1.8 to be an excellent portrait lens (better than the 50mm f/1.8) and coupled with the 35mm f/1.8, it would provide me the capabilities of indoor low-light snapshots and group pictures (thus eliminating the need for a dedicated 50mm prime).the 16-85 is a superb lens for landscape, travel, outdoor photography, and group photos with good light.it is not the best lens in the world, but is good enough for most photography needs.the 18-105 produces excellent image quality according to most reviews and for a casual shooter, that should be enough given the price difference.the 18-200mm vrii is a very popular lens for obvious reasons, but if changing lenses is not a hinderance, there are other cost effective options (e.g., 18-55 and 55-200) that give better end results.the nikon 50mm f/1.4g is a great lens that i use more than any other and it will serve you well for the type of photography you want to do… hope this helps.the nikon 50mm f/1.4g is newer and certainly sharper than the 50mm f/1.4d, especially when shooting at maximum aperture.50mm f/1.4 is a great lens and will serve you well for portraits.she loves the fact that the lens is very compact, light and yet produces stunningly beautiful images.the 18-200 is an excellent lens for someone who wants the convenience of a larger zoom range with vrii, doesn’t want to change lenses and risk dust on the sensor.in my experience, the sensor will collect dust eventually after years of use anyway, and a advanced amateur photographer has to have the tools and know-how to clean the dust by his own.the f/1.2 is a great lens, but the manual focus is something i was never comfortable with, especially when dealing with large apertures between f/1.2 and f/2.8…the nikon 50mm f/1.4g is an excellent lens.it is very sharp and works great for low-light environments.
