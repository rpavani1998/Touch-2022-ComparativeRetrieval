so far, it looks very promising.
while absolute  resolution is always a big plus, a fine print requires high quality pixels, not  just high resolution.
so why did i buy a 2nd 5d?
when the 1d mark iii becomes available, i’ll switch to the combination of 1d mark iii + 5d-ir, and sell the unmodified color eos 5d. contact me in late june 2007 if interested in the unmodified canon 5d. to be clear, nikon’s offerings at the low and medium end are excellent (if you can call cameras from $500 to $1600 “low end”).
dslr leadership might well  change in 2010, but nikon’s offerings are top of the heap as i write  this, with canon clearly lagging.
the17-55 f/2.8 dx and 28-70 f/2.8  af-s are both outstanding, but they are bulky and heavy and only f/2.8.
but i’m tired of waiting—if it’s this month at photokina, that won’t be too late, but beyond that nikon gets punted to my shit-list.
all the good things with nikon remain true (which i cover in great detail in d2x vs eos).
the35mm f/1.4l is outperformed by zooms in the corners, though otherwise excellent.
the 12.8-megapixel canon eos 5d beats the nikond200 (though not the d2x) —with higher contrast too.
nikon is at great risk of becoming a has-been in the  professional market, a sad development, and one that is equally bad for canon  users; canon needs a wolf nipping at its heels, as does nikon.
pushing the envelope of both resolution and features, along with  outstanding new optics, canon is the new horse i’ll be riding with the  arrival of my on-ordercanon eos 1d mark iii, while looking forward to a  22-megapixel (rumored) canon eos 1ds mark iii.
canon’s 135mm f/2l is optically outstanding, and it autofocuses  accurately and instantly, quite unlike nikon’s dated and clunky135mm f/2  dc, which has specially-bred chipmunks living inside to turn the focusing  mechanism.

the nikon d200 doesn’t  just compare favorably to the canon 5d, it surpasses it in build quality,  having a sealed body, larger and easier to use buttons and other positive  characteristics (seed2x vs eos and d200 vs d2x).
so far, it looks very  promising.
by comparison, canon has produced an improved 85mm f/1.2l ii, and an all-new 50mm f/1.2l; these two are uniquely “fast” and optically stellar.

another $125 is no big deal if you’ve bought  a d2x, but if you’ve gone with the $500 d40, then another $125 is a very  stiff premium indeed.
a february  2007 experience with an outdoor portrait reminded me how awful the results can  be, but the conditions which cause it elude me.
the d200 viewfinder offers an excellent viewfinder for a “dx”  camera, but i’ve come around to the view of many—ilike the  full-frame view of the canon eos models (for most subjects at least).

the d200 seems better, but i’ve concluded that canon focus is simply more accurate (note: i haven’t proven this with objective testing, so it’s only my working theory).
