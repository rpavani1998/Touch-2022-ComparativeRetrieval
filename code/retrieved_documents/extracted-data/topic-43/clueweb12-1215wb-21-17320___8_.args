nikon strives to provide photographers with excellent picture taking performance, compatible nikon in-system image processing performance and by extension, compatibility with additional software developers' products, with the ultimate goal of delivering a high level of integrity for a photographer's creative vision.nikon's camera system, nef and capture software are a tightly knit system, and they are all developed through the cooperative efforts of nikon's design teams, and this collaboration results in achieving the highest image quality.with the nikon sdk, developers may design excellent and creative compatibility between the nef and their software, all without compromising the integrity of the nef's original concept, and ensuring that work done by the photographer during the picture taking process can be incorporated into the rendering of the image."...design excellent and creative compatibility"?securing this structure is intended for the photographer's benefit, and dedicated to ensuring faithful reproduction of the photographer's creative intentions through consistent performance and rendition of the images.the nikon d2x is capable of producing high quality images that can be saved in a variety of file formats, including the proprietary nikon electronic format (nef), standard tiff and several levels of standard jpeg compressed files.at the same time, nikon makes available a software developer kit (sdk) that, when implemented appropriately, enables a wide range of nef performance, including white balance, for nikon photographers and their productive use of the nef file.nikon responds, and as a marketing person, i don't know whether to be in awe or contempt of their attempt to clarify their position while saying absolutely nothing: the nikon d2x professional digital single lens reflex camera has received widely positive acclaim for its overall performance and image processing quality.compatibility between the nef and their software, all without compromising the integrity of the nef's original concept, and ensuring that work done by the photographer during the picture taking process can be incorporated into the rendering of the image.i think of the countless hours i've spent dealing with spam in both e-mail and on my blog, and how many millions of people have done the same, and it's all so that a relatively small community of pathologically sleazy people can make a little bit of money.they say the event would desecrate the city and convey the erroneous impression that homosexuality is acceptable.nikon photographers reap benefits from independent developers' approaches, because it allows the photographer to open and process their nef images.nikon's preservation of its unique technology in the nef file is employed as an action that protects the uniqueness of the file.with each introduction of a new nikon digital single lens reflex model, nikon updates the available sdk selection to provide new information; this is the situation with the d2x, d2hs and d50 models.oh, so it's for photographers' own good that nikon won't let them read the data in their photographs?nikon wants developers to license an sdk in order to be able to access certain information in the pictures that users create.
