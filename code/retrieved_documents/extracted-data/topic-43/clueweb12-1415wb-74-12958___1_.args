as these high-end cameras become more complex, and quality-control becomes more and more of an issue, professionals will need to demand more from nikon and canon, and stop tolerating poor workmanship and performance.that capability would simply change everything we do with a camera and offer up a new world of light.at this level, lens diffraction will be a major issue, especially for nature photography where one wants greater depth of field.and yes, a good camera will produce better images, even though the key ingredient is always the photographer and the photographer’s skills.the 5d mark ii offers the photographer a 21.1 megapixel camera with a full-frame sensor and something entirely new, hd movies!with outstanding image quality, it is difficult to pass up, particularly if the price for it drops in the next six months, and likely it will when its replacement is announced.it has one great advantage over the nikon d3x, and that is sensor cleaning.at 21.1 megapixels it is a tad shy of the nikon d3x offering, but it has been around for a good while and the images it produces are equal, in my opinon, to the new nikon offering.when one travels and when one enters into the real world of nature photography, the affects of weather on equipment is paramount.the real market for both the d3x and the 1ds mark iii, is not nature photographers, it is the professional photographer who does studio work, weddings, or the sports shooters and newspaper reporters who use the camera on a daily basis.wow, it may offer those of us who do both landscapes and wildlife photography a great resource.like the nikon, it is a professional grade camera.at first blush, the nikon d3x sounds like the answer, giving the photographer the option of shooting full-frame or a reduced sized shot at higher speeds.nikon’s announcement of this camera is receiving lots of interest by serious photographers.in other words, it’s better than its sibling, but not yet a professional grade camera.
