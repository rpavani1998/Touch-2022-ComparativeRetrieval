regarding the grip problem on the canon s90 and s95, camera leathers in the usa have cut panels in a very thin self-adhesive material to cover the s90 and are working on the same for the s95.
the nikon coolpix p300 features a normal sized 12 megapixel back lit cmos sensor that you would find  in many other compact cameras (such as thenikon coolpix s9100), an f/1.8 - 4.9  wide angle lens starting at 24mm equivalent, and a high resolution 3 inch  screen with 920k pixels.
while the nikon coolpix p300 is the fastest shooting with a backlit cmos sensor  and 8fps shooting, and also offers the highest resolution video.
detail on the canon powershot s95 shots are very good.
the panasonic lumix lx5 is the  largest of the three, as can be seen most clearly when viewed from the top, but  is also the most advanced, offering a uniquely shaped 10 megapixel ccd sensor  that supports multiple aspect ratios, a flash hot shoe, an slr style command  wheel, large hand grip, and a bright lens at both wide angle and telephoto,  that starts at 24mm equivalent.
these panels are black and textured to give a better grip.

the nikon coolpix p300 with smaller sensor produces good results, better than some expected thanks to the backlit cmos sensor, and extremely rapid performance in the form of 8fps shooting, high speed video and full hd video recording, and is thereforehighly recommended (and a close second).

we decided to compare three of the most compact serious cameras to find  out how they perform, and what they offer that makes them worth parting with  your cold hard cash for.
the p300 produced the warmest colours, with lots of red-eye.
continuous shooting (at full resolution)
this is followed by the p300 with a close focusing distance of 3cm and  excellent detail, with the s95 faring the worst in this test, only allowing you  to focus on subjects 5cm away from the lens.
to test this we took 6 or more shots and calculated the average, so that consistent results were produced, we also made sure to test all the cameras at the same time to ensure the cameras were being tested under the same conditions.

the nikon coolpix p300 packs almost every feature  imaginable and then prices it less than the competition!
it does mean extra cost though.
the panasonic lumix lx5 is a serious compact with excellent image  quality and is a brilliant choice for the serious photographer.
all of the cameras are capable of producing excellent images, especially when compared to standard point and shoot cameras, however the strengths and weaknesses are what sets these cameras apart.
where the nikon difference comes, is in the high speed 8fps shooting and full hd video recording.
light red: worst, grey: second best,  green: best.
detail is very good on the p300 shot, although it is possible to see sharpening artefacts.
portrait shots  with flash nikon coolpix p300 canon powershot s95 panasonic  lumix lx5 portrait with flash portrait with flash portrait  with flash the s95 flash seemed to overexpose the image  slightly, this was made worse by the screen on the back showing the image as  brighter than it actually was, and the shot also shows the worst red-eye of the  three cameras.
video performance: the lx5 has the  most control over video, but also offers only monochrome sound, while the s95  and p300 both feature stereo sound.
the three cameras provide a wide range of features, and go to show that the  digital camera market is alive and well, with interesting, innovative, and  competitive products, with each model differencing itself enough to make each  camera worthy of your attention depending on your needs.
the s95 is not necessarily slow, however, in this  competition it is noticeable that it scores as the slowest camera of the three,  apart from shutter response which seemed the quickest (just).
the canon offers a  clever dial around the lens, raw support and customisable buttons.
switching to the portrait scene mode produces softer skin, and removes red-eye  from the subject (an example is shown in the full review).
the s95 shows the softest results in these tests, as though the noise reduction  settings are set too high.

as an owner of the s95, i got around the "lack of optical zoom while recording videos," by using the custom firmware chdk hack allowing optical zooming and manual focus.
the canon powershot s95 provided around 200 shots in real use, which matches the cipa rating.
handling hopefully the specifications and features of each camera has given you an idea of what each of these cameras offers, but it all becomes quite mute if the cameras are unable to offer the speed and image quality to back it up.

i have not worked without an external flash for 40 years, and i already have an olympus fl-36r, so the prices match, and the olympus work i have seen has inspired me more than the work folk have posted from the panasonic.
we have broken down the main features into an easy to read table, showing the best highlighted in green.
twitter facebook google+ rss reach 960k+ photographers; advertise on epz related buyers guides top 11 best dslrs here are the top 11 best dslrs reviewed by us on ephotozine.
2fps (~) each camera excels at something, most  noticeably the p300 with the fastest start up time, and fastest continuous  shooting (by a long shot).
iso100 here you can see the difference between having a 24mm equivalent lens and a  28mm equivalent lens, with the s95 in the middle showing less of the scene than  the others.
isn't it obvious, that nikon p300 image quality is crap compared to the other two, or is it just me ?
it's worth noting that the iso range of the p300 is the lowest, ranging from iso160 to iso3200, the s95 goes from iso80 - 3200, while the lx5 goes from iso80 upto iso3200 at full resolution, with iso6400, and iso12800 available at 3mp.
read our full canon powershot s95 review.
it offers excellent image quality thanks to the brilliant 24mm leica f/2.0 lens, larger than standard ccd sensor, and reliable image processing which can be seen in the superb auto white balance performance, and noise results.
the p300 follows on from that, producing warm, rich colours, while the s95 produces the warmest colours of all with a yellow shift to the image.
only this camera currently gives this as the lx5 is much larger and the canon s95 only goes to 28mm.

i own sony a700 & a55 dslrs and previously owned the canon s90, so a lot to live up to in the image quality stakes.
i suppose as with many compacts there may be some artifacts magnified very closely but this would be like trying to make 6ft x 4ft posters from it, in other words in the real world the images look superb.

nikon p300 vs canon s95 vs panasonic lx5 verdict
the sensor is smaller than both the lx5 or s95 so i was nervous about making this purchase but nikon have worked wonders with the backlit sensor and low light results are amazing.
we have broken down the main features  into an easy to read table, showing the best highlighted in green.
the build quality is exceptional.
unless something has drastically changed from the s90, i don't see this as an issue at all.
in other words, there aren't really any negatives about the s95.

the nikon coolpix p300 is  the cheapest, from £249, while thecanon powershot s95, is around  £299, and thepanasonic lumix lx5 is the most expensive of the  three, at around £349.
to get a feel for these advanced compacts i borrowed a canon s90, and i am surprised that a quick-reaction firm like canon has not addressed certain shortcomings of the s90, like not having a hot-shoe, when designing the s95.
well spotted, i'll fix the typo.
all of the  cameras are capable of producing excellent images, especially when compared to  standard point and shoot cameras, however the strengths and weaknesses are what  sets these cameras apart.
click images to very larger versions.
the canon  is the smallest with full manual support, including raw, but unfortunately  suffers from the lowest battery life, least grip-able body, and doesn't allow  the use of optical zoom in videos, however, if you need the smallest camera  with manual controls it's worth a look.
the canon offers a clever dial around the lens, raw support and customisable buttons.
performance here we've tested each camera in the real world, and in studio tests, taking photos with each camera, at the same time under the same lighting conditions so that you can directly compare them.

unfortunately the camera lacks raw support, which could put some people off this camera, as you will have to trust the jpeg results straight from the camera.
read our full panasonic lumix lx5 review.
the s95 shows the softest results in these tests, as though the noise reduction settings are set too high.
the s95 is not necessarily slow, however, in this competition it is noticeable that it scores as the slowest camera of the three, apart from shutter response which seemed the quickest (just).
nikon p300 panasonic lx5 canon s95 shutter reponse <0.1 <0.1 <0.1 wide - focus and shutter response average 0.4 0.3 0.4 full zoom - focus and shutter response average 0.5 0.3 0.45 switch on time to taking a photo 1.3 1.8 1.9 shot to shot (without flash) 1.4 0.9 (2 shots) 2.1 shot to shot with flash 2.6 1.6 (2 shots) 3.0 (2 shots)
the panels for the s90 cost $12.95 plus postage, so not excessive.
further to this is features a well laid out menu system with an abundance of options, including numerous video options, and comes with a leather neck strap.
may be this is just jpeg compression artifacts ?
we decided to compare three of the most compact serious cameras to find out how they perform, and what they offer that makes them worth parting with your cold hard cash for.
the  camera gives great expansion potential thanks to the flash hot-shoe, and  rear accessory port.
the nikon coolpix p300 with smaller  sensor produces good results, better than some expected thanks to the backlit  cmos sensor, and extremely rapid performance in the form of 8fps shooting, high  speed video and full hd video recording, and is thereforehighly  recommended (and a close second).
also camera menu allows custom color settings for increasing sharpness and saturation giving a little better image quality.
is that the opposite of color sound?
the panasonic lx5 is the most flexible and advanced with support for hot-shoe, and produces the highest quality images.

outside shots nikon coolpix p300 canon powershot s95 panasonic lumix lx5 iso160 iso100 iso100 here the nikon has produced the warmest most vibrant colours, followed by the panasonic lumix lx5, which has produced the most life like colours, while the canon has produced slightly cooler colours.
the p300 and lx5 both feature dedicated video record buttons and let you use the optical zoom while recording, while the s95 only has digital zoom while recording.
all your comparisons definitely show the 3 cameras are better at different things and that one camera is not completely perfect.
how the strengths and weaknesses  apply to you depends on what you want from a camera, and if you want the  smallest camera of the three, then the most obvious choice is the canon  powershot s95.
i guess my fingers have superb grip.
the lx5 is to be commended for excellent focusing  speed, and general all round quick performance, whilst not as quick as the  p300, the 2.5fps continuous shooting is still adequate, and the rest of the  performance figures are good.

the panasonic lumix lx5 is  an excellent example of how to get a digital camera right, and really sets the  benchmark when it comes to the serious compact camera.
the three cameras provide a wide range of features, and go to show that the digital camera market is alive and well, with interesting, innovative, and competitive products, with each model differencing itself enough to make each camera worthy of your attention depending on your needs.
the panasonic lumix lx5 is a serious compact with excellent image quality and is a brilliant choice for the serious photographer.
the canon powershot s95 is the most compact and features a larger than normal 10 megapixel ccd sensor, an f/2.0 - 4.9 wide angle lens starting at 28mm equivalent, and again a high resolution 3 inch screen.

this is a good review, and it's nce to see manufacturers looking at other matters as well as pixel count.

it offers excellent  image quality thanks to the brilliant 24mm leica f/2.0 lens, larger than  standard ccd sensor, and reliable image processing which can be seen in the  superb auto white balance performance, and noise results.
detail is very good on the  p300 shot, although it is possible to see sharpening artefacts.
it's worth noting that the iso range of the p300 is  the lowest, ranging from iso160 to iso3200, the s95 goes from iso80 - 3200,  while the lx5 goes from iso80 upto iso3200 at full resolution, with iso6400,  and iso12800 available at 3mp.
it would be mighty difficult to separate lx5 from xz-1 without that comparison.
this is followed by the p300 with a close focusing distance of 3cm and excellent detail, with the s95 faring the worst in this test, only allowing you to focus on subjects 5cm away from the lens.
i have brought this camera and the results are superb.

unfortunately that size comes at a price, and the most noticeable downsides to the s95's size is the lowest battery life, rated at 200 shots, the camera's slippery when held, and the lack of optical zoom while recording videos.
switching to the portrait scene mode produces softer skin, and removes red-eye from the subject (an example is shown in the full review).
excellent review - exactly the three cameras i was comparing myself.
performance here we've tested each camera in the real world, and in  studio tests, taking photos with each camera, at the same time under the same  lighting conditions so that you can directly compare them.
the build quality is exceptional.
the p300 follows on from that, producing warm, rich  colours, while the s95 produces the warmest colours of all with a yellow shift  to the image.
battery life (cipa)* 240 200 400 price £249 £299 £349 * our own testing found the nikon coolpix p300 offered better battery life than this in use, while the panasonic lumix lx5 battery life was more often around 280 shots.

the p300 produces an image that has a slightly  yellow tone to it, however colour is very good.
detail on the  canon powershot s95 shots are very good.
light red: worst, grey: second best, green: best.
with two of them the strengths are most obvious, with  another, the weaknesses are the most apparent.
iso100 the lx5 allows you to photograph your subject when it is just 1cm in front of the lens, producing excellent results.
the canon is the smallest with full manual support, including raw, but unfortunately suffers from the lowest battery life, least grip-able body, and doesn't allow the use of optical zoom in videos, however, if you need the smallest camera with manual controls it's worth a look.

lens performance (telephoto zoom)
unfortunately the  camera lacks raw support, which could put some people off this camera, as you  will have to trust the jpeg results straight from the camera.

iso100 here you can see the difference between having a 24mm equivalent lens and a 28mm equivalent lens, with the s95 in the middle showing less of the scene than the others.

last modified bygonson at 13 sep 2011 - 6:16 am also, i don't understand the fuss about the grip of the canon s95.
how the strengths and weaknesses apply to you depends on what you want from a camera, and if you want the smallest camera of the three, then the most obvious choice is the canon powershot s95.
iso100 the p300 and s95 zoomed in has very  similar telephoto reach, with the s95 zooming the furthest to an equivalent of  105mm.
the p300 offered the softest results, with the stronger contrast causing detail to be lost in the shadow areas of images.

category: digital cameras rating: panasonic lx5 vs canon s95 vs nikon p300 - three of the latest and most compact serious cameras from panasonic, nikon and canon put to the test by joshua waller.
comments from people who have not had both cameras for long enough to present a body of work are unreliable in this extremely finely balanced case.
the panasonic lumix lx5 is the largest of the three, as can be seen most clearly when viewed from the top, but is also the most advanced, offering a uniquely shaped 10 megapixel ccd sensor that supports multiple aspect ratios, a flash hot shoe, an slr style command wheel, large hand grip, and a bright lens at both wide angle and telephoto, that starts at 24mm equivalent.
the reviewer also mentioned the low battery life as an issue.
the lx5 is to be commended for excellent focusing speed, and general all round quick performance, whilst not as quick as the p300, the 2.5fps continuous shooting is still adequate, and the rest of the performance figures are good.
handling hopefully the specifications and features of each camera has  given you an idea of what each of these cameras offers, but it all becomes  quite mute if the cameras are unable to offer the speed and image quality to  back it up.
to address the point about the canon's handling, there is a guy in the usa called richard franiec who makes an add-on grip for the s95 (and it's predecessor, the s90, which i have) which works really well and improves the handling a lot.
the panasonic lx5 is the most flexible and  advanced with support for hot-shoe, and produces the highest quality images.

a very balanced and useful review with pertinent information and examples.
finally, the hotshoe issue?

the lx5 gave the most detail, with the lowest red-eye of the three.
the nikon coolpix p300 packs almost every feature imaginable and then prices it less than the competition!
2fps (~) each camera excels at something, most noticeably the p300 with the fastest start up time, and fastest continuous shooting (by a long shot).
