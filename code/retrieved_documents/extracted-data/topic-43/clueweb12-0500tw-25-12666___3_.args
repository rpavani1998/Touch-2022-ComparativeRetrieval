full-frame cameras, by virtue of their large sensors, have much better low-light performance, color rendition, dynamic range (the range of levels it can show between highlight and shadow) than their aps-c cousins.a 36 megapixel imaging monster, this camera delivers almost every conceivable video option and then some.improved metering which allows better scene recognition, including face detection.cameras in this bracket have virtually identical image quality (iq).it had great video shooting capabilities-something that its competitor- the nikon d700 completely lacked; a higher megapixel sensor, and was overall lighter than the d700.you also tend to get shallower depth of field for the same aperture on a full-frame than on an aps-c camera.- improved metering which allows better scene recognition, including face detection.a full-frame sensor (36mm x 24mm) has the same physical dimensions as 35mm film.this makes it much better in terms of quickly turning on the camera and shooting.it’s specifications list is quite impressive: 36.3 megapixel full frame cmos sensor.the d700 did have a superior autofocus (af) system, but that was really about it.the differences are more for their handling and features over and above great iq.it’s specifications list is quite impressive: - 36.3 megapixel full frame cmos sensor.most consumer dslrs have smaller sensors, called aps-c sensors (25mm x 16mm, which stands for advanced photo system type-classic).
