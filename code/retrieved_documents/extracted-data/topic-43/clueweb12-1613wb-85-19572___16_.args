the nikon af system is also much more reliable when shooting stationary subjects using servo focus.the d3 is the most versatile 35mm camera on the market right now and for the photographer that shoots a little bit of everything, it’s damn close to perfect.though i irrationally fear the d3 might tip over, the slightly smaller footprint gives the camera a pleasant weight distribution that does not shift when moving between landscape and portrait orientations.the d700 is a better camera in almost every single regard except for resolution and video capability.so far i have found the d700 features highly adjustable and i do look forward to what i feel is more accurate metering and flash system that nikon provides.the best thing about all of these camera bodies is how similar they are in terms of performance and features.though the 1d3 was no slouch above 1600 and there is little quantitative difference between the two cameras in terms of noise levels, the advantages of the d3 are clear to even the most casual of viewers at no more than 25% magnification.i have never had a camera that can focus so quickly and stay focused no matter the situation.in fact, there are so few unacceptably focused images from the d3 that the new camera has actually made it harder to finish editing.a number of professional photographers i know much prefered the original 580ex to the mark ii because they felt that the original was more durable.while the d3 has a measurable advantage over the canon in terms of noise, saturation, and dynamic range at high isos, the difference is fairly small.above iso 1600 d3 images processed with nikon capture nx 2 seem sharper, lower noise and move vibrant than those of the 1d3 processed with either canon digital picture professional or adobe lightroom.the 1d3 has a large squarish grip that inspires confidence despite feeling heavier on the left side of the camera than the right.the exposure is extremely accurate and the character of the light is amazing.if you’re taking a lot of portraits in low light, then the d700 and the right lenses will definitely focus more accurately than the 5dmk2.
