that makes india one of the world's fastest-growing markets for such cameras, at a time when camera sales are stagnating in the west and japan.one of the biggest advantages of using a dslr is that it lets the user choose from a variety of interchangeable lenses.the "proper camera" was a digital slr, or single lens reflex, camera, which offers a far more accurate preview of framing compared with point-and-shoot cameras.salian and sathyu are part of a growing tribe of indians, professional and amateur, who are splurging on dslr cameras like never before, thanks to their high disposable incomes."technology has made photography much easier," says salian who has shot numerous bollywood stars, including his favourite dimple kapadia before the release of saagar in 1984.but to his 68-year-old mother, who has always had a caustic tongue, the photographs were "slightly blurred" and lacked "character".another rs 750 crore comes from selling interchangeable lenses and accessories.this is an efficient option for those looking for safety of corpus and relatively higher returns.after experimenting with his wife's digital camera and consulting an artist friend who suggested he buy a "proper camera", sathyu walked into anikon shop in mumbai and bought a nikon d3100, plus a few lenses, that cost around rs 50,000.while nikon models are in the range of rs 32,950 to rs 5 lakh, canon's is a tad less than nikon's.between them, the two companies sell almost 99% of the dslr cameras that indians buy.an exemption no taxpayer can avail of given the restrictions, it is unlikely that anybody will be able to avail of the exemption from filing returns.he says in the rs 4,500-crore indian camera market, dslr cameras account for rs 750 crore.renowned mumbai-based fashion photographer ashok salian also swears by dslr cameras.olympus | nikon india | nikon | kodak | itouch | dslr | cybermedia research | canon india | canon tweet last year, when pune-based techie ravi sathyu uploaded his newly born son's pictures on facebook, he got around 150 "likes".
