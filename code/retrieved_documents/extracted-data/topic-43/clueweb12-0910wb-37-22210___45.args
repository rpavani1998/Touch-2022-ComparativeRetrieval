the new olly will compare really well against the nex-7, especially being weatherproof, if it’s $50 cheaper.
i’m in the market for a smaller system and have the funds for both the nex7 and om-d. to me the nex7 seems like a gearhead’s wishlist camera.
also much of the development cost (lenses, system) has already been paid back over the last couple years.
geek is the kind of guy you dread getting stuck next to at a party.
i have no clue if the x pro 1 will sell well with that price.
* some improvement in high iso performance * built-in evf * faster/tracking af at some 6fps * still a small/compact system * better button lay-out * not too expensive * built-in flash that can control other flashes * better battery than in the e-p3 that’s it.
still considerably cheaper than the fuji.
i have no clue if the x pro 1 will sell well with that price.
the fuji looks very nice, and i would have seriously considered if this would be my first or second system.
ive use many…doesnt make any difference i could take professionnal architectural shot with a low mp camera.
my point is that characterizing the om-d as a “rumored enthusiast point-and-shoot” is shortsighted and a troll-like comment….
along the sony nex-7 ($1200) this will become the main competitor of the olympus om-d which rumored price is around $1100.
but i see the advantage of introducing the new sensor technology with a more professional product.
i think $1100 will be body only price.
muahahahahahha man you are annoying.
it’s nice because normally lens-size is a big factor even for slr, and that limits things.
you speak of the difficulty to compare a rumoured camera to an existing camera, but in the same sentence you call the rumoured camera an enthusiast point & shoot.
i want the best camera for the images i want to make, and i want it to be comfortable, intuitive, light, and reliable.
the gx-1 has gotten good reviews, and a “gx pro” with a built-in evf and a few other goodies surely couldn’t be too much of a stretch for them… panny will make a gh3, with weatherproofing.
the price is just not fair, all people wanted was an x100 without bugs and the ability to take off the built in lens and change it.
these are credible people to have been given the opportunity.
i take photographs, not fauxtographs like you micro four turdists!
it gives full functionality with decent external control and most most importantly way better image quality than any m43 currently in market.
i think the om-d will have less height and have proportions similar to classic om cameras.
i see lovely printed images from small sensors such as m4/3 in magazines all the time (japanese enthusiast mags like camera life, f5.6, etc).
the 4/3 system needs better sensors.
this is the only weather sealed m4/3 lens and the only powered olympus lens.
the oly should be happy if the fuji deigns to cast it’s shadow upon it so that it may say it has been touched by greatness.
they certainly have the capability to design and build any kind of camera that they think will sell, and they can’t help having noticed that there’s money to be made here.
fact is, for the vast majority of people any camera made since, oh, 2004 or so is indeed “good enough”.
the camera feels clumsy.
i ask because i don’t see the point of putting a plastic lens on a a premium body.
as all newer m43 cameras start at iso160 or iso200 that means that a m43 can give good enough quality just on base iso setting.
i will agree, however, that the fuji and olympus have the same “flexibility.”
well, at least it leaves something to be desired and it will be a good reason to upgrade to the next x camera.
i might even prefer it over the leica s2 (my current favorite, for that enviorment) do to fuji’s ruggedest and portability.
i hope the om-d comes close to that simplicity, although it’s harder because you won’t have aperture dials on the lenses.
people who consider the fuji wouldn’t have considered a mft in the first place i think.
there is no competition, the fuji wins hands down.
again….we do not know the history of these files so i am hoping that i have just not seen a clean raw file from a capable photographer.
full frames are selliing around $2000 right now, because they are already 3 years old.
lenses are available too at amazon (click here), adorama (click here) and bhphoto (click here).
same iq, less weight and less cumbersome and 200$ less, less gimmicky controls, i’ll take one if the focus is fast enough !
later in the year we’ll get a rf styled “grf” to compete with the nex-7.
i have compared several controlled shots from the gf1 against the 7d and concluded that it falls short.
i was thinking about getting the gx1 to replace my aging gf1, and was intrigued by x pro 1 and om-d. however, x pro 1 is simply too expensive for a non-micro 4/3 camera, and while its image quality may be superior, i might be better off buyinga dslr.
me, i’m more concerned with image quality and low noise performance.
i, for example will never compromise on image quality.
not to undermine the small system because both can do some serious photography, just differently.
many ppl are complaining about the sample images from x-pro1.
newer offerings from nikon, canon, sony will cost $3000 (body only).
$1500-$1700 is still the semi pro zone and this is where, i think the om-d ( with lens) should be priced with its weather sealing, and magnesium body.
yes, but after plane fare to australia cameras are cheap.
you obviously can think of no new material.
it, ie., omg, will have to convince me why i should not buy another nex-7 and instead the omg.
the fuji will have better iq (dr + high iso) than the om-d (larger sensor + no aa filter.
sony a 77+ mirror less nex7 and the up coming pentax and ,leica.
we actually have something in common: neither of us knows what olympus will offer in the coming days.
they will make this camera.
you make it fairly clear what type of photographer you are when you quote wanting “better dxomark scores” as the reason for a new camera, rather than better images.
to me , x pro is true premier mirrorless camera that challenge the dslr without doubt that oly / pana failed to achieve so far .
the farther away the price of the omd is from the fuji, the less fuji is a contender.
it has plus and minus points, but in terms of overall image quality it looks as if it will be on a par with other good small-sensor 16mp cameras.
a) fuji overprices since they are aiming for a niche market, and likely not mass producing, as this is a brand new product for them.
i just can’t understand why fuji did not make the af speed and accuracy better on this new expensive camera.
that is the ideal place to shoot with a fuji, in that environment it should be vastly superior to any mft and better then any dslr camera from the big two.
if you can’t see that, then i appologize for challenging your disability.
(it really isn’t a fair comparison anyway…being that the leica is a ff sensor).
super af speed is not on top of everybodys requirements list.
my e-pl2 + 20mm f/1.7 failed so many time at clubs with friends.
no, the x pro-1 is kind of lumpen and lacks elegance.
so far i believe fuji is making his own consumer,.
the om-d is more mainstream, the first (?)mature m43 camera that is more multi-purpose.
they had priced the e-5 around 1700 eur , body only and the e-p3 at 1000 eur with (old ) kit lens.
i for one use a gf1 and a 7d for professional work and would love to get a 4/3 camera with better dxomark scores.
even if he comes up with something new, i am sure it will be just as uninspired and tedious.
if we want to categorize fuji with m4/3 , i believe is not even fair,since m 4/3 {om-d] has smaller sensor ,..but we should be proud if the new om-d can match the image quality of bigger sensor -aps c nikon ,canon,pentax,sony etc,..in the term of dr and high iso,.
i’m pretty convinced the om-d will sell more than the fuji xpro.
however, autofocus is very disappointing on the fuji and very good on the olympus, even if it’s exactly the same as on the current pen series.
it’s still a different camera than the yet-to-be-seen om-d series, more expensive and likely meant for more leisurely shooting, not stabilized, not weatherproof, but probably capable of very high image quality.
i am not the only one who thinks that the files lack sharpness.
other than that, this is like comparing apples and rumoured oranges.
the new fuji is not nearly as attractive as the x100and
when you put some effort to get some descent photography, you wanna make sure you get the best image quality available for such effort.
should admit that’s retro, but it’s a bit cumbersome, and… hmm… the two different textures of leather imitation denote anything but really good taste.
the x pro 1 w lens is only $100 more then the nex 7 with cz 24mm, i guess it will appeal to traditionalists congrat fuji:d first thing i don’t understand is how olympus were able to price the camera so low.
i do like the fact that there are no graphics on the face.
if you’re saying you have many professionally shot, try take same shot with bigger sensor cameray, i bet you would cry thinking that you could hv got some better image quality photos.
charlie…(posted above you…sorry), i really want xpro1 to be stellar too….maybe i am missing something.
picturing sheep shearing takes fast af… the best shearers strip the sheep of the wool in about one minute… no, it takes fast shutter and small aperture…hence the reason he shot at iso 6400 in fairly good light.
the om-d will no doubt compete against the nex7, and that is a very interesting situation.
great iq may be useless if you have poor focus system.
fuji is a camera maker who knows exactly the need of photographer,..see the example ,.with the lens they comes up,..all of them is fixed lens’ ,.again compare to panny who just make another toy with power zoom ,.no
good to see some aussie content.
the fuji x100 is now worth about 750 euros secondhand and in perfect condition.
please go cause daddy needs you to lick your sister’s blood off his engorged member so he can roll you over and give it to you like you like it.
unless its quality is much more superior than the gx1, it is too expensive for a retro design.
if comparing it with the other m4/3 cameras, i can understand.
you should aware from it’s launching time when it compare with most of ff dslr & not any of current market mirrorless .
they have no reason to change what’s working.
it is as kit lens as canon ef 70-200mm f/2.8l is ii usm is.
unless the fuji or the omd gets high dxo scores.
martin schoeller is still shooting with a texas leica (fuji gsw690iii) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1m7rsayb05m but fuji has replaced the pro gsw cameras with the gf670, which is aimed at fans of 1930s german folders.
one is using the aps-c sensor with let say nex5 or 7 + 24mm zeiss lens or others best quality lens available, and the other photographer using fully ‘tweak’ m4/3 sensor like in gx1 camera+ the best lens available shooting at the some objects at same situation.
a photographer with their own taste ,passion, and creativity,..just like the x100 owner.
you are merely a foolish peasant sitting in his own body wastes typing at your computer wishing to again walk among the elite!
at $1700 usd, i need a camera featuring a accurate, superbly fast auto focus system.
if i was shooting digital like them it would be no question that i would prefer the fuji over any mft or the nikon offerings.
the advantage in resolution (due to no aa filter) and high iso (due to aps-c sensor size) of the fuji should not be too important compared to the kind of advantages that the om-d might have.
the fuji does not have to compete against the olympus at its price point.
i just laugh when i hear people wanting to compare it to cmaeras that are not in its league.
i will keep my ff dslr kit and my mft….my mind might change somewhat if i could see some razor sharp images from the camera.
but, if holding up your flexibility flag helps you sleep better tonight, then knock yourself out.
the images coming from my mft cameras with prime lenses are sharper than those images… name email (not published)
buying a kit lens separately without a body has always cost a lot more than the price difference between the body only camera and the camera with kit lens.
i also want a camera offering me a wide range of lens.
i have some money to spend on new tech toys this year and i’ll probably go with the fuji and the 35mm lens.
the first offerings from panny and olympus were admittedly interesting, but after seeing a dozen incarnations of basically the same thing in a different dress, it got boring for me.
of course, bonuses would be: * improved video support * fast af of 43 lenses — i haven’t invested in such, but realize there are several top notch 43 lenses, * weather sealing is very positive * 16
fuji x pro 1 gets price and preorder option.
http://blog.livedoor.jp/e_p1/archives/cat_50050348.html yet another livedoor mockup that have no resemblance with the leaked pictures.
who knows… i might end up buying the om-d too… finally a good body to go with my voigtlaender 25mm… if the om-d has a spectacularly good evf, as hinted at, i prefer that to the fuji x-pro1′s hybrid vf.
i say…just keep my extensive mft kit with all these lenses…and hang in until a camera comes out with more dr and we are good.
the turf battle will be between the “e-m5″ and the nex-7, and olympus will price under that, as the nex-7 has a larger sensor.
sure non pros will purchase it too but its aimed at pros.
i have tested the gf1 in studio, and on assignment.
at $2,300.00 not in the same price category, not an auto-focus contender if first reports bear out, not a size contender as it’s closer to the d3100.
fuji is doing a niche product with some good ingredients: non-aa sensor for good sharpness + based on a good proven sensor, all metal construction, decent prime lens line and a well-thought simplistic design.
dxo scores are accurate a gf1 is not as good as a 7d but a nex7 is, and that is my next camera.
unless om capable to produce iq on par / close to x pro then i’ll definitely will get an om but this is very unlikely .
for some reason i’m having no issues whatsoever making this my second camera to go with the d3 (and will be getting a d4).
lack of modern control layout and ergonomy isn’t valid reason for that.
we the godlike photographic elite shall show no pity upon you, and if your are lucky may shit into your gaping mouths so that you may taste a little of what greatness is!
if you were really a professional once you wouldn’t let a micro four turd camera near you!
let’s be honest folks, that puny sensored device of the peasantry is no match for the godlike fuji.
olympus has the lens advantage.
plastic is fine if it lasts for >2 years before the next one comes along.
the e-p3′s kit 14-42mm lens is $299 if you buy it separately.
3) all modern cameras produce excellent results, so choose one that suits you, and don’t obsess over quasi scientific tests.
please explain to me why you frequent this site if your camera equipment is more than adequate.
if it is, i will buy one anyway as my second camera behind the x-pro1.
fast aperture as for the improovement,,the image quality is not better than the old 14-45.
currently has only 3 (native) lenses, and it’s not even weather sealed .
he also uses the x100 before and really like it.
also not weather sealed, no in-body is, few lenses,… i hope that panasonic will join the party too with a great camera coming soon!
the om-d comes in at the right time – there’s many people who have bought into the system that are looking for something just a bit better than what’s available now.
yes, “the buzz” certainly died down after that — panasonic eventually got its distribution sorted out, and those of us who wanted a gh2 were able to get them and since then we’ve quietly been making nice pictures and videos with them.
it might not be the camera that the average ‘meat and potatoes’ shooter uses in their business but for many professionals this will work.
you can’t necessarily subtract the cost of the lens from the bundle and get the body-only price.
i have to say…based on the lack of critical sharpness in the images coming from the fuji website and now the private sector i am very disappointed in the level of quality from the fuji.
i also think the built in flash will be a pop up design like on the e-p3 in the same position.
olympus does not have leading sensor design capability nor does it have sensor manufacture.
i think if you are so concentrating on sensor size and not on the glass in front of the sensor or good photographic technique then your expensive sensors will get you nothing worthwhile.
hence they can produce it at higher quantities and at a lower cost.
i would hope the new rumoured olympus point & shoot wil be a lot less money than the professional fuji.
such a nice tool seriously crippled by a failing af system.
$1700 is close to the $200 where you can buy ff dslr cameras.
yes, there is the 12mm, but that is one lens, it isn’t weather sealed, and it’s silver, which looks awful (imo) on a black body.
xpro will be my ‘big’ system and m43 will be my small system… no move to v1 system until lens lineup would top the m43 group..
it’s simplicity is what makes it close to a perfect camera.
the people who are busy shooting professionally don’t waste time pouring over dxomark scores and comparisons, but rather pick the tools that are “good enough” to do the job.
but, those first three lenses are pretty nice, as far as specs go.
for the olympus itself ,.there is no doubt in my mind om-d will be a real winner on its own class/m43 up to date , .and to me it seems like olympus has more passion ,soul,love as a photography company
i now just shoot for the enjoyment and use a 5dmkii and some mft equipment.
(some were take from e-5, x100, but most from panasonic l1, a 7.5 mp with low dr) i buy the cam for autofocus quality not image quality admin:
based on the rumors the om-d seems much more like an amateur photographer’s wishlist camera.
i already own an e-5 which is fast enough for me (probably still beats a pen in real life situations).
x pro aimed for pro-leica fans or highend standard user like me & i don’t consider om will compete against it .
the same people complaining about the noise visible in 100% crop of an iso 3200 shot has likely never printed one of those shots.
the high iso prints that fuji presented already demonstrate that the image quality at high iso values beats much larger sensors than its own.
you can always wait a few months and buy a secondhand olympus or fuji for about 2/3 of the price.
if the omd is priced at $1,100 usd (body) vs a $1700 fuji (body), i don’t think they are in the same class.
they were never refreshing or entertaining in the first place.
“godlike photographic elite” actually use olympus.
sample images from the fuji are starting to appear, and the consensus (which i share) is that the image quality isn’t as impressive as the rumors had fantasized.
agree completely… the fuji looks great, but it is a bit of a chunky brick.
i like fuji as a company i used their lenses on my view cameras for years.
lenses are available too at amazon (click here), adorama (click here) and bhphoto (click here).
with such a limited, and pricey, lens selection the fuji isn’t much competition for anything, imho.
the difference is so small just compare at 100%.
i also think the retro look is very cool.
they need to pay back the high r&d cost.
at $1700, i also would like to have 3d server focus, like what om-d, nikon, or cannon have.
i think the geek is kind of lumpen.
yep, but not with enough money to be able to afford the red ball logo!
weep filthy peasant so that we photographic elite may drink of your tears and mock you!
i’m not taking anything away from the om-d. i hope it’s a great camera with an honest new sensor and not some panasonic rehash.
in making photography tool rather than sony and panasonic as a giant electronic company,.with their own interest and features,.. come on !
the ones who feel the need to constantly upgrade are generally amateurs who obsess over dpreview and dxomark, while the pros are out shooting and making money.
i would buy only if i can make money with it.
the gf1 shines as a street shooting and family camera.
“fuji is a camera maker who knows exactly the need of photographer”
within the mft price range, the om-d is going to be the leader and it might actually hurt sony more than anybody else.
the om-d isn’t worthy of wiping the x100′s ass with it’s
“clearly the nex-7 has generated far more buzz than the gh2 ever did…” clearly you don’t remember the gh2-mania when it first appeared — people were calling panasonic and waiting on hold for hours trying to get their shipping status; forums were burning up with messages about “i just bought one at dealer x and they said they have two more” followed by barrages of phone calls; forums also were burning with angry complaints about mixed messages from panasonic (“yes, it’s shipping/no, it isn’t shipping yet”) etc., etc.
it (the om-d) may be it is a better built camera and with a little better iq compared to g3/gx1.
i’m no fuji fanboy either, but they sure were listening when they came up with their latest gear.
and with that head bump, i do not believe it will achieve anything good in the portability department.
i think that the sensor has incredible dynamic range and the colors are really vibrant…but the images i have seen are not critically sharp.
but to dismiss is as inferior due to something as silly as sensor size is ludicrous.
this camera is priced perfectly to keep the unclean little people away from it.
if the auto-focus is fast enough that is – and it doesn’t need to be close to the pen’s or om-d’s performance.
it would be nice if it looks good.
so what if 2 photographers, both have good photographic technique.
i may just be seeing images with too much nr…but the leica images downsized to compete…blow it away.
the hybrid vf is very important to some as is the iq.
it just depends on what kind of photographer you are or gonna be with the advent of nex cameras, xpro-1, perhaps pentax in the future, the size isn’t the obvious advantage anymore for the m4/3s.
i realise m43 system also ‘suffers’ from this, but at least their cdaf isn’t so bad, and i kind of accept it in a ‘small’ system.
that would have sold like hot cakes.
if that happens the mft cameras i have now can dance circles around the fuji from a performance standpoint!
@cansalt this is a bit sick: choosing the camera based on dxo sensor score.
– all the images … have been passed through photoshop, according to the exif, but are said to be unprocessed.
lack of “weather sealing” (only god knows what that means!) did not affect the operation of g1 or gh-2s.
yo geek…i sell prints made with my mft camera in galleries every month.
even at 13×19″ prints, what looks like a “too noisy” image on the computer can make for excellent output.
i do need a camera which assists me to focus manually efficiently and precisely, like what canon or nikon offer in their $1000 – $2000 bodies.
the size of aps-c sensor cameras are getting smaller than they used to.
we should compare fuji against another aps-c sensor camera both slr and mirrorless with close range of price for 1700$ -canon 7d, nikon d300s /d7000or
the real fight will be nex-7 vs omd.
if you want high (build) quality optics you use 4/3, if you want light you use m4/3.
it will be very disappointing to keep up hopes for a mft camera to even get close to that.
instead of starting with crappy kit lenses they are going straight for the high end… higher price aside, this is very much a contender.
the fuji will probably destroy the olympus image quality five times over.
@pingflood please don’t waste your/my time with your “good enough” drivel, it is insulting to people that are passionate about cameras and camera technology.
+10 i agree with you fuji made their camera as a photography tool rather than panny [g3,gx1,gf3]which just made a camera like a computer toys with a lens.
well unless you take photography only for facebook or other sites, then who cares, it prolly just a ‘small’ difference in quality compare to the bigger sensor cameras.
but it does seem to me that after everything shakes out in this newly-emerging “premium mirrorless” segment, the fuji will sell mostly to people who value its traditional-style design, construction and controls; the sony nex-7 will sell to advanced-tech fans; and the olympus will fall somewhere in between.
anyone in the target market segment would jump at the opportunity.
honestly, if all is true about the om-d i think that olympus really has a winner this time.
i think the m4/3rds stuff is great for what it is.
however, the balance of size and image quality is what i like, so i deal with the things i dislike.
but is main talent is landscaping photo and retouching it in photoshop i guess.
omg has to be better than (ie., better sensor) the gh-2 and as versatile (ie., swivel lcd.
it’ll appeal to all the rangefinder snobs with lots of money, but that’s about it.
even the newest gx1 has smeared color,and less detail than the outstanding gf1,.
the small micro 4/3 sensor can never give good enough image quality at settings above iso200.
when we buy almost $2000 camera system, we should evaluate the whole performance.
i really hope that the om-d is the same size, roughly, as the e-p3 (assuming of course a little bump extra on top), so m4/3 maintains its size advantage.
whichever way that goes, i think its pretty obvious that the om-d will not have better image quality or high iso then the x-pro1.
i did not make it clear enough but when i said that the dxo marks are accurate, i meant that in my experience the gf1 does not have a good enough sensor to replace my 7d. i wish it did.
sony a99 or a88 will still be a $2000ish ff.
no competition really since these are two very different camera’s.
[repeating what i've stated on "olympus 12-50mm in stock at bhphoto (updated gx1 status)"] with 12-50 msrping at $500, there is no way om-d bundled with this lens can be sold for $1150-1300 as rumor suggested as that would mean om-d’s body price is the same or lower than e-p3′s.
yes, they are photographers who were hand-picked by fuji to be among the first users of a highly-sought-after new camera.
your peasant/elite comments are old.
i hope they haven’t done any cost cutting in the wrong areas and that this does not affect the durability of the cameras, which i think was very good on e-system cameras.
but again, if you just shooting street, strangers and post it on the web, this might be one of your option the more the price of the omd comes close to the fuji, the fuji becomes a contender (and in my opinion, in a few ways may very well win, even without weather sealing).
m43 has fast af, nex has focus peaking, leica m has a rangefinder.
i could see this given that they are coming out with a weatherproof adapter.
you can also create an account.
especially now the slightly superior xpro-1 is here.
fuji is somewhat slow in getting product out to someplaces, though not as bad as panasonic is sometimes.
geek would never be invited to the party.
for me, the biggest drawback to the fuji was focus by wire.
the only thing i know for sure is it won’t be in the same category as that new pro fuji.
i can show you many, many, many professionally shot and published images made using m 4/3 gear.
olympus makes great cameras but have yet to make one that is worth comparing to the new fuji or the d4.
when the d800 is announced, $2000 for ff will be a distant memory.
daddy needs you to lick him clean again, your sister is busy with mommy.
they have full manual controls, interchangeable lenses, etc….very much the same flexibility the fuji will have.
if have to say ,.there no progress what so ever in the term of image quality for the past 2 years,.. ‘fuji is a camera maker who knows exactly the need of photographer’
my point was that the whole “outdated in 2 years” is something created by the people endlessly obsessing over 100% crops and noise data keep perpetuating, and is no doubt loved and encouraged by the manufacturers.
what i find so surprising is how quick others like you are to come to its defence.
the x-pro1 is going to wipe the floor with any mft camera.
you’re not being called a troll because you may not think the same, it’s because you make a blantantly idiotic comment.
naw, i think i’m being called a troll because i’m not a fanboy.
i would have expected the om-d to cost around 1300-1400 eur with the kit lens which would have been in line with other semi-pro full weather sealed bodies.
with the limited, and pricey, lens selection this isn’t much of a competitor to anything, if you ask me.
+1 $1700 is quite a niche non-professional camera in digital times, when equipment gets outdated in 2 years max.
http://www.dpreview.com/news/2012/02/01/fujifilm_first_x-pro1_images i feel the same way about these images that most of the people who commented there.
the real problem with the fuji is that its a lot of case for a system thats still undeveloped and unproven.
those guys really lack a sense for proportions.
pingflood, fuji is nowhere near the camera that pro’s will be using _for work_.
if the rumours about the specs are true, then i think its the camera that a lot of us have been waiting for.
hmmm… exactly, and ff dslr is a tool that designed for business, not leisure.
website cforms contact form by delicious:dayslog in box to start connecting please log in first.
i for one go on this site to see when we are going to get a better camera body (thus a better dxo mark score).
i have invested in the nikon system and the m43 system (“big” and “small”).
sure it will work, same as equipment that pro’ supposedly have already, so what’t the point to hurt a bottom line.
what i want is a small (enough) camera with excellent image quality at low light.
while i think the fuji is a lovely camera, i don’t think it is an om-d contender.
you have to admit, fuji believes in this system and they are doing it right immediately out of the box.
i don’t mind buying a $1700 body as long as its price tag makes sense.
4) just enjoy shooting images.
yes, but fuji claims that it’s apsc sensor offers the same iq as ff cameras, so in their logic it makes sense.
they can be much more competitive.
i only shoot girls in lowlight so hi-iso is very important for me.
the 14-42 is going for $120 on ebay and that’s the actual street price.
if, and only if, the sensor does deliver a very good performance as rumored (it doesn’t have to match the fuji one that’s bigger, but should be within 1 f-stop behind).
so far the new olympus is strictly a vaporcamera, so it’s a bit silly to compare the performance of something which we know only on the basis of hearsay (the fuji) to something we don’t know at all (the olympus.)
that may in fact turn out to be the best place to be: a blend of classic feel and modern tech is probably what most of the customers in this segment really want.
a bigger sensor does not a better image make!
a good competitor to the om-d, with better iq (if you shoot raw), but imo with less appeal to photographers than an olympus camera.
based on rumors and early x pro 1 test (seefujirumors ) i guess that this is the advantages-disadvantages list: olympus om-d advantages: - cheaper - weather sealed - better video quality - super fast autofocus - smaller body (if you care about size) - lens line up (and powerzoom lens availability) - built-in stabilization - tilting lcd fuji x pro 1 advantages: - superb image quality - hybrid viewfinder
olympus likely already have decent estimates of how much the omd will sell as m4/3 market is much more mature and better defined.
must be lack of size on you someplace.
i think the fuji images i’ve seen have stellar iq.
so far, i like what i see.
along the sony nex-7 ($1200) this will become the main competitor of the olympus om-d which rumored price is around $1100.
it is though a very special camera that not everyone need/can handle.
