i have also sold two lenses, and now i have my l glass to sell which does include a 300mm 2.8 non is l lens.
though the 1d3 was no slouch above 1600 and there is little quantitative difference between the two cameras in terms of noise levels, the advantages of the d3 are clear to even the most casual of viewers at no more than 25% magnification.
under similar conditions, the luminance noise pattern of the canon 1d3 looks mostly smooth with random “pits.”

i do agree on the canon flash being somewhat inconsistent.
you can follow any responses to this entry through the rss 2.0 feed.
while i know the 1dmkiv is on the horizon, i am of the opinion that nikon is the best way to go for me.
so far i have purchased the d700 and a 50mm 1.4g afs just to make sure i like the camera and solidify the commitment.
furthermore the feeling and position of the portrait and landscape af-on buttons are different which gives them a poorly implemented quality.
window on the world – thanks to its 35mm sensor, the viewfinder on the d3 is larger and brighter than that of the 1d3.
note, that i did learn one thing from this,…and that is the ability to change ss and ap while maintaining your index finger on the sr button.
under auto white balance skin tones tend to have a warm look.
in the very worst case, the eyepiece will rub against your side, fall off and leave your carefully adjusted diopter to twist.
the new nikon lenses with the nano coated are expensive compared to what i originally paid for my canon glass.

the d3 also lacks the “silent” shooting mode found on the canon 1-series .
gamepad versus joystick – the multi-function controller of the d3 is sort of canon’s joystick and set button all-in-one.
best, chrislog in to reply hi todd, thanks.
log in to reply love the article chris, although i am a nikon shooter for the past who know’s, i had the opportunity to shoot the d3 for a youth ice hockey tournament and was blown away because using only my 2.8 300mil, switching from fx format to dx was a god blessing.
for instance, i think canon has a nicer menu layout and a better af selection system when using only 9 points.
nikon cameras are slightly bias towards orange in terms of skin tones.
the 1d3 has a large squarish grip that inspires confidence despite feeling heavier on the left side of the camera than the right.
you can purchase whoop ass at any duane reade pharmacy.
that the camera will confirm focus in both single and continous focus modes.
though it doesn’t win any awards for beauty,the d3 controls are very easy to manipulate and can even be used with gloves on.
where the d3 really bests the canon is in handling, size and placement of the control surfaces, shutter and rear af-on button.

glad you’re likin it!log in to reply [...] as the af performance in servo mode was one of the main reasons i sold my canon eos-1d mark iii and switched to nikon, i’m very happy to see that good things can get even [...]
in addition, the shutter release and mirror blackout are faster on the d3 which more than makes up for any techical difference.
log in to reply rumle skafte says: january 8, 2009 at 3:30 pm very nice review, i went the same way you did a year ago, though from two markiins.
even if the focus isn’t the best, the 5dmk2 would be a huge improvement over your 350d any day.
however i soon found that i didn’t have to change the same settings because the nikon was doing more for me without the small tweaks.
although the two cameras are only tens of milliseconds apart in each of these specs, the difference is large enough thatalmost every canon photographer i’ve let try my d3is surprised at how quickly the camera acquires focus and shoots.
part of this could have been user error as well.
what i also realize is that the shot to shot time is on of the most important things to me so there is a grip in my future.
i think that nikon has a great thing going with their lineup right now.
the mirror slap of the d3 is like a machine gun and machine guns make baby jesus cry.
my best guess was that the camera’s autofocus system is easily confused and prone to hyperactivity.
image quality if all else is equal, the d3 is well matched to the 1d3 below iso 1600.
furthermore the feeling and position of the portrait and landscape af-on buttons are different which gives them a poorly implemented quality.
i have had the camera 2 days and so far i am very comfortable with my decision.
in ai-servo mode, i worked around this problem by reducing the maximum frame rate to 8 and turning the cameras focus tracking to the slowest setting.
i have never had a camera that can focus so quickly and stay focused no matter the situation.
they old statement that goes something like “nikon cameras are built for photographers by photographers and canon cameras are built for photographers by engineers” still holds true in a lot of the little details.
canon ergo made a huge leap forward with the 40d and 1d3.
log in to reply chris,…this was a nice read on two strong workhorses of the digital capture industry.
i will now practice this techique and make it second nature.
though they don’t look so different side by side, actually holding the cameras is a very different experience.
but i also think thatthe wider canon ef mount and the little red bumps on canon lenses are a big bonus.
one of the things that drove me crazy about using the 1d3 on servo focus was that it was very hyper reactive.
i’d be happy to answer your specific questions over email.
cans come in medium, large, and i-pity-the-fool.
in addition, the d3 meter remains active in the view finder when adjusting the camera’s iso setting (something that drove me crazy when using the canon).
if all else is equal, the d3 is well matched to the 1d3 below iso 1600.
i know from my experience i rarely shoot at 8fps unless i am looking to capture a quick sequence, so the 3 to 5fps is more than adequate.
the shutter release and the mirror blackout of the d3 are clear improvement over the 1d3.
wider throat – i’m finding that canon lenses are easier to mount on the 1d3 than nikon lenses on the d3.
when i was deciding to ungrade recently i went with the d300 and i am really happy with nikon’s line of bodies and lenses out right now.
in fact, there are so few unacceptably focused images from the d3 that the new camera has actually made it harder to finish editing.
to my surprise, the front and rearcontrol dials on the d3 can be used to adjust aperture and shutter speed without taking your index finger off of the shutter release .
compared to the 1d3, hitting the diagonal focus points on the nikon is very, very easy.
i also find that greens and blues are slightly more saturated.
the d3 will confirm focus in the viewfinder in single and servo focus modes.
the nikon af-on buttons have a short throw that ends with afirm stop when the button is fully depressed.
compared to the 1d3, hitting the diagonal focus points on the nikon is very, very easy.
i shoot a lot of sports but i am diversified in what i shoot.
log in to reply jmd says: january 8, 2009 at 2:28 pm chris,…this was a nice read on two strong workhorses of the digital capture industry.
by contast the 1d3 was considerably warmer, especially in the reds.
i would even go so far as to say that i was shocked by how bad nikon’s menus still looked the first time i turned on the d3.
if you can send me an email via the contact form with this info and a sample image, i may be able to help.
even with these workarounds i shot many more frames than i needed becausethe camera continually demonstrated that it could not be trusted.
whereas canon’s joystick is arguably their most immature control surface, the multi-controller is arguably nikon’s best.

not to say canon stuff completely blows, i just like the physical interface of the nikon gear.
so far i have found the d700 features highly adjustable and i do look forward to what i feel is more accurate metering and flash system that nikon provides.
i held off selling all my l glass just until i reach a comfort zone
not to say canon stuff completely blows, i just like the physical interface of the nikon gear.
a burst of 5 frames focused on a stationery subject using the 1d3 in servo focus would often return 5 different focus solutions with only 1 critically sharp.
while a soft and contoured grip might seem like a good thing,i am almost positive that the rubber used on the d3 is less durable than its canon counterpart.
but it can come in handy when you don’t have a millisecond to spare.
to support this, i’ve met a few press and sports photojournalists who tried the 1d3 and went back to the 1d2mkiin.
i did not for instance love the color rendition of the d2x.
i find that the nikon af system gives much better feedback than canon.
my canon my menu had about 8 settings that i changed fairly regularly.
while the d3 has a measurable advantage over the canon in terms of noise, saturation, and dynamic range at high isos, the difference is fairly small.
the 1d3 has a large squarish grip that inspires confidence despite feeling heavier on the left side of the camera than the right.
rumle todd says: january 9, 2009 at 6:40 am regarding lenses, i would anticipate that, following the new 50mm f/1.4, an af-s 85mmm f/1.4 should be coming down the pipe in the next year.
i am surprised that in some of the worst conditions, the luminance noise pattern of the d3 still looks a lot like film grain.
my nikon my menu has only 3 (toggle af-on, format card and battery info).
the combo worked well for the most part but would sometimes overexpose the subject at random.
the best thing about the sb900 is that it’s dead simple to set up the master/slave settings.
– the buttons of the d3 are larger by comparison and give the back of the body a busy look.
8) that the lcd can be used to confirm critical focus at 100% magnification.
rumlelog in to reply regarding lenses, i would anticipate that, following the new 50mm f/1.4, an af-s 85mmm f/1.4 should be coming down the pipe in the next year.
of course when you buy an upper end body, you know that the value drops significantly with every new model released.

in case anyone is confused – having the meter active in the viewfinder when making iso adjustments allows the photographer to adjust the sensitivitywithout metering, guessing at the proper iso and metering again.
when i switched from canon to nikon i effectively lost one lens in the shakedown.
i am very pleased to say that i have no such problems with the nikon d3.
don’t apologize for asking questions, i’m happy to answer them.
this was particularly hard when tracking a moving subject like a groom in a black/white tux.
it was that it couldn’t do it reliably.
one of the things that drove me crazy about the metering on the 1d3 was that you could not get the shutter to lock the metering in spot or center weighted modes.
though they don’t look so different side by side, actually holding the cameras is a very different experience.
i shoot sports and this is the only camera that gets the job done.
if you’re using an sb900, the flash system on the d3 is great.
the action of the af-on buttons on the 1d3 feelsoverly soft and lacks a clear stopping point.
i will probably end up with a 105mm as well because by the time you add the 1.3 multiplier for the 1d sensor you get pretty close.
in the very worst case, the eyepiece will rub against your side, fall off and leave your carefully adjusted diopter to twist.
log in to reply hi keith, thanks for the note.
how do i compensate in camera for the overly saturated skin tones which tend to be too red and orange at times inspite of a custom white balance.
the d700 is a better camera in almost every single regard except for resolution and video capability.
you kinda hit every thing that i observed back then.
though i irrationally fear the d3 might tip over, the slightly smaller footprint gives the camera a pleasant weight distribution that does not shift when moving between landscape and portrait orientations.
i am very pleased to say that i have no such problems with the nikon d3.
in single-focus mode i often pumped the af-on button to make sure the focus was locked before shooting.
chris is available for editorial and corporate assignments in the new york area and abroad.
since switching brands is so costly and there are definitely upsides to using canon, i would rent or borrow a d3 with one of the new zoom and use it for a couple of days before making any snap decisions.
all 51 points of the nikon array are user selectable but only 15 are f/2.8 spec.
i also think that the round, screw-type eyepiece and lockable diopter knob are nice features on the d3.
i’d say that the 1d3 is capable of extracting slightly more fine detail thanks to its higher pixel density but nikon files have a certain three dimensional quality that only comes with a full frame sensor.
it was that it couldn’t do it reliably.
where the d3 really bests the canon is in handling, size and placement of the control surfaces, shutter and rear af-on button.
– the buttons of the d3 are larger by comparison and give the back of the body a busy look.
4) that half pressing the shutter will lock exposure when using spot metering.
looking over the full sets from three separate shoots with three separate lighting rigs, i am shocked by two things: 1) how few totally out of focus images there are 2) how many critically in focus images there are.
for the record, the problem with the canon 1d3 was not that it couldn’t take a perfectly focused photo (of which i have many).
in case anyone is confused – having the meter active in the viewfinder when making iso adjustments allows the photographer to adjust the sensitivitywithout metering, guessing at the proper iso and metering again.
when i had my first day with the markiis i lost an eyecup because i thought that when it was so new it would be tight… no way.
i know both companies recently raised prices on glass.
while a soft and contoured grip might seem like a good thing,i am almost positive that the rubber used on the d3 is less durable than its canon counterpart.
that being said, i haven’t found any benefit to actually using all 51 points for concert photography even though i have all of them turned on.
also the fact that i can increase the fps by adding the grip made a lot of sense to me when i need that feature.
for instance, they didn’t leave the “cool stuff” out of the d300 just because it’s not the “flagship” model.
my copy of the 1d3 would regularly and unpredictably confirm focus incorrectly resulting in a poorly focused image.
the fact that nikon has finally gone full frame, put the work into improving their lens technology, and improving their focusing system.
under similar conditions, the luminance noise pattern of the canon 1d3 looks mostly smooth with random “pits.”
2) that the focus pattern can be changed to single with one finger without lowering the camera.
i’ve spoken to one other person who has converted from a 5d mark ii to a d700 and am getting more convinced to get the d700 because it’s better for shooting portraits esp.
above iso 1600 d3 images processed with nikon capture nx 2 seem sharper, lower noise and move vibrant than those of the 1d3 processed with either canon digital picture professional or adobe lightroom.
the flash performance between the 1d3 and d3 will vary wildly depending on what flash you have on top.
whereas canon’s joystick is arguably their most immature control surface, the multi-controller is arguably nikon’s best.
i will now practice this techique and make it second nature.
with its heavily contoured profile the nikon d3 feels smaller and more dense.
for the record, the problem with the canon 1d3 was not that it couldn’t take a perfectly focused photo (of which i have many).
i think nikon and canon have very different design philosophies that play out in their flagships, and it’s interesting to get your perspective on them.
the metering was also confused by reflective surfaces in the background.
some additional things i love about the d3 vs. the 1d3 are: 1) that the focus mode can be changed from single to continuous with one finger without lowering the camera.
in my opinion, it doesn’t matter if you have an 85 f/1.2 lens and a 25mp photo if it’s out of focus because the camera screwed up.
the 580ex ii is a very good flash with plenty of power.
the nikon af system is also much more reliable when shooting stationary subjects using servo focus.
i’m currently a canon shooter, but am seriously considering to switch over to nikon because i kind of prefer its out-of-camera color rendition (could you share a bit more about the d2x color as well?) and the better flash system.
log in to reply hey eric, i have my fx/dx toggle on back button/front wheel and it’s awesome.
wrap it in rubber – the rubber used on the nikon is soft and thick feeling compared to the hard grips on the 1d3.
nikon autofocus speed might be very slightly slower on the very first acquisition, but it’s dead reliable and dead-on accurate which is more than i could say about my 1d3 even in the best conditions.
the shutter release and the mirror blackout of the d3 are clear improvement over the 1d3.
3) that you can bracket with the shutter speed when shooting in manual mode.
with its heavily contoured profile the nikon d3 feels smaller and more dense.
no tinkering, no adjustments, just pick it up and shoot.
i really admire sports photographers – you guys know what the players are going to do before they do it – amazing.
i realise you have a different nikon camera, but if you don’t mind convincing me a bit more to chose nikon over canon, i’d really appreciate it.
however the problems i experienced with the af had very little to do with the “bright and sunny” conditions that the “fix” was supposed to address.
compared to the canon 1d3, the body of the nikon d3 feels smaller and oddly heavy with the 24-70mm attached.
my (completely) subjective feeling is that the increase in image quality at iso 1600+ is greater than the sum of its parts.
i even had an e-1 body i let go in addition to my 2 canon flashes and st-e2 lens.
would like to find out more about the colour of the images that are straight out of the camera, for example when both cameras are on standard preset or neutral preset.
even with these workarounds i shot many more frames than i needed becausethe camera continually demonstrated that it could not be trusted.
there are times when i’ve shot a quickly moving performer and i’m sure that i missed the shot.
while i shot nikon and other brands of film cameras prior digital, when digital came along i moved the canon 1d.
i haven’t handled nikon extensively but the canon af seems quite a bit snappier to me, especially under bright conditions.
in addition i have sold off an e0s-3 that i picked up just because i like to keep a film body and the e0s-3 eye focus always drew my interest.
i am surprised that in some of the worst conditions, the luminance noise pattern of the d3 still looks a lot like film grain.
the snap is strong enough that you can feel it in the finges of your left hand when holding the lens.
the best thing about all of these camera bodies is how similar they are in terms of performance and features.
i’d say that the 1d3 is capable of extracting slightly more fine detail thanks to its higher pixel density but nikon files have a certain three dimensional quality that only comes with a full frame sensor.
the action of the af-on buttons on the 1d3 feelsoverly soft and lacks a clear stopping point.
would like to find out more about the colour of the images that are straight out of the camera, for example when both cameras are on standard preset or neutral preset.
i would also eventually love to buy the 200-400mm.
i would often shoot on the neutral picture style as i thought standard was too contrasty and too red for me.

if you’re taking a lot of portraits in low light, then the d700 and the right lenses will definitely focus more accurately than the 5dmk2.
that there no difference in af accuracy between single and continuous mode when shooting a static subject.
the nikon lenses tend to “snap” rather than “ease” into place when the af locks on.

i think nikon and canon have very different design philosophies that play out in their flagships, and it’s interesting to get your perspective on them.
i tend to shoot on stardard.
i was in a panic to get the shot and put my fingers in the “wrong” position.
nikon’s color came closer to canon with the d300/d700/d3/d3x and canon’s color came a bit closer to nikon.
in addition, the d3 meter remains active in the view finder when adjusting the camera’s iso setting (something that drove me crazy when using the canon).
angellog in to reply hi angel, a lot of the color reproduction depends on which color space you’re shooting in (adobe rgb or srgb), the color profile you’ve set up on your camera (portrait, standard, neutral) and the program you’re using to process the raw files.
replacement eyecups must be canons largest export.
my disappointment with the 5dmk2 was the reason i switched to nikon from canon.
jmd ps: pls don’t release my email adrs to spammers!log in to reply very nice review, i went the same way you did a year ago, though from two markiins.
i shoot portraiture and color is critical to the service i provide.
my copy of the 1d3 would regularly and unpredictably confirm focus incorrectly resulting in a poorly focused image.
i am also impressed by the tenacity of the d3 servo-focus system.
of course i do not think there is any disputing that image quality of the original 1d was first class for its time period.
the d3 was set so a hold on the bottom front button and the back wheel it went from normal 24 x 36 to crop dx without putting the camera down.
but then again my camera is such a baby compare to d3 not to mention that i got no skill haha.
my feeling was that the ground-up redesigned af that canon put into the 1d3 and 1ds3 was just a lemon, fix or no fix.
when i look at the photos later, low-and-behold, the d3 nailed it.
though switching to nikon was not without its casualties (read no 85mmf/1.4 af-s prime yet), i am very happy with my decision.
i think we’ll definitely see the 85mm soon and i would hope something like a 23mm as well.
if you own a lot of canon lenses and accessories, you might not want to switch.
in single-focus mode i often pumped the af-on button to make sure the focus was locked before shooting.
if you’re shooting slower than f/2.8 a lot of people will say you only need 1 accurate point.
one of the first things i did with the d3 was set up the customizable my menu to exactly mirror the list of settings i had in the canon my menu.
it’s got approximately double the power of the sb600 and in some circumstances, the flash is actually overpowered.
sorry about the long winded post, but this was a huge decision for me to make and yes it is costing me money to make the switch but i feel confident it will be worth in the end in the enjoyment and image quality that i will be able to achieve in the end.

+1.917.572.4499 nikon d3 initial thoughts i’ve now used my new nikon d3 for three separate shoots of three separate bands with three separate lighting rigs and my initial impressions are very favorable.
mainly, i was angry that they put such a crappy autofocus system into it.

the 200-400 would be my next lens purchase if i had $6k to throw around =)log in to reply hi aisha, the nikon d700 and canon 5dmk2 are very different cameras.
if i had to characterize the color bias of each camera it would be as follows: canon cameras are bias towards redish tones.
the d3 is the most versatile 35mm camera on the market right now and for the photographer that shoots a little bit of everything, it’s damn close to perfect.
although the two cameras are only tens of milliseconds apart in each of these specs, the difference is large enough thatalmost every canon photographer i’ve let try my d3is surprised at how quickly the camera acquires focus and shoots.
though i irrationally fear the d3 might tip over, the slightly smaller footprint gives the camera a pleasant weight distribution that does not shift when moving between landscape and portrait orientations.
at the time i felt it offered me the most for my money and had the features i preferred.
i also think that the round, screw-type eyepiece and lockable diopter knob are nice features on the d3.
from the d300/d700/d3/d3x, they’ve got a ton of things covered.
that changing the af point, shutter speed and aperture are all one step operations.
i decided on the d700 because it seems to offer the best of the d3 and still would offer me the focus speed that i enjoyed with my 1d and 1dmkii.
gamepad versus joystick – the multi-function controller of the d3 is sort of canon’s joystick and set button all-in-one.
a number of professional photographers i know much prefered the original 580ex to the mark ii because they felt that the original was more durable.
so even though you could link the spot meter to whatever af point you were using at the time, you had to keep that af point exactly on skin to get a properly exposed shot.
they also liked that it was far less complicated to use in master/slave modes.
unlike other nikon flashes the 900 can be rotated 180 degress in both directions.
the first time i did this, it was an accident.
log in to reply hi wayne, i think out of camera color rendition is totally a matter of personal preference.
i personally found d2x color a little too cool and magenta for me.
technical specs aside the best thing about the nikon af system is it’s character.
in practice i really only need 9 points that are accurate when focusing at f/2.8.
wider throat – i’m finding that canon lenses are easier to mount on the 1d3 than nikon lenses on the d3.
the exposure is extremely accurate and the character of the light is amazing.
compared to the canon 1d3, the body of the nikon d3 feels smaller and oddly heavy with the 24-70mm attached.
if you’ve ever wondered why so many canon press photographers have their eyepieces taped down to the body, it’s because they tend tocome loose, crack and fall off.
that d3 was a rental cause i had drop my 2.8 300mm- d2hs gear on ciment floor stadium seatings….yeah, my back up rig was my 2.8 400mm on a d200!
above iso 1600 d3 images processed with nikon capture nx 2 seem sharper, lower noise and move vibrant than those of the 1d3 processed with either canon digital picture professional or adobe lightroom.
i can say at least nikon offers a 5 year warranty on their glass compared to the 1 year from canon.
i find it a bit unpredictable but then again my camera is such a baby compare to d3 not to mention that i got no skill haha.
while the d3 has a measurable advantage over the canon in terms of noise, saturation, and dynamic range at high isos, the difference is fairly small.
it’s too bad that nikon tends to sit on this things.
a few days after using the d3 i was surprised by how well the camera works right out of the box.
