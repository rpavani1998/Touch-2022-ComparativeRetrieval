the d300s has been the unofficial "benchmark" nikon bird camera for a while now, so the d400 should be of interest to many bird photographers.canon's new super telephotos are expected to offer superb performance, but again at super prices.if canon and other companies did a smart market analysis on their customers and potential customers, they might adjust their marketing approach to accommodate this new market driven by recent retirees who are engaged in a hobby where light super telephoto lenses are very nice to have.under normal circumstances both cameras will do fine for the average person.it is very new and hasn't yet been tested for performance but word is that it will have similar performance to the d5100/d7000 class which is according to dxo having much better image quality, dynamic range, bit color depth among other things than the eos 60d.that is, they are offering features to justify high prices, not to satisfy existing or potential customers.i find this to be a nice hobby that gets me outdoors, gives me exercise and engages the brain in devising "hunting" strategies.right now, nikon is stronger than all others, but i suspect that in the long run, sony will win out.there is a rising population of recent retirees and i've heard long-time birders comment (complain) about the number of new birders out and around with cameras.another thing you have to keep in mind is that bodies come and go, and in the end you'll spend a bigger portion of your budget on a lens/lenses than on bodies.he was a lifelong nikon user and had a complete set of nikon super telephoto lenses.generally if demand rises, you manufacture more and manufacturing costs per unit decline (fixed costs are recovered over a greater number of units plus gains from economies of scale).so legacy equipment is a strong limiting factor when making such decisions.you can analyze thousands of pages of reviews and the internet is full of "advice" on which one will be the "ultimate".for example, their flagship dslr, the eos-1ds was recently discontinued, being replaced by the eos-1d x. canon was charging around $7000 for the discontinued model, but its features now longer justified such a price.
