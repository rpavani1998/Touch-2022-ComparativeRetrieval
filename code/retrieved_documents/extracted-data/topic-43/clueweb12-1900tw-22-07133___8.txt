the nikon coolpix s30 is the cheapest waterproof  camera available with optical zoom, with the closest competitor being the olympus tough tg-320, available for around £20 more.
shot-to-shot time was reasonable as long as you aren't using flash.
the camera performed quite well under tungsten lighting, and better under fluorescent lighting.
optical zoom isn't available while recording, but can be set before  recording.

focus at the wide-angle end was reasonable at around 0.4 seconds amd shutter response when focused was very quick.
