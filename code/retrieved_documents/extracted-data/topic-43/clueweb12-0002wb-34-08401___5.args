for that technology to have trickled down to the d5000 already is beneficial for beginning and intermediate photographers.
the d5000 works very well in fully automatic mode, including the autofocus feature of the lens.

pros - image quality is excellent - d5000 provides great mix of manual control and ease of use for a dslr - lcd can twist and swivel away from the camera - battery life is good for dslr camera - good collection of printed materials - quick start guide and user guide cons - learning the function of each button could be time consuming - autofocus can be slow, especially in low light - experienced photographers will want more features - lcd could use more resolution description - resolution: 12.3 megapixels - optical zoom: n/a, uses interchangeable lenses - lcd: 2.7-inch, 230,000 pixels (can tilt and rotate away from camera body) - maximum image size: 4288 x 2848 pixels - battery: li-ion (rechargable) - dimensions: 4.1 x 5.0 x 3.1 inches - weight: 20 ounces (body only, no battery, no memory card) - image sensor: cmos, 15.8 mm x 23.6
with the d5000,raw images are of a better quality than jpeg images.
the in-camera editing features are easy to apply.
after i had a chance to review thenikon d5000, i can understand the reason for the buzz.
the d5000 works very well in fully automatic mode, including the autofocus feature of the lens.
this lens worked great for wide angle shots; you'd want a different lens for telephoto shots, though.
finally, the d5000 includes an lcd that can be tilted and rotated away from the camera body, which is nice.
you also can rotate the lcd next to the camera body, protecting the lcd when not using the camera.
at times, the autofocus doesn't work very fast, especially with low-light photography, but it is accurate.
good collection of printed materials - quick start guide and user guide cons learning the function of each button could be time consuming autofocus can be slow, especially in low light experienced photographers will want more features lcd could use more resolution description optical zoom: n/a, uses interchangeable lenses lcd: 2.7-inch, 230,000 pixels (can tilt and rotate away from camera body)
the camera's weight is balanced nicely, and all of the buttons and lens rings were easily within reach.

performance start-up times are fast for the d5000, which doesn't always occur with a dslr.
good to shoot at any conditions.

my d5000 review unit included an 18mm-55mm equivalent interchangeable lens, which had sharp focus and image quality.

the best thing about the d5000 is it works well in fully manual mode, fully auto mode, or anything in between.
user reviews 5 out of 5 great camera, member rafatkhan photographs are the memories and views on paper and d-5000 from nikon brings out the images on paper.
unfortunately, the lcd's resolution is less than some dslr models.
however, if you want to learn more about photography, configuring the d5000'smanual control features is easy, and the camera shows the settings used during image playback.
however, for those looking for their first dslr camera, it's worth testing the d5000 (or any dslr model) before buying it, as dslr cameras are vastly different in operational technique, size, and weight than ultra compact point and shoot models.

you can use the lcd (called "live view") or the optical viewfinder to frame photos, but autofocus is slower when using live view, which is common among dslr models.
