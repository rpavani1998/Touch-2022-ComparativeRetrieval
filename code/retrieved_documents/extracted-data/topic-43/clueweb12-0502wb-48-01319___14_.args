nikon has proven again and again that it is capable to deliver robust and stable systems.nikon's highest resolution dslr to date, the d800 offers a 50% higher pixel count than the flagship d3x. as well as being potentially very attractive to studio and landscape professionals, the d800 should pique the interest of a great many enthusiast nikon users too - many of whom might have been 'stuck' at 12mp for years, with a d300, d300s or d700.it is also worth noting that the d800's sensor has a similar pixel pitch to the well-regarded 16mp d7000, which has very encouraging implications for image quality in both fx and dx capture modes.nikon's d800 is breaking new grounds with an affordable, state of the art stills camera with video capabilities.nikon's highest resolution dslr to date, the d800 offers a 50% higher pixel count than the flagship d3x. as well as being potentially very attractive to studio and landscape professionals, the d800 should pique the interest of a great many enthusiast nikon users too - many of whom might have been 'stuck' at 12mp for years, with a d300, d300s or d700.the d800's 36.3mp cmos sensor has by far the greatest pixel count of any non medium-format dslr currently on the market.the parallel advances made in sensor technology and internet video distribution have helped create the ability to capture and broadcast video footage.it also has a light sensor to detect ambient light levels, and adjust not only the screen brightness, but also the saturation, contrast and gamma as well, in an attempt to give optimized output.in turn this has put pressure on many professional photographers to capture clips alongside their stills.whilst we crave for perfection and sharpness in our images we should purchase the d800e but nikon have not convinced us that this is a credible option.bigger pixel is equal to better light reading performance, but image quality is a relative factor that depend upon the mix of a variety of factors that are determined by the photographer and his or her context.f5.6 or brighter f5.6-f8 f8 auto iso improvements nikon has for a long time offered a degree of control over its auto iso settings, allowing the user to specify a minimum shutter speed that the camera should aim to maintain by raising the iso.the monitor also has a gel resin layer between the lcd and the cover glass to minimise any risk of fogging when the camera is exposed to rapid changes of temperature.the monitor also has a gel resin layer between the lcd and the cover glass to minimiseÂ any risk of fogging when the camera is exposed to rapid changes of temperature.this simply means that the user can adjust the aperture while recording video in the a and m exposure modes.in principle this level of control should allow more exact matching of recording brightness across multiple camera / lens combinations.
