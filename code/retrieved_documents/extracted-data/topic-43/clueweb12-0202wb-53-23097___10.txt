all your comparisons definitely show the 3 cameras are better at different things and that one camera is not completely perfect.
the camera gives great expansion potential thanks to the flash hot-shoe, and rear accessory port.

handling hopefully the specifications and features of each camera has given you an idea of what each of these cameras offers, but it all becomes quite mute if the cameras are unable to offer the speed and image quality to back it up.
but all 3 cameras are winners and i wouldn't mind owning any of them.
i have the older canon s90 (and the older lumix lx3) and found the content valuable in making my decision to skip this particular generation of newer models and wait for the next.

i own sony a700 & a55 dslrs and previously owned the canon s90, so a lot to live up to in the image quality stakes.
i have bought pre-cut leathers from this company to cover my old film cameras and they are excellent to deal with.

outside shots nikon  coolpix p300 canon powershot s95 panasonic lumix lx5 iso160 iso100  iso100 here the nikon has produced the warmest most vibrant  colours, followed by the panasonic lumix lx5, which has produced the most life  like colours, while the canon has produced slightly cooler colours.
detail is very good on the p300 shot, although it is possible to see sharpening artefacts.
an added bonus is the 1080p video is great quality too.
if canon could improve on these downsides with the next model  (s100?), and perhaps add a flash hot-shoe, then canon would be onto a winner.

video performance: the lx5 has the  most control over video, but also offers only monochrome sound, while the s95  and p300 both feature stereo sound.

- original poster comments - your posts add a comment ephotozine, the web's friendliest photography community.
iso100 here you can see the difference between having a 24mm equivalent lens and a 28mm equivalent lens, with the s95 in the middle showing less of the scene than the others.
iso100 the p300 and s95 zoomed in has very similar telephoto reach, with the s95 zooming the furthest to an equivalent of 105mm.
the three cameras provide a wide range of features, and go to show that the  digital camera market is alive and well, with interesting, innovative, and  competitive products, with each model differencing itself enough to make each  camera worthy of your attention depending on your needs.
the s95 shows the softest results in these tests, as though the noise reduction settings are set too high.

lens performance (telephoto zoom)
features (colour coded) -
we decided to compare three of the most compact serious cameras to find out how they perform, and what they offer that makes them worth parting with your cold hard cash for.
the introduction of the new nikon coolpix p300 is the latest compact camera designed to offer manual controls and improved image quality, yet does it have the image quality to knock the canon and panasonic aside?
regarding the grip problem on the canon s90 and s95, camera leathers in the usa have cut panels in a very thin self-adhesive material to cover the s90 and are working on the same for the s95.
these panels are black and textured to give a better grip.
switching to the portrait scene mode produces softer skin, and removes red-eye  from the subject (an example is shown in the full review).

chedd canon_tog michae...
i don't know why you would need an extra flash for this camera and i really hope canon doesn't put one on the s100.
the build quality is exceptional.
further to this is features a well laid out menu system  with an abundance of options, including numerous video options, and comes with  a leather neck strap.
unfortunately the  camera lacks raw support, which could put some people off this camera, as you  will have to trust the jpeg results straight from the camera.
the nikon coolpix p300 features a normal sized 12 megapixel back lit cmos sensor that you would find in many other compact cameras (such as thenikon coolpix s9100), an f/1.8 - 4.9 wide angle lens starting at 24mm equivalent, and a high resolution 3 inch screen with 920k pixels.
also camera menu allows custom color settings for increasing sharpness and saturation giving a little better image quality.
the p300 and lx5  both feature dedicated video record buttons and let you use the optical zoom  while recording, while the s95 only has digital zoom while recording.
to test this we took 6 or more shots and calculated the average, so that consistent results were produced, we also made sure to test all the cameras at the same time to ensure the cameras were being tested under the same conditions.
the s95 is not necessarily slow, however, in this  competition it is noticeable that it scores as the slowest camera of the three,  apart from shutter response which seemed the quickest (just).
the  p300 offered the softest results, with the stronger contrast causing detail to  be lost in the shadow areas of images.
category: digital cameras rating:
we tested each camera's performance at focusing, shutter  response, shot to shot time, continuous shooting etc, and have posted the  results below.
the nikon coolpix p300 is  the cheapest, from £249, while thecanon powershot s95, is around  £299, and thepanasonic lumix lx5 is the most expensive of the  three, at around £349.
the canon offers a clever dial around the lens, raw support and customisable buttons.
i suppose as with many compacts there may be some artifacts magnified very closely but this would be like trying to make 6ft x 4ft posters from it, in other words in the real world the images look superb.
the team - ephotozine.
nikon coolpix p300 winner at... high speed shooting and  video... very good image quality with bright saturated images, also  the second smallest camera, but importantly offers hand grip at the front  and back (unlike the s95), and offers the lowest price.

unfortunately the camera lacks raw support, which could put some people off this camera, as you will have to trust the jpeg results straight from the camera.
detail is very good on the  p300 shot, although it is possible to see sharpening artefacts.
the lx5 is to be commended for excellent focusing  speed, and general all round quick performance, whilst not as quick as the  p300, the 2.5fps continuous shooting is still adequate, and the rest of the  performance figures are good.

i have brought this camera and the results are superb.

the nikon coolpix p300 with smaller sensor produces good results, better than some expected thanks to the backlit cmos sensor, and extremely rapid performance in the form of 8fps shooting, high speed video and full hd video recording, and is thereforehighly recommended (and a close second).
this greatly improves it's low-light capabilities.

it also allows a few more tweaks like choosing super fine jpeg images.
this is followed by the p300 with a close focusing distance of 3cm and excellent detail, with the s95 faring the worst in this test, only allowing you to focus on subjects 5cm away from the lens.
the lx5 has the most detail with excellent detail in both bright and shadow areas, with the s95 giving slightly softer results, and less detail in the shadow areas.

i have not worked without an external flash for 40 years, and i already have an olympus fl-36r, so the prices match, and the olympus work i have seen has inspired me more than the work folk have posted from the panasonic.
the panasonic lumix lx5 is an excellent example of how to get a digital camera right, and really sets the benchmark when it comes to the serious compact camera.

handling hopefully the specifications and features of each camera has  given you an idea of what each of these cameras offers, but it all becomes  quite mute if the cameras are unable to offer the speed and image quality to  back it up.
unfortunately that size comes at a price, and the most noticeable downsides to the s95's size is the lowest battery life, rated at 200 shots, the camera's slippery when held, and the lack of optical zoom while recording videos.
overall the panasonic lumix lx5 delivers excellent image quality, excellent build quality, excellent lens, rapid performance, and expansion options, making it an exceptional choice for any serious photographer, and is therefore my "editor's choice" and deserves high praise.
it's nice to see how good all 3 cameras are.

to address the point about the canon's handling, there is a guy in the usa called richard franiec who makes an add-on grip for the s95 (and it's predecessor, the s90, which i have) which works really well and improves the handling a lot.

the nikon coolpix p300 is the cheapest, from £249, while thecanon powershot s95, is around £299, and thepanasonic lumix lx5 is the most expensive of the three, at around £349.

iso100 the lx5 allows you to photograph your subject when it is just 1cm in front of the lens, producing excellent results.
the lx5  does well at iso3200 although the processing of the noise appears more visible.

the p300 follows on from that, producing warm, rich colours, while the s95 produces the warmest colours of all with a yellow shift to the image.

the p300 produces an image that has a slightly yellow tone to it, however colour is very good.
the canon  is the smallest with full manual support, including raw, but unfortunately  suffers from the lowest battery life, least grip-able body, and doesn't allow  the use of optical zoom in videos, however, if you need the smallest camera  with manual controls it's worth a look.
the canon powershot s95  provided around 200 shots in real use, which matches the cipa rating.
the reviewer also mentioned the low battery life as an issue.

the panasonic lx5 is the most flexible and  advanced with support for hot-shoe, and produces the highest quality images.
if canon could improve on these downsides with the next model (s100?), and perhaps add a flash hot-shoe, then canon would be onto a winner.

nikon coolpix p300 winner at... high speed shooting and video... very good image quality with bright saturated images, also the second smallest camera, but importantly offers hand grip at the front and back (unlike the s95), and offers the lowest price.
further to this is features a well laid out menu system with an abundance of options, including numerous video options, and comes with a leather neck strap.
outside shots nikon coolpix p300 canon powershot s95 panasonic lumix lx5 iso160 iso100 iso100 here the nikon has produced the warmest most vibrant colours, followed by the panasonic lumix lx5, which has produced the most life like colours, while the canon has produced slightly cooler colours.
however, it's when you start delving deeper into the camera's  specifications that you realise you are looking at three quite different  cameras.
the lx5 has  the most detail with excellent detail in both bright and shadow areas, with the  s95 giving slightly softer results, and less detail in the shadow areas.
the build quality is exceptional.
you just recharge it before a big day out.

the lx5 does well at iso3200 although the processing of the noise appears more visible.
detail on the canon powershot s95 shots are very good.
to test this we took 6 or more shots and calculated the average,  so that consistent results were produced, we also made sure to test all the  cameras at the same time to ensure the cameras were being tested under the same  conditions.
we tested each camera's performance at focusing, shutter response, shot to shot time, continuous shooting etc, and have posted the results below.
the p300 offers the highest resolution  video at full hd, and also offers high speed video recording.
features you'd be forgiven if you got confused looking at the  cameras, as they, in appearance at least, all appear to offer roughly similar  features, with a wide angle optical zoom lens, a bright lens, 3 inch screens,  and pop up flash.
the nikon coolpix p300 with smaller  sensor produces good results, better than some expected thanks to the backlit  cmos sensor, and extremely rapid performance in the form of 8fps shooting, high  speed video and full hd video recording, and is thereforehighly  recommended (and a close second).
the canon is the smallest with full manual support, including raw, but unfortunately suffers from the lowest battery life, least grip-able body, and doesn't allow the use of optical zoom in videos, however, if you need the smallest camera with manual controls it's worth a look.
auto white balance performance - fluorescent lighting nikon  coolpix p300 canon powershot s95 panasonic lumix lx5 iso160 - awb,  fluorescent iso100 - awb, fluorescent iso100 - awb, fluorescent the s95 produces excellent results under fluorescent lighting, followed by the  lx5's slightly cooler results.
iso100 the p300 and s95 zoomed in has very  similar telephoto reach, with the s95 zooming the furthest to an equivalent of  105mm.
the p300 and lx5 both feature dedicated video record buttons and let you use the optical zoom while recording, while the s95 only has digital zoom while recording.
lens performance (wide-angle)
the nikon coolpix p300 packs almost every feature  imaginable and then prices it less than the competition!
the p300 follows on from that, producing warm, rich  colours, while the s95 produces the warmest colours of all with a yellow shift  to the image.
i have owned the s90 for years and never was this an issue for me.
the lx5 zooms the least, to 90mm equivalent.
as an owner of the s95, i got around the "lack of optical zoom while recording videos," by using the custom firmware chdk hack allowing optical zooming and manual focus.
i've taken the s90 all over the world and have never had a problem with the battery.

iso100 here you can see the difference between having a 24mm equivalent lens and a  28mm equivalent lens, with the s95 in the middle showing less of the scene than  the others.
the p300 offered the softest results, with the stronger contrast causing detail to be lost in the shadow areas of images.

is that the opposite of color sound?

it's worth noting that the iso range of the p300 is the lowest, ranging from iso160 to iso3200, the s95 goes from iso80 - 3200, while the lx5 goes from iso80 upto iso3200 at full resolution, with iso6400, and iso12800 available at 3mp.

posted: 28th march 2011 add comment  jargon buster:  off features performance verdict the introduction of the new nikon coolpix p300 is the  latest compact camera designed to offer manual controls and improved image  quality, yet does it have the image quality to knock the canon and panasonic  aside?
digital camera - black (3.0 inch tft lcd  display, 1/1.63 inch ccd, f/2.0 leica summicron lens with 3.8x optical zoom)  available fromamazon uk for £298.99 lexar memory was used in  this review.
unfortunately that size comes at a price, and the most noticeable  downsides to the s95's size is the lowest battery life, rated at 200 shots,   the camera's slippery when held, and the lack of optical zoom while  recording videos.
to get a feel for these advanced compacts i borrowed a canon s90, and i am surprised that a quick-reaction firm like canon has not addressed certain shortcomings of the s90, like not having a hot-shoe, when designing the s95.

the sensor is smaller than both the lx5 or s95 so i was nervous about making this purchase but nikon have worked wonders with the backlit sensor and low light results are amazing.
it offers excellent image quality thanks to the brilliant 24mm leica f/2.0 lens, larger than standard ccd sensor, and reliable image processing which can be seen in the superb auto white balance performance, and noise results.
we have broken down the main features  into an easy to read table, showing the best highlighted in green.
portrait shots  with flash nikon coolpix p300 canon powershot s95 panasonic  lumix lx5 portrait with flash portrait with flash portrait  with flash the s95 flash seemed to overexpose the image  slightly, this was made worse by the screen on the back showing the image as  brighter than it actually was, and the shot also shows the worst red-eye of the  three cameras.
the canon powershot s95 is the most compact and features a larger than normal 10 megapixel ccd sensor, an f/2.0 - 4.9 wide angle lens starting at 28mm equivalent, and again a high resolution 3 inch screen.
the p300 offers the highest resolution video at full hd, and also offers high speed video recording.
this month we want you to capture 'nature' in all its beauty!
the panasonic lumix lx5 is  an excellent example of how to get a digital camera right, and really sets the  benchmark when it comes to the serious compact camera.
while the nikon coolpix p300 is the fastest shooting with a backlit cmos sensor and 8fps shooting, and also offers the highest resolution video.
how the strengths and weaknesses  apply to you depends on what you want from a camera, and if you want the  smallest camera of the three, then the most obvious choice is the canon  powershot s95.
with two of them the strengths are most obvious, with another, the weaknesses are the most apparent.

unless something has drastically changed from the s90, i don't see this as an issue at all.
panasonic lumix lx5 winner at...
nikon coolpix p300 canon powershot s95 panasonic lumix lx5 megapixels 12 10 10 sensor type backlit cmos ccd ccd sensor size  1/2.3 inch 1/1.7 inch 1/1.63 inch iso range (full size) iso160-3200  iso80-3200 iso80-3200 (extends) raw
in other words, there aren't really any negatives about the s95.
with two of them the strengths are most obvious, with  another, the weaknesses are the most apparent.
the lx5 is to be commended for excellent focusing speed, and general all round quick performance, whilst not as quick as the p300, the 2.5fps continuous shooting is still adequate, and the rest of the performance figures are good.
where the nikon difference comes, is in the high speed 8fps shooting and full hd video recording.
the  camera gives great expansion potential thanks to the flash hot-shoe, and  rear accessory port.
the panels for the s90 cost $12.95 plus postage, so not excessive.
the canon offers a  clever dial around the lens, raw support and customisable buttons.
2fps (~) each camera excels at something, most  noticeably the p300 with the fastest start up time, and fastest continuous  shooting (by a long shot).
