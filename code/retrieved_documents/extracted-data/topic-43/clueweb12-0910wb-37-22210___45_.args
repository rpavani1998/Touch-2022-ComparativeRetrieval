i want the best camera for the images i want to make, and i want it to be comfortable, intuitive, light, and reliable.as all newer m43 cameras start at iso160 or iso200 that means that a m43 can give good enough quality just on base iso setting.it gives full functionality with decent external control and most most importantly way better image quality than any m43 currently in market.i do need a camera which assists me to focus manually efficiently and precisely, like what canon or nikon offer in their $1000 – $2000 bodies.it has plus and minus points, but in terms of overall image quality it looks as if it will be on a par with other good small-sensor 16mp cameras.the small micro 4/3 sensor can never give good enough image quality at settings above iso200.that is the ideal place to shoot with a fuji, in that environment it should be vastly superior to any mft and better then any dslr camera from the big two.it’s still a different camera than the yet-to-be-seen om-d series, more expensive and likely meant for more leisurely shooting, not stabilized, not weatherproof, but probably capable of very high image quality.they certainly have the capability to design and build any kind of camera that they think will sell, and they can’t help having noticed that there’s money to be made here.buying a kit lens separately without a body has always cost a lot more than the price difference between the body only camera and the camera with kit lens.the high iso prints that fuji presented already demonstrate that the image quality at high iso values beats much larger sensors than its own.yes, they are photographers who were hand-picked by fuji to be among the first users of a highly-sought-after new camera.i hope they haven’t done any cost cutting in the wrong areas and that this does not affect the durability of the cameras, which i think was very good on e-system cameras.the fuji x100 is now worth about 750 euros secondhand and in perfect condition.3) all modern cameras produce excellent results, so choose one that suits you, and don’t obsess over quasi scientific tests.
