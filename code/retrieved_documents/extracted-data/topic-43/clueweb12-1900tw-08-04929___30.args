reply hi nassim, i love your work and photography tips.
i personally shoot the 50mm lenses at near maximum aperture to get a shallow depth of field, so the improved performance at wide apertures is very important for me.
the new 50mm f/1.4g lens has 9 rounded blades, producing a much more pleasant round-shapedbokeh.
hi mr. nasim, your post is very informative..
i would like to use it for portraits, pictures of my friends, random awesome objects i see in my day to day activities and to a lesser extent band photography.
the only key difference worth noting is that the new 50mm af-s lens has a larger barrel compared to the old 50mm lens.
however, i think would like to go for a prime lens as to get a better indoor portrait of my baby.
reply hi nasim, finally i got my af-s 50mm 1.4g. amazing results.
thanks nasim for nice articles and lens comparison.
i know i gain some speed but the 60mm is a pretty sharp lens, and i wouldn’t be gaining much if i was looking at the 50mm 1.8 which you and others recommend over the 1.4.
i have a d300, d700 and d3s and found that this lens performs flawlessly on all nikon bodies.
if you want to use auto focus, you must buy an af-s, because the d40 haven’t micromotors on body to do focus.
upgrade now or later when i get my fx.reply eric, upgrade later when you get fx – the nikon 35mm f/1.8g is a great lens for dx.reply thank you for your article, i really love it.
reply thank you for this article, it answered all my questions about upgrading.
the 35mm lens is very inexpensive and delivers superb image quality on a dx body.
very sharp and contrasty, good bokeh (not as beautiful as the 1.4d obviously).reply hi mr nasim, first of all, your site is truly magnificent for a newbie photographer like me.
i already sent it for calibration it still back focuses on the other af point are you using also a d90?reply marvin, the center focus point is always going to be more accurate than others, but you should not get a backfocus with all other focus points.
reply bruno, sorry for a late response – get the 58mm b+w filter for the lens and you will not be disappointed.
the nikon 50mm f/1.4g is newer and certainly sharper than the 50mm f/1.4d, especially when shooting at maximum aperture.
thanks brian brian, those lenses are good for portraiture and reach (wildlife, etc), but not for wide-angle photography.
it gave me so many great pictures and i still use it quite a bit on our d300 body.
she loves the fact that the lens is very compact, light and yet produces stunningly beautiful images.
reply nasim and shalom, i owned both nikon 35mm f/1.8g and nikon 50mm f/1.4g on my d90.
buying 35mm f/1.8g is not an option for me, at-least now :(.reply mujahid, it would be tough to get 100% accurate focus at maximum apertures due to shallow depth of field.
in terms of getting a portrait lens, the 50mm f/1.4g is excellent and my favorite of the group, but it might feel a little too long on a dx camera like d90.
i use it for about 80% of my shooting (as my walking around lens) except for the 20% times i need longer reach where i use the 55-200mm.
p.s. also like to take family pictures……reply tom, if you are shooting headshots or half body shots, the nikon 50mm f/1.4 is ideal, even on dx.
hence you would need af-s with built in motor in the lens itself.
i also have the 50mm 1.8, 85mm 1.8, and a sigma 70-300 f/4-5.6 apo dg macro.
to be honest, im truly zero in dslr.
of course the 50f1.4 price is higher than 35f1.8.
sigma zoom master 35-70mm af-s 3.5-5.6f and a nikkor 50mmaf-s 1.8d so far great pictures no regrets.
although the focus speed is slightly slower when compared to theolder 50mm af-d lens, there are many more benefits to the new 50mm lens, including increased sharpness and better bokeh.
in my experience, the sensor will collect dust eventually after years of use anyway, and a advanced amateur photographer has to have the tools and know-how to clean the dust by his own.
reply hi nasim with your advice, i bought a d90 and loving it totally.
when i tested both cameras to focus from infinity to a nearby object, it was very clear that the newer lens acquires focus slower than the older version.
bokeh (background blur): the older f/1.4d lens has 7 straight blades in its diaphragm, which results in aheptagon-shaped bokeh.
thanks, dave name * email * website notify me of followup comments via e-mail notify me of new posts by email.
i have bookmarked your site for future articles.
you have mention a few times about the 50mm 1.4 giving a barrel look.
i have a 50mm 1.4 af-d with a d90 most of the times it doesn’t focus accurately most of the time it backfocus…reply marvin, that’s very unfortunate.
d f1.4 d, however, although some photos are great, i’m also producing a lot of blurry ones too.
it is very very helpful.
here are the reasons why i went with the 16-85: 2 ed and 3 asp, compared to 1 ed and 1 asp in 18-105, much better build quality, metal mount, rubber dust gasket seal (it is important), vrii, sharper (particularly in the corners – very important for me), distance scale, less distortion & the extra 2mm.
otherwise, go for the 35mm or shorter focal length lenses.
i was expecting the new “af-s” version to be faster, but unfortunately, it is actuallyslower than the older lens.
i was trying to decide firstly between the 1.8 and 1.4 and then between the 1.4d and g, but you’ve definently steered me to the 1.4g. i primarily take newborn photography but also want to get some great outdoor portraits-i must say i’m in love with good bokeh
if you just need a lens for general photography, get the nikon 35mm f/1.8g.
in that regard, the 35mm f/1.8g is better, since you can fit a lot more into the frame.
you definitely do not want to buy the imported version – it is the same as a “grey market” version, which means it will come with no warranty of any kind.
the reason i ask is that there seems to be rather large price differential between the 1.4 and 1.8reply asha, the 50mm f/1.8d lens will work great for food photography, as long as your camera has an autofocus motor.
so this 38mm f/1.8 g is more suitable to my d90.
the nikon 50mm f/1.4g is a great lens that i use more than any other and it will serve you well for the type of photography you want to do… hope this helps.
the barrel (not sure of the correct terminology) shakes.
i’m having trouble in low light situations getting the sharpness that i want.
yes, i have also heard about low performance of the 16-35mm on the d3x, so i would not take the risk.
amolreply will this lens work on a d70?reply hello nasim, i just discovered your blog and i have to say, you have a passion for photography.
but i could actually take nice indoor close-ups without having to get too close to the people (got more natural poses) 3.
handling and weight: both lenses are very lightweight (new 290g, old 260g) and are both great to handle.
you can order thru amazon if you are willing to wait for shipping.
anyway, great site – will be back more often!reply trissa, thank you for your feedback!
please let me know if the nikon af-s 50mm f/1.4g will be best suited for d200.
,all i want to know is is it worth the $ 150 extra for 1.4 g when i have d90 in which autofocus will work for 1.4 d right?reply siju, sorry for a late response.
while you might get a slightly better performance with the two lenses separately, having to constantly change lenses is inconvenient and will add more dust to your sensor.
i have a nikon d200 and have the 50mm af-d lens right now.
i find mine almost as good as the 50 1.4 your site is very interesting, well donereply daniel, the nikon 50mm f/1.8d is also good, but not as good as the f/1.4 when it comes to bokeh.
for now i need to study more on my d90 plus its kit for a moment and really love it so much.hehehehe thanks obi and nasimreply no problem jeff, enjoy your d90!reply i had a quick question for you.
thanks zoran, that’s because you probably have it set to “single” mode and your autofocus is set to only shoot when your subject is in 100% focus.
im waiting for tomorrow… ;)reply harmanizan, i would take a serious look at the nikon d5000 with the nikon 35mm f/1.8g dx lens as a combo for your first dslr purchase.
reply nasim, first of all thanks for the great blog.
wochomi, i’m glad you like your d90 – it is a terrific camera and it looks like it won’t get updated until next year anyway, so you shouldn’t feel too bad about the d7000.
in response to zoran’s question, i also have sometimes trouble with auto focusing with 50mm 1.8g. i then try to focus on contrast area to set the focus there?reply hello nasim: this is the most complete article that i could found!!
after that considering your reviews i want to buy a 16-35 vr which would be great with 50mm
regards raj raj, both lenses are comparable, but don’t forget that the 50mm is an f/1.4 lens, so you can get some really nice shots at very shallow depth of field.
enter your email address to subscribe to this blog and receive notifications of new posts by email.
but they say that lens has problems with high resolution of d3x.
btw, i bought the 24-120mm f4 after reading your article.
do not worry about the difference – 50mm f/1.4d is still a beautiful lens.
maybe i will compromise on speed on lens.
you got seriously nice pictures in here.
if you do, then your camera might be the problem…reply mr nasim, can you share your thoughts on other types of lens i.e. fish-eye len between dx and fx format.
it is a little expensive, but totally worth it.
i bought a kit lens although i know it’s not fantastic quality.
i chanced upon your site by accident while searching for infos on 50mm f/1.4g. i need your advice.
reply i just got the d90 with the 18-105 a week ago and yesterday ordered the 50mm/f1.8d (only $125).
i can’t seem to capture the orange and reds in the same mannor when taking sunset pictures.
yes, 35mm f/1.8g is a great start!reply hi nasim, i am a novice at slrs and professional photography.
i personally found this a little annoying on the older lens, because dust particles would occasionally get in between.
the vrii helps a lot with low shutter speeds.
1.4 d images are sharper and is a better lens than 1.4 g..it seems to be the sharpest among 50mm leans except for the bokey..is that true..which one do i but..as i am having d90 do u think 1.4 d will give me good resultsreply siju, where did you see in reviews that the 50mm f/1.4d is sharper than 50mm
i have ordered the nikon 50mm f/1.4g lens and want to buy a filter for it.
the price for 50mm/f1.4g or d was too high.
i was been searching a lot because i am interesting in buying one, i am a beginner photography’s student in mexico, i have the nikon d5000 and the classical 18-55 and a 55-200, but they are not enough i need better pics with the minimal light so that i need very lightly lens, i was hesitated between 1.4d and 1.4g. thanks!!
it is not heavily noticeable though and can be fixed in post-production, if it becomes an issue.
d90 however does have it in the body.
optics and sharpness: optically, the new 50mm af-s lens has more elements – 8 elements in 7 groups, compared to 7 elements in 6 groups in the older lens.
at f/2.8 and above, the lenses perform equally well, although the new 50mm tends to have slightly better corner sharpness all the way to f/5.6.
they did this so it can’t be used on a manual focus camera.
see mynikon 16-35mm f/4 review to see some test samples and conclusion.
so basically portraits and also photojournalistic types of photography eventually.
so, one has to change lenses and go with a faster lens.
enjoy your 16-85mm, i’m sure it is a great lens!
what i would do, is try to shoot at f/2.8 and above and watch your focus through viewfinder while rotating the focus ring on the lens.
the only other lens i am looking at is tamron 17-50 f2.8 vc.
i have found the 85mm f/1.8 to be an excellent portrait lens (better than the 50mm f/1.8) and coupled with the 35mm f/1.8, it would provide me the capabilities of indoor low-light snapshots and group pictures (thus eliminating the need for a dedicated 50mm prime).
im still new to food photography,so i would like to know if you could share with me ,what is the best mode,iso,foucs,white balance,image quality to use on food for this camera..please email me.thanks so much.
thanks again from raleigh, nc.reply mahmood, considering that nikon is giving away $300 on the nikon d90 and 18-200mm vr ii lens combo, i would suggest getting the 18-200mm vr ii (it is a great value).
i am an ameture photographer and have a d90 to work with.
great article and it was interesting to read all the comments following.
at the moment, i’m not too sure if it would be worth the upgrade or should i spend money for other fast lens like wide angle zoom or even mid range zoom like 24-70 2.8f.
the guy at a camera store told me which one but i cannot rememebr and he wanted to sell it to me for nearly 500$. i am hoping ot purchase on online for less money.
i personally rarely shoot it at f/1.4 and would suggest to shoot at f/2.0-f/4.0.
your camera d40 doesn’t have motor to auto focus your d lens.
i have recently purchased a nikon d3000 (mostly because it fit into my budget :-| ) and am smitten by its features and capabilities.
reply niko, the nikon 50mm f/1.4g works great on any modern nikon camera, including the nikon d200.reply with your great review, i already ordered the lens and it’s coming on my way later this afternoon…
sunset panorama, captured with nikon d700 & nikon 50mm f/1.4d lens the nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s is also my wife’s most favorite lens that she uses for all of herfood photography.
i personally shoot the 50mm lenses at near maximum aperture to get a shallow depth of field, so the improved performance at wide apertures is very important for me.
let me know if you have any specific questions meanwhile…reply hi nasim, i just stumbled upon your website when i was looking for credible reviews comparing the nikon 50 f/1.4 afd versus the afs version, and i just wanted to say wow, great article.
talking about 35 vs 50 i choose the 35mm because of the price, i have not used it to much yet because i really love the 70-300, lol, but i took some good pictures with this 35mm lens also especially in low-light situations best regards,reply jorge, congratulations, you bought great lenses!
do you think that it is valuable to buy 17-35 f2.8 than 17-35 f4 vr? st river, thank you for your valuable feedback.
i can “sneaker zoom” the 50mm for the same range.
the nikon 50mm f/1.4g is an excellent lens.
so, as soon as the update came out, i pre-ordered one from b&h and started using it more than the older version for my everyday photography needs.
as for usa/imported versions, use this link for the 50mm version and this link for the 35mm version.
because of this, you will find that keeping the new 50mm lens clean is easier than the old one.
best regards,reply jorge, i have written a review of the nikon 55-300mm lens earlier, so you can check out what i think there.
reply hi nasim, i would like to see a review between nikon 50mm f/1.4g vs zeiss 50mm f/1.4, very nice review i had g version and is much better than d.reply i’m using oldie 50mm e series f1.8, a nice…small and very ligth lens, but still had no chance to compare it with others like af-d or s f1.8.
i was very excited when the newnikon 50mm f/1.4g came out, because i loved the older version and couldn’t imagine how good the new one would be with all of the new enhancements that nikon has been adding to their line of lenses.
i guess that 35mm f/1.8g is more value for my learning curve.
i have a nikon d300 (the older version not the video one) and i have found that this lens is not only lacking it’s sharpness that you seem to achieve with many of your images but also the autofocus is off.
yes, i would keep the 24mm f/1.4 – it is certainly nikon’s sharpest wide angle lens.
and this lens actually has less distortion than the supposed upgrade.
hopefully, i wouldn’t want to upgrade too soon to yet another lens.
nasim i am usin a nikon d90…i am confused bw 50mm 1.4 g or 1.4 d….from the reviews came to know
i would certainly get the 24-70mm f/2.8g to go with the d3…i just came back from a short trip to yellowstone and i once again realized that it is my top pick for landscape photography.
i personally like and recommend both lenses a lot!reply hi nasim enjoy your site very much.
i have just received, as a very nice gift, a nikon d3x with the standard 24-70 2.8g ed lens.
reply yeow, shooting the nikon 50mm f/1.4g @ f/1.4 can yield soft results due to a) shallow depth of field and b) improper focus.
pls advice siju siju, yes, the nikon 85mm f/1.8d is an excellent lens for portraiture.
i’ve bookmarked your site and will return regularly!reply thank you for your feedback nicolas, i’m glad you are enjoying that 50mm f/1.4g
i found portraits are diluted in contrast at f1.4 apertures.
hey i have been goin through the reviews of nikon 85mm 1.8d lens…found that this is one of the best in nikons,have u tried this out..it seems it is pretty sharp at almost any aperture..
i have a nikon d3000 with a nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6g vr af-s dx, and i am about to buy 2 more lenses.
i am very sorry to hear that your camera gear got stolen… in terms of replacing your 50mm f/1.2, i think you should definitely give thenikon 50mm f/1.4g a try – the af is something you will definitely enjoy after working with a mf lens for a long time.
aperture ring: the new nikon 50mm f/1.4g is a “g” lens, and therefore, has noaperture ring (the old one does).
i was very excited when the newnikon 50mm f/1.4g came out, because i loved the older version and couldn’t imagine how good the new one would be with all of the new enhancements that nikon has been adding to their line of lenses.
the 18-200 is an excellent lens for someone who wants the convenience of a larger zoom range with vrii, doesn’t want to change lenses and risk dust on the sensor.
thank you kindly, i appreciate your dedication regarding photography and reviews.
for photographing my kids indoors that move non-stop, the new af-s version focused almost as fast as the old one and i did not see any focus problems with it.
reply harmanizan, the 18-105mm lens is a good general lens for wide-angle and medium telephoto work.
great difference in price and quality obviously.
in future, i will buy a wide lens for landscape.
i finally decided on the 16-85 vrii and i am happy i did.
your website is very nice, good luck with your photography! :)
f1.4 however at this aperture the center is soft.
based on what u have writing before, its better to spend little bit more money then invest on d90 right?
jeanne/singapore jeanne, i would not get a fisheye lens unless you have tried it and know that you need it.
it’ll be nice if you could give me an advice on which one to pick between 50mm f/1.4g af-s and 50mm f/1.4d af.
sorry!reply sirisha, get the nikon 35mm f/1.8g or nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s – both will work with the nikon d60 and d90.reply i bought the 50mm f/1.4g lens :), thanks for the tips!reply sirisha, you are most welcome!reply nice to see you sharing your knowledge and passion-
reply hi nasim, thanks for the interesting article.
she loves the fact that the lens is very compact, light and yet produces stunningly beautiful images.
in addition, the new 50mm f/1.4g is “af-s”, which means autofocus with a silent wave motor, the autofocus will function on all entry-level cameras such as nikon d40/d60/d3000 and d5000 that have no autofocus motor in the camera body (the older nikon 50mm f/1.4d or nikon 50mm f/1.8d will not autofocus on these cameras).
by the way i mostly shot nature,macro and landscapes.
would the 50mm f1.4 also be “longer” and affect it since its a crop sensor camera?reply nasim thanks for that great info.
thanks in advance, savan d. savan, the 18-55mm is a general-purpose lens, so you can take any pictures with it.
and bokeh certainly looks better on the newer “g” lens, because the older “d” lens has a 7 blade diaphragm which produces heptagon-shaped bokeh.
hi nasim, thank you for sharing with all of us your broad knowledge.
lens sharpness test at maximum aperture the new nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s is definitely a little sharper wide open than its predecessor.
for closeup photography of the food items i am looking for a lens that will show the item in vivid detail.
so, as soon as the update came out, i pre-ordered one from b&h and started using it more than the older version for my everyday photography needs.
i’m not absoluted tempted for the moment because under aps-c the 50mm it works as 75mm, and it is not a very useful focal for my work but… probably i will use my old e series in sony nex camera o similiar type with adaptor, for my d300 (future d700) i proyected 50mm f1.8/1.4 w/autofocus to replace my sigma 30mm f1.4 (nice lens but still not perfect)…
i had no macro so i used it as one to photograph insects at a fairly close range and although i didn’t get the results of a macro, the pics were still pretty good.
the g line means that they removed a feature, the aperature ring.
it’s really nice of you to actually take time to do this.
i think i will use 18-55 for family photos so i’ll buy a 50mm f1.4 for portrait and night shooting.
i take mostly indoor photographs of kids and gatherings (with and w/o a dedicated flash).
the 18-200mm vrii is a very popular lens for obvious reasons, but if changing lenses is not a hinderance, there are other cost effective options (e.g., 18-55 and 55-200) that give better end results.
after reading all the articles on this page my head is spinning.
im working in a ship and luckily every month we are in us so we could buy something useful.
this is nice, because i now do not have to remember to change a camera switch in order to manually focus in extreme conditions.
with the new 50mm “g”, this problem is eliminated – you can either set the lens to “m/a” mode, which means “autofocus with manual override” or “m” mode, which is fully manual.
cherios… farid, don’t buy the nikon 50mm f/1.8d, because it will not autofocus on your d3000.
i’ve check the speed to make sure it’s not too slow – one example of a blurry portrait was taken in the shade at f1.4 speed 1/320 iso 100 and the whole image is blurry – ever so slightly but enough to be out of focus in it’s entirety.
just because they put a new model out doesn’t mean it’s an improvement.
does the 35mm come in f1.4g, haven;t seen that anywhere.
it is not the best lens in the world, but is good enough for most photography needs.
felix, philippine islands hi nasim, i recently came across your website and i am now scoping out all of your posts.
i also have the 35mm dx 1.8 lens, but i’ll sell it because i don’t use it anymore on my d3000, i only use this 50mm, or the 18-55 kit lens which came with the camera.
i also really like that lens!reply hi nasim, great site.
it is very sharp and works great for low-light environments.
well nice to hear that its more affordable yet a great lens.
you will have to buy af-s type.
thanks in advance!reply jabari, sorry for a late response.
i presently have a d90 with the 18-105 and a 70-300 mm lens.
i am using d90 and it seems to be a good portrait lens.
i’m torn between saving money and wanting to replace my gear with lenses that will have equal performance value with my old ones.
if you find yourself taking pictures of portraits more than everything else, go for the 50mm.
as for me, i recently had my gear stolen (this past monday, it kinda sucks) and i am going into this from the viewpoint of trying to recover the most necessary lenses.
looks like your 50mm f/1.4d has a front focus issue.
if you have a dx camera and you are looking for a normal lens to be used in low-light environments, then thenikon 35mm f/1.8g is excellent.
i read somewhere that nikon may stop making the 50mm/f1.8d lens since it a money loser for them, so i wanted to get it
the rebates end this weekend, so i would hurry up if i were you.
the nikon 18-70 is an excellent lens, but the lack of vr or high aperture was making me use it less and less than my prime lenses, especially indoors.
but i also enjoyed using a closeup filter for it, which would not be compatible with the new afs version (it has a 52mm filter size).
when both lenses cannot acquire focus, the time it takes for the new nikon 50mm f/1.4g to go from infinity to 0.45m (on the distance scale) and back to infinity is about twice longer compared to the older “d” version.
if it’s good i will buy this as my first purchase of dslr lense….
i agree that it is a little overpriced given that it doesn’t have high aperture on the long end, so i didn’t buy it new.
again, this is not a lens for architectural photography, so the distortion does not bother me at all.
but if you stop the lens down to f/2.0 or higher, this outlining effect pretty much disappears, making the bokeh look much smoother.
however, it is not good enough for low-light indoor photos (neither are the 18-200 or 18-105 lenses).
so much fine print to read.
i have no idea what to buy, but i do know that i don’t want a cheap quality filter that will downgrade the capabilities of my lens.
reply first to say that you have a really great website for nikon users.
i have just bought a nikon d 7000 with its kit lens 18-105 , and also a 35mm f1.8g. my main interest are indoors-portraits, parties, family, food, artifacts etc.
the little square i use to focus on something in a quick moment is off so the space below what i am focusing on is actually in focus.
okay, so from your previous post about nikon naming convention ( http://mansurovs.com/nikon-lens-nomenclature), you say that af-s lenses have autofocus built in.
i have a d70 with 18-70 f/3.5-4.5 lens.
(including all models f1.8 and f1.4), all models use a diferent optical formula.
i also have an af nikkor 85mm 1.8.
in the older af-d version, the lens barrel would change depending on the distance between the camera and the subject.
the 35mm would probably work best on the d90, because the 50mm might seem a little too long…reply hi nasim, great site and i love it!
i would appreciate to hear your recommendations!reply af-s does have an internal focusing motor.
the manual is too complicated to stand.
the lens is surely compatible, so it is most likely a front/back focus issue.
50mm f/1.4 is a great lens and will serve you well for portraits.
i think d5000 is suitable for person like me which is interested to get in here and start to take profesional picture.
omar and osman, captured with the nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s lens 1) key differences autofocus speed, internal focus motor: just like the af-d version, the new nikon 50mm f/1.4g has no internal focus motor, which is why the autofocus speed on both lenses is slow.
i think using a micro will give me more detailing as reproduction factor is 1:1 (on fx ofcourse) and i can use it elsewhere also.
i like to take close ups.
but sure this is a unforgivable lens if you do not care about the focus point.
reply mahmood, thank you for sharing, that’s a lot of great information for siju and other readers.
the 1.4d really doesn’t?reply jabari, yeah, the 1.4d does not allow focus override when set to autofocus…reply sort of an off topic question.
good luck with your photography!reply hi nasim, i using d3000 for couple of months now….
i don’t know about nikon, but the boys are too sweet:) lucky you!reply lia, thank you!
it should be cheaper, plus you don’t have to pay taxes…reply jeff, i bought mine at best buy but had to drive an hour away b/c the 4 closer stores did not have it in stock.
yes, you will lock it at minimum aperture and everything will work as expected.
if you want full body portraits, then the 35mm might be a little more practical.
this article is a comparison between the new nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s lens versus the oldernikon 50mm f/1.4d af-d. first of all, i want to start out by saying that the nikon 50mm f/1.4 is my favorite low-light and portrait lens.
it’s got me thinking that i may not really need the 24-70mm.
distortion: the new 50mm af-s has a little more distortion than the older af-d version.
harmanizan, the image quality truly depends more on the quality of light, rather than the type of lens you are using.
thanks!reply ben, go with the newer nikon 50mm f/1.4g – it is sharper and has better bokeh.
reply mr. nasim, thank you for you wise advice.
for a little more in price, you can also get the nikon 35mm f/1.8g lens, which is a great buy for a dx camera.
if i were you, i would certainly go for the nikon 50mm f/1.4g.reply thank you !!
with the silent wave motor, the new nikon 50mm f/1.4g is also much quieter than the older version.
yeah its nice to order but in my situation its so hard, i am not a us citizen.
i shot some decent pics with it in costa rica.
my mistake, i thought t was nasim who replied.lol well thanks again for yor respond atleast i had an idea now whats more apt to my d90..
the f/1.2 is a great lens, but the manual focus is something i was never comfortable with, especially when dealing with large apertures between f/1.2 and f/2.8…
thank you again for the great posts.
when shooting at maximum aperture, there is a visible amount of “outlining” in the bokeh (also present on the older 50mm lens), which is a visible line around the bokeh circle.
sharpness-wise, the 1.4g is worth the extra $150 in my opinion.
i’m still just learning but wanted to take it further.
i currently have a 50mm 1.8d. i can’t honestly say that the performance of either 1.4 is enough to make my trade up considering the price difference.
i personally favor the 50mm f/1.4g over the 60mm macro.
although the focus speed is slightly slower when compared to theolder 50mm af-d lens, there are many more benefits to the new 50mm lens, including increased sharpness and better bokeh.
vignetting/light falloff: there is moderate vignetting visible at maximum aperture (f/1.4) on both lenses, which is practically eliminated when stopped down to f/2.0.
my only downfall with the lens, was occasionally the lack of auto focus availability.
reply amazing articles, i really enjoy the food and photography articles.
i also have 35mm af-2d. i am planning to keep this as daylight lens and the new 50mm af-s 1.4g as evening and indoor lens.
if you still have it under warranty, i would send it with your camera to nikon and have them fix the focus issue.
the 16-85 is a superb lens for landscape, travel, outdoor photography, and group photos with good light.
i’ve heard the the 24-70mm is better with both.
not a concern if you are shooting digital, but you cannot use it with the older manual focus film cameras.
besides, imho, a single lens cannot give you the picture quality of a combination of primes+zooms.
and yes, the 1.4d and the 1.8d will work on the d90.reply thanks for the advice nasim….
with the $300 rebate, i wouldn’t bother looking at the 18-105.
regards raj dear nasim, thank you for your quick reply.
nikon 35mm f/1.8g – still can afford myr850, some say it’s better than 50mm f/1.8 50mm.
i’ve noticed on other forums that i’m not the only one.
if you want to cover even wider frames, you might want to get a kit lens like the nikon 18-55mm, which is a very inexpensive lens.
my 50mm and 85mm prime lenses produce much better pictures (even my sigma zoom does).
my new 50mm/f1.8d will have an aperture ring on the lens.
i would like to know, it cames with kit lense 18-105mm 3.5-5.6g. its suitable for what type of photograpy?
randi randireply randi, if you already have the af-d version of the 50mm, there is no need to buy the af-s version.
this is 1st time for me to read such a valuable blog and comments when it comes to choose the right lens for your needs.
jeff, the 50mm f/1.4g is “longer” than the 35mm f/1.8g on a d90 due to the 1.5x crop factor associated with nikon dx cameras that are not full frame (d90 is a dx camera).
lens front rotation and use with filters: while the 58mm is not a standard filter size for 50mm lenses, the good news is that the lens thread on the new nikon 50mm af-s does not rotate when the camera autofocuses.
reply hi nasim, reading so many comments and articles online actually made me more confused :).
reply not only that the 50mm 1.4d is one of the sharpest lenses you can buy so seriously don’t worry about that either.
i will probably buy the nikon 35mm 1.5 as nasim mentioned or the tamron 17-50 2.8 vc if i can spend some more (and sell the 50mm 1.8).
i know d60s don’t have autofocus in the camera body so the lenses have to have them.
if you want a fast af, i would go for the sigma 50mm f1.4.reply oops..
you can either change your shooting mode to “continous” focus or “af-c” or change your autofocus settings so that it lets you fire even when there is no focus on the subject.
what do u think of 16-85mm lens…is it better than 18-105 in pic quality…is it worth spending extra buck for that lens in place of 16-85mm siju, unless you need a wider angle, go for the 18-105mm lens instead.
since you are on a d3x, i would suggest to go with the 14-24mm f/2.8g instead, because it is sharper.
hi nasim, thanks for a very interesting comparison of the two lenses.
i think 17-35 is better than 14-24 because it can use filter to protect the lens.
glass in the new lens, sharpness-wise, the new 50mm f/1.4
as for 17-35mm, i personally found the 16-35mm to be sharper and better than 17-35mm.
sony cyber-shot 505 and loved it.
this is great, because the older version did not, and you had to buy it separately.
i just started a restaurant and need to take pix of the dishes that we introduce from time to time.
the nikon 50mm is great for portraits, but might be too long for everything else…
when it comes to flare, i found that it is quite controllable on both lenses.
if you want to take wider pictures, you might want to look into thenikon 35mm f/1.4g instead, because it is wider than 50mm.
the 18-105 produces excellent image quality according to most reviews and for a casual shooter, that should be enough given the price difference.
if the 50mm 1.4g is on par with the 24-70mm in those areas then i’ll get it and put the rest of the money i would have spent on the 70-200mm instead.
focusing in low-light situations is tough and i would suggest using the af assist lamp on your camera in “s” (single) mode to help you get better focus.
home / digital photography / nikon 50mm af-s vs af-d nikon 50mm af-s vs af-d jan 15 2010 january 15, 2010 by nasim mansurov 188 comments this article is a comparison between the new nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s lens versus the oldernikon 50mm f/1.4d af-d. first of all, i want to start out by saying that the nikon 50mm f/1.4 is my favorite low-light and portrait lens.
if you are getting the nikon 14-24mm lens, then i would skip the 24-70mm range and shoot with the 50mm, if necessary.
i have a nikon d3100 camera and want to buy a prime lens.
reply jeff, sorry for a late response, been super busy lately :( just like obi stated below, 50mm might feel a little too long because of the crop factor on the sensor, which makes it a 75mm equivalent lens.
i would not buy the s version – get the 1.4d instead, which will definitely work on most modern bodies with built-in autofocus.
i own a nikon d7000 and thinking of buying a prime lens.
at first i was put off by ken rockwell’s review which suggests the 28-300mm is a better bet than the 24-120mm f4.
as far as the lens, i personally wouldn’t buy the kit lens or the 16-85mm and would go for the 35mm f/1.8 instead…reply nasim, thanks for your fast reply.
you certainly do not want to be manually focusing a portrait lens, especially if you are a beginner.
affordable but not sure about the performance with my non af motor dslr….
on a separate note: i do not use my non-vr 18-70 lens that often now-a-days.
i’m really excited to use it on my wedding project first week of december.
i was wondering if the 1.4 would make even sharper pics.
reply hi nasim, just stumbled upon your site.
the bokeh on the 50mm f/1.4g is superb.
mattreply hi nasim, i just got my nikon d3000 body, pairing it with a couple of old manual lenses.
on thing though…my 1.8d allows me to manual focus when the camera is set to autofocus.
i have earlier used olympus om10 and liked it.
as can be seen from the below screenshots, the difference is certainly visible at maximum aperture.
i love the bokeh and soft focus it produces.
i use a d90, would the nikon 50mm f/1.4g work well on my camera.
filter size: the filter size on the f/1.4g version is 58mm, while the older f/1.4d’s filter size is 52mm.
thanks, bipin never mind, i just read on yahoo answers that i am supposed to lock the lens aperture ring at f/22 and then let the camera do the adjusting as necessary.
i mainly do families and children.
if your focus is portraits and you want to get the best-looking portraits, get the nikon 50mm f/1.4g.
will now place an order!reply hello i came across your website and liked your articles… i am using a d90 and currently have the 50mm f1.8 af-s (not g).
i mean that it’s goes to 75mm because being a dx.
reply hi siju, i struggled a lot deciding what walk-around lens to buy to go with my new d90 body when i upgraded from d70+18-70 combo.
i don’t have a warranty because i bought it from someone.
for your info, i would like to take picture of my family, landscape, close-up, and my wife as my trial modelling.
i just sold my 24-70mm f2.8 and bougt 24mm 1.4 and af-s 60mm micro g and liked it a lot but it has focus issues with d3x because of absence of focus limiter and it is to narrow for me so i am looking for 50mm af-s .i have more macro lenses so the thing i need is a mid range lens.
shooting wide open on the af-d model will also have soft corners and plenty of vignetting.
i have d5000 and 2 lenses kit: 18-55 and 55-200.
what this means, is that you will see only a certain portion of the scene, but not the whole thing, sort of like if you were looking through binoculars (except not that long).
its amazingly sharp and gr8 t0 shoot as a prime for my d90.
nikon af-s 50mm f/1.4g vs 35mm f/1.8g i’ve checked through the reviews but couldn’t really finalise what i need.
none of the other lenses you listed above currently have rebates… if you need the 18-200mm range, do not bother with getting two separate lenses.
sorry forget to mention that i am refering to the nikon 50mm f1.4d. thanks in advance.
try shooting with different focus points outside and see whether you still have af issues.
hopefully lola will publish a good article soon.
we have recently experimented with the nikon 35mm f/1.8 dx lens and we loved it so much that my wife now wants one for her food photography.
manual focus operation: one of the annoyances of the older nikon 50mm f/1.4d, was the fact that you could not manually focus the lens while it was set for autofocus – you had to change the camera to “manual” focus.
since i spent more money getting the d90, i can leverage the internal camera motor to choose a cheaper lens 2.
reply nasim, i have d5000 with 35mm 1.8 af-s dx.
omar and osman, captured with the nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s lens the new nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s is definitely a little sharper wide open than its predecessor.
reply jeff, i paid $199 at best buy, only $2 more than the amazon price of $197.
the prices are much less than the af-s version.
in your professional opinion, would you reccomend i go for the old 50mm f/1.4 to save money and go towards replacing my other 2 stolen lenses and flash unit, or to get this one for the best possible image quality, which might compare to the f/1.2?
i bought it used for a reasonable price and fortunately it is working good for me.
as can be seen from the below screenshots, the difference is certainly visible at maximum aperture.
i think you have a mistake on your article, the nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s has an internal focus motor, it has a silent wave motor, which allows it to af with cameras like nikon d40/d60 d3000/d5000.
when you do the maths i.e., 1.5 times the focal length, your effective view using the 50mm will be 75mm which is ‘longer’ than the 52.5mm that you effectively see using the 35mm f/1.8g. for this reason, i bought the 35mm f/1.8g. at only $200, its arguably the best price/pic quality value lens on the market today.
i think you should always mention the price in your reviews, either msrp or street price will do.
if you do not shoot landscapes and need a portrait lens though, i would go for the 50mm f/1.4g instead!reply nasim, after surfing all over the web for real people’s comments and review, your site is the best!
regards,reply hey, was thinking of gettin a 50mm f/1.4 prime.
thanks & god bless!reply hello, very good you article.
it is tough, but you can certainly get pretty good with manual focusing if you practice enough.
after reading your article i’m convinced the 1.4g is the one to go for.
your tips are very helpful to me.
in fact, i bought the d90 (in april-10) after getting your advice and i’m loving it (even though d7000 is out).
at f/2.8 and above, the lenses perform equally well, although the new 50mm tends to have slightly better corner sharpness all the way to f/5.6.
the framing, sharpness and saturation in your photos are stunning.
i thought about the nikon 18-200 vrii, but from all the reviews i read (and samples i saw), i don’t think it is as good.
in terms of focus zone, i use single area focus in most cases, unless i have a moving subject (in which case i would switch to dynamic area af).
i currently just have the kit lens (18-55mm and the 80-200 zoom lens).
will i get those beautiful panorama and food picture quality (as per attached by u) if i use d5000 with nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s. thanks.
after 1 week research about what u have writing, totally its help me mate..!
if you have a basic camera like the nikon d40/d40x/d3000/d5000/d60, you will need to get an af-s lens such as nikon 35mm f/1.8g. hope this helps.
may be the newer cmos sensor in the d90 creates better images.
we will be using the images on our website with a click to enlarge option.
i took it to a dealer and found that it was “overly” used.
it is definitely a good thing that you got the nikon d90 over d5000 – you got yourself a semi-professional serious camera with great features.
i’m really amazed by its picture quality, and i really love how much i can control the dof.
if you need a true portrait lens, however, thenikon 50mm f/1.4g would be a better choice.
i use it for all indoors/low-light photography and especially to photograph my two boys.
i use it for all indoors/low-light photography and especially to photograph my two boys.
an excellent resource for nikon lovers!
please help me to compare these on sharpness and versatality in taking portraits as well.
sunset panorama, captured with nikon d700 & nikon 50mm f/1.4d lens the nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s is also my wife’s most favorite lens that she uses for all of herfood photography.
