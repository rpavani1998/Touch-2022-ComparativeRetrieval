this lens, and the very similar ef 75-300/4-5.6 ii are very soft at the  corners, even stopped down.
other than that, i'll have to check out the usm lenses, since you guys speak the world of them.
it increases the performance in portraits and adds very good balance to the camera when "l" lenses are used ...
i use the  depth of field, bulb with remote control rc-1, and film leader out functions  all the time.
a child's first year canon elan ii by john m. sully, 1996 tweet though cheap, the elan ii contains two of best features from the canon  eos-1 and eos-5 cameras: (1) simultaneous af/mf with usm lenses; (2) the big  thumb wheel on the back of the body.
i expect that a distance  based system would have correctly exposed the main subject.
this is really great if you like to shoot with a wideangle and use hyperfocal distances, just set the lens to the hyperfocal distance and shoot away.
canon used the same sensor chip instead of designing a new one.
and i use a 100/2.8 tamron macro, this lens is my favorite.
i would love it if my eos 3 had controls like the elan/rebel series instead of the hold-down-two-buttons-and-turn-the-wheel-at-the-same-time-and-take-your-eye-away-from-the-viewfinder-to-watch-the-external-readout-instead-being-able-to-confirm-the-setting-by-touching-the-physical-switch.
i probable like the n-90s better, but not enough to justify the 500 dollars difference in cost.
the portion of the frame metered by  partial mode is tied to the focus point which is currently selected.
one to hold the body, one to focus the lens, and one to hold the  function/set buttons.
other than that, i feel like i made the right choice of a 'prosumer' camera -- nothing like the cost of a professional body, most of important features (except spot metering), and a good, solid body (was a little wary of the rebel's completely plastic shell) that seems quite rugged.
i was thinking about splashing out on the remote control, mainly because i want to be in more of my shots and i take ages to get in place.
however, when checking for consistent exposures across the range of f stops, (blue sky at 80mm), i noticed a white haze in the center of the frame (diffraction?) at the smaller apertures (f22-38).

andy grafton , december 13, 2000; 08:28 a.m. i've owned the eos 50e with the qd thingummy, battery pack and 28-105 usmii  lens for about 2 years.
why i should have bought an elan iie the only difference between the elan ii and the elan iie is the eye  controlled focus.
we aren't talking about digital cameras folks!
i have never used the highest available shutter speed, and the 2.5 fps motor drive is just right to catch a sharp image on the second or third frame of a slow speed hand-held shot.
i haved used them in densed forests and  cloudy areas.
of course all of this flash trickery only works with the canon 380ex which is a reasonable unit by itself.
i did do the right thing, and  spent my money on glass first (20/2.8 usm, 28/1.8
i also have  a mark i 1.8 50mm on the way from an ebay auction.
german: the minijack has one contact for "ground", another one  that corresponds to "partially depress" the shutter button and the  last one that corresponds to "fully depress" the shutter button.
i did not go for the eye-controll version, but i might just try to go back therre tomorrow and exchange it (it seems that you ppl exschange cameras so easily :p)
from what i have read on this board, and heard from my co-workers (i work at wolf camera)
i'm taking this back to canon.
in sum, it's a useful accessory, well worth its price.
in aperature priority mode (av) and shutter priority mode  (tv), you are stuck with having your flash sync permanently set at slow sync.
i contemplated the following models and came up with  the elan ii.
thanks tim angel hernandez , march 06, 2000; 01:01 p.m. tim, i only had focusing problems with the elan in two scenarios.
but about the elan...
what's a gun if you can't fire it in time.
second, the main dial of my camera has broken after 16 months of use.
it  doesn't tell you much, i generally use evalutative.
does anyone know what stores carry this grey market camera.
i do not see or hear the aperture  stopping down when i do this, and i also don't see the little rectangle in the  top left corner light up red.
i also added the 380ex flash, and i'm planning on adding a sunpak 4000 or  the 540ez later on.
could my problem be a lame battery?
even still, i returned it,  the rebel g body and the 35-80 i bought with it and now own the much-heavier  elan iie and 28-105 3.5-4-5.
it is also fast enough to catch a variety of positions of divers, race cars and jumping dolphins.
the eye control works great and is more  functional than gimmicky.
it has been exposed to more than  it was designed for and it continues to get the job done right.
these are: full time manual focusing non rotating front element metal lens mount sad to say, they all have a substantial amount of plastic in their  construction, but that seems to be pretty usual in consumer grade lenses these  days.
underneath this switch is the film advance mode switch which chooses either single shot or continuous.
actualy eos 50e makes the job that modern slr should do and the rest is  the matter of used lenses and films.
of course, a button is cheaper for canon to build.
if you don't use the built-in flash, they last freakin' forever!
now it's malfunctioning.
i leave the leader out all the time, and have used it with mid-roll rewind with no problem.
the weight probably helps to take great free standing pictures though.
on a recent trip to yosemite i was shooting in the valley near sunrise and ran into a situation where my calculation and the camera's recommendation differed wildly, with the camera recommending much more exposure than i had calculated.
i tried it out in the store and basically felt it was a gimmick given how easy it was to set the focus point manually and how well the automatic focus point selection worked.
they put that on the eos 3/1v???
so i could get wide angle shots with my nikkor 24mm lens, because my 1.6 crop digital camera makes the 24mm lens more like a 38mm lens.
i guess it will help you a lot.
the vingneting on this lens was so bad, i took a picture of a plane in  the sky and it was aweful, totally dark in the corners and you could see a  round dark halo.
i've since indulged myself by buying just about every piece of equipment i wished i had been able to buy in the poor student days.
although this lens cuts corners with a plastic mount and  lack of focusing scale, it's small, light, responsive, and decently sharp.
but, buy the iie instead of the ii because the eye-controlled dof preview is a more important feature than you might think.
it came down to personal taste, and the accessibility of  functions on the elon ii.
the same comments apply to the performance of the  20-35.
lately however, the eye controlled focus has not been reacting as quickly or as precisely as it once did.
if you want servo af, keep the button pressed until you shoot.
i normally just leave the camera in continuous mode.
the instruction manual says to look at the top left corner of the frame after the focusing point lights up.
the wired remote is useful since it doesn't self cancel after some  fixed time like the ir remote function toomas tamm , february 17, 1997; 07:48 a.m.
50e is a type a camera and hence is compatible with the ex flashes.
as a result, i need to move my head around to see the entire frame and the displays.
the eye dofp is a great tool when well used.
i quickly realized that it did not need it and would focus in much lower light than i could hand hold.
i returned the 70-300 ef not because i didn't like it, but  because i liked it so much i want to get the usm is model!
i've hand held shots at the 28mm end down to about 1/8 sec with no visible shake at all.
on many occasions i have gotten a shot i might otherwise have missed because all essential controls (especially focus-point selection, ae lock, exposure compensation, and flash exposure lock with the ex series flashes) could be operated instantly with one hand without taking my eyes off the viewfinder.
it has been knocking around africa and europe with me and lives in a pelican case when not being used.
i absolutely love it.
i'm hoping to take photos this week around the city and start playing with all the manual settings.
i have "heard" that a free repair  is available from authorized repair centers.
good things: the camera is light and controls are logically laid out, which makes camera a joy to use.
hope this helps people who just bought or is  buying into this body.
i know that the vast majority of people making a living with photography do what i do, but like the rest of you i hold out hope that i may capture some images that are salable to publishers as well.
mine has gotten knocked around quite a bit during multiple trips through nepal and through the western us.
i was thinking about  splashing out on the remote control, mainly because i want to be in more of my  shots and i take ages to get in place.
i've been looking all  over the internet to find an answer but it looks like i'm the only one that's  bothered by this.
i friend has an old one he used to take photos of night sky with long  exposures and a hand-made equatorial mount with electronic motor controlled  with a computer.
also i would like what do you think of trantor 28-200 (f3.8-5.6), it's the lens i bought with the camera, the shopper told me that it is has a very good value/cost ratio, but as i've already said i'm totally new to this, and i have little money to expend on it (mainly because i'm not confidence enough to expend more money).
it is my first  really serious camera and i settled on it after lots of research.
in the "creative zone" modes the metering mode chosen by the 3 position switch under the command dial, evaluative, partial or centerweighted averaging, is used.
i  have probably done things no self-conscious photo.net photographer would do - i  bought the following lenses with or shortly after getting the camera: tamron 28 - 300mm 3.5/6.3f quantarray 18-35mm quantarray 50mm/
of course, some models will  have more this or faster that, but do you really need 1/12,000 sec.
and the repair costs 40% of the camera price.
the instruction manual says to look at the top left corner of the  frame after the focusing point lights up.
also, the n-70 will not pop up the flash in auto mode, it will indicate that it requires the flash.
this doesn't happen all the time but often enough to become irritating.
knowing this, why am i griping?
if you want to get a rrs qr plate for an elan iie equipped with the bp-50, rrs won't sell you one, because they claim that "it's just not stable."
red eye reduction flash exposure compensation (+- 2 stops, 1/2 stop increments)
bobby downes , may 19, 1998; 03:44 p.m. i love this camera.
i bought it in germany, so it was shiped with german manual.
if you have any info on it please mail me, i would like to build the same device my friend has to use it with my elan ii.
with a 5-point  font and essentially no line spacing one can fit 10 lines of readable text into  the empty space on the left hand side of the bottom of the body (if you have  the camera, you will find the space easily).
i have found it's not often you get back a roll and all the pictures are pretty descent, this body / lens combination seems to do the trick.
i was never able to get what i would call an  elargeable slide out of it.
photo tags equipment store home > equipment > canon > canon elan ii read about nikon's current offering of flashes and accessories on photo.net.
edwyn michael walker , august 15, 1999; 11:05 p.m. in july of 1998 i finally saved up enough money to buy a canon rebel g.
this equipment has been subject to all environments and hasn't let me down once.
greg martin , april 07, 2000; 09:41 p.m. i've had my elan ii for almost a year and a half now, and i've been very pleased with it.
i really liked the pictures it produced with the 28 to 80 standard lens.
the list of features is amazing for the price.
finally this applies to both of you, go and buy the 28-135 usm is, you won't be disappointed.
i expect that a distance based system would have correctly exposed the main subject.
i live in the sticks so i haven't  tried it.
it's a six-car pileup at the intersection of art and commerce and the amount of opinion and hyperbole that is somehow labeled as... by john m. sully, 1996 though cheap, the elan ii contains two of best features from the canon eos-1 and eos-5 cameras: (1) simultaneous af/mf with usm lenses; (2) the big thumb wheel on the back of the body.
try attaching an l series lens, and if you'renot blocking the auxiliary light in low-light conditions, and youare focusing on  areas of adequate contrast, and you'restill having the same problem,  well then your camera probably isn't working correctly.
also, the eos 5 command dial isn't smooth which could spoil any  moment.
if you press the rewind button halfway through a roll, you're stuck with no leader.
andrei lau , june 12, 1999; 10:31 p.m. i think the elan 2e is well worth the money though there is always room for  improvement.
excellent price / performance ratio.
this is a little problem - as the camera  doesn't seem to do af correctly in low light enviroments without the af assist  beam.
i found it invaluable when i was hiking, in order to get certain shots to come out just right.
i picked it up for £240 ($400) second hand - it's the qd version, and got a 12 month warranty as well - a fair price.
i  haven't used the camera with 2cr5s, so it may just be a problem with aas.
it's  the one i take when i only take one.
but there is still one thing that i have not got to work on this camera: the eye controlled depth of field preview.
kevin han , october 13, 1999; 05:09 a.m.
for the same price you  get the buttons on eos-5, so i thought...
thanks and congratulations for your page, it's very  informative (wish i've found it before buying my camera :-) - german vinicius matangrano , february 27, 2000;
fun in medium format becomes tiresome and expensive.
german: the minijack has one contact for "ground", another one that corresponds to "partially depress" the shutter button and the last one that corresponds to "fully depress" the shutter button.
if you don't want it, release the button when focus is achieved, then recompose.
although this lens cuts corners with a plastic mount and lack of focusing scale, it's small, light, responsive, and decently sharp.
i  was playing around with it and i don't find it too reliable (this is with the  on-camera flash, not with an ex).
excellent photos depend more on the lens and tripod, but this camera body is more than adequate as a basic building block of a real system.
speaking of elan 7 focus problems, would ya like to know why people have been having problems with the elan 7 af system?
it's fascinating to read these old reviews; possibly the only place where someone has a good word for the old 20-35mm f/3.5-4.5.
realy sharp, it makes a good combination with the eos.
i have no previous experience with slr cameras (in fact i discover this page searching for help on them) although they always fascinated me.
most older cameras use a mechanical counter when the  gear turns pulling the film by the sprocket holes...
lately however, the eye controlled focus has not been reacting as quickly  or as precisely as it once did.
eric joerg michael , march 27, 1999; 07:01 a.m. i just got the eos 50e last week.
overall: great camera, logical controls and good price/value.
it performed excellently and never once gave me a problem.
the elan 7 has little to offer over the elan ii.
i have the elan iie and love it.
i was pretty happy with it - until i got my hands on the elan ii.
i would strongly recomment this camera to any serious amateur like myself  who wants to learn, explore and enjoy photography.
metering is consistent, but underexposed.
it is proven technology, and it works.
in the pic modes only evaluative metering is used, except for close  up mode which uses partial metering.
i've had an elan iie as my only camera for  over 4 years, and have gotten to know its strengths and faults very well.
p.m. i've used this camera for the last 3 years on a daily basis shooting for 3  magazine publications.
it's not as easy and fast as the back button, but it works.
and i've now got a rechargeable 2cr5  system to cover for emergencies.
i can't wait to get this solved.
however, the fogging is limited to the bottom 15% of the frame, an it may be much less with some films.
first it was the smell problem.
it works very well, all of  the controls are very east to find and use.
remember comparing this camera to highend stuff like the a2 of  even the n90 isn't really fair.
this dial is a piece of genius.
after sending camera to canon, they replaced the contacts and the upper  plate (printed on icons were coming off from my daily use).
true, there is no pc flash terminal on this  model, but i fire my studio slaves with a camera mounted unit pointed upward at  low output.
p.s.i didn't really comment on the camera cuz it looks like you all know  how great it is already.
--pratik inge stubdal , october 30, 1999; 06:54 p.m. i am back - after having used my eos elan ii (eos 50) since late september '99.
does this sound like a faulty camera or do  others experience this ?
i had  to use some paper underneath it to make contact with the poles.
i never need to take my eye away from the viewfinder to set any of the major functions (aperture, shutter speed, exposure compensation).
there is a switch just above it which enables and disables it so that you cannot accidentally set exposure compensation.
with a used elan iie going for less than $200 on ebay, there is no reason for someone to waste money on a cheapie rebel 2000; there is certainly no reason to spend $400+ on an elan 7e when you can buy two elan iie's.
to change focus point, you need to press the focus point selection button and then spin the main control dial.
michael konrad , december 31, 1999; 05:25 a.m. i think there is no more to say for the moment.
it is a truly fantastic camera for the money.
in spite of my weak german language knowledge i learned to use all its functions in no more than two hours.
and in aperature or shutter priority (and of course, manual) the meter just seems to ignore the fact that the flash is there, so you have to basically calculate the exposure by hand.
my choice was between the n-70 or the elon ii.
i trust the evaluative metering with exosure  compensation.
i did this and laminated it to the insides of all my lens caps so i always have this info available.
extremly clear and simple, so i went with this lens.
i returned the 70-300 ef not because i didn't like it, but because i liked it so much i want to get the usm is model!
the eye-control focus is a fun toy to wow friends and family, but i  hardly ever use it.
it doesn't tell you much, i generally use evalutative.
krzysztof jakub dolegowski , january 28, 2001; 03:12 p.m. i use eos 50e since 1998.
i first thought my camera was defective,  but when i had a look at other specimens in the store, they all did the same  thing.
but too bad is wasn't built though.
the camera is easy to use  and figure out, canon's usm af technology is impressive, and the fill flash  finally works pretty well for off center subjects.
i love this camera, but this autofocus issue is really a drag!
it is cheap, light and dependable.
when i want  to reenable it, i just push the button once again.
even in mf the ecf help me to find the better focus with the "audible beep" and the square af sensor i choose.
this means that i have to lug around a 20 pound camera bag
now, the shutter release is faulty.
two small problems so far.
i'm keeping it at least until canon comes out with it's vauge new bodies in the next month or two.
the price isn't so high in the us, but it is apparently costly and sometimes hard to find elsewhere in the world.
piaw na , january 24, 1998; 08:48 p.m. about the bp-50 grip.
when i got the slides back, the ones taken at the camera's exposure were hopelessly overexposed, so i think i'll still trust my own calculations in difficult light.
especially as the camera seems to use far more batteries using the pack than normal.
sanjeevan bala , may 02, 2000; 04:07 p.m. i am a complete beginner and have just purchased my first slr after years  of the point and shoot.
try attaching an l series lens, and if you'renot blocking the auxiliary light in low-light conditions, and youare focusing on areas of adequate contrast, and you'restill having the same problem, well then your camera probably isn't working correctly.
as for most people, i find cf4 is the most useful and used custom function,  i typically leave it set to 1 (af on ae lock button), but like anything else  this depends on the shooting situation i am faced with.
nothing to remember, no switches to switch.
i've had in the camera since i bought it.
: the evaluative meter isn't  always reliable in tricky lighting, but the partial meter solves that problem.
but i have  had a few shots where i felt it actually over-exposed the shot.
it is very well laid out, and i love the lockable command dial.
photoshop is much more versatile than darkroom print making.
thanks to all those who have fed back advice and comments on this camera, you have steered an enthusiastic amateur to spend even more money...
make sure that if your shooting in  low light, that you don't block theaf auxiliary light.
in addition, it adds high speed flash sync  (via pulses, up to 1/4000th) and a new flash exposure system that is slightly  less lame than previous canon eos models but still no match for nikon d (or a  $50 p&s camera's).
second, it's durable enough for  rough amateur use.
i can't  think of any other camera in which you get so much for your money.
at least this blinking can be disabled.
but i would prefer to have a custom function allowing the meter to go off longer time after each shot.
put the eos 3 in 11af point mode and it will beat the hell out of the elan 7.
i've been toying around with getting the bp-50 (the vertical grip thing) for a while, but i set cf04 for autofocus on the ae lock button, and i think the only button the grip gives me is the shutter release.
* very good handling with bp-50 *  cf02: film leader position after rewind (in or out)
wouldya?wouldya?huh?huh?
please e-mail me: inge@worshipper.com -inge
jeffery e. gale sr. -- , january 28, 1998; 12:15 p.m. seeing as how i just purchased the elan ii a few weeks ago.
my previous cameras were a pentax k1000 and before that a zeiss ikon contaflex.
for the same price you get the buttons on eos-5, so i thought...
well all that it means is that it will only be offered if it is a genuine help to picture taking.
a.m. i purchased this camera after reading the comments on photo.net.
cf02: film leader position after rewind (in or out)
these are: sad to say, they all have a substantial amount of plastic in their construction, but that seems to be pretty usual in consumer grade lenses these days.
also, if this is happening with only two lenses, it's probably not the camera.
in general i just trust the evaluative  metering if i have the misfortune to find myself shooting in the middle of the  day.
after calibration (which takes only seconds to complete) the  eye control, including dof preview, is dead on with my glasses, sunglasses, or  no glasses.
so much for that useless  custom function, duh for canon engineers).
i found out that i was loosing a lot of shots focusing the  camera, so after much research, decided to purchase the elan iie.
one thing i still haven't figured out is the benefit of using center-weighted averaging versus evaluative metering-- the 650 had only evaluative metering and usually worked quite well with both slide and negative films.
but it's not difficult to correct that.
it is very well laid out, and i love the  lockable command dial.
the alternative is to get an eos-5 and its grip, which rrs will sell you a plate for.
it turned out that the focusing beam was hitting the lenshood of the 2.8 70-200 zoom.
this can fog infrared film.
dustin trejo , october 21, 2003; 09:38 p.m.
and my 50e does not underexpose.
one controls exposure lock and the setting of the current custom function when in custom function setting mode.
it turned out that  the focusing beam was hitting the lenshood of the 2.8 70-200 zoom.
(80.00 dollars east coast).
changing the focus point is so easy and quick that eye  control focus almost isn't necessary, but more on this later.
now that the elan 7 and 7e are out, there should be some good close-out deals happening on the ii's...if you don't need the very latest thing, these are a killer camera.
minolta xtsi (no depth of field feature) canon eos 5 (a2) i spent hours at b&h in nyc and played with the a2 and elan ii.
in most modes it controls exposure compensation, but in metered manual mode it controls the aperture.
i often mf with my 100/2.8 macro and the scene snaps in and out of focus sharply and quickly allowing for easy mf operation.
opt for the 28-105usm.
or -1.5 stops of compensation.
i note however, that the situation here is considerably better than it is on the pentax 67 i've been using recently.
i got the hang of the eye control  straight away (i think), and can't wait for the first chance to use the camera  in anger....
looks like i made a good decision.
the main control dial broke.
i'm considering getting another body, in addition to this one, partly because it's nice to have two different films loaded and available, and partly because i'd like a backup.
i'm  keeping it at least until canon comes out with it's vauge new bodies in the  next month or two.
i really liked the pictures  it produced with the 28 to 80 standard lens.
i have also noticed that the little red light that makes the selected focus sensor square blink is "sloppy"; there's a blotch of red light along the bottom of the viewfinder when the square blinks.
i do like the black body instead of the ugly half silver on my elan iie.
for example, i might want to focus to the left,  but the system favors the right box.
i have used my eos50 for about a year.
p.m. i've used this camera for the last 3 years on a daily basis shooting for 3 magazine publications.
while canon has omitted a list of the custom functions from the body, one  can be easily created with a word processor and laser printer.
plus you have to look at the box in the corner  during the first few seconds after focusing.
i also have a mark i 1.8 50mm on the way from an ebay auction.
it's even quieter than my husband's a2.
make sure that if your shooting in low light, that you don't block theaf auxiliary light.
for most, wanting more than this  camera offers is just ego talking.
ai servo mode is follow focus  mode, the camera will take an exposure irregardless of whether the af circuitry  is happy or not.
also, i wanted something with a portrait grip that has a shutter button; the eos 50 seems to be the absolute cheapest film slr with this feature.
mario giberti , may 01, 1999; 10:10 p.m. i too was looking to move up from my 15 year old pentax k1000.
spot metering would be something i'd look for in a future camera...
the only thing i don't like is the custom function stuff.
i wish its mirror slap and film advance were as quiet as the a2.
it attaches to the camera by means of the  tripod socket (the bp50 has in turn a tripod socket).
i still like the elaniie very much.
for grins i decided to shoot two sets of brackets, one at my  exposure, one at the camera's recommendation.
first, canon, although many of its lenses do return distance information,  still does not use it to calculate flash exposure.
have you noticed that the f mount hasn't changed to accomodate autofocus technology prefering instead to put in something similar to pentax.
unfortunately, such a goodie is not available for the a2/elan ii,  although the same part can be used on the 1n.
andy grafton , december 13, 2000; 08:28 a.m. i've owned the eos 50e with the qd thingummy, battery pack and 28-105 usmii lens for about 2 years.
turned out there was something wrong with the  shutter.
something that i don't think has been mentioned, the dep mode is  great...
i have checked the calibration of the meter via the clear north sky at noon method and found that the meter registered the correct exposure in all of it's modes.
i wanted a wider range than the 35-80 and the 28-105 seemed to "fit" better with the elan iie.
as bob atkin mentioned about under exposure problem of eos50e, i found that most people would notice more of this issue when shooting velvia like i do.
sorry about the length of this review.
i remeber the original nikon f4 sales brochure stating that a new technology would only be incorporated in their cameras if it was tested by professionals.
i guess this would be fixed with a 380 ex flash and e-ttl flash metering... but the on-camera flash is pretty weak still.
actualy eos 50e makes the job that modern slr should do and the rest is the matter of used lenses and films.
at any rate, i've run hundreds of rolls through my elan ii, and am really  pleased with it.
the only difference between the elan ii and the elan iie is the eye controlled focus.
ai focus is a hybrid mode which normally  operates as focus priority, but if the computer decides that the subject has  begun to move it switches to follow focus mode.
does  anybody know of this?
and dont forget: every day is filled with new experiences !
you can check it by yourself testing a rs60-e3 remote switch (i recommend that you buy one, it's a very useful and cheap accessory).
the elan 7 will have focus problems in that situation.
despite the eye dofp.
i  remembered that when i was in high school and college that serious photography  was fun for me and that i was good at it, but i thought that i could be happy  with a point and shoot.
v. labolle , february 15, 1998; 08:39 p.m. i have experienced the battery problem i.e., when changing from one brand of battery to another, the camera would not work.
i would never send something so messed up to other service centers.
anyway, i think any one of the 3 elans would be more than enough for a beginner.
it would not be very hard for canon to simply add that feature into the eos3 and eos1v and release them as + models.
other than that, i'll have to check out the usm lenses, since you guys speak  the world of them.
it is a hassle to scan the negatives and then process on the computer, but i actually enjoy it.
this isn't much and some people might not notice it, but i do.
i bought it knowing that i would not outgrow it quickly like i would with a  lower end body.
anyway, back to the useful piece of information.
speed is  not important though in my current assignments.
i've rediscovered a very satisfying hobby and am taking better photos than i ever have, mainly because i am now able to afford all of the equipment i wanted but couldn't afford when i was a poor student.
they only have it in europe(france).
you can check it by  yourself testing a rs60-e3 remote switch (i recommend that you buy one, it's a  very useful and cheap accessory).
maybe when i upgrade in  the fall.
remember comparing this camera to highend stuff like the a2 of even the n90 isn't really fair.
while every positive comments above regarding this camera is true, i traded mine in for an a2 after a year.
after reading all the hyped comments about the elan iie, i bought into them.
i recently used my friends 380ez flash, and it took great pictures.
it is very competitively priced for what it is.
i haven't tried it out yet.
now, at the end of the  summer, i decided to move up.
i also like the elan ii  very much.
it  performed excellently and never once gave me a problem.
the executive summary on this camera is: in this price range it can't be beat.
after only a few calibrations, it's  working like a charm.
i probably would have been much happier with it.
i guess it  will help you a lot.
and it had a built in lightmeter.
the "no battery" symbol blinks everytime i expose the first frame, indicating that something's wrong (according to the manual).
why didn't i choose the elan 7?
a.m. i have had the canon eos 50e for about 4 or 5 years now.
i was originally going to buy a new elan ii but the store got a used iie in
combine this with a very easy to use interface and you are looking at a real winner in the mid price range.
the classic complaint from eyeglass wearers about canon cameras still applies to the elan ii: there isn't enough eye relief.
the really outstanding feature of these lenses is the full time manual focusing.
this lens is so sharp, so contrasty and it's color rendition so brilliant that it is worth every penny of the $600 i spent on it.
i took some pictures with it and was not very satisfied with the results, preferring the output from a p&s camera.
this is most noticable when shooting in low light.
i am from the 35mm film camera era and am use to developing and printing at home.
unless  your a professional i wouldn't recommend it, just because it's too heavy.
e-ttl is canon's answer to  that.
: the evaluative meter isn't always reliable in tricky lighting, but the partial meter solves that problem.
i got the hang of the eye control straight away (i think), and can't wait for the first chance to use the camera in anger....
rich buttiglieri , april 07, 1998; 03:33 p.m. you can't use ir film because the frame counter in side uses an ir beam to count the sprocket holes.
anyway,  i think any one of the 3 elans would be more than enough for a beginner.
but hey when you get into photography, you either make yourself poor buying  stuff or it sits in a closet somewhere collecting dust.
so far i've had a grand total of 1 picture out of focus, and that was because i was too close to my subject and hoped that the dof of a 24mm lens would save me.
as of 2011 they sell for about £20 body only although i suspect that some of the ebay auctions were won by people who expected a 50d. curse you, canon, for using the same numbers!
in other modes it doesn't seem to kick in - and whatever i do with cf 7 -  it doesn't change things.
kevin han , february 13, 2000; 01:53 a.m. my eos50e is 14 months old.
the camera would then use the flash's focusing light which was not blocked by the lenshood.
the following is a quote from the eos 50/elan ii  user guide by hove foto book series isbn 1 87403 159 2 (page 32) "your camera instruction book states that infared film cannot be used  in the eos 50/e elan ii/
i often mf and the scene snaps in and out of focus sharply and quickly allowing for easy mf operation.
overall the 380ex/e-ttl system provides a substantial improvement in the quality of fill flash provided by the canon system.
this probably means that none of the cf modes will work when the camera is in one of the auto modes.
i'd rather have the three of these bodies than just one  "professional" body for the same cost.
on the top left of the camera you will find the command dial which selects  one of several different operating modes, ranging from the phd pic modes -- the  "image zone" in canonese -- to the "creative zone" modes:  shiftable program, shutter priority, aperture priority, manual and depth of  field mode.
andrzej wee keng_hor , november 28, 1999; 09:57 a.m.
i considered the sigma series of lenses but in the end went for the starter kit canon lens (28-80 usm).
i have fairly small hands and all of the controls fall readily under my fingers and the camera operates quickly and intuitively.
eye controlled focus works, but it is only usefull for slow moving/static objects.
i have hard time remembering
although you give up alot in terms of  quick composition and lens versitility, the pictures i have taken with the new  50 /1.4
do not use your camera without grip bp-50!!!
the amount of pro features you get for the money is just astounding, although anyone reading this now will probably be looking for the eos 30 which is the long awaited replacement for the eos 50e.
the elan 7 is a significant increase over the elan iie's ecf speed (i didn't use ecf on my elan iie).
p.m. i've owned my elan iie for more than a year now
couple weeks ago, i also got the original elan.
i have checked the calibration of the meter  via the clear north sky at noon method and found that the meter registered the  correct exposure in all of it's modes.
the  weight probably helps to take great free standing pictures though.
however, after a strict period of shooting velvia with this body, i noticed 1/3  stop under exposure problem on other film like elite 100 as well which i had  used to test this new system.
if you don't want it,  release the button when focus is achieved, then recompose.
i've since indulged myself by buying  just about every piece of equipment i wished i had been able to buy in the poor  student days.
generally, in tricky lighting i switch to using a handheld 1 degree spotmeter and use the camera in manual mode.
thanks to  all of the advise from phil and all of the other people posting here and in  other related sites, i bought a elan iie with a 28-105 lens.
the frame rate has been boosted, perhaps a dandy little feature for some rich guy who wants to have a camera that shoots faster than yours, but people who really need the frame rate would be buying an eos3/1/1v/1n/1rs or an f5/100.
this lens, and the very similar ef 75-300/4-5.6 ii are very soft at the corners, even stopped down.
[ed: the new canon 180/2.8 usm is an even nicer lens, but alas costs $1600.]
the eye-control is godsend.
the n70 is pretty much foolproof, but the controls were  not at all intuitive.
this probably isn't noticable in most scenes, but i'd be curious if anyone else has seen this.
off center subjects are handled well with results which are identical to those gained for centered subjects.
with the camera doing exactly what i expect it to do, all i have to do is concentrate on composing pictures!!
i also found there was lots of distortion in the corners at  the wider angles.
it's just a switch or has some kind of electronics on it?
that took canon more than a month.
both of these lenses represent very good value for your optical dollar, sure they could be faster, but then they would cost $1500 each instead of $325 and $450, so don't complain.
if you set  it to leave film leader out after rewind, it only works when you reach the end  of the roll and the camera starts to rewind automatically.
the elon ii will pop up the flash whenever it deems flashing appropriate (you  can close it again, and it won't use it - but the pop-up engine makes a little  noise.
it falls into the same category as say the n70  or even the n60.
with that in mind, i ordered the bp50, which retails for about $60 at the merchants listed in photo.net.
thanks and congratulations for your page, it's very informative (wish i've found it before buying my camera :-) - german vinicius matangrano , february 27, 2000;
as a matter of fact, i am shopping for a used one for backup.
i think so and to prove a point i have three eos cameras 620, 10 and 50e. all have diferent modes of operation but still basically deliver the goods time after time.
first, some brands of batteries dont work with the camera !!!
but i have had a few shots where i felt it actually over-exposed the shot.
as for the leader-out debate, i read somewhere that you must be in one of the creative zone settings for mid-roll rewind to leave the leader out.
the elan7e has 7 focusing points and the eos 3 has 45!
the wired remote is useful since it doesn't self cancel after some fixed time like the ir remote function toomas tamm , february 17, 1997; 07:48 a.m.
i think it's a great camera - for my little experience with such  cameras.
for grins i decided to shoot two sets of brackets, one at my exposure, one at the camera's recommendation.
but i would prefer to have a custom function allowing the meter to  go off longer time after each shot.
now i put my lithium battery into bp 50 (you can switch an inside adaptor to make it), and have good handling and sure power!
anyway, i'd say it's a great camera!
i find i like the eye-control a lot more than i thought i would, especially the dof preview activated by looking at the little parallelogram in the corner of the screen...too cool!
as the scene grows more contrasty the evaluative metering becomes less  trustworthy.
the af is, as is usual with canon, plenty fast.
also my speedlite 540ex was a good choise.
eye controlled focus works, but it is only  usefull for slow moving/static objects.
the elan iie is no doubt the best  camera in the world for its price and features.
with that in mind, i ordered the bp50, which retails for about $60 at the  merchants listed in photo.net.
well, i've had the camera for six months, and the verdict is in...
canon's previous fill flash system, a-ttl, has gotten a pretty bad rap and is certainly inferior to the nikon 3d matrix system.
this feature, when combined with custom function 4, allows you to  choose manual or auto focus as the shooting situation dictates without having  to switch the lens or the body from auto focus to manual focus and back.
now mind you, my serious work is still done with an old rb - weddings, portraits, product photos - but photography is also my hobby.
it falls into the same category as say the n70 or even the n60.
kevin kemner , march 09, 1998; 11:00 p.m. on the bp-50 battery pack you need to use lr6 batteries our the equivalent.
and i can't really recommend  it.
the fact that most of the controls are knobs that you twist or  turn mean that even in pitch black you can figure out what settings are set  where.
i'm glad that i no longer need to look at something and say: "i could have a great picture here if i only had a macro lens".
(2) it's really nice to have the option of using aa batteries via the bp-50 battery pack and grip.
i'm still waiting for it to get here, but from what i've read, i made the right choice!!
spot metering  would be something i'd look for in a future camera...
just in front of the lcd panel lies the main control dial and the shutter  release.
they appear in this order in the plug, from sleeve to tip.
it has 6 segment evaluative metering, center-weighted metering and 9.5% partial metering -- even canon wouldn't call it "spot" metering.
this selects each focus point in turn and then selects automatic focus point selection mode.
if you want  servo af, keep the button pressed until you shoot.
but my main problem is that i sometimes had much to dark pictures using  hi-speed films (fuiji 800g superpro)
it can be easy to do if you leave a lens shade attached.
all three of the usm lenses share similar construction characteristics.
the problem  could be corrected by shooting without the lenshood or by attaching the 380 ex  flash and setting the center focusing point manually.
it's called the eos 55e (noir[black]).
* only 3 af sensors but work better than eos a2e * no spot metering!!!
i often use my eos 50e with 100 macro f/2.8 usm and ml-3 ring flash for dental macro photo with fantastic results.
it's too bad canon won't let us have the black version that is  available in europe.
i've played with a lot of other cameras since, including a nikon n70, a n8008s, an eos 1n, and an eos a2e, and i have to say that by far, the elan iie is still the easiest to use camera i've encountered.
i don't regret each cent...
they only have it  in europe(france).
this is good, thoughtful ergonomic design and helps to make the camera easy to use.
the elan ii ($420) competes in price with the nikon n50 ($410) which  can't even begin to touch it in terms of features.
the elan ii is certainly lighter than the 650, and the control layout may turn out to be more convenient once i get used to it.
i bought the model without the eye focus...
i haved used them in densed forests and cloudy areas.
at 500$, it gives me, as an amateur, a good  all-round lens.
also i would like what do you think of trantor 28-200 (f3.8-5.6), it's the lens
i have never used the highest available shutter speed, and the 2.5  fps motor drive is just right to catch a sharp image on the second or third  frame of a slow speed hand-held shot.
not when put to l. had to take the batteries out and "reboot" it.
my guess is because  nikon has a patent on using focus distance information to calculate flash  exposure.
nice work, philip and the others!
true, there is no pc flash terminal on this model, but i fire my studio slaves with a camera mounted unit pointed upward at low output.
this is one  great camera, it fits like a glove in my hands, and all of the controls are  within my reach.
the elan ii is the first modern, auto-everything snazzy slr with which i've  had a lot of experience.
maybe when i upgrade in the fall.
the canon elan ii/50 (e) uses the relatively expensive 2cr5 battery.
i suppose if you put the hood on all the time it might be ok.
i played with the shutter and aperture controls and got to understand photography better.
kevin steiger , january 29, 1999; 10:57 p.m. after being an avid canon fan for many years (ft-ql, f-1, ae-1, a1), i decided to try nikon.
i've graduated from the pic modes (portrait, landscape, etc) and find myself using the programmed and dep mode mostly.
some of us aspire to a eos1 and its variants, and the lovely features this camera offers but just how much of this technology is going to be used??
there are few industries as heart-wrenching as the fine art business.
(studio photos are really the realm of medium format anyway!).
anytime i go out for a serious shooting session.
i'd rather have the three of these bodies than just one "professional" body for the same cost.
this is particular problematic when exposure compensation is  set, that do not allow time to reset it to normal.
seems  to happen more often indoors.
what i hadn't  counted on was the eye controlled depth of field preview.
this means that i have to lug around a 20 pound camera bag anytime i go out for a serious shooting session.
i've found most comments in this section to be helpful.
i do, however, have several small gripes: 1.
in most modes it controls exposure compensation, but in  metered manual mode it controls the aperture.
first, canon, although many of its lenses do return distance information, still does not use it to calculate flash exposure.
but there is still one thing that  i have not got to work on this camera: the eye controlled depth of field  preview.
the 28-105 is a really nice, sharp lens.
it seems to on the money every time, as  long as i do my part and pay attention to what i am doing.
i also added the 380ex flash, and i'm planning on adding a sunpak 4000 or the 540ez later on.
it is very competitively priced  for what it is.
i've had an elan iie as my only camera for over 4 years, and have gotten to know its strengths and faults very well.
the next time i had trouble, was when i  was shooting in low light with a long zoom.
i normally just leave the camera in ai focus mode.
this is great for people who like to use fill flash outdoors.
"photographers are one of the most violent groups of people, first they  frame you, then they shoot you, then they hang you on a wall.
heck the rebel was out of my price range,
if you own a canon and you take macro photographs, buy this lens, not only is it a great macro lens, but the 100mm focal length and f/2.8 maximum aperture makes it a great portrait lens as well.
i did add the bp-50 vertical grip, and i'm waiting to use up the lithium battery
it displays shutter  speed and aperture, frame number, battery status, exposure compensation (or  manual meter reading) whether or not flash compensation is set, red eye  reduction setting status, whether or not you have custom function active, mf/af  active status and a whole bunch of other stuff.
my previous cameras were a pentax k1000 and before  that a zeiss ikon contaflex.
i trust the evaluative metering with exosure compensation.
is it worth it for vertical handling?
i may end up  returning it.
the camera has never let me down yet, and has even survived being sprayed  with a super-soaker (although it didn't take too heavy a hit).
waiting for the overtime pay i'll get from work this winter...
hopefully an engineer at canon will read this and change the  useless custom function #9 into allowing the user to choose between slow and  normal sync.
but i don't really miss them as i do not use the partial meter anyway.
thanks angel hernandez , march 06, 2000; 01:01 p.m. tim, i only had focusing problems with the elan in two scenarios.
i, too, found that the lower iso films (50, 100) are underexposed, no  matter how i expose them.
but with a little  patience i got used to move the metering mode switch without looking at it.
i did feel as through  the bp-50 was overpriced.
the white ones... on this camera and then looking like  a pro :(!!! ) , my experience in using this as an advanced ameteur/student has  been overall good.
canon's previous fill flash system, a-ttl, has gotten a pretty bad rap and is  certainly inferior to the nikon 3d matrix system.
i think it's a great camera - for my little experience with such cameras.
in other modes it doesn't seem to kick in - and whatever i do with cf 7 - it doesn't change things.
the next time i had trouble, was when i was shooting in low light with a long zoom.
i help him with the design and construction of it, and i would  like to know what kind of electronic shooter the elan ii (eos 50?) has.
after reading all the hyped comments about the elan iie, i bought into  them.
after reading many many reviews of lenses, and looking at optical graphs i realized that i wanted a fixed lens.
the focus point is correctly selected and i'm not too near the subject.
the only thing i don't like about it is the silver metal.
maybe you'd like to try a 24-85, it's a  nice lens (take a look at the review).
i must say, however, that the rebel g works remarkably well (and is very light) for the ~$300 you pay for the kit.
i just got a roll back from the lab and every shot on it was  a keeper.
especially as the camera seems to use far  more batteries using the pack than normal.
after the sand incident, the camera needed a clean and the  ultrasonic motor needed replacing because we took pictures with the lens jammed  full of sand.
and i've now got a rechargeable 2cr5 system to cover for emergencies.
after a day of trucking it around disney world what will you  call it?
i am a firm believer in nikon camera, nikon flash, canon camera, canon flash.
i  compensate by setting the iso 1/3 stop low (iso 80 for an iso 100 film).
i miss the partial  metering button that was where the focus sensor select button is; the metering  mode switch under the mode control dial is sometimes awkward to operate.
shooting fantastic portraits, landscapes and overall takes of the event with e-ttl and fp flash ...
the elan ii ($420) competes in price with the nikon n50 ($410) which can't even begin to touch it in terms of features.
the elan iie can easily focus on low-contrast (flat/unpatterned) subjects b/c it has the pattern projection of the assist light.
i'am glad that i made the purchased.
i also like the elan ii very much.
derrell wilson , january 28, 2000; 04:00 p.m. i just bought a iie with the 28-105 usm from b&h last week.
canon put a manual focus mode selector on the body?
in fast action photography the  selection speed is unacceptable.
i was torn between the n70 and the elan originally -  while i found the n70 to have a more "solid" feel, and a quieter  mirror flip, i found that the interface on the elan ii (with all its dials and  stuff) required less thinking and fumbling around to use (and hence allow me to  focus on shooting).
sometimes i wish it was a little faster at the long end but overall i'm thrilled with the performance of this lens.
i had to use some paper underneath it to make contact with the poles.
this is most  noticable when shooting in low light.
every time i go out in autumn or winter my  battery indicator gets crazy.
we'll see how this one turns out...
i would also perhaps recommend the magic lantern book for the camera - as mentioned elsewhere on this site - it has good details on some of the features that the camera manual does not cover as clearly.
second, the main dial of my camera  has broken after 16 months of use.
buying it originally with a  piece of junk tokina 28-300 lens (i'm happy with my 28-105 usm now).
you know all this anyway, it's in the article.
i  was originally going to buy a new elan ii but the store got a used iie in so i  got that instead.
usm, 50/1.4 usm, 85/1.8
if canon supplied a sticker for the bottom of the  camera which allowed you to connect the numbers with a name life would be much  easier.
i haven't used camera much since, so i can not  say if camera fully functional.
they  appear in this order in the plug, from sleeve to tip.
why does the elan 7 not have as good of af as the ii?
i have noticed that my camera sometimes locks up, and the battery light  starts flashing.
pratik bhattacharya , october 26, 1999; 08:42 a.m. eos 50e is definitely an excellent body.
e. this is because the camera's ultra-quiet film  winding mechanism uses an infared system to count the spockets as the film  travels through the counter.
i couldn't stand the slow ec and disabling the ec function when i turn the camera vertically.
like the... there are few industries as heart-wrenching as the fine art business.
(besides i  have a feeling that more prints are ruined because of bad processing in  photolabs than not proper exposing.)
it happened halfway through a shoot during  one of the local festivities, the only mode that works was manual.
i never know if my batteries are full or empty.
thanks, and happy shooting.
i have a website that  displays some of the pictures i took with my rebel g, and like 2 that i took  with the 2000, but i am constantly updateing it as new pictures find thier way  onto film, and soon some actuall elan ii pictures will be showing up there, i  encourage you to visit it and let me know what you think.
it has fewer preset 'modes' for taking  special kinds of pictures (portraits/sport/macro etc..) than the n-70, but as  far as i can tell, these are only specific combinations of shutter speed and  aperture, so you would want to setthese yourself anyways.
then i saw the elan iie with its controls so similar to my older canons that i knew i would feel much more at home.
it happened halfway through a shoot during one of the local festivities, the only mode that works was manual.
and the bp50 doesn't have its own main dial and fe/focus point buttons!
every so often if i am not  careful enough, the next picture taken may carry the the unneccessary  compensation from the previous one.
extremly clear and simple, so i went with this  lens.
this is nothing against simple cameras and a simple kit, but more  capable cameras and more varied kits allow you to take shots which work in a  much wider variety of situations.
it still isn't up the the  standards set by nikon, because it is still possible to fool it without a ton  of effort, but it does work much better than a-ttl or straight ttl flash  metering.
at any rate, i've run hundreds of rolls through my elan ii, and am really pleased with it.
i still use the exposure i calculate, however; i've just never been able to trust computers.
then i tried cannons 24 to 85mm
i've read here and there about underexposure problems with the elan ii.
excellent photos depend more on the  lens and tripod, but this camera body is more than adequate as a basic building  block of a real system.
i remembered that when i was in high school and college that serious photography was fun for me and that i was good at it, but i thought that i could be happy with a point and shoot.
it replaced the somewhat heavy and clunky 28-70 i've been  using for nine years.
i use it all the time.
aaron p. , july 22, 2002; 11:23 p.m. vs the elan 7e: i owned the elan iie for two years before selling it for an eos 3 which i have had for year and a half.
it has 6 segment evaluative  metering, center-weighted metering and 9.5% partial metering -- even canon  wouldn't call it "spot" metering.
it distributes the weight of heavier lenses across the camera body.
jonathan woodruff , august 21, 2007; 11:13 p.m. thank you for your comments regarding this camera!
i took the lens back.
(i read all the comments about under-exposure)
i help him with the design and construction of it, and i would like to know what kind of electronic shooter the elan ii (eos 50?) has.
in my opinion, it is no good to use it with aa batteries.
custom functions the elan ii has a host of custom functions, but i find the following most  useful: cf02: film leader position after rewind (in or out)
this is also the case if you use it in the "creative" zones (although i use nothing but "m" mode).it will not even release the shutter when you press it down completely.
positive thinking it may help to develop  the habit of carefully viewing all the view finder information before pressing  the shutter.
todd phipps , august 24, 2000; 10:24 p.m. i just picked up a used elan iie with a new 28-135is...this is a fun rig!
if you need a flexible, general purpose 35mm camera system, the elan iie has no competition.
like the... incase ari marcopoulos camera bag review olympus om-d e-m5 announcement and preview pentax k-01 preview latest learning articles three tips for selling/showing your photos in a gallery
with nikon, you need three hands to operate the  thing.
and in aperature or shutter priority (and of course,  manual) the meter just seems to ignore the fact that the flash is there, so you  have to basically calculate the exposure by hand.
i haven't noticed it much, but until recently, i shot more print film than slide film, and i seriously doubt my skill at recognising a well-exposed negative.
* silent work by quiet whisper drive film transport system (more than eos3) *
it's gone through extreme elements, cluttered camera bags and dustly conditions without a single problem.
if you set it to leave film leader out after rewind, it only works when you reach the end of the roll and the camera starts to rewind automatically.
i will work on taking over control of the functions as my confidence  with the camera grows, especially when the limitations of the metering system  in unusual lighting situations arises thanks again for all of the info.
in addition to the usual dust, rain, vibrations and soforth the camera has been dropped, hard, a couple of times, had a heavy oak table collapse onto it and was thrown out of a car window into a sand dune before being rolled over as the vehicle rolled down the dune (had to dig to find camera).
the n70 does seem rather awkward - although i lked the grip better on it.
there is no one ideal camera and since it is not easy to recommend one above the other mention must be given to canons inovative approach to bring cutting edge technology to camera manufacture and design.
the af is really good
also, if you use the built-in flash for fill (or worse yet, your main flash), the battery runs down rather quickly.
as a matter of  fact, i am shopping for a used one for backup.
it's too bad canon won't let us have the black version that is available in europe.
multiple exposure mode turn off the friggin' beeps push this button multiple times to cycle through the various functions.
eric shen , may 04, 2000; 08:23 p.m. i just bought a canon elan iie after using a canon ft-ql for quite a while.
in answer to peoples comments about the film leader custom function i have not had a problem with it funtioning in any of the camera's modes.
tomorrow will be the third time i send it for service.
-ksk cliff lesergent , june 21, 1998; 11:40 a.m. one of the few things i dislike about the elan iie is the tacky aluminum  finish.
the 380 is great, especially for fill flash, because of the  super-synch that it has.
the  vertical grip comes in handy, and the elan iie/50e will even do eye controlled  focusing while held vertically.
it's a good buy, and i actually like the silver finish...
it has been exposed to more than it was designed for and it continues to get the job done right.
i have not had the opportunity to experence the camera at it's fullest.
i have used a really, really old pentax ex ii camera - that was the camera i learned photography on.
not even the canon sales reps know what the bodies will be or look like, rumor has it that there will be two, something similar to the n90s, and something to replace the a2.

greg martin , april 07, 2000; 09:41 p.m. i've had my elan ii for almost a year and a half now, and i've been very  pleased with it.
i have no previous experience with slr cameras (in fact i  discover this page searching for help on them) although they always fascinated  me.
i see the whisper drive system has been improved.
it still isn't up the the standards set by nikon, because it is still possible to fool it without a ton of effort, but it does work much better than a-ttl or straight ttl flash metering.
i opted for an elan ii because: 1) it was lighter and was smaller to hold (i have small hands) 2) as a beginner in all this i wanted a body that would allow me to grow with the camera for some time before having to invest in another body.
i've 2 elan iie (or 55, the japanese version), one is the orginal  black/silver and the other the all black.
if you use standard over the counter aa batteries the meter will initially read  low and after a few minutes use read full.
chris hay edwyn schuchhard , august 02, 1999; 05:50 a.m. i use my eos 50e now for 2 years and don't have many complains.
to me that's praise enough.
one other finding...when i tested the 28-80 usm iv lens, it performed  extremely well with slides under a loupe.
a laudable achievement!

heck the rebel was out of my price range, but hey when you get into photography, you either make yourself poor buying stuff or it sits in a closet somewhere collecting dust.
andrzej krytenko , november 12, 1999; 04:46
"photographers are one of the most violent groups of people, first they frame you, then they shoot you, then they hang you on a wall.
kurt maurer , december 25, 1999; 11:36 p.m. hi.
but i hate the battery  pack - to me, the handling is much worse with it fitted, and the cost of 2cr5s  is now so low that there's no saving.
i hate the new all silver cameras(elan 2,rebel 2000).
the camera is easy to use and figure out, canon's usm af technology is impressive, and the fill flash finally works pretty well for off center subjects.
i did not opt for the elan ii e since i felt the eye focus system was an  overkill for me personally.
most older cameras use a mechanical counter when the gear turns pulling the film by the sprocket holes...
i have  heard that the new elan 7 is even quieter.
at least on the rebel xs i was able to buy the eyepiece extender ep-ex15 to get some more eye relief.
when i got the slides back, the  ones taken at the camera's exposure were hopelessly overexposed, so i think  i'll still trust my own calculations in difficult light.
35mm is adequate for most uses, and the elan  iie fills the bill nicely.
anyway because i would like more  control over my indoors shots, i always use the metered manual of the camera.
the price  tag was unreal also, wow!.
flash  exposure with my 550ex is spotless.
cf2 (leaving a film leader on rewind) has a very strange internal logic: with cf2 off then, of course, you get full rewind in all shooting modes when the film finishes or when you hit the rewind button.
i have  found it's not often you get back a roll and all the pictures are pretty  descent, this body / lens combination seems to do the trick.
copyright 1996 john m. sully.
i wanted to  comment on the cf2 feature that leaves the film leader out.
if you switch to one shot or ai focus mode, depressing the shutter button does absolutely nothing!
shun cheung compares the sb-900, sb-800, sb-600, and sb-400, and offers detailed specs on the flashes.
althrough, when it has been put to the test, it has passed with flying colors.
could be quite a bummer!
but the 100mm focal length and f/2.8 maximum aperture makes it a great portrait  lens as well.
i saw jan kozak had similar problems and mailed him, it seems he ended up  giving the camera to his son :-(
after a day of trucking it around disney world what will you call it?
there  is one thing i am wondering about though - and would greatly enjoy if someone  could enlighten me: the built-in af assist beam - it only seems to  work in the 'green-zone' mode - and i really don't use that mode at all.
i have probably done things no self-conscious photo.net photographer would do - i bought the following lenses with or shortly after getting the camera: tamron 28 - 300mm 3.5/6.3f quantarray 18-35mm quantarray 50mm/
its lost features and problems almost outweigh the improvements and certainly do not justify paying twice the price.
the lens i got with the elan ii is the new canon 22-55 zoom, intended as a  normal lens for aps.
they could not find anything wrong with electronics.
i also tried the 70-200 l / 2.8, this lens takes great pictures and the  optics are fantastic but who the hell wants to lug around such a tank?
i must say, however,  that the rebel g works remarkably well (and is very light) for the ~$300 you  pay for the kit.
my reasons for the a2 were: 1) 3.5% spot metering vs. 9.5%; 2)
agnius john david miller , july 21, 1997; 08:02 p.m. i was surprised to see that you didn't like the 70-300 4.5-5.6 ef ii zoom.
when you press the function button again it picks up at the last feature you  diddled with, a nice ergonomic touch.
ai servo mode is follow focus mode, the camera will take an exposure irregardless of whether the af circuitry is happy or not.
if you don't use the built-in  flash, they last freakin' forever!
the white ones... on this camera and then looking like a pro :(!!! )
so if anyone has any ideas, email me!
the elan lets me shoot without thinking about using my equipment.
using manual mode with the elan ii is a breeze.
bad things: i also got an aa battery pack, but to my disapointment there was no exposure lock/focusing point selection buttons on it.
recently i made a photo journalism job with eos 3 plus 70-200l and 550ex (amazing combo) and eos 50e plus 20-35l and 420ex (great combo).
it's a very  light combination (i traded it for a much to havy nikon system after towing it  for 4 weeks in sri lanka jungle).
so far i have done 2 weddings and several church functions with the  elan ii and have never had a problem of any kind.
if you have any info on it please mail me, i  would like to build the same device my friend has to use it with my elan ii.
nice, but not worth $50.
batery indicator loves to tell me my aa cells are about to die.
spend your money on lenses or film instead or buy two bodies!
i am a  firm believer in nikon camera, nikon flash, canon camera, canon flash.
i found it to be very sharp, even around the edges.
i haven't used camera much since, so i can not say if camera fully functional.
i use bp 50 for better handling with big lenses like 80-200l i found it very helpful.
the elan ii had a more sensitive suite.
as best i can tell, the battery indicator is utterly meaningless.
unfortunately, it does not  have the very useful multi-function dial found on the elan ii/50 (e), which is  a shame.
i never need  to take my eye away from the viewfinder to set any of the major functions  (aperture, shutter speed, exposure compensation).
" jerry cannon , september 25, 1999; 10:11 p.m. i bought an elan ii about 6 months ago, just to try out a canon camera, i have also a n-70 and an n-90s which i like very much.
now all i would like is to foot the bill of a 17mm or the likes, as well as maybe get the standard ~50mm/1.4 lens some things i have noticed already, without seeing any pictures yet: when i use the automatic mode, it pops up the blitz to stop backlight - when i am targetting a paraglider half a mile away - the n-70 did not do this.
in shutter priority it handles shutter speed, and in aperture priority it changes the aperture.
with nikon, you need three hands to operate the thing.
it was a little faster at the long end but overall i'm thrilled with the  performance of this lens.
i still use the exposure i calculate, however; i've  just never been able to trust computers.
within two hours i understood every function, and have  not once been confused by any of it.
i do  however have a problem for which i would be most grateful for any input.
after my first few rolls of film, i was very satisfied with the prints taken with my 28 - 105 usm lens (acting on the advice of many photo.net users).
(the elan 7 has a better algorithm, but still!
first, it is true that this  function only operates in one of the creative zone modes.
rechargable ni-cad's are so much cheaper in the long run than li cells!
i know  that the vast majority of people making a living with photography do what i do,  but like the rest of you i hold out hope that i may capture some images that  are salable to publishers as well.
the 3 focusing rectangles will not light up either.
when there are weird shadows and bright spots (tricky metering), i switch it to partial mode and this yeilds pretty good results generally.
the lr6 is a photo battery with higher  output and recovery although with a shorter life span.
same physical sensor package, but the eos-1v has a slightly better algorithm).
there are two things i'd like to say about that: 1.
this is my first slr, and i found it really easy to use...
turning on  custom function 2 instructs the camera to leave the leader out on rewind, a  handy feature for those of us who shoot different types of film in different  conditions.
-and i've spent entirely too much for a lowly amateur!
it seemed to me that the n-70 was better at adjusting the focus  automatically when the distance shifted greatly - but i haven't double-checked  this yet (same lenses though).
canon seems to be into saving on costs.
the nett effect of this is that the housing is much worse for wear, flash mount is mangled and qd thing has stopped working (no loss).
the camera is a pleasure to use, and never gets in the way.
they could not find  anything wrong with electronics.
every so often if i am not careful enough, the next picture taken may carry the the unneccessary compensation from the previous one.
it also  has depth of field preview, a mirror pre-fire feature which is tied to a 2  second self timer, a very capable fill flash system and all of the other  features which are commonly found on mid range slr's.
all i can say is that camera technology sure has changed.
for the money, i would get a2 or eos-5.
mine has gotten knocked around quite a bit during multiple  trips through nepal and through the western us.
as for the cannon elan ii body, it is my first slr and i enjoy it a lot.
i have actually used this camera for portraits and weddings, and it is  exceptionally easy to use and provides commercial quality results.
in the end, that's the highest compliment you can pay to a piece of  photographic equipment.
(2) it's really nice to have the option of using aa batteries via  the bp-50 battery pack and grip.

the interface is more criptic and the  camera is heavier (n70).
while there are some features that i miss, such as the vertical grip ae lock, fp selection, and main control wheel, and some things like the metal finish that i don't particularly like(try mounting an 'l' lens...
i would love to have mf/af at the same time.
i miss the partial metering button that was where the focus sensor select button is; the metering mode switch under the mode control dial is sometimes awkward to operate.
something that i don't think has been mentioned, the dep mode is great...
i live in the sticks so i haven't tried it.
it also has depth of field preview, a mirror pre-fire feature which is tied to a 2 second self timer, a very capable fill flash system and all of the other features which are commonly found on mid range slr's.
it works very well, all of the controls are very east to find and use.
with a simple changing of the eye direction, voila: dof preview for best composition.
article created 1996 add a comment bob atkins , february 10, 1997; 06:33 p.m. just a couple of comments on a very comprehensive review.
i guess this would be fixed  with a 380 ex flash and e-ttl flash metering... but the on-camera flash is  pretty weak still.
the fact that most of the controls are knobs that you twist or turn mean that even in pitch black you can figure out what settings are set where.
hundreds of rolls of film have gone through my camera, and it has given me pictures as i envisioned them with great ease.
the main control dial  broke.
i am in the process of camera buying, and this will help me out a lot!
last year i again travelled asia, but with my eos it was no pain.
since i never use the self timer i always leave it in mirror prefire mode.
changing that rating to iso 40 fixed that.
changing the focus point is so easy and quick that eye control focus almost isn't necessary, but more on this later.
there's this burning smell emmited from the built-in flash section.
now, with my trust into canon restored, i can concentrate on taking pictures.
i had a 58/1.4, a 200mm and a 38 - 100 zoom lens.
i'm not sure if this is because of low batteries (although they are new lr6 batteries) or if it might be a problem with the camera.
save the money for the lenses.
although it is not made anymore, the 30 and 33 which replaces the 50e are very advanced for their specification.
the only 'solution' is to just carry around a spare set of batteries at all times just in case (of course, you might argue that this is good practice anyway, but it's nice to have *some* idea how much time you've got left rather than have it shut down in the middle of shooting).
i decided to try some different lenses, first i tried the tamron 28 to 300mm.
the lens that comes with the camera is pretty worthless and there doesn't seem to be any way to buy the body alone (probably this is a margin issue for either the retailer or canon).
the next-least expensive seems to be a used nikon f-90 with an mb-10.
to of my friends have in the past week bought a nikon n-60 and  a nikon n-70.
hopefully an engineer at canon will read this and change the useless custom function #9 into allowing the user to choose between slow and normal sync.
vinicius eric yuzon , march 09, 1999; 09:28 p.m. i just purchased the canon elan ii and i really love it.
i have actually used this camera for portraits and weddings, and it is exceptionally easy to use and provides commercial quality results.
unfortunately (i  think, maybe you don't), i guess your lens won't allow you to manually focus  without switching to "mf", so that you could take full advantage of  this really useful custom function.
the metering system seems to work quite well, although i initially thought  that it underexposed mainly because i shoot velvia and was rating it at iso 50.
i found this by mistake when i went to switch out a partially used film cartridge.
as a result, i need to  move my head around to see the entire frame and the displays.
ryan allen , october 18, 1999; 03:58
kevin steiger , january 29, 1999; 10:57 p.m. after being an avid canon fan for many years (ft-ql, f-1, ae-1, a1), i  decided to try nikon.
therefore, so long as you allow for this, you can use infrared film in your eos 50/e - elan ii/e." scott weaver , may 19, 2001; 02:18
while there are some features that  i miss, such as the vertical grip ae lock, fp selection, and main control  wheel, and some things like the metal finish that i don't particularly like(try  mounting an 'l' lens...
it seems to on the money every time, as long as i do my part and pay attention to what i am doing.
i'm hoping to take photos this week around  the city and start playing with all the manual settings.
i've rediscovered a very satisfying hobby  and am taking better photos than i ever have, mainly because i am now able to  afford all of the equipment i wanted but couldn't afford when i was a poor  student.
now that the elan 7 and  7e are out, there should be some good close-out deals happening on the  ii's...if you don't need the very latest thing, these are a killer camera.
sometimes they are right, sometimes they are not.
mlu prefire * evaluative  flash metering (e-ttl ) with high speed flash sync (via pulses, up to 1/4000)
if you use standard over the counter aa batteries the meter will initially read low and after a few minutes use read full.
the great thing about this configuration is that you can manually focus or use auto focus as the situation dictates without having to change the focus mode.
i just got a roll back from the lab and every shot on it was a keeper.
seems to happen more often indoors.
within two days of replacing the batteries the indicator suggests that i am below 1/3-1/4 charge.
and the weight was for me the number one choise.
you  adjust the function setting with the main dial which is located behind the  shutter release.
i use my camera often for travel (landscapes, for people i use a harmless  looking hexar) and nature photography and with great pleasure.
the dual-dial on the elon is wonderful.
one to hold the body, one to focus the lens, and one to hold the function/set buttons.
so...i put an elan iie on the hold shelf, and come wed.
thomas smith , february 26, 1998; 02:31 p.m. i like the camera, but for those that haven't found out yet, one of the custom fuctions (#2, i think) doesn't work the way you would expect.
next to the focus mode knob is the lcd display window.
in manual mode it sets the shutter speed and aperture is set with the quick control dial on the back.
i don't if it was really settled.
when i bought the eos 3 i was worried that that it did not have the built in near ir patterned focus assist.
there is more plastic used in the 2000, and the pop up flash doesnt want to  stay down.
althrough, when it has  been put to the test, it has passed with flying colors.
the price tag was unreal also, wow!.
if you need a flexible, general purpose 35mm camera system, the elan iie  has no competition.
in general i just trust the evaluative metering if i have the misfortune to find myself shooting in the middle of the day.
and i am really happy with this lens also.
i had picked up an ixus in tax-free  shopping a few months ago, which comes with a small remote (rc-5).
eos 50e does lack spot meter, interchangeable viewfinder, 21 point  evaluative metering among other things.
in the end, that's the highest compliment you can pay to a piece of photographic equipment.
none of the new york places seem to have it.
i recalled a post somewhere that suggested adding a thing piece of card board e.g., from a 3x5 card into the top of the battery compartment to assure good contact.
i would also like to mention that photo.net was what actually caused my  decision to get a new slr in the first place.
tim norford , march 06, 2000; 06:34
took it  hiking with me and it was great, lightweight and easy to use quickly.
so there we are, having said all this do you think that the latest offerings would be acceptable?
one controls exposure lock and the setting of the current custom function  when in custom function setting mode.
the fact of it having e-ttl was handy too.
however, the fogging  is limited to the bottom 15% of the frame, an it may be much less with some  films.
these features would cut into high-end sales!
but a had my  problems to, not all brand batteries fit well as said by luciano costa.
the eye control works great and is more functional than gimmicky.
i settled on the canon elan ii.
meter is right on the money, and no "experimental" or  "work in progress" features.
p.m. i purchased my elan iie exactly one year ago and for the most part, i love  it.
-- jdm luciano costa , december 27, 1997; 12:44 a.m. elan ii e. wonderfull camera.
often i check my calculated  exposure against the exposure recommended by the meter and they seldom vary by  more than 1/2 stop or so.
formerly a pro, now  semi-pro, i thought it was time to move into the '90s (1990's) and try a little  automation.
my interest was rekindled recently when i purchased a digital camera which  comes with some manual controls.
the lens i got with the elan ii is the new canon 22-55 zoom, intended as a normal lens for aps.
the main control dial controls the main feature for the exposure mode you've chosen.
i'm planning on buying a 70-200 2.8l, but that's a little pricy for me right now.
i did not go for the eye-controll version, but i might just try to go back  therre tomorrow and exchange it (it seems that you ppl exschange cameras so  easily :p)
second, when you  switch to one of the automatic modes, you'll notice that the cf indicator in  the display will disappear.
now it's as quiet as the old a2e (when its flash isn't zooming) and the original elan.
mf gets progressively more difficult as you go to slower lenses, but this is to be expected.
the pictures were pretty  good, there was of course some distortion at the wide end 24mm but all around a  useful lens for travel.
these pictures were certainly better than my p&s cameras and slighter  sharper than my 3.3 megapixel camera.
one of the really neat things about it is its ability to sync up at all shutter speeds when you use high speed sync mode.
i've played with a lot of other cameras  since, including a nikon n70, a n8008s, an eos 1n, and an eos a2e, and i have  to say that by far, the elan iie is still the easiest to use camera i've  encountered.
eye controlled focussing works like a charm for me after just one calibration cycle.
so far, i've been pleased with the camera.
and the weight was for me the number one  choise.
and i am still very happy with its performance.
it's  a six-car pileup at the intersection of art and commerce and the amount of  opinion and hyperbole that is somehow labeled as... dslrs in the movies: 'hellbent' the ten best action films of 2011 understanding dpi: the solution to resolution ready, set, go:
now i go everywhere with this  camera, and also my digital camera - which sports a zeiss lens.
also, the eos 5 command dial isn't smooth which could spoil any moment.
for example, i often use either auto bracketing or flash compensation.
in  manual mode it sets the shutter speed and aperture is set with the quick  control dial on the back.
the lcd simply fades off at times.
so is this really a problem with all elan iie's ?
my first three rolls resulted in a total of three of the best pictures  i have ever taken.
i would also perhaps recommend the magic lantern book for the camera - as  mentioned elsewhere on this site - it has good details on some of the features  that the camera manual does not cover as clearly.
also, the n-70 will  not pop up the flash in auto mode, it will indicate that it requires the flash.
the metering is fine imo.
i have not had  the opportunity to experence the camera at it's fullest.
(1) i believe my elan ii consistantly underexposes by about 1/3 stop.
i haven't done the math, but given that aa cells are quite a bit cheaper than 2cr5 batteries, the unit will probably pay for itself over time.
the elan iie has an eye controlled dof  preview feature which works around this problem.
all of the lenses, except for the 100/2.8 macro, are really quick and quiet.
i played with the shutter and aperture  controls and got to understand photography better.
thomas smith , february 26, 1998; 02:31 p.m. i like the camera, but for those that haven't found out yet, one of the  custom fuctions (#2, i think) doesn't work the way you would expect.
the vingneting on this lens was so bad, i took a picture of a plane in the sky and it was aweful, totally dark in the corners and you could see a round dark halo.
in my opinion, it is no  good to use it with aa batteries.
in addition, it adds high speed flash sync (via pulses, up to 1/4000th) and a new flash exposure system that is slightly less lame than previous canon eos models but still no match for nikon d (or a $50 p&s camera's).
this is due to the lack of surge capacity in commercial aa batteries.
i wanted to comment on the cf2 feature that leaves the film leader out.
i need some meat though, something to light up the night with.
it's  an inexpensive way to get an ultra-wide lens, which is normally quite costly.
and well it's so easy to use that a totally novice like me could learn the basics in less than an hour.
but canon's answer in the elan ii works pretty well.
however it is becoming familar with these cameras, that help you to decide which camera if any comes close to your estimation of the ideal camera.
mf gets progressively more difficult as you go to slower lenses,  but this is to be expected.
the 380 won't quite do that.
carrying a well equipped 35 system makes  that hope a possibility.
the alternative is to get an eos-5 and its  grip, which rrs will sell you a plate for.
these pictures were certainly better than my p&s cameras and slighter sharper than my 3.3 megapixel camera.
i have also noticed that the little red light that makes the selected  focus sensor square blink is "sloppy"; there's a blotch of red light  along the bottom of the viewfinder when the square blinks.
i thought it was the height of technological achievement because i could focus with the lens wide open
it replaced the somewhat heavy and clunky 28-70 i've been using for nine years.
just in front of the lcd panel lies the main control dial and the shutter release.
even thought i wear glasses, the eye controlled focus works  really well, even after only one calibration.
if you want a camera that gives you plenty of control without getting bossy, this camera is perfect.
my camera tends to underexpose in some lighting conditions, especially in low light or backlight, when using matrix metering.
the focus mode selector is located on the right side of the top panel.
i did not opt for the elan ii e since i felt the eye focus system was an overkill for me personally.
* partial metering  linked to each af sensors *
i'm happy with the metering, and the camera overall.
on the elan ii the dof preview is enabled by setting custom function 4  (cf4) to 2.
all i can say is that camera technology sure has  changed.
i can't think of any other camera in which you get so much for your money.
i have the 28-105 canon usm lens and i am pleased with it, and i have a 80-300 canon usm lens
i still think that no matter what, they make the best optics!!!
even thought i wear glasses, the eye controlled focus works really well, even after only one calibration.

using manual mode with the elan ii is a  breeze.
-ksk -- -- , december 29, 1998; 08:33
a.m. greetings, i've owned my elan ii for over three years now - and i absolutely love it.
the main control dial controls the main feature for the exposure mode  you've chosen.
the first is  if i had the camera inai servo af mode instead of one-shot af.
the 380 is great, especially for fill flash, because of the super-synch that it has.
photography in general
i was never limited by it because i was "to good" for the camera.
i just feel as though the camera is allowing me to  concentrate on composing more then on the mechanics of focusing and setting the  exposure.
this uses a white preflash from the flash, combined with the evaluative metering system to balance the background and subject exposure.
maybe if enough people ask for it, they might reconsider... ted marcus , june 29, 1998; 11:24 p.m. i just got an elan ii, after my trusty eos 650 gave up the ghost after nine  years.
canon simply cut the cost by eliminating the patterned near ir af light and giving the flash another duty.
it's an inexpensive way to get an ultra-wide lens, which is normally quite costly.
the viewfinder displays an adequate amount of  information: shutter speed/aperture flash sync speed mode (normal/high) scaled manual meter (no stupid +- arrows) range of exposures if aeb is turned on.
the only way around it i found was to cover the lens and take blank pictures (in manual mode) till you reach the end of the roll.
one of my friends with a nikon had the same problem with the same type and roll-batch of film (fuji sensia ii 100), so i ignored it and considered it a problem with the emusion.
i would strongly recomment this camera to any serious amateur like myself who wants to learn, explore and enjoy photography.
i guess that's my two cents on why i like my elan.
other important functions  such as flash compensation and exposure bracketing are easily set.
my only recommendation for anybody looking to buy a canera is try  whatever they are looking for out - hold it, shoot with it - and (excuse the  lame qualitative term) see what "feels" right for you.
it is my first really serious camera and i settled on it after lots of research.
eye control works  perfectly for me.
all the other types of film i've  used have been exposed quite well.
of course, some models will have more this or faster that, but do you really need 1/12,000 sec.
(besides i have a feeling that more prints are ruined because of bad processing in photolabs than not proper exposing.)
so how does it work?
the  price isn't so high in the us, but it is apparently costly and sometimes hard  to find elsewhere in the world.
aside from that, i have no complaints... great camera, love  it lots!
sure i had researched the elan ii (e) and would have loved to buy it, but alas,  it was well out of my price range.
i got the 50/1.8 and the 28-105/3.5-4.5 usm with it and so far i4m one happy camper.
things that i really miss are faster frame advance and exposure in 1/3  stops.
i  find the manual is a bit of a joke the way they describe the metering modes.
the "no  battery" symbol blinks everytime i expose the first frame, indicating that  something's wrong (according to the manual).
i really love that i can set the aperture using the dial on the back pane, as it is a real messs to reach on the n-70 - and the elon ii is cheaper ($ 414).
not when put to l. had to take the batteries  out and "reboot" it.
canon generally says that the is allows you to hand hold shots at up to 2 stops slower than you normally would, and you can.
tammi tran , january 23, 2001; 11:40 a.m. i have used this camera during the past 8 months and i absolutely love it.
it is a three position knob which selects one shot focus, ai focus or ai servo focus modes.
both the elans are fantastic.
things that i really miss are faster frame advance and exposure in 1/3 stops.
i'm so used to the elan ii that i actually returned the eos 5 in exchange for the all black elan 55.
" jerry cannon , september 25, 1999; 10:11 p.m. i bought an elan ii about 6 months ago, just to try out a canon camera, i  have also a n-70 and an n-90s which i like very much.
i've been looking all over the internet to find an answer but it looks like i'm the only one that's bothered by this.
this  is really great if you like to shoot with a wideangle and use hyperfocal  distances, just set the lens to the hyperfocal distance and shoot away.
therefore, so long as you allow for this, you can use infrared film in  your eos 50/e - elan ii/e." scott weaver , may 19, 2001; 02:18
maury weil , january 06, 1999; 04:00 p.m. i recently had an auto focus problem with the elan iie.
this dial  is a piece of genius.
best test of  experiences ever.
i've stayed with the 28-80 that came with the camera, but recently i've  expanded to a 75-300.
i use my camera often for travel (landscapes, for people i use a harmless looking hexar) and nature photography and with great pleasure.
both of these lenses represent very good value for your optical dollar,  sure they could be faster, but then they would cost $1500 each instead of $325  and $450, so don't complain.
i haven't noticed it  much, but until recently, i shot more print film than slide film, and i  seriously doubt my skill at recognising a well-exposed negative.
it's a camera whose capabilities one can grow into, and which is unlikely to ever be limiting for most users.
if you press the  rewind button halfway through a roll, you're stuck with no leader.
this is nothing against simple cameras and a simple kit, but more capable cameras and more varied kits allow you to take shots which work in a much wider variety of situations.
all in  all i just don't see how you can go wrong with the elanii, and 380 ex. inge stubdal , september 27, 1999; 02:19 a.m. i just bought a canon eos elan ii yesterday, at the bon marchi in bellevue,  wa.
at least on the  rebel xs i was able to buy the eyepiece extender ep-ex15 to get some more eye  relief.
on many occasions i  have gotten a shot i might otherwise have missed because all essential controls  (especially focus-point selection, ae lock, exposure compensation, and flash  exposure lock with the ex series flashes) could be operated instantly with one  hand without taking my eyes off the viewfinder.
other important functions such as flash compensation and exposure bracketing are easily set.
i'm still getting used to the different "feel" of the elan ii.
i've also bought a couple of filters (a1 instead of a uv - don't know if that was good or bad, as it warms tones just a little bit) and a circular polarizer.
i'm a blessed man again :-)) fui... (in portuguese) joel alves from rio de janeiro, brazil chris taylor , january 06, 2002; 05:12
the lr6 is a photo battery with higher output and recovery although with a shorter life span.
seeing as how i was a elan owner in the past i feel as through canon has developed an excelent product.
not even the canon sales reps know what the bodies will be  or look like, rumor has it that there will be two, something similar to the  n90s, and something to replace the a2.
i picked it up for £240 ($400) second hand - it's the qd version,  and got a 12 month warranty as well - a fair price.
karl katzke , june 14, 1998; 10:30 p.m. i beleive that the elan ii is a keeper.
therefore, without a tripod you must use either program mode or portrait mode  to take shots indoors(which
the only  thing i don't like is the custom function stuff.
this "upgrade" release is as disappointing to me as the release of the eos 1v vs the 3 (i suppose the 1v whups the 1n).
as enticing as the 1v brochure is i can't justify the added cost of this 'pro' body over the elan 2e. frame speed of the 1v would be the only benefit that i see.
there's  this burning smell emmited from the built-in flash section.
ergnomics with this slr  is fantastic and i find it easier to use than my eos 10.
it's the same with the eos-3 and the eos-1v.
the ef 100-300/4.5-5.6 usm which replaced it is reasonably sharp and has produced several slides which i have enlarged to 8x12 with good results.
i've take a look at the "official" one and it seems quite simple although the minijack has three bornes which puzzles me.
if you want a camera that gives you plenty of control without getting  bossy, this camera is perfect.
also, i just shoot for fun!
you are disorganised and end up running out of batteries somewhere where the  only thing available is aa zinc-carbon.
my reasons for  the a2 were: 1) 3.5% spot metering vs. 9.5%; 2)
in these circumstances i would never consider a 3rd party lens.
but i would  like to put 2 complaints about it.
only minor gripes about the elan iie
they work togheter with a wireless e-ttl: simply a dream...
anyway, it's a great  camera!
as enticing as  the 1v brochure is i can't justify the added cost of this 'pro' body over the  elan 2e. frame speed of the 1v would be the only benefit that i see.
this equipment has been subject to  all environments and hasn't let me down once.
i was torn between the n70 and the elan originally - while i found the n70 to have a more "solid" feel, and a quieter mirror flip, i found that the interface on the elan ii (with all its dials and stuff) required less thinking and fumbling around to use (and hence allow me to focus on shooting).
is it weatherproofed?
overall the 380ex/e-ttl system provides a substantial improvement in the  quality of fill flash provided by the canon system.
andrei lau , june 12, 1999; 10:31 p.m. i think the elan 2e is well worth the money though there is always room for improvement.
the address is: http//:www.autocannon.homepage.com thanks, and happy shooting.
i contemplated the following models and came up with the elan ii.
batery indicator loves to  tell me my aa cells are about to die.
this is a great camera for the money.
may this be a camera i dont outgrow for many years to come.
flash exposure with my 550ex is spotless.
i have "heard" that a free repair is available from authorized repair centers.
i know it doesn't have usm, but so  what.
if  canon makes the lens i'm looking for, and if i can afford it, i'll buy it.
overall the executive summary on this camera is: in this price range it can't be  beat.
i have a eos 3 and 20-35 f/2.8l afd, 28-70 and 70-200 f/2.8l usm with speedlite 550ex and 420ex.
this elan is extremely quiet.
after only a few calibrations, it's working like a charm.
is there going to be a replacement for the a2  any time soon?
i also tried the 70-200 l / 2.8, this lens takes great pictures and the optics are fantastic but who the hell wants to lug around such a tank?
i note however, that the  situation here is considerably better than it is on the pentax 67 i've been  using recently.
my guess is because nikon has a patent on using focus distance information to calculate flash exposure.
nothing extreme, but plenty of desert heat and sand, jungle humidity, freezing weather and the occasional drizzle.
if you want to get a rrs qr plate for an elan iie  equipped with the bp-50, rrs won't sell you one, because they claim that  "it's just not stable."
dennis m> guten , february 27, 1997; 04:17 p.m. i have to agree with bob that the problem of the cutom functions is easily  solved by putting all the custom functions on computer and printing out at  about a font size of 5.
thanks to everyone for their input!
seeing as how i was a elan owner in the past i feel as through canon  has developed an excelent product.
that's never happened for me before, i won't say i owe it all to the  canon elan ii, but the camera helped me immensely because it didn't stand in my  way.
other than that, the viewfinder is nice.
with a 5-point font and essentially no line spacing one can fit 10 lines of readable text into the empty space on the left hand side of the bottom of the body (if you have the camera, you will find the space easily).
now i go everywhere with this camera, and also my digital camera - which sports a zeiss lens.
i did this and laminated it to the insides of all my  lens caps so i always have this info available.
the bp50 accepts either a 2cr5 battery, or four aa cells.
there is no af-assist light?
if they am going to spend more money over the elan ii, they should probably buy an eos3.
one shot is focus priority, the camera will not fire off a shot until the af circuitry is satisfied.
the really outstanding feature of these lenses is the full time manual  focusing.
the elan ii af works from ev18 all the way down to ev0 instead of the elan 7 and rebel 2000 which do from 18 only down to 1.
one walkthrough with the manual and i was ready to go - the camera is logical and intuitive in its layout.
* very good handling with bp-50 *
some pictures are underexposed but it's not difficult to correct that.
it's a good buy, and  i actually like the silver finish...
finally, there are two buttons on the back of the camera right behind the lcd.
formerly a pro, now semi-pro, i thought it was time to move into the '90s (1990's) and try a little automation.
so i got that instead.
this camera has everything a photographer needs.......
paul gittins , july 31, 2000; 05:22 a.m. excellent reviews all round - i am glad now that i took the plunge this  weekend and picked up this fine camera.
with that camera i can't even see the whole viewfinder with my glasses off!
first  of all, its layout and handling is exemplary, perhaps one of the best of any  camera ever.
the elon ii will pop up the flash whenever it deems flashing appropriate (you can close it again, and it won't use it - but the pop-up engine makes a little noise.
when i want to reenable it, i just push the button once again.
i did do the right thing, and spent my money on glass first (20/2.8 usm, 28/1.8
yup on a elan iie not a2e.
if i wanted a camera i had to manual focus with, i woul have bought a manual focus body, and not an autofocus.
this lens is so sharp, so contrasty and it's color rendition so brilliant  that it is worth every penny of the $600 i spent on it.
i'm  also finding that i use the "one-shot" af mode, since the usual trick  of focusing and recomposing makes the ai focus mode think the subject moved and  changes the focus; again, this problem may be a holdover from the 650 that will  go away once i get used to selecting the right and left focus sensors.
i haven't done the math, but given that aa cells are quite a bit cheaper  than 2cr5 batteries, the unit will probably pay for itself over time.
i just wish it had more focussing points, and more weatherproofing (so that rain needn't stop play).
the all black elan ii has been around shortly after the initial elan ii launch.
however, i have found situations where a subject was  underexposed because of objects in the foreground which i was using to frame  the main subject (it wouldn't have worked anyway...).
i don't if it was  really settled.
it is just not reliable, especially in stressfull reportage work.
the same week i ran into a dealer selling a mint 100-300 usm canon 4.5-5.6 for $160 ( with a canon skylight filter included) at the spring photographic show at waltham high school.
turning on custom function 2 instructs the camera to leave the leader out on rewind, a handy feature for those of us who shoot different types of film in different conditions.
cf04: af activation method (af on shutter, af on ae lock, dof preview on  ae lock) cf05: self timer operation (10 sec timer or 2 sec mirror prefire) cf09: flash sync in av mode (normal av operation or force sync to 1/125)
it is just  not reliable, especially in stressfull reportage work.
it's going to strobe the flash instead like a lowly rebel?
dave cooper , may 22, 2000; 05:08 p.m. eric, to get the dof preview to work, i think you must set the camera to "one shot" mode.
over the 2 monthes i have owned it, i have lost all ability to autofocus.
vinicius matangrano , january 30, 2000; 06:07 p.m. to john gallardo (and other elan ii recent users): please refer to  http://www.advanix.com/~photo/bobatkins/info/faq30/flashfaq.htm.
e. this is because the camera's ultra-quiet film winding mechanism uses an infared system to count the spockets as the film travels through the counter.
maybe if enough people ask for it, they might reconsider... ted marcus , june 29, 1998; 11:24 p.m. i just got an elan ii, after my trusty eos 650 gave up the ghost after nine years.
i've used it mostly in texas, in very dusty conditions, and i've never had any problems with it functioning properly.
off center  subjects are handled well with results which are identical to those gained for  centered subjects.
does anyone have a way to beat this drawback?
this leaves af start on the shutter and moves dof preview to the ae lock button.
only highly specialized professional  work requires this, and only rarely at that.
i wish its  mirror slap and film advance were as quiet as the a2.
i'm  considering getting another body, in addition to this one, partly because it's  nice to have two different films loaded and available, and partly because i'd  like a backup.
if i can live with these two, i probably will never buy a better body.
this uses a white preflash from the flash, combined with the  evaluative metering system to balance the background and subject exposure.
i've stayed with the 28-80 that came with the camera, but recently i've expanded to a 75-300.
other than this malfunction, i like everybit of my eos.
having accessed many autofocus and manual focus cameras and the way that they are used i have no hesitation in saying that the eos 50e comes darn well close in terms of its features and value for money.
but the problem here is that you can't have both af start on the ae lock button and dof preview on the ae lock button at the same time.
the metering system seems to work quite well, although i initially thought that it underexposed mainly because i shoot velvia and was rating it at iso 50.
the nikon f70 on the other hand does allow the user to select between slow sync and normal sync but i believe that's the only advantage that camera has over the elanii.
best test of experiences ever.
radio slaves often seem like an esoteric accessory for pros in the studio or at sporting events, but the introduction of ttl-compatible slaves at consumer prices changes all that.
it's a very light combination (i traded it for a much to havy nikon system after towing it for 4 weeks in sri lanka jungle).
all in all i have been pleasantly surprised.
it was also an odd experiencing using an old film camera; the big problem is scanning the resulting images.
also, unlike the older eos 100 i used to own, the handgrip wasn't gummy and sticky.
nothing extreme, but plenty of  desert heat and sand, jungle humidity, freezing weather and the occasional  drizzle.
i'm thinking of either the a2 (but would rather wait for the  update to the a2, if there is one), or the eos-3.
my first slr cmera was a canon 5000 which i purchased many years ago.
dollar for dollar, you just can't get more!
now all i would like is to foot the bill of a 17mm or the likes, as well  as maybe get the standard ~50mm/1.4 lens some things i have noticed already, without seeing any pictures yet: when i use the automatic mode, it pops up the blitz to stop backlight -  when i am targetting a paraglider half a mile away - the n-70 did not do this.
the built in flash has even fired a few times when still closed!
macro 2.8f it has been a fun re-introduction to photography for me.
therefore, without a tripod you must use either program mode or portrait mode to take shots indoors(which i take many of).
not only will the flash consume more battery, it will also be much more disturbing to subjects... especially at night, not to mention it will screw up your night vision.
i leave the  leader out all the time, and have used it with mid-roll rewind with no problem.
the address is:  http//:www.autocannon.homepage.com
i also have the ef 100/2.8 macro, which doesn't have a usm focusing motor.
i found it is a good camera overall
i do not see or hear the aperture stopping down when i do this, and i also don't see the little rectangle in the top left corner light up red.
* silent work by quiet whisper drive film transport system  (more than eos3) *
it looks like canon has moved the metering mode selection to a button.
as for the leader-out debate, i read somewhere that you must be in one of  the creative zone settings for mid-roll rewind to leave the leader out.
now i put my lithium  battery into bp 50 (you can switch an inside adaptor to make it), and have good  handling and sure power!
second, when you switch to one of the automatic modes, you'll notice that the cf indicator in the display will disappear.
i haven't had any issues with its plastics being not  durable enough for me - for the stuff i did, and the abuse i gave it - it works  fine.
i just bought a canon eos elan ii yesterday, at the bon marchi in bellevue, wa.
derek johnson , october 07, 2000; 11:16 a.m. i purchased an elan ii about two years ago now.
hope this helps people who just bought or is buying into this body.
then i saw the elan iie with its controls so similar to my older canons  that i knew i would feel much more at home.
* only 3  af sensors but work better than eos a2e *
while canon has omitted a list of the custom functions from the body, one can be easily created with a word processor and laser printer.
in the pic modes only evaluative metering is used, except for close up mode which uses partial metering.
bad things: i also got an aa battery pack, but to my disapointment there was no  exposure lock/focusing point selection buttons on it.
the ef 100-300/4.5-5.6 usm which replaced it is  reasonably sharp and has produced several slides which i have enlarged to 8x12  with good results.
i may end up returning it.
i went back to my old canon 5000 and realised that the camera was very limited in its functions.
and  it had a built in lightmeter.
all the advance features are there - other  than spot metering and maybe 7 point focusing.
v. labolle , february 15, 1998; 08:39 p.m. i have experienced the battery problem i.e., when changing from one brand  of battery to another, the camera would not work.
from what i have read on this board, and heard from my  co-workers (i work at wolf camera)
karl katzke , august 24, 1998;
dave cooper , may 22, 2000; 05:08 p.m. eric, to get the dof preview to work, i think you must set the camera to  "one shot" mode.
i find both lenses i'm using (canon ef 28-105 and ef 50mm mk i) regularly  have af problems.
eye control works perfectly for me.
i'm planning on buying a 70-200 2.8l, but that's a little pricy  for me right now.
(instead of waiting for the eos 30)over its nikon equivalent (budget being an  important critera).
really it is a wonder that you can decode all of this, but you can.
the bp-300 external grip has one extra button over the bp-50 woohoo?
i couldn't  stand the slow ec and disabling the ec function when i turn the camera  vertically.
i did not get the standard lens that comes with it, but instead i got the new tamaron 28 - 300 f3.5/6.3 lens.
i have noticed that my camera sometimes locks up, and the battery light starts flashing.
it should  be sufficient.
i think anyone who down grades the elan ii in the proper exposure department either don't want to take the time to learn how the e-ttl system works or wants only a point and shoot.
am i expecting too much ?
(like every other company has done for how long now?)
the camera was claimed to be a "demo" unit that was bought direct from canon, because it came in the box, had the strap, manual, and battery.
i often mf with my 100/2.8 macro  and the scene snaps in and out of focus sharply and quickly allowing for easy  mf operation.
this feature, when combined with custom function 4, allows you to choose manual or auto focus as the shooting situation dictates without having to switch the lens or the body from auto focus to manual focus and back.
i have heard that the new elan 7 is even quieter.
the eye controlled focus does work, although not so well with glasses on which is why i tend to wear contact lenses when i go out shooting, you also need a good usm lens.
a first class camera to enter the canon system.
i friend has an old one he used to take photos of night sky with long exposures and a hand-made equatorial mount with electronic motor controlled with a computer.
i probably would have been  much happier with it.
i bought it knowing that i would not outgrow it quickly like i would with a lower end body.
this leaves af start on the shutter and moves dof preview to the ae  lock button.
third, it's very versatile.
hands down the canon can't be beat in it's midprice range.
the bp50 battery pack here's a note from javier henderson ...
since the 380ex is fully automatic you can't really use it to do fancy manual flash tricks, but if you only want fill and don't want to use it for macro work, etc.
with the camera doing exactly what i expect it  to do, all i have to do is concentrate on composing pictures!!
flashes read about nikon's current offering of flashes and accessories on  photo.net.
i just leave it enabled all the time.
probably the eye-controlled focus point selection on the iie works better than on the eos-5/a2e, a body introduced in 1992 -- philip greenspun (editor)
save  the money for the lenses.
i tried recalibrating it, but it did not seem to correct it.
i will work on taking over control of the functions as my confidence with the camera grows, especially when the limitations of the metering system in unusual lighting situations arises thanks again for all of the info.
pentax autofocus technology has not been as advanced as canons, neither has minolta.
aditionally, it has a vertical grip, with a shutter release button that duplicates the functions of the camera built-in release button.
i've been toying  around with getting the bp-50 (the vertical grip thing) for a while, but i set  cf04 for autofocus on the ae lock button, and i think the only button the grip  gives me is the shutter release.
thanks to all those who have fed back advice and comments on this camera,  you have steered an enthusiastic amateur to spend even more money...
i use bp 50 for better handling with big  lenses like 80-200l i found it very helpful.
plus you have to look at the box in the corner during the first few seconds after focusing.
first, it is true that this function only operates in one of the creative zone modes.
and when the results came back from the lab, it was aok :)
the elan ii af works from ev20 all the way down to ev0 instead of the elan 7 and rebel 2000 which only work down to ev1.it is the same with the metering system.
canon admits that it does exist, but can't tell me where i can get one w/  out traveling to france.
it should be sufficient.
but i hate the battery pack - to me, the handling is much worse with it fitted, and the cost of 2cr5s is now so low that there's no saving.
anyway i've finished talking now, my final comment is that if you already have an eos 50e, be proud of it, if you don't, go and buy the eos 30.
ai focus is a hybrid mode which normally operates as focus priority, but if the computer decides that the subject has begun to move it switches to follow focus mode.
i had picked up an ixus in tax-free shopping a few months ago, which comes with a small remote (rc-5).
i find both lenses i'm using (canon ef 28-105 and ef 50mm mk i) regularly have af problems.
-aaron parmet james robert mcculloch , august 20, 2003; 09:57 a.m. i have through many years used all sorts of cameras and owned offerings from the usual big four.
i really like being able to move the af to the back button, that's a truly nice feature.
if you own a canon and  you take macro photographs, buy this lens, not only is it a great macro lens,
now, with my trust into  canon restored, i can concentrate on taking pictures.
normally i prefer to leave cf4 set 1 which puts af start on the ae  lock button and moves ae lock to the shutter release.
one thing i wanted to add is that i think the camera balance is better with the bp-50 battery pack added than without.
when i am out, it shows no power, when i get indoors it is full.
well - the flash system is pretty lame - with my sunpak pz4000 setup or with my 220ex (a pretty useless flash) i've seen exposures come out much worse than an n70 and its built in flash.
there is one thing i am wondering about though - and would greatly enjoy if someone could enlighten me: the built-in af assist beam - it only seems to work in the 'green-zone' mode - and i really don't use that mode at all.
does anybody know what i'm doing wrong?
it is a perfect tool for composing a shot.
it's not crippling, but if i were given the choice again, i'd get the iie because of eye controlled dof preview.
john gallardo , december 28, 1999; 04:02 a.m. i just recieved an elan ii for christmas.
the following is a quote from the eos 50/elan ii user guide by hove foto book series isbn 1 87403 159 2 (page 32) "your camera instruction book states that infared film cannot be used in the eos 50/e elan ii/
just love those quasi-analog dials!
i haven't had any issues with its plastics being not durable enough for me - for the stuff i did, and the abuse i gave it - it works fine.
does anybody know of this?
the weight of the camera is nicely  balanced, giving you a solid feel.
the elan 7 has the same sensor suite as the rebel 2000 so that canon can save money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
i made my decision mostly based by information i found here.
canon admits that it does exist, but can't tell me where i can get one w/ out traveling to france.
underneath  this switch is the film advance mode switch which chooses either single shot or  continuous.
for example, i might want to focus to the left, but the system favors the right box.
it's a great camera to grow with.
in this respect with canons camera technology becoming more sophisticated and with features that people want, it is easy to understand why the canon eos 50e is the ideal camera.
the multiple frame forward is slower than on the n-70, but it will still  eat your film pretty quickly.
the all black elan2 looks ten times better than the silver one we are all used  to.
there is a custom function (#9 i think) though which allows the user to set the shutter speed at 125 in av mode.
those are my two bits allan tan , november 02, 2000; 10:24 a.m.
sanjeevan bala , may 02, 2000; 04:07 p.m. i am a complete beginner and have just purchased my first slr after years of the point and shoot.
once i'm through using the function pressing the button once and the turning the special function off is easy.
one shot is focus priority, the camera will not fire off a shot  until the af circuitry is satisfied.
the elan ii is a pretty fully featured camera.
i recalled a post somewhere  that suggested adding a thing piece of card board e.g., from a 3x5 card into  the top of the battery compartment to assure good contact.
andy grafton nick roberts , december 29, 2000; 12:22 a.m. i use this camera along with several other eos models - 5,10,100,600.
the elan ii is the first modern, auto-everything snazzy slr with which i've had a lot of experience.
it is worlds easier to turn a knob or flip a switch to a known position.
two stores in the seattle area said two completely different things - one recommended the n-70, and nikon over canon all the way, while the other store elevated canon.
george j.q.zhang , may 06, 2000; 07:16 a.m.
nothing to remember, no switches to  switch.
i recently got the 200/2.8l ii, and the 1.4x and 2x extenders, and this thing seems to overpower the body (i'm almost afraid of breaking the body when i put the 200/2.8l on it).
supposedly, it's supposed to be called  the a3, but that's just rumor right now.
with cf2 on and in a manual-setting mode (i.e. fully manual or any priority setting) you get leader rewind both when you finish the film and when you hit rewind.
i really love that i can set the  aperture using the dial on the back pane, as it is a real messs to reach on the  n-70 - and the elon ii is cheaper ($ 414).
i also read mixed reviews on how effective this  feature really is.
for the money, i would  get a2 or eos-5.
and well it's  so easy to use that a totally novice like me could learn the basics in less  than an hour.
on the top left of the camera you will find the command dial which selects one of several different operating modes, ranging from the phd pic modes -- the "image zone" in canonese -- to the "creative zone" modes: shiftable program, shutter priority, aperture priority, manual and depth of field mode.
carrying a well equipped 35 system makes that hope a possibility.
the first is if i had the camera inai servo af mode instead of one-shot af.
unless your a professional i wouldn't recommend it, just because it's too heavy.
and i am still very happy  with its performance.
but i don't really miss them as i do  not use the partial meter anyway.
while the elan7e will certainly appears to beat the n80 hands down (imho, the elaniie also beat the tar out of the n80), i see little reason for anyone to upgrade to the elan7e from an elan iie.
i tried it in stores, and even after calibrating, it still seemed gimmicky and more like a toy than a tool for me.
there is more plastic used in the 2000, and the pop up flash doesnt want to stay down.
dave samir koirala , july 23, 2000; 03:56 p.m. after gleaning a lot of useful information from photo.net over the years, i decided to put in my two cents here.
the classic complaint from eyeglass wearers about canon cameras still  applies to the elan ii: there isn't enough eye relief.
35mm is adequate for most uses, and the elan iie fills the bill nicely.
but if i wanted to do that i could just go manual and set it to that speed much  faster than going through the custom function list.
on the other hand, the bp-1e for the eos 1n/3/1v is only a dual power source aa battery pack with no.
what i hadn't counted on was the eye controlled depth of field preview.
i noticed that in programmed mode it almost  always just went to the largest aperature and gave it a 1/60th shutter speed,  even with the lens off.
next thing you know they will be putting aperture rings on their lenses (that will be the day).
this is one great camera, it fits like a glove in my hands, and all of the controls are within my reach.
i  opted for an elan ii because: 1) it was lighter and was smaller to hold (i have small hands) 2) as a  beginner in all this i wanted a body that would allow me to grow with the  camera for some time before having to invest in another body.
joel alves , september 21, 2001; 07:37 p.m. canon eos 50e pro: * eye dof preview (great tool when well used) *
this camera with the 28-105 lens is a  perfect combination.
i got the 50/1.8  and the 28-105/3.5-4.5 usm with it and so far i4m one happy camper.
in shutter priority it  handles shutter speed, and in aperture priority it changes the aperture.
anyway because i would like more control over my indoors shots, i always use the metered manual of the camera.
one thing i wanted to add is that i think the camera balance is better  with the bp-50 battery pack added than without.
the only way  around it i found was to cover the lens and take blank pictures (in manual  mode) till you reach the end of the roll.
dennis m> guten , february 27, 1997; 04:17 p.m. i have to agree with bob that the problem of the cutom functions is easily solved by putting all the custom functions on computer and printing out at about a font size of 5.
i do however have a problem for which i would be most grateful for any input.
build-wise it feels a bit plastic and lightweight
i think anyone who  down grades the elan ii in the proper exposure department either don't want to  take the time to learn how the e-ttl system works or wants only a point and  shoot.
only partial... comments: i do love this camera!!
after reading many many reviews of lenses, and looking at optical graphs i  realized that i wanted a fixed lens.
about the servo af, i suggest that you set cf4 to 1, to link af to the back button.
the interface is more criptic and the camera is heavier (n70).
took it hiking with me and it was great, lightweight and easy to use quickly.
canon hasn't improved the af really we wouldn't want to match the eos 3/1v because that would cut into the sales of the high-end cameras.
i've used it mostly in texas, in very dusty conditions, and  i've never had any problems with it functioning properly.
the viewfinder displays an adequate amount of information: the elan ii has a host of custom functions, but i find the following most useful: as for most people, i find cf4 is the most useful and used custom function, i typically leave it set to 1 (af on ae lock button), but like anything else this depends on the shooting situation i am faced with.
you have to lug around the huge, heavy, and expensive pb-e2 motor drive for full controls.
i was never able to get what i would call an elargeable slide out of it.
this dial falls naturally under your thumb and makes adjusting exposure compensation or aperture a snap.
combine this with a very  easy to use interface and you are looking at a real winner in the mid price  range.
very easy and intuitive.
i have the 28-105 canon usm lens and i am pleased with it, and i have a  80-300 canon usm lens
underneath this function button is the mid-roll rewind button.
i compensate by setting the iso 1/3 stop low (iso 80 for an iso 100 film).
usm have been stunning.
it can be easy to  do if you leave a lens shade attached.
the one thing that i don't like so much about it, is the flash metering.
i'm also finding that i use the "one-shot" af mode, since the usual trick of focusing and recomposing makes the ai focus mode think the subject moved and changes the focus; again, this problem may be a holdover from the 650 that will go away once i get used to selecting the right and left focus sensors.
first, some brands  of batteries dont work with the camera !!!
fun in medium format  becomes tiresome and expensive.
this is good, thoughtful  ergonomic design and helps to make the camera easy to use.
p.s.i didn't really comment on the camera cuz it looks like you all know how great it is already.
the eye-control focus is a fun toy to wow friends and family, but i hardly ever use it.
if you are uk based, then i can't recommend mxv highly enough - http://www.mxv.co.uk/ - they are professional, friendly and very, very helpful, if something is a lemon, they will tell you - and if don't live in sussex (myself included) then they will ship it out to you for about £7 on approval...
the autofocus is fast and crisp no matter what.
could be quite a  bummer!
good things: the camera is light and controls are logically laid out, which makes  camera a joy to use.
it gets every last drop of performance out of the eye controlled focus, the image stabilisation works as well if not better than canon says it does and the optics are a dream for a zoom lens at its price.
dave samir koirala , july 23, 2000; 03:56 p.m. after gleaning a lot of useful information from photo.net over the years, i  decided to put in my two cents here.
and i'm not sure how happy i would have been paying £500 for it in 1996 (albeit that at the age of 20 i didn't have £500).
to of my friends have in the past week bought a nikon n-60 and a nikon n-70.
jon reades , september 14, 2004; 10:33 a.m. i have had the elanii for about three years now and am very happy with the performance of the system and the quality of the photos -- i feel very much the (fake) photojournalist wandering around with the 35mm lens attached.
a laudable  achievement!
the elan iie is no doubt the best camera in the world for its price and features.
taking photos with eos 50e is pleasure.
this probably means that none of the cf modes will  work when the camera is in one of the auto modes.
all in all i just don't see how you can go wrong with the elanii, and 380 ex. inge stubdal , september 27, 1999; 02:19 a.m.
i know it doesn't have usm, but so what.
may this  be a camera i dont outgrow for many years to come.
all the advance features are there - other than spot metering and maybe 7 point focusing.
anyone reading this who already has an eos 50e or an elan iie as they are known in the u.s., if you don't already have it you should get the canon 28-135 usm is lens for use as a standard zoom lens.
i then decided to purchase another slr and after doing extensive homework in the internet, i decided to purchase a canon eos 50e (instead of waiting for the eos 30)over its nikon equivalent (budget being an important critera).
after the sand incident, the camera needed a clean and the ultrasonic motor needed replacing because we took pictures with the lens jammed full of sand.
i have the elan  iie and love it.
i guess that's my two cents on why i like my  elan.
it displays shutter speed and aperture, frame number, battery status, exposure compensation (or manual meter reading) whether or not flash compensation is set, red eye reduction setting status, whether or not you have custom function active, mf/af active status and a whole bunch of other stuff.
the elan7e is 15% faster at ecf than an eos3?
1/200 sync speed vs 1/125; 3) 5  focusing points vs. 3 4) much much quieter film advance 5)more useful vertical  grip.
i'm glad that i no longer need to look at  something and say: "i could have a great picture here if i only had a  macro lens".
but i am not satisfied on the quality, hard the focus  realy sharp, not realy that sharp pics.
the problem could be corrected by shooting without the lenshood or by attaching the 380 ex flash and setting the center focusing point manually.
with cf2 on and in a creative zone you get full rewind if you hit the rewind button *but* you get leader if you finish the film.
also, a diamond af pattern like the minolta 7 has would be a bit more useful than the crosshair pattern used by the elan 7.
is  this widespread, or just a problem with a few bodies?
i did feel as through the bp-50 was overpriced.
i noticed that in programmed mode it almost always just went to the largest aperature and gave it a 1/60th shutter speed, even with the lens off.
some diehard nikon fans call that an advantage (a  heavier camera).
based on the dates of the posts i assume that film passed from our world to the next sometime in 2003.
aditionally, it  has a vertical grip, with a shutter release button that duplicates the  functions of the camera built-in release button.
metering patern and af pattern and sensitivities are precisely the same for the elan 7 and the rebel 2000 because they use the same chips!!!!
on that note, i see there is still no spot meter on this "upgrade."
i'm not sure if this is because of low batteries (although  they are new lr6 batteries) or if it might be a problem with the camera.
the 50e show me how it is a fantastic tool for the price.
when you have the lens in af mode and the camera in ai servo mode, when you depress the shutter button half-way to focus, it just wanders between the 2 focusing extremes.
but too bad  is wasn't built though.
it's not crippling, but if i  were given the choice again, i'd get the iie because of eye controlled dof  preview.
i then decided to purchase another slr and after  doing extensive homework in the internet, i decided to purchase a canon eos 50e
desmond robinson , march 06, 2000; 06:25 p.m. does anyone know where i can get the all black elan2e ?
the other controls the choice of focus  point, automatic or one of three selectable points.
as bob atkin mentioned about under exposure problem of eos50e, i found that  most people would notice more of this issue when shooting velvia like i do.
i find the manual is a bit of a joke the way they describe the metering modes.
andrei chris hay , june 16, 1999; 09:37 p.m. i have been a fan of canon manual cameras for 30 years.
in any case i have a trusty praktica bc1 which is my only manual focus camera to allows me to still enjoy the delights of basic photography!!
the egonormics of the camera is excellent and i have  nothing but praise for this camera.
it will be making its way to my camera bag.
the other controls the choice of focus point, automatic or one of three selectable points.
camera's autofocus/exposure randomly stops  working in the remote locations, like santa monica mountains.
really it is a wonder that you  can decode all of this, but you can.
there is a button on the back of the body which selects additional  functions: iso speed override auto exposure bracketing (+- 2 stops, 1/2 stop increments)
when i bought a little point and shoot thinking it might be fun to have a  camera once again i never dreamed of the obsession which would take hold.
i need some meat though, something to light up the  night with.
so much for that useless custom function, duh for canon engineers).
there are two things i'd like  to say about that: 1.
there are too many buttons already!!!
i chose the elan iie over the a2e because it's controls could be accessed in one step (i.e., flip the switch, turn a nob) instead of click the button and then roll the dial around while looking at some display.
the rebel 2000 became lighter and more compact than its predecessors with significantly improved features!
maybe i should be nice for a moment the elan 7e does have a dedicated dof preview button it is slightly smaller (doesn't work for my big hands) and a whole massive super duper 15 grams (nothing) lighter than elan iie.
the multiple frame forward is slower than on the n-70, but it will still eat your film pretty quickly.
the elan iie is so quiet that any improvement in the film transport system makes no difference because the mirror is what makes the most noise.
now i am a proud owner of an eos-1n, and haven't had any suprises yet.
i was playing around with it
and i use a 100/2.8 tamron macro, this  lens is my favorite.
both zoom in and out trying to focus and then stop, out of  focus.
my interest was rekindled recently when i purchased a digital camera which comes with some manual controls.
i've take a look at the  "official" one and it seems quite simple although the minijack has  three bornes which puzzles me.
if canon makes the lens i'm looking for, and if i can afford it, i'll buy it.
it distributes the weight of  heavier lenses across the camera body.
i did not get the standard lens that comes with it, but instead i got the  new tamaron 28 - 300 f3.5/6.3 lens.
does this sound like a faulty camera or do others experience this ?
* partial metering linked to each af sensors *
this  isn't much and some people might not notice it, but i do.
turned out there was something wrong with the shutter.
for ted marcus: i missed the partial metering button, too, when i started  using my elan ii (i had a 500, before i bought the elan).
when you press the function button again it picks up at the last feature you diddled with, a nice ergonomic touch.
this is due to the lack of surge  capacity in commercial aa batteries.
usm,  100/2 usm, 200/2.8l usm), and now i'd like to get a body with a spot meter  which will work with the ex flashes (e-ttl), and the eos-3 fits the bill, but  it seems a bit pricey for a body.
i tried  it in stores, and even after calibrating, it still seemed gimmicky and more  like a toy than a tool for me.
the bp-50 battery pack takes aa batteries, which is very useful and saves having to buy the odd lithium cells which are now hard to find.
nikon to many seem to offer some equipment which goes contrary to the firms philosopy of making most of what it makes interchangeable with one camera body to another.
vinicius matangrano , january 30, 2000; 06:07 p.m. to john gallardo (and other elan ii recent users): please refer to http://www.advanix.com/~photo/bobatkins/info/faq30/flashfaq.htm.
robert young , september 01, 2011; 10:47 a.m. i got an elan ii
* auto bracketing * flash  exposure lock * flash exposure compensation contra: *ae lock and dofp are in the same buttom...
with canon, you have one on the body and one on the lens.
all  of the lenses, except for the 100/2.8 macro, are really quick and quiet.
the camera has never let me down yet, and has even survived being sprayed with a super-soaker (although it didn't take too heavy a hit).
german gomez , february 25, 2000; 07:12 p.m. i've bought this camera today, it's my first camera (yeah!)
there is a custom function (#9 i  think) though which allows the user to set the shutter speed at 125 in av mode.
so far i have done 2 weddings and several church functions with the elan ii and have never had a problem of any kind.
in  these circumstances i would never consider a 3rd party lens.
unfortunately, such a goodie is not available for the a2/elan ii, although the same part can be used on the 1n.
but with a little patience i got used to move the metering mode switch without looking at it.
if you use tex, you can find a sample source file for the labels at this  url: http://www.chem.helsinki.fi/~toomas/photo/cf-labels.html .
after calibration (which takes only seconds to complete) the eye control, including dof preview, is dead on with my glasses, sunglasses, or no glasses.
rechargable ni-cad's are so much cheaper in  the long run than li cells!
being used to an eos300 (rebel) and an  old 1000, this is a real step forward.
i did add the bp-50 vertical grip, and i'm waiting to use up the lithium  battery
is this widespread, or just a problem with a few bodies?
it has been knocking around africa and europe with me  and lives in a pelican case when not being used.
once i couldn't off the camera.
it feels a little on the cheesy side, very light weight, and made of the same material as the camera body.
the n70 lacks dof and multiple exposure.
i am about to buy an elan ii off ebay to use as a second body.
this does not  work with my tamron lens.
e-ttl is canon's answer to that.
excellent body and since canon  has replaced it with the 7e, the used price for the 2e i expect will remain  high.
the elan iie has an eye controlled dof preview feature which works around this problem.
if you see a shot where af is practical, just press the ae lock button and the camera will focus, probably better than you can.
the nett effect of this is that the housing  is much worse for wear, flash mount is mangled and qd thing has stopped working  (no loss).
i also bought a 100 to 300 usm
some diehard nikon fans call that an advantage (a heavier camera).
waiting for the overtime pay i'll get from work this  winter...
eye  controlled focussing works like a charm for me after just one calibration  cycle.
go for it, just don't get suckered into too many consumer level enhancements... pay the money!
it's gone through extreme elements, cluttered camera bags and dustly conditions  without a single problem.
the nikon f70 on the other hand does allow the user to select between slow sync  and normal sync but i believe that's the only advantage that camera has over  the elanii.
in addition to the usual dust,  rain, vibrations and soforth the camera has been dropped, hard, a couple of  times, had a heavy oak table collapse onto it and was thrown out of a car  window into a sand dune before being rolled over as the vehicle rolled down the  dune (had to dig to find camera).
sure, it has 35 zone metering and aprature preview, but other than that it was a rebel g. i also noticed it was not built quite as sturdy as the rebel g. i shot my first roll with it and by my second roll the pentaprizim was crooked.
paul gittins , july 31, 2000; 05:22 a.m. excellent reviews all round - i am glad now that i took the plunge this weekend and picked up this fine camera.
the egonormics of the camera is excellent and i have nothing but praise for this camera.
then the film cover latch broke.
the battery pack is a godsend if (like me) you are disorganised and end up running out of batteries somewhere where the only thing available is aa zinc-carbon.
i have all mid-range usm  lenses: the ef 20-35/3.5-4.5, the ef 28-105/3.5-4.5 and the ef 100-300/4.5-5.6.
as the scene grows more contrasty the evaluative metering becomes less trustworthy.
maybe you'd like to try a 24-85, it's a nice lens (take a look at the review).
if you couple this camera with the 380ex flash, you have one of the most  foolproof systems available.
excellent body and since canon has replaced it with the 7e, the used price for the 2e i expect will remain high.
that's a full stop ladies and gents!
i have hard time remembering what function controls what feature, and if i forget to put the manual in my camera bag (100% of the time) there is no hope of remembering anything except cf4 which i use constantly.
normally i prefer to leave cf4 set 1 which puts af start on the ae lock button and moves ae lock to the shutter release.
so if anyone  has any ideas, email me!
if you  see a shot where af is practical, just press the ae lock button and the camera  will focus, probably better than you can.
i also padded the outside of the body with black gaffer's tape for grip.
as i mentioned earlier, i have 3 upper middle class consumer zooms and a snazzy macro lens: i have also owned the ef 75-300/4-5.6 ii usm and i can't really recommend it.
i bought my elan iie may '97.
one walkthrough with the manual and i was ready to  go - the camera is logical and intuitive in its layout.
one other finding...when i tested the 28-80 usm iv lens, it performed extremely well with slides under a loupe.
the vertical grip comes in handy, and the elan iie/50e will even do eye controlled focusing while held vertically.
i have not lost my faith in canon, no i love thier  "one-handed" setup.
in program mode it handles program shift.
jonathan http://www.photosforsouls.com ashley pomeroy , march 27, 2011; 10:25 a.m. i bought one of these a couple of years ago - i was doing a series of blog posts about kodachrome film, and although i have an old olympus om-10, i wanted a more modern film body that was compatible with my eos lenses.
i'am glad that i made the  purchased.
one thing i still haven't figured out is the benefit of using center-weighted  averaging versus evaluative metering-- the 650 had only evaluative metering and  usually worked quite well with both slide and negative films.
only highly specialized professional work requires this, and only rarely at that.
my only recommendation for anybody looking to buy a canera is try whatever they are looking for out - hold it, shoot with it - and (excuse the lame qualitative term) see what "feels" right for you.
--pratik inge stubdal , october 30, 1999; 06:54 p.m. i am back - after having used my eos elan ii (eos 50) since late september  '99.
within two hours i understood every function, and have not once been confused by any of it.
i found this by mistake when  i went to switch out a partially used film cartridge.
the n70 is pretty much foolproof, but the controls were not at all intuitive.
still we see no implementation of the nikon d system, however they nicely copied the n80's focusing point selector.
the camera would then use  the flash's focusing light which was not blocked by the lenshood.
i had rather have 2 elans than one n-90s.
i've found that it  provides nicely filled shadows in outdoor portraits (or scenes which require  fill) with the flash set to -1 or -1.5 stops of compensation.
but i am not satisfied on the quality, hard the focus realy sharp, not realy that sharp pics.
of course all of this flash trickery only works with the canon 380ex which  is a reasonable unit by itself.
don't get me wrong though.
i saw jan kozak had similar problems and mailed him, it seems he ended up giving the camera to his son :-(
toan nguyen , april 26, 2000; 04:35
the same comments apply to the performance of the 20-35.
i find i like the eye-control a lot more than i thought i  would, especially the dof preview activated by looking at the little  parallelogram in the corner of the screen...too cool!
in the "creative zone" modes the  metering mode chosen by the 3 position switch under the command dial,  evaluative, partial or centerweighted averaging, is used.
still takes beautiful pictures, and everything works.
in contrast canon put it in as soon as the technology is available and allows the general public to make their minds up whenther
and the bp50 doesn't have  its own main dial and fe/focus point buttons!
the great thing about  this configuration is that you can manually focus or use auto focus as the  situation dictates without having to change the focus mode.
i took a  wild guess that canon would only use one protocol for remote controls, and i  was right - it works... handy as canon's web site (uk, anyway) doesn't even say  which remote should be used.
the weight of the camera is nicely balanced, giving you a solid feel.
it's the one i take when i only take one.
this is  my first slr, and i found it really easy to use...
what function controls what feature, and if i forget to put the manual in my  camera bag (100% of the time) there is no hope of remembering anything except  cf4 which i use constantly.
eos 50e does lack spot meter, interchangeable viewfinder, 21 point evaluative metering among other things.
i also read mixed reviews on how effective this feature really is.
now mind you, my serious work is still done with an old rb -  weddings, portraits, product photos - but photography is also my hobby.
i have used a really, really old pentax ex ii camera - that was the camera  i learned photography on.
now i am a proud owner of an eos-1n, and haven't had any  suprises yet.
after sending camera to canon, they replaced the contacts and the upper plate (printed on icons were coming off from my daily use).
being used to an eos300 (rebel) and an old 1000, this is a real step forward.
welcome to photo.net:
, my experience in using this as an advanced ameteur/student has been overall good.
i found it invaluable when i was hiking, in order to get certain shots  to come out just right.
the portion of the frame metered by partial mode is tied to the focus point which is currently selected.
a.m. i have been using eos 50e for about 1 year.
on a recent trip to yosemite i was shooting in the valley near sunrise and  ran into a situation where my calculation and the camera's recommendation  differed wildly, with the camera recommending much more exposure than i had  calculated.
in aperature priority mode (av) and shutter priority mode (tv), you are stuck with having your flash sync permanently set at slow sync.
so far i've had a grand total of 1 picture out of focus, and that was because i  was too close to my subject and hoped that the dof of a 24mm lens would save  me.
there have been some comments as to a dimmer viewfinder or problems focusing, canon changed the reflectivity of the mirror to give the cmos sensors a little more light, so you get less, and yet the cmos af and metering sensor still offers inferior performance vs the elan ii ccd sensor.
although you give up alot in terms of quick composition and lens versitility, the pictures i have taken with the new 50 /1.4
i considered the sigma series of lenses but in the end went for the  starter kit canon lens (28-80 usm).
i  took some pictures with it and was not very satisfied with the results,  preferring the output from a p&s camera.
thanks to all of the advise from phil and all of the other people posting here and in other related sites, i bought a elan iie with a 28-105 lens.
i've been pleased so far with canons...
i tried it out in the store and basically felt it was a  gimmick given how easy it was to set the focus point manually and how well the  automatic focus point selection worked.
i  settled on the canon elan ii.
i have all mid-range usm lenses: the ef 20-35/3.5-4.5, the ef 28-105/3.5-4.5 and the ef 100-300/4.5-5.6.
the n70 does seem rather awkward - although i lked  the grip better on it.
hundreds of rolls of film have gone through my camera, and it has given me  pictures as i envisioned them with great ease.
and for the return of the cash in with canon rebates at the end of september.
probably the eye-controlled focus point selection on the  iie works better than on the eos-5/a2e, a body introduced in 1992 --
for ted marcus: i missed the partial metering button, too, when i started using my elan ii (i had a 500, before i bought the elan).
in spite  of my weak german language knowledge i learned to use all its functions in no  more than two hours.
after my first few rolls of film, i was very satisfied with the prints  taken with my 28 - 105 usm lens (acting on the advice of many photo.net users).
i feel that it's hard to go wrong with this camera if you're looking to get into photography more seriously (i.e. as a hobbiest rather than an occassional tourist shooter) and want versatility and affordability.
now, half year later, i am sharing my experience with you.
well - the flash system is pretty lame - with my sunpak  pz4000 setup or with my 220ex (a pretty useless flash) i've seen exposures come  out much worse than an n70 and its built in flash.
50e is a  type a camera and hence is compatible with the ex flashes.
with that camera i can't even see the whole viewfinder with my  glasses off!
sure, it has 35 zone metering and aprature preview, but other than that it was  a rebel g. i also noticed it was not built quite as sturdy as the rebel g.
why do cannon have the af/mf setting on the lens and not on the camera?
this does not work with my tamron lens.
i decided to try some different lenses, first i tried the tamron 28 to  300mm.
i took a wild guess that canon would only use one protocol for remote controls, and i was right - it works... handy as canon's web site (uk, anyway) doesn't even say which remote should be used.
the plastic, although textured, got slippery after a while, in my experience.
for example, i often use either auto  bracketing or flash compensation.
i haven't used the camera with 2cr5s, so it may just be a problem with aas.
i guess the n-70 is better at knowing the range to target..
positive thinking it may help to develop the habit of carefully viewing all the view finder information before pressing the shutter.
i have not lost my faith in canon, no i love thier "one-handed" setup.
i bought with the camera, the shopper told me that it is has a very good  value/cost ratio, but as i've already said i'm totally new to this, and i have  little money to expend on it (mainly because i'm not confidence enough to  expend more money).
it's lite enough to be carried anywhere.
one of the principle innovations contained in the elan ii/iie is e-ttl flash exposure.
this selects each focus point in turn and then selects automatic focus  point selection mode.
conclusion: should have listened to phil and gotten eos-5.
you adjust the function setting with the main dial which is located behind the shutter release.
shutter speeds and lightning fast motor drives?
but a had my problems to, not all brand batteries fit well as said by luciano costa.
other than that it seems fine.
here's a note from javier henderson ...
that's never happened for me before, i won't say i owe it all to the canon elan ii, but the camera helped me immensely because it didn't stand in my way.
and i don't find it too reliable (this is with the on-camera flash, not with an ex).
it's a camera whose capabilities one can  grow into, and which is unlikely to ever be limiting for most users.
if you are uk based, then i can't recommend mxv highly enough -  http://www.mxv.co.uk/ - they are professional, friendly and very, very helpful,  if something is a lemon, they will tell you - and if don't live in sussex  (myself included) then they will ship it out to you for about £7 on  approval...
i have had only good experiences as  far as exposure and mechanics goes.

i have a website that displays some of the pictures i took with my rebel g, and like 2 that i took with the 2000, but i am constantly updateing it as new pictures find thier way onto film, and soon some actuall elan ii pictures will be showing up there, i encourage you to visit it and let me know what you think.
it is also fast enough to catch a variety  of positions of divers, race cars and jumping dolphins.
agnius griskevicius , june 30, 1997; 06:56 p.m.
i must say that it was an impulse deal - so it's good to hear your  comments on it.
first of all, its layout and handling is exemplary, perhaps one of the best of any camera ever.
speed is not important though in my current assignments.
so i did the dumb thing and got a rebel 2000.
one thing i think it should improve is that the meter goes off too fast  after shooting.
one of the really neat things about it is its  ability to sync up at all shutter speeds when you use high speed sync mode.
mjh vinicius matangrano , february 23, 1999; 05:47 p.m.
those cameras need it a hell of a lot more with 45 af points.
about the servo af,  i suggest that you set cf4 to 1, to link af to the back button.
even still, i returned it, the rebel g body and the 35-80 i bought with it and now own the much-heavier elan iie and 28-105 3.5-4-5.
in fast action photography the selection speed is unacceptable.
anyway, it's a great camera!
i found out that i was loosing a lot of shots focusing the camera, so after much research, decided to purchase the elan iie.
i must congratulate the components on being a lot more rugged than they look and feel, because they have sustained severe abuse and keep working.
originally i had a sanyo battery and when it wouldn't work i switched to a panasonic with the piece of card.
i wish everyone a happy new century.
unfortunately, it does not have the very useful multi-function dial found on the elan ii/50 (e), which is a shame.
i use the depth of field, bulb with remote control rc-1, and film leader out functions all the time.
this camera with the 28-105 lens is a perfect combination.
edwyn michael walker , august 15, 1999; 11:05 p.m. in july of 1998 i finally saved up enough money to buy a canon rebel g. sure i had researched the elan ii (e) and would have loved to buy it, but alas, it was well out of my price range.
to change focus point, you  need to press the focus point selection button and then spin the main control  dial.
flash one of the principle innovations contained in the elan ii/iie is e-ttl  flash exposure.
the same week i  ran into a dealer selling a mint 100-300 usm canon 4.5-5.6 for $160 ( with a  canon skylight filter included) at the spring photographic show at waltham high  school.
piaw na , march 20, 1998; 01:40 a.m. thomas, i've never had the problem you describe with cf2.
i first thought my camera was defective, but when i had a look at other specimens in the store, they all did the same thing.
when i am out, it shows no power, when i get  indoors it is full.
contributed content used with permission.
i just wish it had more focussing points, and  more weatherproofing (so that rain needn't stop play).
i'm still waiting for it to get here, but from  what i've read, i made the right choice!!
i use slides and sometimes i just change film speed from 100 to 64 to have better results.
every time i go out in autumn or winter my battery indicator gets crazy.
the all black elan ii has been around shortly after the initial elan ii  launch.
i would  never send something so messed up to other service centers.
go for it, just don't get suckered into  too many consumer level enhancements... pay the money!
well, tomorrow i'll get all my pictures, so that'll be exciting :) alex yap , october 01, 1999; 02:17 a.m. i just got my eos 55/elan iie qd back from the shops.
so is this really a problem with all elan  iie's ?
i did notice a few things about it.
this is so much easier to use than the rebel xs that  it isn't even funny -- when using manual mode on the rebel changing  aperture/shutter speed combinations required lots of button punching/holding  and was in general a pain in the ass.
p.m. i purchased my elan iie exactly one year ago and for the most part, i love it.
finally, there is the ef 100/2.8 macro.
dan myung , april 04, 2000; 01:50
i also found there was lots of distortion in the corners at the wider angles.
the elan ii has not let them down.
finally, there are two buttons on the back of the camera right behind the  lcd.
i really like being able  to move the af to the back button, that's a truly nice feature.
* auto bracketing * flash exposure lock * flash exposure compensation contra: *ae lock and dofp are in the same buttom...
i use slides and sometimes i just change film speed from 100 to 64 to  have better results.
usm, 100/2 usm, 200/2.8l usm), and now i'd like to get a body with a spot meter which will work with the ex flashes (e-ttl), and the eos-3 fits the bill, but it seems a bit pricey for a body.
i made my decision mostly based by  information i found here.
for most, wanting more than this camera offers is just ego talking.
ergnomics with this slr is fantastic and i find it easier to use than my eos 10.
supposedly, it's supposed to be called the a3, but that's just rumor right now.
i thought it was the height  of technological achievement because i could focus with the lens wide open
if anyone has objections, may i say that i have tried almost everything that has been made in 35mm and can't recall anyone having enthused more for any other camera maker.
my first three rolls resulted in a total of three of the best pictures i have ever taken.
the controls quickly become second nature.
since i never use the  self timer i always leave it in mirror prefire mode.
i bought a refurbished elan ii from b&h photo in august.
unfortunately (i think, maybe you don't), i guess your lens won't allow you to manually focus without switching to "mf", so that you could take full advantage of this really useful custom function.
would the grip help this, by adding weight?
when there are weird  shadows and bright spots (tricky metering), i switch it to partial mode and  this yeilds pretty good results generally.
on the elan ii the dof preview is enabled by setting custom function 4 (cf4) to 2.
press the shutter release halfway to register your setting.
and for the return of the cash in with canon rebates at the end of  september.
i probable like the n-90s better, but not enough to justify the 500  dollars difference in cost.
two stores in the seattle area said two completely different things - one  recommended the n-70, and nikon over canon all the way, while the other store  elevated canon.
it attaches to the camera by means of the tripod socket (the bp50 has in turn a tripod socket).
-ksk cliff lesergent , june 21, 1998; 11:40 a.m. one of the few things i dislike about the elan iie is the tacky aluminum finish.
the built-in flash disappointed me often (and mysteriously died 2 years ago), but the fel function with the 380ex gives me very precise and predictable results.
it has fewer preset 'modes' for taking special kinds of pictures (portraits/sport/macro etc..) than the n-70, but as far as i can tell, these are only specific combinations of shutter speed and aperture, so you would want to setthese yourself anyways.
there is a switch just above it  which enables and disables it so that you cannot accidentally set exposure  compensation.
the built-in flash disappointed me often (and mysteriously died 2 years ago),  but the fel function with the 380ex gives me very precise and predictable  results.
aside from that, i have no complaints... great camera, love it lots!
i would also like to mention that photo.net was what actually caused my decision to get a new slr in the first place.
also, if you use the built-in flash for fill  (or worse yet, your main flash), the battery runs down rather quickly.
the battery pack is a godsend if (like me)
once i'm through using the function pressing  the button once and the turning the special function off is easy.
both zoom in and out trying to focus and then stop, out of focus.
while every positive comments above regarding  this camera is true, i traded mine in for an a2 after a year.
i've also bought a couple of filters (a1 instead of a uv - don't  know if that was good or bad, as it warms tones just a little bit) and a  circular polarizer.
shun cheung compares the sb-900, sb-800, sb-600, and sb-400, and  offers detailed specs on the flashes.
p.m. i used to own an elaniie.
sometimes i think i'm getting too lazy, especialy when i remain my prevoius full manual zenit camera.
all in all  i have been pleasantly surprised.
i, too, found that the lower iso films (50, 100) are underexposed, no matter how i expose them.
i just feel as though the camera is allowing me to concentrate on composing more then on the mechanics of focusing and setting the exposure.
it will be making its  way to my camera bag.
it's  just a switch or has some kind of electronics on it?
none of the new york places seem to have  it.
i was never limited by  it because i was "to good" for the camera.
i bought the 28-105 to replace the truly awful ef 35-80/4-5.6 ii which came  with my rebel xs kit.
it  is a three position knob which selects one shot focus, ai focus or ai servo  focus modes.
if there was a way to put the exposed film into a machine that spits out twenty megapixel 16-bit tiff files a few hours later i would probably use the eos 50 more often, but as it stands i leave it on a shelf most of the time, and occasionally move it around, take it down to check if it still works, dust it etc.
this dial falls naturally under your thumb and makes adjusting exposure  compensation or aperture a snap.
i've found that it provides nicely filled shadows in outdoor portraits (or scenes which require fill) with the flash set to -1
i will continue to be a loyal patron.
mlu prefire * evaluative flash metering (e-ttl ) with high speed flash sync (via pulses, up to 1/4000) *
this is a little problem - as the camera doesn't seem to do af correctly in low light enviroments without the af assist beam.
there is a button on the back of the body which selects additional functions: push this button multiple times to cycle through the various functions.
the pictures were pretty good, there was of course some distortion at the wide end 24mm but all around a useful lens for travel.
i still think that no matter what,  they make the best optics!!!
this is so much easier to use than the rebel xs that it isn't even funny -- when using manual mode on the rebel changing aperture/shutter speed combinations required lots of button punching/holding and was in general a pain in the ass.
is the elan7e any better built than the elan ii?
however, after a strict period of shooting velvia with this body, i noticed 1/3 stop under exposure problem on other film like elite 100 as well which i had used to test this new system.
i must congratulate the  components on being a lot more rugged than they look and feel, because they  have sustained severe abuse and keep working.
it seemed to me that the n-70 was better at adjusting the focus automatically when the distance shifted greatly - but i haven't double-checked this yet (same lenses though).
the nikon sits in a camera bag while the elan is my new mekissa hutson , february 11, 1999; 02:54 p.m. i have done a lot of research before i decided to but a new camera.
if anyone knows a way around this, i would be greatful!!
i wanted a wider range than the 35-80 and the  28-105 seemed to "fit" better with the elan iie.
this probably isn't noticable in most scenes, but i'd be curious if  anyone else has seen this.
i'm in love with my 100 macro usm...
i  shot my first roll with it and by my second roll the pentaprizim was crooked.
servo never seemed to work well for me.

i'm so used to the elan ii that  i actually returned the eos 5 in exchange for the all black elan 55.
this is particular problematic when exposure compensation is set, that do not allow time to reset it to normal.
it came down to personal taste, and the accessibility of functions on the elon ii.
now, at the end of the summer, i decided to move up.
ecf works amazingly well.
the viewfinder displays an adequate amount of information; is very clear for shoot mouth, better than for example, yashica dental eye(!!!)
also, if this is happening with only two lenses, it's probably not  the camera.
i just wish that canon would come out with a 540ex.
sometimes they are right, sometimes they  are not.
originally i had a sanyo battery and when it wouldn't work i switched to a  panasonic with the piece of card.
sometimes i think i'm getting  too lazy, especialy when i remain my prevoius full manual zenit camera.
since the 380ex  is fully automatic you can't really use it to do fancy manual flash tricks, but  if you only want fill and don't want to use it for macro work, etc.
at 500$, it gives me, as an amateur, a good all-round lens.
is there going to be a replacement for the a2 any time soon?
it feels a little on the cheesy side, very light weight, and made of the  same material as the camera body.
i found it is a good camera overall but i would like to put 2 complaints about it.
basic features the elan ii is a pretty fully featured camera.
i know some of you don't like the af assist, but that is why there was a custom function to disable it on the elan iie.
i have fairly small hands and all of the controls fall readily  under my fingers and the camera operates quickly and intuitively.
1/200 sync speed vs 1/125; 3) 5 focusing points vs. 3 4) much much quieter film advance 5)more useful vertical grip.
i have had only good experiences as far as exposure and mechanics goes.
but if i wanted to do that i could just go manual and set it to that speed much faster than going through the custom function list.
did i mention the camera is light?
meter is right on the money, and no "experimental" or "work in progress" features.
travis deane , february 28, 2001; 12:15 a.m. you can use infared film
so far, i've been pleased  with the camera.
generally, in tricky lighting i switch to using a handheld 1  degree spotmeter and use the camera in manual mode.
the elan lets me shoot without  thinking about using my equipment.
i must say that it was an impulse deal - so it's good to hear your comments on it.
everything worked fine and dandy when i got the camera, but the more i used it, the worse it got.
rich buttiglieri , april 07, 1998; 03:33 p.m. you can't use ir film because the frame counter in side uses an ir beam to  count the sprocket holes.
i recently got the 200/2.8l ii, and the 1.4x and 2x extenders, and this  thing seems to overpower the body (i'm almost afraid of breaking the body when  i put the 200/2.8l on it).
the elan ii is certainly lighter than the 650, and the control layout may  turn out to be more convenient once i get used to it.
i've graduated from the pic  modes (portrait, landscape, etc) and find myself using the programmed and dep  mode mostly.
i went back to my old canon 5000 and realised that the camera was very  limited in its functions.
in this way canon is able to incorporate the necessary technology in its new cameras as soon as comsumer feedback is available.
if you couple this camera with the 380ex flash, you have one of the most foolproof systems available.
all the other types of film i've used have been exposed quite well.
buying it originally with a piece of junk tokina 28-300 lens (i'm happy with my 28-105 usm now).
and the repair costs 40% of the camera  price.
if canon supplied a sticker for the bottom of the camera which allowed you to connect the numbers with a name life would be much easier.
i'm thinking of either the a2 (but would rather wait for the update to the a2, if there is one), or the eos-3.
however, when checking for consistent  exposures across the range of f stops, (blue sky at 80mm), i noticed a white  haze in the center of the frame (diffraction?) at the smaller apertures  (f22-38).
one of my friends with a nikon had the same problem  with the same type and roll-batch of film (fuji sensia ii 100), so i ignored it  and considered it a problem with the emusion.
with my normal kodacrome 64 films i never had this problem.
shutter  speeds and lightning fast motor drives?
camera's autofocus/exposure randomly stops working in the remote locations, like santa monica mountains.
often i check my calculated exposure against the exposure recommended by the meter and they seldom vary by more than 1/2 stop or so.
one thing i think it should improve is that the meter goes off too fast after shooting.
but, buy the iie instead of  the ii because the eye-controlled dof preview is a more important feature than  you might think.
but the problem  here is that you can't have both af start on the ae lock button and dof preview  on the ae lock button at the same time.
as i mentioned earlier, i have 3 upper middle class consumer zooms and a  snazzy macro lens: ef 28-105/3.5-4.5 usm ef 100-300/4.5-5.6 usm ef 100/2.8 macro i have also owned the ef 75-300/4-5.6 ii usm
however, i have found situations where a subject was underexposed because of objects in the foreground which i was using to frame the main subject (it wouldn't have worked anyway...).
this camera has everything a photographer needs....... except for 1 thing.
the elan iie has the best control system in the eos line!
(i read all the  comments about under-exposure)
i bought the 28-105 to replace the truly awful ef 35-80/4-5.6 ii which came with my rebel xs kit.
the all black elan2 looks ten times better than the silver one we are all used to.

some  pictures are underexposed
should i complain to canon ?
i've 2 elan iie (or 55, the japanese version), one is the orginal black/silver and the other the all black.
when i bought a little point and shoot thinking it might be fun to have a camera once again i never dreamed of the obsession which would take hold.
are you sure your elan isn't defective?
my camera tends to underexpose in some  lighting conditions, especially in low light or backlight, when using matrix  metering.
second, it's durable enough for rough amateur use.
i absolutely must carry the n70 manual everywhere.
next to these two buttons is the "quick control dial".
