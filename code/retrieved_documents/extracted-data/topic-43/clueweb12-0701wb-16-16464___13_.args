easy to use and navigate, the camera mode menu caters for most situations and image quality is fine, although a tripod is best employed in some situations.easy auto mode works as expected and is essentially an advanced automated option that auto-selects the best available settings for the scene at hand.at the longest end the 420mm holds fairly steadily and, while optical stabilisation would have been an advantage here to further steady ‘live' during framing, the sensor-shift stabilisation helps provide further assurance of a sharper image capture.the jpegs have more highlight detail than is apparent on the lcd screen, which can make for some difficulty in providing accurate exposure.the primary purpose of the l110 is, of course, being a superzoom and utilising that 15x optical zoom which extends smoothly and with a regular pace.the 3in lcd screen to the rear is of good quality, though is overly-bright when compared to viewing images on a computer screen - so much so that the former makes some image areas appear overexposed when they're not.low-light situations add the benefit of an af-assist lamp which includes the option to turn it off should this be undesireable.if the image quality was improved then this would be recommended.ipc media limited, owner of whatdigitalcamera.co.uk, will collect your personal information solely to process your request.also there is no viewfinder as per some competitors' superzoom compacts, so no other way to conceive taking an image when in bright sunlight.the l110 also has ‘color options' to change shooting styles from standard to vivid, b&w, sepia or cyanotype too.in use the nikon coolpix l110 feels good in the hand and the zoom control is smooth.coolpix l110 is not professinal camera.shows poor perfomance in low light thogh it has an iso ranging from 80-6400.no manual mode,shutter speed and aperture cannot be set manually.nikon l110 review - click for full size image low-light situations add the benefit of an af-assist lamp which includes the option to turn it off should this be undesireable., i have been using canon film slr cameras and my first digital camera is still fuji 2mp 203, many of my friends have canon digital cameras and no doubt very good quality, i need aa batteries "a must have" , a nice view finder, 8 to 14 mp and manual mode option with a price range up to 200$ camera, i know canon's g11 is a great camera
