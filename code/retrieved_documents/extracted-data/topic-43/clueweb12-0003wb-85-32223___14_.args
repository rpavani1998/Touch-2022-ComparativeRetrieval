with its “live view” feature, achieving critical focus for static subjects offers an unprecedented ability to squeeze every bit of resolution out of the system, especially at wide apertures.the nikon d40, d40x, d50, d80 are excellent cameras, ergonomically superior in multiple ways to the equivalent canon offerings.such efforts demonstrate a serious commitment to quality and innovation .in short, canon’s eos 1d mark iii is a superbly-built sports camera, offering an incredible ten (10) frames per second, and a gaggle of ground-breaking features never before available in a professional-caliber camera, including “live view”, a self-cleaning sensor, true 14-bit color, a 3" lcd, silent mode, iso 6400, and a variety of other improvements.nikon’s prime-lens designs are dated, not using ed glass and aspherics adequately or at all, and optically mediocre for today’s digital cameras.the newly-announced canon eos 1d mark iii promises outstanding focus speed and accuracy.with the late-february announcement of the new canon eos 1d mark iii , the comparison seems very unfavorable for nikon’s d2x and even worse for the d2h. in short, canon’s eos 1d mark iii is a superbly-built sports camera, offering an incredible ten (10) frames per second, and a gaggle of ground-breaking features never before available in a professional-caliber camera, including “live view”, a self-cleaning sensor, true 14-bit color, a 3" lcd, silent mode, iso 6400, and a variety of other improvements.so “switching” to canon really just means divesting myself of nikon equipment i’m unlikely to use, while keeping items that would prove useful should nikon’s offerings become more appealing—a camera is a tool and i need not sell all my tools,some of which are better for one job or another.the nikon d200 doesn’t just compare favorably to the canon 5d, it surpasses it in build quality, having a sealed body, larger and easier to use buttons and other positive characteristics (seed2x vs eos and d200 vs d2x).the 5d offers a larger viewfinder and higher resolution which for many users is the deciding factor.focus accuracy problems with the nikon d2x have cost me not just photos but considerable time re-shooting.in short, nikon is extremely competitive in the sub-$2000 range, and there is currently no rational reason for a photographer looking at that class of camera to be disappointed in any way with nikon.so “switching” to canon really just means divesting myself of nikon equipment i’m unlikely to use, while keeping items that would prove useful should nikon’s offerings become more appealing—a camera is a toolcanon’s 135mm f/2l is optically outstanding, and it autofocuses accurately and instantly, quite unlike nikon’s dated and clunky135mm f/2 dc, which has specially-bred chipmunks living inside to turn the focusing mechanism.focus errors focus accuracy problems with the nikon d2x have cost me not just photos but considerable time re-shooting.
