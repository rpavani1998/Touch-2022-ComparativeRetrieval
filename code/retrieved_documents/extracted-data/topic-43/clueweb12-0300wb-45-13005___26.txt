this accelerates the already snappy focusing time by following the subject's movement before the shutter release button is pressed half way (only works when the focus is set to multi af or spot af).

s10 camera unit a12  camera unit one other benefit of the interchangeable camera unit that ricoh is  promoting is the avoidance of dust on the sensor.
the innovative ricoh gxr does carry a rather substantial price premium, costing  £419/€459/$550 for the body, £600/€670/$550 for the  a12/50mm unit, and £330/€370/$440 for the s10/24-72mm unit.
disregarding any differences in image quality, it seems to us that the s10 is almost exactly replicating one of ricoh's existing compacts in the gxr format, albeit in a larger size and perhaps more importantly with a much bigger price-tag.
this is a great feature the helps bridge the gap between compact and dslr cameras.

more interesting is the a12 unit, which has a 12.3 aps-c image sensor and a 50mm f/2.5 fixed-focal macro lens.
in the fastest  continuous mode the camera takes 3 frames per second with the 50mm unit but  only 1.6 fps with the 24-72mm unit, both rates for an unlimited number of jpeg  or raw images, which doesn't compare particularly well to even entry-level  dslrs.
you can additionally buy the completely removable optical viewfinder,  the new vf-2.
level compensation allows you to correct the contrast and tone of an image  after it has been taken, and white balance compensation the white balance.
on the focusing side, the  multi af system has 9 separate auto focus points, and there's also spot af,  manual focus, snap mode (can be changed to focus at either 1m, 2.5m, 5m or  infinity) and infinity.
the  skew correction function alters any photo that was taken at an angle so it  appears as if it were taken directly in front of you.
for everyone else, the gxr is simply a joy  to use for any photographer that wants full control over their camera, with  proven handling and a seemingly infinite level of customisation.
in all this discussion about the benefits of particular lens and sensor combinations, it quickly becomes apparent that ricoh are playing something of a guessing game with their camera unit offerings, hoping that they've hit upon the best solutions for the majority of photographers.
most dslrs now employ some kind of built-in dust reduction / shake system to try and automatically remove the dust from the sensor, although you invariably need to clean it using a third-party solution or have it cleaned periodically by the manufacturer.
with the gxr, the closed nature of the system promises to keep the image sensor dust-free, and i we certainly couldn't detect any in the images that we shot.
located on the top right of the camera (viewed from the rear) are the mode dial and what ricoh refer to as the up-down dial, and on the back is the adj. dial.
the display button toggles detailed settings information about each picture on and off, such as the iso rating and aperture / shutter speed, and there is a small histogram available during both shooting and playback.
there are over 20 external controls, leaving just enough room for that gorgeous 3 inch lcd screen.
the new flag function  setting option allows you to choose up to 20 images that can then be quickly  played back by selecting the flag function display option, useful for showing  off key images.
in terms of metering, the multi metering mode is 256 segment, and there's also center weighted average and spot metering.
compared to the direct competition, it's better than the  panasonic gf1's viewfinder, but not quite as good as the olympus e-p2's.
there are three main menus, shooting, key custom options and setup.
the ricoh gxr is a wide and fairly slim camera that is a little big bigger  than the palm of my average sized hands, measuring 113.9 mm (w) x 70.2 mm (h) x
the high resolution  lcd provides a wide viewing angle and high contrast., with a special fluorine  coat and hard coating to help prevent scratches, and 100% srgb coverage for  more accurate color reproduction.
both text and images really come alive on a  simply breath-taking display that's the best of any camera that we've ever  reviewed, including those with comparable 920k dot screens.
can ricoh succeed with their gxr interchangeable camera  unit system?
completing the gxr's extensive range of  focusing options is pre-af.
the 50mm unit is a little slower, with a distinct  pause as it physically moves in and out before locking onto the subject, and it  often failed to focus at all on low-contrast subjects.
completing the gxr's extensive range of focusing options is pre-af.
on the flip side, though, dust can also get in via the lens barrel, particularly of a zoom lens, so it will be interesting to see if long-term users report problems, especially as there's obviously no way to clean the sensor yourself, or any automatic dust-reduction system built into the gxr body.
this is an excellent move by ricoh, with no waiting  required for third-party software vendors like adobe, phase one dxo to play  catch-up.
press it in to alter white balance, iso speed, quality, image settings and the af target, which allows you to shift the target for af or ae or both without having to move the camera.
the navigation pad on the rear offers fn1 and fn2 settings, both of which can be re-configured to (by default they change the focus type and the manual flash amount) and pressing up and down increases and decreases exposure compensation.
if you have never used a digital camera before, or you're upgrading from a  more basic model, reading the comprehensive and easy-to-follow manual before  you start is a must.
quite a lot  of the camera's main options, such as image size, sharpness, metering mode and  continuous mode, are accessed here, so the shooting settings menu has 23  options spread over 3 screens, the key custom options menu has 16 options, and  the setup menu has 34 options.
when the gxr is fitted with this unit, it's automatically in the same league as a dslr or the other compact cameras that have an aps-c sensor, the sigma dp1 and dp2.
finally, the gxr uses an up/down rocker switch on the back of the camera for operating the zoom when used with an applicable camera unit (and image magnification during playback), although disappointingly it can't be re-configured when used with the a12 / 50mm unit.
with a conventional dslr, it's inherently much  easier to change the lens and retain the same sensor - with the gxr system, at  least on launch, you have to accept the change of both lens and sensor, and the  particular combinations on offer.
the choice of  the 50mm macro lens is also interesting, in that a focal length of 50mm is  useful for street photography as well as close-ups of flowers, providing an  angle of view roughly equivalent to human vision, and the fast maximum aperture  of f/2.5 is a real benefit for low-light shooting and creating that  out-of-focus bokeh look.
the gxr will feel instantly familiar to anyone who has used a recent ricoh compact before, as it inherits the design approach and many of the features from the gr and gx series cameras.
as mentioned above, there are only two camera unit options available when the gxr launches towards the end of this month (with more promised by ricoh for 2010), and we'll briefly consider each one here.
this allows you to  configure the gxr for different uses and allows quick access to each  configuration (the camera remembers the settings when it's turned off).
when pressed a graphical representation of most of the  key settings is displayed on the lcd, very similar to the system that many  dslrs offer.
one other benefit of the interchangeable camera unit that ricoh is promoting is the avoidance of dust on the sensor.
images are automatically rotated during playback to fit the current orientation of the camera.
when taking a photo, pressing the display button toggles between the detailed information, the histogram and gridlines to aid composition.
this is an excellent move by ricoh, with no waiting required for third-party software vendors like adobe, phase one dxo to play catch-up.
the s10 incorporates a 10 megapixel 1/1.7-inch image sensor and a 24-72mm,  3x zoom lens.
returning to the camera body, there are four external controls which form the creative heart of the gxr.
the  white saturation display mode during image playback indicates over-exposed  highlights by flashing those areas on and off.
once you have captured a photo, the gxr has an above average range of  options when it comes to playing, reviewing and managing your images.
you  can view the horizontal indicator on the lcd monitor to ensure that shots are  aligned horizontally.
the display button toggles detailed settings information about  each picture on and off, such as the iso rating and aperture / shutter speed,  and there is a small histogram available during both shooting and playback.

the all-metal tripod mount is the final give-away sign that this is intended to be a serious product, although the design of the interchangeable unit camera system means that it's not in-line either with the lens or the centre of the body.

in summary the ricoh gxr is a remarkably intuitive and customisable camera,  especially considering that it's a first-generation product in a completely new  photographic system.
utilising a magnesium alloy body, the gxr is an extremely well-built  camera, continuing the long-established ricoh tradition of producing serious  photographic tools.
the s10 incorporates a 10 megapixel 1/1.7-inch image sensor and a 24-72mm, 3x zoom lens.
personally speaking, i would have preferred to see the s10 use an aps-c sensor rather than the tiny 1/1.7-inch sensor - if i'm going to use a larger camera than ricoh's existing compacts, then i'd prefer a bigger sensor with all the image quality benefits that it hopefully provides.

we did briefly consider splitting this review into two separate articles, one for each camera unit, as the combined nature of the lens and image sensor makes the gxr seem like a different camera when each one is fitted, if not from a handling point-of-view then certainly from a image quality perspective.
these controls allow you to choose which  shooting mode you want to use, with a choice of full auto, program shift,  aperture-priority, shutter-priority and full manual, and to control the  settings of the particular mode that you have picked.
that ultimately means that some photographers are going to be left out, as ricoh obviously can't make every combination available.

even the maximum aperture range - f/2.5-4.4 - is identical!
it doesn't sound like a big deal in theory, but in practice it really helps to make all those wide-angle shots perfectly level.
located on the top right of the camera (viewed  from the rear) are the mode dial and what ricoh refer to as the up-down dial,  and on the back is the adj. dial.
a new addition to the gxr is the direct button, positioned to the far left  above the lcd screen.

the high resolution lcd provides a wide viewing angle and high contrast., with a special fluorine coat and hard coating to help prevent scratches, and 100% srgb coverage for more accurate color reproduction.
this is perfectly acceptable for its main use as a dedicated macro lens, but makes it less suitable for street photographer where every second counts.
due to the high-resolution lcd screen and  restricting the number of on-screen choices to 10, the various options and  icons are clear and legible.
this is a unique offering in the ricoh  range, and is notably the first ever ricoh camera to feature the same-sized  sensor that the majority of dslrs use.
furthermore, pressing the adj. dial allows you to quickly adjust 5  different settings that are commonly used.

the gxr is bigger and heavier than the gr digital iii, but not by as much as you'd first imagine, and it's a little smaller and lighter than the panasonic gf1, the previous holder of the "world's smallest and lightest interchangeable lens camera" title.
focusing with the 24-72mm camera unit is quick in good light, taking less than  0.5 seconds, and the camera happily achieves focus most of the time indoors or  in low-light situations.

with the gxr, the closed nature of the system  promises to keep the image sensor dust-free, and i we certainly couldn't detect  any in the images that we shot.
compared to ricoh’s popular range of compacts, the gxr is bigger and heavier, but not by too much.
it takes about 0.5 second to store a jpeg image, allowing you to keep shooting as they are being recorded onto the memory card, and there is virtually no lcd blackout between each image.
further appealing to the avid photographer in you, the ricoh gxr has a range of focusing and metering modes that should cover most situations.
the gxr is also  smaller than either a dslr or the recent micro four thirds cameras from  panasonic and olympus.
ricoh have created a truly innovative  modular system, where you swap both the lens and the image sensor at the same  time, not just the lens as with a conventional dslr camera.
it doesn't sound like a big deal in theory,  but in practice it really helps to make all those wide-angle shots perfectly  level.
this is a unique offering in the ricoh range, and is notably the first ever ricoh camera to feature the same-sized sensor that the majority of dslrs use.
returning to the camera body, there are four external controls which form  the creative heart of the gxr.
but there's enough common ground when either is fitted to merit a combined review.
the panasonic gf1 and olympus  e-p1 / e-p2 cameras all use the smaller four thirds sensor size, so in theory  the gxr with the a12 unit should deliver better image quality.
digital slr’s allow you to change the lens on the front of the camera - the gxr allows you to change the lens and the image sensor, which are combined into a single interchangeable unit.
compared to the direct competition, it's better than the panasonic gf1's viewfinder, but not quite as good as the olympus e-p2's.
the gxr is easily one of the most customisable compact cameras that we've ever reviewed.
compared to ricoh’s  popular range of compacts, the gxr is bigger and heavier, but not by too much.
with a traditional dslr,  changing the lens exposes the image sensor, with dust inevitably finding its  way onto it.
77.1 mm (d) with the s10 unit fitted, and weighing around 263g without a unit  fitted and 423g with the s10 (although still not including the the battery or  memory card).
it's physically bigger and brighter than the vf-1  model supplied with ricoh's compacts, making accurate manual focusing much  easier to judge.
instead of just taking an average reading from the whole scene, which  inevitably gets the white balance wrong for the secondary light source, the gxr  breaks the image down into small areas and analyzes and sets the white balance  for each one.
quite a lot of the camera's main options, such as image size, sharpness, metering mode and continuous mode, are accessed here, so the shooting settings menu has 23 options spread over 3 screens, the key custom options menu has 16 options, and the setup menu has 34 options.

you can also manually  over-ride the auto-focus system by using this focus ring.
ease of use the ricoh gxr is launching with two interchangeable camera units, the s10 /  24-72mm / 10 megapixel unit and the a12 / 50mm / 12 megapixel unit, both of  which were supplied to us by ricoh uk, along with the vf-2 external viewfinder  and the clever lc-2 self-retaining lenscap (which only fits the s10 unit).
if you don't like composing your photos by holding the camera at arms length and looking at the lcd screen, there's also another way of framing your shots.
the gxr is bigger and heavier than the gr digital iii, but not by  as much as you'd first imagine, and it's a little smaller and lighter than the  panasonic gf1, the previous holder of the "world's smallest and lightest  interchangeable lens camera" title.
utilising a magnesium alloy body, the gxr is an extremely well-built camera, continuing the long-established ricoh tradition of producing serious photographic tools.
this is perfectly  acceptable for its main use as a dedicated macro lens, but makes it less  suitable for street photographer where every second counts.
the navigation pad  on the rear offers fn1 and fn2 settings, both of which can be re-configured to  (by default they change the focus type and the manual flash amount) and  pressing up and down increases and decreases exposure compensation.
also  very useful is the ability to change the power of the built-in flash which can  be set at 12 levels from full flash to 1/64, enabling you to balance the  intensity for both the subject and background.
the choice of the 50mm macro lens is also interesting, in that a focal length of 50mm is useful for street photography as well as close-ups of flowers, providing an angle of view roughly equivalent to human vision, and the fast maximum aperture of f/2.5 is a real benefit for low-light shooting and creating that out-of-focus bokeh look.
the new flag function setting option allows you to choose up to 20 images that can then be quickly played back by selecting the flag function display option, useful for showing off key images.
most dslrs now employ some kind of built-in dust reduction / shake  system to try and automatically remove the dust from the sensor, although you  invariably need to clean it using a third-party solution or have it cleaned  periodically by the manufacturer.
for example, in manual mode, by default the up-down dial sets the aperture  and the adj. button sets the shutter speed, providing quick and intuitive  access.
that ultimately means  that some photographers are going to be left out, as ricoh obviously can't make  every combination available.
there are two such units available on launch - the s10, which features a 24-72mm zoom lens and 10 megapixel 1/1.7-inch ccd sensor, and the a12, which combines a 50mm macro lens and a 12.3 megapixel aps-c cmos sensor.
even better, the adj. menu is customisable - you can choose what the first four settings do, allowing you to control exactly what you want quick access to.
share your photos thanks to digital photo frames.
a new addition to the gxr is the direct button, positioned to the far left above the lcd screen.
further appealing  to the avid photographer in you, the ricoh gxr has a range of focusing and  metering modes that should cover most situations.
the 50mm unit is a little slower, with a distinct pause as it physically moves in and out before locking onto the subject, and it often failed to focus at all on low-contrast subjects.
if you're using the external viewfinder, or can't see the lcd screen in very bright sunlight, then the camera can also be set to make a sound to indicate a level horizon.
