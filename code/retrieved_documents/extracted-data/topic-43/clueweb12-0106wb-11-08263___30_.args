it offers a huge range of features that will make shooting quicker and easier for the experienced shooter, with lots of customizable options and quick control access.the d200 performed admirably at low iso settings, staying with the canon 5d in terms of noise, color, and dynamic range.the f/1.4 lenses are appropriate in low light, but for ideal image quality, they aren't nearly as good as nikon and canon's macro lenses.the slt-a55 is a well performing slr, with a wide iso range, good color and relatively low noise.in this mode the 5d produces images that match the output of the canon eos 1d mark ii and mark ii n, and the company suggests that photographers shooting with both a 1d mark ii and 5d can get matched color across bodies.in this mode the 5d produces images that match the output of the canon eos 1d mark ii and mark ii n, and the company suggests that photographers shooting with both a 1d mark ii and 5d can get matched color across bodies.the 5d also shows a slight drop in image quality, but still retains the quality characteristics that make the camera’s images desirable.the nikon noise reduction was more likely to make a visible difference in the image, but the result was still inferior to images shot at similar exposures with the 5d. the 5d's images started out less noisy and more detailed than the d200's – even with noise reduction, the d200 couldn't catch up.shots at higher iso settings with the 5d contain less noise and more detail, but also show much smoother tonal transitions, which result in far more depth in the images.standard boosts contrast and sharpens the image more than is kind in human portraiture.each shooting situation is unique, and a single portrait mode can't address the range of variables a photographer is likely to see.read full 7-part review$589.95 read full 7-part review the 18-megapixel canon 7d delivers high resolution stills and full hd video in a well-built camera designed for serious photographers without the desire (or budget) for a full-frame model.it’s interesting to note that the 5d performs in the same manner as most digital cameras, with stronger horizontal resolution, while the d200 by contrast exhibits greater resolution in the vertical direction with the standard 50mm lens wide open.on the other hand, many valid and interesting pictures have been taken backlit, or with light sources in the frame.both cameras were tested for saturation and color accuracy at each available iso setting using their most natural color modes.
