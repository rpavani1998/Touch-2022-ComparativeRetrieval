i did not like the lcd screen of the camera, i wish it had a screen protector like thenikon d90 or a fold away screen like the nikon d5000.
withthe  nikon d3100, i did worry about scratching the screen and was always cleaning it.
a new  photographer will not always know how to take care of their camera.

i have used it thoroughly, and had more fun with the  nikon d3100 than i thought i would.

must admit that i’m a beginner and i saw  in live both cameras and like nikon better only for it’s size (because  it’s smaller) but friend told me that canon t2i is better camera.
this camera was fantastic for photo walking.
my old canon powershot s3is has a fold away screen and that is one of the reasons i let my 3-year take photos with it.
i want to by my first slr camera, and i cannot choose beetwen nikon d3100 and canon t2i.
