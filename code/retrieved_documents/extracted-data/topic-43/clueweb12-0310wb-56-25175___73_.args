i have actually used this camera for portraits and weddings, and it is exceptionally easy to use and provides commercial quality results.excellent photos depend more on the lens and tripod, but this camera body is more than adequate as a basic building block of a real system.this is nothing against simple cameras and a simple kit, but more capable cameras and more varied kits allow you to take shots which work in a much wider variety of situations.i've rediscovered a very satisfying hobby and am taking better photos than i ever have, mainly because i am now able to afford all of the equipment i wanted but couldn't afford when i was a poor student.although this lens cuts corners with a plastic mount and lack of focusing scale, it's small, light, responsive, and decently sharp.i have fairly small hands and all of the controls fall readily under my fingers and the camera operates quickly and intuitively.if you own a canon and you take macro photographs, buy this lens, not only is it a great macro lens, but the 100mm focal length and f/2.8 maximum aperture makes it a great portrait lens as well.i know that the vast majority of people making a living with photography do what i do, but like the rest of you i hold out hope that i may capture some images that are salable to publishers as well.it increases the performance in portraits and adds very good balance to the camera when "l" lenses are used ...the camera is easy to use and figure out, canon's usm af technology is impressive, and the fill flash finally works pretty well for off center subjects.it gets every last drop of performance out of the eye controlled focus, the image stabilisation works as well if not better than canon says it does and the optics are a dream for a zoom lens at its price.but the 100mm focal length and f/2.8 maximum aperture makes it a great portrait lens as well.it's an inexpensive way to get an ultra-wide lens, which is normally quite costly.this is good, thoughtful ergonomic design and helps to make the camera easy to use.first of all, its layout and handling is exemplary, perhaps one of the best of any camera ever.
