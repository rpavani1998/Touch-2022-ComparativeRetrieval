the obvious advantages of digital include instant results, zero processing costs after the initial investment, on-the-fly adjustment of iso sensitivity ("film speed") and image type size, no scanning or developing,instant inspection, edit and delete, flash memory storage and transferability to the personal computer, and a potentially huge "roll of film" to hold many pictures without changing compactflash storage cards.though anybody can delight at the stunningly sharp, clear pictures, there are cameras on the market at less than half the price with great fixed optics, 4 to 6 megapixels, that are much easier to use and may even take more pleasingly balanced pictures in the hands of the average consumer.the ability to switch lenses, say from normal to telephoto, gives the slr much of its desired versatility.this is also true of many other machines that offer us at least the opportunity to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary.although no digital camera is ideal for deep-space photography, the slr camera body can be attached directly to the back of many astronomy telescopes with a cheap adapter.this camera is everything a serious amateur photographer could want in a digital camera, and, yes, you can take your lenses with you -- if you stay in the nikon slr family of cameras, into which the d100 has made a dramatic entry.ergonomics: as a full-size slr, the d100 is a hefty camera, particularly with a zoom lens, but the full wraparound grip, which also houses the battery pack, makes single-handed shooting easy (use two hands anyway, and use the camera strap!).it adds adventurous depth and clarity to the act of re-experiencing special moments and insights.the ability to replay it faithfully in every detail, as with good audio equipment, enhances the experience of re-creating the original.camera ccd's, designed for daylight usage, generate "noise" for night shots, i.e., very long time exposures in very low light conditions.if you aren't already a 35mm enthusiast, and don't like the jargon of f-stops, shutter speeds and iso ratings: the d100 is capable (like all digital cameras) of shooting fully automatic focus and exposure.with smaller telescopes, this is the ideal for terrestrial photography for extreme magnification, distance, or really bright, sharp close-ups.judging from the initial demand for this camera - it is still really hard to find at any price - there is a lot of pent-up demand within the nikon slr owner community for a move to digital without a compromise in quality.i've always suspected that kodak engineered some sophisticated color balance and image enhancement algorithms into its images, for these images rarely benefit from the standard photoshop feature set, as do nikon slide scans and even the nikon d100 images i've shot so far.reviewers have commented that jpg did not live up to its full potential with this camera, in their opinion due to very conservative engineering values for sharpening.
