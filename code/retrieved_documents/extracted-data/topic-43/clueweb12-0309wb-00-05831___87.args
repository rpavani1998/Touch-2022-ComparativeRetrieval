i hardly ever shoot raw.
but a manual-focus “feature” buried somewhere in the electronics is simply not in the same league as a focus ring on the lens that can be set with a flick of the finger even before the camera is powered up.
i do realize i could somehow improve my technique and 'learn' to work the d2, however, there was just this nagging disappointment in this otherwise gorgeous camera.
unfortunately, it removes a lot of fine detail as well.
these pictures show my personalized pair.
alas, it too is already showing signs of the metallic finish wearing through to a very unattractive white underneath.
didn’t like being limited to one or two focal lengths; didn’t like the parallax error; didn’t like the big lens protuding into the viewfinder corner; didn’t like the extra bulk on top.
so while others are shooting at f2.8 (with a 17mm) at iso 400 the leica shoots at iso 200, or as the article suggests iso 100 and pulled a couple of stops with the lens no longer at open aperture.
the bokeh is quite beautiful.
anthony brookes , september 30, 2004; 04:40 a.m. having looked at a number of cumbersome large digital cameras the prospect of having one near m6 size with more conventional controls is attractive.
this is probably as good a place as any to say that i did not buy the digilux 2 for the leica nameplate.
and in most cases, simply touching the shutter button will “clear” all menus/functions and take you directly back to shooting.
however, when you move from manual to af, the ring can easily be turned one more step to af-macro.
it is to say that this camera is not up to the standards that we have come to expect of that great company.
i found an intersection where a building blocked my view of oncoming cross-traffic, so that i couldn’t anticipate when a car would enter the scene.
filters: a big blunder is offering a sophisticated and costly lens with bizarre 69mm filter threads and not even offer filters for sale at the time of the camera's introduction.
but with its squared-off ends and large (69mm diameter) lens - it reminds me more of a canon 7 wearing the legendary 50mm f/0.95, or perhaps a nikon sp with a nikkor 50 f/1.1 mounted, especially if the nikkor and the vario-summicron have their massive lens shades attached.
the most basic shows you nothing but the image and the af ‘box’ - until you touch the shutter button, at which point the aperture and shutter speed appear, along with a “match-needle” scale if you’re setting exposure manually.
due to the meter’s habit of protecting the highlights, changing the contrast when using autoexposure has the effect of lightening or darkening the shadows - moving only the left end of the histogram.
i simply find that i am becoming more interested in creating wider angled images and therefore want to explore beyond the field of view provided with a 28mm lens.
in the image above, the bottom row shows straight exposures at iso 100/200/400.
the program mode can be biased towards either fast shutter speeds/large apertures or slow shutter speeds/small apertures by thumbing the serrated silver wheel on the camera back.
i love the 4:3 format and despite the modest 5 mp resolution, no one has complained about the file size since the quality of the lens and the spectacular quality of its jpeg rendition.
in high continuous shooting mode, you subject will ask if you have taken the picture yet while you've already grabbed a dozen shots (read that somewhere).
compared to a dslr the d2 is smaller, lighter, much quieter, more discrete, less attention getting.
the d2 lens is worth a fortune in equivalent leica m glass.
darker skin tones are rendered in browns instead of purples.
these modes are set via the aperture ring and shutter dial.
press the button again, and the base pops up another 60 degrees, pointing the flash at the subject.
better than a videophone broadcast from baghdad.
i could wish for an 8mp sensor to capture more of the lens’s abilities.
the d2 is larger than camera a (your pick of p&s's), the ccd is smaller than camera b (dslr's), the megapixels are fewer than camera c (current crop of 8mp digicams), the evf is inferior to camera d (minolta a2).
like other tools, it is appropriate to use the d2 in situations where it's strengths will be apparent.
that does not mean i won't buy this camera (wife's approval pending).
since the true focal-length range is 7mm-22.5mm, depth of field is extensive.
in the meantime for my travel, family, street shooting the d2 is a much welcome relief from a dslr and big bag of lenses.
i discredit reviewers that negatively latch onto one or another feature and declare the camera a failure because of it.
if leica sees fit to change the firmware and make the jpeg noise-reduction “user-adjustable” - or if one works from raw originals - better results may be possible.
this camera fills a gap for me, and should be a good carry around camera for general use.
but i am tired of holding cameras that feel like a plastic toy.
another reason why i shoot more or less everything on 120/220 film - there is no digital camera (yet) available which can beat roll film performance.
caucasian skin tones in sunset light tend towards golden, not ruddy.
a (your pick of p&s's), the ccd is smaller than camera b (dslr's), the megapixels are fewer than camera c (current crop of 8mp digicams), the evf is inferior to camera d (minolta a2).
of course, sound has to be turned off.
it’s still ugly - especially when sitting on the sofa and “fondling” the little beast.
the actual blue channel looks like a kodalith image of out-of-focus oatmeal - no fine details, no tonality.
in my opinion this camera will probably not do well for the leica legend of excellence.
whilst the camera has many other impressive qualities, it is this first major drawback which compels me to hang on to my money.
it just plain fits into my life much more compatibly than any dslr.
to many photographers owning a leica is worth the price.
i hope to use the panasonic to do test shots to support the big fujis, and i should be able to do less bracketing after going through a learning curve.
however, there is an innate charm to the lc1 (or digilux 2), with all the manual or auto controls you need in 3 rings around the lens, and the build quality is the most refined in any digital camera i have seen (dslrs included).
- bottomline was that i was perhaps happy with just 5% of the results, which is not what i would expect from such an expensive camera.
if you have a good name, you've got to keep it good.
still, it has a great memory buffer and basically no lag time, even in raw mode.
the technical theorising concerned the speed and range of the lens, i.e. f/2 was faster than any other digicam offering and i was happy that the 28-90mm could provide a general purpose range for what might be termed as a 'normalised' field of view.
it will be interesting when the epson ships with a real optical viewfinder and leica lens mount compatibility.
since my “push-processed” images from iso 100 to 400 worked pretty well, i also experimented with underexposing and “pushing” iso 400 images to higher eis.
to quote leica again: "sales of the leica compact cameras, among them the digital leica digilux 2 model, grew by 40.2 % to euros 13.7 million.
read on... guide to nikon ttl flashes cliff mautner wedding photography workshop expecting the unexpected latest equipment articles incase ari marcopoulos camera bag review back when i was in my late teens/early 20's and breaking into the "extreme sports" photograph world, i first set my sights on being a snowboard photographer.
since it is all digital anyways they should be able to have digitally projected infinatly variable frame lines, and a digital range finder "cam" system to go with the zoom.
and when i factor in the accessories and glass that i've accumulated, the nikon is no cheaper than the leica.
that’s 60 rolls of film - or $660 in film/processing costs.
i've been the second brazillian to get a digilux 2 in the authorized leica dealer.
no other digicam has a lens this valuable and leica is renown for premium quality premium priced optics.
works very well except if subject is too close to fall under the bounced light.
otherwise, once the light drops below what f/2 and iso 400 can handle, it’s time for an f/1.4 lens - on an slr with a bigger chip and less noise reduction, or a film rangefinder.
gives 28mm-80mm equivalent 3.5-5.6 (slow..but per above, so what?), and it works really well despite being.. er cheap.
unless the camera comes equipped with user- or factory-upgradable sensors (now there's an idea), i am not sure if i would be willing to pay through the nose for such a "durable" camera.
i use three fuji medium format manual cameras, and i hope this digital will be a perfect companion to them.
the lens is very sharp, has crisp edge definition, and does a superb job of separating and defining colors and tones.
had it been a panasonic i would have paid a substantial sum for a re-do which would not have been covered by insurance.
it’s also possible to resize and crop images, set up dpof info for requesting prints from a mini-lab, play slide shows and video, and some other stuff - none of which i use.
i wouldn’t swear to any part of the body being metal, although some controls probably are.
: total time to turn on the camera, turn on “manual focus” and set 6 feet on the lcd readout - 5 seconds on the g5: total time to turn on the camera, turn on “manual focus” and set 6 feet on the lcd’s “thermometer” focus scale - 6-7 seconds not to pick on the canon and sony, which do pretty well as digicams go.
however, i found the camera incredibly easy to work with, and the photos were clearly better than any i've ever taken with my nikon.
the iso 100 image quality is extremely good - challenging the results from film scans with twice as many pixels due to the lens’s outstanding resolution.
jpeg files are actually monochrome rgbs, not grayscale.
even at iso 400 the b&w .jpg's look quite good and seem to me to have less noise than color .jpg's.
at iso 100 the images are very smooth and clean - not quite as sharp as velvia, but a good match for the average 35mm 100 slide film.
well, this was my first experience with leica and not a very memorable one at that.
" leica suffered a 35% decline in income from sales of its interchangeable-lens ("system") 35mm film cameras, i.e. the m and r lines.
the iq quality is very close to the film, also the operation is good, few weakness, but as old says "if i can live with it".
anybody who tells you that their dslr takes better photos than the leica/panasonic has never compared the results.
the lcd gives me the opportunity to see the picture before it is taken and that is something marvellous.
so you might save by buying cheap in the first place, but will end up paying for it in the end!
i bought the d2 in april and it paid for itself (2 times over) the first job i used it on.
looks great on the bluish lcd when reviewing pictures, but too yellow once the pictures are loaded into photoshop.
personally, i love wide (my main film lens is a 21mm) - so i found this a pleasant surprise.
the focal lengths are accurate if you crop the digilux’s 4:3 “ideal” format to the shape of a 35mm frame.
i discredit reviewers that negatively latch onto one or another feature and declare the camera a failure because of it.
but i found that while not great it really wasn't that bad.
leica followed this design in all later models and although modern lenses could not be collapsed, the design reminded functional and the styling great.
leica will not sell many.
the most startling thing about digital color is that, properly white balanced, it is remarkably clean and free from color casts compared to chemical imaging/scanning.
it does slightly reduce the stretching of faces and heads into football shapes (american football - rugby-ball elsewhere) near the corners, so it’s a mild plus in “people” pictures.)
this means that if you shoot as soon as you see the green dot, you may be shooting an unfocused picture.
that said, in my opinion the d2 has been of great value to me.
i had seen examples of this before i bought the camera, but the vast majority of images posted, whether on the forums or on website reviews, were shot with the ccd exposure rated at 100 iso, so i incorrectly assumed that the f/2 lens overcame the need for such a frequent use of higher iso rates.
leica m's don't compete on price alone.
i also compared the images and musings visible on the forums for the various 8 megapixel offerings, such as the minolta a2, the olympus c-8080 and the canon powershot pro1.
i own and believe i know how to use autofocus cameras.
the camera is still much happier with full-spectrum light (daylight, flash or blue photofloods).
at iso 100 the images are very smooth and clean - not quite as sharp as velvia, but a good match for the average 35mm 100 slide film.
and does lots photos for commercial work, like print out on the large wall...
unless the camera comes equipped with user- or factory-upgradable sensors (now there's an idea), i am not sure if i would be willing to pay through the nose for such a "durable" camera.
the big-light-high definition-etc lcd screen.
comparing a “b&w” shot of a gretag colorchecker to a color image converted via the channel-mixer, the camera’s internal channel-mix is roughly red 35%/green 55%/blue 10%.
"making junk and hoping the good name will obfuscate that its junk just doesn't work in the technology world.
the iso 400 images are the best in its size class.
300 pounds difference between the two...iam familiar with the 1 and think that it takes good shots at 100asa...
no pc outlet - you’d need some kind of adapter (radio, slave) for work with studio strobes.
i could wish for an alternative to the video viewfinder, so long as it retained the manual focusing, silence, and accurate framing.
focus/zoom feel - not as silky smooth as i'd like and a little lightwieght for my taste.
i would have been better off with a $50 p&s camera in those cases.
the traffic was moving at 20 mph (i drove the street 3 times to check this) - which is 30 feet per second.
as an operating tool in the hand, the digilux 2 is almost exactly what i wanted in a digital camera.
the leica digilux 2 - a review most popular lenses popular articles nikon j1 review photo.net nikon editor shun cheung reviews the new nikon j1 camera system.
sort of like a parent calling the kid at college and saying "we aren't sending another check until you tell us how you spent the last one."
in which case there is simply a viewfinder black-out of 1 second while the camera starts to save the image.
the leica m6s live on b&w and the once-a-year roll of 400 color - the digilux gets the rest.
i did my best to really like this camera and even thought of holding on to it, but in the very end i just could not convince myself to keep the camera.
blue lights bloom excessively in night exposures (see section below on night/time exposures) let’s make it simple.
if you change the colour-management than you change automatically other settings or if you reduce the noise it could be that the images will not have the typical leica sharpness.
i’ve discovered that: 1) 4x really isn’t enough enlargement for most critical focusing, and 2) holding the shutter button down lightly will turn off the magnification temporarily to allow a quick check of overall framing anyway (a nice “undocumented” feature).
they'd sell a zillion d3s at 3x canon's price if they just managed to equal canon g6.
maybe some of the details of the film image are not visible on the web, but overall, having seen these comparison photos, i am asking myself why spending thousands of dollars for the leica m6 lenses if that digital camera can do it almost better.
i fell over with my digilux 2 (composing a shot, missed a step but got the shot in the end).
all of which gets you to the important thing - pushing the shutter release - in the shortest time possible.
this has great benefits for right-eyed photographers: you don’t have to balance the camera on the tip of your nose (firmer support), people can see your face while you’re shooting (a good way to establish and maintain trust), and, in the case of the digilux, you aren’t constantly planting nose-grease on the rear lcd.
like other tools, it is appropriate to use the d2 in situations where it's strengths will be apparent.
i love it and it really changed my way of photographing.
the analog controls, with each control handling one function, are very fast and very transparent.
the viewfinder is electronic - a tv set behind an eyepiece.
don't know if it's the best that technology permits to be done, but is the best compared to any digital camera.
i would rather spend $600 on a used canon eos d60 (which, from what i've just read and seen, outperforms this camera by a mile) and then spend the difference in price choosing from the vast array of fantastic eos lenses available.
this, of course, is due to handheld photography and varying light conditions; however, when i have taken similar photos with a 35mm contax slr with 100 speed film, almost all photos were tack sharp.
they all have a mechanical feel - though most obviously connect to electronics beneath the surface.
in the image above, the bottom row shows straight exposures at iso 100/200/400.
i would mention, somewhat randomly, these verbose opinions: aethetics: the d2 is in my humble opinion the best looking camera ever.
since my “push-processed” images from iso 100 to 400 worked pretty well, i also experimented with underexposing and “pushing” iso 400 images to higher eis.
my shoulder loves it - my hands might wish for an ounce or two more heft at slow shutter speeds.
i don't exactly see folks standing in line to buy the company, and there's a reason for that..soon it might be much, much cheaper to buy leica.. juan monino , may 23, 2005; 02:08 p.m.
great dof is good for some situation but it cripples the camera for others, when one needs bokeh and the 3d effects it creates.
my criteria for aesthetic concerns, were won over by the colour rendition that i could see in the images i had seen.
auto, sunny, cloudy, tungsten, electronic flash, manual - and black-and-white.
the lens is a non-interchangeable 7mm-22.5mm f/2.0-2.4 vario-summicron zoom, equivalent to a 28mm-90mm zoom for 35mm film.
as a long time user of the leica m system, i knew going in that any leica camera would carry a premium price.
tri-x film, introduced 50 years ago in1954, has a grain size that is much more prominent than chromagenic films yet plenty of people like it and use it and refrain from bashing the grain level as unacceptable.
i wouldn’t swear to any part of the body being metal, although some controls probably are.
for motion and action shots, the jpeg high works rather well, and the pictures always retain that illusive and hard-to-explain leica quality.
finally, you can add a live histogram (brightness only, not colors) to the “las vegas” view.
i've read the review twice now and can't imagine why anyone who doesn't have money to burn would by such a hunk of junk.
banks withold credit for a reason, and leica's ability to manage itself financially have a poor track record.
i won’t go into all the possible menus that can be brought up on the screens - every possible control from setting the internal clock/calendar to choosing how many prints to order.
less grain than most 400 color negs i’ve scanned, a bit worse than provia 400f, especially in the shadows.
i weep trying to scan my few "legacy" color slides.
i would rather spend $600 on a used canon eos d60 (which, from what i've just read and seen, outperforms this camera by a mile) and then spend the difference in price choosing from the vast array of fantastic eos lenses available.
for me the major issues are quality in the optics rather than post-process correction and the simplicity/user-friendliness of the tool.
but a digilux raw file is 9.6 megabytes, so it fills that memory with one picture, requiring a pause after every exposure.
i have the same feeling with the digilux 2, but in a better way.
sharpness is a tiny bit lower, and the overall feel of grainless highlights and a touch of grain/noise in the shadows comes closest to chromogenic b&w films such as ilford xp2.
(pause while the “expose to the right” fans stop choking and get their hearts started again).
i didn't use any nd filters, use the raw to save lots detail back from the sky and the shadow, the raw was very good at the time, but the raw is better now in any cameras, but still good enough, i can live with it and happy.
the digital zoom is okay for amateur use and can be used on some rare occassions.
it is much easier to visualize real-time b&w on the lcd screen compared to the dslr's always-in-color viewfinder.
i decided upon the lc1 largely from reading the personal experiences of people on the dpreview forums and seeing the images that they displayed.
as i started to use it, i got really impressed with some attributes and disapointed with others.
using photoshop you can increase resolution to 5120x3852 pixels with minor losses.
another 2-3 months of shooting, and i’ll be able to slap a “don’t laugh -
image quality depends from the adjustments (colour, contrast, noise, sharpness).
i could obtain noise free images from exposures recorded by the ccd at iso 100, but everything else displayed a level of grain that i did not wish to see and more to the point, was something that i never learned to accept.
making junk and hoping the good name will obfuscate that its junk just doesn't work in the technology world.
btw my german is fluent, i read the company's financial report as well...
with its centered lens, it is easier to hold, and much easier to hold steady, than the “l” shape used for most other top-end digicams, because the left palm has a corner to provide mutual support, instead of thin air.
it doesn't have a usable iso 1600 or available iso 6400 setting.
there's a sucker born every minute, not to mention two con men ready to take advantage of him.
i did use the camera extensively for the 2 weeks so here are my comments / observations: - the design is beautiful and the camera just has a unique style to it - exposures for the most part were fine, 90% of the time as i would want them to be although some results were very disappointing - focus was the most disappointing for me, since of the more than 200 or 300 photos i took, about 75% were not focussed.
reading a review that points both sides is a real pleasure.
that’s 60 rolls of film - or $660 in film/processing costs.
under lighting short in blue wavelengths - tungsten, fluorescent, sodium vapor - even when “white-balanced”, the blue channel develops large blobby noise, which shows up as an “underpainting” of yellow patches at all isos, but especially 400.
just served for picture identification while in play mode and framing when shooting.
the upper images were shot with the camera set to iso 100 but underexposed 1 and 2 stops and lightened in photoshop.
strong points full set of manual/analog photographic controls - even the “auto” settings are via dials, rings and levers.
the wonky blue channel shows its stuff.
to quote leica again: "sales of the leica compact cameras, among them the digital leica digilux 2 model, grew by 40.2 % to euros 13.7 million.
on a trip, who want to carry a big backpack with a bunch of equipment (dslr and 2.8 lenses along with tripod that will support them both).
before i bought the d70, i borrowed a coworker's panasonic lc1 for some quick photos i needed.
i don’t see much noise beyond the normal amounts for iso 100 or 400 in an 8-second exposure - perhaps 50 specks out of 5 million pixels that might be under- or over-corrected hot pixels.
the program mode can be biased towards either fast shutter speeds/large apertures or slow shutter speeds/small apertures by thumbing the serrated silver wheel on the camera back.
you can get close to medium format results with stitching software.
the d2 is not that much lighter, it is not that much smaller, and though the lens is fast, a camera like the 10d can gain 2-3 stops simply by having useable iso 200, 400, 800, and sometimes 1600.. or 3200 in a pinch.
john falkenstine , march 07, 2005; 12:52 a.m. my june 6 2004 observation was correct "leica ist kaputt" now going into receivership as credit has been withdrawn from the company.
under lighting short in blue wavelengths - tungsten, fluorescent, sodium vapor - even when “white-balanced”, the blue channel develops large blobby noise, which shows up as an “underpainting” of yellow patches at all isos, but especially 400.
all of the “photographic” controls (exposure, focus, focal length, metering pattern, etc.) are analog dials, rings and levers.
i wanted a digital camera that could do better than the 2700-ppi scans i was getting from iso 100/160 color negative films.
when using manual focus, the viewfinder can be set to magnify the center of the image when the focus ring is touched.
i do like being able to compose in b&w mode and still shoot colour raw though.
evergreen trees are green, not brown or gray.
p.m. i find the most interesting part of the review is the fact that there is a tutorial on how to take acceptable iso 400 images (that circumvent the in-built shortcomings) with a 1300 uk pound camera.
graham welland , june 07, 2004; 04:55 a.m. thanks for a balanced review that actually gave me some valuable user advice (iso 400 shooting technique).
again, the logic of the analog controls comes into play.
this business of dogging the d2 for its weaknesses is akin to saying that my deardorff 8x10 is no good because it cannot be hand-held, or that a hasselblad is no good because its lenses aren't as fast as a 35mm or dslr.
(having an f/2 aperture helps, of course).
so while others are shooting at f2.8 (with a 17mm) at iso 400 the leica shoots at iso 200, or as the article suggests iso 100 and pulled a couple of stops with the lens no longer at open aperture.
1) testing color rendition with the colorchecker, most colors are rendered quite well, but blues - especially dark “nylon sportswear” blues - and to a lesser extent, yellows, tend to hypersaturate.
it can't shoot real macro, or sports or vr zooms or 300mm f2.8 teles.
sharpness is a tiny bit lower, and the overall feel of grainless highlights and a touch of grain/noise in the shadows comes closest to chromogenic b&w films such as ilford xp2.
but a digilux raw file is 9.6 megabytes, so it fills that memory with one picture, requiring a pause after every exposure.
strong points weak points additional functions that i don’t use, but may be of interest: video with sound at 10 or 30 fps, 320 x 240 resolution, about 8 minutes worth per 256 mb of memory at 30 fps; stop-animation, (a series of “still” pictures that end up as a video file, for claymation™-type animations); sound recording that can be appended to still pictures (news photographers could use this to have subjects spell their names, i guess); dpof settings for ordering prints from a digital minilab; down-sampling and/or cropping of pictures in the camera; showing pictures as a timed ‘slide show’ on the lcd or a tv (camera comes with an a/v outlet and mini-plug/rca cord); remote control from a computer via usb connection; direct printing to a usb-direct-print-compatible (whew!) printer.
about on the level of the quietest leaf shutters, at most.
sort of like a parent calling the kid at college and saying "we aren't sending another check until you tell us how you spent the last one."
this greatly reduces post-processing & tweaking.
i hope to use the panasonic to do test shots to support the big fujis, and i should be able to do less bracketing after going through a learning curve.
the camera also has a standard hot-shoe, with dedicated contacts for use with leica/metz flashes.
tungsten does ok, but undercorrects a bit, leaving some residual yellow under house lights.
on the other hand, the digilux 2’s jpeg images are somewhat “brittle”.
the camera can be set to magnify the center of the image 4x or 8x for manual focus (the magnification turns on when the focus ring is touched, and turns off a couple of seconds later), but even using this focus-assist, focusing at “28mm” is still troublesome.
i don't like menus and not in your face composition of viewscreens or bulk of the high quality systems.
and i will still have the analog controls, comfortable ergonomics, and really impressive leica lens to keep using forever - or what passes for “forever” in the world of digital photography.
i've read the review twice now and can't imagine why anyone who doesn't have money to burn would by such a hunk of junk.
however, when you move from manual to af, the ring can easily be turned one more step to af-macro.
by making massive repetitive errors like this, leica shows some classic business mis-steps that could lead to its demise.
my shoulder loves it - my hands might wish for an ounce or two more heft at slow shutter speeds.
i own these lenses and when i need them i happily pull out my dslr.
it helped me a lot in my decision process, buying my digital camera.
i hate testing; thanks for doing so for the community.
at 100 the digilux is a bit ahead of “traditional” iso 100/125 silver films in terms of grain/noise, but not tmax/delta or iso 50 film.
and water reflecting sky, or sky-lit shadows/shade, are rendered as cyan-blue, not purple-blue.
leica m's don't compete on price alone.
however, i found the camera incredibly easy to work with, and the photos were clearly better than any i've ever taken with my nikon.
the electronic viewfinder despite the digilux 2’s vague resemblance to a classic rangefinder camera, it is not a rangefinder.
autofocus is fairly good and fast, but in low light situations, the camera often is unable to focus at all, forcing me to switch to manual mode, and often causing me to miss shots entirely.
the digilux 2 has a built-in pop-up flash.
i wasn't familiar with his camera at all, and wasn't aware of its pedigree.
it strips away magenta casts from sky and clouds.
the ccd dislocated itself and the camera had to go back for a new one.
in manual mode you set both the shutter and aperture yourself, using the internal meter readout’s “needle” as a guide, or using a hand-held meter, or even just using the old “sunny-16” rule-of-thumb.
the premium demanded by leica was not earned in one day.
well, this was my first experience with leica and not a very memorable one at that.
there is now a new version with interchangeable lenses or the new m8, beyond my range today but if i hadn't bought the d200 i would be an m8 sort of guy, so there, bugger me but leica is good.
but in this view, touching the shutter does turn on a “live” scale and readouts for manual metering that stay on for 10 seconds, or as long as you keep moving the aperture/shutter controls.

here is an admittedly unfair comparison of noise results, but i think that they are interesting representations, and anyway i currently have no other more relevant images stored here at photo.net: panasonic lc1 @ iso 100 nikon d70 @ iso 1600 peter robert schellhammer , december 06, 2004; 08:00
however, digital of any kind is not my cup of tea and despite what some other people say regarding the availibility of processing outlets and photoshop, i just don't like the process.
it does slightly reduce the stretching of faces and heads into football shapes (american football - rugby-ball elsewhere) near the corners, so it’s a mild plus in “people” pictures.)
once they resolve the snaggles of bad high iso in-camera jpegs and the truly, truly sad unacceptable spec of a 1 frame raw burst rate...
viewfinder: the evf is easily the d2's weakest feature.
for travel, personal, street shooting it is the perfect range and speed.
otherwise, once the light drops below what f/2 and iso 400 can handle, it’s time for an f/1.4 lens - on an slr with a bigger chip and less noise reduction, or a film rangefinder.
a red dot for "no focus" would have been a better warning than a flashing green dot, which can look like a "good focus" indicator for the first .5 second.
set the aperture to “a” and the camera will choose the aperture as you choose the shutter speed.
a bit like early cars, which looked like horse carriages.
in addition to the 3.2x mechanical zoom range, the digilux 2 offers a 2x/3x “digital” zoom which transforms the lens into a “56-180mm” or “85-270mm”.
i've probably taken about 1200 shots with it so far, and find that's it's pretty easy to use once you get acclimated to its setup.
one can buy a sigma 20mm f1.8 which gives about 30mm but it's massive and it's a sigma.
in leica's words (3-q report march 1, 2005): "these reductions of credit lines do not as yet endanger the company?s solvency.
the digilux has been out over a year, with no replacement on the horizon - hardly a "short life" in the digital world (where, for example, leica's partner panasonic went from the fz1 through the fz10 to the fz20 in a year).
“sunny” is generally too blue (especially here in denver, where there is a lot of extra uv light at a mile high).
but i certainly appreciate the thoroughness of andy's evaluation.
on the other hand, the biggest positive i take away is that i find myself taking more pictures again.
the money i saved will go towards a leica mp body.
at which point the digilux will be the same price as any other well-used digital camera - free.
not to pick on the canon and sony, which do pretty well as digicams go.
compared to a dslr the d2 is smaller, lighter, much quieter, more discrete, less attention getting.
despite the long time needed to save raw files, when shooting fine jpegs, the lag between exposures is 1 to 1.5 seconds, about the same as thumb-winding a film camera.
well, first i must admit, i did not read all comments before i started writing mine.
i would not give up any of its attributes to obtain a bigger ccd and modest image quality gain.
the rear finder is almost as large as a 645 film frame, but is not hinged for low/high-angle shots.
despite the long time needed to save raw files, when shooting fine jpegs, the lag between exposures is 1 to 1.5 seconds, about the same as thumb-winding a film camera.
the manual controls, quick start-up, and short shutter lag simply outperform anything less than an slr (and even a few of those) when it comes to fast work on the street, or wherever the action is.
as i got used to it, the thing that got me really in love with it was the lcd screen.
taking into account the average digital slr (or the epson rangefinder) magnification of 1.6 one needs a 17.5mm f2 err, which doesn't exist so for the wide angle digital user this camera is unique.
(btw, in the film/digital comparisons here, the digilux 2 images were upsampled about 40% to match image size with the film scans.
altho it has more versatility.
btw my german is fluent, i read the company's financial report as well...
in manual mode you set both the shutter and aperture yourself, using the internal meter readout’s “needle” as a guide, or using a hand-held meter, or even just using the old “sunny-16” rule-of-thumb.
for me this review was especially interesting, since it came out at the same time as i posted my panasonic lumix dmc-lc1 for sale on ebay, which is in turn about five months after i originally purchased it.
normally i am wary of new products but yours is the second review i have read which suggests the digilux 2 is well worth looking at.
i bought the d2 in april and it paid for itself (2 times over) the first job i used it on.
i do not have a lot of time to sit at a computer and use programs like photo shop (i lack the computer skills anyway.)being that i travel quite a bit in my work.
so when you get right down to it, it's a $600 sony 717 with a $1200 leica price sticker added and without the innovative features like laser af assist and nightshot.
autofocus is fairly good and fast, but in low light situations, the camera often is unable to focus at all, forcing me to switch to manual mode, and often causing me to miss shots entirely.
the size of the focus area has two settings - a “spot” area smaller than 1% of the image, and a larger “box” about 1/5th the height and width of the screen.
i have read all the reports as to what the leicas can and can't do and my position today is that they give me a sense of
it’s the best choice under non-daylight light sources, but needs to have a lot of blue compensation dialed in if the light is short on blue wavelengths (see blue-channel issues below).
sounds just like rfdr vs slr debates for film cameras.
but to use them you must also put up with a loud “beep” that plays when the af locks, and every time you press a button on the back: choosing from menus, setting functions, scrolling through pictures, deleting pictures, confirming deletes, switching viewfinders.
correct autofocus is indicated by a green dot that lights up in the viewfinder.
and when the final pictures are this clear and detailed, the fact that the viewfinder image is grainy becomes a minor issue.
a raw workflow is like the zone system - a brilliant tool for some kinds of photography, just not mine.
the d2, on the 50th anniversary of the m3, is a similar breakthrough in the way serious photographers interact with their digital cameras.
one of the reasons i bought a digital camera with fixed lens in place of and dslr (i used a great canon a-1 that belonged to my father since 1979 and was given to me in 2000 and my first idea when moving to digital was getting a dslr, probably rebel or d70)is because i can't stand the idea of having to clean the sensor once a year or so.
another reason why i shoot more or less everything on 120/220 film - there is no digital camera (yet) available which can beat roll film performance.
shooting at ei 100, manually white balancing, adjusting the white balance as far to the blue side as possible, and being generous with exposure (+1 ev) will boost the blue exposure to a reasonable level - pictures still need some photoshop work to fix color balance and saturation, but at least the blue channel contains detail.
if leica sees fit to change the firmware and make the jpeg noise-reduction “user-adjustable” - or if one works from raw originals - better results may be possible.
i fell over with my digilux 2 (composing a shot, missed a step but got the shot in the end).
and they really don't make things like this camera anymore.
one very smart feature is that the viewfinder of choice can be set separately for shooting or reviewing pictures.
not as good as a dslr: the d2 has more noise than a larger format dslr.
the d2, on the 50th anniversary of the m3, is a similar breakthrough in the way serious photographers interact with their digital cameras.
i am not a techy so decided not to dismantle but sent it to germany where after 2 goes thay got it right.
but in this view, touching the shutter does turn on a “live” scale and readouts for manual metering that stay on for 10 seconds, or as long as you keep moving the aperture/shutter controls.
the dark-frame exposure is not user-adjustable, and kicks in at 1/2 second - which snuck up on me a couple of times when i was making hand-held 1/2-sec.
as i got used to it, the thing that got me really in love with it was the lcd screen.
i could wish for an alternative to the video viewfinder, so long as it retained the manual focusing, silence, and accurate framing.
and it mostly affects the lighter tones, whereas the strongest noise is in the shadows.
flash the digilux 2 has a built-in pop-up flash.
it doesn't have a usable iso 1600 or available iso 6400 setting.
then i lighten the resulting dark images in photoshop (after converting to 16/48-bits and upsampling to avoid posterizing/combing the histogram as much as possible) using curves and levels.
if its resale value holds up when the inevitable 10mp version arrives then the initial cost of the d2 may be acceptable.
if the d2 had an aps sized sensor then the lens would be either impossibly huge or worse - limited in focal length and/or aperture.
the control wheel on the back was very slippery and hard to turn with gloves, but fortunately most of its functions can be handled by the 4-way button inside it, which worked fine.
pointing the camera at something dark and trying again cleared the problem each time.
after all, i'm getting a leica-designed vario-summicron that covers the fields of view of a 28mm, 35mm, 50mm, 75mm and 90mm, plus a camera that produces magical image files in both jpg and raw formats, for less than the price of a current m6 or m7 body (or most single lenses for the m system).
i have found that the only way i can get acceptable photos is by shooting in the 'm' manual mode, setting all controls myself.
that does not mean i won't buy this camera (wife's approval pending).
of course it isn't perfect and even doesn't work well in all conditions.
tri-x film, introduced 50 years ago in1954, has a grain size that is much more prominent than chromagenic films yet plenty of people like it and use it and refrain from bashing the grain level as unacceptable.
however, there is an innate charm to the lc1 (or digilux 2), with all the manual or auto controls you need in 3 rings around the lens, and the build quality is the most refined in any digital camera i have seen (dslrs included).
i know that 5mp is less that the lenses "deserve" but raw mode makes this a minor problem.
as i started to use it, i got really impressed with some attributes and disapointed with others.
evergreen trees are green, not brown or gray.
being used to the a-1, the digilux 2 manual operations made the decision easy, even with the high price compared to other cameras.
still, it has a great memory buffer and basically no lag time, even in raw mode.
we tried to get a perfect colour management, sharpness and contrast but it is impossible to avoid completely noise....
i shoot mostly architecture and have been quite happy stitching together several images when i need either more resolution or wider perspective.
i don't hear much bashing of 35mm image quality compared to 6x6 or 4x5 formats because everyone recognizes that different film format sizes have different trade-offs.
it changes drastically the approach to photography, the way the photographer interacts with the subject and widens the possibilities a lot.
if i weren’t primarily an iso 100 photographer, and willing to use creative workarounds on the few occasions i need 400, i would not be nearly so happy.
second: in really bright light the camera stops down the aperture to help control screen brightness.
the focusing ring is slightly “light” in touch, but allows one-finger focusing.
clearly less “grainy” noise than scans from color negs.
i use both dslrs, the d2 and film cameras (35mm, medium format and large format) in my business.
other than its twin (panosonci lc1) the d2 is the only digital camera i'm aware of that allows the photographer to set all the shooting controls (aperture, zoom, focus, shutter speed, etc.) without powering on and entering various levels of level.
it’s also possible to resize and crop images, set up dpof info for requesting prints from a mini-lab, play slide shows and video, and some other stuff - none of which i use.
blue lights bloom excessively in night exposures (see section below on night/time exposures) overall image quality let’s make it simple.
using photoshop you can increase resolution to 5120x3852 pixels with minor losses.
i would have liked custom settings as in some other digicams where i would combine b&w/raw/iso400 as well as a-color/jpg/iso100, etc.
the evf combines rangefinder quiet and smoothness with slr-like framing, focus range, and zoom capability - at the cost of an unpleasant view and slow (if eventually accurate) visual focusing.
the rear finder is almost as large as a 645 film frame, but is not hinged for low/high-angle shots.
the camera also has a standard hot-shoe, with dedicated contacts for use with leica/metz flashes.
i did my best to really like this camera and even thought of holding on to it, but in the very end i just could not convince myself to keep the camera.
but i was surprised how good that camera performs regarding image quality compared to the leica m6 with the 1,4/35mm lens.
before i bought the d70, i borrowed a coworker's panasonic lc1 for some quick photos i needed.
the focal lengths are accurate if you crop the digilux’s 4:3 “ideal” format to the shape of a 35mm frame.
great for previewing image while analyzing the histogram.
the on/off switch on the panasonic lc1 verson of the d2 is more ergonomic as it lies closer to the thumb than the d2 plus pushing the lever up for on and down for off makes more sense.
i intend to keep the nikon around for telephoto and macro work.
in april 2005 i sold my venice beach house and took off looking for zane grey's america, i had all my digital video cameras but wanted a reasonable digital still camera with a good lens, singular, didn't want digital and dust, so bought the digilux 2 from samy's in venice.
the only redeeming factor i can see in this overpriced, outperformed dinosaur is its lens, which appears to be fabulous (as are all leica lenses).
there are few industries as heart-wrenching as the fine art business.
as a photojournalist, i’d prefer “sharp and noisy” to “blurry and noiseless”.
another 2-3 months of shooting, and i’ll be able to slap a “don’t laugh -
i am considering pairing up the d2 with a 4mp panasonic dmc-fz10's leica designed 35-420mm (equiv) f2.8 - what a light weight killer combo that would be... cost: i don't complain about the premium cost of the d2 compared to the other digicams because i don't think any other digicam is comparable.
dan john falkenstine , june 06, 2004; 03:13 p.m. the camera reminds me strongly of english cars of years gone by...rationalization is required to oversee the fact that its an overpriced, outdated dud.
as with most rangefinder cameras, the viewfinder eyepiece is in the top left corner.
as a photojournalist, i’d rather shoot jpegs anyway, as much for the time savings at the computer after the fact as those during shooting.
the iq quality is very close to the film, also the operation is good, few weakness, but as old says "if i can live with it".
i’ve discovered that: 1) 4x really isn’t enough enlargement for most critical focusing, and 2) holding the shutter button down lightly will turn off the magnification temporarily to allow a quick check of overall framing anyway (a nice “undocumented” feature).
caucasian skin tones in sunset light tend towards golden, not ruddy.
as an operating tool in the hand, the digilux 2 is very successful.
the sales volume of such solutions, however, could not make up for the declines in the analogue business."
another touch, and you get information overload: exposure info, battery status, focus/flash/iso/white-balance mode icons, remaining exposures, etc. etc.
the price difference is non-existent if you factor in the need to increase the warranty to 3 years and buy raw conversion software for the panasonic.
shutter lag i compared the shutter lag of the digilux 2 to a leica m6.
this is a point that i've never seen anybody talk about and it's a real good thing that the digital world has given me.
hell with a setup like this they could even make a new digital mount for lenses designed with digital cameras in mind.
the photos you get with the leica/panasonic really are special.
there is one bug using manual exposure in this view: the needle and numerical readouts won’t change in real time as you change apertures or shutter speeds.
at 35mm and 28mm, i use scale-focusing for most fast work.
the d2/lc1 sounds nice, but this size thing.. it's just splitting hairs.
the large lovely lcd makes up in good measure for the deficiencies of the evf.
great optics and intuitive analog controls do not by themselves make for great shooting.
and it's so cheap now as 2nd in the turn's of the overall quality.
sounds just like rfdr vs slr debates for film cameras.
a touch of the ‘display’ button overlays a “rule of thirds” grid on the basic image.
smallest aperture: f/11 closest focus distance (all focal lengths): .3m (about 1 foot) filter size: 69mm internal electronic lcd viewfinder.
prices on the digilux are already tumbling=no buyers.
since the true focal-length range is 7mm-22.5mm, depth of field is extensive.
other flashes with safe trigger voltages can be used, but must depend on their built-in automation rather than ttl.
“pushing” digilux images beyond 400 the digilux 2 is limited to iso settings of 100/200/400.
the traffic was moving at 20 mph (i drove the street 3 times to check this) - which is 30 feet per second.
then when they fix the issue with w/a lenses they could have the new cameras use a mount that accepts both lenses, even if the m lenses needed an adaptor (kinda like the m can use screw mount lenses via an adaptor).
(pause while the “expose to the right” fans stop choking and get their hearts started again).
if you get past these and are still interested, then we can have fun with the camera’s good side - which is occasionally amazing.
don’t see any way to do it without giving up something else, though.
the internal viewfinder and rear lcd show identical views.
i hate the look of the a2, but it seems to have top-notch features.
the attached image is a crop, but not a 100% view of the pixels.
it's size, shape, and weight are ideal and thus, makes it very versatile.
each photo i take with this camera will feel special...a word i would hardly use for cameras such as nikon d70, minolta a2, etc.
i had a ball, loved the camera for it's point and shoot, me not being a pro.
but combined with the next issue, the lack of a fast raw buffer has been a “deal-killer” for many photographers who might really like to work with the camera otherwise.
there are many shooting situations where being able to scale-focus the lens, or set the shutter speed on a dial - even before the camera has been turned on - greatly simplify and speed up operation, compared to the push-here-while-twirling-that-and-watching-the-lcd controls common on most non-slr digicams.
the lens is very sharp, has crisp edge definition, and does a superb job of separating and defining colors and tones.
you must lift your finger and touch the shutter again to get an update on the “new” actual settings and metering.
for slower, critical manual-focus at f/2, i use the old film-maker’s trick of zooming in to focus and zooming out to frame.
of course the d2 can't mount a 10.5mm fisheye, 12-24 zoom, or 28f1.4/50f1.4/85f1.4.
i weep trying to scan my few "legacy" color slides.
put simply - the jpeg noise reduction at iso 400 has already fouled the image so badly that it can’t hold up to any further strain on the pixels.
in picture review mode, the camera can show your collected images as a 3x3 array of thumbnails, for fast navigation, or one image full-screen, or a zoomed view into that single image up to 16x.
the lens is a non-interchangeable 7mm-22.5mm f/2.0-2.4 vario-summicron zoom, equivalent to a 28mm-90mm zoom for 35mm film.
jpeg files are actually monochrome rgbs, not grayscale.
other than that - no significant additional news.
gives 28mm-80mm equivalent 3.5-5.6 (slow..but per above, so what?), and it works really well despite being.. er cheap.
there are many shooting situations where being able to scale-focus the lens, or set the shutter speed on a dial - even before the camera has been turned on - greatly simplify and speed up operation, compared to the push-here-while-twirling-that-and-watching-the-lcd controls common on most non-slr digicams.
if you want to get the best this lens can produce - you won’t count too much on dof.
i compared the shutter lag of the digilux 2 to a leica m6.
and in most cases, simply touching the shutter button will “clear” all menus/functions and take you directly back to shooting.
i, for one, would like to state that i will buy this camera for the leica brandname and the accompanying legend and quality.
build quality is average.
i bought it with the 18-70mm kit lens, and have purchased a few other lenses and filters to round out the package.
i've bought mine in april 2004 and till that date, had only found one single review which was good, but focused a bit on the good side.
let’s turn on the camera and set the lens to 6 feet for a quick “scale-focused” street photography grab shot.
disadvantages: evf, poor performance when camera is set to higher sensitivities, no raw buffer.
a 10d with a 24mm 2.8 prime for instance, is a nice compact camera.
i chose the leica over its panasonic twin because it was available.
the digilux can expose in the standard 4 modes - manual, aperture-priority, shutter-priority, or program.
and i can just use a light weight and sharp prime if i want.
i have had the opportunity to handle the d2's in person, clearly the evf is the biggest negative to me.
my street shooting style is to hold the camera to eyelevel for the briefest amount of time to frame the shot so the quality of the evf image is less important.
reading a review that points both sides is a real pleasure.
i dropped it in a nz river, on rocks, dried it off and it worked fine, seriously, but then i noticed a water spot in the centre of the lens where it dried, bugger!
the iso 100 image quality is extremely good - challenging the results from film scans with twice as many pixels due to the lens’s outstanding resolution.
in which case there is simply a viewfinder black-out of 1 second while the camera starts to save the image.
the b&w mode is interesting, and i like to use it if i am looking for b&w pictures.
" leica suffered a 35% decline in income from sales of its interchangeable-lens ("system") 35mm film cameras, i.e. the m and r lines.
i bought a nikon d200 plus all the lenses and gear but for me, i would get rid of it all and keep the digilux2.
as i mentioned in discussing the lens, the sharpness and occasional moire patterns in fine details lead me to believe that leica/panasonic have chosen to limit the amount of low-pass filtration over the bayer pattern - a route that kodak, in the 14n/pron/proc, and nikon, in the new d70, also seem to have followed.
i can only speak for myself, but for me the price seems fair.
i have never been able to adapt to gadget cameras very well.
the big-light-high definition-etc lcd screen.
i have read all the reports as to what the leicas can and can't do and my position today is that they give me a sense of image capturing where what i see is what i get, not what a camera/computer interprets.
in high continuous shooting mode, you subject will ask if you have taken the picture yet while you've already grabbed a dozen shots (read that somewhere).
when using manual focus, the viewfinder can be set to magnify the center of the image when the focus ring is touched.
this fact alone was enough for me to go with it.
being able to see the image prior to taking the shot, and not just an authopsy of the picture taken as with any dslr, is really a bonus i didn't expect.
they sort of ignored the fact that i was asking about the noise reduction, not noise per se.
so it's not a magical leica lens, but it's working with the magical canon cmos sensor, it's a tradeoff until i want (if ever) to buy an "l" lens.
even louis daguerre would recognize it as a camera.
enough to handle a burst of three “finest” jpegs (3.4 mb each) in a little over a second before it has to pause and write to the memory card.
reading between the lines, i get the impression that leica (or panasonic, or both) was overly concerned with noise.
the analog controls, with each control handling one function, are very fast and very transparent.
i love the 4:3 format and despite the modest 5 mp resolution, no one has complained about the file size since the quality of the lens and the spectacular quality of its jpeg rendition.
essentially useless for anything other than 4x6 prints or video, imho - and at 3x, don’t expect to use the resulting images to prove you actually saw “bigfoot” or “nessie”.
but to use them you must also put up with a loud “beep” that plays when the af locks, and every time you press a button on the back: choosing from menus, setting functions, scrolling through pictures, deleting pictures, confirming deletes, switching viewfinders.
other than its twin (panosonci lc1) the d2 is the only digital camera i'm aware of that allows the photographer to set all the shooting controls (aperture, zoom, focus, shutter speed, etc.) without powering on and entering various levels of level.
dean g , june 07, 2004; 05:03 p.m. so much is made out the "big dslr and bag of lenses".
it is not quite fair to criticize the noise level compared to a larger aps sized sensor.
the most startling thing about digital color is that, properly white balanced, it is remarkably clean and free from color casts compared to chemical imaging/scanning.
the price difference is non-existent if you factor in the need to increase the warranty to 3 years and buy raw conversion software for the panasonic.
for zone focusing street shooters this is a big advantage further reducing the lag time and making the d2 feel even more m-like.
the focusing ring is slightly “light” in touch, but allows one-finger focusing.
another touch, and you get information overload: exposure info, battery status, focus/flash/iso/white-balance mode icons, remaining exposures, etc. etc.
the vario-summicron “shoots” wider than its “28-90mm” rating.
read on... back when i was in my late teens/early 20's and breaking into the "extreme sports" photograph world, i first set my sights on being a snowboard photographer.
i've had leica m6s for years and they do not wear.
for travel, personal, street shooting it is the perfect range and speed.
there are users who say that the smooth gradation of the speckled grain from the noise produced by this camera, lends an air of character to the final image.
it is to say that this camera is not up to the standards that we have come to expect of that great company.
it pins the brightest pixels to about a level of 245-248 on the histogram, preventing burned-out whites.
since the zooming is mechanical, it does not have to extend or retract during startup/shutdown, saving seconds.
very strange - since i use the same finders, with the same limitations, all the time for film photography.
in the resulting snaps, i marked how far the car bumpers had moved by the time the shutter actually exposed the picture.
it's a good camera, but shame about the price.
p.m. god bless the marketing of a myth....and those who need the myth to be wyth.
but it eliminates the option of playing with photoshop’s “channel-mixer” after the fact to darken skies and such.
on a trip, who want to carry a big backpack with a bunch of equipment (dslr and 2.8 lenses along with tripod that will support them both).
don't know if it's the best that technology permits to be done, but is the best compared to any digital camera.
rangefinder cameras can’t frame accurately, can’t focus closer than a couple of feet, have trouble aligning near and far parts of the subject precisely (parallax), and won’t work with zoom lenses - but are very quiet and smooth.
even at ei 800 the results are as ugly as the average iso 3200 film.
to be honest...i have always been mesmirised by the little red dot...so i have been doing some research and i have managed to locate a mint unused digilux 1 and 2...there is 300 pounds difference between the two...iam familiar with the 1 and think that it takes good shots at 100asa...so the question is since im just getting back into it..is the extrs for the 2 worth it as really all i need is auto with option for manual.
this greatly reduces post-processing & tweaking.
even at iso 400 the b&w .jpg's look quite good and seem to me to have less noise than color .jpg's.
really expected the autofocus to be faster, for example.
i hoped wistfully for a camera that could come close to scans from iso 100 slide films.
if i had to name one aspect of the camera which most needed improvement, it would be one which was expressed earlier by s.g., namely, the focusing.
closest focus is about 1 foot (.3 meters) - which covers an area of about 4.5 x 6 inches (11cm x 16cm) at 90mm - hardly macro, but tighter than most non-macro lenses, and much tighter than almost any rangefinder lens.
needless to say, the images are great, and like many other reviewers and users acclaimed, the image is the key, and a bit of noise can always be cleared up with a variety of tools, including noise ninja, kodak gem pro, and others.
i “gelled” my flash for that warm “sunset light” look, and to balance with tungsten lights indoors, by the simple expedient of coloring a piece of translucent office tape with an orange marker and sticking it on the front.
so it's not a magical leica lens, but it's working with the magical canon cmos sensor, it's a tradeoff until i want (if ever) to buy an "l" lens.
you must lift your finger and touch the shutter again to get an update on the “new” actual settings and metering.
speaking of tripods (which i normally use about once a year) - i did try a few long exposures.
one advantage of a “shutterless” digicam is that the exposure can be metered directly from the live image sensor voltages instead of through a surrogate metering circuit/sensor.
outside of iso speed, there are 4 main “digital” image controls for jpeg shooting (they have no effect on raw files).
reading between the lines, i get the impression that leica (or panasonic, or both) was overly concerned with noise.
the leica-designed lens is almost supernatural in its ability to define details and separate tones and colors, and pushes right to the limits of what 5 megapixels can record - a bonus i wasn’t even expecting.
the lens barrel and rings are aluminum or some other light metal, not brass.
if you’re going to shoot in cold weather - start with an ‘empty’ memory card so you won’t need to replace it - or bring tweezers.
the digilux 2 uses this ability to “protect” the highlights when set to multi-area or centerweighted metering patterns.
in general, it was easy to handle all the controls (analog and digital) smoothly and without affecting neighboring buttons/rings/dials.
on the flip side, at iso 100 the digilux 2 produces jpeg images at the rate of 1 per second-and-a-half even in single-shot mode that are not just very, very good - they are astonishing.
if you want to get the best this lens can produce - you won’t count too much on dof.
but if you use the entire digilux image, the results look more like 8x10’s (a4s) cropped from a 24-75mm zoom.
seems as though leica/panasonic have subdued or left out the “low-pass” filter in order to maximize sharpness, even at the risk of the occasional “eel”.
the better price and included accessories made the decision for me.
i dropped it in a nz river, on rocks, dried it off and it worked fine, seriously, but then i noticed a water spot in the centre of the lens where it dried, bugger!
in the meantime for my travel, family, street shooting the d2 is a much welcome relief from a dslr and big bag of lenses.
i have yet to see a dmc/lc-1 in the flesh, whereas i’ve already shot 2200 exposures with the digilux.
“sunny” is generally too blue (especially here in denver, where there is a lot of extra uv light at a mile high).
a bit like early cars, which looked like horse carriages.
the d2 is not that much lighter, it is not that much smaller, and though the lens is fast, a camera like the 10d can gain 2-3 stops simply by having useable iso 200, 400, 800, and sometimes 1600.. or 3200 in a pinch.
the spot meter reads about 1% of the image area - roughly 2 degrees at “90mm” and 6 degrees at “28mm”.
but hey, i guess i just wouldn't look as cool walking around with my canon as i would with a leica!
i shoot mostly architecture and have been quite happy stitching together several images when i need either more resolution or wider perspective.
if sony/olympus/hp/fuji/canon/nikon had a similar digicam for far less i might buy one but for now d2 is unique and i am able and willing to pay for it.
i intend to keep the nikon around for telephoto and macro work.
if you have a good name, you've got to keep it good.
they will work in similar ways with similar capabilities.
while i make my living shooting with canon kit, my digilux 2(s) are never out of reach.
it changes drastically the approach to photography, the way the photographer interacts with the subject and widens the possibilities a lot.
connections: usb 2.0, a/v out/remote release, dc power in.
i would have a difficult time believing that the out-of-focus shots are primarily due to operator error such as not properly aiming at the intended subject or forgetting to pre-focus while composing.
the fact is that all cameras are tools and have both strengths and weaknesses.
a warranty fix, and easy to test for.
where to buy the leica digilux 2 can be obtained from many of the photo.net affiliate stores listed below.
and does lots photos for commercial work, like print out on the large wall...
the much larger variation for the m6 is interesting, and could be due to the mechanical linkage-chain in the shutter.
i am not a techy so decided not to dismantle but sent it to germany where after 2 goes thay got it right.
i bought a nikon d200 plus all the lenses and gear but for me, i would get rid of it all and keep the digilux2.
and i’ll acknowledge the usefulness of a bigger buffer for raw shooters - though i personally wouldn’t use it much.
we’ll use the digilux 2, and a couple of other popular digicams, the canon g5 and the sony 828, which i tested at the local electronics-appliance store.
this, i think, was sacrificed for marketing reasons, a pity.
i’ve seen comments that it is “styled” to look like a leica rangefinder.
all this would not be important in the least, but the camera lacks functionality, it needs a grip and a movable lcd.
from what i,ve seen the 1 does take natural 35mm type shots...iam not an experienced digital user.
i also keep a native version and a pansonic lc1.
then i lighten the resulting dark images in photoshop (after converting to 16/48-bits and upsampling to avoid posterizing/combing the histogram as much as possible) using curves and levels.
i predict that it will have a very short life.
i didn't use any nd filters, use the raw to save lots detail back from the sky and the shadow, the raw was very good at the time, but the raw is better now in any cameras, but still good enough, i can live with it and happy.
in addition to the 3.2x mechanical zoom range, the digilux 2 offers a 2x/3x “digital” zoom which transforms the lens into a “56-180mm” or “85-270mm”.
the leica digilux 2 can be obtained from many of the photo.net affiliate stores listed below.
it's a good camera, but shame about the price.
i wanted a digital camera that could do better than the 2700-ppi scans i was getting from iso 100/160 color negative films.
leica’s film lenses have a slight bias towards cyan-green - or more accurately, away from magenta/red.
don’t see any way to do it without giving up something else, though.
featured merchants andy piper has been a medical photographer, newspaper photojournalist, graphic designer, and assistant managing editor/graphics for the san juan (puerto rico) star.
but with its squared-off ends and large (69mm diameter) lens - it reminds me more of a canon 7 wearing the legendary 50mm f/0.95, or perhaps a nikon sp with a nikkor 50 f/1.1 mounted, especially if the nikkor and the vario-summicron have their massive lens shades attached.
of course, many rangefinder photographers don’t shoot longer than 50mm or 75mm anyway - so it fits into the “rangefinder” ethos.
well, this is more of a “cezanne filter” - as though a palette knife had been scraped over the light tones in the image.
anthony brookes , september 30, 2004; 04:40 a.m. having looked at a number of cumbersome large digital cameras the prospect of having one near m6 size with more conventional controls is attractive.
in a “news emergency” i could get a publishable newspaper picture at 800 or 1600, but not something i’d want to hang on the wall.
this is a point that i've never seen anybody talk about and it's a real good thing that the digital world has given me.
all of the “photographic” controls (exposure, focus, focal length, metering pattern, etc.) are analog dials, rings and levers.
what i was measuring was shutter lag plus my reaction time - but it’s still possible to compare relative lag times.
as with most rangefinder cameras, the viewfinder eyepiece is in the top left corner.
i hate the look of the a2, but it seems to have top-notch features.
slow raw processing, slow and unsure focusing, and an electronic viewfinder really should not exist on a camera in this price range - digital or not (for another $5 they could have quadrupled the size of the buffer).
if i weren’t primarily an iso 100 photographer, and willing to use creative workarounds on the few occasions i need 400, i would not be nearly so happy.
you could use a tilt & shift lens on a dslr but there is more weight in your camera bag and you don't have the zoom.
it’s still ugly - especially when sitting on the sofa and “fondling” the little beast.
using leica digilux-2 jpeg mode, no editing, 50% scaled.
it is very easy to get less-than-sharp pictures even at the “28mm” setting if you don’t focus carefully.
but i certainly appreciate the thoroughness of andy's evaluation.
with the digilux 2 using the evf, the cars had moved yet another 2.5 feet, on average, for an additional “viewfinder” lag of 83 msec., and an overall lag of 153 msecs.
note especially the faint rays in the top of the label - erased in the 200/400 exposures, retained in the “pushed” iso 100 shots.
a touch of the ‘display’ button overlays a “rule of thirds” grid on the basic image.
as an operating tool in the hand, the digilux 2 is very successful.
contrast, saturation, and sharpness can be set to “std.”, “low” or “high”.
well, after reading this excellent review and all its critics, i still went and bought the d2 for $1279 including tax and s/h. i could buy the panasonic version or even a nikon d-70 for much less, but i decided to purchase a leica d2, and i will tell you guys the reason why: the same reason i bought a rolex watch instead of a seiko or a timex: even thought the seiko or the timex watch offer better features than a rolex and they are even more precise...a rolex is a rolex.
landrum kelly , june 11, 2005; 07:50 a.m. to juan morino: you may have the dough to buy a rolex, but if you think that a camera with the capacity to save one (1) raw file at a time is the photographic equivalent of a rolex, then by all means spread the wealth around.
settings can be set with little practice without looking at the evf/lcd.
i get nicely exposed bounce shots even at iso 100 in settings where my “film” flash (vivitar 2800) often poops out on slide film.
closest focus is about 1 foot (.3 meters) - which covers an area of about 4.5 x 6 inches (11cm x 16cm) at 90mm - hardly macro, but tighter than most non-macro lenses, and much tighter than almost any rangefinder lens.
after you have used the on-screen menu lists to set up your major shooting preferences (raw or jpeg, image size/compression, saturation/contrast/sharpness, etc.) and minor shooting preferences (color or b&w, iso speed), it is possible to take pictures for hours, or even days, in all the automatic or manual modes, without ever again looking at a menu or lcd read-out, or touching a push-button - except, of course, the shutter release.
in the d2-only examples, the pixels are 100% as they came from the camera unless noted otherwise.)
i would have a difficult time believing that the out-of-focus shots are primarily due to operator error such as not properly aiming at the intended subject or forgetting to pre-focus while composing.
i've seen previous digital cameras from friends, but the lcd screen thay had were really bad.
the digilux 2 is limited to an 8-second maximum exposure time, and uses a ‘dark-frame’ second exposure to map and subdue ‘hot’ pixels.
the switch also changes the flash firmware to “external-flash” mode - no pre-flash, but otherwise the same options as using the internal flash.
first: even at “90mm”, precise manual focusing is essentially impossible on the unmagnified screen.
the d2/lc1 sounds nice, but this size thing.. it's just splitting hairs.
polarisor is mega bucks and unobtainium too.
i am considering pairing up the d2 with a 4mp panasonic dmc-fz10's leica designed 35-420mm (equiv) f2.8 - what a light weight killer combo that would be... cost: i don't complain about the premium cost of the d2 compared to the other digicams because i don't think any other digicam is comparable.
it does satisfy my search for less noise and yet i am quite sure that it will be replaced within two years from now, due to the current trend of digital slr camera production to bring out new models every two years, which in turn is due to the relative immaturity and rapid advances in the digital technology.
i’ve seen comments that it is “styled” to look like a leica rangefinder.
i was almost considering the purchase of a canon eos 10d, but since the good lenses are way too expensive and the whole kit makes for a heavy load, i have decided to get a minolta a2, which is about 1/2 the price of the digilux.
the sales volume of such solutions, however, could not make up for the declines in the analogue business."
the fact is that all cameras are tools and have both strengths and weaknesses.
so ideally, i’d start this review with the controls and handling and lens, because they are so distinctive.
good of course for vibrationless shutter release.
if nikon or canon or minolta had produced a camera as ‘manual’ as the digilux 2, i would have bought nikon/equipment/canon/minolta - whichever came first.
no focusing sound - manual or auto.
what failed to satisfy after almost half a year of daily use, was the frequent presence of noise, even in images that had been brightly lit at the time of exposure.
the control wheel on the back was very slippery and hard to turn with gloves, but fortunately most of its functions can be handled by the 4-way button inside it, which worked fine.
perhaps they were panicked by the hits the sony 828 has taken on the subject - and overdid the noise suppression as a result.
auto, sunny, cloudy, tungsten, electronic flash, manual - and black-and-white.
being used to the a-1, the digilux 2 manual operations made the decision easy, even with the high price compared to other cameras.
the lag time finally closes the books.
after you have used the on-screen menu lists to set up your major shooting preferences (raw or jpeg, image size/compression, saturation/contrast/sharpness, etc.) and minor shooting preferences (color or b&w, iso speed), it is possible to take pictures for hours, or even days, in all the automatic or manual modes, without ever again looking at a menu or lcd read-out, or touching a push-button - except, of course, the shutter release.
the viewfinders and focusing i’ve already touched on the major flaws of the evf.
an overall look a lot like ektachrome 100vs with some kodachrome and velvia touches thrown in - and with adjustable saturation and contrast.
but combined with the next issue, the lack of a fast raw buffer has been a “deal-killer” for many photographers who might really like to work with the camera otherwise.
and the b&w setting doesn’t affect raw files, which by their nature still contain the full color data from the original bayer pattern of the pixels.
if you’re going to shoot in cold weather - start with an ‘empty’ memory card so you won’t need to replace it - or bring tweezers.
the filter situation is unforgiveable.
and it does have built-in memory of about 11 megabytes or so.
set the shutter dial to “a”, and the camera will choose the shutter speed as you change apertures.
slow raw processing, slow and unsure focusing, and an electronic viewfinder really should not exist on a camera in this price range - digital or not (for another $5 they could have quadrupled the size of the buffer).
due to the 60-degree bounce angle, the flash provides a small amount of ‘kick’ light directly at the subject as well as bounce - but also sets a limit on how close you can shoot.
one very smart feature is that the viewfinder of choice can be set separately for shooting or reviewing pictures.
i doubt if the d2 bashers are not not guilty of succumbing to some premium brand name items.
the ccd dislocated itself and the camera had to go back for a new one.
this means that if you shoot as soon as you see the green dot, you may be shooting an unfocused picture.
better that the leica d2 be compared to other upscale point and shoots, or perhaps the oly e1 2/3 camera, but the aps sized dslrs are in a class by themselves imo.
the ergonomics of the digilux are superb.
occasionally the focus would shift a bit when turning the aperture ring.
since it is all digital anyways they should be able to have digitally projected infinatly variable frame lines, and a digital range finder "cam" system to go with the zoom.
added to the leica’s 20 msecs., that makes a shutter lag of about 70 msecs.
the digilux 2 uses this ability to “protect” the highlights when set to multi-area or centerweighted metering patterns.
the camera(s) may be the same but the backup is different.
at 400 iso there is a higher sensitivity.
the camera is still in use, since i haven't found a suitable replacement and it has certainly paid for itself.
as the a-1 is manual focus, it doesn't matter.
these images consistently displayed the warm tones of the familiar leica hue.
slrs solve the problems of the rangefinder - at the cost of noise, shake and bulk.
these images consistently displayed the warm tones of the familiar leica hue.
lines mark the actual bumper positions, the arrows mark the average for each group.
see what happens when you pull out that dslr with a big lens attached.
zooming in to 90mm to set focus and then zooming out for framing also works well.
even with it's quirky technical shortcomings, it is a camera that makes me want to go out and take pictures.
it seems to me to offer 28/35/50mm summicrons, 90mm elmarit, and 28-35-50 tri-elmar lenses all rolled into one.
i have waited to buy a digital camera until someone manafactured a camera much like my leica.
great dof is good for some situation but it cripples the camera for others, when one needs bokeh and the 3d effects it creates.
in april 2005 i sold my venice beach house and took off looking for zane grey's america, i had all my digital video cameras but wanted a reasonable digital still camera with a good lens, singular, didn't want digital and dust, so bought the digilux 2 from samy's in venice.
banks withold credit for a reason, and leica's ability to manage itself financially have a poor track record.
at its peak apertures (f/4-5.6) it is projecting details so fine that they start interacting with the bayer pattern on the image sensor, producing moires - witness the clothing textures and ebony tooling in the bagpiper picture - and dropping out fine details against the sky - see the tail-less bird below.
and i’ll acknowledge the usefulness of a bigger buffer for raw shooters - though i personally wouldn’t use it much.
filters: a big blunder is offering a sophisticated and costly lens with bizarre 69mm filter threads and not even offer filters for sale at the time of the camera's introduction.
it is my first digital, so i was kind of a newbie in the subject.
after all, i'm getting a leica-designed vario-summicron that covers the fields of view of a 28mm, 35mm, 50mm, 75mm and 90mm, plus a camera that produces magical image files in both jpg and raw formats, for less than the price of a current m6 or m7 body (or most single lenses for the m system).
they sort of ignored the fact that i was asking about the noise reduction, not noise per se.
from what i,ve seen the 1 does take natural 35mm type shots...iam not an experienced digital user.
has hot shoe and tripod socket that's located on same axis as the center of the lens (good features when you are trying to take panoramic photographs).
as for the slow raw processing without a built-in buffer, i use the raw mode primarily for stills and scenics, and so the slow processing means nothing, since i shoot with a tripod and the cable release (remote), and take my time.
on the other hand, the biggest positive i take away is that i find myself taking more pictures again.
the bulk is just inside the large end of my comfort zone - about the same as a small motor-incorporated film slr (nikon n/f80, contax aria).
the evf combines rangefinder quiet and smoothness with slr-like framing, focus range, and zoom capability - at the cost of an unpleasant view and slow (if eventually accurate) visual focusing.
user manual: the panasonic lc1 manual is available for download on the web and is far more useful compared to the leica d2 manual http://im2.onecall.com/image_products/panasonic/dmclc1_man.pdf another interesting link:
combine these with it's well placed controls a seasoned photographer would feel immediately comfortable using, and the digilux 2 is without comparison in the digital realm.
when you sleep through a technology change, you pays the price.
not any uglier than other evf cameras (except the new konica/minolta a2 - which is a big leap forward).
other points: evf is not so bad as people make it out to be, but i did find myself using the lcd to compose photos a fair number of times since it is just awesome.
i could obtain noise free images from exposures recorded by the ccd at iso 100, but everything else displayed a level of grain that i did not wish to see and more to the point, was something that i never learned to accept.
using iso 100 and a high shutter speed, this left me shooting at f/2.4 while trying to focus at f/5.6 (the reverse of an slr, where you focus at f/1.4 and shoot at f/5.6).
set the camera contrast to “high” - which increases local contrasts enough to “burn through” a lot of the noise smoothing, but drops out a lot of shadow detail.
there are users who say that the smooth gradation of the speckled grain from the noise produced by this camera, lends an air of character to the final image.
put simply - the jpeg noise reduction at iso 400 has already fouled the image so badly that it can’t hold up to any further strain on the pixels.
a red dot for "no focus" would have been a better warning than a flashing green dot, which can look like a "good focus" indicator for the first .5 second.
cloudy and flash go a bit overboard in adding yellow/red.
although the lens has a minimum aperture of f/11, diffraction begins to soften the image visibly below f/8.
i haven't yet gone to the trouble of acquiring in raw partially because the quality of the .jpg's is for me quite good.
in general, it was easy to handle all the controls (analog and digital) smoothly and without affecting neighboring buttons/rings/dials.
by making massive repetitive errors like this, leica shows some classic business mis-steps that could lead to its demise.
for motion and action shots, the jpeg high works rather well, and the pictures always retain that illusive and hard-to-explain leica quality.
as told in the review, i could have bought the lumix lc-1, but i live in brasil and there's no authorized lumix dealear that sells that model.
my dslr can't provide real-time histograms.
clearly less “grainy” noise than scans from color negs.
disadvantages: evf, poor performance when camera is set to higher sensitivities, no raw buffer.
pointing the camera at something dark and trying again cleared the problem each time.
when you sleep through a technology change, you pays the price.
at 4x, the magnified view appears in a box within the full-frame image, which supposedly allows one to keep track of the overall picture while focusing.
of course, many rangefinder photographers don’t shoot longer than 50mm or 75mm anyway - so it fits into the “rangefinder” ethos.
making junk and hoping the good name will obfuscate that its junk just doesn't work in the technology world.
battery: proprietary 7.2v, 1400 mah lithium-ion (leica bp-dc1-u, same as used in the digilux 1) comes with: battery, charger/ac power supply + cords, 64mb sd card, a/v cord, usb cord, strap, lens hood, hood cap, lens cap, cd-roms with photoshop elements, acdsee, and silverfast (for raw processing).
for slower, critical manual-focus at f/2, i use the old film-maker’s trick of zooming in to focus and zooming out to frame.
there is a physical lock/switch in the shoe that will turn off and lock down the pop-up flash if anything - even an accesory viewfinder - is mounted in the shoe.
nice crisp clear “iso 400” pictures.
first: even at “90mm”, precise manual focusing is essentially impossible on the unmagnified screen.
the bounce flash is surprisingly powerful.
the lens was collapsible, making the camera wonderfully pocketable.
people always amazed the photo's were taken by this old and only 5mg pix camera.
1) some d2/lc-1s apparently have poorly aligned sensors, so that pictures shot at "infinity" or elsewhere on the focusing ring are not actually focused there.
i wasn't familiar with his camera at all, and wasn't aware of its pedigree.
the resulting images are very different to the ones captured on film or large sensors.
but i found that while not great it really wasn't that bad.
the digital zoom is okay for amateur use and can be used on some rare occassions.
one excellent feature is that with the functon button the iso and wb settings can be set with little practice without looking at the evf/lcd.
i use three fuji medium format manual cameras, and i hope this digital will be a perfect companion to them.
the d2 has an af lens and to move to or from manual focusing you need to depress a small button, this is a good feature.
the digilux is heavier than a leica rangefinder wearing a tiny 35mm summicron, and lighter than the same leica with a 35 summilux asph.
as i wrote earlier, i am taking more pictures again.
there is a separate “flash” white-balance setting to compensate for the coolish color of the flashtube.
on the flip side, at iso 100 the digilux 2 produces jpeg images at the rate of 1 per second-and-a-half even in single-shot mode that are not just very, very good - they are astonishing.
rangefinder cameras can’t frame accurately, can’t focus closer than a couple of feet, have trouble aligning near and far parts of the subject precisely (parallax), and won’t work with zoom lenses - but are very quiet and smooth.
this fact alone was enough for me to go with it.
this difference is in my opinion far more significant that the minute differences in noise and definition.
they all have a mechanical feel - though most obviously connect to electronics beneath the surface.
it's late to the digital dinner table, its offerings are nothing special.
i think it's a great camera that takes very good photos.
polarisor is mega bucks and unobtainium too.
despite the digilux 2’s vague resemblance to a classic rangefinder camera, it is not a rangefinder.
i would have been better off with a $50 p&s camera in those cases.
s g , july 28, 2004; 03:45 p.m. after my earlier comments (see above), i actually did purchase a digilux 2, tried it for 2 weeks and then returned it.
as an operating tool in the hand, the digilux 2 is almost exactly what i wanted in a digital camera.
this difference is in my opinion far more significant that the minute differences in noise and definition.
except that i've quit shooting slow color film.
on the other hand, the digilux 2’s jpeg images are somewhat “brittle”.
you can tell if you missed the moment, or if the exposure or focus were really off.
if you are unwilling to pay that price go for the sony/kodak/etc but you don't need to criticize leica cameras as not worth it.
third: the viewfinder lags behind reality by about 1/12th second (80 milliseconds +/-).
it just plain fits into my life much more compatibly than any dslr.
and they really don't make things like this camera anymore.
finally, you can add a live histogram (brightness only, not colors) to the “las vegas” view.
the leica digilux 2 puts the fun back in making pictures.
i could wish very strongly for an upgrade to the camera’s software that would make it possible to turn off the noise-suppression at iso 200/400 via a menu selection similar to the color and saturation settings.
black & white photos come out great in this camera, which i have found to be generally quite difficult with film cameras.
neither viewfinder is especially good for critical evaluation of exposure, color, or sharpness.
of course the d2 can't mount a 10.5mm fisheye, 12-24 zoom, or 28f1.4/50f1.4/85f1.4.
12:45 a.m. andy, the japanese website of panasonic seem to indicate that all the so-called leica lenses in the panasonic cameras are actually designed by panasonic and quality-controlled using leica standard equipment and processes and that the designs of the lenses are approved by leica ag.
in manual focus the lock release button can be used to set the distance by feel without looking, similar to tabbed leica m lenses.
the digilux is heavier than a leica rangefinder wearing a tiny 35mm summicron, and lighter than the same leica with a 35 summilux asph.
using direct flash, the huge lens shade will cast a shadow in the bottom of pictures shot at “28mm” - but the lens alone will not.
an overall look a lot like ektachrome 100vs with some kodachrome and velvia touches thrown in - and with adjustable saturation and contrast.
spot focusing helps somewhat, but it's not easy to judge until the image is viewed on a proper computer monitor.
in other words, leica did not design the lumix lenses at all, let alone manufacturing them.
the styling is nice and everybody can recognize it as a horse carriage - sorry, as a film camera, which it is not.
it does satisfy my search for less noise and yet i am quite sure that it will be replaced within two years from now, due to the current trend of digital slr camera production to bring out new models every two years, which in turn is due to the relative immaturity and rapid advances in the digital technology.
set the aperture to “a” and the camera will choose the aperture as you choose the shutter speed.
john falkenstine , march 07, 2005; 12:52 a.m. my june 6 2004 observation was correct "leica ist kaputt" now going into receivership as credit has been withdrawn from the company.
my dslr can't provide real-time histograms.
i do like being able to compose in b&w mode and still shoot colour raw though.
in shooting mode, four levels of information can be shown in the viewfinder.
and when i factor in the accessories and glass that i've accumulated, the nikon is no cheaper than the leica.
contributed content used with permission.
they have always been somewhat confusing for me and seemed to take away most of the personal touch in photography.
leica had a gain of 40% in income from sales of compact cameras - which includes the digilux 2.
from the point of view of the company?s board of management, these facts prove leica?s ability to offer attractive digital solutions.
needless to say, the images are great, and like many other reviewers and users acclaimed, the image is the key, and a bit of noise can always be cleared up with a variety of tools, including noise ninja, kodak gem pro, and others.
(btw, in the film/digital comparisons here, the digilux 2 images were upsampled about 40% to match image size with the film scans.
the resulting images are very different to the ones captured on film or large sensors.
the size of the focus area has two settings - a “spot” area smaller than 1% of the image, and a larger “box” about 1/5th the height and width of the screen.
not any uglier than other evf cameras (except the new konica/minolta a2 - which is a big leap forward).
black & white photos come out great in this camera, which i have found to be generally quite difficult with film cameras.
the spot af also did not always seem to find the targeted spot.
the vario-summicron will blur backgrounds and foregrounds when used near its minimum focus at maximum aperture.
the areas of critique are valid, though i got accustomed to the electronic viewfinder.
i have yet to see the perfect camera for all situations.
i don’t see much noise beyond the normal amounts for iso 100 or 400 in an 8-second exposure - perhaps 50 specks out of 5 million pixels that might be under- or over-corrected hot pixels.
leica is not even close to receivership.
i had a ball, loved the camera for it's point and shoot, me not being a pro.
- other points: evf is not so bad as people make it out to be, but i did find myself using the lcd to compose photos a fair number of times since it is just awesome.
and it does have built-in memory of about 11 megabytes or so.
i doubt if the d2 bashers are not not guilty of succumbing to some premium brand name items.
advantages (my opinion): fast lens with lots of dof.
second: in really bright light the camera stops down the aperture to help control screen brightness.
alas, it too is already showing signs of the metallic finish wearing through to a very unattractive white underneath.
it's a tool which does nothing perfectly, but most things well.
i do realize i could somehow improve my technique and 'learn' to work the d2, however, there was just this nagging disappointment in this otherwise gorgeous camera.
i have waited to buy a digital camera until someone manafactured a camera much like my leica.
the d2 has an af lens and to move to or from manual focusing you need to depress a small button, this is a good feature.
the upper images were shot with the camera set to iso 100 but underexposed 1 and 2 stops and lightened in photoshop.
it will be interesting when the epson ships with a real optical viewfinder and leica lens mount compatibility.
you end up with smeared highlights, noisy shadows, and a weird transition area between the two.
with the digilux 2 and direct viewing, the cars had, on average, moved an additional 1.5 feet, or an additonal lag of 50 msecs.
i have the same feeling with the digilux 2, but in a better way.
although the lens has a minimum aperture of f/11, diffraction begins to soften the image visibly below f/8.
the camera can be set to magnify the center of the image 4x or 8x for manual focus (the magnification turns on when the focus ring is touched, and turns off a couple of seconds later), but even using this focus-assist, focusing at “28mm” is still troublesome.
the company's income is not sufficient to support its continuing operation..
generally, i find the auto setting to be most reliable for daylight use.
contrast, saturation, and sharpness can be set to “std.”, “low” or “high”.
a great camera, a great pal to travel with, always loved.
bottom line for me is that the d2 has let me get photographs in situations when i would not have otherwise gotten them with other available equipment.
1) testing color rendition with the colorchecker, most colors are rendered quite well, but blues - especially dark “nylon sportswear” blues - and to a lesser extent, yellows, tend to hypersaturate.
for zone focusing street shooters this is a big advantage further reducing the lag time and making the d2 feel even more m-like.
setting contrast and saturation to “low” results in very softly toned images, with histograms that end well short of black and white, and the appearance of a freshly-born tiff from a raw file.
the lcd gives me the opportunity to see the picture before it is taken and that is something marvellous.
i would concur that many controls can be manipulated by feel alone such as the metering pattern switch.
shifting to shooting aperture).
the company's income is not sufficient to support its continuing operation..
imo the d2's compromises and combination of features are ideal for my style of photography.
well, this is more of a “cezanne filter” - as though a palette knife had been scraped over the light tones in the image.
even with it's quirky technical shortcomings, it is a camera that makes me want to go out and take pictures.
in picture review mode, the camera can show your collected images as a 3x3 array of thumbnails, for fast navigation, or one image full-screen, or a zoomed view into that single image up to 16x.
you can select your 4 most often-used controls - perhaps iso, contrast, white balance and auto-focus area - and assign them to a “quick function” list that can be accessed via the 4-way toggle button, saving a lot of scrolling through menus.
i wish there was focus confirmation in manual focus and a distance read-out would be useful.
price: $1850.00 us additional functions that i don’t use, but may be of interest: video with sound at 10 or 30 fps, 320 x 240 resolution, about 8 minutes worth per 256 mb of memory at 30 fps; stop-animation, (a series of “still” pictures that end up as a video file, for claymation™-type animations); sound recording that can be appended to still pictures (news photographers could use this to have subjects spell their names, i guess); dpof settings for ordering prints from a digital minilab; down-sampling and/or cropping of pictures in the camera; showing pictures as a timed ‘slide show’ on the lcd or a tv (camera comes with an a/v outlet and mini-plug/rca cord); remote control from a computer via usb connection; direct printing to a usb-direct-print-compatible (whew!) printer.
the viewfinder of the leica digilux 2 is lousy.
enough to handle a burst of three “finest” jpegs (3.4 mb each) in a little over a second before it has to pause and write to the memory card.
and while it was easy to slide open the door for the memory card and press/release it - it was then impossible to get a grip on the card and remove it the rest of the way.
i found an intersection where a building blocked my view of oncoming cross-traffic, so that i couldn’t anticipate when a car would enter the scene.
as a long time user of the leica m system, i knew going in that any leica camera would carry a premium price.
sure, with a dslr, i wouldn't have to worry about the slow raw recording and limited iso, but the smaller size gave me oppurtunity to take pictures, i would not have been able to do with a bigger dslr.
i was almost considering the purchase of a canon eos 10d, but since the good lenses are way too expensive and the whole kit makes for a heavy load, i have decided to get a minolta a2, which is about 1/2 the price of the digilux.
of course it isn't perfect and even doesn't work well in all conditions.
come on leica, make you digital cameras with a better finish than this.
at “90mm”-f/2.4 the image starts to degrade visibly within 1.5 inches either side of correct focus.
as i wrote earlier, i am taking more pictures again.
third: the viewfinder lags behind reality by about 1/12th second (80 milliseconds +/-).
looks great on the bluish lcd when reviewing pictures, but too yellow once the pictures are loaded into photoshop.
it might not be as easy to throw a background out of focus but you won't get blurry photographs like those taken with some dslrs with fast heavy lenses attached.
the camera is still in use, since i haven't found a suitable replacement and it has certainly paid for itself.
but i am tired of holding cameras that feel like a plastic toy.
no raw buffer the digilux 2 can save pictures in a raw format.
at 28mm - barrel distortion is obvious, about 3-4% at the corners, and there is a moderate amount of purple/green color fringing (3 pixels-worth at the corners) in many pictures, light fall-off is about 1.5 f/stops at the corners and is rather abrupt.
the most obvious one is to shoot raw files, which bypass all “in-camera” firmware processing, and thus the noise supression.
d2 ccd vs the world: the d2's 5mp sensor creates wonderful images.
the shutter lag on the digilux 2 is pretty minimal, but the viewfinder lag has cost me ‘moments’.
however, digital of any kind is not my cup of tea and despite what some other people say regarding the availibility of processing outlets and photoshop, i just don't like the process.
even at “90mm” and with the magnification turned on, the dof was so wide that an “infinity” subject still looked sharp with the lens set as close as 4 feet - a recipe for fuzzy pictures.
and the “tic-tic” is enough to tell me the shutter fired.
it is not quite fair to criticize the noise level compared to a larger aps sized sensor.
also, think about all that extra glass you are carrying that your dslr's sensor isn't utilizing.
perhaps they were panicked by the hits the sony 828 has taken on the subject - and overdid the noise suppression as a result.
gianfranco ceccolini , october 31, 2004; 05:09 p.m. first of all, i'd like to say that's a very good review of the camera.
an excellent starting place for some kinds of landscape work, with a long tonal range (but obviously not sharpness) that approaches large-format images.
outcome: almost no smoothing, at least a 4x increase in resolution over the “smoothed” parts of a straight iso 400 picture, an increase in noise (probably to about where it would have been at 400 if leicasonic weren’t smoothing it), and a slight increase in saturation.
i don't miss changing lenses or missing shots because i had the wrong lens on the camera.
press a button on the back once, and the flash head pops up to a 60-degree angle for bounce flash.
i would concur that many controls can be manipulated by feel alone such as the metering pattern switch.
i have use one digilux2 and 4 panasonic lc1, there were all sold, but i just miss the camera so much, and also bought one 2nd few days ago.
it strips away magenta casts from sky and clouds.
i take with this camera will feel special...a word i would hardly use for cameras such as nikon d70, minolta a2, etc.
for me this review was especially interesting, since it came out at the same time as i posted my panasonic lumix dmc-lc1 for sale on ebay, which is in turn about five months after i originally purchased it.
i decided upon the lc1 largely from reading the personal experiences of people on the dpreview forums and seeing the images that they displayed.
but at least the country club set will no longer have to be embarrassed hauling around a canon, nikon or ugh--- hp.
sure, with a dslr, i wouldn't have to worry about the slow raw recording and limited iso, but the smaller size gave me oppurtunity to take pictures, i would not have been able to do with a bigger dslr.
at 8x, the magnified area fills the screen.
slrs solve the problems of the rangefinder - at the cost of noise, shake and bulk.
it’s possible to dial up one of three “hollywood” shutter sounds (“clack”, “click”, or “cluck”) that play when you fire the shutter.
maybe so, maybe... it is interesting to note that despite the high level of manual operation available with this camera, even when the aperture ring is turned to the f/2 setting, that the user is very often comprimised [forced] by the camera into accepting a f/2.4 aperture rating.
the vario-summicron “shoots” wider than its “28-90mm” rating.
in others words - it was the high-quality lines with the "good name" that went into the tank - and it's the so-called "junk" digilux 2 that's saved leica's bacon - or at least slowed the decline.
at 100 the digilux is a bit ahead of “traditional” iso 100/125 silver films in terms of grain/noise, but not tmax/delta or iso 50 film.
the image seen in my computer's monitor is way better, but my eyes are learning to see the real photo through the lcd.
lens is permanently attached to camera so you won't get dust on the sensor (can be costly to fix on dslrs).
didn’t like being limited to one or two focal lengths; didn’t like the parallax error; didn’t like the big lens protuding into the viewfinder corner; didn’t like the extra bulk on top.
steven chen , november 16, 2005; 04:10 p.m. sample shot at halifax, canada.
you can select your 4 most often-used controls - perhaps iso, contrast, white balance and auto-focus area - and assign them to a “quick function” list that can be accessed via the 4-way toggle button, saving a lot of scrolling through menus.
whilst the camera has many other impressive qualities, it is this first major drawback which compels me to hang on to my money.
seems as though leica/panasonic have subdued or left out the “low-pass” filter in order to maximize sharpness, even at the risk of the occasional “eel”.
a raw workflow is like the zone system - a brilliant tool for some kinds of photography, just not mine.
the areas of critique are valid, though i got accustomed to the electronic viewfinder.
but my digilux took a 3-foot fall out of my camera bag onto carpeted concrete the first night i had it, and survived with no marks or damage.
my criteria for aesthetic concerns, were won over by the colour rendition that i could see in the images i had seen.
i simply find that i am becoming more interested in creating wider angled images and therefore want to explore beyond the field of view provided with a 28mm lens.
taking into account the average digital slr (or the epson rangefinder) magnification of 1.6 one needs a 17.5mm f2 err, which doesn't exist so for the wide angle digital user this camera is unique.
the switch also changes the flash firmware to “external-flash” mode - no pre-flash, but otherwise the same options as using the internal flash.
beautiful it is, as are all leicas (including my old but still functioning iiic).
the lance is really very good quality, see what it does to the 5mg iq, i really don't know what to complain about.
this, i think, was sacrificed for marketing reasons, a pity.
i've got a rolleyflex from a friend for some time and was realy interested in seeing the picture that would be taken on the unpolished glass.
i immediately turned this off, since i am far more interested in the next picture than the one i've already taken.
the meter can be set to center-weighted, spot metering, and “multi-area” patterns.
also, it's hard for a dslr to take shots in low light with as much dof.
although this is currently a mute point with my new dslr, because i have an f/2.8 20-35mm zoom lens which is transformed into an effective 30-52.5mm lens due to the 1.5x factoring by the ccd.
pictures have a quality to them that is special.
i took a low light shot of a band and a large crowd all inside a tent that came out amazing.
had it been a panasonic i would have paid a substantial sum for a re-do which would not have been covered by insurance.
at 4 feet and f/2 there is clear softening of the image from peak performance within 4 inches either side of correct focus.
spot focusing helps somewhat, but it's not easy to judge until the image is viewed on a proper computer monitor.
and the b&w setting doesn’t affect raw files, which by their nature still contain the full color data from the original bayer pattern of the pixels.
but a manual-focus “feature” buried somewhere in the electronics is simply not in the same league as a focus ring on the lens that can be set with a flick of the finger even before the camera is powered up.
i only want a step-up ring and even this is still not generally available.
i did use the camera extensively for the 2 weeks so here are my comments / observations: - the design is beautiful and the camera just has a unique style to it - exposures for the most part were fine, 90% of the time as i would want them to be although some results were very disappointing - focus was the most disappointing for me, since of the more than 200 or 300 photos i took, about 75% were not focussed.
and i can just use a light weight and sharp prime if i want.
comparing a “b&w” shot of a gretag colorchecker to a color image converted via the channel-mixer, the camera’s internal channel-mix is roughly red 35%/green 55%/blue 10%.
one of the reasons i bought a digital camera with fixed lens in place of and dslr (i used a great canon a-1 that belonged to my father since 1979 and was given to me in 2000 and my first idea when moving to digital was getting a dslr, probably rebel or d70)is because i can't stand the idea of having to clean the sensor once a year or so.
i luckily purchased my d2 in april from a seller who included a 69mm panasonic mc filter (as well as a panasonic remote release and sandisk ultra ii sd card for cheap).
one can buy a sigma 20mm f1.8 which gives about 30mm but it's massive and it's a sigma.
ergonomics: i agree with everyone that egonomics are superb.
lens is permanently attached to camera so you won't get dust on the sensor (can be costly to fix on dslrs).
they'd sell a zillion d3s at 3x canon's price if they just managed to equal canon g6.
since people vary, there is no perfect size and weight for a camera.
if you shoot leica, your standards are high, and to reach those standards, you'll need to tweak the images in photoshop to make them be the best they can be.
white lights show purple fringes - red and blue blooming combined.
the vario-summicron will blur backgrounds and foregrounds when used near its minimum focus at maximum aperture.
i have yet to see a dmc/lc-1 in the flesh, whereas i’ve already shot 2200 exposures with the digilux.
tungsten does ok, but undercorrects a bit, leaving some residual yellow under house lights.
it’s the best choice under non-daylight light sources, but needs to have a lot of blue compensation dialed in if the light is short on blue wavelengths (see blue-channel issues below).
one advantage of a “shutterless” digicam is that the exposure can be metered directly from the live image sensor voltages instead of through a surrogate metering circuit/sensor.
this camera fills a gap for me, and should be a good carry around camera for general use.
in that case i put my left hand in front of the flash to bounce the light more vertically and off a nearby wall behind me (i've only tried this so far in b&w to avoid potential color casts).
leica’s film lenses have a slight bias towards cyan-green - or more accurately, away from magenta/red.
small cameras are winning photo competitions.
so i’ve already recovered more than the leica/panasonic price difference.
the digilux has been out over a year, with no replacement on the horizon - hardly a "short life" in the digital world (where, for example, leica's partner panasonic went from the fz1 through the fz10 to the fz20 in a year).
in leica's words (3-q report march 1, 2005): "these reductions of credit lines do not as yet endanger the company?s solvency.
in manual focus the lock release button can be used to set the distance by feel without looking, similar to tabbed leica m lenses.
as i mentioned in discussing the lens, the sharpness and occasional moire patterns in fine details lead me to believe that leica/panasonic have chosen to limit the amount of low-pass
it is my first digital, so i was kind of a newbie in the subject.
i’m too busy seeing pictures to notice.
i do wish that the on/off switch was in the locaton of the meter pattern switch and vice versa since all my nikons have the power switch around the shutter release button.
if the d2 is disappointing in quality, then leica will have much to lose.
the spot meter reads about 1% of the image area - roughly 2 degrees at “90mm” and 6 degrees at “28mm”.
so the question is since im just getting back into it..is the extrs for the 2 worth it as really all i need is auto with option for manual.
the leather treatment was done by cameraleather.com and the bags by m-classics.com.
the lens barrel and rings are aluminum or some other light metal, not brass.
films, and can’t go places that tri-x and an f/1.4 lens can go.
and while rangefinders and even slr screens can get out of alignment, with the evf you are focusing using the actual pixels that will make up the final picture - the image sensor can’t ever get out of alignment with itself.
at focal lengths above “50mm”, autofocus is usually fastest (the af lock time is about 1 second).
outside of iso speed, there are 4 main “digital” image controls for jpeg shooting (they have no effect on raw files).
due to the 60-degree bounce angle, the flash provides a small amount of ‘kick’ light directly at the subject as well as bounce - but also sets a limit on how close you can shoot.
i could wish very strongly for an upgrade to the camera’s software that would make it possible to turn off the noise-suppression at iso 200/400 via a menu selection similar to the color and saturation settings.
press the button again, and the base pops up another 60 degrees, pointing the flash at the subject.
normally i am wary of new products but yours is the second review i have read which suggests the digilux 2 is well worth looking at.
i would mention, somewhat randomly, these verbose opinions: aethetics: the d2 is in my humble opinion the best looking camera ever.
see what happens when you pull out that dslr with a big lens attached.
the b&w mode is interesting, and i like to use it if i am looking for b&w pictures.
i have found that the only way i can get acceptable photos is by shooting in the 'm' manual mode, setting all controls myself.
you could use a tilt & shift lens on a dslr but there is more weight in your camera bag and you don't have the zoom.
it's not hard to learn, as you'll only be using a small portion of all that photoshop was designed to do, but once there, you'll love the things that you can do that you could never do in traditional silver/dye photography - regional contrast control, manipulation of particular colors within the image, etc.
i've seen previous digital cameras from friends, but the lcd screen thay had were really bad.
the styling is nice and everybody can recognize it as a horse carriage - sorry, as a film camera, which it is not.
so far as i can tell, the digilux has about every possible flash capability generally available - normal sync up to 1/2000th second (yes, 3 zeroes is correct!); slow-speed sync; sync at the beginning or end of the exposure (i refuse to call it “second-curtain-sync” when the camera has no shutter curtains); flash exposure compensation of +/- 2 stops for fill.
but it eliminates the option of playing with photoshop’s “channel-mixer” after the fact to darken skies and such.
great optics and intuitive analog controls do not by themselves make for great shooting.
it helped me a lot in my decision process, buying my digital camera.
less grain than most 400 color negs i’ve scanned, a bit worse than provia 400f, especially in the shadows.
i don't miss changing lenses or missing shots because i had the wrong lens on the camera.
otherwise i save my editing for the computer monitor, where the images are generally sharper, warmer, and darker than the camera displays them.
in fact, there have been times when i've set up for a shot by feel alone, without even looking at the camera controls.
very strange - since i use the same finders, with the same limitations, all the time for film photography.
a 10d with a 24mm 2.8 prime for instance, is a nice compact camera.
total lag (including my reaction time) was 233 msecs.
so ideally, i’d start this review with the controls and handling and lens, because they are so distinctive.
although this is currently a mute point with my new dslr, because i have an f/2.8 20-35mm zoom lens which is transformed into an effective 30-52.5mm lens due to the 1.5x factoring by the ccd.
correct autofocus is indicated by a green dot that lights up in the viewfinder.
if you bring a "bag of lenses", it's only because you want to, not because you have to, for crying out loud.
cloudy and flash go a bit overboard in adding yellow/red.
anybody who tells you that their dslr takes better photos than the leica/panasonic has never compared the results.
for me the major issues are quality in the optics rather than post-process correction and the simplicity/user-friendliness of the tool.
and while it was easy to slide open the door for the memory card and press/release it - it was then impossible to get a grip on the card and remove it the rest of the way.
all this would not be important in the least, but the camera lacks functionality, it needs a grip and a movable lcd.
darker skin tones are rendered in browns instead of purples.
i also keep a native version and a pansonic lc1.
the d2 is also missing the power-on led of the lc1.
the bokeh is quite beautiful.
workarounds for using iso 400 shoot raw and accept the lag between shots add some “grain” in photoshop to fill in the ‘smoothed’ areas, and the results are still nearly as sharp as some “old technology” 400 b&w films.
and while rangefinders and even slr screens can get out of alignment, with the evf you are focusing using the actual pixels that will make up the final picture - the image sensor can’t ever get out of alignment with itself.
i've used dslrs and other digicams, but this is the first digital camera which i enjoy using and find myself wanting to use.
you can compare the effect with a 400 or 800 iso film at the 35mm format.
focus: in manual focus i agree that mf2 (8x) setting works better for me.
i have had the opportunity to handle the d2's in person, clearly the evf is the biggest negative to me.
at its peak apertures (f/4-5.6) it is projecting details so fine that they start interacting with the bayer pattern on the image sensor, producing moires - witness the clothing textures and ebony tooling in the bagpiper picture - and dropping out fine details against the sky - see the tail-less bird below.
in a “news emergency” i could get a publishable newspaper picture at 800 or 1600, but not something i’d want to hang on the wall.
at which point the digilux will be the same price as any other well-used digital camera - free.
the viewfinder is electronic - a tv set behind an eyepiece.
as with all digital zooms, it simply magnifies the image from the middle of the sensor, without gathering any more detail.
better that the leica d2 be compared to other upscale point and shoots, or perhaps the oly e1 2/3 camera, but the aps sized dslrs are in a class by themselves imo.
i hear that one can visualize and shoot b&w in raw mode and retain the option of color images later using the raw file.
when the shutter is pressed, there is a faint internal “tic-tic” (i think it’s the aperture blades shifting to shooting aperture).
after all, i loved to snowboard and i... olympus om-d e-m5 announcement and preview pentax k-01 preview latest learning articles three tips for selling/showing your photos in a gallery there are few industries as heart-wrenching as the fine art business.
remote: the remote cable threaded down my shirt sleeve and switch in left hand combined with 1930's aufsu waist level finder makes a very stealthy outfit.
comfortable “35mm camera” ergonomics the “wideness” of the zoom at “28mm” dead silence and smoothness of shutter release short shutter lag 100% framing without parallax problems extremely good “off the sensor” exposures, that protect the highlights in multi-spot mode viewfinder and rear lcd separately assignable to shooting and review modes (1-switch changeover) automatic ‘escape’ from most menus by touching the shutter button automatic ‘escape’ from focus magnification for framing by holding the shutter button built-in bounce-flash capability excessive noise-smoothing at iso 200 and 400, with no user control available long delays between shots when shooting raw viewfinder “lag” the “ugliness” of evf/lcd viewing/focusing in general too much dof (on occasion) for reliable focusing with the evf at 90mm and large apertures in bright light chip resolution that doesn’t fully support the abilities of the lens long end of the zoom range a bit short some often-accessed controls (e.g. focus magnification on/off) not available through the “quick set” of 4 custom functions and (yes!), digital image quality that is “only” better than most 35mm color neg.
and the “tic-tic” is enough to tell me the shutter fired.
i wish there was focus confirmation in manual focus and a distance read-out would be useful.
as a photojournalist, i’d prefer “sharp and noisy” to “blurry and noiseless”.
the on/off switch on the panasonic lc1 verson of the d2 is more ergonomic as it lies closer to the thumb than the d2 plus pushing the lever up for on and down for off makes more sense.
but if you use the entire digilux image, the results look more like 8x10’s (a4s) cropped from a 24-75mm zoom.
imo the d2's compromises and combination of features are ideal for my style of photography.
outcome: almost no smoothing, at least a 4x increase in resolution over the “smoothed” parts of a straight iso 400 picture, an increase in noise (probably to about where it would have been at 400 if leicasonic weren’t smoothing it), and a slight increase in saturation.
the camera(s) may be the same but the backup is different.
focusing and zooming are internal - so the lens never changes shape or size.
the digilux can expose in the standard 4 modes - manual, aperture-priority, shutter-priority, or program.
once they resolve the snaggles of bad high iso in-camera jpegs and the truly, truly sad unacceptable spec of a 1 frame raw burst rate...
focus/zoom feel - not as silky smooth as i'd like and a little lightwieght for my taste.
if you shoot leica, your standards are high, and to reach those standards, you'll need to tweak the images in photoshop to make them be the best they can be.
12:45 a.m. andy, the japanese website of panasonic seem to indicate that all the so-called leica lenses in the panasonic cameras are actually designed by panasonic and quality-controlled using leica standard equipment and processes and that the designs of the lenses are approved by leica ag.
4/3 will enable much smaller lenses (far smaller diagonal than 2x3)and in turn a much smaller body...presumably 8mp, like olympus.
an excellent starting place for some kinds of landscape work, with a long tonal range (but obviously not sharpness) that approaches large-format images.
if the d2 had an aps sized sensor then the lens would be either impossibly huge or worse - limited in focal length and/or aperture.
at 28mm - barrel distortion is obvious, about 3-4% at the corners, and there is a moderate amount of purple/green color fringing (3 pixels-worth at the corners) in many pictures, light fall-off is about 1.5 f/stops at the corners and is rather abrupt.
about on the level of the quietest leaf shutters, at most.
i like the compact, grippable ergonomics.
in other words, i wanted the nikon d2h, but i decided to save myself 2000 euros, at least for now that is... here is an admittedly unfair comparison of noise results, but i think that they are interesting representations, and anyway i currently have no other more relevant images stored here at photo.net: panasonic lc1 @ iso 100 peter robert schellhammer , december 06, 2004; 08:00
has hot shoe and tripod socket that's located on same axis as the center of the lens (good features when you are trying to take panoramic photographs).
(having an f/2 aperture helps, of course).
so when you get right down to it, it's a $600 sony 717 with a $1200 leica price sticker added and without the innovative features like laser af assist and nightshot.
you end up with smeared highlights, noisy shadows, and a weird transition area between the two.
there is a physical lock/switch in the shoe that will turn off and lock down the pop-up flash if anything - even an accesory viewfinder - is mounted in the shoe.
i know that 5mp is less that the lenses "deserve" but raw mode makes this a minor problem.
as the a-1 is manual focus, it doesn't matter.
it’s scary when you open a color image and all the grays have identical amounts of rgb - 160/161/160 or 120/119/120 or the like.
just served for picture identification while in play mode and framing when shooting.
i had seen examples of this before i bought the camera, but the vast majority of images posted, whether on the forums or on website reviews, were shot with the ccd exposure rated at 100 iso, so i incorrectly assumed that the f/2 lens overcame the need for such a frequent use of higher iso rates.
well, first i must admit, i did not read all comments before i started writing mine.
setting contrast and saturation to “low” results in very softly toned images, with histograms that end well short of black and white, and the appearance of a freshly-born tiff from a raw file.
using direct flash, the huge lens shade will cast a shadow in the bottom of pictures shot at “28mm” - but the lens alone will not.
i only want a step-up ring and even this is still not generally available.
left-eyed shooters end up the same place they do with most camera designs - out in the cold.
i get nicely exposed bounce shots even at iso 100 in settings where my “film” flash (vivitar 2800) often poops out on slide film.
since the zooming is mechanical, it does not have to extend or retract during startup/shutdown, saving seconds.
so - you can shoot fast, or you can shoot raw.
beautiful it is, as are all leicas (including my old but still functioning iiic).
if sony/olympus/hp/fuji/canon/nikon had a similar digicam for far less i might buy one but for now d2 is unique and i am able and willing to pay for it.
4/3 will enable much smaller lenses (far smaller diagonal than 2x3)and in turn a much smaller body...presumably 8mp, like olympus.
i am not dismayed that a leica is very expensive.
just for grins, i put on a heavy set of ragg-wool gloves and tried operating the digilux.
the d2 iso 400 images have a not unappealling noise level, like film grain.
dan john falkenstine , june 06, 2004; 03:13 p.m. the camera reminds me strongly of english cars of years gone by...rationalization is required to oversee the fact that its an overpriced, outdated dud.
other flashes with safe trigger voltages can be used, but must depend on their built-in automation rather than ttl.
it's late to the digital dinner table, its offerings are nothing special.
i've bought mine in april 2004 and till that date, had only found one single review which was good, but focused a bit on the good side.
under an average ceiling, once you get closer than about 5 feet, the “pool” of bounced light is directly above, or even behind, your subject.
not only can you set them with the power off, you can set two or three things simultaneously: left hand setting focus or aperture or focal length while the right hand is thumbing on the power and setting the shutter or meter pattern.
i luckily purchased my d2 in april from a seller who included a 69mm panasonic mc filter (as well as a panasonic remote release and sandisk ultra ii sd card for cheap).
landrum kelly , june 11, 2005; 07:50 a.m. to juan morino: you may have the dough to buy a rolex, but if you think that a camera with the capacity to save one (1) raw file at a time is the photographic equivalent of a rolex, then by all means spread the wealth around.
there is now a new version with interchangeable lenses or the new m8, beyond my range today but if i hadn't bought the d200 i would be an m8 sort of guy, so there, bugger me but leica is good.
with two rings side-by-side on the lens, it is simple and fast to change focal lengths and click between manual and autofocus without taking my hand off the lens or the camera away from my eye.
as with all digital zooms, it simply magnifies the image from the middle of the sensor, without gathering any more detail.
if the d2 is disappointing in quality, then leica will have much to lose.
the leather treatment was done by cameraleather.com and the bags by m-classics.com.
neither viewfinder is especially good for critical evaluation of exposure, color, or sharpness.
essentially useless for anything other than 4x6 prints or video, imho - and at 3x, don’t expect to use the resulting images to prove you actually saw “bigfoot” or “nessie”.
also, it's hard for a dslr to take shots in low light with as much dof.
while i make my living shooting with canon kit, my digilux 2(s) are never out of reach.
due to the meter’s habit of protecting the highlights, changing the contrast when using autoexposure has the effect of lightening or darkening the shadows - moving only the left end of the histogram.
you can compare the effect with a 400 or 800 iso film at the 35mm format.
image capturing where what i see is what i get, not what a camera/computer interprets.
well, after reading this excellent review and all its critics, i still went and bought the d2 for $1279 including tax and s/h. i could buy the panasonic version or even a nikon d-70 for much less, but i decided to purchase a leica d2, and i will tell you guys the reason why: the same reason i bought a rolex watch instead of a seiko or a timex: even thought the seiko or the timex watch offer better features than a rolex and they are even more precise...a rolex is a rolex.
the d2 iso 400 images have a not unappealling noise level, like film grain.
this has great benefits for right-eyed photographers: you don’t have to balance the camera on the tip of your nose (firmer support), people can see your face while you’re shooting (a good way to establish and maintain trust), and, in the case of the digilux, you aren’t constantly planting nose-grease on the rear lcd.
i do not have a lot of time to sit at a computer and use programs like photo shop (i lack the computer skills anyway.)being that i travel quite a bit in my work.
p.m. i find the most interesting part of the review is the fact that there is a tutorial on how to take acceptable iso 400 images (that circumvent the in-built shortcomings) with a 1300 uk pound camera.
the digilux 2 or can i say panasonic lc1.... is a great camera.
since people vary, there is no perfect size and weight for a camera.
i would have liked custom settings as in some other digicams where i would combine b&w/raw/iso400 as well as a-color/jpg/iso100, etc.
occasionally the focus would shift a bit when turning the aperture ring.
hell with a setup like this they could even make a new digital mount for lenses designed with digital cameras in mind.
shooting at ei 100, manually white balancing, adjusting the white balance as far to the blue side as possible, and being generous with exposure (+1 ev) will boost the blue exposure to a reasonable level - pictures still need some photoshop work to fix color balance and saturation, but at least the blue channel contains detail.
i use both dslrs, the d2 and film cameras (35mm, medium format and large format) in my business.
if you change the colour-management than you change automatically other settings or if you reduce the noise it could be that the images will not have the typical leica sharpness.
in accordance with german business law, banks have frozen some credit lines because leica expects a big loss for 2004-05 (euros 10 million against assets of euros 83 million), and the banks want to know how leica plans to stem the losses (to be revealed in a stockholders' meeting may 1).
leica followed this design in all later models and although modern lenses could not be collapsed, the design reminded functional and the styling great.
no pc outlet - you’d need some kind of adapter (radio, slave) for work with studio strobes.
the only redeeming factor i can see in this overpriced, outperformed dinosaur is its lens, which appears to be fabulous (as are all leica lenses).
as told in the review, i could have bought the lumix lc-1, but i live in brasil and there's no authorized lumix dealear that sells that model.
the shutter dial rotation is oriented to match a leica m6ttl or m7, rather than the ‘opposite’ design of older leicas or the mp.
if you don’t nail exposure, white balance, saturation and contrast in the camera, and have to start making major corrections in post-processing, they can fall apart rather quickly.
bottom line for me is that the d2 has let me get photographs in situations when i would not have otherwise gotten them with other available equipment.
judging from the review, the camera will cover my need for great pictures while still retaining the basic feel of my m-6.
this is probably as good a place as any to say that i did not buy the digilux 2 for the leica nameplate.
the digilux 2 is limited to an 8-second maximum exposure time, and uses a ‘dark-frame’ second exposure to map and subdue ‘hot’ pixels.
the manual setting also tends to run a bit on the yellow side.
if its resale value holds up when the inevitable 10mp version arrives then the initial cost of the d2 may be acceptable.
i won’t go into all the possible menus that can be brought up on the screens - every possible control from setting the internal clock/calendar to choosing how many prints to order.
------- "leica ist kaputt" now going into receivership as credit has been withdrawn from the company.
it looks like the time has finally arrived to buy my first digital camera although i will feel guilty about leaving my m-6 behind.
same concept applies to exotic cars, timepieces, and other fine items - there are always cheaper and high quality items available.
in the d2-only examples, the pixels are 100% as they came from the camera unless noted otherwise.)
the better price and included accessories made the decision for me.
the colors are very good!
note especially the faint rays in the top of the label - erased in the 200/400 exposures, retained in the “pushed” iso 100 shots.
using iso 100 and a high shutter speed, this left me shooting at f/2.4 while trying to focus at f/5.6 (the reverse of an slr, where you focus at f/1.4 and shoot at f/5.6).
but i was surprised how good that camera performs regarding image quality compared to the leica m6 with the 1,4/35mm lens.
the image seen in my computer's monitor is way better, but my eyes are learning to see the real photo through the lcd.
i have use one digilux2 and 4 panasonic lc1, there were all sold, but i just miss the camera so much, and also bought one 2nd few days ago.
i would not give up any of its attributes to obtain a bigger ccd and modest image quality gain.
we’ll use the digilux 2, and a couple of other popular digicams, the canon g5 and the sony 828, which i tested at the local electronics-appliance store.
the lcd quality is very good.
in the resulting snaps, i marked how far the car bumpers had moved by the time the shutter actually exposed the picture.
this, of course, is due to handheld photography and varying light conditions; however, when i have taken similar photos with a 35mm contax slr with 100 speed film, almost all photos were tack sharp.
it seems to me to offer 28/35/50mm summicrons, 90mm elmarit, and 28-35-50 tri-elmar lenses all rolled into one.
and when the final pictures are this clear and detailed, the fact that the viewfinder image is grainy becomes a minor issue.
does a great job at removing noise.
the photos you get with the leica/panasonic really are special.
nonetheless it will have its fans.
i shot jpeg before i discovered raw and posted shots to my blog at kiwicafe.com.
purchasing from these stores via these links helps support photo.net.
in fact, there have been times when i've set up for a shot by feel alone, without even looking at the camera controls.
if i had to name one aspect of the camera which most needed improvement, it would be one which was expressed earlier by s.g., namely, the focusing.
except that i've quit shooting slow color film.
i've been the second brazillian to get a digilux 2 in the authorized leica dealer.
it pins the brightest pixels to about a level of 245-248 on the histogram, preventing burned-out whites.
though my 20d is probably technically superior, the leica sees far more playing time.
the most obvious one is to shoot raw files, which bypass all “in-camera” firmware processing, and thus the noise supression.
and it mostly affects the lighter tones, whereas the strongest noise is in the shadows.
and i will still have the analog controls, comfortable ergonomics, and really impressive leica lens to keep using forever - or what passes for “forever” in the world of digital photography.
in my opinion this camera will probably not do well for the leica legend of excellence.
at “90mm”-f/2.4 the image starts to degrade visibly within 1.5 inches either side of correct focus.
i have a 18-50mm sigma dc zoom lens, compact and designed for aps sized sensors, barely larger than the 50mm 1.8 prime.
at the end of the day, it is decision of personal preferences and style.
on many occasions i have used the camera only to find that the af mode has slipped into the macro mode in error.
nice crisp clear “iso 400” pictures.
personally, i love wide (my main film lens is a 21mm) - so i found this a pleasant surprise.
the dark-frame exposure is not user-adjustable, and kicks in at 1/2 second - which snuck up on me a couple of times when i was making hand-held 1/2-sec.
the large lovely lcd makes up in good measure for the deficiencies of the evf.
we tried to get a perfect colour management, sharpness and contrast but it is impossible to avoid completely noise....
so now that i have mentioned my new venturing into digital slr territory, i will satisfy the curious about which model of dslr i purchased.
- bottomline was that i was perhaps happy with just 5% of the results, which is not what i would expect from such an expensive camera.
left-eyed shooters end up the same place they do with most camera designs - out in the cold.
so i’ve already recovered more than the leica/panasonic price difference.
same concept applies to exotic cars, timepieces, and other fine items - there are always cheaper and high quality items available.
the d2 is also missing the power-on led of the lc1.
using leica digilux-2 jpeg mode, no editing, 50% scaled.
the spot af also did not always seem to find the targeted spot.
it might not be as easy to throw a background out of focus but you won't get blurry photographs like those taken with some dslrs with fast heavy lenses attached.
camera is small enough where people don't get intimated.
it looks like the time has finally arrived to buy my first digital camera although i will feel guilty about leaving my m-6 behind.
i shot jpeg before i discovered raw and posted shots to my blog at kiwicafe.com.
there's a sucker born every minute, not to mention two con men ready to take advantage of him.
but hey, i guess i just wouldn't look as cool walking around with my canon as i would with a leica!
lines mark the actual bumper positions, the arrows mark the average for each group.
otherwise i save my editing for the computer monitor, where the images are generally sharper, warmer, and darker than the camera displays them.
here are the key points of their response, edited for space: “some noise at iso 400 is not unusual for digital cameras.
at 90mm - no distortion i could measure, occasional purple fringing in dark objects against the sky, very low vignetting (looks like about 1/2 stop at its worst).
so you might save by buying cheap in the first place, but will end up paying for it in the end!
combine these with it's well placed controls a seasoned photographer would feel immediately comfortable using, and the digilux 2 is without comparison in the digital realm.
the meter can be set to center-weighted, spot metering, and “multi-area” patterns.
being able to see the image prior to taking the shot, and not just an authopsy of the picture taken as with any dslr, is really a bonus i didn't expect.
this business of dogging the d2 for its weaknesses is akin to saying that my deardorff 8x10 is no good because it cannot be hand-held, or that a hasselblad is no good because its lenses aren't as fast as a 35mm or dslr.
so that flipping the shoot/review lever automatically switches you to your preferred viewfinder with one motion.
the lag time finally closes the books.
at the end of the day, it is decision of personal preferences and style.
if you bring a "bag of lenses", it's only because you want to, not because you have to, for crying out loud.
then when they fix the issue with w/a lenses they could have the new cameras use a mount that accepts both lenses, even if the m lenses needed an adaptor (kinda like the m can use screw mount lenses via an adaptor).
i hear that one can visualize and shoot b&w in raw mode and retain the option of color images later using the raw file.
all of which gets you to the important thing - pushing the shutter release - in the shortest time possible.
the leica-designed lens is almost supernatural in its ability to define details and separate tones and colors, and pushes right to the limits of what 5 megapixels can record - a bonus i wasn’t even expecting.
altho it has more versatility.
excessive noise reduction in iso 200/400 jpegs when shooting jpegs at iso 200/400, the digilux 2 employs a rather heavy-handed noise reduction routine.
the bulk is just inside the large end of my comfort zone - about the same as a small motor-incorporated film slr (nikon n/f80, contax aria).
if you are unwilling to pay that price go for the sony/kodak/etc but you don't need to criticize leica cameras as not worth it.
and water reflecting sky, or sky-lit shadows/shade, are rendered as cyan-blue, not purple-blue.
in others words - it was the high-quality lines with the "good name" that went into the tank - and it's the so-called "junk" digilux 2 that's saved leica's bacon - or at least slowed the decline.
i also compared the images and musings visible on the forums for the various 8 megapixel offerings, such as the minolta a2, the olympus c-8080 and the canon powershot pro1.

each foot of movement thus equals about 33.3 milliseconds.
image quality depends from the adjustments (colour, contrast, noise, sharpness).
if you don’t nail exposure, white balance, saturation and contrast in the camera, and have to start making major corrections in post-processing, they can fall apart rather quickly.
at focal lengths above “50mm”, autofocus is usually fastest (the af lock time is about 1 second).
it's a tool which does nothing perfectly, but most things well.
with the m6 (which has a known shutter lag of about 20 milliseconds), the average total distance traveled was 7 feet.
leica had a gain of 40% in income from sales of compact cameras - which includes the digilux 2.
graham welland , june 07, 2004; 04:55 a.m. thanks for a balanced review that actually gave me some valuable user advice (iso 400 shooting technique).
people always amazed the photo's were taken by this old and only 5mg pix camera.
the money i saved will go towards a leica mp body.
if you get past these and are still interested, then we can have fun with the camera’s good side - which is occasionally amazing.
so now that i have mentioned my new venturing into digital slr territory, i will satisfy the curious about which model of dslr i purchased.
it’s possible to dial up one of three “hollywood” shutter sounds (“clack”, “click”, or “cluck”) that play when you fire the shutter.
i hoped wistfully for a camera that could come close to scans from iso 100 slide films.
i've used dslrs and other digicams, but this is the first digital camera which i enjoy using and find myself wanting to use.
i've got a rolleyflex from a friend for some time and was realy interested in seeing the picture that would be taken on the unpolished glass.
not only can you set them with the power off, you can set two or three things simultaneously: left hand setting focus or aperture or focal length while the right hand is thumbing on the power and setting the shutter or meter pattern.
------- "leica ist kaputt" now going into receivership as credit has been withdrawn from the company.
set the shutter dial to “a”, and the camera will choose the shutter speed as you change apertures.
i don't like menus and not in your face composition of viewscreens or bulk of the high quality systems.
there is a separate “flash” white-balance setting to compensate for the coolish color of the flashtube.
so far as i can tell, the digilux has about every possible flash capability generally available - normal sync up to 1/2000th second (yes, 3 zeroes is correct!); slow-speed sync; sync at the beginning or end of the exposure (i refuse to call it “second-curtain-sync” when the camera has no shutter curtains); flash exposure compensation of +/- 2 stops for fill.
i use all the camera’s focusing modes, depending on the situation.
the leica m6s live on b&w and the once-a-year roll of 400 color - the digilux gets the rest.
really looking forward to the digital back for the leica slr coming this fall - as a preview for how the digital m will perform.
s g , july 28, 2004; 03:45 p.m. after my earlier comments (see above), i actually did purchase a digilux 2, tried it for 2 weeks and then returned it.
the glove test just for grins, i put on a heavy set of ragg-wool gloves and tried operating the digilux.
though my 20d is probably technically superior, the leica sees far more playing time.
so - you can shoot fast, or you can shoot raw.
you don't need an external flash to get shots that look like they were taken in daylight (fantastic bounce flash feature).
at 4x, the magnified view appears in a box within the full-frame image, which supposedly allows one to keep track of the overall picture while focusing.
here are the key points of their response, edited for space: “some noise at iso 400 is not unusual for digital cameras.
with two rings side-by-side on the lens, it is simple and fast to change focal lengths and click between manual and autofocus without taking my hand off the lens or the camera away from my eye.
the much larger variation for the m6 is interesting, and could be due to the mechanical linkage-chain in the shutter.
you don't need an external flash to get shots that look like they were taken in daylight (fantastic bounce flash feature).
i like the compact, grippable ergonomics.
1) some d2/lc-1s apparently have poorly aligned sensors, so that pictures shot at "infinity" or elsewhere on the focusing ring are not actually focused there.
in accordance with german business law, banks have frozen some credit lines because leica expects a big loss for 2004-05 (euros 10 million against assets of euros 83 million), and the banks want to know how leica plans to stem the losses (to be revealed in a stockholders' meeting may 1).
three levels of picture information can be displayed in the single picture/1x view: nothing but the image; basic picture info (frame number, date/time of exposure, file size/type); and the basics plus detailed exposure info (histogram, aperture/shutter speed, metering mode, etc.).
i, for one, would like to state that i will buy this camera for the leica brandname and the accompanying legend and quality.
each foot of movement thus equals about 33.3 milliseconds.
turn-on lag time let’s turn on the camera and set the lens to 6 feet for a quick “scale-focused” street photography grab shot.
when shooting jpegs at iso 200/400, the digilux 2 employs a rather heavy-handed noise reduction routine.
i have a 18-50mm sigma dc zoom lens, compact and designed for aps sized sensors, barely larger than the 50mm 1.8 prime.
in other words, leica did not design the lumix lenses at all, let alone manufacturing them.
what failed to satisfy after almost half a year of daily use, was the frequent presence of noise, even in images that had been brightly lit at the time of exposure.
even louis daguerre would recognize it as a camera.
you can tell if you missed the moment, or if the exposure or focus were really off.
i took a low light shot of a band and a large crowd all inside a tent that came out amazing.
if nikon or canon or minolta had produced a camera as ‘manual’ as the digilux 2, i would have bought nikon/equipment/canon/minolta - whichever came first.
my street shooting style is to hold the camera to eyelevel for the briefest amount of time to frame the shot so the quality of the evf image is less important.
it is very easy to get less-than-sharp pictures even at the “28mm” setting if you don’t focus carefully.
three levels of picture information can be displayed in the single picture/1x view: nothing but the image; basic picture info (frame number, date/time of exposure, file size/type); and the basics plus detailed exposure info (histogram, aperture/shutter speed, metering mode, etc.).
i have never been able to adapt to gadget cameras very well.
i don't exactly see folks standing in line to buy the company, and there's a reason for that..soon it might be much, much cheaper to buy leica.. juan monino , may 23, 2005; 02:08 p.m.
and so time marches on, the older i get the less i am prepared to buy crap, no more nikon, my digilux2 has converted me to leica big time, now i have the d2 and also an m8 with 3 lenses.
i love it and it really changed my way of photographing.
really looking forward to the digital back for the leica slr coming this fall - as a preview for how the digital m will perform.
on many occasions i have used the camera only to find that the af mode has slipped into the macro mode in error.
it’s scary when you open a color image and all the grays have identical amounts of rgb - 160/161/160 or 120/119/120 or the like.
prices on the digilux are already tumbling=no buyers.
the shutter dial rotation is oriented to match a leica m6ttl or m7, rather than the ‘opposite’ design of older leicas or the mp.
the lance is really very good quality, see what it does to the 5mg iq, i really don't know what to complain about.
it is much easier to visualize real-time b&w on the lcd screen compared to the dslr's always-in-color viewfinder.
as a photojournalist, i’d rather shoot jpegs anyway, as much for the time savings at the computer after the fact as those during shooting.
as for the slow raw processing without a built-in buffer, i use the raw mode primarily for stills and scenics, and so the slow processing means nothing, since i shoot with a tripod and the cable release (remote), and take my time.
"making junk and hoping the good name will obfuscate that its junk just doesn't work in the technology world.
judging from the review, the camera will cover my need for great pictures while still retaining the basic feel of my m-6.
i “gelled” my flash for that warm “sunset light” look, and to balance with tungsten lights indoors, by the simple expedient of coloring a piece of translucent office tape with an orange marker and sticking it on the front.
the camera is still much happier with full-spectrum light (daylight, flash or blue photofloods).
remote: the remote cable threaded down my shirt sleeve and switch in left hand combined with 1930's aufsu waist level finder makes a very stealthy outfit.
i have yet to see the perfect camera for all situations.
at 90mm - no distortion i could measure, occasional purple fringing in dark objects against the sky, very low vignetting (looks like about 1/2 stop at its worst).
i've probably taken about 1200 shots with it so far, and find that's it's pretty easy to use once you get acclimated to its setup.
the lens was collapsible, making the camera wonderfully pocketable.
no other digicam has a lens this valuable and leica is renown for premium quality premium priced optics.
it's not hard to learn, as you'll only be using a small portion of all that photoshop was designed to do, but once there, you'll love the things that you can do that you could never do in traditional silver/dye photography - regional contrast control, manipulation of particular colors within the image, etc.
maybe so, maybe... it is interesting to note that despite the high level of manual operation available with this camera, even when the aperture ring is turned to the f/2 setting, that the user is very often comprimised [forced] by the camera into accepting a f/2.4 aperture rating.
the leica digilux 2 - a review photo.net nikon editor shun cheung reviews the new nikon j1 camera system.
but at least the country club set will no longer have to be embarrassed hauling around a canon, nikon or ugh--- hp.
at 4 feet and f/2 there is clear softening of the image from peak performance within 4 inches either side of correct focus.
zooming in to 90mm to set focus and then zooming out for framing also works well.
it can't shoot real macro, or sports or vr zooms or 300mm f2.8 teles.
maybe some of the details of the film image are not visible on the web, but overall, having seen these comparison photos, i am asking myself why spending thousands of dollars for the leica m6 lenses if that digital camera can do it almost better.
but my digilux took a 3-foot fall out of my camera bag onto carpeted concrete the first night i had it, and survived with no marks or damage.
under an average ceiling, once you get closer than about 5 feet, the “pool” of bounced light is directly above, or even behind, your subject.
i bought it with the 18-70mm kit lens, and have purchased a few other lenses and filters to round out the package.
i do wish that the on/off switch was in the locaton of the meter pattern switch and vice versa since all my nikons have the power switch around the shutter release button.
they have always been somewhat confusing for me and seemed to take away most of the personal touch in photography.
even at “90mm” and with the magnification turned on, the dof was so wide that an “infinity” subject still looked sharp with the lens set as close as 4 feet - a recipe for fuzzy pictures.
i think it's a great camera that takes very good photos.
the most basic shows you nothing but the image and the af ‘box’ - until you touch the shutter button, at which point the aperture and shutter speed appear, along with a “match-needle” scale if you’re setting exposure manually.
i own these lenses and when i need them i happily pull out my dslr.
so that flipping the shoot/review lever automatically switches you to your preferred viewfinder with one motion.
i predict that it will have a very short life.
the technical theorising concerned the speed and range of the lens, i.e. f/2 was faster than any other digicam offering and i was happy that the 28-90mm could provide a general purpose range for what might be termed as a 'normalised' field of view.
i think leica completly missed the boat.
in that case i put my left hand in front of the flash to bounce the light more vertically and off a nearby wall behind me (i've only tried this so far in b&w to avoid potential color casts).
the d2 lens is worth a fortune in equivalent leica m glass.
and so time marches on, the older i get the less i am prepared to buy crap, no more nikon, my digilux2 has converted me to leica big time, now i have the d2 and also an m8 with 3 lenses.
at 8x, the magnified area fills the screen.
on the digilux: total time to “ready to shoot” - turn on the camera and set 6 feet on the lens’s analog scale - 2.7 seconds
press a button on the back once, and the flash head pops up to a 60-degree angle for bounce flash.
i haven't yet gone to the trouble of acquiring in raw partially because the quality of the .jpg's is for me quite good.
purchasing from these stores via these links helps support photo.net.
i immediately turned this off, since i am far more interested in the next picture than the one i've already taken.
the manual controls, quick start-up, and short shutter lag simply outperform anything less than an slr (and even a few of those) when it comes to fast work on the street, or wherever the action is.
with its centered lens, it is easier to hold, and much easier to hold steady, than the “l” shape used for most other top-end digicams, because the left palm has a corner to provide mutual support, instead of thin air.
the shutter lag on the digilux 2 is pretty minimal, but the viewfinder lag has cost me ‘moments’.
from the point of view of the company?s board of management, these facts prove leica?s ability to offer attractive digital solutions.
the actual blue channel looks like a kodalith image of out-of-focus oatmeal - no fine details, no tonality.
there is one bug using manual exposure in this view: the needle and numerical readouts won’t change in real time as you change apertures or shutter speeds.
the iso 400 images are the best in its size class.
i don't hear much bashing of 35mm image quality compared to 6x6 or 4x5 formats because everyone recognizes that different film format sizes have different trade-offs.
