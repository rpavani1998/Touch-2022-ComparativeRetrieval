i think a larger one could've possibly been placed inside not only to cope with the inherent noise that'll inevitably come with a higher resolution, but also because more detail will be recorded in the image and impress more people.for those of you who enjoy doing it yourself, the canon powershot g10 offers manual focus and it's enabled by pressing the up button on the d-pad.obviously this causes problems with a narrow depth of field but using a smaller f/18 or similar aperture would give longer exposures unless the iso is cranked up.this equates to around 153,666 pixels and means more detail can be seen in playback and when monitoring for manual focus or noise detection.the new technology is an added bonus with the dig!c iv processor speeding things up while the face detection self timer will help those of you specialising in self portraits.specification at Â£421, the canon powershot g10 offers a 5x optical zoom, external hotshoe, optical viewfinder and raw recording.another problem gained from such close focusing is the lack of light entering the lens.setting the camera up in the same way as a normal self portrait with the timer, it takes a photograph two seconds after it detects a new face in the frame.in contrast, the main menu goes more indepth allowing you to make changes to features such as the af flexizone which allows you to manipulate the focus area and is a useful feature for photographers who enjoy focus stacking.using a burst of flash has helped warm the image back up and added some much needed catchlights to the eyes.it can also be moved around the frame for off-centre focusing.at the launch of the canon powershot g10, i was told by one of the technical departments henchmen that the 5x optical zoom can be increased by simply adjusting the resolution of the camera.in this instance it has forced the camera to open the aperture to f/2.8 in order to expose correctly.the addition of the bracketing dial on the top plate will help with quicker, more varied exposures as well as hdr fans.the reason that it chose this aperture value is so it could use iso80 to give as smooth an image as possible.
