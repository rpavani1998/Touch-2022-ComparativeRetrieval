nikon’s camera’s seemed to be a lot slower, perhaps they gave more options to edit where the canon’s quality is simply in image and their product and they allow the user to edit on the computer.i also find the colour saturation better with nikon & it reproduces black with less ‘blocking’.my next body will be nikon as i believe they have better colour definition and dynamic range.it is also important for those that do compare the 2 brands to make sure that they compare cameras that are on the same level otherwise the results will be misleading.canon is the clear winner in the sales category, but while the massive sales volume tips the scales in its favour, it has no effect on camera users’ opinion on both brands, with nikon only just ekeing out a win in the popularity contest.it has a special affinity for the 80-400vr lens and also works very well with the 18-200vr.they compete so heavily against each other in the same market that if one really were the best, the other would have gone out of business long ago.nikon is much more aggressive in its marketing approach in sa than canon.nikon may lead canon sales in one area and vice versa in another.although it is quite old now and ‘only’ has 6 megapixels, the sensor is something special with great colours and low noise for its age.nikon gives a free high quality photography course when you buy one of their cameras.some claim nikon has better lenses, but they are more expensive, but i think a more accurate statement would be that canon covers a wider range of lenses, therefore some canon users choose to buy the cheaper options, but they have lenses just as good as the nikon ones.i just wish printing photographs was more simple now as i find the machines at camera printing shops either crop one’s photo on their own accord and just seem too problematic.there is not much between the two brands, as the experts believe that both cameras are deservedly good at an average of 8.7 for canon and 8.6 for nikon.since my first camera almost 30 years ago i have always and only used nikon and have alway believed in nikon.
