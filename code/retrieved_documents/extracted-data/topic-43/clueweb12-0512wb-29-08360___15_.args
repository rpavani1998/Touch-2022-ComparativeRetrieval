it also has a great depth of controls and features, so you can tailor it to your needs and preferences, and i’ve done a3 prints from it with stunning quality.pictures are sharp as a razor and color is more than perfect.sony movies are fine in mpeg format, the eaze of the sony makes it a far better choice but if you want quality of image the nikon of course is the better choice.the avi the nikon takes is extremely sharp, like a high end movie camera so in that aspect it is better than the sony but that is the only advantage.the nikon needs several buttons to start the movie and they are on the back of the camera making manipulation of movie start and stop a chore that could easily, way too easily mess up start and stop portion of the movie.if you use the nikon file type you can use their software to manipulate the picture, but a good jpg picture program, and there are many even free ones, that will do an excellent job of the same basic thing so nikon format is not needed.especially all the camera dealers, established & authorized camera dealers are 200% friendly, pleasant & enterprising persons.it just always performs and is completely intuitive to use.all my photos are saved on a dedicated hard drive partition and down loaded directly from the camera soon after the shots.any fish eye will distort the image but this one does not do a terrible job of it leaving the picture as is with distortion all but beyond notice.the nikon uses sd flash cards for storage which is fast and no moving parts.again, the sony is best for the amature and the nikon is for the pro where it has all the stuff in a camera a pro will need.the only feature i’ve ‘missed’ is a more advanced af (like the d300’s 51-point af system) to help with tracking fast-moving wildlife, but that’s on 1% of the time.this is pretty much a good all 'round lens but others are definately needed for more cultured shots.for more professional, accurate and detailed shots the nikon takes that one.
