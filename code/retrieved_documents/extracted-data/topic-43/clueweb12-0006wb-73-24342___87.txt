ok...for a photojournalist, a sport phtographer, a reporter like for a "common user" a digital vs. film question simply makes no sense.
in my humble opinion, it is not the equipment  or the media it is the art, the composition, inspiration and good light that  makes a good picture.
i'll have to bring (perhaps even legally) that case to their  marketting dpt as 3000 euros is quiet an investement, even for a professional.
yes, canon can do 14bit ad  conversion, but if the pixel picks up only nosier data at first hand, more  resolution in the ad stage simply won't help much - (amplifying the noise)?
the canon 17mm-40mm f4 lens works beautifuly with the 5d and if you want the f2.8 then try the canon 24mm-70mm pro lens.
but nonetheless the 5d is still probably the most affordable full frame around.
a little consideration more: the hasselblad h3d-22 (that's a heavy medium format bazooka) has a 4080x5440 square format sensor that produce a 22mpx file or, in print-size terms, a 13x18 print.
as a keen amateur for 25 years, i've owned a 5d for almost a year now and continue to be wowed by the results it yields, with, like any camera, a discerning eye, a sensitivity for the subject matter and a sense of imagination...
why can't canon make a wide angle zoom as good as nikon's 17-35 2.8?
there is a pc connector on the side for studio strobes.
so far there is no firmware update to correct this.
to be perfectly honest, if you were a person that was extremely well versed in the digital tools, your ability to manipulate a photograph for artistic purposes is, and to "tweak" a photograph is so much greater than that if film.
there are few industries as heart-wrenching as the fine art business.
before digital, i had to pay to have the negatives developed and the  photos printed--the good ones and the bad ones!
article revised february 2011.
like me, they have taken the time and effort to understand, for example, what a colour space is and whether a device uses an rgb or cymk model.

i then went to a local camera store and had the sales person recreate a backlit situation in store with the same results.
just great for reportage, especially in  low light situations.
also,  compared to film the quality wasn't even close!
aside from all my rambling though, the 5d is definately the best digital  camera out there!
what specifically is the effect you are talking about?
01:56 p.m. definitely go for it!
nikon's build quality  and ergronomics are way ahead of canon's.
i received my 5d for xmass this year.
i'm wondering if anyone else is having this problem.
i had own my own photo business which i closed about  the time i converted to digital in 2003.
i have not been able to resolve this  megapixel issue in my head i.e what is an acceptable minimum?
the canon eos 5d has been replaced by the canon eos 5d mark ii, (compare prices) (review), and it might be more worth  your money to purchase the current version.
i perfectly understand all these older guys that shot film for years and  years all of a sudden going, "wow i can do this with this new thing and
i am sure you will enjoy your eos3.
03:13 a.m. i started out with pen and ink, moved to pastels, charcoal, watercolor airbrushing.
ranging from $2500-3500.
contributed content used  with permission.
the difference is that  you can shoot 5000 images in one day with out spending $7000 dollars on film  and carrying around a 100 pound duffle bag full of film.
they are now approaching what i use to produce  with my film camera.
a little over sampling and sharpening seems to make  a very nice print at 13x19.
there are remedies for this, similar to shooting 35mm  film with a wide angle lens.
the 5d does not shoot at the blazing speeds of the newest canon dslr, but at present neither nikon nor anyone else has a digital camera with the kind of speed the 1d mark iii does.
to make a  very long story short: both fuji and canon have their strengths, the canon with  the right converter for raw (i prefer canons own one) can produce quite nice  looking results, sharp, low noise etc.
and, that there are no plans for an  upgrade or the inevertable 3d.
sensitivity is adjustable from iso 50-3200 but there is no good reminder of what you've got set and the setting is persistent if you turn the camera off and back on overnight.
dedicated canon accessory flash units mount in the hot shoe above the viewfinder and the camera is able to control flash exposure via a through-the-lens sensor.
but much more important than resouloution is the amount of contrast that you can record.
the daunting nature of the processes involved in film would explain (along with relative cost) the explosion of new digital users.
after you have felt the full impact of the above  photo, go read bob atkins'preview of the canon 1d mark iii.
you can't be going into the bride and groom's face to lock in an exposure  reading.
it really is a great camera for what i do, mainly  portraiture and some landscape.
if it is not going to be printed bigger than 8x10 or if it is for web use then virtually every digital becomes the same whether it is $150 or $3000.
memory card i can shoot away all day long and statistically speaking i will have a few great images; with film unless i had tons of cash i would have to plan my shots and make decisions on which to take.
vermac santos , march 31, 2007; 07:52 p.m. jonathan, i'm in the same dilemma, thinking about 5d, finepix s5 or simply buy a nikon fisheye for my d200 for my landscape images.
they are  very fast for dslrs.
and i'm very happy about that.
again, my answer is only a guess.
so i am in the same: will continue scanning till they get a product that won't be obsolete in less than five years.
my 20d exposes backlighting perfectly and this camera costs over half as much of a 5d.
canon is a massive company with the $billions to invest in building  semiconductor fabrication lines.
i have much more respect for a photographer who creates a wonderful sunset  image with both the sky and foreground having a good balance of exposure than  someone who merged two images together and created a high dynamic range image.
i've found the review quite irritating for more or less the same  reasons that vincent martin wrote about -despite
(am i making any sense?)
without reading the manual, you can go into the custom function menu and the camera to lock up the mirror before taking a picture (then set self-timer mode on the drive button and the camera automatically configures itself for a 2-second self-timer delay; press the button and the mirror locks up, then the shutter opens two seconds later).
had i not invested a good number of  canon l glasses, i would definitely go for mamiya or nikon d3.
so what's the big deal?
photo processing stores).
imagine all the gold coins and  shillings you would collect!
i still can't get over that 5d viewfinder, though, and that's the one absolutely unavoidable drawback of four thirds - technology improvements and price/size economies mean the smaller sensors will just lag 35mm sensors by two or three years (in resolution and sensitivity), but there's no way with that imaging circle to get abigger viewfinder image than the e1's.
looking back over this entire thread, it is astonishing how emotional  people can get over film v. digital and canon v. nikon, etc.
patty larue , october 28, 2010; 10:20 a.m. i have the canon 5d and have been using with the 70-200 heavy lens for portrait work and weddings can someone please tell me what  other lens to buy to replace this heavy lens for every day before i have to  have surgery my neck can not take it.
i'm saying your argument sounds like someone that hates anything other than film
just looking for some  recommendations from who to buy from for the best price.
get the lcd and autofocusing right!
if you downloadmicrosoft raw image thumbnailer and viewer for windows xp, you can sort photos to some extent just using the standard windows file browser.
my comments have no impact whatsoever on the market image of either canon or nikon.
tom h , october 18, 2006; 09:59 a.m. evita it might be true that if you don't have an eye for shooting  photographs a better camera will not change that.
in some respects, art is the  way one interprets what one perceives and presents that interpretation so  others can experience that expression.
xiaoyuan gu , november 28, 2007; 10:12 a.m. it is time for canon to throw the goodies of 1d mkiii and 40d to a 5d mkii, to seriously compete with the nikon d3.
it certainly depends on the person using the camera and i believe that you need to have the flare and artistic ability to be able to use any camera (including digital) to produce beautiful images.
although i have never shot either, the specs on the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x are very, very impressive.
any advice you have for me would be greatly appreciated.
after much review, i am purchasing the 5d. i think it will be a wonderful brush to paint with.
vincent martin , july 30, 2006; 05:01 a.m. i have read the above and there are a great variety of inputs and some  poinient and timely infomrations.
if you dislike digital for some of the reasons vincent or i have  brought up you can still use a digital camera like a film camera and make a  decision to not use advanced digital editing or decide to not simply hold the  trigger down and take thousands of photos at a location to get a few good ones.
beyond the canon ef 50mm f/1.4
whatever software you choose to use, you won't have to spend too much time  post-processing due to the eos 5d's inclusion of a mercury switch to orient  photos.
in the digital  world, however, what you capture in the camera is what you'll be delivering in  a jpeg file, unless you go into a photo editing program and take the trouble to  crop.

the noise just looks like a bad quality image to me it doesn't give the atmosphere or mood that film grain does.
but i need my lcd to show me exactly  what i'm getting.
the eos 30d and digital rebel are better values.

evita m , october 17, 2006; 03:42 a.m. "digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images " i still think it's the one behind the lens who makes an image terrific or not, the camera itself, whatever camera, just makes a picture.
but somehow, after a few drinks that tasted wierd but have a tequila like effect, i figured that they have some kind of machines were i could use a plastic card to get money out of it.
as a matter of  fact, i print photos not posters most of the time.
there is a difference between art and digital is all that i am saying.
as with all of the great canon eos bodies over the decades, if you drill down into the custom function menus, you can figure out how to make the autoexposure lock button on the back of the camera into a "burst of af" thumb switch while in manual focus mode.
i won't perform any manipulations such as replacing colors or pasting other "non-original" images into the photoa.
jose escobar , may 18, 2007; 02:26 a.m.
just great for reportage, especially in low light situations.
it's always good to hear people getting good cameras for a good price.
that change makes sense.
if someone is prepared to arm themselves with generic photographic  techniques in order to digitally capture the best possible image in front of  the camera, then manipulate that image's properties to produce a work of art,  then surely their efforts and dedication to the photographic art should be  encouraged and commended?
you lose image stabilization, but gain one  f-stop in aperture so you can use higher shutter speeds and the viewfinder will  be brighter.
p.m. i am not an expert.
tom moore , january 25, 2007; 08:35 p.m. i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film.
after 'restoring' them for presentation at my father's 90th birthday,  i found i rather liked the feel of these vintage images and now find myself  trying to make new images look old.
more and more  people are going digital, thus driving down demand and prices for film gear.
even tried my hand at oil.
well, everyone says it's a perfect camera, but...
memory card i can shoot away all day long and statistically speaking i  will have a few great images; with film unless i had tons of cash i would have  to plan my shots and make decisions on which to take.
digicams will all turn to dust but the film cameras  of yesterday will be solid as a rock.
i got two cheap lenses: the ordinary ef 28-90 and a  voigtlander 19-35mm.
janice m , february 19, 2007; 01:29 a.m. brian's question: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot  then then i ever did with film."
if he had not seen the problem, he would not have chosen his words so carefully.
i find myself now with amazing  distortions (ellypses) and the canon pro services recently told me it was the  "inconvenience" of full frame captors.
having taught  photography back in the days when dinosaurs were just crawling out from the  sea, i think 'wet' photography will be with us for a long time just as oil on  canvas is still here.
thanks, david beren patterson , march 12, 2007; 02:32 a.m. i'm hanging out for the 5d mark ii!
the 24-70/2.8l lens (mostly from the robinson r44): the  70-200/2.8l lens: bob atkins review of the eos 5d footnote: what happens when you hand the camera to someone else? one perceived problem with professional-grade cameras is that they can't  be used by novices.
on the lcd skintones look washed out, the  finally result on my laptop looked fine
i have used a canon 1ds mark i and ii and i found the quality to be  excellent.
the only thing that worked was when the  salesman used spot metering on the subject's face by going up in his face to  lock in the exposure.
you cannot use those mediums in the same way yet you have what  is called a 'painting' in the end.
i  had considered getting a 30d with the es-f 10-22mm zoom, which has been  reported to be a great combination for landscape and architecture photography,
when using digital you need to 'think' digital.
the following images were taken at iso 800: the included lith-ion battery is adequate for a day of active photography, somewhere between 300 and 500 photos plus review.
however, whilst there are many happy-snappers  out there, who go from low resolution jpeg straight to printer, without so much  as a mention of photoshop or the like, there are also photographers, amateur  and professional, who are increasingly learning to understand and use the  digital medium to great effect.
so, my procedure was the following: 1.
if the 5d is a tough as my 30d i will be well pleased.
i agree it would be nice to have the price of canon l series drop.
this sounds great and indeed would be great on a film camera where slide mounts and cropping during enlargement often result in the sacrifice of some of the image at the edges.
incredible photos, i have no more need for film.
but hey, you got to pay the bills right?
if you are a workhorse photographer, that is you are commercial, then you  have things like time and money to worry about, and you need to find the best  and most efficient and inexpensive tool for the job.
that is a bold statement, but having bought the very same  printer myself and seeing the results from images taken with my 5d, i can  understand his claim.
at least 3 of the first five pictures are having some exposure issues,  and the first one is obviously the worst.
i will go digital when they make the first 1,000,000 dollar
digital allows photographers to experiment and create images with the camera in a way that is much too expensive for most people to do with film.
about the only reason i can see to ante up the extra money and haul  around the added weight of the 70-200mm f/2.8l would be if one routinely takes  action pictures in low light or if one is obsessively enamored of blurry  backgrounds.
that is a rough rounded-off number and a rough way of  getting the point across, but it works as very good shorthand in practice when  deciding on a lens--and when writing reviews for a general audience.
i just wonder whether the 'dust magnet' issue will come back to haunt me further down the line.

nedine o'brien , february 27, 2007; 06:21 a.m. greetings all, i've only been studying photography for three years and started doing b&w film in a wet darkroom.
i have come to really enjoy photogarphy as an artform.
i was not sure what you meant by "effect".
in digital, you have to master the craft of working with tools that are intangible, and exist in the realm of mathematics (1's, and 0's).
i have used a canon 1ds mark i and ii and i found the quality to be excellent.
the 30d got jerked off a folding table and hit a concrete  floor and bounced first on one corner, next on the lens shade, and finally on  it's back.
dynamic range while ok in the 5d is not as good as the s3 pro (and now the s5).
wow, we are in the early stages of digital photography, think how people will see early digital as oldskool and cool, a footprint of our current age.
i still don't enjoy the digital darkroom  that much
tom moore , january 25, 2007; 08:35 p.m. i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with  film.
its hard to find real photographers now as anyone with a  fairly good digital is now branding themselves as pro photographers......
as for the 5d, yes, i believe that it has been worth the hype, in spite of its limitations in terms of speed.
what about film  cameras?
do not complain about high digicam prices.
whatever software you choose to use, you won't have to spend too much time post-processing due to the eos 5d's inclusion of a mercury switch to orient photos.
the "problem" with that image that you have [posted here is not the lens or the camera's problem...
autofocus performance is superb, even in dim light,  with 15 af sensors distributed around the frame.
arguing that shooting film is a more creative process than shooting digital is like saying writing a novel with a pen and ink is more creative than using a typewriter or computer.
for taking pictures of sporting events without breaking your arm, you'll  want acanon ef 300mm f/4l is usm, (compare prices) (review).
the camera can capture 3 frames per second continuously.
all canonusa could do for me was apologize and take down my information.
even a camera like the d40 has a much superior lcd than the 5d.tests say the nikon's vibration reduction system is better than canon's is system.
except the lcd screen.
you  can't keep adjusting your lights and changing your settings.
a good camera  without the right glass is useless too tom antonio (italy) , october 18, 2006; 05:49 p.m. i apologize for bad english grammar in my previous post... pedro p. polakoff iii , october 22, 2006; 03:24
and colin, if you hear anything more about the end of 5d  production, please let us know.
concerning film versus digital: both have advantages, but it is mainly a  very personal question.
i have not thrown away  my watercolors or my 35 mm cameras etc., i have just added to what i enjoy.
i'll be a die hard film fanatic as long as the good men and women at kodak keep cranking out the precious 35mms.
the primary advantages of having a digital sensor the same size (24x36mm)  as a frame of 35mm film are (1) higher image quality, especially in terms of  noise and especially in lower light situations, and (2) the ability to use very  wide angle lenses.
but i have taken a lot of  pictures.
wow, we are in the early  stages of digital photography, think how people will see early digital as  oldskool and cool, a footprint of our current age.
i love the medium format slides in the glassed gepe frames.
such are the relative natures  of well-established and on the other hand, emerging technologies.
he said i should hold off buying it,  because that the next upgrade to the 5d was going to be announced pretty soon,
vincent martin's compelling contribution to this discussion highlights the  superiority of both the quality and professionalism associated with  state-of-the-art film-based work.
the best professional solution isadobe photoshop cs2, which comes with an image editing tool called "adobe bridge".
quico álvarez , december 05, 2007; 06:03 a.m. hi, folks: i am professional, and like that it is not the same to spend $2,000 than $7,000, so i think that my choice should be the eos-5d. the only thing that stops me is not be able to know if this camera's a/d conversion is 12 or 14 bits.
this is one area where the canon eos 1ds justifies its $7000 price with a standard professional 100 percent viewfinder.
as a keen  amateur for 25 years, i've owned a 5d for almost a year now and continue to be  wowed by the results it yields, with, like any camera, a discerning eye, a  sensitivity for the subject matter and a sense of imagination...
this is particularly the case as i like to take a fair number of  wide angle - generally 25mm ( in 35 mm slr speak) to 35mm.
however i know that doing a wedding or journalism is so much simpler with digital.
needless to say i am still using my 20d for demanding shoots, but i am  considering a 1d mark iii or a 1ds mark ii.
there are many settings if you would need them but to many for what i need,i will not need another camera now i have this one what ever canon brings out,mind you if i was a lottery winner,well, say no more !
not unless you want to blow up the image to poster size and then the 13 megapixels of the 5d will be dramatically sharper than the 8 megapixels of the rebel.
so, your max print size will be a great...9,4x14.
regards, bernie jonathan farmer , april 06, 2007; 10:51 a.m. thanks guys for your advice.
you are not asking the design engineers to overcome significant and difficult design compromises by desiging "one wide angle zoom that suits all" etc.
to recharge the battery you must carry a chunky  travel charger that plugs directly into a wall socket.
so for many looking for a full frame caera a used 5d may well  still be a good buy.
one last  thing, i found my 28-80 was not wide enough in some situations for weddings.
i don't know if the 3" lcd will fit onto the back though.
but then i got so many projects going using the "dry"  darkroom in my computer.
and, that there are no plans for an upgrade or the inevertable 3d.
as soon as you scan a negative to digital in order to make an enlargement,  you are losing quality, no matter how good the scanner is.
brandon boghosian , may 26, 2008; 10:55 p.m. alan, the same way hybrid's are killing the suv market.
i'll bring both along with me and use 3 or 4 lenses interchangeably (along with a little lx3 for videos and stereo shots).
i shoot glamour and getting those warm glowing  skintones is paramount.
weather proofing, d o f button on the left(i hate it here, total pain to use with your thumb) i just wish that one camera would do all i want, the closest is the 1d mk3.
sometimes readers, in their emotion, do not read  quite so carefully.
whilst recent advances have  been made in the film domain, they are small and in the future, further  advances are likely to remain small, when compared to the strides that have  been taken in the digital domain in recent years.
cheers robert cudlipp , june 04, 2008; 05:12 a.m. i have a canon 20 d and am very happy with it.
what  you see is what you get.
i would also, obviously, love their to be a  price reduction, but that might be wishful thinking.
digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images and are extremely useful tool for the most common circumstances.
i will never  miss the kodak 14n that it replaced, although i occasionally miss the aperture  rings on my nikon lenses that i had to sell to be able to get both (1) full  frame and (2) low noise at high iso.
if you've pressed the playback button and are  reviewing images, a quick touch of the shutter release readies the camera to  take pictures again.
i have found some really good deals on medium format cameras.
be smart, do the research.
the best digital camera available.?
i understand vincent's viewpoint but we all have different levels of  purism.
the 70-200mm f/4l is a lot cheaper (the f/4l is is cheaper  than the non-is f/2.8l) and a lot lighter (the f/4l is is about half the weight  of the f/2.8l is).
i have a friend that purchased a 40d. he likes the fps but wishes he had purchased the 5d. if you have not used a 5d, perhaps you might borrow or rent one and see if it suits you.
as evita m put it so concisely, the real  magic lies with the person taking the photograph.. and frequently, the luck of  catching a passing moment as it happens.. whether a facial expression or the  momentous interplay of light and landscape.
i enjoyed making  prints in my dark room i did pr, weddings, events, sports, newspaper work,  portraits and even printed some in a couple of other peoples books.
i do,  however, use l lenses which i think more important than a couple of megapixels.
the canon speedlite 580ex ii flash, (compare prices) (review) is canon's current top of the line and it usefully covers an angle as wide as a 14mm lens.
it is a patient studio photographer's camera.
so, please  tell me that canon did some progress in this case in 5d best regards radek buck lovell , july 13, 2007; 05:44 p.m. philip greenspuns very ignorant statement in his review "the  small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses"  bring into question his entire review.
owning a 30d with satisfies me quite well, i must say that i miss the  perspectives of the full frame, 5d is definitely the choice for me.
there is a greenish hue to everything, which is unnerving when you are under the gun on a paid shoot.
i can do in 15 minutes what used to take me all day in the dark room
clients get nervous and models get bored and lose interest, you have to capture the moment or you'll lose the momentum.
patty larue , october 28, 2010; 10:20 a.m. i have the canon 5d and have been using with the 70-200 heavy lens for portrait work and weddings can someone please tell me what other lens to buy to replace this heavy lens for every day before i have to have surgery my neck can not take it.
if you are on the street and would like a  dependable camera that understands you...go nikon.
(the actual conversion factor is going to be about 1.6 for the canon small sensors, and about 1.5 for the nikon sensors, but 1.5 is close enough to be useful in practice for all of them.)
who cares if it is 3000 or  even 10,000.
floyd h , february 28, 2007; 01:14 a.m. lcd screen troubles greetings camera fans, i've had my canon 5d for at least six months and  everything is great
i have read that nikon produce better color and resolution and that many people are sold more on the amount of megapixles than anything else, please see the link below.
i just got everything in the mail today and i am experiencing major  vignetting from this lens.
brian cincotta , february 02, 2007; 04:58 p.m. tom, you made a comment and you said: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever  did with film."
i've suddenly  rediscovered my love of photography.
the remark is also extremely snobbish.
so the only way to frame an image precisely is to take a  test picture, look at the edges on the bright 2.5" rear lcd, and then  recompose and click again.
alan cukurs , october 28, 2007;
if you insist on having a wide-to-tele zoom,  the standard choice is thecanon ef 24-70mm f/2.8l usm, (compare prices) (review ), which is useful for event photography such as wedding receptions.
the 5d takes a single compact flash card, either type i and ii.
i could buy the 1ds mark ii as a backup (kidding!).
you can't keep adjusting your lights and changing your settings.
we have millions of average joe's with an $800 dslr that can produce great quality artistic photos.....and that will obviously blow the ego of anyone who's labored in a darkroom for any amount of time.
heck, the pentax k10d trounces the 40d due solely to its in body anti shake.
i typically am not shooting high speed photography
the 5d, on the other hand, is  better in the following situations: you have a lot of older canon eos lenses that cast a full-frame image you love wide angle photography and want to have a good choice of wide  angle lenses you want to take pictures in low light without a flash you think it is ridiculous to haul around a huge heavy lens designed to  cover the 24x36mm frame of film and then only capture the central 15x22mm  portion with a small sensor slr.
how much better is eleven megapixels?
there are certainly a lot of good nikon cameras, as shown by the reviews  at thislink for nikon products.
meanwhile it is instructive to look at the posts above if only to note that the predictions and rumours in them are all entirely wrong.
both  media have their weaknesses.
after that i've found so many scams like that one that i  recommend everyone doing the same before they buy their camera online.
microdrives work in the camera, but operate very slowly if you are taking 14 mb  raw images.
so, given the fact that the 5d is so cheap, should i buy that one instead given the facts that i presented to you?
also i use the 24mm ts-e shift lens a lot for architecture, which would be impossible with any nikon or fuji camera.
it's status as 'last season's fashion' will help drive second hand
the best test really is to hand the camera to a novice and see  what happens.
(am i making  any sense?)
having recently found a great deal on a 16-35l,it seems clear that i  should do the right thing and move from a rebel to a 5d(mkii still a little  pricey) to get the full-impact of the glass.
a recent review of a top photo printer (and by that i mean one  costing over 500 pounds sterling, rather than in the 200 pounds sterling price  range) by someone experienced in both digital and darkroom techniques, said  that it produced the best prints he had ever seen, including those from a  traditional darkroom.
shooting with film makes you think about so much more and makes you  get a grip on things that digital will never teach you.
i enjoy film and still purchase film equipment.
for me, the  argument in favour of digital is all about time, practicality and  accessibility.
he said i should hold off buying it, because that the next upgrade to the 5d was going to be announced pretty soon, ranging from $2500-3500.
i'm no big fan of nikon, i just like the cameras they make.
i enjoy shooting with my elan7, as well as my canon 5d. i have noticed a big difference in image quality going from my xti to the 5d. either way, i have found the driving factor for great image quality is the glass, namely l-glass.
after 'restoring' them for presentation at my father's 90th birthday, i found i rather liked the feel of these vintage images and now find myself trying to make new images look old.
there are many settings if  you would need them but to many for what i need,i will not need another camera
but having a crappy camera and a great eye prevents you from getting the right output especially if you think of commercially gaining from it.
i think the true test of a photographer is attempting to take the same quality images with a film camera, as you can create using a digital camera with hours of photoshop work afterwards.
digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images and are  extremely useful tool for the most common circumstances.
and, with that said, what would be my best alternative for event photography?
without some kind of linguistic shorthand here, we are going to  have to teach basic physics every time we try to discuss lens  selection--leaving the typical photographer with either glazed eyes or a  dumbfounded expression.
i used bronicas and a number of canon  bodies and lenses.
as a very late visitor to this page, long after the mk ii is out, and after i have bought myself a nice used 5d, i have to say that the original review was nice, but many of the comments above seem tome to be by people who either haven't ever actually used the camera, or, at the least, have never read the manual.
i'm very fond of wide lens photography and i wouldn't like  to lose my cheap 19-35mm :).
if you need high frames per second, i would not  recommend this camera.
if you decide to go the photoshop/bridge route, you might find the dam book: digital asset management for photographers (peter krogh; o'reilly 2005) helpful.
a child's first year canon eos 5d
however have been used to 12mp files  from the fuji, although it was an interpolated 12mp, and the fujis - both s2  and s3 - made nicer colors.
the 5d is a spectacular body.
i got mine used for $1000!
but somehow, after a few  drinks that tasted wierd but have a tequila like effect, i figured that they  have some kind of machines were i could use a plastic card to get money out of  it.
the mid game is still years away.

i never considered film photographers artistic because all one was  doing was pushing a button.
but try that little experiment: you took some photos with your brand new 2,799usd canon5d, some are truly artistic masterpieces and you want to print them.
ofcourse the brand has no impact on the photos you make, and neither does  it make you a better photographer than you are.
i know the problem from my old film eos and i've never been happy about this af.
sure, i could  build a great vintage camera for much less money than a 5d, but i'd spend more  on film, paper, chemicals and processing in 1 month than i would on a good  digital camera.
is film or digital better?

it does just about everything that an $7000 eos 1ds body from 2004 did at about half the weight (2 lbs).
canon's quality control has diminished in my mind and i'm disappointed that all they would do was document my two cases of dust right out of the box.
the best test really is to hand the camera to a novice and see what happens.
i wonder how many photographers have never gone to the trouble and expense of having their own darkroom, but in recent years have successfully used their computer to shape and knock out great images from their digital camera?
they are very fast for dslrs.
it is disappointing to see the lack of film photography being taught.
each camera had dust in the viewfinder and on the imaging sensor, the second body also had a problem (i thought) with the image numbering system, showing them as _mg_0001 rather than img_0001.
you may still be able to find the canon eos 5d, (compare prices), available from one of our partners.
but if canon is so capable, why is their flash metering system so inferior compared to nikon?
i found two shops that sell the 5d for $849 and  the 400d for $339 which is incredibly cheap.
can someone please explain this?
in a year or two, of course, it will be just one more good camera.

so the only way to frame an image precisely is to take a test picture, look at the edges on the bright 2.5" rear lcd, and then recompose and click again.

david palermo , march 01, 2007; 03:45
i've done both, and personally, digital allows me sooo much more access to my photos.
so it is not so  professional as pretended.
i almost lost it in  a pawnshop in las vegas after i ran out of money!
do you want to have all your  work essentially be defined by 1's and zero's?
canon is a massive company with the $billions to invest in building semiconductor fabrication lines.
if you are a wide-angle junkie and have a bunch of older canon eos lenses designed for film cameras, you'll love having the eos 5d.
film is more organic and like many examples of older technology it will always have its place and use and class (i have a fine omega mechanical wristwatch; sure it isn't as accurate as a quartz watch but it has class).
i would say that if you have the money to spend on a canon 5d then definately try to get proffesional canon lenses.
guido ersettigh (milan) , october 08, 2006; 05:45 p.m. claudia our friend knows well perspective theory in fact he used a lens  that lets you basculate its axis in order to correct perspective distortion  along one direction - optical bank lets you move, thanks to the bellow system,  in any direction so you can correct distortion along any axis or put an whole  item in focus even if it's not parallel to the lens -.
this sounds great and indeed would be  great on a film camera where slide mounts and cropping during enlargement often  result in the sacrifice of some of the image at the edges.
these may be more expensive than the sigma but the point of having a 5d is so  you can produce quality pictures, so go with the quality lens aswell!!
these may be more expensive than the sigma but the point of having a 5d is so you can produce quality pictures, so go with the quality lens aswell!!
my comments have no impact whatsoever on the  market image of either canon or nikon.
digital has mainstreamed the amount of people that can produce an amazing  shot (by themselves, digital photography largely cuts out the middleman in  mainstream film, ie.
i am assuming this lens is not designed for the 5d. could someone with more knowledge on this issue please expound?
shane, here is a group of guys who just might disagree with you.
it's status as 'last season's fashion' will help drive second hand prices lower.
nicholas eskey , april 03, 2008; 02:10 a.m. i was in ritz camera store today, looking to see if they still had canon  5d's in stock, since most of the camera stores in san diego seem to not, and i  spoke with the counter guy about it.
its almost a non-comparison.
i really don't enjoy the digital darkroom.
why can't canon create a metering system like nikon's color 3d matrix metering?
i do, however, use l lenses which i think more important than a couple of megapixels.
saying this though, your sigma lens should produce 17mm pictures without a problem.
you could be in the middle ages handing out 8x10 prints to spectators moments after the joust ended in a fatal impalement.
nikon's metering and flash systems are state of the art.
this is a big step up from the 10d and 20d which i use for back up, but i agree that the industry is geting too pricy for consumer or semi pro photographers.
i have the 100mm f/2 just for that first instance, where 2 stops  can make a big difference in stopping the motion of a galloping horse.
so a total of 3 5ds and all of them underexposed with backlighting.
is there a view that the 5d is just the first full frame pro-sumer digital  that will soon be replaced by canon?
i make all kind of pictures, from sport to landscape and i am planning to buy the 40 d. however i am very tempted by the 5d. i have 3 lenses all l ones.
i don't believe you can take a  grainy image with digital.
landrum kelly , july 19, 2007; 09:10 a.m. go nikon!
it is my opinion that it is "cheating" to use some of the more advanced photoshop functions to manipulate your image because they allow you to create a "better" image than you originally captured.
i see the 5d more adequated for great prints with their big sensor allied with excelent characteristics.
vincent martin's compelling contribution to this discussion highlights the superiority of both the quality and professionalism associated with state-of-the-art film-based work.
digital is just someone's opinion, but i find it highly  inflammatory for no reason at all.
that's why 5d is such an amazing gear, will so is the nikon d3.
difficult to recreat with 35 mm, large format, or even digital cameras.
it is also a good bit less expensive than the nikon d2xs.
i do not care about the difference between 12mp and 22mp.
i must say that the 5d's image quality is great.
alan cukurs , january 16, 2008; 01:01 a.m. get the 5d. if you like wide, the full frame will be a big benefit.
as evita m put it so concisely, the real magic lies with the person taking the photograph.. and frequently, the luck of catching a passing moment as it happens.. whether a facial expression or the momentous interplay of light and landscape.
i still don't enjoy the digital darkroom that much
so  you did a million weddings and a zillion portraits?
cody jorgensen , june 03, 2007; 06:28 p.m. i know that the first comment on this review, that discusses the debate  between film vs.
now, if digital only had the same effect on  good canon glass...... alan cukurs , april 17, 2008; 01:42 a.m.
i use the 645 lenses on the 5d with a  mirex adapter (shift comes in handy, since i do a lot of architecture).
a good photograph on a slide is still better resolution than most digital cameras (perhaps all), but if you scan it - you're re-sampling data, and that will cost you, and you might be better off with having taken the original with a digital camera.
so far as this is concerned, given the very diffucult engineering required  to produce a high quality wide angle zoom, i would prefer to purchase wide  angle prime lens :
(the  actual conversion factor is going to be about 1.6 for the canon small sensors,  and about 1.5 for the nikon sensors, but 1.5 is close enough to be useful in  practice for all of them.)
but then i got so many projects going using the "dry" darkroom in my computer.
the only thing that worked was when the salesman used spot metering on the subject's face by going up in his face to lock in the exposure.
and traditional slides still have more of both, resoloution and contrast.
not that it matters, but i think one would do better to search for 5d on  the eos forum than to pay much attention to the comments here.
ok, i had no plans to shelv my pentax k1000, and even still had a desire to eventually convert an unused bathroom into a darkroom.
i also want to use my 50mm 1.4, especially for low-light photography, so the 5d is the only choice.
i took it to canon factory service and they said there was nothing they could do.
about the only reason i can see to ante up the extra money and haul around the added weight of the 70-200mm f/2.8l would be if one routinely takes action pictures in low light or if one is obsessively enamored of blurry backgrounds.
nothing  like objectivity. .
bernie ess , april 01, 2007; 06:35
i use photoshop but only to do the most basic image adjustments such as cropping, resizing, adjusting levels and curves, etc.
the sensor plane is closer to the front of the camera with the smaller sensor cameras, nothing else.
i for one regret immensely never being schooled in film, however there is so much to learn in digital as well.
so, i hope he really did have the inside info, and that a canon "5d ii" is on the way.
05:07 a.m. i have had my canon 5d for about 10 weeks now and i love it a superb  camera,you can crop a small part of a file and the result is still very good,i  also like the idea of changing the iso for each shot when i want to and i can  do it just over a second with no bother at all,the only setting i use is the  iso 50 setting for when i want to use it,some times i use the mirror setting so  when you press the shutter release the mirror shoots up and went you press the  shuter release again it will take the photo which is a good idea when taking  macro shots as the mirror will not vibrate then !
has anyone else heared of this?
all in all, the 5d has made me shoot things i would never have shot without it.
i think this is going to be my next birthday  present, its just the weight & cost thats going to hurt - ouch.
highlights can burn out much easier and in the shadows the transition from very dark to real black can be quite sudden.
jean-baptiste avril , may 23, 2006; 03:55 p.m.ellypses bought an eos 5d two months ago.
it has meant a huge learning curve for me.
for some people, the film v digital argument is relevant and will legitimately continue for a long time.
the small sensor  canon bodies turn an exciting 20mm wide angle lens into a boring 30mm  perspective.
canon still has a bit to learn from nikon in some areas.
now, though not being a maniac of the very latest gadget, the possibility of a new 5d version makes me slow down my upgrade...
there is no magnification with the smaller sensor cameras.
thus you're able to manually adjust focus but have automatic assistance available when desired.
but i'm not sure i like spending the money for a lens that will only work on  the 30d and not the 1d or my canon film bodies.
let the camera rest for a few minutes and the battery voltage will come back.
(it turns out this is not a problem.
andrew klerck , may 12, 2007; 04:19 a.m. hey robert, well the 5d is a full frame sensor (like a film slr).
but i've read all the review
i make all kind of pictures, from sport to landscape and i am planning to  buy the 40 d. however i am very tempted by the 5d. i have 3 lenses all l ones.
all in all, the 5d has made me shoot things i would never have shot  without it.
that's pretty good market share for grandpa's camera brand!
i have been looking at the 5d as my primary and my 30d as my backup so i won't be losing time changing lenses.
photography in available, i.e., low, light is a pleasure with the canon eos 5d because the typical lenses that you'd use with this camera include the standard 50/1.4 from the film world.
you cannot use those mediums in the same way yet you have what is called a 'painting' in the end.
it's a six-car pileup at the intersection of art and commerce and the amount of opinion and hyperbole that is somehow labeled as... by philip greenspun, september 2006 (updated february 2011)
the canon eos 5d does not have a built-in flash.
note that, as with most digital  single lens reflex cameras, the 5d cannot provide you with a preview in the  rear lcd because the sensor is occluded by the viewing mirror until you press  the shutter release.
i started with the 300d, switched to the 20d and now have the 5d.
a little consideration more: the  hasselblad h3d-22 (that's a heavy medium format bazooka) has a 4080x5440 square  format sensor that produce a 22mpx file or, in print-size terms, a 13x18 print.
like me, they have taken the time and effort to  understand, for example, what a colour space is and whether a device uses an  rgb or cymk model.
i must say that the  5d's image quality is great.
a community of photographers search all of  photo.net photo captions photo tags equipment store home > equipment > canon > eos 5d most popular lenses popular articles missing pages: white balance jon sienckiewicz offers a juiced-up user guide for creative people via his  "missing pages" column on photo.net.
if so, i would prefer to get by with the quality small sensor 40d.
and they are the present and the future of photography, i know that
as a very late visitor to this page, long after the mk ii is out, and after  i have bought myself a nice used 5d, i have to say that the original review was  nice, but many of the comments above seem tome to be by people who  either haven't ever actually used the camera, or, at the least, have never read  the manual.
i just wish that one camera would do all i want,  the closest is the 1d mk3.
--lannie shane phil , july 19, 2007; 12:46 a.m. i have tried both canon and nikon systems, and here is my 2 cents worth:  canon is an excellent system if you have the time and patience to play around  with its settings, especially the iso which is not automatic.
you are not asking the design  engineers to overcome significant and difficult design compromises by desiging  "one wide angle zoom that suits all" etc.
i'm saying your argument sounds like someone that hates  anything other than film and it just doesn't make any sense.
unfortunately, i'm in the middle of a job and now will have to rely on my 1d to finish it.
i rather, uh, suspect that phil g. is aware of the crop factor if an idiot such as myself is, and that is why he was very careful to insert the word "effectively."
vincent martin , july 30, 2006; 05:01 a.m. i have read the above and there are a great variety of inputs and some poinient and timely infomrations.
its just my personal opinion just like anyone else's on this site.
but having a crappy camera  and a great eye prevents you from getting the right output especially if you  think of commercially gaining from it.
one nit: the 100mm f/2 is not the only alternative to the  70-200mm f/2.8l.
i put aside all thought of film and decided to learn how to use digital properly.
i do like the fact that it does have the 35mm size sensors  and that it is built so similar to the 30d. i have been price checking and find  several hundred dollars variation in prices.
colin carron , october 03, 2008; 05:16 a.m. now that the canon 5d mk ii has appeared (september 2008)
it is still a hard decision; i think i will be shooting with the d200 for a bit longer and wait to see if nikon do go ff or if they stay with dx.
someone commented on how digital is almost catching film resolution or something.
i have been looking at the 5d as my primary and my 30d as my backup so  i won't be losing time changing lenses.
put another away, using a 100mm lens is going to give you an effective focal length of [approximately] 150mm when used with the 10d, 20d, 30d, and digital rebel series.
i do not know about the engineering but i seem to get much better pictures in low light situations with the fullframe.
i for one regret immensely never being schooled  in film, however there is so much to learn in digital as well.
so what's the  big deal?
search for similar products on  pricegrabber results by pricegrabber.com text and pictures copyright 2005-6 philip greenspun.
one last thing, i found my 28-80 was not wide enough in some situations for weddings.
if you are a wide-angle junkie and have a bunch of older canon eos lenses  designed for film cameras, you'll love having the eos 5d.
as for printing, guess what, i can print to slides from digital just as easy as printing on paper if i want to go wet.
for my purposes, though, resolution and low light performance aren't huge  issues, so my olympus e1 is actually better in other regards: much smaller and  lighter, weatherproofed, and better lenses (in my price range).
also i use the 24mm ts-e shift lens a lot for architecture, which would be  impossible with any nikon or fuji camera.
add a comment ed sweeney , may 18, 2006; 07:18
in film, someone pains in a dark room for hours, using tangible tools that move  and change light as its placed onto a print.
i loved the slide films in the studio.
colin mark chapman , may 21, 2007; 03:10 p.m. i was just at my local jessops store & the guy there told me that  production on the 5d has now ceased!
as for the 5d, i bought mine over a year ago and love it every second of the time i am using it, as well as looking at the finished work.
i will have to get him into a darkroom.
my camera choices are: nikon d2x, nikon d200, canon 5d, canon 1ds mark ii  (or wait for the new canon 1d mark iii (8mps)).
although the d70 would make a great backup camera.
i've done both, and personally, digital allows me sooo much more access to  my photos.
i don't own many lenses - 10.5mm and the 18-70 that came with the d70.
with the 5d, what you got with your 20mm lens on the film camera  is what you get with the 5d. the canon eos 5d is compact and plasticky, but solidly built.
quico álvarez , december 06, 2007; 02:44 p.m. i found it: eos-5d is 12 bit per channel in color depth.
and, with that said, what would be my best alternative for event  photography?
this month covers the topic of white balance.
i don't agree totally with your post vincent-.
are you ever actually going to look at any of those pictures again?
do you want to have all your work essentially be defined by 1's and zero's?
it is maybe not a spectacular, but a very solid and high quality  camera that can give very good files.
ken osborn , september 04, 2006; 02:14 p.m. well, vincent, i agree with what you say and i disent.
so i am in the same:  will continue scanning till they get a product that won't be obsolete in less  than five years.
on the price, are you getting one used?
they're 13mpx, that's to say near the state of the art for a  digital 35mm size-like camera.
digital has mainstreamed the amount of people that can produce an amazing shot (by themselves, digital photography largely cuts out the middleman in mainstream film, ie.
and i am fine with 3-5 fps, as i am, like most people out there, not a sport event shooter (5fps will do the job well, though).
you've successfully driven the price of a eos 3 down to a paltry $248.50 on  ebay.
zhero.net jonathan farmer , march 22, 2007; 01:31 p.m. can anyone give a honest opinion on how the 5d, d2xs and the finepix s5 compare with respect to image quality.
usm, (compare prices) (review), which is  essential for day-to-day and low light photography, you will probably want the  following standard professional zoom lenses: canon ef 16-35mm f/2.8l ii usm, (compare prices) canon ef 70-200 f/2.8l is ii usm, (compare prices)
if so, i would prefer to get by with the  quality small sensor 40d.
best regards andrew klerck , may 03, 2007; 03:44 a.m. i work at a photo lab.
what about film cameras?
compared to nikon the full-frame canon eos 5d is cheaper than nikon's top-of-the-line  small-sensor body.
it  doesn't matter whether you use film or digital.
my only recourse is to purchase from a local dealer where i can inspect the camera before i buy it to make sure there is no dust in the viewfinder.
if you are rich and dumb, i would definitly suggest  going digital.
difficult to recreat with 35 mm, large format, or even  digital cameras.
i have to admit, however, that both the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x shoot more frames per second than the 5d.
and traditional  slides still have more of both, resoloution and contrast.
for the most part i keep the  original raw files and print the best of them.
you know that a good print (say lambda) must be  300dpi to be called a good photo-print...and so?
in all it's been a hell of a workhorse camera for me, producing consistently high quality images even under adverse conditions.
joao pedro jorge , january 13, 2008; 02:36 p.m. i've been reading reviews on the 5d and the 40d because i'm thinking of buying a new camera.
you may want to do what i'm going to do, buy it from a local retailer where you can inspect it first.
no dings, scratches, and best of all no internal damage to camera or  lens.
" it's important to remember that even if you can scan something at a million dots per inch - you may just be fooling yourself.
i went digital in 2001 on a trip to egypt to teach laboratory sciences and did not want to cart around several pounds of film together with all the other stuff i brought.
the difference between film and digital isn't that any rich moron can take great pictures with a $7000 camera (they can't).
but i also love the grainless look of the digital.
the viewfinder image is substantially larger than on the small-sensor canon bodies.
in very practical terms, that  is, a 600mm lens will give results in terms of image size comparable to 900mm  lens when used on a sensor approximately 2/3 the length and width of a full  frame sensor.
i only shoot in digital and believe my photography is beauty which i have created and cherish the percentage of the shots which are excellent.
by that time i hope nikon will also be  truly in te (full) frame and be producing a lower price competitor so that i  can think aout returning to nikon.
digital pictures are different but damn, some of them are of wonderful color and quality.

i have a friend that purchased a 40d. he likes the fps but wishes he had  purchased the 5d. if you have not used a 5d, perhaps you might borrow or rent  one and see if it suits you.

is there a view that the 5d is just the first full frame pro-sumer digital that will soon be replaced by canon?
operation is modeless.
arunas salkauskas , december 10, 2006; 02:09 a.m. "a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
incredible  photos, i have no more need for film.
compared to th 300d the 5d gives me quality prints close enough to film.
at the 10k range, the benefit of mf is obvious, the single pixel size (pitch) is much larger (8.4um) than the 1ds mkiii's 6.4um.
i do not choose a camera based solely on market  share, of course, but such data are not irrelevant to me.
but i need my lcd to show me exactly what i'm getting.
the 70-200mm f/4l is a lot cheaper (the f/4l is is cheaper than the non-is f/2.8l) and a lot lighter (the f/4l is is about half the weight of the f/2.8l is).
the 5d has the standard focus modes of any canon slr: manual, single-shot auto, continuous auto, and "ai focus" where the camera tries to figure out whether or not your subject is moving.
there are a lot of good cameras out there from quite a number of manufacturers.
it is possible, just a question of  self- control.
if you take 100 pictures in quick succession, don't be alarmed when the "low battery" symbols flashes.
if the rumors are true and canon is going to come out with a replacement to the 5d i might be interested in that as well.
i have a quality range of l series glass and if i went down the full frame path, would purchase couple of wide angle primes.
a good photograph on  a slide is still better resolution than most digital cameras (perhaps all), but  if you scan it - you're re-sampling data, and that will cost you, and you might  be better off with having taken the original with a digital camera.
p.m. the film vs. digital is such a worn out debate.
i don't own many lenses - 10.5mm and the 18-70 that came with the  d70.
my  purpose buying it was to do architecture (50% of my assignements) with the 24  tse i already had on a eos 1n rs, amazing lens.
so i'm  hoping that i've found the best of both worlds.
i ended up using it like a (very  expensive!)point and shoot.
the have been  there and done that (film that is).
there are remedies for this, similar to shooting 35mm film with a wide angle lens.
the 13-megapixel canon eos 5d single-lens reflex digital camera is the first consumer-priced ($2700) full-frame sensor body.
brandon boghosian , april 05, 2008; 11:09 p.m. i'd like to thank everyone out there buying canon 5d's and other dslr's.
without reading the manual, you can  go into the custom function menu and the camera to lock up the mirror before  taking a picture (then set self-timer mode on the drive button and the camera  automatically configures itself for a 2-second self-timer delay; press the  button and the mirror locks up, then the shutter opens two seconds later).
thanks again jonathan farmer , january 25, 2008; 05:47 p.m. surly the 5d is due for a make over; will it be the 5d mk2??
compared to th 300d  the 5d gives me quality prints close enough to film.
they are different mediums same as the way you would use either oils or  water colours.
in addition, the build quality of nikon cameras is legendary.
it lacks a proper lcd  display.
a.m. hi how do you leave the 5d on a tripod and use a self timer that lasts for  atleast an hour and shoot continously.
the  best digital camera available.?
if you are a serious photographer, you will want to purchase and carry a  backup bp-511a battery (the same battery that canon has used in the 20d and the  gn point-and-shoot models).
the only problem for deciding for 5d is the price.
yes, canon can do 14bit ad conversion, but if the pixel picks up only nosier data at first hand, more resolution in the ad stage simply won't help much - (amplifying the noise)?
for some people, the film v digital argument is relevant and will  legitimately continue for a long time.
digital is just someone's opinion, but i find it highly inflammatory for no reason at all.
by the same token, i cannot afford any of the more upmarket canon full frame digitals.
shooting with film makes you think about so much more and makes you get a grip on things that digital will never teach you.
had i not invested a good number of canon l glasses, i would definitely go for mamiya or nikon d3.
the have been there and done that (film that is).
i've only used the camera for a brief moment.
and i  though my light meter was off.
it is the first in what olympus is calling it's om-d line of micro four thirds bodies.
i do notice that sales are going up and higher resolution, better colours, less distortion etc. is not the last reason for that :) and don't forget glass.
kudos to the many moderate voices above and those that focus on the  individual's artistic process above considerations of equipment and technology.
with the 5d, what you got with your 20mm lens on the film camera is what you get with the 5d. the canon eos 5d is compact and plasticky, but solidly built.
i could buy the 1ds mark ii as a  backup (kidding!).
sure, i could build a great vintage camera for much less money than a 5d, but i'd spend more on film, paper, chemicals and processing in 1 month than i would on a good digital camera.
the is will help with camera shake more than the extra stop will for the same money.
such are the relative natures of well-established and on the other hand, emerging technologies.
it always fascinates me, just how much passion can be  stirred up by the discussion of an artistic tool, in this case, the 5d. i guess  painters must debate paintbrush issues as hotly on their forums??
as for the 5d, i bought mine over a year ago and love it every second of  the time i am using it, as well as looking at the finished work.
i enjoy using my 5d as much as ever and will continue to do so.
where to buy you may still be able to find the canon eos 5d, (compare prices),  available from one of our partners.
i have won awards in art shows with digital pictures taken with a  canon d60 at 6.3 megapixels, printed on an i9900 printer at 13x19.
now, though not being a maniac of the very latest gadget, the possibility  of a new 5d version makes me slow down my upgrade...
it makes an image that goes into the  computer nice n easy.
with digital one has to be very precise and disciplined in order to not "overshoot" and make thousands of worthless crap pictures without any appeal and interest.
so i'm hoping that i've found the best of both worlds.
i believe that you have to approach digital completely differently to film.
check out thomas hawk's photos www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk which are never shot with a flash and he often shoots in very lowlight at iso 1600.
i am afraid that the answer is the first one, because canon don't say anything about it in the "specs", anouncing it proudly when they explain the advantages of the new brand eos-1ds mark iii.
or you'll lose the momentum.
if you've pressed the playback button and are reviewing images, a quick touch of the shutter release readies the camera to take pictures again.
the common error that philip greenspun's review push forward is thinking that digital camera is the best solution for all or, in another formulation, that digital camera are simply better than film ones.
i am afraid that the answer is the first one, because canon don't say  anything about it in the "specs", anouncing it proudly when they  explain the advantages of the new brand eos-1ds mark iii.
a real photographer is the one who composes the  shot perfectly and with their knowledge and technical ability will be able to  capture a beautiful photo in 1 single shot rather than taking hundreds and  finding the best one.
is full frame visibly sharper to the viewer than 1.6 at  usual viewing distances?
that difference really shows now that the  making of cameras has come down to "how much can you invest in silicon  chips?
it is more than good enough for most professional  photojournalism applications, but still simple enough that a yuppie can get one  to throw in the glovebox of his bmw suv and take pictures at the school soccer  game.
four years old and still no dust in the viewfinder.
i do not choose a camera based solely on market share, of course, but such data are not irrelevant to me.
nicholas eskey , april 03, 2008; 02:10 a.m. i was in ritz camera store today, looking to see if they still had canon 5d's in stock, since most of the camera stores in san diego seem to not, and i spoke with the counter guy about it.
85mm  for portrait, 28 as wide angle, and selective dof/ unsharpness when i wish.
the current relative  merits and weaknesses of both media have been well-detailed and seem almost  rhetorical now.
be aware of online scams.
thanks, carlos henry h , june 22, 2010;
the is will help with camera shake more than the extra stop will for the same  money.
the eos 5d is not designed for use in a continuous downpour or very dusty environment like the canon eos 1ds mark ii, though it is a basically rugged and well-sealed design.
sensitivity is adjustable from iso 50-3200 but there is no good reminder  of what you've got set and the setting is persistent if you turn the camera off  and back on overnight.
the 5d has a green "idiot mode" on the left  control dial.
i know i don't need glasses.
and it just doesn't make any sense.
it's just seems ironic to me that a  $3000-2500 camera doesn't have a lcd screen as good as my $500 point and shoot.
andrew robertson , august 24, 2007; 02:32 a.m. come on, i see at least 2 or 3 nikons out of the 60 or so cameras in that  olympics shot.
karl westphal , april 28, 2007; 10:22 p.m. southern ladies i was thinking about buying a 5d but have decided to wait a month and buy a  1d mark iii.
i'll have to bring (perhaps even legally) that case to their marketting dpt as 3000 euros is quiet an investement, even for a professional.
steve wright , december 21, 2006; 10:15 p.m. well.. what to say?
the d2xs is a superb camera, but don't have the large canon's sensor nor the tremendous s5 dynamic range.
unfortunately that particular lens with 5d seems to produce an elliptical unexpected distortion.
there is a woman who  does blurry monotypes from my digital wildlife photos and sells them for more  than i can sell the originals.
so, i hope he really did have the inside info, and  that a canon "5d ii" is on the way.
even tried my hand  at oil.
at the moment i have the following canon lens: 24- 70 2.8l; 70 -200 /4l;  135/2l; 80/1.8 ,non l; 50/1.4.
amazon... not so much- trying to be everything to everyone has negatively  impacted their customer service.
vermac santos , march 31, 2007; 07:52 p.m. jonathan, i'm in the same dilemma, thinking about 5d, finepix s5 or simply  buy a nikon fisheye for my d200 for my landscape images.
it is also interesting to look here if you want to get one indicator of  relative market shares for the various companies, not just canon and nikon--and  not just at the high end.
as a  canon user with too much money sunk into the system to switch on a whim like  the beginners without a good set of lenses or the moneyed elite who seem to  switch weekly, i hope that nikon absolutely trounces canon with its new full  frame d3 and its d300 cameras.
they're 13mpx, that's to say near the state of the art for a digital 35mm size-like camera.
the light meter of both 5ds consistently  underexposed when faced with backlit situations.
when i got my 5d things changed, there are no 'cheat' modes on this camera, you actually have to know what you are doing.
but it's time to get something more durable and higher resolution.
i can readily purchase a quality 40d, but to me that is not going forward.
s3pro is what i liked best as far as digital.
there is a greenish hue to  everything, which is unnerving when you are under the gun on a paid shoot.
p.m. straight  from the camera, no photoshop except to sign & size it.
if i shoot at iso 100 or 200 with a longer shutter speed will i notice as  much noise?
if the rumors are true and canon is  going to come out with a replacement to the 5d i might be interested in that as  well.
maximum flash sync speed is 1/200th.
(i flew the jet ranger helicopter on the left for three hours while  commander chuck street reported the traffic and talked me through the  occasional confined or pinnacle approach; i did not fly the helicopter on the  right, which is a static display at the titan missile museum near tucson,  arizona.)
maybe i just bought the only 5d  lemon.
i am having so much fun with it!
it's always  good to hear people getting good cameras for a good price.
it needs to be supported with acceptable, not super, equipment.
mark powell , april 14, 2007; 03:58
though noisier than a point-and-shoot digital camera, the canon eos 5d is extremely quiet in operation, quieter than any modern film body and with a slightly more muted and lower frequency shutter "thunk" than the small sensor canon bodies.
i use photoshop but only to do the most basic image adjustments such as  cropping, resizing, adjusting levels and curves, etc.
in my humble opinion, it is not the equipment or the media it is the art, the composition, inspiration and good light that makes a good picture.
do i need a xsi or a 5d?
the canon eos 5d has been replaced by the canon eos 5d mark ii, (compare prices) (review), and it might be more worth your money to purchase the current version.
odd that the canon tech didn't know this.)
i think i will prbably not upgrade to the canon 5d mk ii as it is too expensive but will wait for the next eolution to appear.
even a camera like the d40 has a much  superior lcd than the 5d.tests say the nikon's vibration reduction system is  better than canon's is system.
there is a woman who does blurry monotypes from my digital wildlife photos and sells them for more than i can sell the originals.
there are two  control wheels so that you can adjust aperture and shutter speed simultaneously.
when working with raw images, this is  rather sluggish on all but the very newest and most powerful pcs.
eye relief is just barely adequate for people wearing eyeglasses.
a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a  3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
i've got two extra batteries so i may bring them along, although i'm all but certain no one will let me take a photo to test the sensor.
but try that little experiment: you took some photos with your brand new  2,799usd canon5d, some are truly artistic masterpieces and you want to print  them.
i have shot over 8000 images with my 5d now and evey single one has rivaled the quality of scanned negatives shot with my leica.
the 5d has the standard focus modes of any canon slr: manual, single-shot  auto, continuous auto, and "ai focus" where the camera tries to  figure out whether or not your subject is moving.
i bought the digirebel (body only) 18 mos ago and this camera paid for  itself immediately because i used to spend-at a minimum-at least $100 per month  in film and developing.
but it's time to get something more durable and higher  resolution.
looking back over this entire thread, it is astonishing how emotional people can get over film v. digital and canon v. nikon, etc.
although not the fastest camera  for action shots, it is hardly "a patient studio photographer's  camera," and no one who has used it would characterize it thus.
i've got two  extra batteries so i may bring them along, although i'm all but certain no one  will let me take a photo to test the sensor.
if you have $7000 to spend, a strong back to carry the weight, and a quick mind to take in the many displays and complex user interface, the eos 1ds mark ii might be better than the 5d. the canon eos 5d, however, will do most professional jobs.
images that would have been difficult to attain (or costly, using a pro  lab) straight from camera to high street developer.
not in my experience.
kudos to the many moderate voices above and those that focus on the individual's artistic process above considerations of equipment and technology.
and i'm very happy about  that.
vertino machado david alpert , march 31, 2007; 11:31 p.m. the 5d is excellent in low light.
home > equipment > canon > eos 5d jon sienckiewicz offers a juiced-up user guide for creative people via his "missing pages" column on photo.net.
after that i've found so many scams like that one that i recommend everyone doing the same before they buy their camera online.
i really enjoyed being in the darkroom.
but it is now in need of repair :-(
the canon speedlite 580ex ii flash, (compare prices) (review) is canon's  current top of the line and it usefully covers an angle as wide as a 14mm lens.
an  alternative is thecanon ef 24-105mm f/4 l is usm, (compare prices) (review),  which has the advantages of light weight and image-stabilization at the cost of  one f-stop in maximum aperture, which means that the viewfinder will be only  half as bright.
the auto iso is one of the best features that can be put into a digital slr.
but i have taken a lot of pictures.
as far as i am concerned, if you are trying to make what you do take less time and be more efficient, then perhaps you should rethink what it is you are doing.
i am thinking about a 5d, but frankly i shoot  wildlife on the wing that shows well and once in a while sells with the 6.3 i  have.
i took my d200 to the usa and it survived too!!
thus you're able to manually adjust focus but have automatic assistance  available when desired.
film kills digital, i know this.
and in this time i have started selling images through stock agencies.
shall we not use them?
i don't agree totally with  your post vincent-.
and the 50d with its big pixel count in a small  crop sensor and the full frame 5d mk ii are both more capable in their noise  reduction and in other ways.
i don't really mind if their isn't a significant increase in resolution, but i would love to see the dust reduction system and the 3" lcd off the 1d mark iii.
(it turns out this is not a  problem.
anuar patjane , october 03, 2009; 02:36 a.m. it survived a trip to mexico?
compared to any of the smaller sensor dslrs i've used - and  certainly the 350d and various olympus cameras - it's huge.
compared to the more expensive canon bodies if you have $7000 to spend, a strong back to carry the weight, and a quick  mind to take in the many displays and complex user interface, the eos 1ds mark  ii might be better than the 5d. the canon eos 5d, however, will do most professional jobs.
it  is like a million times easier."
it really is hard to find a true proffessional photographer.
the creative process is not dependant on the tools.
digital, is insulting.
the original 5d is looking rather outdated.
i'm very fond of wide lens photography and i wouldn't like to lose my cheap 19-35mm :).
microdrives work in the camera, but operate very slowly if you are taking 14 mb raw images.
there is no color settings to  adjust the lcd, you can only adjust the brightness levels.
i got two cheap lenses: the ordinary ef 28-90 and a voigtlander 19-35mm.
canon's wide zooms are good, but very far from the level of the nikon.
(seemy  photoshop directory for some useful scripts, including those that were used to  generate the jpegs you see on this page.)
some  artists work with a knife and others with a fine brush.
plus, you can take more...many more of them and print or save  only the good photos.
where n is there is option?
i  love the medium format slides in the glassed gepe frames.
whatever lens you get, you will be able to shoot at the correct focal length as opposed to the previous models (20d, 30d etc) which were x1.6 or thereabouts.
nothing but giant prints or croping.
this link is not bios in my opinion and it is not writen by nikon.
i will go digital when they make the first 1,000,000 dollar digital camera which will be 108mp mamiya ofcourse, and it will accept all my rb67 lenses and ektars.
if i decide to  switch to canon now is the time since i don't have too much nikon equipment.
so you did a million weddings and a zillion portraits?
i found two shops that sell the 5d for $849 and the 400d for $339 which is incredibly cheap.
and you don't even need electricity for that one!!
we  have millions of average joe's with an $800 dslr that can produce great quality  artistic photos.....and that will obviously blow the ego of anyone who's  labored in a darkroom for any amount of time.
add some fantastic filters (which digital users throw away now) and accessories and you will be taking phenominal pictures no matter what.
because this is not a zoom lens, it has many  fewer individual pieces of glass inside and therefore you'll get the highest  possible contrast and image quality.
do i  need a xsi or a 5d?
i wonder how many photographers have never gone to the trouble  and expense of having their own darkroom, but in recent years have successfully  used their computer to shape and knock out great images from their digital  camera?
the canon 5d mark 2 has generally been given rave reiviews and has be tagged as the wedding photographers camera of choice.
it is much cheaper for  canon to make a small sensor than a big sensor.
a recent review of a top photo printer (and by that i mean one costing over 500 pounds sterling, rather than in the 200 pounds sterling price range) by someone experienced in both digital and darkroom techniques, said that it produced the best prints he had ever seen, including those from a traditional darkroom.
any idiot can use a  7000 dollar digital camera.
if i decide to switch to canon now is the time since i don't have too much nikon equipment.
i took it to canon factory service and they said there was nothing they could  do.
on the lcd skintones look washed out, the finally result on my laptop looked fine
and what can you do with 13mp?
i don't really mind if their isn't a  significant increase in resolution, but i would love to see the dust reduction  system and the 3" lcd off the 1d mark iii.
if you're going to take a lot of portraits, e.g., of a baby, and don't want to endure the weight of the 70-200/2.8, consider a primecanon ef 100mm f/2 usm, (compare prices) (review).
without some kind of linguistic shorthand here, we are going to have to teach basic physics every time we try to discuss lens selection--leaving the typical photographer with either glazed eyes or a dumbfounded expression.
that difference really shows now that the making of cameras has come down to "how much can you invest in silicon chips?" the canon eos 5d is the essential camera for everything that photographers used to do with 35mm film.
i would not sell any of my images.
in some respects, art is the way one interprets what one perceives and presents that interpretation so others can experience that expression.
you know that a good print (say lambda) must be 300dpi to be called a good photo-print...and so?
i found it very relaxing.
on the  price, are you getting one used?
but hey, you got to  pay the bills right?
nikon is a versatile system if you are on the street and every moment counts.
i enjoyed making prints in my dark room i did pr, weddings, events, sports, newspaper work, portraits and even printed some in a couple of other peoples books.
it is much cheaper for canon to make a small sensor than a big sensor.
i shoot mostly landscapes, some architectural and event photography, so the full frame is desired.
http://www.michaelclarkphoto.com/d2xreview.html regards jonathan david falk , april 06, 2007; 03:45 p.m. anyone know when canon will be updating the 5d?
a photographer has to be more skilled to use film than digital.
i know some of you are probably saying "use the histogram"!
not that it matters, but i think one would do better to search for 5d on the eos forum than to pay much attention to the comments here.
i work mostly with available light so i have to have to make sure i buy a camera that is best for low lighting conditions - i shoot hotel interiors and exteriors as well as very high resolution virtual tours of cockpits.
just looking for some recommendations from who to buy from for the best price.
antonio correia , october 21, 2007; 06:14 p.m. at the moment - october 2007 - with the 40d in the market would you still buy the 5d, instead ?
plus, you can take more...many more of them and print or save only the good photos.
search for prices for the camera i wanted.
this is not a great idea when trying to shoot a wedding.
at least 3 of the first five pictures are having some exposure issues, and the first one is obviously the worst.
you could be in the middle ages  handing out 8x10 prints to spectators moments after the joust ended in a fatal  impalement.
cheers michael brown , july 29, 2007; 06:40
digital cameras and the digital workflow have made creating or capturing a great image much easier and much more likely for novice and amateur photographers (i admit i am one of these people however i have a "moral code" regarding the level of digital adjustments i will make).
if you are rich and dumb, i would definitly suggest going digital.
that's pretty sad, considering what a tour de force of  technology the 5d's sensor is.
just google the name of the shop and reviews, like, in my case was: "bestpricecameras reviews" so, it seems that the cheapest 40d (not scam) price was around $1000 and the 5d around $2200.
the 13-megapixel canon eos 5d single-lens reflex digital camera is the  first consumer-priced ($2700) full-frame sensor body.
it is still a hard decision; i think i will be  shooting with the d200 for a bit longer and wait to see if nikon do go ff or if  they stay with dx.
i still have my old pentax and it is loaded, but i don't know when i'll find the time to take it off the shelf and finish the roll.
viewfinder viewfinder coverage on the canon eos 5d is standard for an advanced  amateur single-lens reflex camera, about 96 percent of what is recorded on the  sensor is displayed in the viewfinder.
i have shot over 8000 images with  my 5d now and evey single one has rivaled the quality of scanned negatives shot  with my leica.
saying  this though, your sigma lens should produce 17mm pictures without a problem.
now, i just delete the bad ones and print only the good ones!
so it is not so professional as pretended.
george slusher , august 23, 2008; 06:59 p.m. nice review.
this link is not bios in my opinion and it is not writen by  nikon.
i never considered film photographers artistic because all one was doing was pushing a button.
it is my opinion that it is "cheating" to use some of the  more advanced photoshop functions to manipulate your image because they allow  you to create a "better" image than you originally captured.
i use the 645 lenses on the 5d with a mirex adapter (shift comes in handy, since i do a lot of architecture).
but i'm still a little lost!
if you are a serious photographer, you will want to purchase and carry a backup bp-511a battery (the same battery that canon has used in the 20d and the gn point-and-shoot models).
microdrives are also more prone to failure than the solid-state cf cards and i do not recommend them.
the eos 5d is not designed for use in a continuous downpour or very dusty  environment like the canon eos 1ds mark ii, though it is a basically rugged and  well-sealed design.
i know some of you  are probably saying "use the histogram"!
although i have never shot either, the  specs on the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x are very, very impressive.
in the digital world, however, what you capture in the camera is what you'll be delivering in a jpeg file, unless you go into a photo editing program and take the trouble to crop.
p.m. i have to agree totally with this review of the 5d. as one who has shot leica equipment for over 30 years, this was the system of choice for me when i decided to make the transition from my trusty leica r8's & leica lenses to the digital world of the 5d with ef-l lenses.
it also allows me a greater amount of control over the in camera exposure settings and my results are getting better all the time.
i want to be able to deliver to my client larger prints with little or no  noise in shadow areas.
they hold thier value beautifully.
the viewfinder image is substantially larger than on the small-sensor  canon bodies.
well, i love the 5d camera, but to dismiss nikon as a small company with clever optical engineers is, well, way, way off.
and i think there lies a fundamental principal.
it's "almost" like the canon 1ds mark ii at a much lower  price so for me it"s grate really
in very practical terms, that is, a 600mm lens will give results in terms of image size comparable to 900mm lens when used on a sensor approximately 2/3 the length and width of a full frame sensor.
i am assuming this  lens is not designed for the 5d. could someone with more knowledge on this  issue please expound?
(the guys you see on television might have the 600/4, but that comes in its own suitcase and costs more than a small kia sedan.)
as soon as you scan a negative to digital in order to make an enlargement, you are losing quality, no matter how good the scanner is.
if they have not explored film far enough, and do not require some huge size out of the ordinary output, they probably will not know what they are missing switching to digital.
the primary advantages of having a digital sensor the same size (24x36mm) as a frame of 35mm film are (1) higher image quality, especially in terms of noise and especially in lower light situations, and (2) the ability to use very wide angle lenses.
unfortunately, i'm in the middle of a job and now will have to rely on my 1d to  finish it.
my purpose buying it was to do architecture (50% of my assignements) with the 24 tse i already had on a eos 1n rs, amazing lens.
robert ingram , may 11, 2007; 12:39 p.m. i just bought a canon 5d. apparently, the salesperson did not know what  they were talking about, because he encouraged me to buy the canon 5d with the  sigma dc 17-70 f/2.8 lens.
there are a lot of good cameras out there from quite a number of  manufacturers.
from where you stay it's normal to have  perspective because the viewpoint where you are when taking that photo is lower  not perfectly "perpendicular" and also in the middle of the buildyng  (sorry my english, i'm not a native...)
robert sault , january 31, 2008; 08:06 p.m. i just talked to canon on the phone today, and they have no plans for a makeover of the 5d, it will possibly be the 7d in q3/q4 of 08.
a new lineup that is intended to attract a more... there are few industries as heart-wrenching as the fine art business.

but if  canon is so capable, why is their flash metering system so inferior compared to  nikon?
whilst recent advances have been made in the film domain, they are small and in the future, further advances are likely to remain small, when compared to the strides that have been taken in the digital domain in recent years.
i bought the digirebel (body only) 18 mos ago and this camera paid for itself immediately because i used to spend-at a minimum-at least $100 per month in film and developing.
i  suggest mr. greenspun do a little more research before making completely  invalid statements which mislead camera buyers and uniformed photographers.
it may not make a lot of sense  to anyone else, but i've found utility in blue-channel noise that most everyone  else wants to disown.
i am at the cross roads of staying with  nikon optics or going over to canon full frame system (a major expence)
there is no color settings to adjust the lcd, you can only adjust the brightness levels.
i am hoping to use a d2x and get the same quality but maybe the 5d  will do well.
lol a bit of dust and air pollution is not enough to name mexico a measure parameter for camera resistance.
the 5d especially  is excellent with wide angle and fish eye lenses.
i also enjoy digital photography and have been able to support my hobby by creating portraits for people through digital art.
at the moment i have the following canon lens: 24- 70 2.8l; 70 -200 /4l; 135/2l; 80/1.8 ,non l; 50/1.4.
no, nikon cannot match canon's  sensor technology;they are not the electronics giant that canon is.
05:07 a.m. i have had my canon 5d for about 10 weeks now and i love it a superb camera,you can crop a small part of a file and the result is still very good,i also like the idea of changing the iso for each shot when i want to and i can do it just over a second with no bother at all,the only setting i use is the iso 50 setting for when i want to use it,some times i use the mirror setting so when you press the shutter release the mirror shoots up and went you press the shuter release again it will take the photo which is a good idea when taking macro shots as the mirror will not vibrate then !
a  cheaper alternative but still good is the tamron range of lenses and they go  down to f2.8 aswell for a fairly wide angled lens.
if someone is prepared to arm themselves with generic photographic techniques in order to digitally capture the best possible image in front of the camera, then manipulate that image's properties to produce a work of art, then surely their efforts and dedication to the photographic art should be encouraged and commended?
but if you would like to present your pictures to your friends an family or any other larger group of people you do a slideshow.
its hard to find real photographers now as anyone with a fairly good digital is now branding themselves as pro photographers......
ok  sure and when i whip out the 11x14 empire state and make selinium oxide silver  contact prints (or whatever they are called) you will see who has cooler  pictures.
image attachment: rasberry ripple !.jpg
more and more people are going digital, thus driving down demand and prices for film gear.
only canon builds dslr with full  frame sensor right now.
i know the problem from my old film eos and i've never been happy  about this af.
you can't be going into the bride and groom's face to lock in an exposure reading.
it is the same as film and digital to me, you end up with a photograph at the end but they are not the same.
it makes an image that goes into the computer nice n easy.
when i work i constantly use the histogram and i need to make snap judgments based on the lcd image and my exposure readings.
i've got one issue to clear up.
i shot with a rebel xti and when i went to the full frame
i have not been able to resolve this megapixel issue in my head i.e what is an acceptable minimum?
i won't perform any  manipulations such as replacing colors or pasting other  "non-original" images into the photoa.
after seeing countless people come in with photos from a hell of a lot of different proffessional cameras, i would have to say that almost everything from the canon 5d has been the closest i have seen to film quality.
too bad even my photos are great with this camera.
then i could have some real fun!!
********************************************
sure, i know it's a lot bigger than  than the 20d and i've read all the who-ha of people praising it
the learning curve is real and no less valid than that of  understanding film and darkroom techniques.
these are all valid tools.
it's just a hard camera to use for glamour.
if you do not create your art  and have a bonafide craft in digital art (like making fantastic looking things  painstakingly in photoshop or other based primarily on visions in your head),  then you are basically putting your faith in those who decided how a certain  color etc. should be rendered on a screen ie color spaces, color balance and  the like.
for taking pictures of sporting events without breaking your arm, you'll want acanon ef 300mm f/4l is usm, (compare prices) (review).
some artists work with a knife and others with a fine brush.
if it is not going to be printed  bigger than 8x10 or if it is for web use then virtually every digital becomes  the same whether it is $150 or $3000.
but i think film camera are still useful today.
both richer and more pleasing, and more "film like".
antonio correia , october 21, 2007; 06:14 p.m. at the moment - october 2007 - with the 40d in the market would you still  buy the 5d, instead ?
do not complain  about high digicam prices.
this month covers the topic of  white balance.
if you are a workhorse photographer, that is you are commercial, then you have things like time and money to worry about, and you need to find the best and most efficient and inexpensive tool for the job.
digital has made it too easy for anyone to get into photography (i'm not  saying this is a bad thing!).
i shoot mostly landscapes, some architectural and event photography, so  the full frame is desired.
even af from basic minolta worked better than mine.
i loved shooting in film for sooo long, but even the negs of the pictures i took are just sitting up in a box somewhere.
there is a diopter adjustment and you can change the focusing screen as well.
by that time i hope nikon will also be truly in te (full) frame and be producing a lower price competitor so that i can think aout returning to nikon.
not unless you want to blow up the image to  poster size and then the 13 megapixels of the 5d will be dramatically sharper  than the 8 megapixels of the rebel.
i put aside all thought of film and decided to  learn how to use digital properly.
collect cans and shoot weddings with a popcan  pinhole array!
although not the fastest camera for action shots, it is hardly "a patient studio photographer's camera," and no one who has used it would characterize it thus.
canon's eos 5d has the standard four exposure modes: metered manual, aperture-priority, shutter-priority, and program autoexposure.
dedicated canon accessory  flash units mount in the hot shoe above the viewfinder and the camera is able  to control flash exposure via a through-the-lens sensor.
the small sensor canon bodies turn an exciting 20mm wide angle lens into a boring 30mm perspective.
in all things artistic it  is the message not the media which is important.
and we all know that good home cooking is best, but sometimes a quick takeaway hits the spot as well.
digital has made it too easy for anyone to get into photography (i'm not saying this is a bad thing!).
having recently found a great deal on a 16-35l,it seems clear that i should do the right thing and move from a rebel to a 5d(mkii still a little pricey) to get the full-impact of the glass.
it's  a six-car pileup at the intersection of art and commerce and the amount of  opinion and hyperbole that is somehow labeled as... dslrs in the movies: 'hellbent' the ten best action films of 2011 understanding dpi: the solution to resolution ready, set, go:
i'm not saying one is better than the other.
the learning curve is real and no less valid than that of understanding film and darkroom techniques.
zhero.net jonathan farmer , march 22, 2007; 01:31 p.m. can anyone give a honest opinion on how the 5d, d2xs and the finepix s5  compare with respect to image quality.
evita m , october 17, 2006; 03:42 a.m. "digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images " i still think it's the one behind the lens who makes an image terrific or  not, the camera itself, whatever camera, just makes a picture.
i think i  will prbably not upgrade to the canon 5d mk ii as it is too expensive but will  wait for the next eolution to appear.
meanwhile it is instructive to look at the posts above if only to note  that the predictions and rumours in them are all entirely wrong.
the following images were taken at iso 800: batteries the included lith-ion battery is adequate for a day of active photography,  somewhere between 300 and 500 photos plus review.
there are  currently no sellers for this product.
too  bad even my photos are great with this camera.
it lacks a proper lcd display.
the underscore means the white space was changed from srgb to adobe rgb.
one nit: the 100mm f/2 is not the only alternative to the 70-200mm f/2.8l.
just google the  name of the shop and reviews, like, in my case was: "bestpricecameras  reviews" so, it seems that the cheapest 40d (not scam) price was around $1000 and  the 5d around $2200.
the canon eos 5d cannot run on disposable aa batteries.
in other words an image captured with the camera held vertically will appear on a computer screen in a vertical orientation.
you lose image stabilization, but gain one f-stop in aperture so you can use higher shutter speeds and the viewfinder will be brighter.
i find myself now with amazing distortions (ellypses) and the canon pro services recently told me it was the "inconvenience" of full frame captors.
if he had not seen the problem, he would not have  chosen his words so carefully.
images that would have been difficult to attain (or costly, using a pro lab) straight from camera to high street developer.
digital unlocks  creative possibilities because you never have to worry about how many shots you  have left (or how many you need to get the image you want).
want to really do something?
this is a photo of pro photographers using predominantly eos systems at the  olympics in 2004, a very demanding situation where "every moment  counts" (your phrase).
the original 5d  is looking rather outdated.
i keep a small pocket-sized book  with me with prints of my favorite photos.
i currently own a 20d and prior to purchasing it had actually never used a  "real" film camera (don't laugh but the only camera i had used was a  single use disposable film camera).
there is no magnification with the  smaller sensor cameras.
i am aware that there appears to have been a batch of 5d's that had dust problems, but mine (luckly) was not one of them and when i did finally get somedust on the sensor (bad handling on my part), it was easy enough to clean w/o the need for a sensor cleaning kit or canon' service facility.
what you see is what you get.
ofcourse the brand has no impact on the photos you make, and neither does it make you a better photographer than you are.
and in  this time i have started selling images through stock agencies.
being very uneducated on the 5d sensor, i went along with his request.
that is a bold statement, but having bought the very same printer myself and seeing the results from images taken with my 5d, i can understand his claim.
canon  still has a bit to learn from nikon in some areas.
so hurray  nikon and hurray pentax.
highlights can burn out much easier and in the  shadows the transition from very dark to real black can be quite sudden.
canon includes some image library management software with the eos 5d, including the zoom browser ex.
--lannie shane phil , july 19, 2007; 12:46 a.m. i have tried both canon and nikon systems, and here is my 2 cents worth: canon is an excellent system if you have the time and patience to play around with its settings, especially the iso which is not automatic.
it is hard to tell whether the dust problems began with amazon.com or are the  result of poor quality control from canon.
jdm von weinberg , june 16, 2009; 02:52 p.m.
why would i spend extra money on  development and enlargement on a photo that cannot even be manipulated on basic  levels that is such commonplace in digital photography today?
i'm not saying one is  better than the other.
shall we not suspend judgment until we have  actually tried them?
it may not make a lot of sense to anyone else, but i've found utility in blue-channel noise that most everyone else wants to disown.
having taught photography back in the days when dinosaurs were just crawling out from the sea, i think 'wet' photography will be with us for a long time just as oil on canvas is still here.
but i am learning and starting to get results.
again,  my answer is only a guess.
autofocus performance is superb, even in dim light, with 15 af sensors distributed around the frame.
being very uneducated on the 5d sensor, i went along  with his request.
it's  in fact a scam!
danny yee , december 30, 2006; 06:35 p.m. the one thing that really impressed me when i had a play with a friend's 5d was the viewfinder.
http://www.michaelclarkphoto.com/d2xreview.html david falk , april 06, 2007; 03:45
and then there were the old family photos, one dating  to 1899.
thanks, sincerely, david beren patterson , march 12, 2007; 02:32 a.m. i'm hanging out for the 5d mark ii!
but if you use the camera like a creative tool maybe the question makes a little more sense.
there are certainly a lot of good nikon cameras, as shown by the reviews at thislink for nikon products.
i have to agree totally with this review of the 5d. as one who has shot  leica equipment for over 30 years, this was the system of choice for me when i  decided to make the transition from my trusty leica r8's & leica lenses to  the digital world of the 5d with ef-l lenses.
(the guys you see  on television might have the 600/4, but that comes in its own suitcase and  costs more than a small kia sedan.)
either  way, i have found the driving factor for great image quality is the glass,  namely l-glass.
******************************************** hi brian-i don't think i am really qualified to answer any questions in this forum but will take a guess at the answer to this one simply because no one else has replied.
i think all we have seen thus far in the dslr game is not even the entire  opening, to use a chess term.
there are no "winners" just have fun with what you like, and stop putting others down just to satisfy your own egomania.
george carter , december 16, 2006; 03:19 p.m. i bought my first dslr a canon 30d about 6 months ago and have been well  pleased.
the canon eos 5d cannot run  on disposable aa batteries.
who cares if it is 3000 or even 10,000.
i am waiting for the 5d mkii, and keeping my finger  crossed that canon with stay with 12mp to keep the single pixel size of 8.2um  of the 5d, and come up with a quality lcd such as that found on the new nikons,  dust removal (5d is a dust magnet) and liveview functions.
i just wonder whether the 'dust  magnet' issue will come back to haunt me further down the line.
of course,  the resolution of the 5d is so high that you could pull out the central 8 mp of  a canon eos 5d image and it would be almost as though you had taken the photo  with a canon 30d or digital rebel.
i think i may be selling this one soon.
one thing to note which i think is common to wide angle lenses, especially cheap lenses, is the light fall off or vignetting around the edges.
it needs to be supported with acceptable, not super,  equipment.
i think this is going to be my next birthday present, its just the weight & cost thats going to hurt - ouch.
unfortunately that  particular lens with 5d seems to produce an elliptical unexpected distortion.
the camera is always ready when you are.
to be perfectly honest, if you were a person that was extremely well  versed in the digital tools, your ability to manipulate a photograph for  artistic purposes is, and to "tweak" a photograph is so much greater  than that if film.
i got mine  used for $1000!
there are two control wheels so that you can adjust aperture and shutter speed simultaneously.
mercifully, canon does not include a cheap zoom lens as part of a  "kit" with the eos 5d.
my oldest son it taking a photography class, and i found out to my dismay, it  is a digital photography class.
it is still a great camera but showing its age with only a 4.1 mp imaging sensor.
if you take 100 pictures in quick succession, don't be alarmed when the  "low battery" symbols flashes.
people throw away old computers just like they will throw away digital cameras.
he has all the reasons to complain.
if you insist on having a wide-to-tele zoom, the standard choice is thecanon ef 24-70mm f/2.8l usm, (compare prices) (review ), which is useful for event photography such as wedding receptions.
by the same token, i cannot afford any of the more upmarket canon full  frame digitals.
perhaps i don't keep up as well as when i had the business.
my 5ds had a defective light meter.
i have found some really good deals on medium format  cameras.
i shot with a rebel xti and when i went to the full frame 5d
i have to admit, however, that both the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x shoot  more frames per second than the 5d.
i see the 5d more adequated for great prints  with their big sensor allied with excelent characteristics.
do a store review before purchasing.
if the 5d is a tough as my 30d i will  be well pleased.
personally i dislike taking hundreds of shots to get a few good ones and take my time to capture a great photo.
i have so much control over my images, it scares me.
i  would say that if you have the money to spend on a canon 5d then definately try  to get proffesional canon lenses.
the creative process is not  dependant on the tools.
i've also lost a lot of digital files over the years, but i still have our old slides from the 1960's.
the reason why you don't have perfect paralel lings there.
if i shoot at iso 100 or 200 with a longer shutter speed will i notice as much noise?
it certainly depends on the person using the camera and i believe  that you need to have the flare and artistic ability to be able to use any  camera (including digital) to produce beautiful images.
as a canon user with too much money sunk into the system to switch on a whim like the beginners without a good set of lenses or the moneyed elite who seem to switch weekly, i hope that nikon absolutely trounces canon with its new full frame d3 and its d300 cameras.
i am waiting for the 5d mkii, and keeping my finger crossed that canon with stay with 12mp to keep the single pixel size of 8.2um of the 5d, and come up with a quality lcd such as that found on the new nikons, dust removal (5d is a dust magnet) and liveview functions.
whilst film reigns supreme in many people's opinions, others would argue differently.
as  far as i am concerned, if you are trying to make what you do take less time and  be more efficient, then perhaps you should rethink what it is you are doing.
a.m. i am six months with this camera and it continues to amaze me.
yes, i chose my camera based on my requirements, and i recommended them on  this site.
and they are the  present and the future of photography, i know that
and then there were the old family photos, one dating to 1899.
after you have felt the full impact of the above photo, go read bob atkins'preview of the canon 1d mark iii.
in all it's been a hell of a workhorse camera for me, producing  consistently high quality images even under adverse conditions.
i perfectly understand all these older guys that shot film for years and years all of a sudden going, "wow i can do this with this new thing and it is like a million times easier."
i'll bring both along  with me and use 3 or 4 lenses interchangeably (along with a little lx3 for  videos and stereo shots).
nikon and hurray pentax.
the "problem" with that image that you have [posted here is not  the lens or the camera's problem...
a good image is a good image whether it was shot on film, with digital, or hand drawn on the back of a stained bar coaster.
but nonetheless the 5d is still probably the most affordable full frame  around.
flash system is average.
operating speed the canon eos 5d turns on almost instantly and has unmeasureable delays  for taking pictures, displaying previews, and waking up once asleep.
thanks~shellie ringo taylhardat , february 07, 2010; 09:06 p.m. i am planning on buying a used 5d for $1500.00, as i am on a strict budget.
however i know that doing a wedding or journalism is so much simpler with  digital.
and we all know that good home cooking is best, but sometimes a quick takeaway  hits the spot as well.
i gave a huge sigh of relief when finally getting a digital slr - i could skip a generation in the process of getting digital prints.
that is a rough rounded-off number and a rough way of getting the point across, but it works as very good shorthand in practice when deciding on a lens--and when writing reviews for a general audience.
software canon includes some image library management software with the eos 5d,  including the zoom browser ex.
i think all we have seen thus far in the dslr game is not even the entire opening, to use a chess term.
the 1.6 sensor makes my 400mm 640.
and when i whip out the 11x14 empire state and make selinium oxide silver contact prints (or whatever they are called) you will see who has cooler pictures.
usm, (compare prices) (review), which is essential for day-to-day and low light photography, you will probably want the following standard professional zoom lenses: mercifully, canon does not include a cheap zoom lens as part of a "kit" with the eos 5d.
why can't canon create a metering system like nikon's color 3d matrix  metering?
claudia michael kelly , september 21, 2006; 10:48 a.m. i've gone through two eos 5d bodies in one week, both purchased from  amazon.com.
as a matter of fact, i print photos not posters most of the time.
each camera had dust in the viewfinder and on the imaging sensor,  the second body also had a problem (i thought) with the image numbering system,  showing them as _mg_0001 rather than img_0001.
i've read many posts regarding dust issues right out of the box.
i almost lost it in a pawnshop in las vegas after i ran out of money!
i shoot glamour and getting those warm glowing skintones is paramount.
you will also see who has thier work hanging in art galleries and museums, and all the true art publications.
but much more important than  resouloution is the amount of contrast that you can record.
one thing to note which i think is common to wide  angle lenses, especially cheap lenses, is the light fall off or vignetting  around the edges.
the richness and detail of his photos at  1600 are amazing.
it is more than good enough for most professional photojournalism applications, but still simple enough that a yuppie can get one to throw in the glovebox of his bmw suv and take pictures at the school soccer game.
evan bedford , january 07, 2012; 09:48 p.m. i have a 5d and a mamiya 645.
there are no "winners" just have  fun with what you like, and stop putting others down just to satisfy your own  egomania.
xiaoyuan gu , november 28, 2007; 10:12 a.m. it is time for canon to throw the goodies of 1d mkiii and 40d to a 5d mkii,  to seriously compete with the nikon d3.
but it is now in  need of repair :-(
what about autofocus in 5d. i've heard lot complaints from those who used nikon d200 and switched to canon 5d. after this they appreciate af they used to have in nikon.
i have read that nikon produce better color and resolution and that many  people are sold more on the amount of megapixles than anything else, please see  the link below.
now i have this one what ever canon brings out,mind you if i was a lottery  winner,well, say no more !
owning a 30d with satisfies me quite well, i must say that i miss the perspectives of the full frame, 5d is definitely the choice for me.
if  you're considering purchasing this camera from an online retailer, buyer  beware.
zoe hellar , january 01, 2009; 03:51 a.m.
i love the fact that the 5d has 12.8 megs of image boosting power but for difficult shoots i find myself using the 20d. i really think canon dropped the ball on this one.
it is also  a good bit less expensive than the nikon d2xs.
for me, the argument in favour of digital is all about time, practicality and accessibility.
i think  the true test of a photographer is attempting to take the same quality images  with a film camera, as you can create using a digital camera with hours of  photoshop work afterwards.
anyone know  anymore about when this will happen?
i do weddings, seniors, kids, families etc...  i'm a canon user
there was one less mis-interpretation of the colour of the original.

the difference is that you can shoot 5000 images in one day with out spending $7000 dollars on film and carrying around a 100 pound duffle bag full of film.
i am hoping to use a d2x and get the same quality but maybe the 5d will do well.
i noticed the vingetting.
i also want to use my 50mm 1.4,  especially for low-light photography, so the 5d is the only choice.
compared to any of the smaller sensor dslrs i've used - and certainly the 350d and various olympus cameras - it's huge.
from where you stay it's normal to have perspective because the viewpoint where you are when taking that photo is lower not perfectly "perpendicular" and also in the middle of the buildyng (sorry my english, i'm not a native...)
it is a crop factor only.

wishlist for the canon eos 5d mark ii
i am aware that there appears to have been a batch of 5d's that had dust  problems, but mine (luckly) was not one of them and when i did finally get  somedust on the sensor (bad handling on my part), it was easy enough to clean  w/o the need for a sensor cleaning kit or canon' service facility.
it also allows me a  greater amount of control over the in camera exposure settings and my results  are getting better all the time.
my oldest son it taking a photography class, and i found out to my dismay, it is a digital photography class.
welcome to photo.net:
alan cukurs , may 30, 2008; 02:11 a.m. gotcha.
i gave a huge sigh  of relief when finally getting a digital slr - i could skip a generation in the  process of getting digital prints.
dont know why anyone should get upset over it.
i believe that you have to approach digital completely differently to  film.
can anybody give me some suggestions?
i only shoot in digital and believe my photography is beauty which i have  created and cherish the percentage of the shots which are excellent.
i had considered getting a 30d with the es-f 10-22mm zoom, which has been reported to be a great combination for landscape and architecture photography, but i'm not sure i like spending the money for a lens that will only work on the 30d and not the 1d or my canon film bodies.
i enrolled in a digital class and things changed.
i would like to return to the days of full frame picutures and hence the 5d appeals, even if the "motor drive" is limited to 3 fps.
anyone know anymore about when this will happen?
i loved  shooting in film for sooo long, but even the negs of the pictures i took are  just sitting up in a box somewhere.
not enough people have the  resources to set up a full b&w/color photo lab to be able to manipulate  photo's on the required level of "fine art".
what about autofocus in 5d. i've heard lot complaints from those who  used nikon d200 and switched to canon 5d. after this they appreciate af they  used to have in nikon.
a photographer has to be more skilled to use  film than digital.
canon, forget about the megapixel and fps fight!

i'm in the market for a 5d and wouldn't mind  waiting if i knew what the feature set would be.
hi brian-i don't think i am really qualified to answer any questions in  this forum but will take a guess at the answer to this one simply because no  one else has replied.
i've got one issue to  clear up.
the common error that philip greenspun's review push  forward is thinking that digital camera is the best solution for all or, in  another formulation, that digital camera are simply better than film ones.
robert nurse , may 15, 2007; 11:41 a.m. hi beren, have you read anything about the 5d mark ii or any type of replacement?
i don't believe you can take a grainy image with digital.
amazon... not so much- trying to be everything to everyone has negatively impacted their customer service.
with the 50/1.4 lens: the 16-35/2.8l lens: the 24-70/2.8l lens (mostly from the robinson r44): one perceived problem with professional-grade cameras is that they can't be used by novices.
digital unlocks creative possibilities because you never have to worry about how many shots you have left (or how many you need to get the image you want).
floyd h , february 28, 2007; 01:14 a.m.lcd screen troubles greetings camera fans, i've had my canon 5d for at least six months and everything is great
some reviewers think that the 70-200mm f/4l is is a "better" lens (sharpness, etc) than the f/2.8l at the same apertures.
both media have their weaknesses.
maximum flash sync  speed is 1/200th.
the only disadvantage to having a full-frame sensor compared  to a small-sensor digital slr body (canon digital rebel or any nikon) is that  the small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses,  which can be useful when you are doing sports or bird photography.
they are different mediums same as the way you would use either oils or water colours.
i'm in the market for a 5d and wouldn't mind waiting if i knew what the feature set would be.
i went digital in 2001 on a trip to egypt to teach laboratory  sciences and did not want to cart around several pounds of film together with  all the other stuff i brought.
not enough people have the resources to set up a full b&w/color photo lab to be able to manipulate photo's on the required level of "fine art".
to recharge the battery you must carry a chunky travel charger that plugs directly into a wall socket.
i am at the cross roads of staying with nikon optics or going over to canon full frame system (a major expence)
after much review, i am purchasing the  5d. i think it will be a wonderful brush to paint with.
so a total of 3 5ds and all  of them underexposed with backlighting.
again, i am no expert
this  is very useful for tripod and macro work.
before digital, i had to pay to have the negatives developed and the photos printed--the good ones and the bad ones!
a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
to make a very long story short: both fuji and canon have their strengths, the canon with the right converter for raw (i prefer canons own one) can produce quite nice looking results, sharp, low noise etc.
find a extremely rare and sought after  collectors film camera and outfit it with the outstanding rare and obscure  sought after glass.
arunas salkauskas , december 10, 2006; 02:09 a.m. "a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives  to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
" it's important to remember that even if you can scan something at a  million dots per inch - you may just be fooling yourself.
digital camera which will be 108mp mamiya ofcourse, and it will accept all my  rb67 lenses and ektars.
no dings, scratches, and best of all no internal damage to camera or lens.
i do like the fact that it does have the 35mm size sensors and that it is built so similar to the 30d. i have been price checking and find several hundred dollars variation in prices.
nedine o'brien , february 27, 2007; 06:21 a.m. greetings all, i've only been studying photography for three years and started doing  b&w film in a wet darkroom.
the 5d does not shoot at the blazing speeds  of the newest canon dslr, but at present neither nikon nor anyone else has a  digital camera with the kind of speed the 1d mark iii does.
some reviewers think that the 70-200mm f/4l is is a  "better" lens (sharpness, etc) than the f/2.8l at the same apertures.
i also enjoy digital photography and have been able to support my hobby by  creating portraits for people through digital art.
i understand vincent's viewpoint but we all have different levels of purism.
i have the 100mm f/2 just for that first instance, where 2 stops can make a big difference in stopping the motion of a galloping horse.
heck, the pentax k10d trounces the 40d due  solely to its in body anti shake.
with digital one has to be very precise and disciplined  in order to not "overshoot" and make thousands of worthless crap  pictures without any appeal and interest.
but i noticed right away when shooting some models with strobes, they looked like crap and i though my light meter was off.
and i think  there lies a fundamental principal.
however have been used to 12mp files from the fuji, although it was an interpolated 12mp, and the fujis - both s2 and s3 - made nicer colors.
people throw away old  computers just like they will throw away digital cameras.
i would guess that the photographer (myself included) can take way more  pictures and cheaper than using film because digital pictures are all free  until processed.
do you want to be a photographic machine?
i had own my own photo business which i closed about the time i converted to digital in 2003.
p.m. hello all, i am in the market for a new pro camera - i currently do "pro"  work with a nikon d70
the camera  is always ready when you are.
if you downloadmicrosoft raw image  thumbnailer and viewer for windows xp, you can sort photos to some extent just  using the standard windows file browser.
the full-frame canon eos 5d is cheaper than nikon's top-of-the-line small-sensor body.
i would guess that the photographer (myself included) can take way more pictures and cheaper than using film because digital pictures are all free until processed.
this is a photo of pro photographers using predominantly eos systems at the olympics in 2004, a very demanding situation where "every moment counts" (your phrase).
i don't know if the 3" lcd  will fit onto the back though.
it is hard to tell whether the dust problems began with amazon.com or are the result of poor quality control from canon.
jeremey barrett , may 18, 2007; 12:22 a.m. robert (ingram), the sigma dc 17-70 is designed for aps-c sized sensors, not full frame sensors like the 5d. the salesperson should absolutely have known that and they should take it back, it simply won't produce usable images on the 5d (light is only going to fall on portion of the sensor).
alan cukurs , june 07, 2008; 02:56 a.m.
find a extremely rare and sought after collectors film camera and outfit it with the outstanding rare and obscure sought after glass.
it always fascinates me, just how much passion can be stirred up by the discussion of an artistic tool, in this case, the 5d. i guess painters must debate paintbrush issues as hotly on their forums??
get a sort of average price.
i thought i was going to get that and more  when i bought my 5d. boy was i in for a surprise.
i'm sort of at a loss.
it has meant a  huge learning curve for me.
in film, someone pains in a dark room for hours, using tangible tools that move and change light as its placed onto a print.
i've found the review quite irritating for more or less the same reasons that vincent martin wrote about -despite
as for printing, guess what, i can print to slides from  digital just as easy as printing on paper if i want to go wet.
nikon is a small company with clever optical engineers.
the current relative merits and weaknesses of both media have been well-detailed and seem almost rhetorical now.
" conclusion the canon eos 5d is the essential camera for everything that photographers  used to do with 35mm film.
i thought i was going to get that and more when i bought my 5d. boy was i in for a surprise.
i'm torn on buying the 5d. this dust thing seems to be an issue, vignetting due to light not falling evenly on full frame sensors(apparently a big problem for canon right now).
things keep changing.
in digital, you have to master the  craft of working with tools that are intangible, and exist in the realm of  mathematics (1's, and 0's).
no, nikon cannot match canon's sensor technology;they are not the electronics giant that canon is.
different ways to achieve what in principle, should be the same end, surely?
any idiot can use a 7000 dollar digital camera.
they are simply different.
10:54 a.m. frankly for being such a fantastic camera and for philip being an experienced photographer there are some seriously over exposed pictures on this review.
the canon 17mm-40mm f4 lens works beautifuly  with the 5d and if you want the f2.8 then try the canon 24mm-70mm pro lens.
as for the 5d, yes, i believe that it has been worth the hype,  in spite of its limitations in terms of speed.
the reason why you don't  have perfect paralel lings there.

i still have my old pentax and it is  loaded, but i don't know when i'll find the time to take it off the shelf and  finish the roll.
do a store review  before purchasing.
the canon eos 5d turns on almost instantly and has unmeasureable delays for taking pictures, displaying previews, and waking up once asleep.
the daunting nature of the  processes involved in film would explain (along with relative cost) the  explosion of new digital users.
the 5d has a green "idiot mode" on the left control dial.
well, i guess it's not a big news for you guys :).
aside from all my rambling though, the 5d is definately the best digital camera out there!
i do not know about the engineering but i seem to get  much better pictures in low light situations with the fullframe.
tom h , october 18, 2006; 09:59 a.m. evita it might be true that if you don't have an eye for shooting photographs a better camera will not change that.
in other words an image captured with the camera held vertically will  appear on a computer screen in a vertical orientation.
clients get  nervous and models get bored and lose interest, you have to capture the moment
in addition, the build quality of nikon cameras is  legendary.
i enjoy film and still  purchase film equipment.
per minute atleast 10 images or less??
it is maybe not a spectacular, but a very solid and high quality camera that can give very good files.
would be quite happy using  l series primes, only need to purchase 25mm l and that would complete my lens  complement.
it's just seems ironic to me that a $3000-2500 camera doesn't have a lcd screen as good as my $500 point and shoot.
i still can't get over that 5d viewfinder, though, and that's the one  absolutely unavoidable drawback of four thirds - technology improvements and  price/size economies mean the smaller sensors will just lag 35mm sensors by two  or three years (in resolution and sensitivity), but there's no way with that  imaging circle to get abigger viewfinder image than the e1's.
in a year or two, of course, it  will be just one more good camera.
canon 5d or 1d are beautiful  cameras
instead of buying a wider lens i opted to go with a bigger frame 5d. best  regards.
so i got myself a 300d.
digicams will all turn to dust but the film cameras of yesterday will be solid as a rock.
i have a quality range of l series glass and if i went down the full frame  path, would purchase couple of wide angle primes.
janice m , february 19, 2007; 01:29 a.m. brian's question: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."
joao pedro jorge , january 13, 2008; 02:36 p.m. i've been reading reviews on the 5d and the 40d because i'm thinking of  buying a new camera.
claudia michael kelly , september 21, 2006; 10:48 a.m. i've gone through two eos 5d bodies in one week, both purchased from amazon.com.
that's why 5d is such an amazing gear, will so is  the nikon d3.
the difference between film and digital isn't that any rich moron can  take great pictures with a $7000 camera (they can't).
i have covered a  summarised review on my website: http://digital_camera_reviews.protechltd.com folarin s , february 05, 2009; 09:00 p.m. a new perspective as a new member on photo.net,i have to say that many of the above views  relating to the respective merits of film vs. digital and full frame vs 1.6  crop factor have been tremendously helpful.
shellie latham , november 03, 2009; 12:12 p.m. i need help picking a camera!
andrew robertson , august 24, 2007; 02:32 a.m. come on, i see at least 2 or 3 nikons out of the 60 or so cameras in that olympics shot.
in all things artistic it is the message not the media which is important.
i had two samples of this camera sent to me by b&h and canon broke my heart twice (actually 3 times!).
a cheaper alternative but still good is the tamron range of lenses and they go down to f2.8 aswell for a fairly wide angled lens.
--lannie shane phil , july 21, 2007; 01:13 a.m. lannie, thanks for your comments.
similarly, if we assert that digital photographers are somehow disadvantaged by having to contend with the colour space interpretations of a third-party, while not mentioning the colour bias traditionally imparted by different makes of film, it seems nonsensical.
sometimes readers, in their emotion, do not read quite so carefully.
while i was impressed with the images, i'm disappointed that i'm returned the camera again.
whatever  lens you get, you will be able to shoot at the correct focal length as opposed  to the previous models (20d, 30d etc) which were x1.6 or thereabouts.
i don't see the interpolated finepix megapixels exceed the canon.
any price that would fall more than, lets say, 20% or more out of that was proven to be a scam (in all cases).
it's the firlst camera with full frame  from this category of cameras.
so, given the fact that the 5d is  so cheap, should i buy that one instead given the facts that i presented to you?
i have not experienced any camera software problems or freezes.
i typically am not shooting high speed photography so the 3 fps works well.
thanks for the helpfull post.
george carter , december 16, 2006; 03:19 p.m. i bought my first dslr a canon 30d about 6 months ago and have been well pleased.
however, digital still-image capture is still very much in its infancy, when compared to the length of time that film has been with us.
the 30d got jerked off a folding table and hit a concrete floor and bounced first on one corner, next on the lens shade, and finally on it's back.
the picasa program from google also can understand the eos 5d's .cr2 raw files.
i then went to a local camera store and had the sales person recreate a  backlit situation in store with the same results.
i use photoshop and shoot raw.
let the camera rest for a few minutes  and the battery voltage will come back.
the only problem for deciding  for 5d is the price.
do you recommend a 5d for what i do?
cheers shane michael brown , july 29, 2007; 06:40
these are all  valid tools.
in all seriousness, nikon has been lagging behind canon for years now,  especially when it comes to long lenses and of course full frame digital.
dust is an issue with digital slrs, but not right out of the box!
the camera has an internal buffer memory for rapid sequence photography (17 raws or 60 jpegs).
as with all of the great  canon eos bodies over the decades, if you drill down into the custom function  menus, you can figure out how to make the autoexposure lock button on the back  of the camera into a "burst of af" thumb switch while in manual focus  mode.
this is particularly the case as i like to take a fair number of wide angle - generally 25mm ( in 35 mm slr speak) to 35mm.
the canon always looks to me like reduced, i guess it is the color  palette, or the cmos sensors.
if they have not explored film far enough,  and do not require some huge size out of the ordinary output, they probably  will not know what they are missing switching to digital.
i'm torn on  buying the 5d. this dust thing seems to be an issue, vignetting due to light  not falling evenly on full frame sensors(apparently a big problem for canon  right now).
of course, the resolution of the 5d is so high that you could pull out the central 8 mp of a canon eos 5d image and it would be almost as though you had taken the photo with a canon 30d or digital rebel.
well, i love the 5d camera, but to dismiss nikon as a small company with  clever optical engineers is, well, way, way off.
buck lovell landrum kelly , july 16, 2007; 10:41 a.m. buck, the key word here is "effectively."
if you are on the street and would like a dependable camera that understands you...go nikon.
i've seen some great stuff from my students using  pin-hole cameras.
so, my  procedure was the following: 1.
personally i dislike taking hundreds of shots to get a few good ones and  take my time to capture a great photo.
lol a bit of dust and air  pollution is not enough to name mexico a measure parameter for camera  resistance.
controls canon's eos 5d has the standard four exposure modes: metered manual,  aperture-priority, shutter-priority, and program autoexposure.
the sensor plane is closer to  the front of the camera with the smaller sensor cameras, nothing else.
i have used 1d mkii, 14n, slr/n, s3pro.
in all seriousness, nikon has been lagging behind canon for years now, especially when it comes to long lenses and of course full frame digital.
but canon doesn't communicate  at all on problems with this particular lens and generally says it efficient in  all situations.
but if you are smart and creative and artistic (and do not prefer to show this through computer illustration) but rather photography, shoot film.
so far as this is concerned, given the very diffucult engineering required to produce a high quality wide angle zoom, i would prefer to purchase wide angle prime lens :
but  if you use the camera like a creative tool maybe the question makes a little  more sense.
colin mark chapman , may 21, 2007; 03:10 p.m. i was just at my local jessops store & the guy there told me that production on the 5d has now ceased!
the 5d, on the other hand, is better in the following situations: the canon eos 5d has an almost identical and equally simple user interface to the cheaper canon 20d and 30d bodies.
jean-baptiste avril , may 23, 2006; 03:55 p.m. ellypses look at  verticals at the right building bought an eos 5d two months ago.

review by philip greenspun, september 2006 (updated february 2011)
robert sault , january 31, 2008; 08:06 p.m. i just talked to canon on the phone today, and they have no plans for a  makeover of the 5d, it will possibly be the 7d in q3/q4 of 08.
the 5d especially is excellent with wide angle and fish eye lenses.
i ended up using it like a (very expensive!)point and shoot.
single pixel size matters!
i am thinking about a 5d, but frankly i shoot wildlife on the wing that shows well and once in a while sells with the 6.3 i have.
here are some things that would be nice for the next version of the 5d: reminder of what iso speed is set automatic iso mode smart enough to look at the shutter speed and whether  or not the camera is sufficiently stable (i.e., tripod or not) and set the iso  accordingly to avoid camera shake compared to the cheaper canon bodies can you get a dramatically better photo with the eos 5d and a canon 50/1.4  compared to what you'd get withcanon digital rebel xti (black) and sigma 30mm  f/1.4
digital allows  photographers to experiment and create images with the camera in a way that is  much too expensive for most people to do with film.
this is very useful for tripod and macro work.
i will never miss the kodak 14n that it replaced, although i occasionally miss the aperture rings on my nikon lenses that i had to sell to be able to get both (1) full frame and (2) low noise at high iso.
featured merchants canon eos 5d 12.8 megapixel  digital slr camera body with lens kit - 0.94"-4.13" vendor  vendor rating availability price there are currently no sellers for this  product.
though  noisier than a point-and-shoot digital camera, the canon eos 5d is extremely  quiet in operation, quieter than any modern film body and with a slightly more  muted and lower frequency shutter "thunk" than the small sensor canon  bodies.
however, the issue of the cropping factor continues to be a source of  frustration.
flash the canon eos 5d does not have a built-in flash.
here are some things that would be nice for the next version of the 5d: can you get a dramatically better photo with the eos 5d and a canon 50/1.4 compared to what you'd get withcanon digital rebel xti (black) and sigma 30mm f/1.4
there was one less mis-interpretation of the  colour of the original.
ok, i had no plans to shelv my pentax k1000, and  even still had a desire to eventually convert an unused bathroom into a  darkroom.
both richer and more pleasing, and more "film  like".
book: digital asset management for photographers (peter krogh; o'reilly 2005)  helpful.
the noise just looks like a bad quality image to me  it doesn't give the atmosphere or mood that film grain does.
after seeing countless people come in with photos  from a hell of a lot of different proffessional cameras, i would have to say  that almost everything from the canon 5d has been the closest i have seen to  film quality.
dynamic range while ok in the 5d is not as good  as the s3 pro (and now the s5).
i.e., sports photographers might want to consider one of the eos 1d bodies  specifically designed for their rapid-fire needs.
crop and zoom are clear and sharp.
a.m. hi how do you leave the 5d on a tripod and use a self timer that lasts for atleast an hour and shoot continously.
how much better  is eleven megapixels?
i had two samples of this camera sent to me by b&h and canon broke my  heart twice (actually 3 times!).
canon 5d or 1d are beautiful cameras but i think film camera are still useful today.
my camera choices are: nikon d2x, nikon d200, canon 5d, canon 1ds mark ii (or wait for the new canon 1d mark iii (8mps)).
for that, you're in my debt.
it  really is hard to find a true proffessional photographer.
whilst film reigns supreme in many people's opinions, others would argue  differently.
so the 3 fps works well.
karl westphal , april 28, 2007; 10:22 p.m. i was thinking about buying a 5d but have decided to wait a month and buy a 1d mark iii.
i have done clay, batique as well as crayons.
be smart, do the  research.
there is a pc  connector on the side for studio strobes.
david manzi , october 09, 2006; 02:33
you may want to do what i'm going to do, buy it from a local retailer  where you can inspect it first.
when you are deciding on which lens designed for 24 x 36 should be used with a camera having a sensor 2/3 the length and width of that, you can use the multiplicative inverse of 2/3, which is 1.5, and thereby compute what the effective focal length will be as it affects magnification, i.e., image size.
i can do in 15 minutes what used to  take me all day in the dark room
http://www.luminous-landscape.com/reviews/tc-80n3.shtml,  http://www.usa.canon.com/html/cameras_slr/eos3acc.html michael brown , january 23, 2007; 12:55 a.m. vincent, that is the most ridiculous statement i have ever heard.
but canon doesn't communicate at all on problems with this particular lens and generally says it efficient in all situations.
who  knows where digital will take us in the future?
the underscore means the white space was changed from srgb to adobe  rgb.
i would  not sell any of my images.
i can't get close to that with my d200.
i have won awards in art shows with digital pictures taken with a canon d60 at 6.3 megapixels, printed on an i9900 printer at 13x19.
so, your max print size will  be a great...9,4x14.
i just got everything in the mail today and i am experiencing major vignetting from this lens.
i found  it very relaxing.
i rather, uh, suspect that phil g. is aware of the crop factor if an idiot  such as myself is, and that is why he was very careful to insert the word  "effectively."
if you need high frames per second, i would not recommend this camera.
the canon eos 5d has an almost identical and equally simple user interface  to the cheaper canon 20d and 30d bodies.
i've suddenly rediscovered my love of photography.
it's "almost" like the canon 1ds mark ii at a much lower price so for me it"s grate really
available light photography in available, i.e., low, light is a pleasure with the canon  eos 5d because the typical lenses that you'd use with this camera include the  standard 50/1.4 from the film world.
when i purchased my first 35mm camera 26 years ago,  i realized a new brush.
would be quite happy using l series primes, only need to purchase 25mm l and that would complete my lens complement.
p.m. hi, i have the 5d since 1 year now, before the fuji s2 and s3.
i felt compelled to speak up when i read that philip said this is ?
my only  recourse is to purchase from a local dealer where i can inspect the camera  before i buy it to make sure there is no dust in the viewfinder.
photo tags equipment store
now that we are at this point, give me a linhof super  technika only it is an 8x10 and a mountain of 8x10 polaroid film and a  processor.
it does just about  everything that an $7000 eos 1ds body from 2004 did at about half the weight (2  lbs).
i have much more respect for a photographer who creates a wonderful sunset image with both the sky and foreground having a good balance of exposure than someone who merged two images together and created a high dynamic range image.
i have not thrown away my watercolors or my 35 mm cameras etc., i have just added to what i enjoy.
when i purchased my first 35mm camera 26 years ago, i realized a new brush.
concerning film versus digital: both have advantages, but it is mainly a very personal question.
when you are deciding  on which lens designed for 24 x 36 should be used with a camera having a sensor  2/3 the length and width of that, you can use the multiplicative inverse of  2/3, which is 1.5, and thereby compute what the effective focal length will be  as it affects magnification, i.e., image size.
but i noticed  right away when shooting some models with strobes, they looked like crap
nikon's build quality and ergronomics are way ahead of canon's.
put another away, using a 100mm lens is going to give you an effective  focal length of [approximately] 150mm when used with the 10d, 20d, 30d, and  digital rebel series.
03:13 a.m. i started out with pen and ink, moved to pastels, charcoal, watercolor  airbrushing.
however, the issue of the cropping factor continues to be a source of frustration.
i would like to return to the days of full frame picutures and hence the  5d appeals, even if the "motor drive" is limited to 3 fps.
i work mostly with available light so i have to have to  make sure i buy a camera that is best for low lighting conditions - i shoot  hotel interiors and exteriors as well as very high resolution virtual tours of  cockpits.
85mm for portrait, 28 as wide angle, and selective dof/ unsharpness when i wish.
microdrives are also more prone to failure than the solid-state cf  cards and i do not recommend them.
i already own a sigma  10-20mm and a nikon 18-200mm for this job.
5d i noticed the vingetting.
and i am fine with 3-5 fps,  as i am, like most people out there, not a sport event shooter (5fps will do  the job well, though).
i just can't seem to get a saturated look on the lcd and it causes frustration during the shoot.
the best is the enemy of the good and is hard on the pandl.
a good camera without the right glass is useless too tom antonio (italy) , october 18, 2006; 05:49 p.m. i apologize for bad english grammar in my previous post... pedro p. polakoff iii , october 22, 2006; 03:24
so far there is no firmware update to  correct this.
only canon builds dslr with full frame sensor right now.
asher . , april 14, 2007; 02:01 p.m.b&h, not amazon phil- not sure if pn has some backroom deal going with amazon, but by far the best mail order photography supplier isb&h photo: huge selection, iron-clad reputation, great prices, super fast shipping, and the best customer service i've ever experienced.
it is  still a great camera but showing its age with only a 4.1 mp imaging sensor.
it is possible, just a question of self- control.
"that's the way it is".
add some fantastic filters (which digital users throw away  now) and accessories and you will be taking phenominal pictures no matter what.
shall we not suspend judgment until we have actually tried them?
arguing that shooting film is a more creative process  than shooting digital is like saying writing a novel with a pen and ink is more  creative than using a typewriter or computer.
if you dislike digital for some of the reasons vincent or i have brought up you can still use a digital camera like a film camera and make a decision to not use advanced digital editing or decide to not simply hold the trigger down and take thousands of photos at a location to get a few good ones.
but i also love  the grainless look of the digital.
i am sure you will  enjoy your eos3.
does the 5d has it all or is there any solid rumour of upcoming good  upgrades on it in the coming 6 month ?
reliability and durability i've had this eos 5d for nearly a year and it has survived a trip through  mexico and being vibrated for two cross-country helicopter trips.
obviously there is nothing better to them than  full-frame sensor in 5d but how really bad is with autofocus in 5d?
they are now approaching what i use to produce with my film camera.
while i was impressed with  the images, i'm disappointed that i'm returned the camera again.
viewfinder coverage on the canon eos 5d is standard for an advanced amateur single-lens reflex camera, about 96 percent of what is recorded on the sensor is displayed in the viewfinder.
any price that would fall more than, lets say,  20% or more out of that was proven to be a scam (in all cases).
the only disadvantage to having a full-frame sensor compared to a small-sensor digital slr body (canon digital rebel or any nikon) is that the small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses, which can be useful when you are doing sports or bird photography.
jeremey barrett , may 18, 2007; 12:22 a.m. robert (ingram), the sigma dc 17-70 is designed for aps-c sized sensors,  not full frame sensors like the 5d. the salesperson should absolutely have  known that and they should take it back, it simply won't produce usable images  on the 5d (light is only going to fall on portion of the sensor).
does the 5d has it all or is there any solid rumour of upcoming good upgrades on it in the coming 6 month ?
for my purposes, though, resolution and low light performance aren't huge issues, so my olympus e1 is actually better in other regards: much smaller and lighter, weatherproofed, and better lenses (in my price range).
my 20d exposes backlighting  perfectly and this camera costs over half as much of a 5d.
is full frame visibly sharper to the viewer than 1.6 at usual viewing distances?
i just can't seem to get a saturated look on the lcd  and it causes frustration during the shoot.

i'm no big fan of nikon, i just like the cameras  they make.
balancing flash and natural light is straightforward.
however, whilst there are many happy-snappers out there, who go from low resolution jpeg straight to printer, without so much as a mention of photoshop or the like, there are also photographers, amateur and professional, who are increasingly learning to understand and use the digital medium to great effect.

but if you are smart and creative and artistic (and do not  prefer to show this through computer illustration) but rather photography,  shoot film.
actually i've done exactly that, and you were right :(.
and you  don't even need electricity for that one!!
film is more organic and like many examples of older  technology it will always have its place and use and class (i have a fine omega  mechanical wristwatch; sure it isn't as accurate as a quartz watch but it has  class).
a real photographer is the one who composes the shot perfectly and with their knowledge and technical ability will be able to capture a beautiful photo in 1 single shot rather than taking hundreds and finding the best one.
collect cans and shoot weddings with a popcan pinhole array!
i currently own a 20d and prior to purchasing it had actually never used a "real" film camera (don't laugh but the only camera i had used was a single use disposable film camera).
it is also interesting to look here if you want to get one indicator of relative market shares for the various companies, not just canon and nikon--and not just at the high end.
if you're considering purchasing this camera from an online retailer, buyer beware.

i keep a small pocket-sized book with me with prints of my favorite photos.
all i'm finding are rumors.
an alternative is thecanon ef 24-105mm f/4 l is usm, (compare prices) (review), which has the advantages of light weight and image-stabilization at the cost of one f-stop in maximum aperture, which means that the viewfinder will be only half as bright.
p.m. hello all, i am in the market for a new pro camera - i currently do "pro" work with a nikon d70
i.e., sports photographers might want to consider one of the eos 1d bodies specifically designed for their rapid-fire needs.
i've read many posts regarding dust  issues right out of the box.
artistic film, and artistic digital photography are two different beasts.
i don't recommend using it.
if you decide to go the photoshop/bridge route, you might find the dam
yes, i chose my camera based on my requirements, and i recommended them on this site.
this is one area where the canon eos 1ds justifies its $7000 price with a  standard professional 100 percent viewfinder.
however i like to use lenses as with film cameras: no crop factor.
nikon is a small company with clever optical  engineers.
similarly, if we assert that digital photographers are  somehow disadvantaged by having to contend with the colour space  interpretations of a third-party, while not mentioning the colour bias  traditionally imparted by different makes of film, it seems nonsensical.
there is a nice hefty dose of text.
now that we are at this point, give me a linhof super technika only it is an 8x10 and a mountain of 8x10 polaroid film and a processor.
wow that would have been sweet.
philippe poussier , may 09, 2007; 11:27 a.m. thanks for the review first.
cody jorgensen , june 03, 2007; 06:28 p.m. i know that the first comment on this review, that discusses the debate between film vs.
i do notice  that sales are going up and higher resolution, better colours, less distortion  etc. is not the last reason for that :) and don't forget glass.
digital pictures are different but damn, some of  them are of wonderful color and quality.
i enjoy shooting with my elan7, as well as my canon 5d. i have  noticed a big difference in image quality going from my xti to the 5d.
i've had this eos 5d for nearly a year and it has survived a trip through mexico and being vibrated for two cross-country helicopter trips.
sure, i know it's a lot bigger than than the 20d and i've read all the who-ha of people praising it
perhaps i don't keep up as well  as when i had the business.
quico álvarez , december 05, 2007; 06:03 a.m. hi, folks: i am professional, and like that it is not the same to spend $2,000 than  $7,000, so i think that my choice should be the eos-5d. the only thing that  stops me is not be able to know if this camera's a/d conversion is 12 or 14  bits.
when i work i  constantly use the histogram and i need to make snap judgments based on the lcd  image and my exposure readings.
that's pretty sad, considering what a tour de force of technology the 5d's sensor is.
i have been using a 1d for the last 4 years.
brian cincotta , february 02, 2007; 04:58 p.m. tom, you made a comment and you said: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."
imagine all the gold coins and shillings you would collect!
because this is not a zoom lens, it has many fewer individual pieces of glass inside and therefore you'll get the highest possible contrast and image quality.
who knows where digital will take us in the future?
but in order to do that you first have to downsize the pictures to match the beamer's resoloution, which is somewhat less than 1.75mp if it is bang up to date and hd-ready with 1080i.
i used bronicas and a number of canon bodies and lenses.
so, please tell me that canon did some progress in this case in 5d best regards radek buck lovell , july 13, 2007; 05:44 p.m. philip greenspuns very ignorant statement in his review "the small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses" bring into question his entire review.
the best  professional solution isadobe photoshop cs2, which comes with an image editing  tool called "adobe bridge".
guido ersettigh (milan) , october 08, 2006; 05:45 p.m. claudia our friend knows well perspective theory in fact he used a lens that lets you basculate its axis in order to correct perspective distortion along one direction - optical bank lets you move, thanks to the bellow system, in any direction so you can correct distortion along any axis or put an whole item in focus even if it's not parallel to the lens -.
and the 50d with its big pixel count in a small crop sensor and the full frame 5d mk ii are both more capable in their noise reduction and in other ways.
it is the same as film and digital to me,  you end up with a photograph at the end but they are not the same.
but in order to do that you first have to downsize the pictures to  match the beamer's resoloution, which is somewhat less than 1.75mp if it is  bang up to date and hd-ready with 1080i.
its just my personal opinion just like  anyone else's on this site.
at the 10k  range, the benefit of mf is obvious, the single pixel size (pitch) is much  larger (8.4um) than the 1ds mkiii's 6.4um.
the canon 5d mark 2 has generally been given rave reiviews and has be  tagged as the wedding photographers camera of choice.
the picasa program from google also  can understand the eos 5d's .cr2 raw files.
robert ingram , may 11, 2007; 12:39 p.m. i just bought a canon 5d. apparently, the salesperson did not know what they were talking about, because he encouraged me to buy the canon 5d with the sigma dc 17-70 f/2.8 lens.
and you will have spent a lot less than 3000 i guarantee.
camera is just great, but for the tse system... http://www.jb-avril.com tony (anthony) rowell , july 08, 2006;

the only exception to this rule is if you try to  take pictures continuously at a rate that exceeds three photos per second.
however, digital still-image capture is still very much in its  infancy, when compared to the length of time that film has been with us.
check out thomas hawk's photos  www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk which are never shot with a flash and he often  shoots in very lowlight at iso 1600.
i've also lost a lot of digital files  over the years, but i still have our old slides from the 1960's.
antonio (italy) , october 13, 2006; 03:46 p.m. hi to all!
note that, as with most digital single lens reflex cameras, the 5d cannot provide you with a preview in the rear lcd because the sensor is occluded by the viewing mirror until you press the shutter release.
you will have more fun.
so for many looking for a full frame caera a used 5d may well still be a good buy.
(seemy photoshop directory for some useful scripts, including those that were used to generate the jpegs you see on this page.)
why would i spend extra money on development and enlargement on a photo that cannot even be manipulated on basic levels that is such commonplace in digital photography today?
nothing like objectivity. .
i love my canon digital rebel!
i would also, obviously, love their to be a price reduction, but that might be wishful thinking.
instead of buying a wider lens i opted to go with a bigger frame 5d. best regards.
the richness and detail of his photos at 1600 are amazing.
if you're going to take a lot of portraits, e.g., of a baby, and don't  want to endure the weight of the 70-200/2.8, consider a primecanon ef 100mm f/2  usm, (compare prices) (review).
if you do not create your art and have a bonafide craft in digital art (like making fantastic looking things painstakingly in photoshop or other based primarily on visions in your head), then you are basically putting your faith in those who decided how a certain color etc. should be rendered on a screen ie color spaces, color balance and the like.
a good image is a good image  whether it was shot on film, with digital, or hand drawn on the back of a  stained bar coaster.
i have covered a summarised review on my website: http://digital_camera_reviews.protechltd.com folarin s , february 05, 2009; 09:00 p.m. as a new member on photo.net,i have to say that many of the above views relating to the respective merits of film vs. digital and full frame vs 1.6 crop factor have been tremendously helpful.
when i got my 5d things changed, there are no 'cheat' modes on this  camera, you actually have to know what you are doing.
olympus today announced a new micro four thirds body, the e-m5.
the camera has an internal buffer memory for rapid sequence photography  (17 raws or 60 jpegs).
needless to say i am still using my 20d for demanding shoots, but i am considering a 1d mark iii or a 1ds mark ii.
i've seen some great stuff from my students using pin-hole cameras.
it is the  first in what olympus is calling it's om-d line of micro four thirds bodies.
p.m. anyone know when canon will be updating the 5d?
ok...for a photojournalist, a sport phtographer, a reporter like for a  "common user" a digital vs. film question simply makes no sense.
when working with raw images, this is rather sluggish on all but the very newest and most powerful pcs.
landrum kelly , july 19, 2007; 09:10 a.m.go nikon!
perspective is a natural resolt of that...
all this competition is really going to benefit everybody here.
digital cameras and the digital workflow have made creating or capturing a  great image much easier and much more likely for novice and amateur  photographers (i admit i am one of these people however i have a "moral  code" regarding the level of digital adjustments i will make).

the bigger the film the better!
the canon always looks to me like reduced, i guess it is the color palette, or the cmos sensors.
i suggest mr. greenspun do a little more research before making completely invalid statements which mislead camera buyers and uniformed photographers.
