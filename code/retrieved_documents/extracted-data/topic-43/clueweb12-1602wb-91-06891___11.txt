my advise though, is to do a lot of research before you make your decision.
that being said, i suspect that if i were starting over again, i would probably go with sony.
your utility depends upon your preferences.
there is a rising population of recent retirees  and i've heard long-time birders comment (complain) about the number of new  birders out and around with cameras.
the d3200 has the same expeed 3 processor as the d4/d800, so will be very quick at processing the large amounts of info coming from that 24.2 mp sensor.

the just announced camera will have the very latest technology available.
no one should apply their personal utility to recommend a certain choice someone else.
who is online users browsing this forum:
if canon and other companies did a smart market analysis on their customers and potential customers, they might adjust their marketing approach to accommodate this new market driven by recent retirees who are engaged in a hobby where light super telephoto lenses are very nice to have.
canon seems to be developing on a top-down basis,  rather than bottom-up.
he decided he wanted to switch to canon (this was a few years ago) and convinced canon to switch him out for free.
two cameras are the best for me (features and price).
not to say the canon is a slouch (it's not, it's just an older camera).
joined: nov 21 4:50 pm posts: 74 hi this is a good debate..
it is very new and hasn't yet been tested for performance but word is that it will have similar performance to the d5100/d7000 class which is according to dxo having much better image quality, dynamic range, bit color depth among other things than the eos 60d.
canon's new  super telephotos are expected to offer superb performance, but again at super  prices.
generally if demand rises, you manufacture more and manufacturing costs per unit decline (fixed costs are recovered over a greater number of units plus gains from economies of scale).

you have to understand your own preferences (utility) and constraints and make your own decision.
that being said, i suspect that if  i were starting over again, i would probably go with sony.
they don't know where to go.
i am new to birding and am also retired from the workforce.
i had a friend who was a very successful  sports photographer (official photographer for the ioc, that sort of success).
i have a few bodies and lenses, and everything is interchangeable.
there is some truth in that.
that is, one of my preferences would be to suffer a little now, but gain  in the long run (a guess).
you will have a month or so before the d3200 is available which should give you enough time to decide.
posted: apr 19 7:15 pm senior member joined: mar 28 9:51 am posts: 345 location: maple ridge liron, there are guys on this forum that are much more qualified to answer that question than me.
right now, nikon is stronger than all others, but i suspect that in the long run, sony will win out.
although couplers are available to use lenses from one manufacturer  on cameras from another manufacturer, i am leery of such devices.
the other  thing is the video features of the d3200 will most likely be better than the  eos 60d.

the d300s has been the unofficial "benchmark" nikon bird camera for a while now, so the d400 should be of interest to many bird photographers.
he  handed over his nikon gear and canon gave him the equivalent canon gear for  free.

the dxo ratings just become more evident when getting into the finer details like pixel peeping, photo enlargements, color reproduction, etc.
canon seems to be developing on a top-down basis, rather than bottom-up.
i will soon be upgrading my hybrid nikon coolpix p100 camera to a dslr (and lens tha gives me at least 400mm).
it will be at a higher price point though.
i find this to be a nice hobby that gets me outdoors, gives me exercise and engages the brain in devising "hunting" strategies.
you can analyze thousands of pages of reviews and the internet is full of "advice" on which one will be the "ultimate".
nikon is doing some amazing things  with their dslr sensors as of late.
if i had no constraints and given my set of preferences, i would choose the nikon from your set of choices.

another thing you have to keep in mind is that bodies come and go, and in the end you'll spend a bigger portion of your budget on a lens/lenses than on bodies.
the eos 60d on the plus side will shoot faster fps, have longer battery  life, a faster shutter speed (1/8000 compared to 1/4000) among other things  (the average person will prob not need more than 1/4000 though).
as one person i encountered in the field recently said to me, "canon is lost.
so i will be getting a canon 100mm-400mm as that will fit into my budget.
for example, their flagship dslr, the eos-1ds was recently discontinued, being replaced by the eos-1d x. canon was charging around $7000 for the discontinued model, but its features now longer justified such a price.

under normal circumstances both cameras will do fine for the average person.
most of us have financial constraints, for example, but the dollar amount is likely different for each person.

like everything else everything is a personal choice and for me this is what works...
you  have to understand your own preferences (utility) and constraints and make your  own decision.
that is,  they are offering features to justify high prices, not to satisfy existing or  potential customers.
and i finally went with the canon 7d and as i was on a tight budget i went with the 150mm - 500mm sigma i am happy with this but will say i have found a few soft spots with this lens
canon's new super telephotos are expected to offer superb performance, but again at super prices.

the other thing is the video features of the d3200 will most likely be better than the eos 60d.
you may also want to wait for the d400 or whatever the d300s replacement will be called.

this web site features a birders discussion forum, links to birding newsgroups, articles and book reviews, checklists, regional hotspots, photo gallery, weather reports, and visiting birder information.
about the only thing i can say for sure is that it makes sense to stick with the system you choose originally.
you want to maximize your (photographic)  utility subject to certain constraints.

right now, nikon is  stronger than all others, but i suspect that in the long run, sony will win  out.
it seems that what canon is doing is to move more into video  features where they can charge a lot - like $15000 for a recent model.

they are: canon eos 60d (and the 400mm f5.6 canon lens) nikon d3200 (and the nikon 80-400mm lens)
