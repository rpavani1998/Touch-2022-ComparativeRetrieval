their active participation helps to generate a dynamicphotography community for fellow enthusiasts and professionals at the same ability level or with the same interest in any type of photography.for digital photography, as a whole, the nikon d3 was definitely a major game-changer, especially because its greater iso sensitivity captures better images in low light.the 12.1-mega-pixel, full-frame (36 x 24 mm) sensor is also a breath of fresh air, as the d3s produces exceptional image quality from nikon’s raw file format, 14-bit uncompressed nefs (nikon electronic format).the dx format has its place for many digital photography assignments, but the 1.2x-crop mode should pique the interest of action photographers, which is one of nikon’s primary target markets for the d3s.another significant improvement found in the nikon d3s is the larger buffer, which allows for very acceptable images in lower light and more than 30 raw frames in one burst.a third-party test demonstrated the d3s’s capability to generate photos at iso 12,800 and greater that register details and precise color and are free of banding.select iso sensitivities above 6,400 and the d3s gives any photographer a one-stop advantage over the canon eos 1d mark iv, for example.a digital photography community for photographers of all skill levels to share their knowledge & discuss techniques.what excites digital photographers the most about the d3s’s video capabilities is that it can shoot video throughout the entire iso sensitivity range, including the “high-sensitivity” mode, to iso 102,400.these improvements may not, at first, seem to be giant leaps forward, but any advances of dslr capabilities at this level are likely to be viewed as jumping a chasm to the photographers who need what the d3s delivers.the resolution may be the same as the d90, the first nikon dslr that could shoot video, but the d3s has contrast-detection af (auto-focus) during filming and supports a plug-in stereo microphone.nikon has chosen to design the d3s to produce greater image quality at high iso sensitivities, which does limits resolution, but this is the trade-off photographers must contemplate before plunking down $5,200 to $6,400 for the d3s body.sellers are not only able to list common items, such as camera bodies, lenses, various accessories and digital camcorders, but also darkroom apparatus, underwater photography gear, printers, scanners and software.sellers can also enhance that exposure by adding photos and various style and placement upgrades.these include photography techniques and tips, new equipment announcements and reviews, workshop trips and schedules, camera company histories and biographies of some of the most influential and honored photographers.
