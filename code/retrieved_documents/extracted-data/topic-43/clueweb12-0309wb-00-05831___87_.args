the lens is very sharp, has crisp edge definition, and does a superb job of separating and defining colors and tones.rangefinder cameras can’t frame accurately, can’t focus closer than a couple of feet, have trouble aligning near and far parts of the subject precisely (parallax), and won’t work with zoom lenses - but are very quiet and smooth.the evf combines rangefinder quiet and smoothness with slr-like framing, focus range, and zoom capability - at the cost of an unpleasant view and slow (if eventually accurate) visual focusing.it changes drastically the approach to photography, the way the photographer interacts with the subject and widens the possibilities a lot.the iso 100 image quality is extremely good - challenging the results from film scans with twice as many pixels due to the lens’s outstanding resolution.autofocus is fairly good and fast, but in low light situations, the camera often is unable to focus at all, forcing me to switch to manual mode, and often causing me to miss shots entirely.the leica-designed lens is almost supernatural in its ability to define details and separate tones and colors, and pushes right to the limits of what 5 megapixels can record - a bonus i wasn’t even expecting.the digital zoom is okay for amateur use and can be used on some rare occassions.by making massive repetitive errors like this, leica shows some classic business mis-steps that could lead to its demise.i have read all the reports as to what the leicas can and can't do and my position today is that they give me a sense of image capturing where what i see is what i get, not what a camera/computer interprets.no other digicam has a lens this valuable and leica is renown for premium quality premium priced optics.needless to say, the images are great, and like many other reviewers and users acclaimed, the image is the key, and a bit of noise can always be cleared up with a variety of tools, including noise ninja, kodak gem pro, and others.the most startling thing about digital color is that, properly white balanced, it is remarkably clean and free from color casts compared to chemical imaging/scanning.it's size, shape, and weight are ideal and thus, makes it very versatile.as with all digital zooms, it simply magnifies the image from the middle of the sensor, without gathering any more detail.
