for everyone else, the gxr is simply a joy to use for any photographer that wants full control over their camera, with proven handling and a seemingly infinite level of customisation.the high resolution lcd provides a wide viewing angle and high contrast., with a special fluorine coat and hard coating to help prevent scratches, and 100% srgb coverage for more accurate color reproduction.the choice of the 50mm macro lens is also interesting, in that a focal length of 50mm is useful for street photography as well as close-ups of flowers, providing an angle of view roughly equivalent to human vision, and the fast maximum aperture of f/2.5 is a real benefit for low-light shooting and creating that out-of-focus bokeh look.utilising a magnesium alloy body, the gxr is an extremely well-built camera, continuing the long-established ricoh tradition of producing serious photographic tools.in practice it produces a subtle but noticeable effect that is particularly useful for capturing more natural portraits when using flash.this is perfectly acceptable for its main use as a dedicated macro lens, but makes it less suitable for street photographer where every second counts.focusing with the 24-72mm camera unit is quick in good light, taking less than 0.5 seconds, and the camera happily achieves focus most of the time indoors or in low-light situations.in summary the ricoh gxr is a remarkably intuitive and customisable camera, especially considering that it's a first-generation product in a completely new photographic system.ricoh are claiming that this new approach allows them to offer the best combinations of image quality and portability - one of the gxr’s key selling points is its diminutive size, being much smaller than a traditional dslr and even tinier than the panasonic gf1 and olympus e-p1/e-p2 micro four thirds cameras.further appealing to the avid photographer in you, the ricoh gxr has a range of focusing and metering modes that should cover most situations.this means that you can use both the camera's auto-focus system by half-pressing the shutter button, and over-ride it to instantly shoot at at a pre-determined distance without having to wait for the camera to focus.digital slr’s allow you to change the lens on the front of the camera - the gxr allows you to change the lens and the image sensor, which are combined into a single interchangeable unit.level compensation allows you to correct the contrast and tone of an image after it has been taken, and white balance compensation the white balance.with a traditional dslr, changing the lens exposes the image sensor, with dust inevitably finding its way onto it.with a conventional dslr, it's inherently much easier to change the lens and retain the same sensor - with the gxr system, at least on launch, you have to accept the change of both lens and sensor, and the particular combinations on offer.
