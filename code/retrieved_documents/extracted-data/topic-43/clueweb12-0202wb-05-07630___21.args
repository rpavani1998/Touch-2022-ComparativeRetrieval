the lens isn't usm but does have image stabilisation built in.
of course the maximum the aperture can go to in aperture-priority is f/8 which isn't ideal for landscape shots but is better than f/3.2 that landscape mode chose.
another problem gained from such close focusing is the lack of light entering the lens.

this equates to around 153,666 pixels and means more detail can be seen in playback and when monitoring for manual focus or noise detection.
iso80 is lovely with sharp detail on the petals.
there's plenty to do on the g10 and it should help you out of plenty of scrapes when you don't have your dslr.
from the 28mm wide angle lens is also still operated by the zoom rocker with its diminutive size and recognisable springiness.
now watch the video review: sample photos from the x-s1, the latest premium bridge camer... daniel bell takes a closer look at the olympus sh-21.
he said that this is an extension of the optical zoom but in my further tests, the image breaks down in a similar way to the digital
this causes a thin focal plane which can be seen running along the lettering on the headphones
because of the results shown, it looks like noise problems will dog this classification for some time.
what mike is saying is that the breaking up of the image wasn't from the zoom actually being digital but simply the fact that the resolution is so low.
the rear screen has been improved upon with a higher resolution of 461,000dots.
he also failed to mention that the optical zoom bar is white.
the chrome buttons designated to the playback, power and shutter release have also been turned black.
i'm left with one question though; when you wrote: "it's unfortunate they've not really improved on noise performance ", and looking at the test shots you took with the g9, it actually looks to me like the noise performance of the g10 is quite a bit worse than that of the g9.
the skin tone colour is the same as the g9 but the primary colours look more saturated.
it was a bright day when i took them and set the white balance to the sunshine setting.
it's unfortunate they've not really improved on noise performance and i think this could be the only thing that limits the g10.
it also goes as wide at 28mm which is great for landscape photographers but with a wider bottom end comes a lower top end and the smaller zoom to previous models reaches a maximum 140mm.

i like the colour reproduction on the colour chart image and the mono tones have also come out nicely balanced.
it's not overtly annoying and certainly has an underlying advantage with creating more space to place the new dial on the top.
the back of the unit looks similar to the g9 with the slight exception of the buttons being made larger and any writing has now been printed directly onto the corresponding button.
in turn this can then be assigned to the face detection which ensures faces are perfectly exposed and focused.
portrait mode has given a blue cast despite the white balance put to the correct setting.
so, yes with the white zoom bar the image is magnified etc by using moving optics i.e. a zoom lens.
while iso800 has the purple blobs in the shadow area and a distinct loss of detail in the petals, it's not threatening enough to worry over.
the mound of dials doesn't look altogether unpleasant though.
alternatively, the panasonic lumix dmc-lx3 at £318 has a 2.5x optical zoom, non-dedicated external hotshoe, no optical viewfinder and raw recording.
this detail doesn't leave but problems have started to leak through at iso200.
build quality on the camera is awesome its a shame it cant do the job!
unfortunately, there's no such input from the canon iso integration department (i made that up) and noise remains terrible at high settings.
it could also simply be that canon are listening to the public and that's what they asked for.
but it's the little touches such as the metal tripod bush and solid plastic port covers instead of rubber ones that make the difference.

obviously this causes problems with a narrow depth of field but using a smaller f/18 or similar aperture would give longer exposures unless the iso is cranked up.
the shadow on the background is soft and hardly noticeable but one thing i did notice was the green line of fringing around the top of the head.
macro gets as close as 1cm, just be careful of the shadow caused by the lens and top of the camera.
noise test i was initially surprised that the g10 only goes to iso1600 with the release of the eos 50d and 5d mkii at the same time and their obvious advancements in noise control.
this means that a yellow bar is neither digital nor optical zoom.
the main menu is brighter and has larger writing.
the aperture-priority landscape image.
the reason that it chose this aperture value is so it could use iso80 to give as smooth an image as possible.
add to that all of the theme menu, which is a waste of memory and you've a few items that either you don't want to or don't need to use.
the exposure compensation wheel can be seen with the new location of the iso dial on the opposite side of the hotshoe.
the back of the unit looks similar to the g9 with the slight exception of the buttons being made larger and any writing has now been printed directly onto the corresponding button.
in safety zoom mode, you have a lower resolution and so there are pixels not used, instead of down-resing the image (lowering the resolution), as is normally done in digital zoom i.e. 15 down to 10 using the cameras internal software.
it's great to be able to get so close into your subject although out of all the angles i tried with this photograph of the headphones, this was the only one that didn't cast a shadow from the top of the camera and lens.
an updated pro 1 is well overdue, the feature worked very well in the original
the panasonic lx3 looks like it might steal canon`s crown as no.1 dslr backup.
in this instance it has forced the camera to open the aperture to f/2.8 in order to expose correctly.
the new technology is an added bonus with the dig!c iv processor speeding things up while the face detection self timer will help those of you specialising in self portraits.
focusing and metering the canon powershot g10 offers plenty of overriding features for focusing.
face detection works well and can even have metering tied to it.
when you get to the maximum optical length, reducing the resolution then changes the digital area to yellow.
i like the colour reproduction on the colour chart image and the mono tones have also come out nicely balanced.
the best shot dial sits on top of the iso dial which used to be on the opposite side.
in turn this can then be assigned to the face detection which ensures faces are perfectly exposed and focused.
this really surprises me as i would've thought it to be faster than that especially as the g9 gave results of around the 0.08sec mark.
some options such as flash control access a wider sub menu.
the newly released dig!c iv processor has been installed into the g10 which, canon say, is roughly 1.3x faster than the dig!c iii that is found in the g9.
the similarities in both shots makes me wonder why they bother with the landscape mode at all.
i thought we'd see a bit of that technology rub off on the high end compacts and at least see a boost to iso6400.
so it's using the optical magnification plus crop factor and no interpolation or down-resing.
like the g9, the g10 offers a macro facility that can get as close as 1cm.
i took into account that the g10 has a higher resolution than the g9 so will naturally suffer more.
the great thing about the latter two are that they can work as usual or they can be assigned to the flexizone and collaborate with the focusing.
the image looks too soft in the background for my tastes.
the reason that it chose this aperture value is so it could use iso80 to give as smooth an image as possible.

this is by far the best review,video, i have read, easy to understand and the video, is quite impressive.
specification at £421, the canon powershot g10 offers a 5x optical zoom, external hotshoe, optical viewfinder and raw recording.
to be fair, this is at full size enlargement and for me, the image doesn't become unbearable until iso1600 anyway.
he explained this under the logical premise that on the zoom bar, digital zoom is signified by a blue bar.
a square on front or rear view best shows the chimney-like stack of dials on the right shoulder.
the two main menus are still available with the function button, which is located in the centre of the location pad that sits in the middle of the thumb dial, giving access to the quick functions such as resolution, white balance, bracketing and the neutral density filter.
the detail on both shots is great but a slight purple line from fringing is detectable on the white bars.
safety zoom uses a cropped area of the sensor that matches the resolution being used and then the optical zoom.
the size of the flexizone af square can be adjusted by pressing the af button just above the thumb wheel/navigation pad ensemble.
this button also doubles as the delete function when you're in playback mode and discretly erasing all the blurry pictures that you never admit to taking.
this could be a nod towards the recent love of hdr photography by a lot of people.
, the canon powershot g10 looks remarkably similar to it's older brother the g9.
the cast is a bit too strong for my taste although it's not something that can't be fixed in post.
when you get to the maximum optical length, reducing the resolution then changes the digital area to yellow.
the main menu is exhaustive and would take an age to cover everything but needless to say there are some interesting features in there such as i-contrast which is canon's version of the nikon d-lighting, image stabiliser adjust, servo af, flash control which then accesses a sub-menu for these settings and drive settings for a new self portrait feature which i'll cover in the focus and metering area of the review.
metering options are accessed from the button on the opposite corner of the d-pad and you can choose from centre-weighted, evaluative and spot.
unfortunately, there's no such input from the canon iso integration department (i made that up) and noise remains terrible at high settings.
these accommodate the regular best shot dial on the top with the iso dial sat below.
with the results of the noise test i can see why they didn't simply put a couple more setting in and i think the high resolution and small sensor can partly be to blame for this.
i like the grass colour which doesn't change through either picture but is a realistic reproduction.

other features that aren't so welcome include safety mf which is a feature that overrides any of your settings if the camera thinks that the photograph might be incorrectly exposed.
fill in flash has given a warmer tone to the image and added catchlights to the eyes.
at the launch of the canon powershot g10, i was told by one of the technical departments henchmen that the 5x optical zoom can be increased by simply adjusting the resolution of the camera.
ephotozine, the web's friendliest photography community.
setting the camera up in the same way as a normal self portrait with the timer, it takes a photograph two seconds after it detects a new face in the frame.
i originally thought that maybe the newer photograph was slightly under exposed but the lights are at a uniform setting and the skin tone tile looks the same.
