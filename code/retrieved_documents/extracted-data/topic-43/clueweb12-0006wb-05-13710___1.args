the black paint finish was invented for fondlers and is awfully impractical for a user.
i have read in some other posts that the mp black tend to peel out easily to reveal the brass inside (supposed to be coo!).
but from reading some previous posts (yes, i have done the search) it seems that a black mp can be much worse.
after a few years of use my m6 had scratches at the bottom and black colour peeled off around the corners.
now i miss the m feeling so much(and believe it or not, i produce more "snapshots" with the d60 and imho less artistic photos than with an m).
but the chrome is a more durable finish without doubt.

anyway, i like both black and chrome and can't make up my mind.
it will be scratched and flaked to hell very quickly if you really use the camera, just like the voigtlander cosina painted brass lenses.

but i have also heard (correct me if this is not true) that chrome finish can "bubble" after a few years of use.
the idea that it is for 'fondlers' only comes from people who worry about resale value, and can't imagine a camera that shows any signs of use.

that kind of worn-off does not bother me.
the black paint on the mp is much tougher than the old paint used on m3 and m2 cameras.
i wonder why leica don't produce a pre-brassed finish which would please the users and delight the fondlers (they could lie to the very few who aren't bored that it saw service in iraq).
i have used an m6 for about 5- 7 years before i sold it and bought d60 and a few canon lenses.

the chrome finish should be quite bulletproof which will allow you to use the camera without being obsessed with not letting it touch anything.

i like black cameras in general because they are less visible and more discreet, but if i were you i would pass on the black paint mp.
