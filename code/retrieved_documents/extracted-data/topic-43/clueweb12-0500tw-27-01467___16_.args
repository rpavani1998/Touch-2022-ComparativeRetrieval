both 5d mk iii & d800 are fantastic cameras, they both excel at some features and lack at others – thus providing specific needs of specific market segments.the 14-24mm lens and 24-120 cover most options for me as a photo-journalist.i have invested “a coin or two” in canon glass, but that is no issue at all – i’m going to sell them all with basically no loss and buy equivalent nikon alternatives.i really like the sound of the pixel based metering of d800, time-lapse support, higher pixel count, built-in flash (for fill) water-resistance, and potential to use an f4 lens with 2x and still get af.i’m absolutely convinced in both, just d800 fits better for me and seems to be better value for the money.nonetheless, both cameras are excellent.both cameras appear to be fantastic and we are all winners.absolutely no doubts 5dmk3 will take amazing pictures, just the same applies to d800 (maybe save for iso12800 which might be better on canon due to pixel size but that doesn’t bother me at all as i rarely see iso1600).i’m canon shooter converting to nikon, but that does not take away excellent quality of either.love the low light options, speed that it offers.we thought about throwing in the canon eos-1d x and the nikon d4, but those are approximately $3,000 more so they’re in a different class.mar, 2012 by planetmitch in 5d mk ii, 5d3, d800 one of the first things people start doing when a new camera like the canon eos 5d mark iii is announced is compare it to other cameras in its class… so we knew you’d want thatyes when you compare some cameras maybe you want to give an extra 5 to 10 minutes to get the specs from the manufacturer.this alone help me to make a change, moving to sony or nikon, may be a fs100 that i can get a adapter or just sell all fo my canon lenses and move to kikon, because of the size of the sensor i belief i am moving to nikon and just them after a fs100 replacement go back to video cameras.like or dislike: 1  3 reply to this comment d800 also has in-camera hdr, ae lock and a self cleaning sensor.
