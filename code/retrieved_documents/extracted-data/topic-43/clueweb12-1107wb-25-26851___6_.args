but they share enough nice features to classify both cameras as very worthy successors to the cameras that they replace.the nikon d700 does have an excellent autofocus (af) system.from this we can conclude that it is likely that the performance at higher iso values is comparable to the nikon d700.if this is the case it would mean that the 5d mark iii would perform similar to the nikon d3s, which is the top notch camera at the moment (by a mile) when it comes to image quality at high iso’s.the canon 5d mark ii has very similar high iso performance to the nikon d700.the nikon d800 is seen as the direct competitor to the canon 5d mark iii.others, for example landscape and architecture photographers, are really happy with the increase in sensor resolution.the pluses of the d700 are the excellent af system and the very good iso performance.the nikon d700 has a continuous shooting speed of 5 frames per second (fps), and even 8 fps with its battery grip attached.the iso range of this camera goes up to 25,600, which is the same as it’s predecessor the d700.in addition to that, the d700 had very good high iso performance, which can still be considered very good today, almost 4 years later.the nikon d800 replaces the nikon d700, which was also a very highly acclaimed camera.but, like i said, we will have to wait until these camera’s are available to the public to see how the specifications translate to actual real world performance.i have not been able to do a hands-on comparison of these two cameras yet, simply because they are not yet for sale.field tests will have to show how these camera’s really compare to each other and their predecessors.
