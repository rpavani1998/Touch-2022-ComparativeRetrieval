the camera features a dedicated video record button, accessible regardless of the mode dial position, meaning you can apply creative effects to videos for example.

it's also 10% smaller than d5000, and has a 17% thinner tft in comparison.
as you would  expect the dslr has a metal tripod mount, and there are a number of dedicated  buttons on the camera including: flash, function (default timer button, can be  customised), dedicated video recording, exposure, plus more.
simon  highlighted three key features that make the d5100 stand out: the new  horizontal opening 3 inch screen is designed as the best approach for use with  a tripod or video work.
there is also a built in af illuminator for when you are in less than ideal lighting situations.
colour sketch hdr miniature night vision selective colour silhouette effects: low  key, high key, miniature, selective colour, colour  sketch, silhouette, night vision, and new hdr mode (combines two  shots, upto +/- 3 ev).
nikon's market share continues to grow at the expense of canon and others in  the uk market, with nikon the number one dslr seller in march.
the retouch menu is worth  highlighting as there is a large number of options available  including: d-lighting, red-eye correction, trim, monochrome,  filter effects, colour balance, resize, image overlay, raw processing, quick  retouch, straighten, distortion control, fisheye, colour outline, perspective  control, colour sketch, miniature effect, selective colour, and movie editing.
add comment  jargon buster:  off features verdict specification the nikon d5100 is the latest digital slr from nikon and  significantly updates and improves upon the d5000, including improved swivel  screen, new effects, and full hd video mode.
these are jpeg only, and it does not record a raw file at the same time as the effects modes.
it's also 10% smaller than d5000, and  has a 17% thinner tft in comparison.

it's also reasonably easy to access the  battery compartment.
with the well known and well respected 16mp cmos  sensor from the nikon d7000, it should be able to offer improved low light, low  noise photography and theoretically better image quality, in fact, you should  get the same excellent nikon d7000 image quality, but at a much more wallet  friendly price.
i suspect nikon are onto a real winner here, and we will be giving the complete verdict when we review the production dslr in the next couple of weeks.

a full array of connections on the side provide hdmi, external microphone, usb, gps connections.
videos are recorded in the h.264 mov file format (instead of m-jpeg on d5000), and lower resolutions, such as 720p are also available.
