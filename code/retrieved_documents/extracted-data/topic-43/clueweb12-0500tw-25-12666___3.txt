- new af module capable of focusing at low light down to -2ev.
quiet shooting mode.
improved weather sealing and durable magnesium alloy construction.
- multiple exposures.
the information presented here is not official canon information, but a very  reliable leak a few hours before the actual announcement.
depth of field  preview?) button close to the shutter release.
a few observations about the 5dm3′s design (based solely on the  leaked pictures): canon has finally fixed the position of the on/off switch from near the  back lower right of the lcd to the top of the camera, behind the main mode  selector.
the ‘menu and info buttons have moved up from their previous  positions to the left of the viewfinder.
a full-frame sensor (36mm x 24mm) has the same physical dimensions as 35mm film.
5 fps with  battery grip, 6 fps in dx mode.
- 100% viewfinder coverage.
full hd 1080 movie, including raw hd output over hdmi.
most consumer dslrs have smaller sensors, called aps-c sensors (25mm x 16mm, which stands for advanced photo system type-classic).
the ‘eos 5d’ badge is more 7d like.
- 51 point autofocus with 15 cross-type sensors.

51 point autofocus with 15 cross-type sensors.
- 4.0 frames per second continuous shooting.
- 61 point autofocus, up to 41 cross type sensors.
a new ‘start/stop’ button has been added to the right side of  the viewfinder.
apart from that, the top bank of  buttons near the top lcd are the same.
this seems to be a dedicated video recording button.

this makes it much better in terms of quickly turning on the camera and shooting.
shutter durability of 200,000 cycles.
it’s specifications list is quite impressive: 36.3 megapixel full frame cmos sensor.
full-frame cameras, by virtue of their large sensors, have much better low-light performance, color rendition, dynamic range (the range of levels it can show between highlight and shadow) than their aps-c cousins.
last month, nikon came back roaring to release the d800.
- iso 100-6400 (expandable to lo1: 50, hi2: 25600).
it had great video shooting capabilities-
- high dynamic range (hdr) mode which combines multiple exposures upto +/-
there is also an additional (probably picture control) button between the selector wheel and joystick at the back.

my comparison of the feature set of these two photography stalwarts coming  up.
- full hd 1080 movie, including raw hd output over hdmi.
- price (rumored): $3,500.
there is  also an additional (probably picture control) button between the selector wheel  and joystick at the back.
any further difference in pictures- almost always- is because of the person using it, and not the camera.
an additional button added to the front, at approximately 8 o’clock  when the mount is viewed from the front.
- shutter durability of 200,000 cycles.
but first, a quick question- q-
there is a new ‘rate’  button, second from top in the row of buttons on the left side of the lcd.
the d700 did have a superior autofocus (af) system, but that was really about it.
you also tend to get shallower depth of field for the same aperture on a full-frame than on an aps-c camera.

the differences are more for their handling and features over and above great iq.

canon’s full-frame dslr- called the 5d mark2- till yesterday was by far the most popular full-frame camera.
- improved metering which allows better scene recognition, including face detection.

something that its competitor- the nikon d700 completely  lacked; a higher megapixel sensor, and was overall lighter than the d700.
tonight, canon will release their next iteration- the 5d mark iii.
