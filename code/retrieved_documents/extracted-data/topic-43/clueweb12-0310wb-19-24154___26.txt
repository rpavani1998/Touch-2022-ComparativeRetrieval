this  translates into real time savings while editing, another positive trait of the  s2.
they are without question some of the best lenses i  have ever used if not outright the best lenses i have ever experienced.
i never even looked at the users manual, and i had absolutely no difficulty  using the camera.
the phaseone lenses in my experience seem to have less  focus shift.
i would say that this is proof that the tweener  concept is a great one.
all s2 lenses will be manufactured in two versions: a standard version that  requires the use of the focal plane shutter in the camera and a “central  shutter” (leica’s name for a leaf shutter type lens) version with  the shutter built into the lens.
the leica s2, however, seems more accurate in terms of certain colors like foliage, deep red fabrics and blue skies, and the color palette saturates more naturally to the eye than the phaseone does.
hasselblad lenses have leaf shutters.
it fits  somewhere between a 35 mm full frame dslr and a medium format camera.
those folks interested in seeing the differences for themselves, should  borrow the cameras, shoot some images and make their own prints.
i have always been a fan of leica ergonomics, and the s2 does not disappoint.
as i have mentioned many times in the  past, because of their low resolution and the restricted color gamut of most  monitors (let alone the fact that few people properly calibrate and profile  their monitors), pixel peeping on a monitor is not a proper way to judge  image quality.
– much less vibration during the actual exposure if the camera is used in mirror-up mode.
i continue to marvel at how m9 prints hold up much better than canon or  nikon prints when you go big.
the purpose of the article is to try to describe my early impressions on  the camera from a practical point of view as a photographer, as opposed to as a  scientist or an engineer.
conclusion the s2 system is a superb capture instrument.

as you will see below, the s2 image quality is squarely in high quality medium format territory.

i will let the reader decide whether leica made a major tactical blunder by not having a relatively full lens line available at the time that the new system was introduced.

____________________________________________________________________________________ the s2 system is a superb capture instrument.
well, it is neither.
i prefer the color rendition of the s2, and i give it the number one spot in terms of color reproduction.
as far as i know, phaseone does not make any corrections to compensate for focus shift; phaseone users simply have to live with it.
finally,  focus shift could make matters worse if it goes the wrong way.
in my images, the s2  lenses definitely exhibit absolutely superb performance in every respect,  sharpness, contrast, color rendition, total lack of chromatic aberration,  evenness of illumination from edge to edge and corner to corner, negligible  geometric distortions, etc.
once enough lenses become available, this could easily become the system of choice for a number of serious photographers.
but, the tree is not at infinity.

by mark dubovoy introduction
for a detailed technical description, i recommend the articles  written about it inleica fotografie magazine.
to the naked eye, at normal viewing distances, the  m9 24x30 inch prints appear to be in the same general resolution league as the  s2 and the p65+.
phaseone df/p65+, handheld.
the leica s lenses have practically immeasurable focus shift (they also have practically immeasurable vignetting).
the phaseone df with the p65+ back and 80 mm d lens delivers higher resolution than the leica s2 with the 70 mm lens.
in other words, the s2 can focus more accurately at a specific distance.
____________________________________________________________________________________ two things: – the lens hoods – the delay in the market introduction of most s2 lenses
i tried to make it fail and it never did.
the basic s2 body and 70 mm lens at $28,290.00 is approximately $13,700.00 less than the phaseone system i used for the test, and comes close to the prices of medium format 39 megapixel systems.
they are completely impractical in the  field.
it is difficult to recommend and  frustrating to try to use a system that only has one or two lenses available.
a typical example is as follows: suppose i want to focus on a tree at about 200-300 feet.
but there is much more: leica makes a huge effort through fine adjustments in the manufacturing process to make sure that the sensor in each camera is perfectly positioned within extremely tight tolerances.
the difference is  subtle, but it is noticeable in side-by-side print comparisons.
if you have ever shot a non-leaf  shutter 300 mm lens or longer with a high resolution medium format digital  camera, you have probably experienced enough vibration from the focal plane  shutter to affect the sharpness and resolution of the image.
the  general behavior of the different systems i compared for this article is  exactly as should be expected.
in terms of image quality, it eats them alive.
landscape and nature photographers also greatly value leaf shutter lenses  because of the reduction in vibration.
in terms of pricing, the s2 comes closer to medium format systems.
it has excellent ergonomics  and it is amazingly compact and quick in light of the image quality it  delivers.
i love surprises, and the real surprise here is how well the m9/noctilux combination holds up.
most of the lenses that were announced quite a while ago are not out yet, and the central shutter versions continue to be delayed.
in terms of size and weight, it is actually smaller and feels lighter than  the top of the line japanese dslr’s.
leica makes great lens hoods for the m-system and they used to make great lens hoods for the r system.
they are designed for maximum  performance wide open, and leica claims no change in performance when you close  the lens down (except for diffraction at small apertures).
the basic s2 body and 70 mm lens at $28,290.00 is approximately $13,700.00  less than the phaseone system i used for the test, and comes close to the  prices of medium format 39 megapixel systems.
manual focus using lenses in alpa mounts with a properly shimmed medium format back adapter is incredibly accurate.
i sincerely hope that these kinds of bad lens hoods never make it to the m-system!
they are completely impractical in the field.
ditto for the feel of the shutter release button and the greatly reduced amount of vibration of the focal plane shutter mechanism versus other slr’s.
the only  adjustment i made to the images was a white balance adjustment using an x-rite  passport.
once enough lenses become available, this could easily become the system of  choice for a number of serious photographers.
finally, just out of curiosity, i also took a few shots on the tripod and hand held with a leica m9 and the 50mm / f 0.95 noctilux (an extraordinary “normal” lens) at the same apertures as the equivalent mf shots.
at least in theory, it should surpass any other system currently  available.
so, i handed the  camera over to my 16 year old son, who had never used a leica m or a leica slr.
the leica autofocus sensor system is quite unique and truly state of the  art.
here is a camera that is actually smaller and feels lighter than a 35 mm  pro dslr, handles much better than any medium format camera, yet delivers image  quality competitive with the bigger, heavier and much more cumbersome top of  the line medium format systems.
photographers hate them.
(not to digress much, focusing accuracy is one of the reasons why i like alpa technical cameras so much.
june, 2010 ____________________________________________________________________________________ about mark dubovoy dr. dubovoy is highly regarded as a technical expert in many aspects of  printing technology and photography.
obviously, any photographer that uses strobes prefers leaf shutter lenses,  since they do away with the sync limitations of focal plane shutters.
the camera figures  out the lens, the focusing distance and aperture, and just before the exposure  it applies an algorithm that re-focuses the lens.
what happened here is a complete mystery to me.
(not to digress much, focusing accuracy is one of the reasons why i  like alpa technical cameras so much.
japanese style reversible lens hoods are an  abomination.
since my main interest is always maximum image quality, i spent most of my time comparing the s2 with my phaseone df/p65+ medium format system.
add to this a high resolution mf back like a p65+, and the tree is guaranteed to look out of focus.
first of all, it focuses faster than hasselblad, mamiya and phaseone cameras.
most of the mamiya, hasselblad (fuji), phaseone, nikon, canon, sony, etc.
in fact, i had zero questions about the operation of the s2.
this is an amazing  accomplishment, leica has done an admirable job with the contrast, accutance  and resolution of the m9 to give the eye the impression of such high resolution  at normal and even closer than normal viewing distances with relatively large  prints.
his photographs are included in a number of private collections, as well as the permanent collections of the museum of contemporary art in mexico city, the san francisco museum of modern art, the monterey art museum, the berkeley art museum and the museum of modern art in nanao japan.
____________________________________________________________________________________ methodology
finally, focus shift could make matters worse if it goes the wrong way.
if you have ever shot a non-leaf shutter 300 mm lens or longer with a high resolution medium format digital camera, you have probably experienced enough vibration from the focal plane shutter to affect the sharpness and resolution of the image.
instead, the world has gone the wrong way, and now leica is making japanese-style bad hoods.
i can detect a very slight advantage in favor of the p65+ in the deepest shadow detail in one of my prints, but i would say that from a practical point of view, there is no meaningful difference in dynamic range between the two systems.
i also made some hand-held exposures.
the camera figures out the lens, the focusing distance and aperture, and just before the exposure it applies an algorithm that re-focuses the lens.
obviously, any photographer that uses strobes prefers leaf shutter lenses, since they do away with the sync limitations of focal plane shutters.
once i realized that you push on the scroll wheel to select things (a brilliant  design that eliminates additional buttons), i felt i had a complete  understanding of everything the camera can do.
to the naked eye, at normal viewing distances, the m9 24x30 inch prints appear to be in the same general resolution league as the s2 and the p65+.
finally, better designed and properly aligned sensors, as well as superb lenses clearly show their contributions to image quality.
the s2 has many more focus zones, and the lenses  have essentially no focus shift.
hoods for the normal and long s2 lenses and rectangular fixed lens hoods with  rectangular lens caps for the wide angle s2 lenses.
____________________________________________________________________________________ what is there not to like about the s2? two things: – the lens hoods – the delay in the market introduction of most s2 lenses
finally, just  out of curiosity, i also took a few shots on the tripod and hand held with a  leica m9 and the 50mm / f 0.95 noctilux (an extraordinary “normal”  lens) at the same apertures as the equivalent mf shots.
all s2 lenses will be manufactured in two versions: a standard version that requires the use of the focal plane shutter in the camera and a “central shutter” (leica’s name for a leaf shutter type lens) version with the shutter built into the lens.
it exudes leica quality in every sense of the word.
the s2 represents a huge relief from the ever increasing number of buttons and dials, as well as the poorly designed (in my opinion) custom functions and menus in japanese dslr’s and medium format cameras.
most observers will not subject prints to such scrutiny.
the leica s2 body is priced at $22,995.00 us dollars in its regular version  (a special version with a sapphire screen and a platinum service contract costs  an extra $5,000.00 dollars).
he was shooting with the s2 using all modes in literally under 90 seconds with  no instruction from me, and without a user’s manual.
the leica s lenses have practically immeasurable focus shift (they also  have practically immeasurable vignetting).
after several days of shooting, i did not find one single image where the  s2 autofocus system failed.
i have  never experienced this with any other camera (35 mm size dslr’s included).
lens hoods are truly horrible).
so here is my take on autofocus systems: i basically do not trust the autofocus systems in medium format cameras.
so, i handed the camera over to my 16 year old son, who had never used a leica m or a leica slr.
if any readers expected to be able to pixel peep test images in this article, i am sorry to disappoint you.
this is a nice  size to show meaningful differences.
prints are the proper way.
they are without question some of the best lenses i have ever used if not outright the best lenses i have ever experienced.
periodically they fail for me, so i make it a habit to always fine tune with manual focus.
not so with the leica.
the main advantages of leaf shutter lenses are: – much higher sync speeds when using flash or strobes.
there are plenty of sites and magazines that describe each feature and perform all kinds of technical tests on cameras.
since my main interest is always maximum image quality, i spent most of my  time comparing the s2 with my phaseone df/p65+ medium format system.
most of the lenses that were announced quite a while ago are not out yet, and  the central shutter versions continue to be delayed.
both, phaseone and leica are now shipping a number of lenses with leaf shutters.
i continue to marvel at how m9 prints hold up much better than canon or nikon prints when you go big.
so, in terms of the laws of physics, there are no real surprises.
landscape and nature photographers also greatly value leaf shutter lenses because of the reduction in vibration.
as you will see below, the s2 image quality is squarely in high  quality medium format territory.
the phaseone images were processed using captureone 5.1; the leica images  were processed using lightroom 3.
long focal length lenses particularly benefit from this reduction in vibration.
the disadvantage of leaf shutter lenses is that they tend to be more expensive and slightly larger and heavier.
the problem is that the algorithm is based on one "ideal sample" lens.
there are plenty of sites and magazines that describe each feature and perform  all kinds of technical tests on cameras.
using autofocus  with a medium format camera, the system often goes into the infinity focusing  zone.
i obviously  played with all of them, but i believe the fairest comparison was using the  “normal” lenses on both cameras: the 70 mm on the s2 the 80 mm “d” lens on the phaseone the cameras were set side-by-side on large series 5 gitzo carbon fiber  tripods and i made exposures of many types of subjects under all kinds of  lighting conditions in normal mode as well as mirror up mode.
let me repeat myself:
this proved to be correct when i  used the s2 for two solid days without encountering a single glitch.
this is a problem, since autofocus systems focus with the lens wide open.
for a detailed technical description, i recommend the articles written about it inleica fotografie magazine.
i suppose this is the “leica m look”, but  for better accuracy i tend to tame them when i edit.
until these lenses are  available, the s2 system is likely to stay marginalized.
50 mm noctilux  lens, wide open at f/0.95 iso 640 ____________________________________________________________________________________ image quality
i think it is inexcusable for leica to have anything other than slide out hoods for the normal and long s2 lenses and rectangular fixed lens hoods with rectangular lens caps for the wide angle s2 lenses.
straight out of lightroom 3, without any  adjustments, the m9 images look a little too punchy, too contrasty and overly  saturated for my taste.
my hope was that the world would come to its senses, and after seeing the  leica hoods for many years, the japanese companies would finally start making  decent hoods.
resolution: the phaseone df with the p65+ back and 80 mm d lens delivers higher  resolution than the leica s2 with the 70 mm lens.
a few words about leaf shutter lenses are in order.
the leica s2 has many more  zones of focus from close up to infinity versus the competition.
in my images, the s2 lenses definitely exhibit absolutely superb performance in every respect, sharpness, contrast, color rendition, total lack of chromatic aberration, evenness of illumination from edge to edge and corner to corner, negligible geometric distortions, etc.
combined with leica’s unique autofocus  sensor system, autofocus on the s2 is deadly accurate.
the second item is self-explanatory.

the solidity and tight tolerances of the body and the lenses, as well as the quality of the image through the viewfinder are pure leica joy.
physically larger sensors (usually with more megapixels and bigger photo  sites) have an edge in resolution of fine details as well as better tonal  micro-dynamics and shadow detail.
