more expensive lenses such as the tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 and the very expensive canon 17-55mm f/2.8 is lens also produce excellent image quality and are more versatile in that they have a larger aperture and can produce better imagery wide open.virtually any dslr will, if matched with a good lens, be able to shoot excellent images.when it comes to the consumer range of dslrs, nikon's are more professional-able as well, both in build quality and number of functions.that said, a hotshoe flash such as the canon 430ex ii or 580ex ii (i use the older 550ex and 430ex which work just fine) used correctly will increase the versatility of any camera/lens combination, both for shooting indoors and for fill-light outdoors.however, even the very inexpensive kit lenses will produce very good to excellent image quality, especially if tripod mounted and shot around f/8 or f/11.very few actually own both brands, so comparative evaluation isn't usually possible, and those that do may not have comparable models.probably the most important parameter in image quality is the lens.for someone who has never handled/used a dslr before my advice would be to readup on what 'features' people use most, then go and play with a few cameras, in a decent camera shop.a flash and a decent tripod will go a long way in leveling the playing field between the least expensive kit lenses and the most expensive glass.the fact is that the manufacturers all know exactly what it is each others cameras can do and because they're competing with each other, these cameras tend to end up being very, very similar in what they do.i personally prefer nikon - they aren't better quality, they aren't better built, they aren't more reliable......you may also want to save some money for image processing software (although there is a lot of good free software available) and perhaps a tripod depending on what you are photographing.i personally prefer nikon - they aren't better quality, they aren't better built, they aren't more reliable......they aren't better anything to be honest i just prefer the overall design, handling and texture of their pro bodies.they're not the best quality but that is irrelevant - honestly it just doesn't matter what pixels you have, what iso you can use, what the lens cost, how many features your camera has, it all boils down to how good the person behind the lens is.if you start comparingsimilar models across brands, then what makes one model better than another will be different for different people; i like having a tilting lcd screen, but that doesn't mean cameras without that feature would be no good for you.
