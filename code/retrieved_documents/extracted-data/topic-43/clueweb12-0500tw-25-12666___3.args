- new af module capable of focusing at low light down to -2ev.
quiet shooting mode.
improved weather sealing and durable magnesium alloy construction.
the information presented here is not official canon information, but a very reliable leak a few hours before the actual announcement.
depth of field preview?) button close to the shutter release.
a few observations about the 5dm3′s design (based solely on the leaked pictures): canon has finally fixed the position of the on/off switch from near the back lower right of the lcd to the top of the camera, behind the main mode selector.
the ‘menu and info buttons have moved up from their previous positions to the left of the viewfinder.
a full-frame sensor (36mm x 24mm) has the same physical dimensions as 35mm film.
5 fps with battery grip, 6 fps in dx mode.
full hd 1080 movie, including raw hd output over hdmi.
most consumer dslrs have smaller sensors, called aps-c sensors (25mm x 16mm, which stands for advanced photo system type-classic).
the ‘eos 5d’ badge is more 7d like.
- 51 point autofocus with 15 cross-type sensors.
51 point autofocus with 15 cross-type sensors.
- 61 point autofocus, up to 41 cross type sensors.
apart from that, the top bank of buttons near the top lcd are the same.
this seems to be a dedicated video recording button.

100% viewfinder coverage.
this makes it much better in terms of quickly turning on the camera and shooting.
shutter durability of 200,000 cycles.
it’s specifications list is quite impressive: 36.3 megapixel full frame cmos sensor.
full-frame cameras, by virtue of their large sensors, have much better low-light performance, color rendition, dynamic range (the range of levels it can show between highlight and shadow) than their aps-c cousins.
last month, nikon came back roaring to release the d800.
it had great video shooting capabilities-
there is also an additional (probably picture control) button between the selector wheel and joystick at the back.

- full hd 1080 movie, including raw hd output over hdmi.
there is also an additional (probably picture control) button between the selector wheel and joystick at the back.
an additional button added to the front, at approximately 8 o’clock when the mount is viewed from the front.
- shutter durability of 200,000 cycles.
there is a new ‘rate’ button, second from top in the row of buttons on the left side of the lcd.
the d700 did have a superior autofocus (af) system, but that was really about it.
you also tend to get shallower depth of field for the same aperture on a full-frame than on an aps-c camera.
dual (cf and sd) card slots.
- the ‘menu and info buttons have moved up from their previous positions to the left of the viewfinder.
the differences are more for their handling and features over and above great iq.
this post is a quick comparison between the latest nikon and canon full-frame digital slrs.
- improved durability, water and dust resistance.

5 fps with battery grip, 6 fps in dx mode.
a 36 megapixel imaging monster, this camera delivers almost every conceivable video option and then some.

canon 5d mark iii not to be outdone, here comes canon’s 5d mark iii (as yet unreleased): what is inside is equally as impressive: - 22.3 megapixel full frame cmos sensor.
you also tend to get shallower depth of field for the same aperture on a full-frame than on an aps-c camera.

silent and low vibration shooting modes.

- improved metering which allows better scene recognition, including face detection.

something that its competitor- the nikon d700 completely lacked; a higher megapixel sensor, and was overall lighter than the d700.
