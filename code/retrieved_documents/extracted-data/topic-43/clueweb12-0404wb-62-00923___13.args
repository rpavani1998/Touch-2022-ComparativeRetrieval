but, a while ago, i used the old 10d which was on its last legs as a trade in for a 7d on the canon loyalty program.
therefore they can be used in lower light levels without flash.
look here and see that k5 is the highest rated 'non-monstrous' camera of all.
there are many lenses and the cost of these can soon add up.
i suspect that if all the slrs had the same mount such that you could use any lens on any camera easily, you might see more people swapping back and forth between brands.
a nice way to start is to pick the same brand as someone you know.
what suits me in the uk may not be so valid for you in canada or another member on the opposite side of our planet.
which camera brand do i find best?reply with quote the one that i have with me at the time i want to take a shot that will allow me to take the shot that i want to take.
i would often inadventently change the shooting mode.
if you do not know anyone with a dslr then you can ask here for advice.
also note that it is more important to get a good lens than a good camera.
n and c. and stick with what you decide otherwise swapping and buying new lenses will set you back a small fortune as they are rarely compatible.
i think no matter brand you end up with, you become comfortable using it and the way it works over time so it doesn't really matter.
another way of looking at it is this: there is no such thing as a bad camera, actually there is no such thing as a camera that isn't capable of fantastic photographs.
in 2006 i found only nikon and canon were developing cameras towards my needs anymore, and after pouring over the technology stats, optical quality of lens range, sample images etc.
but the truth is that if you are looking to but a new camera the best thing you can do is, first of all decide how much you can spend (and remember you've got to get memory cards, batteries, a lens (if that's not part of the package).
there are a few that change from one brand to another (usually because of a perceived difference), and they may have opinions (not necessarily more than opinion).
if you do high end fashion, it probably is, as you will have demanding clients, but if you are shooting for pleasure, or in low light, it would be dreadful investment.
so i can't see me using canon any time soon.
what is more important is to be happy with the equipment you choose.
if you were to count votes, all you will discover which brand is owned by most people.
my wife kerry then ended up with a nikon as well so we could shoot the same lenses.
i have the opportunity to play with and use just about every camera going on a daily basis.
there are not many brands i have not used over the years, but would hesitate to push anyone into a particular brand, because they all have their merits.
i once had a camera that i detested using for ergonomic reasons:, the canon xt or 350d. i did not like it for a very silly reason, the camera shooting mode was changed by pressing a button on the rear of the camera, to the right of the lcd.
disclaimer: the above is not a solicitation to buy a pentax, meant as a joke, and i can just as easily prove that you should not buy pentax, as that you should.

go into a camera store and ask to see them and be allowed to handle them.
for someone who has never handled/used a dslr before my advice would be to readup on what 'features' people use most, then go and play with a few cameras, in a decent camera shop.
hi kiki,reply with quote i can see why this is causing problems, due to the unique nature of the dslr/similar camera systems, once people start investing in lens, they are very unlikely to scrap that investment and change to another brand.
if you push, you'll get a lot more replies like glenn's pragmatic view; what anyone owns must betheir best because it is all they know.
does it mean canon are best; no, i don't believe it does, successful brands are more often determined by things such as effective marketing and support rather than the technical merit of the hardware - history is littered with such examples; vhs over betamax, etc. bear in mind also that availability of both hardware and especially support, varies widely from country to country.
a flash and a decent tripod will go a long way in leveling the playing field between the least expensive kit lenses and the most expensive glass.

my job is an interesting one and i love it.
one may just feel better to you.
some people shoot camera phones and get far better pics than i can take.
the lens will last much longer than a camera body.
when it comes to the consumer range of dslrs, nikon's are more professional-able as well, both in build quality and number of functions.
what is more important is to be happy with the equipment you choose.
most of my photo jobs are concerts and portraits, and in that range of lenses nikon has the best glass hands down (canon has nothing that can touch the nikon 14-24mm f2.8 g ed af-s, the 70-200mm f/2.8 vr ii or (back then) the 85mm f/1.8, now f/1.4)reply
they're not the best quality but that is irrelevant - honestly it just doesn't matter what pixels you have, what iso you can use, what the lens cost, how many features your camera has, it all boils down to how good the person behind the lens is.
go to a place, where you can see a lot of people with cameras.
kiki's already got a dslr - a nikon d3000 or 3100 i'm guessing from the size of the body in one of her self-portraits.
more expensive lenses such as the tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 and the very expensive canon 17-55mm f/2.8 is lens also produce excellent image quality and are more versatile in that they have a larger aperture and can produce better imagery wide open.
probably the most important parameter in image quality is the lens.
but the truth is that if you are looking to but a new camera the best thing you can do is, first of all decide how much you can spend (and remember you've got to get memory cards, batteries, a lens (if that's not part of the package).
pick a budget and you will find one or possibly two cameras that are 'better' within it.
i have experience (limited i agree in some cases) with every camera that exists within the members here and i have to answer question on them with some level of conviction every day.
however, probably best to play safe and stick with the big two.
try a few out for yourself, but only have part of an ear open when you ask for recommendations, as most folk will tell you their x or y brand is best.
if you do high end fashion, it probably is, as you will have demanding clients, but if you are shooting for pleasure, or in low light, it would be dreadful investment.
i would say that the differences between cameras are greater within the various grades of cameras within a brand than between two equivalent grades of nikon - canon.
having been shooting in a studio with a phase one kit today, (iq180, that costs more than your average exec car) you might say that this is best.
probably less 5% of members will have personal experience of more than one dslr brand.
another way of looking at it is this: there is no such thing as a bad camera, actually there is no such thing as a camera that isn't capable of fantastic photographs.
more expensive lenses such as the tamron 17-50mm f/2.8 and the very expensive canon 17-55mm f/2.8 is lens also produce excellent image quality and are more versatile in that they have a larger aperture and can produce better imagery wide open.
the once you have decided that, check out all the cameras that are available in that price range.
my problem was due to the small size of the camera and the large size of my hands combined with how i hold a camera; my right thumb automatically rested right at that button.
i love the control systems on all these cameras but, the 7d wins hands down for ease of controlling.
you may also want to save some money for image processing software (although there is a lot of good free software available) and perhaps a tripod depending on what you are photographing.
my job is an interesting one and i love it.
kiki you'll find that you've asked one of those questions for which there will never be a clear answer.
it is also a fluid question in that there are cameras coming to the market on a monthly business and it stands to reason that they will be 'better' that the ones they replace.
for me, i went down the nikon path because i had an old lens that i wanted to try and re-use from a film slr from many years ago.

i have owned nikon slrs, both back in film days and now digital, but i have also owned canon rangefinder and digi p&s cameras, but i still cannot say which is "best"; it is like comparing apples and oranges.

despite, some claims to the contrary, a bounced flash modified with a diffuser/reflector can produce very natural looking and pleasing light.
our transition from film to digital slrs saw us end up purchasing a few bridge cameras on the way - mainly a fuji finepix and a panasonic lumix - both capable cameras for what we were doing at the time (point and shoot).
i personally prefer nikon - they aren't better quality, they aren't better built, they aren't more reliable......
imo, most of the differences between dslr cameras are in the controls and ergonomics.

since i had no problems when i shot my larger canon 10d camera (which imo had a better control system), i gave the xt to my son-in-law (who has no problem because his hands are smaller than mine)
that said, a hotshoe flash such as the canon 430ex ii or 580ex ii (i use the older 550ex and 430ex which work just fine) used correctly will increase the versatility of any camera/lens combination, both for shooting indoors and for fill-light outdoors.

i love the control systems on all these cameras but, the 7d wins hands down for ease of controlling.
well, i've started out with olympus, then went to fujifilm in earlier digital photography days.
i personally prefer nikon - they aren't better quality, they aren't better built, they aren't more reliable......they aren't better anything to be honest i just prefer the overall design, handling and texture of their pro bodies.
then you can ask advice and, even better, borrow their equipment.

if you start comparingsimilar models across brands, then what makes one model better than another will be different for different people; i like having a tilting lcd screen, but that doesn't mean cameras without that feature would be no good for you.

very few actually own both brands, so comparative evaluation isn't usually possible, and those that do may not have comparable models.
the lens is what focusses the light.
with quote low light performance of the sensor is my most important niche, and nikon has always been hands down far and above canon in that aspect.
nikon, i cannot say it is better never having used a cannon.

virtually any dslr will, if matched with a good lens, be able to shoot excellent images.
