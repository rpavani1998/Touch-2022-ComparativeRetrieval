certain good equipment helps but excellent pictures can come from the cheapest of cameras, photography is much more about technique and patience both with yourself and your subjects.it also gives flexibility for framing as you can zoom in and out using the eyepiece as well as the camera, though i rarely use it above 20x as the more magnification you use the more light you need or to put it another way the lower you shutter speed will need to be for the correct exposure.of course digiscoping is possible with a dslr and these cameras certainly will capture and write raw files very quickly.above all the images are sharp when focused correctly and at iso50 (another feature not available on many other cameras) there is very little noise.digiscoping with a dslr is possible though my experience is that you need far more light than with the usual p&s style cameras, this can be overcome to an extent by using higher iso settings and noise levels at higher iso's are getting lower with every new camera.it is often necessary to tweak digiscoped images a little, brightening them up and using a little sharpening is normal.to reduce camera shake three things are a must, in many cases the cause of blurred images when digiscoping is the result of camera shake rather than poor focusing.in which situations you would use which set-up for wildlife and bird photography; digiscoping or dslr?digiscoping is a high power form of photography, which i think is best used in a casual manner.shades and magnifier held you to see the screen and are useful on sunny days and help accurately focus.its easier to use than many others and has a very useful flip out screen and a built in magnifier.depth of field (dof) is minimal with digiscoping, which makes focusing crucial, and the high magnifications involved mean that freezing the movement of both of the bird and setup in very important.this feature would be nice in a digiscoping camera and is available on only a few cameras that are digiscoping friendly.i produces sharp images to the point that if used correctly you can see detail in the feather barbs of the birds you are photographing.one of the best bird photographers of today to my mind is nigel blake his owl photography is just stunning and involves time, skill and a knowledge of your subject that he has perfected.how about using a dslr camera with a digiscoping?i do use both dslr and digiscoping for bird and wildlife photography though rarely together, there is only so much kit i can carry around at one time.
