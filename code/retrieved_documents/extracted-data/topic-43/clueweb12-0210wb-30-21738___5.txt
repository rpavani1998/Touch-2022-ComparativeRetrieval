as in the d300, the d300s has a top resolution of 4288 x 2848 pixels plus a base sensitivity range equivalent to iso 200 to iso 3200.
playing back recorded video clips via the camera is simple.
typical frame rates and clip lengths are shown in the table below.
two vr modes are provided: normal and active.
the d300s  can provide coverage for 16mm lenses with its built-in flash, which has a gn of  17 (metres/iso200).
200mm focal length, iso 200, 1/50 second at f/18.
af tuning is available for up to 12 lens types.
output and playback  options are essentially unchanged from the d300, as is the software bundle.
shutter speed range: 30 to 1/8000 seconds in steps of 1/3, 1/2 or 1 ev, bulb, x-synch at 1/250 sec.
as expected from our tests of the d300, resolution declined slightly as iso sensitivity was increased and remained relatively high at the hi 1.0 setting, which equates to iso 6400.
image quality: stills - 8.5; video - 7.0 overall: 8.5 depending on how you rate the addition of video  capture and dual card slots, nikon's d300s can be rated as either a major or  minor upgrade to the d300.
70mm focal length, iso 1600, 1/60 second at f/5.6.
not surprisingly, nef.raw files converted into 16-bit tiffs produced higher resolution than jpegs in our imatest tests.
tiff file capture is provided for photographers who require large files but don't want the hassle of shooting in raw format.
all internal processing in the chip is handled in full 16-bit colour, which provides better tonal reproduction, improved colour fidelity and faster image processing.
however, a new ‘q' setting on the release mode dial enables  photographers to reduce the sound of the camera's mirror-down during shooting.
auto white balance with fluorescent lighting.
swapping to raw file capture with lossless compression, we recorded 10 frames in 2.1 seconds with the 12-bit setting and 10 frames in 3.2 seconds with the 14-bit setting, which is about 5 fps and 3 fps respectively.
the new model  claims to be able to achieve up to seven frames/second with the supplied  lithium-ion battery and eight frames/second with the optional multi-power  battery pack mp-d10 or mains power.
set the camera to live view mode by pressing the lv button and choose  between the tripod and hand-held modes.
active d-lighting off.
we observed little or no effect on processing  times with any of the levels selected.
lens  coverage with the built-in flash is wider than the 18mm of the d300.
controls aside from functions associated with the new movie mode (see below), the control suite on the d300s has changed very little from the d300 and the menu structure is essentially unchanged.
rrp: $3,299 (body only) rating (out of 10): depending on how you rate the addition of video capture and dual card slots, nikon's d300s can be rated as either a major or minor upgrade to the d300.

dark-frame subtraction appears to be involved in this mode as image processing times are roughly doubled.
aperture settings need to be locked in before you begin shooting video clips, although the selected aperture will only be used if you're shooting in tripod mode.
it's a minor change -  but important for triggering movie start and stop.

the review camera was supplied with the new af-s dx nikkor 18-200mm  f/3.5-5.6 g ed  vr ii lens, an update to the af-s vr zoom-nikkor 18-200mm  f/3.5-5.6 g
no stuck pixels were observed, even in 30-second exposures.
shooting can't begin until the camera  has focused and the focus is locked at the start of the recording.
an  rgb bayer filter provides colour information.
35mm focal length, iso 200, 1/400 second at f/10.
file processing was completed in 11.8 seconds.
even without the active d-lighting function engaged, outdoor shots contained the wide dynamic range that's expected from a dslr camera.

in hand-held mode, recording will  stop if the shutter button is half-pressed or the af-on button is pressed.
auto iso control is also provided.
maximum and minimum apertures change as shown in the table below.
customised picture controls can also be saved to a memory card for sharing with other d300s cameras and compatible software.
most shooting modes can be used for recording video clips, although matrix metering is used for all movie clip recordings, regardless of which metering pattern is set.
once  recording begins, you can only focus manually.
movies can only be recorded in live view mode and the frame rate is fixed  at 24 frames/second.
it's necessary because this lens is very prone to zoom creep when pointed downwards.
exposure can be locked by pressing the ae-l/af-l  button or adjusted by up to ±3 ev in steps of 1/3 ev in p, s, and a  modes with the exposure compensation control.
the 51-point af system continues and, like its predecessor, the d300s is  designed for use with cpu lenses (particularly types g and d).
although the body dimensions of both models are the same, the d300s is  approximately 15 grams heavier than its predecessor.
the  sensor is the same dx-format 12.3 megapixel (effective) chip and both models  include nikon's latest expeed image processor which is the same as in the d90  (the first dslr to offer hd video recording).
use the arrow pad to select the clip you wish to play and press ok to start and stop the video playback.
ten 14-bit raw+jpeg files were captured in 3.3 seconds and this burst took 11.6 seconds to process.

if two memory cards are in use, you must also select which card to record to.
as in the d300, the d300s has a top resolution of 4288 x 2848 pixels plus a  base sensitivity range equivalent to iso 200 to iso 3200.
the  d300s offers four presets: standard, neutral, vivid and monochrome and two  additional presets -  portrait and landscape - can be downloaded from the  nikon website.
‘overflow' recording directs image data to the secondary card automatically when the primary card is full.
the 51-point af system continues and, like its predecessor, the d300s is designed for use with cpu lenses (particularly types g and d).
press the lv  button a second time to disengage live view then press the review button.
factors contributing to  the additional weight could be the second card slot (which adds support for sd  and sdhc media to the d300's cf card storage) plus any additional electronics  for video recording.
in hand-held mode, recording will stop if the shutter button is half-pressed or the af-on button is pressed.
however, at 200mm, darkened corners could be seen in test shots.
the d300s can provide coverage for 16mm lenses with its built-in flash, which has a gn of 17 (metres/iso200).
flash compensation of -3 to +1ev is provided, along with a flash exposure (fv) lock that works with add-on flash units.
(without an external microphone, audio recordings are monaural.)
- you want a live view system plus the ability to shoot hd video clips - and are prepared to accept the limitations in the movie mode.
auto white balance performance with the review camera was similar to the d300's, with residual colour casts remaining in shots taken under both incandescent and fluorescent lighting.
however, when subjects were stationary or very slow moving, images were sharp and detailed enough to provide satisfactory footage for display on a widescreen tv set.
being a relatively slow lens - with maximum apertures ranging from f/3.5 to f/5.6 - it is also relatively compact and measures 96.5mm in length at the 18mm setting with a diameter of roughly 77mm (without the lens hood attached).
it's located in the main interface compartment on the left side panel and supports stereo sound recording with any microphone that has a 3.5 mm diameter stereo mini-pin jack.
however, in actual tests shots we noticed an increasing deterioration in sharpness as noise increased at iso settings above 640, particularly in long exposures.
pressing the shutter release  takes a still picture (at the pre-set stills resolution) while the video is  being recorded.
the shutter mechanism is unchanged from the d300 and is rated for 150,000 cycles.

dark-frame  subtraction appears to be involved in this mode as image processing times are  roughly doubled.
tiff file capture is  provided for photographers who require large files but don't want the hassle of  shooting in raw format.
(ix-nikkor lenses cannot be used with this  camera.)
simultaneous raw+jpeg capture is offered at each of the three jpeg file  sizes supported.
the normal mode is for shooting from a stationary base, while the active mode is designed to provide compensation when shooting from a moving platform, such as a vehicle or ship.
two types of noise reduction processing are provided, separately covering long exposures and high iso settings.
