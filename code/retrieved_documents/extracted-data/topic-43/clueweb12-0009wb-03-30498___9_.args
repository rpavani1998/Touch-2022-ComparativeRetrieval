some viewers thought my photographs were intrusive, that i had exploited vulnerable people at a desperately unhappy time in their lives.yet my only concern was that photography students use their cameras to engage their world with passion and commitment—for me, photography was a primarily a method for exploring ideas and emotions.for many parents, i had created a record of their child’s struggle towards recovery and their responses to that struggle; for a lonely few, my photographs are the only tangible evidence of their baby’s brief existence.given that documentary photographs are never transparently truthful, but invariably constructed, i admire pictures that acknowledge the fundamental dishonesty that lies at their core, even as they pretend to depict “reality.”rather, i saw the postmodernist position not as a personal affront but as rigid, unimaginative, and inappropriate for young students with a relatively constrained view of what could be possible in life and in art.i don’t know whether the system was particularly slack in those days but when i commenced the ma the emphasis was firmly on art practice: my obligations were to make photographs, write regular progress reports, meet occasionally with a supervisor, and present the finished work in a gallery where it would be judged by independent assessors.she was excited by the new opportunities presented by photoflash bulbs, which made possible clear and highly detailed pictures under circumstances that would otherwise have been difficult or impossible for photography.their moralism strikes me as being at odds with their obsession with intradepartmental power plays and their rapt attention to new fashions in criticism and whatever will advance their careers.the use of two or three bulbs, synchronized to flash together as the shutter was released, could produce a reasonable simulation of normal interior light.as i’ve writtenin another post: some viewers thought my photographs were intrusive, that i had exploited vulnerable people at a desperately unhappy time in their lives.in doing so, i learned that my only loyalty was to the individuals i’d photographed and the images that resulted from our collaboration.every day i saw ordinary people, faced with appalling misfortune, behave with the most extraordinary courage and dignity.if i’d listened to her unbiased advice, if i’d been able to put aside my pathological distaste for art theory, if i’d been really open to experience… i could have created a work of far greater depth and complexity.i knew instinctively that my project would be anathema, that her enervated theorizing applied to the raw emotion of my pictures could only harm me and the work.i never photographed without permission and was acutely sensitive to every agonizing nuance.
