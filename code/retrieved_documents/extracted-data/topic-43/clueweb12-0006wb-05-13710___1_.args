the chrome finish should be quite bulletproof which will allow you to use the camera without being obsessed with not letting it touch anything.the black paint finish was invented for fondlers and is awfully impractical for a user.i wonder why leica don't produce a pre-brassed finish which would please the users and delight the fondlers (they could lie to the very few who aren't bored that it saw service in iraq).the idea that it is for 'fondlers' only comes from people who worry about resale value, and can't imagine a camera that shows any signs of use.it will be scratched and flaked to hell very quickly if you really use the camera, just like the voigtlander cosina painted brass lenses.the black paint on the mp is much tougher than the old paint used on m3 and m2 cameras.i have used an m6 for about 5- 7 years before i sold it and bought d60 and a few canon lenses.i like black cameras in general because they are less visible and more discreet, but if i were you i would pass on the black paint mp.but from reading some previous posts (yes, i have done the search) it seems that a black mp can be much worse.but i have also heard (correct me if this is not true) that chrome finish can "bubble" after a few years of use.a community of photographers search all of photo.net photo captions photo tags equipment store community > forums > leica and rangefinders > leica m bodies (inc.now i miss the m feeling so much(and believe it or not, i produce more "snapshots" with the d60 and imho less artistic photos than with an m).after a few years of use my m6 had scratches at the bottom and black colour peeled off around the corners.but the chrome is a more durable finish without doubt.anyway, i like both black and chrome and can't make up my mind.
