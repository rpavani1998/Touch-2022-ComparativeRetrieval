once enough lenses become available, this could easily become the system of choice for a number of serious photographers.it has excellent ergonomics and it is amazingly compact and quick in light of the image quality it delivers.in my images, the s2 lenses definitely exhibit absolutely superb performance in every respect, sharpness, contrast, color rendition, total lack of chromatic aberration, evenness of illumination from edge to edge and corner to corner, negligible geometric distortions, etc.this is an amazing accomplishment, leica has done an admirable job with the contrast, accutance and resolution of the m9 to give the eye the impression of such high resolution at normal and even closer than normal viewing distances with relatively large prints.the leica feels good in the hand, is kind to the eye, and all the functions, features and controls are presented in perfectly logical fashion, exactly where one expects them to be.the leica autofocus sensor system is quite unique and truly state of the art.physically larger sensors (usually with more megapixels and bigger photo sites) have an edge in resolution of fine details as well as better tonal micro-dynamics and shadow detail.landscape and nature photographers also greatly value leaf shutter lenses because of the reduction in vibration.finally, better designed and properly aligned sensors, as well as superb lenses clearly show their contributions to image quality.long focal length lenses particularly benefit from this reduction in vibration.here is a camera that is actually smaller and feels lighter than a 35 mm pro dslr, handles much better than any medium format camera, yet delivers image quality competitive with the bigger, heavier and much more cumbersome top of the line medium format systems.like all leica products, it is expensive, but not out of line compared to medium format cameras.combined with leicaâ€™s unique autofocus sensor system, autofocus on the s2 is deadly accurate.the solidity and tight tolerances of the body and the lenses, as well as the quality of the image through the viewfinder are pure leica joy.the leica s lenses have practically immeasurable focus shift (they also have practically immeasurable vignetting).
