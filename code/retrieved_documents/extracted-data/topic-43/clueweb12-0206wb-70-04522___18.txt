the darkness of the sky should cause your camera to keep the  shutter open for a time-exposure, and you can end up with a splendid picture.
and hand-holding is the road to disaster – no one likes blurry fireworks photos.
composition is based on everything you already know about landscape photography as much as it is on your headlamp.
extension cables are suitable for such situations.
this means their maximum exposure time is likely to be shorter than  that for film cameras.
for brighter scenes you can put the flash off and increase iso.
will you be pleased with the overexposed lamp due to the long exposure needed in night conditions?
the white balance in case of such  photographs is better set to “auto” since the colors from the  lights differ from the environmental light and other lights coming from nearby.
a solid understanding of its features and controls can really unleash its potential.
in my example (with canon powershot a520), the dark photo was made with: aperture f 3.2, exposure time 0.100 sec; and the light one with: aperture f 3.2, exposure time 0.400 sec.
there are several reasons why they have not been totally  replaced by the use of flashguns – they have a higher light output than  many strobes.

the answer is that when you are further away from the camera, you have  more chances to remain unnoticed by the photographed subject – speaking  of wildlife photography.
exposure +3,+4, +5 (depending on how illuminated the scene was) – if your camera supports bracketing, do so – it’s very hard to get the right exposure from the first shot 4.
as for composition, you can make landscapes, covering the entire cave, you can focus on details – certain interesting formations, or, you can have a person standing there, adding the human factor to the natural environment of the cave.
a dramatic effect can be created by strongly backlighting a subject (along  with a properly lit foreground) such that the backlight creates a slightly  burned edge to offset it from the darker background.
by this time, you’re probably miles away from the cave with no intention of returning to it anytime soon.
step 5: your final image can be processed on the computer in order to obtain more fireworks in one single picture: a merging process of more shots with no blending.
focusing can be  similarly difficult.

“we written a special article just to address those issues.”
trying to photograph large formations, especially when they are beyond the limits of your headlamp, can be nearly impossible.
a dramatic effect can be created by strongly backlighting a subject (along with a properly lit foreground) such that the backlight creates a slightly burned edge to offset it from the darker background.
the units differ simply in the length of the cable and the type of connecter plug used to attach the cable to the camera.
but what if your subject is too far away (like far buildings) and you canâ€™t or just donâ€™t want to try a different angle with the sun behind you?
by this time, you’re probably miles away from  the cave with no intention of returning to it anytime soon.

this means their maximum exposure time is likely to be shorter than that for film cameras.

picture was taken in “program” mode.
the camera settings i used are: 1.
this is very useful when the camera is fixed to a tripod or supported on a wall.
important tip for long exposures:
the white balance in case of such photographs is better set to “auto” since the colors from the lights differ from the environmental light and other lights coming from nearby.
the other way around, if you choose the right exposure for the background (the usual auto or program mode will do that), then your subject will appear too dark (underexposed).
in a photoshop document, place the 2 frames as different layers in such way that the darker one will be under the lighter one.
some places allow a nice effect of the fireworks reflections on the water.
two exceptions are noticeable: the pictures depicting intense city traffic and the night roads when a car leaves behind a rail of light.
enjoy the music also!
get creative by framing your fireworks with the surrounding buildings or capturing the city lights below the fireworks.
if you don’t have a tripod, try bracing your  camera against some solid structure – for example, a wall, a post, or a  railing.
to close the camera shutter, simply  slide the remote switch button back and let go.
(it’s best to have your own lamp with you, however, in my case, the cave was illuminated for tourists since many years).
choose the eraser with a size bigger than the lamp (or whatever your overexposed object is), low hardness and low opacity as shown in the figure.
therefor,  i’ll start with pointing out the advantages of a remote control and then  i’ll give you a list of remote controls to choose from according to your  camera.
they also give off a wider arc of light than a strobe.
this means that it not possible to use a tc-80n3 with any of the e3-compatible cameras, such as the eos 350d or 400d. nikon mc30 and mc-36 remotes (designed for use with nikon slr cameras equipped with a 10-pin remote terminal) are compatible with nikon d300, d200, d100 (with mb-d100 grip attached), d3, d2h, d2hs, d2x, d1, d1h, d1x, f100, f6, f5, f90x and f90.
but, to be more specific, a good photograph does not have a person “standing” in the picture, but actually “doing” something: climbing or other action inside the cave.
as for the  connectors, take a look at e3 and n3 in the firts place, but note that there is  no adaptor that allows you to use a n3 remote switch with an e3-compatible  camera.

the units differ simply in the length of  the cable and the type of connecter plug used to attach the cable to the camera.
this dvd offers valuable instruction to anyone interested in digital slr photography, particularly those who have some familiarity with a digital slr’s basic functions.
itâ€™s much recommended to have a tripod and take the pictures using it because of 2 reasons: a brighter picture may require a longer exposure time (if you donâ€™t want to deal with a lot of noise you will prefer a longer time instead of higher iso and aperture) so you need to avoid camera shake (no matter how steady your hands are, night condition will always require a tripod), and the second reason: the frames should be taken from the same angle and viewpoint.
one of the question you might have is  “why are some cables longer than others?
some new cameras (hp photosmart r727, r827, r927, nikon d80, nikon coolpix s50 and s50c, s200, s500, p5000, the nikon l series, ) come with a function called d-lighting (or adaptive lighting).
answer: digital cameras need power when the shutter is open to keep the cmos sensor  active.
what about using a single-use “cardboard” disposable camera?
one of the question you might have is “why are some cables longer than others?
on most of the  photos, on post-processing, i added a warm filter to make the tree have a  yellowish green, and to make the red color stronger.
if you are interested in shooting star trails, you will reduce the noise levels in the images by shooting on cold winter nights rather than warm summer evenings.
but what if your camera does not have this function?
this will softly erase the area around the lamp in the lighter frame revealing the darker frame behind in such way that the 2 images will come together graduated, not suddenly.

step 3: adjust your camera settings like this: - continuous mode active with the maximum number of shots and about 1s delay between - some cameras have a preset â€œfireworks modeâ€ that automatically adjusts shutter speed and aperture (like most of the canon models), but if your camera doesnâ€™t have it, hereâ€™s a hint: shutter speed: 2 , aperture: 8.0 - if you done the first step, donâ€™t worry to much about the iso so let it as low as possible for low noise; also donâ€™t set the flash on - if the camera has a sharpening adjustment control, set it to very sharp step 4: when actually pressing the shutter button, wait for the burst to explode, but, until that moment, keep the button half-pressed (focused ready).
