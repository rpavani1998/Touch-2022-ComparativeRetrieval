notice that in most of the cases the road should be free of cars and walkers.
this means that it not possible to use a tc-80n3 with any of the e3-compatible cameras, such as the eos 350d or 400d. for nikon users: nikon mc30 and mc-36 remotes (designed for use with nikon slr cameras equipped with a 10-pin remote terminal) are compatible with nikon d300, d200, d100 (with mb-d100 grip attached), d3, d2h, d2hs, d2x, d1, d1h, d1x, f100, f6, f5, f90x and f90.

the darkness of the sky should cause your camera to keep the shutter open for a time-exposure, and you can end up with a splendid picture.
and hand-holding is the road to disaster – no one likes blurry fireworks photos.
composition is based on everything you already know about landscape photography as much as it is on your headlamp.
extension cables are suitable for such situations.
this means their maximum exposure time is likely to be shorter than that for film cameras.
for brighter scenes you can put the flash off and increase iso.
the white balance in case of such photographs is better set to “auto” since the colors from the lights differ from the environmental light and other lights coming from nearby.
a solid understanding of its features and controls can really unleash its potential.
in my example (with canon powershot a520), the dark photo was made with: aperture f 3.2, exposure time 0.100 sec; and the light one with: aperture f 3.2, exposure time 0.400 sec.
there are several reasons why they have not been totally replaced by the use of flashguns – they have a higher light output than many strobes.
but, i do believe that lighting is the most effective tool of a great cave picture (and, after all, you are providing all the lighting for the image), so i’m going to point out some tips fromephotozine: cave photographers mostly use flashguns as their primary light, followed by bulbs as their second main source.
all you need is this training dvd and about 93 minutes, and youâ€™ll have the knowledge and the confidence to create the images you want.
the answer is that when you are further away from the camera, you have more chances to remain unnoticed by the photographed subject – speaking of wildlife photography.
exposure +3,+4, +5 (depending on how illuminated the scene was) – if your camera supports bracketing, do so – it’s very hard to get the right exposure from the first shot 4.
as for composition, you can make landscapes, covering the entire cave, you can focus on details – certain interesting formations, or, you can have a person standing there, adding the human factor to the natural environment of the cave.
a dramatic effect can be created by strongly backlighting a subject (along with a properly lit foreground) such that the backlight creates a slightly burned edge to offset it from the darker background.
by this time, you’re probably miles away from the cave with no intention of returning to it anytime soon.
step 5: your final image can be processed on the computer in order to obtain more fireworks in one single picture: a merging process of more shots with no blending.
focusing can be similarly difficult.
iso 1600 (slower speeds limit your capability with the light sources you carry, faster speeds give you more of a problem with contrast and graininess) 3.
they are quite amazing and useful.
so be prepared to “ooh” and “ah” along with the crowd.
for the first christmas tree picture, my friend tudor used flash (with -2 exposure) in rear mode, in low light.
(it’s best to have your own lamp with you, however, in my case, the cave was illuminated for tourists since many years).
once you learn how the cameraâ€™s components work together, youâ€™ll have all the tools you need to capture the best image under all conditions.
in close-up shots, the use of a softened light (soft box or even just a piece of tissue over the flash tube) is frequently better than a hard light.

if you are interested in shooting star trails, you will reduce the noise levels in the images by shooting on cold winter nights rather than warm summer evenings.
shutter speed mode: around 1/30sec (longer exposure time will likely cause motion blur and overexposed areas near the lighting source) 2.
unfortunately, at the time i shot the images in this example, i did not have a tripod so the bright image is blured due to camera shake, but i somehow managed to take quite similar frames.

how to shoot great pictures of caves – a guide to cave photography during these summer months, i’ve been traveling to various caves in romania.
change the eraser option like this:smaller size to fit only the interior of the lamp, full 100% opacity and 100% hardness.
for brighter scenes you can put the flash off and increase iso.
many point-and-shoot cameras have a special fireworks setting, but if the camera you are using doesn’t, try to “fool” the camera into keeping the shutter open.
nikon digital slr camera, this 45 minute nikon school© dvd is the perfect guide.
for the first christmas tree picture, my friend tudor used flash (with -2 exposure) in rear mode, in low light.
picture was taken in “shutter mode”.
a wireless controller has a transmitter and a receiver.
bob continues removing the mystery of overcoming photographic challenges in a variety of environments including the difficulties encountered with twilight portraits and landscapes.
if you are close enough to your subject, like for instance in portrait photography,using the flash even if it is a very sunny day will fix the problem in a very simple and effective way.
the second christmas tree picture has +3 exposure, no flash, and low light environment.
these cameras usually have a fixed shutter speed, and you can’t “fool” them into doing the right thing no matter what you do.
to explain better, my nikon d40x, like many other cameras, can not make an exposure longer than 30 seconds without a remote – at least that’s what the manual says.
while on a variety of locations, bob will share his vast knowledge of photography and nikon digital slrs to educate you on: · camera settings for best quality in various situations · lens choice for creative and practical shooting · utilizing the retouch menu for in-camera editing · exposure fundamentals and shooting options during the day’s shooting, bob takes us to familiar situations around the home and demonstrates a variety of creative photographic opportunities.
after all, the multitude of colorful lights is what makes christmas beautiful.
this function will solve the problem automatically.
this step will merge the 2 images and now, if you are still not satisfied with this result, you can play around withblur tool and healing brush before saving the final image.
in close-up shots, the use of a softened light (soft box or even just a piece of tissue over the flash tube) is frequently better than a hard light.
the topics are arranged in chapters, so you can move at your own pace, and return later to individual subjects.
(this is called double exposure technique) some in-deep readings i recommend: digital photography school fireworks tips very creative images to illustrate photojojo fireworks photography tips an advanced reading fireworks picture gallery tags: fireworks photography, 4th july, independence day, photographing fireworks, fireworks, fireworks pictures shooting against the light has always been a tricky thing in photography: if you choose to set a longer exposure or just to increase the exposure compensation in order to have plenty of light over the near subject, the background will appear burned (overexposed).
it duplicates the action of the shutter button âˆ’ half pressure activates the exposure metering and focus while full pressure fires the shutter.
and hand-holding is the road to disaster – no one likes blurry fireworks photos.
the biggest problem is that you are working in near total darkness.
if you don’t have a tripod, try bracing your camera against some solid structure – for example, a wall, a post, or a railing.
slaves are remote electronic switches that you attach to each of the different flash units distributed around your cave photo area.
with a remote release, once you have pressed the button you can lock it down by sliding the button forward.
if you are interested in digital cameras with d-light function check them on amazon.
using the flash is not necessary if you want to create a mystery scene in which all is black but the lamp illuminated formation.
on most of the photos, on post-processing, i added a warm filter to make the tree have a yellowish green, and to make the red color stronger.
the flash on your camera sends out the message to all the slaves to fire when your camera shutter opens.
shutter speed mode: around 1/30sec (longer exposure time will likely cause motion blur and overexposed areas near the lighting source) 2.

you can adjust the gradient by moving onto the dark image layer, in the menu â€œ imageâ€ -> â€œadjustments â€ select selective color.
if you have an slr camera, this should be no problem.
however, sometimes, when symmetry allows, you can start and end your road line in the middle of the picture.
for the shots, remember to have a tripod and a remote controller.
in most of the cases it will appear larger in the starting corner and thinner at the end.
the receiver is connected to the remote plug on the camera, and an extension cable can be attached if you need to be even further away.

using the flash is not necessary if you want to create a mystery scene in which all is black but the lamp illuminated formation.
as for the composition, it’s always a good idea to start the road from a corner of the picture up to the middle or the other corner .
sometimes the cave passage itself, if it is reflective, can serve as a bit of soft box on its own.
here’s how: when you see a rocket shoot skyward, press the shutter-button.
second, and equally important, since you are taking a time-exposure, your camera should be on a solid, unmoving base throughout the exposure.
play around with the â€œneutrals â€ until you are satisfied with the color gradient around the lamp.
a remote switch will allow you to fire your camera without the need to touch it.
along the way, bob will offer valuable insights on choices you can make to begin composing and shooting breathtaking photographs.
when shooting, make several frames with different exposures.
when photographing a large room, nothing beats the output of a flashbulb.
this also helps to eliminate the need for tripod.
for example, across the bottom of your frame you might show silhouettes of the crowd, or a statue (george washington on horseback?), or the skyline of thecity.
it eliminates the movement that can be transmitted to the camera as the shutter button is pressed.

they’re not as good as a tripod, but they’re better than hand-holding your camera.
trying to photograph large formations, especially when they are beyond the limits of your headlamp, can be nearly impossible.
a dramatic effect can be created by strongly backlighting a subject (along with a properly lit foreground) such that the backlight creates a slightly burned edge to offset it from the darker background.
the units differ simply in the length of the cable and the type of connecter plug used to attach the cable to the camera.
by this time, you’re probably miles away from the cave with no intention of returning to it anytime soon.
as for composition, you can make landscapes, covering the entire cave, you can focus on details – certain interesting formations, or, you can have a person standing there, adding the human factor to the natural environment of the cave.
this means their maximum exposure time is likely to be shorter than that for film cameras.
as for the connectors, take a look at e3 and n3 in the firts place, but note that there is no adaptor that allows you to use a n3 remote switch with an e3-compatible camera.
as a last word, i remember you to do not touch or walk on formations or clean areas that are off trail – protect the nature or else you will only picture the past and not the eternity.
this one trick will do more to make your fireworks pictures stand out than any other single thing you can do.

when all this is done, go to the menu â€œlayer â€ and select â€œmerge visibleâ€ (or press shift + ctrl+e).
lighting placement may seem easy at first until you get your processed images back and discover the glaringly over or underexposed portions of the photograph.
there are several reasons why they have not been totally replaced by the use of flashguns – they have a higher light output than many strobes.
once you erase the red marked area, you will notice that even if the pictures come together softly, the colors are not the same.
third, to add an extra-special touch to your picture, try to include something on the ground to give a sense of location to the firework display in the sky.

we give you a structure for looking at the controls as well as a repeatable ritual for taking great photos with your new camera.
with a remote release, once you have pressed the button you can lock it down by sliding the button forward.
as i said many times before, following the weather helps a lot: fog or rain give special effects, and, in the case of train rails, sunrise is also creating a mystical atmosphere.
so war i’ve been talking about the traditional way of remote picturing, but, the’s a new and more effective way these days: a wireless controller not only acts like your television remote controller, but it also works in the same way âˆ’ by infrared.
every photographer, from amateur to professional, will take pictures of christmas decorations because these are beautiful, eye catching, and most of all, memorable.

picture was taken in “program” mode.
this is very useful when the camera is fixed to a tripod or supported on a wall.
the white balance in case of such photographs is better set to “auto” since the colors from the lights differ from the environmental light and other lights coming from nearby.
the other way around, if you choose the right exposure for the background (the usual auto or program mode will do that), then your subject will appear too dark (underexposed).
in a photoshop document, place the 2 frames as different layers in such way that the darker one will be under the lighter one.
some places allow a nice effect of the fireworks reflections on the water.
two exceptions are noticeable: the pictures depicting intense city traffic and the night roads when a car leaves behind a rail of light.
get creative by framing your fireworks with the surrounding buildings or capturing the city lights below the fireworks.
if you don’t have a tripod, try bracing your camera against some solid structure – for example, a wall, a post, or a railing.
to close the camera shutter, simply slide the remote switch button back and let go.
(it’s best to have your own lamp with you, however, in my case, the cave was illuminated for tourists since many years).
choose the eraser with a size bigger than the lamp (or whatever your overexposed object is), low hardness and low opacity as shown in the figure.
they also give off a wider arc of light than a strobe.
this means that it not possible to use a tc-80n3 with any of the e3-compatible cameras, such as the eos 350d or 400d. nikon mc30 and mc-36 remotes (designed for use with nikon slr cameras equipped with a 10-pin remote terminal) are compatible with nikon d300, d200, d100 (with mb-d100 grip attached), d3, d2h, d2hs, d2x, d1, d1h, d1x, f100, f6, f5, f90x and f90.
but, to be more specific, a good photograph does not have a person “standing” in the picture, but actually “doing” something: climbing or other action inside the cave.
as for the connectors, take a look at e3 and n3 in the firts place, but note that there is no adaptor that allows you to use a n3 remote switch with an e3-compatible camera.
flash on: rear mode (this is what creates a different light color in the pictures – the blue one, for near objects) 5.
for those unfamiliar with basic digital slr operation, i recommend beginning with the nikon school© dvd, fast, fun& easy: great digital pictures.
first, i will show you the pictures i took with nikon d40x, 18mm lens,
they’re not as good as a tripod, but they’re better than hand-holding your camera.
the receiver is connected to the remote plug on the camera, and an extension cable can be attached if you need to be even further away.
it also features an exposure count setting.
so be prepared to “ooh” and “ah” along with the crowd.

this dvd offers valuable instruction to anyone interested in digital slr photography, particularly those who have some familiarity with a digital slr’s basic functions.
itâ€™s much recommended to have a tripod and take the pictures using it because of 2 reasons: a brighter picture may require a longer exposure time (if you donâ€™t want to deal with a lot of noise you will prefer a longer time instead of higher iso and aperture) so you need to avoid camera shake (no matter how steady your hands are, night condition will always require a tripod), and the second reason: the frames should be taken from the same angle and viewpoint.
answer: digital cameras need power when the shutter is open to keep the cmos sensor active.
on most of the photos, on post-processing, i added a warm filter to make the tree have a yellowish green, and to make the red color stronger.
if you are interested in shooting star trails, you will reduce the noise levels in the images by shooting on cold winter nights rather than warm summer evenings.
this will softly erase the area around the lamp in the lighter frame revealing the darker frame behind in such way that the 2 images will come together graduated, not suddenly.

the salvation in this case is aphotoshop manipulation.
once you learn how the cameraâ€™s components work together, youâ€™ll have all the tools you need to capture the best image under all conditions.
step 3: adjust your camera settings like this: - continuous mode active with the maximum number of shots and about 1s delay between - some cameras have a preset â€œfireworks modeâ€ that automatically adjusts shutter speed and aperture (like most of the canon models), but if your camera doesnâ€™t have it, hereâ€™s a hint: shutter speed: 2 , aperture: 8.0 - if you done the first step, donâ€™t worry to much about the iso so let it as low as possible for low noise; also donâ€™t set the flash on - if the camera has a sharpening adjustment control, set it to very sharp step 4: when actually pressing the shutter button, wait for the burst to explode, but, until that moment, keep the button half-pressed (focused ready).
the answer is that when you are further away from the camera, you have more chances to remain unnoticed by the photographed subject – speaking of wildlife photography.
now the shutter will stay open without you having to keep pressure on the button.

a cable release can also be helpful if you can get that attached to the camera.
second, and equally important, since you are taking a time-exposure, your camera should be on a solid, unmoving base throughout the exposure.
step 2: try finding a high place for observing and shooting the sky show, with no unwanted obstacles.
