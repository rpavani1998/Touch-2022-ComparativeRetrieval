all your comparisons definitely show the 3 cameras are better at different things and that one camera is not completely perfect.
the camera gives great expansion potential thanks to the flash hot-shoe, and rear accessory port.
handling hopefully the specifications and features of each camera has given you an idea of what each of these cameras offers, but it all becomes quite mute if the cameras are unable to offer the speed and image quality to back it up.
but all 3 cameras are winners and i wouldn't mind owning any of them.
i have the older canon s90 (and the older lumix lx3) and found the content valuable in making my decision to skip this particular generation of newer models and wait for the next.
i own sony a700 & a55 dslrs and previously owned the canon s90, so a lot to live up to in the image quality stakes.
i have bought pre-cut leathers from this company to cover my old film cameras and they are excellent to deal with.

detail is very good on the p300 shot, although it is possible to see sharpening artefacts.
an added bonus is the 1080p video is great quality too.
if canon could improve on these downsides with the next model (s100?), and perhaps add a flash hot-shoe, then canon would be onto a winner.
video performance: the lx5 has the most control over video, but also offers only monochrome sound, while the s95 and p300 both feature stereo sound.

iso100 here you can see the difference between having a 24mm equivalent lens and a 28mm equivalent lens, with the s95 in the middle showing less of the scene than the others.
iso100 the p300 and s95 zoomed in has very similar telephoto reach, with the s95 zooming the furthest to an equivalent of 105mm.
the three cameras provide a wide range of features, and go to show that the digital camera market is alive and well, with interesting, innovative, and competitive products, with each model differencing itself enough to make each camera worthy of your attention depending on your needs.
the s95 shows the softest results in these tests, as though the noise reduction settings are set too high.
we decided to compare three of the most compact serious cameras to find out how they perform, and what they offer that makes them worth parting with your cold hard cash for.
regarding the grip problem on the canon s90 and s95, camera leathers in the usa have cut panels in a very thin self-adhesive material to cover the s90 and are working on the same for the s95.
these panels are black and textured to give a better grip.
switching to the portrait scene mode produces softer skin, and removes red-eye from the subject (an example is shown in the full review).
portrait shots with flash nikon coolpix p300 canon powershot s95 panasonic lumix lx5 portrait with flash portrait with flash portrait with flash the s95 flash seemed to overexpose the image slightly, this was made worse by the screen on the back showing the image as brighter than it actually was, and the shot also shows the worst red-eye of the three cameras.
2fps (~) each camera excels at something, most noticeably the p300 with the fastest start up time, and fastest continuous shooting (by a long shot).
only this camera currently gives this as the lx5 is much larger and the canon s95 only goes to 28mm.
the p300 produces an image that has a slightly yellow tone to it, however colour is very good.

i don't know why you would need an extra flash for this camera and i really hope canon doesn't put one on the s100.
the build quality is exceptional.
further to this is features a well laid out menu system with an abundance of options, including numerous video options, and comes with a leather neck strap.
unfortunately the camera lacks raw support, which could put some people off this camera, as you will have to trust the jpeg results straight from the camera.
the nikon coolpix p300 features a normal sized 12 megapixel back lit cmos sensor that you would find in many other compact cameras (such as thenikon coolpix s9100), an f/1.8 - 4.9 wide angle lens starting at 24mm equivalent, and a high resolution 3 inch screen with 920k pixels.
also camera menu allows custom color settings for increasing sharpness and saturation giving a little better image quality.
the p300 and lx5 both feature dedicated video record buttons and let you use the optical zoom while recording, while the s95 only has digital zoom while recording.
to test this we took 6 or more shots and calculated the average, so that consistent results were produced, we also made sure to test all the cameras at the same time to ensure the cameras were being tested under the same conditions.
the s95 is not necessarily slow, however, in this competition it is noticeable that it scores as the slowest camera of the three, apart from shutter response which seemed the quickest (just).
the p300 offered the softest results, with the stronger contrast causing detail to be lost in the shadow areas of images.
we tested each camera's performance at focusing, shutter response, shot to shot time, continuous shooting etc, and have posted the results below.
the canon offers a clever dial around the lens, raw support and customisable buttons.
i suppose as with many compacts there may be some artifacts magnified very closely but this would be like trying to make 6ft x 4ft posters from it, in other words in the real world the images look superb.
nikon coolpix p300 winner at... high speed shooting and video... very good image quality with bright saturated images, also the second smallest camera, but importantly offers hand grip at the front and back (unlike the s95), and offers the lowest price.

the lx5 is to be commended for excellent focusing speed, and general all round quick performance, whilst not as quick as the p300, the 2.5fps continuous shooting is still adequate, and the rest of the performance figures are good.

it also allows a few more tweaks like choosing super fine jpeg images.
this is followed by the p300 with a close focusing distance of 3cm and excellent detail, with the s95 faring the worst in this test, only allowing you to focus on subjects 5cm away from the lens.
the lx5 has the most detail with excellent detail in both bright and shadow areas, with the s95 giving slightly softer results, and less detail in the shadow areas.
last modified bygonson at 13 sep 2011 - 6:16 am also, i don't understand the fuss about the grip of the canon s95.
i have not worked without an external flash for 40 years, and i already have an olympus fl-36r, so the prices match, and the olympus work i have seen has inspired me more than the work folk have posted from the panasonic.
the panasonic lumix lx5 is an excellent example of how to get a digital camera right, and really sets the benchmark when it comes to the serious compact camera.
the lx5 gave the most detail, with the lowest red-eye of the three.

handling hopefully the specifications and features of each camera has given you an idea of what each of these cameras offers, but it all becomes quite mute if the cameras are unable to offer the speed and image quality to back it up.
unfortunately that size comes at a price, and the most noticeable downsides to the s95's size is the lowest battery life, rated at 200 shots, the camera's slippery when held, and the lack of optical zoom while recording videos.
overall the panasonic lumix lx5 delivers excellent image quality, excellent build quality, excellent lens, rapid performance, and expansion options, making it an exceptional choice for any serious photographer, and is therefore my "editor's choice" and deserves high praise.
it's nice to see how good all 3 cameras are.
all of the cameras are capable of producing excellent images, especially when compared to standard point and shoot cameras, however the strengths and weaknesses are what sets these cameras apart.

i knew the lx5 was probably slightly the best of the bunch based on image quality and features.
to address the point about the canon's handling, there is a guy in the usa called richard franiec who makes an add-on grip for the s95 (and it's predecessor, the s90, which i have) which works really well and improves the handling a lot.
the lx5 gave the most detail, with the lowest red-eye of the three.
the panasonic lumix lx5 is a serious compact with excellent image quality and is a brilliant choice for the serious photographer.
i wanted the combination of 24mm fast aperture (1.8 at wide) lens combined with full manual controls and pocketable.
this is followed by the p300 with a close focusing distance of 3cm and excellent detail, with the s95 faring the worst in this test, only allowing you to focus on subjects 5cm away from the lens.
iso100 the lx5 allows you to photograph your subject when it is just 1cm in front of the lens, producing excellent results.
the lx5 does well at iso3200 although the processing of the noise appears more visible.
the three cameras provide a wide range of features, and go to show that the digital camera market is alive and well, with interesting, innovative, and competitive products, with each model differencing itself enough to make each camera worthy of your attention depending on your needs.
the p300 follows on from that, producing warm, rich colours, while the s95 produces the warmest colours of all with a yellow shift to the image.
all in all i will buy an olympus xz-1, although the lx5 runs it mighty close.

this is a good review, and it's nce to see manufacturers looking at other matters as well as pixel count.
i guess my fingers have superb grip.
it's worth noting that the iso range of the p300 is the lowest, ranging from iso160 to iso3200, the s95 goes from iso80 - 3200, while the lx5 goes from iso80 upto iso3200 at full resolution, with iso6400, and iso12800 available at 3mp.
the canon powershot s95 provided around 200 shots in real use, which matches the cipa rating.
