ok...for a photojournalist, a sport phtographer, a reporter like for a "common user" a digital vs. film question simply makes no sense.
in my humble opinion, it is not the equipment or the media it is the art, the composition, inspiration and good light that makes a good picture.
i'll have to bring (perhaps even legally) that case to their marketting dpt as 3000 euros is quiet an investement, even for a professional.
yes, canon can do 14bit ad conversion, but if the pixel picks up only nosier data at first hand, more resolution in the ad stage simply won't help much - (amplifying the noise)?
the canon 17mm-40mm f4 lens works beautifuly with the 5d and if you want the f2.8 then try the canon 24mm-70mm pro lens.
but nonetheless the 5d is still probably the most affordable full frame around.
a little consideration more: the hasselblad h3d-22 (that's a heavy medium format bazooka) has a 4080x5440 square format sensor that produce a 22mpx file or, in print-size terms, a 13x18 print.
as a keen amateur for 25 years, i've owned a 5d for almost a year now and continue to be wowed by the results it yields, with, like any camera, a discerning eye, a sensitivity for the subject matter and a sense of imagination...
there is a pc connector on the side for studio strobes.
to be perfectly honest, if you were a person that was extremely well versed in the digital tools, your ability to manipulate a photograph for artistic purposes is, and to "tweak" a photograph is so much greater than that if film.
there are few industries as heart-wrenching as the fine art business.
i then went to a local camera store and had the sales person recreate a backlit situation in store with the same results.
just great for reportage, especially in low light situations.
also, compared to film the quality wasn't even close!
aside from all my rambling though, the 5d is definately the best digital camera out there!
nikon's build quality and ergronomics are way ahead of canon's.
i had own my own photo business which i closed about the time i converted to digital in 2003.
i perfectly understand all these older guys that shot film for years and years all of a sudden going, "wow i can do this with this new thing and
03:13 a.m. i started out with pen and ink, moved to pastels, charcoal, watercolor airbrushing.

the difference is that you can shoot 5000 images in one day with out spending $7000 dollars on film and carrying around a 100 pound duffle bag full of film.
a little over sampling and sharpening seems to make a very nice print at 13x19.
the 5d does not shoot at the blazing speeds of the newest canon dslr, but at present neither nikon nor anyone else has a digital camera with the kind of speed the 1d mark iii does.
to make a very long story short: both fuji and canon have their strengths, the canon with the right converter for raw (i prefer canons own one) can produce quite nice looking results, sharp, low noise etc.
sensitivity is adjustable from iso 50-3200 but there is no good reminder of what you've got set and the setting is persistent if you turn the camera off and back on overnight.
dedicated canon accessory flash units mount in the hot shoe above the viewfinder and the camera is able to control flash exposure via a through-the-lens sensor.
but much more important than resouloution is the amount of contrast that you can record.
the daunting nature of the processes involved in film would explain (along with relative cost) the explosion of new digital users.
you can't be going into the bride and groom's face to lock in an exposure reading.
it really is a great camera for what i do, mainly portraiture and some landscape.
memory card i can shoot away all day long and statistically speaking i will have a few great images; with film unless i had tons of cash i would have to plan my shots and make decisions on which to take.
they are very fast for dslrs.
so i am in the same: will continue scanning till they get a product that won't be obsolete in less than five years.
my 20d exposes backlighting perfectly and this camera costs over half as much of a 5d.
canon is a massive company with the $billions to invest in building semiconductor fabrication lines.
i have much more respect for a photographer who creates a wonderful sunset image with both the sky and foreground having a good balance of exposure than someone who merged two images together and created a high dynamic range image.
without reading the manual, you can go into the custom function menu and the camera to lock up the mirror before taking a picture (then set self-timer mode on the drive button and the camera automatically configures itself for a 2-second self-timer delay; press the button and the mirror locks up, then the shutter opens two seconds later).
had i not invested a good number of canon l glasses, i would definitely go for mamiya or nikon d3.
i still can't get over that 5d viewfinder, though, and that's the one absolutely unavoidable drawback of four thirds - technology improvements and price/size economies mean the smaller sensors will just lag 35mm sensors by two or three years (in resolution and sensitivity), but there's no way with that imaging circle to get abigger viewfinder image than the e1's.
looking back over this entire thread, it is astonishing how emotional people can get over film v. digital and canon v. nikon, etc.
patty larue , october 28, 2010; 10:20 a.m. i have the canon 5d and have been using with the 70-200 heavy lens for portrait work and weddings can someone please tell me what other lens to buy to replace this heavy lens for every day before i have to have surgery my neck can not take it.
if you downloadmicrosoft raw image thumbnailer and viewer for windows xp, you can sort photos to some extent just using the standard windows file browser.
my comments have no impact whatsoever on the market image of either canon or nikon.
tom h , october 18, 2006; 09:59 a.m. evita it might be true that if you don't have an eye for shooting photographs a better camera will not change that.
in some respects, art is the way one interprets what one perceives and presents that interpretation so others can experience that expression.
xiaoyuan gu , november 28, 2007; 10:12 a.m. it is time for canon to throw the goodies of 1d mkiii and 40d to a 5d mkii, to seriously compete with the nikon d3.
it certainly depends on the person using the camera and i believe that you need to have the flare and artistic ability to be able to use any camera (including digital) to produce beautiful images.
although i have never shot either, the specs on the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x are very, very impressive.
any advice you have for me would be greatly appreciated.
after much review, i am purchasing the 5d. i think it will be a wonderful brush to paint with.
vincent martin , july 30, 2006; 05:01 a.m. i have read the above and there are a great variety of inputs and some poinient and timely infomrations.
if you dislike digital for some of the reasons vincent or i have brought up you can still use a digital camera like a film camera and make a decision to not use advanced digital editing or decide to not simply hold the trigger down and take thousands of photos at a location to get a few good ones.
whatever software you choose to use, you won't have to spend too much time post-processing due to the eos 5d's inclusion of a mercury switch to orient photos.
in the digital world, however, what you capture in the camera is what you'll be delivering in a jpeg file, unless you go into a photo editing program and take the trouble to crop.
the light meter of both 5ds consistently underexposed when faced with backlit situations.
the noise just looks like a bad quality image to me it doesn't give the atmosphere or mood that film grain does.
the eos 30d and digital rebel are better values.

evita m , october 17, 2006; 03:42 a.m. "digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images " i still think it's the one behind the lens who makes an image terrific or not, the camera itself, whatever camera, just makes a picture.
but somehow, after a few drinks that tasted wierd but have a tequila like effect, i figured that they have some kind of machines were i could use a plastic card to get money out of it.
as a matter of fact, i print photos not posters most of the time.
as with all of the great canon eos bodies over the decades, if you drill down into the custom function menus, you can figure out how to make the autoexposure lock button on the back of the camera into a "burst of af" thumb switch while in manual focus mode.
i won't perform any manipulations such as replacing colors or pasting other "non-original" images into the photoa.
just great for reportage, especially in low light situations.
it's always good to hear people getting good cameras for a good price.
you lose image stabilization, but gain one f-stop in aperture so you can use higher shutter speeds and the viewfinder will be brighter.
tom moore , january 25, 2007; 08:35 p.m. i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film.
after 'restoring' them for presentation at my father's 90th birthday, i found i rather liked the feel of these vintage images and now find myself trying to make new images look old.
more and more people are going digital, thus driving down demand and prices for film gear.
memory card i can shoot away all day long and statistically speaking i will have a few great images; with film unless i had tons of cash i would have to plan my shots and make decisions on which to take.
digicams will all turn to dust but the film cameras of yesterday will be solid as a rock.
i got two cheap lenses: the ordinary ef 28-90 and a voigtlander 19-35mm.
janice m , february 19, 2007; 01:29 a.m. brian's question: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."
if he had not seen the problem, he would not have chosen his words so carefully.
i find myself now with amazing distortions (ellypses) and the canon pro services recently told me it was the "inconvenience" of full frame captors.
having taught photography back in the days when dinosaurs were just crawling out from the sea, i think 'wet' photography will be with us for a long time just as oil on canvas is still here.
on the lcd skintones look washed out, the finally result on my laptop looked fine
i have used a canon 1ds mark i and ii and i found the quality to be excellent.
the only thing that worked was when the salesman used spot metering on the subject's face by going up in his face to lock in the exposure.
you cannot use those mediums in the same way yet you have what is called a 'painting' in the end.
i had considered getting a 30d with the es-f 10-22mm zoom, which has been reported to be a great combination for landscape and architecture photography,
the following images were taken at iso 800: the included lith-ion battery is adequate for a day of active photography, somewhere between 300 and 500 photos plus review.
however, whilst there are many happy-snappers out there, who go from low resolution jpeg straight to printer, without so much as a mention of photoshop or the like, there are also photographers, amateur and professional, who are increasingly learning to understand and use the digital medium to great effect.
if the 5d is a tough as my 30d i will be well pleased.
i agree it would be nice to have the price of canon l series drop.
this sounds great and indeed would be great on a film camera where slide mounts and cropping during enlargement often result in the sacrifice of some of the image at the edges.
incredible photos, i have no more need for film.
if you are a workhorse photographer, that is you are commercial, then you have things like time and money to worry about, and you need to find the best and most efficient and inexpensive tool for the job.
that is a bold statement, but having bought the very same printer myself and seeing the results from images taken with my 5d, i can understand his claim.
at least 3 of the first five pictures are having some exposure issues, and the first one is obviously the worst.
digital allows photographers to experiment and create images with the camera in a way that is much too expensive for most people to do with film.
about the only reason i can see to ante up the extra money and haul around the added weight of the 70-200mm f/2.8l would be if one routinely takes action pictures in low light or if one is obsessively enamored of blurry backgrounds.
that is a rough rounded-off number and a rough way of getting the point across, but it works as very good shorthand in practice when deciding on a lens--and when writing reviews for a general audience.
nedine o'brien , february 27, 2007; 06:21 a.m. greetings all, i've only been studying photography for three years and started doing b&w film in a wet darkroom.
i have come to really enjoy photogarphy as an artform.
in digital, you have to master the craft of working with tools that are intangible, and exist in the realm of mathematics (1's, and 0's).
i have used a canon 1ds mark i and ii and i found the quality to be excellent.
the 30d got jerked off a folding table and hit a concrete floor and bounced first on one corner, next on the lens shade, and finally on it's back.
dynamic range while ok in the 5d is not as good as the s3 pro (and now the s5).
wow, we are in the early stages of digital photography, think how people will see early digital as oldskool and cool, a footprint of our current age.
tom moore , january 25, 2007; 08:35 p.m. i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film.
its hard to find real photographers now as anyone with a fairly good digital is now branding themselves as pro photographers......
as for the 5d, yes, i believe that it has been worth the hype, in spite of its limitations in terms of speed.
do not complain about high digicam prices.
whatever software you choose to use, you won't have to spend too much time post-processing due to the eos 5d's inclusion of a mercury switch to orient photos.
autofocus performance is superb, even in dim light, with 15 af sensors distributed around the frame.
arguing that shooting film is a more creative process than shooting digital is like saying writing a novel with a pen and ink is more creative than using a typewriter or computer.
for taking pictures of sporting events without breaking your arm, you'll want acanon ef 300mm f/4l is usm, (compare prices) (review).
the camera can capture 3 frames per second continuously.
all canonusa could do for me was apologize and take down my information.
even a camera like the d40 has a much superior lcd than the 5d.tests say the nikon's vibration reduction system is better than canon's is system.
you can't keep adjusting your lights and changing your settings.
a good camera without the right glass is useless too tom antonio (italy) , october 18, 2006; 05:49 p.m. i apologize for bad english grammar in my previous post... pedro p. polakoff iii , october 22, 2006; 03:24
i have not thrown away my watercolors or my 35 mm cameras etc., i have just added to what i enjoy.
i'll be a die hard film fanatic as long as the good men and women at kodak keep cranking out the precious 35mms.
the primary advantages of having a digital sensor the same size (24x36mm) as a frame of 35mm film are (1) higher image quality, especially in terms of noise and especially in lower light situations, and (2) the ability to use very wide angle lenses.
wow, we are in the early stages of digital photography, think how people will see early digital as oldskool and cool, a footprint of our current age.
i love the medium format slides in the glassed gepe frames.
the best professional solution isadobe photoshop cs2, which comes with an image editing tool called "adobe bridge".
quico álvarez , december 05, 2007; 06:03 a.m. hi, folks: i am professional, and like that it is not the same to spend $2,000 than $7,000, so i think that my choice should be the eos-5d. the only thing that stops me is not be able to know if this camera's a/d conversion is 12 or 14 bits.
as a keen amateur for 25 years, i've owned a 5d for almost a year now and continue to be wowed by the results it yields, with, like any camera, a discerning eye, a sensitivity for the subject matter and a sense of imagination...
this is particularly the case as i like to take a fair number of wide angle - generally 25mm ( in 35 mm slr speak) to 35mm.
however i know that doing a wedding or journalism is so much simpler with digital.
not unless you want to blow up the image to poster size and then the 13 megapixels of the 5d will be dramatically sharper than the 8 megapixels of the rebel.
so, your max print size will be a great...9,4x14.
you are not asking the design engineers to overcome significant and difficult design compromises by desiging "one wide angle zoom that suits all" etc.
to recharge the battery you must carry a chunky travel charger that plugs directly into a wall socket.
so for many looking for a full frame caera a used 5d may well still be a good buy.
one last thing, i found my 28-80 was not wide enough in some situations for weddings.
i don't know if the 3" lcd will fit onto the back though.
but then i got so many projects going using the "dry" darkroom in my computer.
as soon as you scan a negative to digital in order to make an enlargement, you are losing quality, no matter how good the scanner is.
brandon boghosian , may 26, 2008; 10:55 p.m. alan, the same way hybrid's are killing the suv market.
i'll bring both along with me and use 3 or 4 lenses interchangeably (along with a little lx3 for videos and stereo shots).
i shoot glamour and getting those warm glowing skintones is paramount.
weather proofing, d o f button on the left(i hate it here, total pain to use with your thumb) i just wish that one camera would do all i want, the closest is the 1d mk3.
sometimes readers, in their emotion, do not read quite so carefully.
i would also, obviously, love their to be a price reduction, but that might be wishful thinking.
digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images and are extremely useful tool for the most common circumstances.
i will never miss the kodak 14n that it replaced, although i occasionally miss the aperture rings on my nikon lenses that i had to sell to be able to get both (1) full frame and (2) low noise at high iso.
if you've pressed the playback button and are reviewing images, a quick touch of the shutter release readies the camera to take pictures again.
i have found some really good deals on medium format cameras.
the 70-200mm f/4l is a lot cheaper (the f/4l is is cheaper than the non-is f/2.8l) and a lot lighter (the f/4l is is about half the weight of the f/2.8l is).
i have a friend that purchased a 40d. he likes the fps but wishes he had purchased the 5d. if you have not used a 5d, perhaps you might borrow or rent one and see if it suits you.
as evita m put it so concisely, the real magic lies with the person taking the photograph.. and frequently, the luck of catching a passing moment as it happens.. whether a facial expression or the momentous interplay of light and landscape.
i enjoyed making prints in my dark room i did pr, weddings, events, sports, newspaper work, portraits and even printed some in a couple of other peoples books.
i do, however, use l lenses which i think more important than a couple of megapixels.
the canon speedlite 580ex ii flash, (compare prices) (review) is canon's current top of the line and it usefully covers an angle as wide as a 14mm lens.
it is a patient studio photographer's camera.
owning a 30d with satisfies me quite well, i must say that i miss the perspectives of the full frame, 5d is definitely the choice for me.
there is a greenish hue to everything, which is unnerving when you are under the gun on a paid shoot.
clients get nervous and models get bored and lose interest, you have to capture the moment or you'll lose the momentum.
patty larue , october 28, 2010; 10:20 a.m. i have the canon 5d and have been using with the 70-200 heavy lens for portrait work and weddings can someone please tell me what other lens to buy to replace this heavy lens for every day before i have to have surgery my neck can not take it.
if you are on the street and would like a dependable camera that understands you...go nikon.
(the actual conversion factor is going to be about 1.6 for the canon small sensors, and about 1.5 for the nikon sensors, but 1.5 is close enough to be useful in practice for all of them.)
i have read that nikon produce better color and resolution and that many people are sold more on the amount of megapixles than anything else, please see the link below.
i just got everything in the mail today and i am experiencing major vignetting from this lens.
brian cincotta , february 02, 2007; 04:58 p.m. tom, you made a comment and you said: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."
the remark is also extremely snobbish.
so the only way to frame an image precisely is to take a test picture, look at the edges on the bright 2.5" rear lcd, and then recompose and click again.
if you insist on having a wide-to-tele zoom, the standard choice is thecanon ef 24-70mm f/2.8l usm, (compare prices) (review ), which is useful for event photography such as wedding receptions.
i could buy the 1ds mark ii as a backup (kidding!).
you can't keep adjusting your lights and changing your settings.
we have millions of average joe's with an $800 dslr that can produce great quality artistic photos.....and that will obviously blow the ego of anyone who's labored in a darkroom for any amount of time.
heck, the pentax k10d trounces the 40d due solely to its in body anti shake.
the 5d, on the other hand, is better in the following situations: you have a lot of older canon eos lenses that cast a full-frame image you love wide angle photography and want to have a good choice of wide angle lenses you want to take pictures in low light without a flash you think it is ridiculous to haul around a huge heavy lens designed to cover the 24x36mm frame of film and then only capture the central 15x22mm portion with a small sensor slr.
there are certainly a lot of good nikon cameras, as shown by the reviews at thislink for nikon products.
after that i've found so many scams like that one that i recommend everyone doing the same before they buy their camera online.
microdrives work in the camera, but operate very slowly if you are taking 14 mb raw images.
also i use the 24mm ts-e shift lens a lot for architecture, which would be impossible with any nikon or fuji camera.
it's status as 'last season's fashion' will help drive second hand
the best test really is to hand the camera to a novice and see what happens.
having recently found a great deal on a 16-35l,it seems clear that i should do the right thing and move from a rebel to a 5d(mkii still a little pricey) to get the full-impact of the glass.
a recent review of a top photo printer (and by that i mean one costing over 500 pounds sterling, rather than in the 200 pounds sterling price range) by someone experienced in both digital and darkroom techniques, said that it produced the best prints he had ever seen, including those from a traditional darkroom.
shooting with film makes you think about so much more and makes you get a grip on things that digital will never teach you.
i enjoy film and still purchase film equipment.
he said i should hold off buying it, because that the next upgrade to the 5d was going to be announced pretty soon, ranging from $2500-3500.
i'm no big fan of nikon, i just like the cameras they make.
i enjoy shooting with my elan7, as well as my canon 5d. i have noticed a big difference in image quality going from my xti to the 5d. either way, i have found the driving factor for great image quality is the glass, namely l-glass.
after 'restoring' them for presentation at my father's 90th birthday, i found i rather liked the feel of these vintage images and now find myself trying to make new images look old.
but having a crappy camera and a great eye prevents you from getting the right output especially if you think of commercially gaining from it.
i think the true test of a photographer is attempting to take the same quality images with a film camera, as you can create using a digital camera with hours of photoshop work afterwards.
digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images and are extremely useful tool for the most common circumstances.
without some kind of linguistic shorthand here, we are going to have to teach basic physics every time we try to discuss lens selection--leaving the typical photographer with either glazed eyes or a dumbfounded expression.
i'm very fond of wide lens photography and i wouldn't like to lose my cheap 19-35mm :).
if you need high frames per second, i would not recommend this camera.
if you decide to go the photoshop/bridge route, you might find the dam book: digital asset management for photographers (peter krogh; o'reilly 2005) helpful.
however have been used to 12mp files from the fuji, although it was an interpolated 12mp, and the fujis - both s2 and s3 - made nicer colors.
but somehow, after a few drinks that tasted wierd but have a tequila like effect, i figured that they have some kind of machines were i could use a plastic card to get money out of it.
p.m. combining the 5d's high iso cleanliness + is provides hand held capabilities previously unheard of erwin baeyens , august 13, 2007;
i never considered film photographers artistic because all one was doing was pushing a button.
ofcourse the brand has no impact on the photos you make, and neither does it make you a better photographer than you are.
sure, i could build a great vintage camera for much less money than a 5d, but i'd spend more on film, paper, chemicals and processing in 1 month than i would on a good digital camera.

canon's quality control has diminished in my mind and i'm disappointed that all they would do was document my two cases of dust right out of the box.
the best test really is to hand the camera to a novice and see what happens.
they are very fast for dslrs.
it is disappointing to see the lack of film photography being taught.
each camera had dust in the viewfinder and on the imaging sensor, the second body also had a problem (i thought) with the image numbering system, showing them as _mg_0001 rather than img_0001.
you may still be able to find the canon eos 5d, (compare prices), available from one of our partners.
i found two shops that sell the 5d for $849 and the 400d for $339 which is incredibly cheap.
in a year or two, of course, it will be just one more good camera.

so the only way to frame an image precisely is to take a test picture, look at the edges on the bright 2.5" rear lcd, and then recompose and click again.
but if you would like to present your pictures to your friends an family or any other larger group of people you do a slideshow.
i've done both, and personally, digital allows me sooo much more access to my photos.
so it is not so professional as pretended.
canon is a massive company with the $billions to invest in building semiconductor fabrication lines.
if you are a wide-angle junkie and have a bunch of older canon eos lenses designed for film cameras, you'll love having the eos 5d.
film is more organic and like many examples of older technology it will always have its place and use and class (i have a fine omega mechanical wristwatch; sure it isn't as accurate as a quartz watch but it has class).
i would say that if you have the money to spend on a canon 5d then definately try to get proffesional canon lenses.
guido ersettigh (milan) , october 08, 2006; 05:45 p.m. claudia our friend knows well perspective theory in fact he used a lens that lets you basculate its axis in order to correct perspective distortion along one direction - optical bank lets you move, thanks to the bellow system, in any direction so you can correct distortion along any axis or put an whole item in focus even if it's not parallel to the lens -.
this sounds great and indeed would be great on a film camera where slide mounts and cropping during enlargement often result in the sacrifice of some of the image at the edges.
these may be more expensive than the sigma but the point of having a 5d is so you can produce quality pictures, so go with the quality lens aswell!!
these may be more expensive than the sigma but the point of having a 5d is so you can produce quality pictures, so go with the quality lens aswell!!
my comments have no impact whatsoever on the market image of either canon or nikon.
digital has mainstreamed the amount of people that can produce an amazing shot (by themselves, digital photography largely cuts out the middleman in mainstream film, ie.
it's status as 'last season's fashion' will help drive second hand prices lower.
nicholas eskey , april 03, 2008; 02:10 a.m. i was in ritz camera store today, looking to see if they still had canon 5d's in stock, since most of the camera stores in san diego seem to not, and i spoke with the counter guy about it.
i really don't enjoy the digital darkroom.
i do, however, use l lenses which i think more important than a couple of megapixels.
saying this though, your sigma lens should produce 17mm pictures without a problem.
you could be in the middle ages handing out 8x10 prints to spectators moments after the joust ended in a fatal impalement.
nikon's metering and flash systems are state of the art.
this is a big step up from the 10d and 20d which i use for back up, but i agree that the industry is geting too pricy for consumer or semi pro photographers.
i have the 100mm f/2 just for that first instance, where 2 stops can make a big difference in stopping the motion of a galloping horse.
i make all kind of pictures, from sport to landscape and i am planning to buy the 40 d. however i am very tempted by the 5d. i have 3 lenses all l ones.
i don't believe you can take a grainy image with digital.
it is my opinion that it is "cheating" to use some of the more advanced photoshop functions to manipulate your image because they allow you to create a "better" image than you originally captured.
i see the 5d more adequated for great prints with their big sensor allied with excelent characteristics.
digital is just someone's opinion, but i find it highly inflammatory for no reason at all.
that's why 5d is such an amazing gear, will so is the nikon d3.
difficult to recreat with 35 mm, large format, or even digital cameras.
it is also a good bit less expensive than the nikon d2xs.
i must say that the 5d's image quality is great.
alan cukurs , january 16, 2008; 01:01 a.m. get the 5d. if you like wide, the full frame will be a big benefit.
as evita m put it so concisely, the real magic lies with the person taking the photograph.. and frequently, the luck of catching a passing moment as it happens.. whether a facial expression or the momentous interplay of light and landscape.
i use the 645 lenses on the 5d with a mirex adapter (shift comes in handy, since i do a lot of architecture).
a good photograph on a slide is still better resolution than most digital cameras (perhaps all), but if you scan it - you're re-sampling data, and that will cost you, and you might be better off with having taken the original with a digital camera.
(the actual conversion factor is going to be about 1.6 for the canon small sensors, and about 1.5 for the nikon sensors, but 1.5 is close enough to be useful in practice for all of them.)
but then i got so many projects going using the "dry" darkroom in my computer.
the only thing that worked was when the salesman used spot metering on the subject's face by going up in his face to lock in the exposure.
and traditional slides still have more of both, resoloution and contrast.
not that it matters, but i think one would do better to search for 5d on the eos forum than to pay much attention to the comments here.
ok, i had no plans to shelv my pentax k1000, and even still had a desire to eventually convert an unused bathroom into a darkroom.
i also want to use my 50mm 1.4, especially for low-light photography, so the 5d is the only choice.
i took it to canon factory service and they said there was nothing they could do.
about the only reason i can see to ante up the extra money and haul around the added weight of the 70-200mm f/2.8l would be if one routinely takes action pictures in low light or if one is obsessively enamored of blurry backgrounds.
i use photoshop but only to do the most basic image adjustments such as cropping, resizing, adjusting levels and curves, etc.
the sensor plane is closer to the front of the camera with the smaller sensor cameras, nothing else.
i for one regret immensely never being schooled in film, however there is so much to learn in digital as well.
so, i hope he really did have the inside info, and that a canon "5d ii" is on the way.
05:07 a.m. i have had my canon 5d for about 10 weeks now and i love it a superb camera,you can crop a small part of a file and the result is still very good,i also like the idea of changing the iso for each shot when i want to and i can do it just over a second with no bother at all,the only setting i use is the iso 50 setting for when i want to use it,some times i use the mirror setting so when you press the shutter release the mirror shoots up and went you press the shuter release again it will take the photo which is a good idea when taking macro shots as the mirror will not vibrate then !
all in all, the 5d has made me shoot things i would never have shot without it.
i think this is going to be my next birthday present, its just the weight & cost thats going to hurt - ouch.
highlights can burn out much easier and in the shadows the transition from very dark to real black can be quite sudden.
it has meant a huge learning curve for me.
the small sensor canon bodies turn an exciting 20mm wide angle lens into a boring 30mm perspective.
canon still has a bit to learn from nikon in some areas.
now, though not being a maniac of the very latest gadget, the possibility of a new 5d version makes me slow down my upgrade...
there is no magnification with the smaller sensor cameras.
thus you're able to manually adjust focus but have automatic assistance available when desired.
but i'm not sure i like spending the money for a lens that will only work on the 30d and not the 1d or my canon film bodies.
let the camera rest for a few minutes and the battery voltage will come back.
andrew klerck , may 12, 2007; 04:19 a.m. hey robert, well the 5d is a full frame sensor (like a film slr).
i make all kind of pictures, from sport to landscape and i am planning to buy the 40 d. however i am very tempted by the 5d. i have 3 lenses all l ones.
all in all, the 5d has made me shoot things i would never have shot without it.
that's pretty good market share for grandpa's camera brand!
i have been looking at the 5d as my primary and my 30d as my backup so i won't be losing time changing lenses.
photography in available, i.e., low, light is a pleasure with the canon eos 5d because the typical lenses that you'd use with this camera include the standard 50/1.4 from the film world.
you cannot use those mediums in the same way yet you have what is called a 'painting' in the end.
the canon eos 5d does not have a built-in flash.
note that, as with most digital single lens reflex cameras, the 5d cannot provide you with a preview in the rear lcd because the sensor is occluded by the viewing mirror until you press the shutter release.
a little consideration more: the hasselblad h3d-22 (that's a heavy medium format bazooka) has a 4080x5440 square format sensor that produce a 22mpx file or, in print-size terms, a 13x18 print.
i must say that the 5d's image quality is great.
a community of photographers search all of photo.net photo captions photo tags equipment store home > equipment > canon > eos 5d most popular lenses popular articles missing pages: white balance jon sienckiewicz offers a juiced-up user guide for creative people via his "missing pages" column on photo.net.
if so, i would prefer to get by with the quality small sensor 40d.
i just wish that one camera would do all i want, the closest is the 1d mk3.
--lannie shane phil , july 19, 2007; 12:46 a.m. i have tried both canon and nikon systems, and here is my 2 cents worth: canon is an excellent system if you have the time and patience to play around with its settings, especially the iso which is not automatic.
you are not asking the design engineers to overcome significant and difficult design compromises by desiging "one wide angle zoom that suits all" etc.
i'm saying your argument sounds like someone that hates anything other than film and it just doesn't make any sense.
unfortunately, i'm in the middle of a job and now will have to rely on my 1d to finish it.
i rather, uh, suspect that phil g. is aware of the crop factor if an idiot such as myself is, and that is why he was very careful to insert the word "effectively."
vincent martin , july 30, 2006; 05:01 a.m. i have read the above and there are a great variety of inputs and some poinient and timely infomrations.
but having a crappy camera and a great eye prevents you from getting the right output especially if you think of commercially gaining from it.
one nit: the 100mm f/2 is not the only alternative to the 70-200mm f/2.8l.
i do like the fact that it does have the 35mm size sensors and that it is built so similar to the 30d. i have been price checking and find several hundred dollars variation in prices.
someone commented on how digital is almost catching film resolution or something.
i have been looking at the 5d as my primary and my 30d as my backup so i won't be losing time changing lenses.
put another away, using a 100mm lens is going to give you an effective focal length of [approximately] 150mm when used with the 10d, 20d, 30d, and digital rebel series.
i do not know about the engineering but i seem to get much better pictures in low light situations with the fullframe.
i for one regret immensely never being schooled in film, however there is so much to learn in digital as well.
one last thing, i found my 28-80 was not wide enough in some situations for weddings.
if you are a wide-angle junkie and have a bunch of older canon eos lenses designed for film cameras, you'll love having the eos 5d.
as for printing, guess what, i can print to slides from digital just as easy as printing on paper if i want to go wet.
for my purposes, though, resolution and low light performance aren't huge issues, so my olympus e1 is actually better in other regards: much smaller and lighter, weatherproofed, and better lenses (in my price range).
also i use the 24mm ts-e shift lens a lot for architecture, which would be impossible with any nikon or fuji camera.
in film, someone pains in a dark room for hours, using tangible tools that move and change light as its placed onto a print.
i loved the slide films in the studio.
as for the 5d, i bought mine over a year ago and love it every second of the time i am using it, as well as looking at the finished work.
i will have to get him into a darkroom.
although the d70 would make a great backup camera.
i've done both, and personally, digital allows me sooo much more access to my photos.
i don't own many lenses - 10.5mm and the 18-70 that came with the d70.
with the 5d, what you got with your 20mm lens on the film camera is what you get with the 5d. the canon eos 5d is compact and plasticky, but solidly built.
quico álvarez , december 06, 2007; 02:44 p.m. i found it: eos-5d is 12 bit per channel in color depth.
it is maybe not a spectacular, but a very solid and high quality camera that can give very good files.
so i am in the same: will continue scanning till they get a product that won't be obsolete in less than five years.
they're 13mpx, that's to say near the state of the art for a digital 35mm size-like camera.
digital has mainstreamed the amount of people that can produce an amazing shot (by themselves, digital photography largely cuts out the middleman in mainstream film, ie.
and i am fine with 3-5 fps, as i am, like most people out there, not a sport event shooter (5fps will do the job well, though).
you've successfully driven the price of a eos 3 down to a paltry $248.50 on ebay.
zhero.net jonathan farmer , march 22, 2007; 01:31 p.m. can anyone give a honest opinion on how the 5d, d2xs and the finepix s5 compare with respect to image quality.
usm, (compare prices) (review), which is essential for day-to-day and low light photography, you will probably want the following standard professional zoom lenses: canon ef 16-35mm f/2.8l ii usm, (compare prices) canon ef 70-200 f/2.8l is ii usm, (compare prices)
if so, i would prefer to get by with the quality small sensor 40d.
compared to nikon the full-frame canon eos 5d is cheaper than nikon's top-of-the-line small-sensor body.
if you are rich and dumb, i would definitly suggest going digital.
difficult to recreat with 35 mm, large format, or even digital cameras.
i have to admit, however, that both the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x shoot more frames per second than the 5d.
and traditional slides still have more of both, resoloution and contrast.
for the most part i keep the original raw files and print the best of them.
in all it's been a hell of a workhorse camera for me, producing consistently high quality images even under adverse conditions.
joao pedro jorge , january 13, 2008; 02:36 p.m. i've been reading reviews on the 5d and the 40d because i'm thinking of buying a new camera.
you may want to do what i'm going to do, buy it from a local retailer where you can inspect it first.
no dings, scratches, and best of all no internal damage to camera or lens.
" it's important to remember that even if you can scan something at a million dots per inch - you may just be fooling yourself.
i went digital in 2001 on a trip to egypt to teach laboratory sciences and did not want to cart around several pounds of film together with all the other stuff i brought.
the difference between film and digital isn't that any rich moron can take great pictures with a $7000 camera (they can't).
the viewfinder image is substantially larger than on the small-sensor canon bodies.
in very practical terms, that is, a 600mm lens will give results in terms of image size comparable to 900mm lens when used on a sensor approximately 2/3 the length and width of a full frame sensor.
i only shoot in digital and believe my photography is beauty which i have created and cherish the percentage of the shots which are excellent.
by that time i hope nikon will also be truly in te (full) frame and be producing a lower price competitor so that i can think aout returning to nikon.
digital pictures are different but damn, some of them are of wonderful color and quality.
the lcd is saturated and colors pop.
it's the firlst camera with full frame from this category of cameras.
for the most part i keep the original raw files and print the best of them.
p.m. education bldg albany ny combining the 5d's high iso cleanliness + is provides hand held capabilities previously unheard of erwin baeyens , august 13, 2007; 10:54 a.m. frankly for being such a fantastic camera and for philip being an experienced photographer there are some seriously over exposed pictures on this review.
this is a big step up from the 10d and 20d which i use for back up, but i agree that the industry is geting too pricy for consumer or semi pro photographers.
i already own a sigma 10-20mm and a nikon 18-200mm for this job.
the d2xs is a superb camera, but don't have the large canon's sensor nor the tremendous s5 dynamic range.
i want to be able to deliver to my client larger prints with little or no noise in shadow areas.
i'll be a die hard film fanatic as long as the good men and women at kodak keep cranking out the precious 35mms.
i have a friend that purchased a 40d. he likes the fps but wishes he had purchased the 5d. if you have not used a 5d, perhaps you might borrow or rent one and see if it suits you.
a little over sampling and sharpening seems to make a very nice print at 13x19.
it really is a great camera for what i do, mainly portraiture and some landscape.
i don't see the interpolated finepix megapixels exceed the canon.
you will also see who has thier work hanging in art galleries and museums, and all the true art publications.
danny yee , december 30, 2006; 06:35 p.m. the one thing that really impressed me when i had a play with a friend's 5d was the viewfinder.
you've successfully driven the price of a eos 3 down to a paltry $248.50 on ebay.
arunas salkauskas , december 10, 2006; 02:09 a.m. "a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
incredible photos, i have no more need for film.
compared to th 300d the 5d gives me quality prints close enough to film.
at the 10k range, the benefit of mf is obvious, the single pixel size (pitch) is much larger (8.4um) than the 1ds mkiii's 6.4um.
i do not choose a camera based solely on market share, of course, but such data are not irrelevant to me.
the 70-200mm f/4l is a lot cheaper (the f/4l is is cheaper than the non-is f/2.8l) and a lot lighter (the f/4l is is about half the weight of the f/2.8l is).
the 5d has the standard focus modes of any canon slr: manual, single-shot auto, continuous auto, and "ai focus" where the camera tries to figure out whether or not your subject is moving.
if you take 100 pictures in quick succession, don't be alarmed when the "low battery" symbols flashes.
if the rumors are true and canon is going to come out with a replacement to the 5d i might be interested in that as well.
i have a quality range of l series glass and if i went down the full frame path, would purchase couple of wide angle primes.
a good photograph on a slide is still better resolution than most digital cameras (perhaps all), but if you scan it - you're re-sampling data, and that will cost you, and you might be better off with having taken the original with a digital camera.
i don't own many lenses - 10.5mm and the 18-70 that came with the d70.
my purpose buying it was to do architecture (50% of my assignements) with the 24 tse i already had on a eos 1n rs, amazing lens.
i ended up using it like a (very expensive!)point and shoot.
the 13-megapixel canon eos 5d single-lens reflex digital camera is the first consumer-priced ($2700) full-frame sensor body.
without reading the manual, you can go into the custom function menu and the camera to lock up the mirror before taking a picture (then set self-timer mode on the drive button and the camera automatically configures itself for a 2-second self-timer delay; press the button and the mirror locks up, then the shutter opens two seconds later).
compared to th 300d the 5d gives me quality prints close enough to film.
they are different mediums same as the way you would use either oils or water colours.
in addition, the build quality of nikon cameras is legendary.
it lacks a proper lcd display.
a.m. hi how do you leave the 5d on a tripod and use a self timer that lasts for atleast an hour and shoot continously.
if you are a serious photographer, you will want to purchase and carry a backup bp-511a battery (the same battery that canon has used in the 20d and the gn point-and-shoot models).
yes, canon can do 14bit ad conversion, but if the pixel picks up only nosier data at first hand, more resolution in the ad stage simply won't help much - (amplifying the noise)?
digital is just someone's opinion, but i find it highly inflammatory for no reason at all.
by the same token, i cannot afford any of the more upmarket canon full frame digitals.
shooting with film makes you think about so much more and makes you get a grip on things that digital will never teach you.
had i not invested a good number of canon l glasses, i would definitely go for mamiya or nikon d3.
i do notice that sales are going up and higher resolution, better colours, less distortion etc. is not the last reason for that :) and don't forget glass.
kudos to the many moderate voices above and those that focus on the individual's artistic process above considerations of equipment and technology.
with the 5d, what you got with your 20mm lens on the film camera is what you get with the 5d. the canon eos 5d is compact and plasticky, but solidly built.
i could buy the 1ds mark ii as a backup (kidding!).
sure, i could build a great vintage camera for much less money than a 5d, but i'd spend more on film, paper, chemicals and processing in 1 month than i would on a good digital camera.
the is will help with camera shake more than the extra stop will for the same money.
as for the 5d, i bought mine over a year ago and love it every second of the time i am using it, as well as looking at the finished work.
where to buy you may still be able to find the canon eos 5d, (compare prices), available from one of our partners.
i have won awards in art shows with digital pictures taken with a canon d60 at 6.3 megapixels, printed on an i9900 printer at 13x19.
now, though not being a maniac of the very latest gadget, the possibility of a new 5d version makes me slow down my upgrade...
it makes an image that goes into the computer nice n easy.
with digital one has to be very precise and disciplined in order to not "overshoot" and make thousands of worthless crap pictures without any appeal and interest.
i believe that you have to approach digital completely differently to film.
check out thomas hawk's photos www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk which are never shot with a flash and he often shoots in very lowlight at iso 1600.
i am afraid that the answer is the first one, because canon don't say anything about it in the "specs", anouncing it proudly when they explain the advantages of the new brand eos-1ds mark iii.
if you've pressed the playback button and are reviewing images, a quick touch of the shutter release readies the camera to take pictures again.
the common error that philip greenspun's review push forward is thinking that digital camera is the best solution for all or, in another formulation, that digital camera are simply better than film ones.
i am afraid that the answer is the first one, because canon don't say anything about it in the "specs", anouncing it proudly when they explain the advantages of the new brand eos-1ds mark iii.
a real photographer is the one who composes the shot perfectly and with their knowledge and technical ability will be able to capture a beautiful photo in 1 single shot rather than taking hundreds and finding the best one.
it is more than good enough for most professional photojournalism applications, but still simple enough that a yuppie can get one to throw in the glovebox of his bmw suv and take pictures at the school soccer game.
four years old and still no dust in the viewfinder.
i do not choose a camera based solely on market share, of course, but such data are not irrelevant to me.
nicholas eskey , april 03, 2008; 02:10 a.m. i was in ritz camera store today, looking to see if they still had canon 5d's in stock, since most of the camera stores in san diego seem to not, and i spoke with the counter guy about it.
85mm for portrait, 28 as wide angle, and selective dof/ unsharpness when i wish.
be aware of online scams.
the is will help with camera shake more than the extra stop will for the same money.
the eos 5d is not designed for use in a continuous downpour or very dusty environment like the canon eos 1ds mark ii, though it is a basically rugged and well-sealed design.
sensitivity is adjustable from iso 50-3200 but there is no good reminder of what you've got set and the setting is persistent if you turn the camera off and back on overnight.
the 5d has a green "idiot mode" on the left control dial.
it's just seems ironic to me that a $3000-2500 camera doesn't have a lcd screen as good as my $500 point and shoot.
i'll have to bring (perhaps even legally) that case to their marketting dpt as 3000 euros is quiet an investement, even for a professional.
the d2xs is a superb camera, but don't have the large canon's sensor nor the tremendous s5 dynamic range.
unfortunately that particular lens with 5d seems to produce an elliptical unexpected distortion.
there is a woman who does blurry monotypes from my digital wildlife photos and sells them for more than i can sell the originals.
so, i hope he really did have the inside info, and that a canon "5d ii" is on the way.
amazon... not so much- trying to be everything to everyone has negatively impacted their customer service.
it is also interesting to look here if you want to get one indicator of relative market shares for the various companies, not just canon and nikon--and not just at the high end.
as a canon user with too much money sunk into the system to switch on a whim like the beginners without a good set of lenses or the moneyed elite who seem to switch weekly, i hope that nikon absolutely trounces canon with its new full frame d3 and its d300 cameras.
they're 13mpx, that's to say near the state of the art for a digital 35mm size-like camera.
the light meter of both 5ds consistently underexposed when faced with backlit situations.
when i got my 5d things changed, there are no 'cheat' modes on this camera, you actually have to know what you are doing.
i can readily purchase a quality 40d, but to me that is not going forward.
there is a greenish hue to everything, which is unnerving when you are under the gun on a paid shoot.
p.m. straight from the camera, no photoshop except to sign & size it.
if the rumors are true and canon is going to come out with a replacement to the 5d i might be interested in that as well.
maximum flash sync speed is 1/200th.
(i flew the jet ranger helicopter on the left for three hours while commander chuck street reported the traffic and talked me through the occasional confined or pinnacle approach; i did not fly the helicopter on the right, which is a static display at the titan missile museum near tucson, arizona.)
it's always good to hear people getting good cameras for a good price.
though noisier than a point-and-shoot digital camera, the canon eos 5d is extremely quiet in operation, quieter than any modern film body and with a slightly more muted and lower frequency shutter "thunk" than the small sensor canon bodies.
i use photoshop but only to do the most basic image adjustments such as cropping, resizing, adjusting levels and curves, etc.
in my humble opinion, it is not the equipment or the media it is the art, the composition, inspiration and good light that makes a good picture.
i think i will prbably not upgrade to the canon 5d mk ii as it is too expensive but will wait for the next eolution to appear.
even a camera like the d40 has a much superior lcd than the 5d.tests say the nikon's vibration reduction system is better than canon's is system.
there is a woman who does blurry monotypes from my digital wildlife photos and sells them for more than i can sell the originals.
there are two control wheels so that you can adjust aperture and shutter speed simultaneously.
when working with raw images, this is rather sluggish on all but the very newest and most powerful pcs.
eye relief is just barely adequate for people wearing eyeglasses.
a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
i've got two extra batteries so i may bring them along, although i'm all but certain no one will let me take a photo to test the sensor.
i have shot over 8000 images with my 5d now and evey single one has rivaled the quality of scanned negatives shot with my leica.
the 5d has the standard focus modes of any canon slr: manual, single-shot auto, continuous auto, and "ai focus" where the camera tries to figure out whether or not your subject is moving.
i bought the digirebel (body only) 18 mos ago and this camera paid for itself immediately because i used to spend-at a minimum-at least $100 per month in film and developing.
looking back over this entire thread, it is astonishing how emotional people can get over film v. digital and canon v. nikon, etc.
although not the fastest camera for action shots, it is hardly "a patient studio photographer's camera," and no one who has used it would characterize it thus.
i've got two extra batteries so i may bring them along, although i'm all but certain no one will let me take a photo to test the sensor.
if you have $7000 to spend, a strong back to carry the weight, and a quick mind to take in the many displays and complex user interface, the eos 1ds mark ii might be better than the 5d. the canon eos 5d, however, will do most professional jobs.
images that would have been difficult to attain (or costly, using a pro lab) straight from camera to high street developer.
kudos to the many moderate voices above and those that focus on the individual's artistic process above considerations of equipment and technology.
vertino machado david alpert , march 31, 2007; 11:31 p.m. the 5d is excellent in low light.
home > equipment > canon > eos 5d jon sienckiewicz offers a juiced-up user guide for creative people via his "missing pages" column on photo.net.
after that i've found so many scams like that one that i recommend everyone doing the same before they buy their camera online.
i really enjoyed being in the darkroom.
the canon speedlite 580ex ii flash, (compare prices) (review) is canon's current top of the line and it usefully covers an angle as wide as a 14mm lens.
an alternative is thecanon ef 24-105mm f/4 l is usm, (compare prices) (review), which has the advantages of light weight and image-stabilization at the cost of one f-stop in maximum aperture, which means that the viewfinder will be only half as bright.
i am thinking about a 5d, but frankly i shoot wildlife on the wing that shows well and once in a while sells with the 6.3 i have.
thus you're able to manually adjust focus but have automatic assistance available when desired.
film kills digital, i know this.
and the 50d with its big pixel count in a small crop sensor and the full frame 5d mk ii are both more capable in their noise reduction and in other ways.
i don't really mind if their isn't a significant increase in resolution, but i would love to see the dust reduction system and the 3" lcd off the 1d mark iii.
compared to the more expensive canon bodies if you have $7000 to spend, a strong back to carry the weight, and a quick mind to take in the many displays and complex user interface, the eos 1ds mark ii might be better than the 5d. the canon eos 5d, however, will do most professional jobs.
it really is hard to find a true proffessional photographer.
the creative process is not dependant on the tools.
i'm very fond of wide lens photography and i wouldn't like to lose my cheap 19-35mm :).
microdrives work in the camera, but operate very slowly if you are taking 14 mb raw images.
there is no color settings to adjust the lcd, you can only adjust the brightness levels.
i got two cheap lenses: the ordinary ef 28-90 and a voigtlander 19-35mm.
canon's wide zooms are good, but very far from the level of the nikon.
(seemy photoshop directory for some useful scripts, including those that were used to generate the jpegs you see on this page.)
plus, you can take more...many more of them and print or save only the good photos.
i love the medium format slides in the glassed gepe frames.
whatever lens you get, you will be able to shoot at the correct focal length as opposed to the previous models (20d, 30d etc) which were x1.6 or thereabouts.
i will go digital when they make the first 1,000,000 dollar digital camera which will be 108mp mamiya ofcourse, and it will accept all my rb67 lenses and ektars.
if i decide to switch to canon now is the time since i don't have too much nikon equipment.
i found two shops that sell the 5d for $849 and the 400d for $339 which is incredibly cheap.
we have millions of average joe's with an $800 dslr that can produce great quality artistic photos.....and that will obviously blow the ego of anyone who's labored in a darkroom for any amount of time.
add some fantastic filters (which digital users throw away now) and accessories and you will be taking phenominal pictures no matter what.
because this is not a zoom lens, it has many fewer individual pieces of glass inside and therefore you'll get the highest possible contrast and image quality.
it is much cheaper for canon to make a small sensor than a big sensor.
a recent review of a top photo printer (and by that i mean one costing over 500 pounds sterling, rather than in the 200 pounds sterling price range) by someone experienced in both digital and darkroom techniques, said that it produced the best prints he had ever seen, including those from a traditional darkroom.
any idiot can use a 7000 dollar digital camera.
if i decide to switch to canon now is the time since i don't have too much nikon equipment.
i took it to canon factory service and they said there was nothing they could do.
on the lcd skintones look washed out, the finally result on my laptop looked fine
i don't really mind if their isn't a significant increase in resolution, but i would love to see the dust reduction system and the 3" lcd off the 1d mark iii.
if you're going to take a lot of portraits, e.g., of a baby, and don't want to endure the weight of the 70-200/2.8, consider a primecanon ef 100mm f/2 usm, (compare prices) (review).
without some kind of linguistic shorthand here, we are going to have to teach basic physics every time we try to discuss lens selection--leaving the typical photographer with either glazed eyes or a dumbfounded expression.
that difference really shows now that the making of cameras has come down to "how much can you invest in silicon chips?" the canon eos 5d is the essential camera for everything that photographers used to do with 35mm film.
i would not sell any of my images.
in some respects, art is the way one interprets what one perceives and presents that interpretation so others can experience that expression.
i found it very relaxing.
nikon is a versatile system if you are on the street and every moment counts.
i enjoyed making prints in my dark room i did pr, weddings, events, sports, newspaper work, portraits and even printed some in a couple of other peoples books.
it is much cheaper for canon to make a small sensor than a big sensor.
i shoot mostly landscapes, some architectural and event photography, so the full frame is desired.
a photographer has to be more skilled to use film than digital.
not that it matters, but i think one would do better to search for 5d on the eos forum than to pay much attention to the comments here.
i work mostly with available light so i have to have to make sure i buy a camera that is best for low lighting conditions - i shoot hotel interiors and exteriors as well as very high resolution virtual tours of cockpits.
plus, you can take more...many more of them and print or save only the good photos.
search for prices for the camera i wanted.
this is not a great idea when trying to shoot a wedding.
at least 3 of the first five pictures are having some exposure issues, and the first one is obviously the worst.
you could be in the middle ages handing out 8x10 prints to spectators moments after the joust ended in a fatal impalement.
digital cameras and the digital workflow have made creating or capturing a great image much easier and much more likely for novice and amateur photographers (i admit i am one of these people however i have a "moral code" regarding the level of digital adjustments i will make).
if you are rich and dumb, i would definitly suggest going digital.
that's pretty sad, considering what a tour de force of technology the 5d's sensor is.
just google the name of the shop and reviews, like, in my case was: "bestpricecameras reviews" so, it seems that the cheapest 40d (not scam) price was around $1000 and the 5d around $2200.
the 13-megapixel canon eos 5d single-lens reflex digital camera is the first consumer-priced ($2700) full-frame sensor body.
i still have my old pentax and it is loaded, but i don't know when i'll find the time to take it off the shelf and finish the roll.
viewfinder viewfinder coverage on the canon eos 5d is standard for an advanced amateur single-lens reflex camera, about 96 percent of what is recorded on the sensor is displayed in the viewfinder.
i have shot over 8000 images with my 5d now and evey single one has rivaled the quality of scanned negatives shot with my leica.
saying this though, your sigma lens should produce 17mm pictures without a problem.
so it is not so professional as pretended.
i never considered film photographers artistic because all one was doing was pushing a button.
it is my opinion that it is "cheating" to use some of the more advanced photoshop functions to manipulate your image because they allow you to create a "better" image than you originally captured.
i use the 645 lenses on the 5d with a mirex adapter (shift comes in handy, since i do a lot of architecture).
if you are a serious photographer, you will want to purchase and carry a backup bp-511a battery (the same battery that canon has used in the 20d and the gn point-and-shoot models).
microdrives are also more prone to failure than the solid-state cf cards and i do not recommend them.
the eos 5d is not designed for use in a continuous downpour or very dusty environment like the canon eos 1ds mark ii, though it is a basically rugged and well-sealed design.
although i have never shot either, the specs on the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x are very, very impressive.
in the digital world, however, what you capture in the camera is what you'll be delivering in a jpeg file, unless you go into a photo editing program and take the trouble to crop.
p.m. i have to agree totally with this review of the 5d. as one who has shot leica equipment for over 30 years, this was the system of choice for me when i decided to make the transition from my trusty leica r8's & leica lenses to the digital world of the 5d with ef-l lenses.
it also allows me a greater amount of control over the in camera exposure settings and my results are getting better all the time.
i want to be able to deliver to my client larger prints with little or no noise in shadow areas.
they hold thier value beautifully.
the viewfinder image is substantially larger than on the small-sensor canon bodies.
well, i love the 5d camera, but to dismiss nikon as a small company with clever optical engineers is, well, way, way off.
in very practical terms, that is, a 600mm lens will give results in terms of image size comparable to 900mm lens when used on a sensor approximately 2/3 the length and width of a full frame sensor.
(the guys you see on television might have the 600/4, but that comes in its own suitcase and costs more than a small kia sedan.)
as soon as you scan a negative to digital in order to make an enlargement, you are losing quality, no matter how good the scanner is.
if they have not explored film far enough, and do not require some huge size out of the ordinary output, they probably will not know what they are missing switching to digital.
the primary advantages of having a digital sensor the same size (24x36mm) as a frame of 35mm film are (1) higher image quality, especially in terms of noise and especially in lower light situations, and (2) the ability to use very wide angle lenses.
unfortunately, i'm in the middle of a job and now will have to rely on my 1d to finish it.
my purpose buying it was to do architecture (50% of my assignements) with the 24 tse i already had on a eos 1n rs, amazing lens.
robert ingram , may 11, 2007; 12:39 p.m. i just bought a canon 5d. apparently, the salesperson did not know what they were talking about, because he encouraged me to buy the canon 5d with the sigma dc 17-70 f/2.8 lens.
from where you stay it's normal to have perspective because the viewpoint where you are when taking that photo is lower not perfectly "perpendicular" and also in the middle of the buildyng (sorry my english, i'm not a native...)
a new lineup that is intended to attract a more... there are few industries as heart-wrenching as the fine art business.

i bought the digirebel (body only) 18 mos ago and this camera paid for itself immediately because i used to spend-at a minimum-at least $100 per month in film and developing.
i suggest mr. greenspun do a little more research before making completely invalid statements which mislead camera buyers and uniformed photographers.
it may not make a lot of sense to anyone else, but i've found utility in blue-channel noise that most everyone else wants to disown.
there is no color settings to adjust the lcd, you can only adjust the brightness levels.
i am hoping to use a d2x and get the same quality but maybe the 5d will do well.
lol a bit of dust and air pollution is not enough to name mexico a measure parameter for camera resistance.
the 5d especially is excellent with wide angle and fish eye lenses.
i also enjoy digital photography and have been able to support my hobby by creating portraits for people through digital art.
no, nikon cannot match canon's sensor technology;they are not the electronics giant that canon is.
05:07 a.m. i have had my canon 5d for about 10 weeks now and i love it a superb camera,you can crop a small part of a file and the result is still very good,i also like the idea of changing the iso for each shot when i want to and i can do it just over a second with no bother at all,the only setting i use is the iso 50 setting for when i want to use it,some times i use the mirror setting so when you press the shutter release the mirror shoots up and went you press the shuter release again it will take the photo which is a good idea when taking macro shots as the mirror will not vibrate then !
a cheaper alternative but still good is the tamron range of lenses and they go down to f2.8 aswell for a fairly wide angled lens.
but if you would like to present your pictures to your friends an family or any other larger group of people you do a slideshow.
its hard to find real photographers now as anyone with a fairly good digital is now branding themselves as pro photographers......
ok sure and when i whip out the 11x14 empire state and make selinium oxide silver contact prints (or whatever they are called) you will see who has cooler pictures.
more and more people are going digital, thus driving down demand and prices for film gear.
only canon builds dslr with full frame sensor right now.
you can't be going into the bride and groom's face to lock in an exposure reading.
it makes an image that goes into the computer nice n easy.
when i work i constantly use the histogram and i need to make snap judgments based on the lcd image and my exposure readings.
i won't perform any manipulations such as replacing colors or pasting other "non-original" images into the photoa.
after seeing countless people come in with photos from a hell of a lot of different proffessional cameras, i would have to say that almost everything from the canon 5d has been the closest i have seen to film quality.
too bad even my photos are great with this camera.
the learning curve is real and no less valid than that of understanding film and darkroom techniques.
if you do not create your art and have a bonafide craft in digital art (like making fantastic looking things painstakingly in photoshop or other based primarily on visions in your head), then you are basically putting your faith in those who decided how a certain color etc. should be rendered on a screen ie color spaces, color balance and the like.
for taking pictures of sporting events without breaking your arm, you'll want acanon ef 300mm f/4l is usm, (compare prices) (review).
but i think film camera are still useful today.
both richer and more pleasing, and more "film like".
do not complain about high digicam prices.
if you are a workhorse photographer, that is you are commercial, then you have things like time and money to worry about, and you need to find the best and most efficient and inexpensive tool for the job.
digital has made it too easy for anyone to get into photography (i'm not saying this is a bad thing!).
i shoot mostly landscapes, some architectural and event photography, so the full frame is desired.
even af from basic minolta worked better than mine.
i loved shooting in film for sooo long, but even the negs of the pictures i took are just sitting up in a box somewhere.
there is a diopter adjustment and you can change the focusing screen as well.
by that time i hope nikon will also be truly in te (full) frame and be producing a lower price competitor so that i can think aout returning to nikon.
not unless you want to blow up the image to poster size and then the 13 megapixels of the 5d will be dramatically sharper than the 8 megapixels of the rebel.
collect cans and shoot weddings with a popcan pinhole array!
although not the fastest camera for action shots, it is hardly "a patient studio photographer's camera," and no one who has used it would characterize it thus.
dedicated canon accessory flash units mount in the hot shoe above the viewfinder and the camera is able to control flash exposure via a through-the-lens sensor.
the small sensor canon bodies turn an exciting 20mm wide angle lens into a boring 30mm perspective.
in all things artistic it is the message not the media which is important.
and we all know that good home cooking is best, but sometimes a quick takeaway hits the spot as well.
digital has made it too easy for anyone to get into photography (i'm not saying this is a bad thing!).
having recently found a great deal on a 16-35l,it seems clear that i should do the right thing and move from a rebel to a 5d(mkii still a little pricey) to get the full-impact of the glass.
the learning curve is real and no less valid than that of understanding film and darkroom techniques.
zhero.net jonathan farmer , march 22, 2007; 01:31 p.m. can anyone give a honest opinion on how the 5d, d2xs and the finepix s5 compare with respect to image quality.
evita m , october 17, 2006; 03:42 a.m. "digital camera like canon 5d takes terrific images " i still think it's the one behind the lens who makes an image terrific or not, the camera itself, whatever camera, just makes a picture.
i think i will prbably not upgrade to the canon 5d mk ii as it is too expensive but will wait for the next eolution to appear.
the following images were taken at iso 800: batteries the included lith-ion battery is adequate for a day of active photography, somewhere between 300 and 500 photos plus review.
too bad even my photos are great with this camera.
it lacks a proper lcd display.
the underscore means the white space was changed from srgb to adobe rgb.
one nit: the 100mm f/2 is not the only alternative to the 70-200mm f/2.8l.
just google the name of the shop and reviews, like, in my case was: "bestpricecameras reviews" so, it seems that the cheapest 40d (not scam) price was around $1000 and the 5d around $2200.
the canon eos 5d cannot run on disposable aa batteries.
in other words an image captured with the camera held vertically will appear on a computer screen in a vertical orientation.
you lose image stabilization, but gain one f-stop in aperture so you can use higher shutter speeds and the viewfinder will be brighter.
i find myself now with amazing distortions (ellypses) and the canon pro services recently told me it was the "inconvenience" of full frame captors.
if he had not seen the problem, he would not have chosen his words so carefully.
images that would have been difficult to attain (or costly, using a pro lab) straight from camera to high street developer.
digital unlocks creative possibilities because you never have to worry about how many shots you have left (or how many you need to get the image you want).
this is a photo of pro photographers using predominantly eos systems at the olympics in 2004, a very demanding situation where "every moment counts" (your phrase).
i keep a small pocket-sized book with me with prints of my favorite photos.
i currently own a 20d and prior to purchasing it had actually never used a "real" film camera (don't laugh but the only camera i had used was a single use disposable film camera).
there is no magnification with the smaller sensor cameras.
i am aware that there appears to have been a batch of 5d's that had dust problems, but mine (luckly) was not one of them and when i did finally get somedust on the sensor (bad handling on my part), it was easy enough to clean w/o the need for a sensor cleaning kit or canon' service facility.
ofcourse the brand has no impact on the photos you make, and neither does it make you a better photographer than you are.
being very uneducated on the 5d sensor, i went along with his request.
that is a bold statement, but having bought the very same printer myself and seeing the results from images taken with my 5d, i can understand his claim.
canon still has a bit to learn from nikon in some areas.
highlights can burn out much easier and in the shadows the transition from very dark to real black can be quite sudden.
canon includes some image library management software with the eos 5d, including the zoom browser ex.
--lannie shane phil , july 19, 2007; 12:46 a.m. i have tried both canon and nikon systems, and here is my 2 cents worth: canon is an excellent system if you have the time and patience to play around with its settings, especially the iso which is not automatic.
it may not make a lot of sense to anyone else, but i've found utility in blue-channel noise that most everyone else wants to disown.
having taught photography back in the days when dinosaurs were just crawling out from the sea, i think 'wet' photography will be with us for a long time just as oil on canvas is still here.
autofocus performance is superb, even in dim light, with 15 af sensors distributed around the frame.
being very uneducated on the 5d sensor, i went along with his request.
danny yee , december 30, 2006; 06:35 p.m. the one thing that really impressed me when i had a play with a friend's 5d was the viewfinder.
there are certainly a lot of good nikon cameras, as shown by the reviews at thislink for nikon products.
(the guys you see on television might have the 600/4, but that comes in its own suitcase and costs more than a small kia sedan.)
either way, i have found the driving factor for great image quality is the glass, namely l-glass.
******************************************** hi brian-i don't think i am really qualified to answer any questions in this forum but will take a guess at the answer to this one simply because no one else has replied.
i think all we have seen thus far in the dslr game is not even the entire opening, to use a chess term.
there are no "winners" just have fun with what you like, and stop putting others down just to satisfy your own egomania.
george carter , december 16, 2006; 03:19 p.m. i bought my first dslr a canon 30d about 6 months ago and have been well pleased.
the canon eos 5d cannot run on disposable aa batteries.
i am waiting for the 5d mkii, and keeping my finger crossed that canon with stay with 12mp to keep the single pixel size of 8.2um of the 5d, and come up with a quality lcd such as that found on the new nikons, dust removal (5d is a dust magnet) and liveview functions.
of course, the resolution of the 5d is so high that you could pull out the central 8 mp of a canon eos 5d image and it would be almost as though you had taken the photo with a canon 30d or digital rebel.
one thing to note which i think is common to wide angle lenses, especially cheap lenses, is the light fall off or vignetting around the edges.
i think this is going to be my next birthday present, its just the weight & cost thats going to hurt - ouch.
unfortunately that particular lens with 5d seems to produce an elliptical unexpected distortion.
the camera is always ready when you are.
to be perfectly honest, if you were a person that was extremely well versed in the digital tools, your ability to manipulate a photograph for artistic purposes is, and to "tweak" a photograph is so much greater than that if film.
there are two control wheels so that you can adjust aperture and shutter speed simultaneously.
mercifully, canon does not include a cheap zoom lens as part of a "kit" with the eos 5d.
my oldest son it taking a photography class, and i found out to my dismay, it is a digital photography class.
it is still a great camera but showing its age with only a 4.1 mp imaging sensor.
if you take 100 pictures in quick succession, don't be alarmed when the "low battery" symbols flashes.
people throw away old computers just like they will throw away digital cameras.
if you insist on having a wide-to-tele zoom, the standard choice is thecanon ef 24-70mm f/2.8l usm, (compare prices) (review ), which is useful for event photography such as wedding receptions.
by the same token, i cannot afford any of the more upmarket canon full frame digitals.
my 5ds had a defective light meter.
i have found some really good deals on medium format cameras.
i have to admit, however, that both the nikon d200 and the nikon d2x shoot more frames per second than the 5d.
i see the 5d more adequated for great prints with their big sensor allied with excelent characteristics.
if the 5d is a tough as my 30d i will be well pleased.
personally i dislike taking hundreds of shots to get a few good ones and take my time to capture a great photo.
i have so much control over my images, it scares me.
i would say that if you have the money to spend on a canon 5d then definately try to get proffesional canon lenses.
the creative process is not dependant on the tools.
i've also lost a lot of digital files over the years, but i still have our old slides from the 1960's.
the reason why you don't have perfect paralel lings there.
it certainly depends on the person using the camera and i believe that you need to have the flare and artistic ability to be able to use any camera (including digital) to produce beautiful images.
as a canon user with too much money sunk into the system to switch on a whim like the beginners without a good set of lenses or the moneyed elite who seem to switch weekly, i hope that nikon absolutely trounces canon with its new full frame d3 and its d300 cameras.
i am waiting for the 5d mkii, and keeping my finger crossed that canon with stay with 12mp to keep the single pixel size of 8.2um of the 5d, and come up with a quality lcd such as that found on the new nikons, dust removal (5d is a dust magnet) and liveview functions.
in all it's been a hell of a workhorse camera for me, producing consistently high quality images even under adverse conditions.
i perfectly understand all these older guys that shot film for years and years all of a sudden going, "wow i can do this with this new thing and it is like a million times easier."
i'll bring both along with me and use 3 or 4 lenses interchangeably (along with a little lx3 for videos and stereo shots).
but nonetheless the 5d is still probably the most affordable full frame around.
flash system is average.
operating speed the canon eos 5d turns on almost instantly and has unmeasureable delays for taking pictures, displaying previews, and waking up once asleep.
however i know that doing a wedding or journalism is so much simpler with digital.
and we all know that good home cooking is best, but sometimes a quick takeaway hits the spot as well.
i gave a huge sigh of relief when finally getting a digital slr - i could skip a generation in the process of getting digital prints.
that is a rough rounded-off number and a rough way of getting the point across, but it works as very good shorthand in practice when deciding on a lens--and when writing reviews for a general audience.
software canon includes some image library management software with the eos 5d, including the zoom browser ex.
i think all we have seen thus far in the dslr game is not even the entire opening, to use a chess term.
the 1.6 sensor makes my 400mm 640.
and when i whip out the 11x14 empire state and make selinium oxide silver contact prints (or whatever they are called) you will see who has cooler pictures.
usm, (compare prices) (review), which is essential for day-to-day and low light photography, you will probably want the following standard professional zoom lenses: mercifully, canon does not include a cheap zoom lens as part of a "kit" with the eos 5d.
as a matter of fact, i print photos not posters most of the time.
each camera had dust in the viewfinder and on the imaging sensor, the second body also had a problem (i thought) with the image numbering system, showing them as _mg_0001 rather than img_0001.
i've read many posts regarding dust issues right out of the box.
i shoot glamour and getting those warm glowing skintones is paramount.
you will also see who has thier work hanging in art galleries and museums, and all the true art publications.
but much more important than resouloution is the amount of contrast that you can record.
one thing to note which i think is common to wide angle lenses, especially cheap lenses, is the light fall off or vignetting around the edges.
the richness and detail of his photos at 1600 are amazing.
it is more than good enough for most professional photojournalism applications, but still simple enough that a yuppie can get one to throw in the glovebox of his bmw suv and take pictures at the school soccer game.
there are no "winners" just have fun with what you like, and stop putting others down just to satisfy your own egomania.
xiaoyuan gu , november 28, 2007; 10:12 a.m. it is time for canon to throw the goodies of 1d mkiii and 40d to a 5d mkii, to seriously compete with the nikon d3.
what about autofocus in 5d. i've heard lot complaints from those who used nikon d200 and switched to canon 5d. after this they appreciate af they used to have in nikon.
i have read that nikon produce better color and resolution and that many people are sold more on the amount of megapixles than anything else, please see the link below.
owning a 30d with satisfies me quite well, i must say that i miss the perspectives of the full frame, 5d is definitely the choice for me.
if you're considering purchasing this camera from an online retailer, buyer beware.
i love the fact that the 5d has 12.8 megs of image boosting power but for difficult shoots i find myself using the 20d. i really think canon dropped the ball on this one.
it is also a good bit less expensive than the nikon d2xs.
i think the true test of a photographer is attempting to take the same quality images with a film camera, as you can create using a digital camera with hours of photoshop work afterwards.
the difference is that you can shoot 5000 images in one day with out spending $7000 dollars on film and carrying around a 100 pound duffle bag full of film.
i am hoping to use a d2x and get the same quality but maybe the 5d will do well.
i noticed the vingetting.
i also want to use my 50mm 1.4, especially for low-light photography, so the 5d is the only choice.
from where you stay it's normal to have perspective because the viewpoint where you are when taking that photo is lower not perfectly "perpendicular" and also in the middle of the buildyng (sorry my english, i'm not a native...)

i gave a huge sigh of relief when finally getting a digital slr - i could skip a generation in the process of getting digital prints.
i believe that you have to approach digital completely differently to film.
i only shoot in digital and believe my photography is beauty which i have created and cherish the percentage of the shots which are excellent.
i had considered getting a 30d with the es-f 10-22mm zoom, which has been reported to be a great combination for landscape and architecture photography, but i'm not sure i like spending the money for a lens that will only work on the 30d and not the 1d or my canon film bodies.
i would like to return to the days of full frame picutures and hence the 5d appeals, even if the "motor drive" is limited to 3 fps.
i loved shooting in film for sooo long, but even the negs of the pictures i took are just sitting up in a box somewhere.
not enough people have the resources to set up a full b&w/color photo lab to be able to manipulate photo's on the required level of "fine art".
what about autofocus in 5d. i've heard lot complaints from those who used nikon d200 and switched to canon 5d. after this they appreciate af they used to have in nikon.
a photographer has to be more skilled to use film than digital.
someone commented on how digital is almost catching film resolution or something.
i'm in the market for a 5d and wouldn't mind waiting if i knew what the feature set would be.
hi brian-i don't think i am really qualified to answer any questions in this forum but will take a guess at the answer to this one simply because no one else has replied.
the common error that philip greenspun's review push forward is thinking that digital camera is the best solution for all or, in another formulation, that digital camera are simply better than film ones.
i don't believe you can take a grainy image with digital.
amazon... not so much- trying to be everything to everyone has negatively impacted their customer service.
with the 50/1.4 lens: the 16-35/2.8l lens: the 24-70/2.8l lens (mostly from the robinson r44): one perceived problem with professional-grade cameras is that they can't be used by novices.
digital unlocks creative possibilities because you never have to worry about how many shots you have left (or how many you need to get the image you want).
some reviewers think that the 70-200mm f/4l is is a "better" lens (sharpness, etc) than the f/2.8l at the same apertures.
maximum flash sync speed is 1/200th.
the only disadvantage to having a full-frame sensor compared to a small-sensor digital slr body (canon digital rebel or any nikon) is that the small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses, which can be useful when you are doing sports or bird photography.
they are different mediums same as the way you would use either oils or water colours.
i'm in the market for a 5d and wouldn't mind waiting if i knew what the feature set would be.
i went digital in 2001 on a trip to egypt to teach laboratory sciences and did not want to cart around several pounds of film together with all the other stuff i brought.
not enough people have the resources to set up a full b&w/color photo lab to be able to manipulate photo's on the required level of "fine art".
to recharge the battery you must carry a chunky travel charger that plugs directly into a wall socket.
after much review, i am purchasing the 5d. i think it will be a wonderful brush to paint with.
this is very useful for tripod and macro work.
a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
to make a very long story short: both fuji and canon have their strengths, the canon with the right converter for raw (i prefer canons own one) can produce quite nice looking results, sharp, low noise etc.
find a extremely rare and sought after collectors film camera and outfit it with the outstanding rare and obscure sought after glass.
arunas salkauskas , december 10, 2006; 02:09 a.m. "a 35mm slide scanned with a 4000dpi scan (like a coolscan 5000) gives to you a 3946x5782=22,8mpx file that you can print 13x18.
" it's important to remember that even if you can scan something at a million dots per inch - you may just be fooling yourself.
digital camera which will be 108mp mamiya ofcourse, and it will accept all my rb67 lenses and ektars.
no dings, scratches, and best of all no internal damage to camera or lens.
i do like the fact that it does have the 35mm size sensors and that it is built so similar to the 30d. i have been price checking and find several hundred dollars variation in prices.
nedine o'brien , february 27, 2007; 06:21 a.m. greetings all, i've only been studying photography for three years and started doing b&w film in a wet darkroom.
the 5d does not shoot at the blazing speeds of the newest canon dslr, but at present neither nikon nor anyone else has a digital camera with the kind of speed the 1d mark iii does.
some reviewers think that the 70-200mm f/4l is is a "better" lens (sharpness, etc) than the f/2.8l at the same apertures.
i also enjoy digital photography and have been able to support my hobby by creating portraits for people through digital art.
i have the 100mm f/2 just for that first instance, where 2 stops can make a big difference in stopping the motion of a galloping horse.
heck, the pentax k10d trounces the 40d due solely to its in body anti shake.
with digital one has to be very precise and disciplined in order to not "overshoot" and make thousands of worthless crap pictures without any appeal and interest.
but i noticed right away when shooting some models with strobes, they looked like crap and i though my light meter was off.
however have been used to 12mp files from the fuji, although it was an interpolated 12mp, and the fujis - both s2 and s3 - made nicer colors.
people throw away old computers just like they will throw away digital cameras.
i would guess that the photographer (myself included) can take way more pictures and cheaper than using film because digital pictures are all free until processed.
i had own my own photo business which i closed about the time i converted to digital in 2003.
the camera is always ready when you are.
if you downloadmicrosoft raw image thumbnailer and viewer for windows xp, you can sort photos to some extent just using the standard windows file browser.
the full-frame canon eos 5d is cheaper than nikon's top-of-the-line small-sensor body.
i would guess that the photographer (myself included) can take way more pictures and cheaper than using film because digital pictures are all free until processed.
this is a photo of pro photographers using predominantly eos systems at the olympics in 2004, a very demanding situation where "every moment counts" (your phrase).
i don't know if the 3" lcd will fit onto the back though.
jeremey barrett , may 18, 2007; 12:22 a.m. robert (ingram), the sigma dc 17-70 is designed for aps-c sized sensors, not full frame sensors like the 5d. the salesperson should absolutely have known that and they should take it back, it simply won't produce usable images on the 5d (light is only going to fall on portion of the sensor).
find a extremely rare and sought after collectors film camera and outfit it with the outstanding rare and obscure sought after glass.
it has meant a huge learning curve for me.
in film, someone pains in a dark room for hours, using tangible tools that move and change light as its placed onto a print.
as for printing, guess what, i can print to slides from digital just as easy as printing on paper if i want to go wet.
nikon is a small company with clever optical engineers.
" conclusion the canon eos 5d is the essential camera for everything that photographers used to do with 35mm film.
i'm torn on buying the 5d. this dust thing seems to be an issue, vignetting due to light not falling evenly on full frame sensors(apparently a big problem for canon right now).
in digital, you have to master the craft of working with tools that are intangible, and exist in the realm of mathematics (1's, and 0's).
no, nikon cannot match canon's sensor technology;they are not the electronics giant that canon is.
any idiot can use a 7000 dollar digital camera.
10:54 a.m. frankly for being such a fantastic camera and for philip being an experienced photographer there are some seriously over exposed pictures on this review.
the canon 17mm-40mm f4 lens works beautifuly with the 5d and if you want the f2.8 then try the canon 24mm-70mm pro lens.
as for the 5d, yes, i believe that it has been worth the hype, in spite of its limitations in terms of speed.
the reason why you don't have perfect paralel lings there.
i still have my old pentax and it is loaded, but i don't know when i'll find the time to take it off the shelf and finish the roll.
the canon eos 5d turns on almost instantly and has unmeasureable delays for taking pictures, displaying previews, and waking up once asleep.
the daunting nature of the processes involved in film would explain (along with relative cost) the explosion of new digital users.
the 5d has a green "idiot mode" on the left control dial.
aside from all my rambling though, the 5d is definately the best digital camera out there!
i do not know about the engineering but i seem to get much better pictures in low light situations with the fullframe.
tom h , october 18, 2006; 09:59 a.m. evita it might be true that if you don't have an eye for shooting photographs a better camera will not change that.
in other words an image captured with the camera held vertically will appear on a computer screen in a vertical orientation.
in addition, the build quality of nikon cameras is legendary.
i enjoy film and still purchase film equipment.
it is maybe not a spectacular, but a very solid and high quality camera that can give very good files.
would be quite happy using l series primes, only need to purchase 25mm l and that would complete my lens complement.
it's just seems ironic to me that a $3000-2500 camera doesn't have a lcd screen as good as my $500 point and shoot.
i still can't get over that 5d viewfinder, though, and that's the one absolutely unavoidable drawback of four thirds - technology improvements and price/size economies mean the smaller sensors will just lag 35mm sensors by two or three years (in resolution and sensitivity), but there's no way with that imaging circle to get abigger viewfinder image than the e1's.
in a year or two, of course, it will be just one more good camera.
digicams will all turn to dust but the film cameras of yesterday will be solid as a rock.
i have a quality range of l series glass and if i went down the full frame path, would purchase couple of wide angle primes.
janice m , february 19, 2007; 01:29 a.m. brian's question: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."
joao pedro jorge , january 13, 2008; 02:36 p.m. i've been reading reviews on the 5d and the 40d because i'm thinking of buying a new camera.
that's why 5d is such an amazing gear, will so is the nikon d3.
the difference between film and digital isn't that any rich moron can take great pictures with a $7000 camera (they can't).
i have covered a summarised review on my website: http://digital_camera_reviews.protechltd.com folarin s , february 05, 2009; 09:00 p.m. a new perspective as a new member on photo.net,i have to say that many of the above views relating to the respective merits of film vs. digital and full frame vs 1.6 crop factor have been tremendously helpful.
in all things artistic it is the message not the media which is important.
i had two samples of this camera sent to me by b&h and canon broke my heart twice (actually 3 times!).
a cheaper alternative but still good is the tamron range of lenses and they go down to f2.8 aswell for a fairly wide angled lens.
similarly, if we assert that digital photographers are somehow disadvantaged by having to contend with the colour space interpretations of a third-party, while not mentioning the colour bias traditionally imparted by different makes of film, it seems nonsensical.
sometimes readers, in their emotion, do not read quite so carefully.
while i was impressed with the images, i'm disappointed that i'm returned the camera again.
whatever lens you get, you will be able to shoot at the correct focal length as opposed to the previous models (20d, 30d etc) which were x1.6 or thereabouts.
i don't see the interpolated finepix megapixels exceed the canon.
any price that would fall more than, lets say, 20% or more out of that was proven to be a scam (in all cases).
it's the firlst camera with full frame from this category of cameras.
i have not experienced any camera software problems or freezes.
i typically am not shooting high speed photography so the 3 fps works well.
george carter , december 16, 2006; 03:19 p.m. i bought my first dslr a canon 30d about 6 months ago and have been well pleased.
the 30d got jerked off a folding table and hit a concrete floor and bounced first on one corner, next on the lens shade, and finally on it's back.
the picasa program from google also can understand the eos 5d's .cr2 raw files.
i then went to a local camera store and had the sales person recreate a backlit situation in store with the same results.
i use photoshop and shoot raw.
let the camera rest for a few minutes and the battery voltage will come back.
the camera has an internal buffer memory for rapid sequence photography (17 raws or 60 jpegs).
as with all of the great canon eos bodies over the decades, if you drill down into the custom function menus, you can figure out how to make the autoexposure lock button on the back of the camera into a "burst of af" thumb switch while in manual focus mode.
this is particularly the case as i like to take a fair number of wide angle - generally 25mm ( in 35 mm slr speak) to 35mm.
the canon always looks to me like reduced, i guess it is the color palette, or the cmos sensors.
if they have not explored film far enough, and do not require some huge size out of the ordinary output, they probably will not know what they are missing switching to digital.
i'm torn on buying the 5d. this dust thing seems to be an issue, vignetting due to light not falling evenly on full frame sensors(apparently a big problem for canon right now).
of course, the resolution of the 5d is so high that you could pull out the central 8 mp of a canon eos 5d image and it would be almost as though you had taken the photo with a canon 30d or digital rebel.
well, i love the 5d camera, but to dismiss nikon as a small company with clever optical engineers is, well, way, way off.
if you are on the street and would like a dependable camera that understands you...go nikon.
i've seen some great stuff from my students using pin-hole cameras.
personally i dislike taking hundreds of shots to get a few good ones and take my time to capture a great photo.
lol a bit of dust and air pollution is not enough to name mexico a measure parameter for camera resistance.
controls canon's eos 5d has the standard four exposure modes: metered manual, aperture-priority, shutter-priority, and program autoexposure.
the sensor plane is closer to the front of the camera with the smaller sensor cameras, nothing else.
but canon doesn't communicate at all on problems with this particular lens and generally says it efficient in all situations.
but if you are smart and creative and artistic (and do not prefer to show this through computer illustration) but rather photography, shoot film.
the 5d, on the other hand, is better in the following situations: the canon eos 5d has an almost identical and equally simple user interface to the cheaper canon 20d and 30d bodies.
jean-baptiste avril , may 23, 2006; 03:55 p.m. ellypses look at verticals at the right building bought an eos 5d two months ago.
also, compared to film the quality wasn't even close!
the 5d especially is excellent with wide angle and fish eye lenses.
i ended up using it like a (very expensive!)point and shoot.
i am thinking about a 5d, but frankly i shoot wildlife on the wing that shows well and once in a while sells with the 6.3 i have.
here are some things that would be nice for the next version of the 5d: reminder of what iso speed is set automatic iso mode smart enough to look at the shutter speed and whether or not the camera is sufficiently stable (i.e., tripod or not) and set the iso accordingly to avoid camera shake compared to the cheaper canon bodies can you get a dramatically better photo with the eos 5d and a canon 50/1.4 compared to what you'd get withcanon digital rebel xti (black) and sigma 30mm f/1.4
digital allows photographers to experiment and create images with the camera in a way that is much too expensive for most people to do with film.
this is very useful for tripod and macro work.
i will never miss the kodak 14n that it replaced, although i occasionally miss the aperture rings on my nikon lenses that i had to sell to be able to get both (1) full frame and (2) low noise at high iso.
featured merchants canon eos 5d 12.8 megapixel digital slr camera body with lens kit - 0.94"-4.13" vendor vendor rating availability price there are currently no sellers for this product.
though noisier than a point-and-shoot digital camera, the canon eos 5d is extremely quiet in operation, quieter than any modern film body and with a slightly more muted and lower frequency shutter "thunk" than the small sensor canon bodies.
flash the canon eos 5d does not have a built-in flash.
ok, i had no plans to shelv my pentax k1000, and even still had a desire to eventually convert an unused bathroom into a darkroom.
both richer and more pleasing, and more "film like".
the noise just looks like a bad quality image to me it doesn't give the atmosphere or mood that film grain does.
after seeing countless people come in with photos from a hell of a lot of different proffessional cameras, i would have to say that almost everything from the canon 5d has been the closest i have seen to film quality.
dynamic range while ok in the 5d is not as good as the s3 pro (and now the s5).
i.e., sports photographers might want to consider one of the eos 1d bodies specifically designed for their rapid-fire needs.
crop and zoom are clear and sharp.
a.m. hi how do you leave the 5d on a tripod and use a self timer that lasts for atleast an hour and shoot continously.
i had two samples of this camera sent to me by b&h and canon broke my heart twice (actually 3 times!).
canon 5d or 1d are beautiful cameras but i think film camera are still useful today.
it really is hard to find a true proffessional photographer.
so the 3 fps works well.
i have done clay, batique as well as crayons.
there is a pc connector on the side for studio strobes.
you may want to do what i'm going to do, buy it from a local retailer where you can inspect it first.
when you are deciding on which lens designed for 24 x 36 should be used with a camera having a sensor 2/3 the length and width of that, you can use the multiplicative inverse of 2/3, which is 1.5, and thereby compute what the effective focal length will be as it affects magnification, i.e., image size.
but canon doesn't communicate at all on problems with this particular lens and generally says it efficient in all situations.
the underscore means the white space was changed from srgb to adobe rgb.
i would not sell any of my images.
i have won awards in art shows with digital pictures taken with a canon d60 at 6.3 megapixels, printed on an i9900 printer at 13x19.
so, your max print size will be a great...9,4x14.
i just got everything in the mail today and i am experiencing major vignetting from this lens.
i found it very relaxing.
i rather, uh, suspect that phil g. is aware of the crop factor if an idiot such as myself is, and that is why he was very careful to insert the word "effectively."
if you need high frames per second, i would not recommend this camera.
the canon eos 5d has an almost identical and equally simple user interface to the cheaper canon 20d and 30d bodies.
available light photography in available, i.e., low, light is a pleasure with the canon eos 5d because the typical lenses that you'd use with this camera include the standard 50/1.4 from the film world.
would be quite happy using l series primes, only need to purchase 25mm l and that would complete my lens complement.
now that we are at this point, give me a linhof super technika only it is an 8x10 and a mountain of 8x10 polaroid film and a processor.
it does just about everything that an $7000 eos 1ds body from 2004 did at about half the weight (2 lbs).
i have much more respect for a photographer who creates a wonderful sunset image with both the sky and foreground having a good balance of exposure than someone who merged two images together and created a high dynamic range image.
i have not thrown away my watercolors or my 35 mm cameras etc., i have just added to what i enjoy.
when you are deciding on which lens designed for 24 x 36 should be used with a camera having a sensor 2/3 the length and width of that, you can use the multiplicative inverse of 2/3, which is 1.5, and thereby compute what the effective focal length will be as it affects magnification, i.e., image size.
but i noticed right away when shooting some models with strobes, they looked like crap
nikon's build quality and ergronomics are way ahead of canon's.
put another away, using a 100mm lens is going to give you an effective focal length of [approximately] 150mm when used with the 10d, 20d, 30d, and digital rebel series.
03:13 a.m. i started out with pen and ink, moved to pastels, charcoal, watercolor airbrushing.
i would like to return to the days of full frame picutures and hence the 5d appeals, even if the "motor drive" is limited to 3 fps.
i work mostly with available light so i have to have to make sure i buy a camera that is best for low lighting conditions - i shoot hotel interiors and exteriors as well as very high resolution virtual tours of cockpits.
85mm for portrait, 28 as wide angle, and selective dof/ unsharpness when i wish.
microdrives are also more prone to failure than the solid-state cf cards and i do not recommend them.
i already own a sigma 10-20mm and a nikon 18-200mm for this job.
and i am fine with 3-5 fps, as i am, like most people out there, not a sport event shooter (5fps will do the job well, though).
i just can't seem to get a saturated look on the lcd and it causes frustration during the shoot.
the best is the enemy of the good and is hard on the pandl.
a good camera without the right glass is useless too tom antonio (italy) , october 18, 2006; 05:49 p.m. i apologize for bad english grammar in my previous post... pedro p. polakoff iii , october 22, 2006; 03:24
only canon builds dslr with full frame sensor right now.
asher . , april 14, 2007; 02:01 p.m.b&h, not amazon phil- not sure if pn has some backroom deal going with amazon, but by far the best mail order photography supplier isb&h photo: huge selection, iron-clad reputation, great prices, super fast shipping, and the best customer service i've ever experienced.
it is still a great camera but showing its age with only a 4.1 mp imaging sensor.
add some fantastic filters (which digital users throw away now) and accessories and you will be taking phenominal pictures no matter what.
arguing that shooting film is a more creative process than shooting digital is like saying writing a novel with a pen and ink is more creative than using a typewriter or computer.
if you dislike digital for some of the reasons vincent or i have brought up you can still use a digital camera like a film camera and make a decision to not use advanced digital editing or decide to not simply hold the trigger down and take thousands of photos at a location to get a few good ones.
reliability and durability i've had this eos 5d for nearly a year and it has survived a trip through mexico and being vibrated for two cross-country helicopter trips.
while i was impressed with the images, i'm disappointed that i'm returned the camera again.
viewfinder coverage on the canon eos 5d is standard for an advanced amateur single-lens reflex camera, about 96 percent of what is recorded on the sensor is displayed in the viewfinder.
any price that would fall more than, lets say, 20% or more out of that was proven to be a scam (in all cases).
the only disadvantage to having a full-frame sensor compared to a small-sensor digital slr body (canon digital rebel or any nikon) is that the small-sensor effectively increases the magnification of telephoto lenses, which can be useful when you are doing sports or bird photography.
jeremey barrett , may 18, 2007; 12:22 a.m. robert (ingram), the sigma dc 17-70 is designed for aps-c sized sensors, not full frame sensors like the 5d. the salesperson should absolutely have known that and they should take it back, it simply won't produce usable images on the 5d (light is only going to fall on portion of the sensor).
for my purposes, though, resolution and low light performance aren't huge issues, so my olympus e1 is actually better in other regards: much smaller and lighter, weatherproofed, and better lenses (in my price range).
my 20d exposes backlighting perfectly and this camera costs over half as much of a 5d.
i just can't seem to get a saturated look on the lcd and it causes frustration during the shoot.
i'm no big fan of nikon, i just like the cameras they make.
balancing flash and natural light is straightforward.
however, whilst there are many happy-snappers out there, who go from low resolution jpeg straight to printer, without so much as a mention of photoshop or the like, there are also photographers, amateur and professional, who are increasingly learning to understand and use the digital medium to great effect.
but if you are smart and creative and artistic (and do not prefer to show this through computer illustration) but rather photography, shoot film.
film is more organic and like many examples of older technology it will always have its place and use and class (i have a fine omega mechanical wristwatch; sure it isn't as accurate as a quartz watch but it has class).
a real photographer is the one who composes the shot perfectly and with their knowledge and technical ability will be able to capture a beautiful photo in 1 single shot rather than taking hundreds and finding the best one.
collect cans and shoot weddings with a popcan pinhole array!
i currently own a 20d and prior to purchasing it had actually never used a "real" film camera (don't laugh but the only camera i had used was a single use disposable film camera).
it is also interesting to look here if you want to get one indicator of relative market shares for the various companies, not just canon and nikon--and not just at the high end.
if you're considering purchasing this camera from an online retailer, buyer beware.
i keep a small pocket-sized book with me with prints of my favorite photos.
an alternative is thecanon ef 24-105mm f/4 l is usm, (compare prices) (review), which has the advantages of light weight and image-stabilization at the cost of one f-stop in maximum aperture, which means that the viewfinder will be only half as bright.
i.e., sports photographers might want to consider one of the eos 1d bodies specifically designed for their rapid-fire needs.
i've read many posts regarding dust issues right out of the box.
if you decide to go the photoshop/bridge route, you might find the dam
however i like to use lenses as with film cameras: no crop factor.
nikon is a small company with clever optical engineers.
similarly, if we assert that digital photographers are somehow disadvantaged by having to contend with the colour space interpretations of a third-party, while not mentioning the colour bias traditionally imparted by different makes of film, it seems nonsensical.
now that we are at this point, give me a linhof super technika only it is an 8x10 and a mountain of 8x10 polaroid film and a processor.
i do notice that sales are going up and higher resolution, better colours, less distortion etc. is not the last reason for that :) and don't forget glass.
digital pictures are different but damn, some of them are of wonderful color and quality.
i enjoy shooting with my elan7, as well as my canon 5d. i have noticed a big difference in image quality going from my xti to the 5d.
i've had this eos 5d for nearly a year and it has survived a trip through mexico and being vibrated for two cross-country helicopter trips.
quico álvarez , december 05, 2007; 06:03 a.m. hi, folks: i am professional, and like that it is not the same to spend $2,000 than $7,000, so i think that my choice should be the eos-5d. the only thing that stops me is not be able to know if this camera's a/d conversion is 12 or 14 bits.
when i work i constantly use the histogram and i need to make snap judgments based on the lcd image and my exposure readings.
that's pretty sad, considering what a tour de force of technology the 5d's sensor is.
brian cincotta , february 02, 2007; 04:58 p.m. tom, you made a comment and you said: "i am able to shoot significantly cheaper per shot then then i ever did with film."
because this is not a zoom lens, it has many fewer individual pieces of glass inside and therefore you'll get the highest possible contrast and image quality.
but in order to do that you first have to downsize the pictures to match the beamer's resoloution, which is somewhat less than 1.75mp if it is bang up to date and hd-ready with 1080i.
the best professional solution isadobe photoshop cs2, which comes with an image editing tool called "adobe bridge".
guido ersettigh (milan) , october 08, 2006; 05:45 p.m. claudia our friend knows well perspective theory in fact he used a lens that lets you basculate its axis in order to correct perspective distortion along one direction - optical bank lets you move, thanks to the bellow system, in any direction so you can correct distortion along any axis or put an whole item in focus even if it's not parallel to the lens -.
and the 50d with its big pixel count in a small crop sensor and the full frame 5d mk ii are both more capable in their noise reduction and in other ways.
but in order to do that you first have to downsize the pictures to match the beamer's resoloution, which is somewhat less than 1.75mp if it is bang up to date and hd-ready with 1080i.
at the 10k range, the benefit of mf is obvious, the single pixel size (pitch) is much larger (8.4um) than the 1ds mkiii's 6.4um.
the picasa program from google also can understand the eos 5d's .cr2 raw files.
robert ingram , may 11, 2007; 12:39 p.m. i just bought a canon 5d. apparently, the salesperson did not know what they were talking about, because he encouraged me to buy the canon 5d with the sigma dc 17-70 f/2.8 lens.
camera is just great, but for the tse system... http://www.jb-avril.com tony (anthony) rowell , july 08, 2006;
check out thomas hawk's photos www.flickr.com/photos/thomashawk which are never shot with a flash and he often shoots in very lowlight at iso 1600.
i've also lost a lot of digital files over the years, but i still have our old slides from the 1960's.
note that, as with most digital single lens reflex cameras, the 5d cannot provide you with a preview in the rear lcd because the sensor is occluded by the viewing mirror until you press the shutter release.
you will have more fun.
so for many looking for a full frame caera a used 5d may well still be a good buy.
(seemy photoshop directory for some useful scripts, including those that were used to generate the jpegs you see on this page.)
i would also, obviously, love their to be a price reduction, but that might be wishful thinking.
the richness and detail of his photos at 1600 are amazing.
if you're going to take a lot of portraits, e.g., of a baby, and don't want to endure the weight of the 70-200/2.8, consider a primecanon ef 100mm f/2 usm, (compare prices) (review).
if you do not create your art and have a bonafide craft in digital art (like making fantastic looking things painstakingly in photoshop or other based primarily on visions in your head), then you are basically putting your faith in those who decided how a certain color etc. should be rendered on a screen ie color spaces, color balance and the like.
when i got my 5d things changed, there are no 'cheat' modes on this camera, you actually have to know what you are doing.
the camera has an internal buffer memory for rapid sequence photography (17 raws or 60 jpegs).
i've seen some great stuff from my students using pin-hole cameras.
ok...for a photojournalist, a sport phtographer, a reporter like for a "common user" a digital vs. film question simply makes no sense.
when working with raw images, this is rather sluggish on all but the very newest and most powerful pcs.
all this competition is really going to benefit everybody here.
digital cameras and the digital workflow have made creating or capturing a great image much easier and much more likely for novice and amateur photographers (i admit i am one of these people however i have a "moral code" regarding the level of digital adjustments i will make).
(i flew the jet ranger helicopter on the left for three hours while commander chuck street reported the traffic and talked me through the occasional confined or pinnacle approach; i did not fly the helicopter on the right, which is a static display at the titan missile museum near tucson, arizona.)featured merchants text and pictures copyright 2005-6 philip greenspun.
the canon always looks to me like reduced, i guess it is the color palette, or the cmos sensors.
i suggest mr. greenspun do a little more research before making completely invalid statements which mislead camera buyers and uniformed photographers.
