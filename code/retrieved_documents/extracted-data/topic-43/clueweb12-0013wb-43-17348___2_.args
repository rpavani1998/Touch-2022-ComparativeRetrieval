on a recent trip to norfolk, i forgot to take a camera battery charger and so after my trustynikon d300 ran down i was forced to resort to my vintage (well, 2005)nikon d50 as backup.individual national bodies are also permitted to sell iso standards and this money is used to fund their own national standards activities, e.g., pay for offices and executive staff in their capital.the d50, in contrast, seems to produce punchier, vidid (and not‑so‑serious images).at its best with cooler, softer, almost pastel‑like scenes – which it renders with a painterly subtlety.bling quotable note that everyone directly involved in the development of iso standards is a volunteer or funded by outside sponsors.of course, we must also consider the considerable expense of maintaining offices and executive staff in geneva.the editors, technical experts, etc., get none of this money.this weblog’s written content is governed by a creative commons licence.what you see below is straight out of the camera converted from raw to jpeg usingdxo optics pro and dxo user andy_f’s default settings (check out the forums to find andy’s excellent work on better colour accuracy from raw conversions).follow me on twitter recentcomments comment rss - pathology (8) murata wrote: you once said that every thing became easy after t...[more] - pathology (8) ctrambler wrote: sorry for missing you in the hospital.comments are closed powered by blogengine.when it comes to attempting warmth, it seems to me to to veer off course and crash into a citrus palette.on be...[more] - going under the knife (4) front load washer wrote: it's actually a great and helpful piece of info.hmm, the nikon d800 high iso samples look greathttp://t.co/dqzddwl8 february 10.gareth [more] - pathology (8) tug wrote: that's really excellent news for you and the famil...
