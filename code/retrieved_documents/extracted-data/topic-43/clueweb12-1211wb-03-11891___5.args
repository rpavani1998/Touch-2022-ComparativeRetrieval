posts: 1,214 think that will be the one i get, are you aware of a new model coming out as i'd prefer to pay a bit less if a next generation appears on the scene.
pick up a nice, cheap minolta 50mm prime lens and you'll get some great low light shots.
imo i use a sony a200 and love it.
i did read the other day sony's have a stupid big dynamic range on their chips, like bigger than film and my 5d ii !
