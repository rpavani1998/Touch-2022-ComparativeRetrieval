all of theautofocus nikon wide angle primes are f/2.8, except for the mediocre35mm f/2d.
electronics can only do so much to reduce noise, and optical laws favor full-frame as modern optical designs come into play (eg canon) with improved corner performance.
resolution the 16.7-megapixel canon eos 1ds mark ii beats the nikon d2x—not by a lot, but it’s neverless sharp.
so far, it looks very promising.
while absolute resolution is always a big plus, a fine print requires high quality pixels, not just high resolution.
when the 1d mark iii becomes available, i’ll switch to the combination of 1d mark iii + 5d-ir, and sell the unmodified color eos 5d. contact me in late june 2007 if interested in the unmodified canon 5d. to be clear, nikon’s offerings at the low and medium end are excellent (if you can call cameras from $500 to $1600 “low end”).
dslr leadership might well change in 2010, but nikon’s offerings are top of the heap as i write this, with canon clearly lagging.
the17-55 f/2.8 dx and 28-70 f/2.8 af-s are both outstanding, but they are bulky and heavy and only f/2.8.
but i’m tired of waiting—if it’s this month at photokina, that won’t be too late, but beyond that nikon gets punted to my shit-list.
the35mm f/1.4l is outperformed by zooms in the corners, though otherwise excellent.
the 12.8-megapixel canon eos 5d beats the nikond200 (though not the d2x) —with higher contrast too.
nikon is at great risk of becoming a has-been in the professional market, a sad development, and one that is equally bad for canon users; canon needs a wolf nipping at its heels, as does nikon.
pushing the envelope of both resolution and features, along with outstanding new optics, canon is the new horse i’ll be riding with the arrival of my on-ordercanon eos 1d mark iii, while looking forward to a 22-megapixel (rumored) canon eos 1ds mark iii.
canon’s 135mm f/2l is optically outstanding, and it autofocuses accurately and instantly, quite unlike nikon’s dated and clunky135mm f/2 dc, which has specially-bred chipmunks living inside to turn the focusing mechanism.
the nikon d200 doesn’t just compare favorably to the canon 5d, it surpasses it in build quality, having a sealed body, larger and easier to use buttons and other positive characteristics (seed2x vs eos and d200 vs d2x).
so far, it looks very promising.
by comparison, canon has produced an improved 85mm f/1.2l ii, and an all-new 50mm f/1.2l; these two are uniquely “fast” and optically stellar.
the d2x uses a measly 43% of the area of a full-frame sensor; a full-frame camera with d2x resolution would be around 28 megapixels.
the17-55 f/2.8 dx and 28-70 f/2.8 af-s are both outstanding, but they are bulky and heavy and only f/2.8.
electronics can only do so much to reduce noise, and optical laws favor full-frame as modern optical designs come into play (eg canon) with improved corner performance.
another $125 is no big deal if you’ve bought a d2x, but if you’ve gone with the $500 d40, then another $125 is a very stiff premium indeed.
a february 2007 experience with an outdoor portrait reminded me how awful the results can be, but the conditions which cause it elude me.
the d200 viewfinder offers an excellent viewfinder for a “dx” camera, but i’ve come around to the view of many—ilike the full-frame view of the canon eos models (for most subjects at least).
with its “live view” feature, achieving critical focus for static subjects offers an unprecedented ability to squeeze every bit of resolution out of the system, especially at wide apertures.
the d200 seems better, but i’ve concluded that canon focus is simply more accurate (note: i haven’t proven this with objective testing, so it’s only my working theory).

ts need improvement (and flare badly in infrared).
the 16.7-megapixel canon eos 1ds mark ii beats the nikon d2x—not by a lot, but it’s neverless sharp.
canon offers an image stabilized 24-105l. nikon offers only consumer-grade stabilized lenses in that range.
with its “live view” feature, achieving critical focus for static subjects offers an unprecedented ability to squeeze every bit of resolution out of the system, especially at wide apertures.
in short, nikon is extremely competitive in the sub-$2000 range, and there is currently no rational reason for a photographer looking at that class of camera to be disappointed in any way with nikon.
so “switching” to canon really just means divesting myself of nikon equipment i’m unlikely to use, while keeping items that would prove useful should nikon’s offerings become more appealing—a camera is a tool
the35mm f/1.4l is outperformed by zooms in the corners, though otherwise excellent.
focus accuracy problems with the nikon d2x have cost me not just photos but considerable time re-shooting.
the combination of sensor resolution/photosite size and optical performance is what counts.
nikon is at great risk of becoming a has-been in the professional market, a sad development, and one that is equally bad for canon users; canon needs a wolf nipping at its heels, as does nikon.
but nikon seems to be on a consumer-driven mission, whereas canon is innovating with the apparent aim to dominate the professional market.
i still use nikon capture 4.4, which nikon has not offered as a universal binary.
canon claims true 14-bit color depth and unprecedented low noise.
simple—i didn’t feel like lugging my 5d-ir for shooting infraredand a nikon d200 kit for shooting color on my trips to death valley national park
the only relatively new nikon non-telephoto prime that i’m aware of is the85mm f/2.8d pc-micro-nikkor (a superb lens which i regularly use on my eos 5d with anadapter).
but nikon is failing to innovate at canon’ rapid pace, or at least in the waysi want them to innovate .

all professional digital cameras shipped today having 8 megapixels or more often out-resolve many lenses, especially at wider apertures or at the corners/edges.
to add insult to injury, the fast primes aremanual focus (58mm f/1.2 noct-nikkor, 50mm f/1.2 ais, 35mm f/1.4 ais, 28 f/2 ais,24 f/2 ais)—and some are not even available new anymore, or very hard to obtain.
canon does have some holes in its lens lineup; the stellar 200mm f/1.8l should be resurrected, the24mm f/1.4l is marginal, and a 28mm f/1.4 is needed.
the d2x uses a measly 43% of the area of a full-frame sensor; a full-frame camera with d2x resolution would be around 28 megapixels.
the 12-24 f/4 dx is a decent lens, but after 4 samples with optical problems, and with a slow f/4 aperture, it sits in my drawer.

a camera manufacturer that doesn’taggressively improve the optical performance of its lens line has little to offer with a higher resolution camera body.
full-frame isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, but nikon has nowhere to go from the d2x resolution which is already far too demanding of optical quality.
with the late-february announcement of the new canon eos 1d mark iii , the comparison seems very unfavorable for nikon’s d2x and even worse for the d2h.
owning both canon and nikon systems, it’s not like i can’t shoot both—except that carrying two systems gets tedious and heavy: two chargers, two extra batteries, two lens systems and at least two bodies.
canon offers an image stabilized 24-105l. nikon offers only consumer-grade stabilized lenses in that range.

one can also hope for improved color rendering with the 1d mark iii—i’ll be assessing that carefully.
the game has changed for resolution.

nikon’s prime-lens designs are dated, not using ed glass and aspherics adequately or at all, and optically mediocre for today’s digital cameras.
nikon charges $125 for capture nx (about $125 street price).
the nikon d40, d40x, d50, d80 are excellent cameras, ergonomically superior in multiple ways to the equivalent canon offerings.
on paper the eos 1d mark iii looks like an incredible camera, and i have one on order.
but at twice the price (originally $3300 vs $1600) and now still 70% more, the d200 is clearly afar better value.

the100-400 f/3.5-5.6l is an annoying push/pull design with good but not great optical performance—clearly inferior to nikon’s200-400 f/4 vr, though likely as good as the awkward nikon 80-400 vr.
the 12-24 f/4 dx is a decent lens, but after 4 samples with optical problems, and with a slow f/4 aperture, it sits in my drawer.
the 5d offers a larger viewfinder and higher resolution which for many users is the deciding factor.
disappointing 5d i prize my converted canon eos 5d-ir for infrared use.
my nikon 50mm f/1.4d is excellent optically, but plastic build and not even af-s. the50 f/1.8d is mediocre optically
canon claims true 14-bit color depth and unprecedented low noise.
i’ll be surprised if canon doesn’t offer an all-new fast 24mm or 28mm lens soon.
while absolute resolution is always a big plus, a fine print requires high quality pixels, not just high resolution.
a $1599, the50mm f/1.2l will never be a hot seller, and perhaps not even profitable, so canon deserves kudos for spending the r&d money and building such a unique lens.

the 12.8-megapixel canon eos 5d beats the nikond200 (though not the d2x) —with higher contrast too.
but the 5d color rendering (stock camera) can be awful; i’m not talking about the usual canon color “look” which nikon shooters are apt to dislike, but rather the tendency of the 5d to produce difficult-to-correct color shifts (see d2x vs eos), or to destroy certain colors, a fact i re-experienced with pale green reindeer lichen innorway last fall (examples discarded out of disgust—sorry).multiple disappointing color experiences with the 5d have caused me to conclude that while infrequent, the #1 weakness of the 5d is its color rendering.
