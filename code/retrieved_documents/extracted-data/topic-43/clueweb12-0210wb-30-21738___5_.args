like the d300, the d300s provides a full range of tools to fine-tune colour reproduction in difficult lighting conditions.this is equivalent to an 11x zoom range and the angle-of-view coverage suggests this lens is meant as an all-round choice for photographers who want just one lens for the camera body.as well as giving users the option to choose the type of memory card they prefer, the additional card slot provides greater shooting flexibility and convenience.this feature is handy for shooting wildlife and taking pictures in situations where shutter noise would otherwise be intrusive.however, when subjects were stationary or very slow moving, images were sharp and detailed enough to provide satisfactory footage for display on a widescreen tv set.video performance was similar to the d90 and d5000 and, as with these cameras, the smoothest, cleanest footage came from clips recorded in tripod mode with the camera mounted on a sturdy tripod.use of an external microphone minimises the chance of recording sounds produces by lens movements during autofocusing and when the vr mechanism is operating.the test camera produced even flash exposures at all iso settings and was capable of illuminating an average-sized room at iso 200.all internal processing in the chip is handled in full 16-bit colour, which provides better tonal reproduction, improved colour fidelity and faster image processing.nikon claims users can shoot with shutter speeds roughly four f-stops lower than they could with an unstabilised lens.focal length maximum aperture minimum aperture 18mm f/3.5 f/20 24mm f/3.8 f/22 35mm f/4.2 f/25 50mm f/4.8 f/29 70mm f/5.0 f/29 135mm f/5.6 f/32 200mm f/5.6 f/36 on test, this lens was found to suffer from noticeable barrel distortion at the 18mm focal length setting.the large, bright viewfinder carries over from the d300 and, despite claims of â€˜100% frame coverage' it still doesn't quite show the full image as it is captured.as in previous nikon dslrs that support movie capture, video is recorded in the avi/motion jpeg format, which is less efficient than the avchd and h.264 formats supported by other digital still cameras.in handheld mode, the camera sets apertures and shutter speeds automatically in response to changes in subject brightness.it uses colour and brightness data from the 1,005-pixel rgb sensor to identify different scene types and will adjust camera settings accordingly in full-auto mode.
