i just wish printing photographs was more simple now as i find the machines at camera printing shops either crop one’s photo on their own accord and just seem too problematic.
my area of interest is the pro dslr segment where nikon and canon are constantly leap-frogging each other.
reply i have been using a nikon product for the past 32 years and recommend nikon to anyone out there looking for a camera.
this article is a rehash of the one in beste product (dutch) and peta pixel.
the superiority of the back up and after sales service of nikon brand is more than a compelling reason to buy a nikon product!reply i like the canon because it is user friendly, easy to use and takes great picturesreply both cameras are great,love them,i own a nikon p100 and a canon slr 1000d,but find the canon more user friendly and that for me is a positive.
total sales figures do not say much as the camera market is segmentised.
that is the question » tags: camera face off, camera test, canon, nikon, photography i have a canon 1000d,for me its always been canon,ease of use,that’s it nothing else needs to be said,i love my canon and would never consider upgrading.
i am currently using a canon 60d and am very happy with the quality of the pics even with the kit lense.
hardly ever have to delete a photo.
while it seems readers favour nikon, it’s hard to tell which one is actually the best.
afterwards all i did was taking it apart and left it in the sun for a few hours to dry out!

i also echo the comments about nikon & lenses- my boss has a very old 400mm lens which has no af & no gearing fits my trusty old d70.
although it is quite old now and ‘only’ has 6 megapixels, the sensor is something special with great colours and low noise for its age.
i always used a nikon, i very good nikon camera’s, however i finally bought a canon, and am thrilled with it.
according to the facts and figures they are both very similar …..
it gets even more difficult because canon also make copier and printers which are often included in sales figures.
a year later, i acquired the magnificent d300s.
i would dlike to get back into my photography.

it does not matter, nikon or canon, pretty much the same thing.
i have a d50 with a telephoto lense and a 3100.reply funny enough, when i started looking at buying a dslr, canon was always on my mind.
looking forward to my lense upgrade.

reply check out the new nikon head office in midrand (interactive 360 degree photo): http://www.360cities.net/profile/johngore/image/nikon-head-office-south-africareply please will give me some info on a nikon.
reply i switched from pentax to canon twenty years ago.
i am happy with canon.
ok – they are the two largest, but there are other competitors, too!
my last camera plus all equipment was stolen.
i enjoy micro photography and animals (pets).
however, on average nikon is the most popular.
i sometimes miss the days of handing in one’s negatives… (and i am not old).
if you don’t have a favourite, look at what each company is offering at the time of you investing in equipment.
i change in brand will therefore be a huge cost.
it has a special affinity for the 80-400vr lens and also works very well with the 18-200vr.
reply thanks for that information.
there is not much between the two brands, as the experts believe that both cameras are deservedly good at an average of 8.7 for canon and 8.6 for nikon.
for example, value for money, compatibility, flexibility and what you are personally used to.
by the way as a novice which model of either should i buy?reply
canon and nikon are both multi-billion dollar optical companies that have been making some of the finest optics for consumers, military and industrial applications for decades.
it is also important for those that do compare the 2 brands to make sure that they compare cameras that are on the same level otherwise the results will be misleading.
i love the comment by carel above.
the results have been tallied and here are the findings.
i also find the colour saturation better with nikon & it reproduces black with less ‘blocking’.
it really does come down to personal preferences.
in looking at reviews and calculating an average score out of 10 points between 2006 and 2011, this is what they rated.
an important thing to realize is that both are proprietary systems, and once you have a few bodies and lenses with one brand, you are “stuck” with that brand.
i am investing in a camera soon.

any other make…reply the facts and figures agree: the answer to which camera to buy, should read canon or nikon.
not such a bad thing imho, as both are pretty much on par quality, lenses, etc.
i was very disappointed and must admit after all this time my i am thinking of trying canon.
i don't see what all the fuss is about.
either a canon or and nikon” …both are excellent.
right/enough  wildlife..." outrage at mec over chapman’s peak toll plaza "
after all is said and done, it really is hard to pick a clear winner: the two brands are technically as good as one other and the determining factor comes down to personal taste.
but nikon has now my preference…reply nikon!!
there is a ready second hand market for canon products so it is easy to progressively trade up.
i know canon are good cameras (i sometimes use my brother’s 550d, which is a great camera and nearly bought a 60d last year)
ended up getting the fuji finepix s5.
but what do the experts say?
reply my father’s nikon fm from 1982 is fully compatible with my new lenses and his 1982 lenses are still compatible with my new nikon.
reply i use a nikon d90 for my wildlife photography, but when it comes to point and shoot little carry arounf cameras i much prefer canon.
i then looked into fuji (photo club peer pressure).
these two dominate the photographic world.
i was blown away and have never looked back since.
you need to go to the d90/d7000 to get a real upgrade,reply
its up to the photograper ….reply i wholeheartedly agree with the comments stating that both brands are great- they are and are global market leaders.
it’s so lovely to sit with photographs in an album instead of a computer
reply i must admit, i love my nikon.
i am now on a 3100 and just love it.
reply i bought a nikon d50 in 2006 and take it with me on all our hiking trips.
what is better bmw or merc (lets not even go there ).
reply i love my canadian canon digital model – 3 inch screen and takes the most wonderful pictures (with me behind the shutter that is!)reply i have a canon and i love it …..
reply i fully agree with john gore, both brands are great and it’s all about personal choice.
nice having a boss who shares your passion for photography (and their lenses!)

i am still taking beautiful pictures, (maybe a proffesional will tell me that i do have a low standard?)
i took it in to be repared 4 times and they never found the problem.
some claim nikon has better lenses, but they are more expensive, but i think a more accurate statement would be that canon covers a wider range of lenses, therefore some canon users choose to buy the cheaper options, but they have lenses just as good as the nikon ones.
mine being nikon because for me, i like the way they handle.
canon has better sales purely because they market wider.
nikon has my heart, and mind.
nikon’s camera’s seemed to be a lot slower, perhaps they gave more options to edit where the canon’s quality is simply in image and their product and they allow the user to edit on the computer.
i know that when i can afford to upgrade to one of the models in the d3/ d300 range, my lenses & theirs(!) will fit.
“which camera should you buy?
but i really battle to face trying to get them off the disk and deal with those machines…reply seems like only 7% know their stuff.
great informative review too.
easy usability and final results are never dissapointing.
personal opinion- of course!
the only problem is, as mentioned here below, i will have to replace all my lenses and that becomes costly…….
my next body will be nikon as i believe they have better colour definition and dynamic range.
definition is fantastic.
since my first camera almost 30 years ago i have always and only used nikon and have alway believed in nikon.
nikon has just released the d4 and d800 which trump the 1dmkiv and 5dmkii but canon has the new 1dx and will soon have the eagerly expected 5dii replacement.

they compete so heavily against each other in the same market that if one really were the best, the other would have gone out of business long ago.
my thanks, sally why just look at these two brands?
recently we asked our readers whether they preferred to use a nikon or a canon.
kept on replacing a part and kept on saying it was in perfect condition, but my old d50 still takes better pictures.
although it’s close, nikon is the users’ favourite.
"the 3d  rendering doesn't look that bad.
my best friend can use my lenses on his d200…
nikon gives a free high quality photography course when you buy one of their cameras.
will also need photo software.
i once fell off a 6m high bridge (which broke underneath me) into a river with my nikon hanging around my neck.
the other reason is nikon’s business is cameras and lenses thats all they have been making since the beginning… so they focus only on making the best even better!!!reply i think that the photographer gets locked in a brand, the day he/she decides to do photography, the lenses are expensive.
it fell a few times accidentally i had to clear the lenses due to dust on it maybe i am just very lucky ‘touch wood’.
i have only ever used nikon, but i’m sure canon is pretty great.
i still have my slr for film and would love to sell it even though it is in perfect condition.
sony pentax olympus panasonic sigma… you should try to be more inclusive the next time!reply i only use nikon and the reason for this is i can take any nikon lense from any year and it will fit my camera!
i love the fact that i get to fit any one of the lenses on my camera body, even 10 years from now.
the d50 is a very special camera.
however, two years ago i bought a d90 and ever since have had problems.
nikon may lead canon sales in one area and vice versa in another.
i have tried to replace it with both d40x and d60, but have ended up selling them and keeping the d50.
the next day i took photo’s again, although the first few had a cloudy look (filter look) but since then nothing wrong.
i did all the research of equivalent models and came up with nikon suiting my purposes better.
when my pentax died i was looking at replacing it with canon (brother-in-law influence).
why do you prefer one over the other?
lenses i bought then still fit my current 5d and 5d mark ii.
and there are lots of specials on these two brands.
these companies tend to merely leapfrog one another in terms of who comes out top at the end of each year.
canon is the clear winner in the sales category, but while the massive sales volume tips the scales in its favour, it has no effect on camera users’ opinion on both brands, with nikon only just ekeing out a win in the popularity contest.

it really is a merc/audi/bmw scenario.
evidences the power of great marketingreply in south africa, the level, standard and professionalism of after sales customer service far exceeds that of canon.. just read the comments for both manufacturers on “hello peter.com”
nikon lens technology is great but canon image sensor technology is better (imho).
experts and users reviewed canon and nikon dslrs worldwide.
long term i bet on canon because of its market dominance and hence its larger r&d budget.
however, the day i got money in my hands, i bought a nikon d60 and just loved it.
nikon is much more aggressive in its marketing approach in sa than canon.
this will allow you to make the best decision that suits you.
it uses the nikon d200 body with fuji insides, and all nikon lenses fit.
