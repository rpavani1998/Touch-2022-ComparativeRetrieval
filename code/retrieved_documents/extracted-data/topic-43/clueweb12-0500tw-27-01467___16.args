mitch not only hdmi out from the 800d but also uncompressed full 1080p from the hdmi.
mar, 2012 except things already mentioned above, there is also an ethernet port available on d800.
we thought about throwing in the canon eos-1d x and the nikon d4, but those are approximately $3,000 more so they’re in a different class.
both cameras appear to be fantastic and we are all winners.
i’m absolutely convinced in both, just d800 fits better for me and seems to be better value for the money.
mar, 2012 i think we have the winner, nikon has better hand in the competition.
mar, 2012 mitch the d800 also has horizon level, aperture control in video , uncompressed hdmi out, also on timelalse it edits the images and outputs a final video.

yes metering: ttl exposure metering using 91k (91,000)-pixel rgb sensor memory cards: sd (secure digital) and ; type i compactflash memory cards (udma compliant) battery: li-ion en-el15 battery horizon level: dual axis levelling well-loved.
mar, 2012 do not worry mitch, i also blief that you are a canon shutter so there is a chance you will look more for the canon information.
i have invested “a coin or two” in canon glass, but that is no issue at all – i’m going to sell them all with basically no loss and buy equivalent nikon alternatives.
shame on this website for blowing chunks though.
congrats on what seems to be large megapixels opening up new super print option.
i really like the sound of the pixel based metering of d800, time-lapse support, higher pixel count, built-in flash (for fill) water-resistance, and potential to use an f4 lens with 2x and still get af.

also on the battery grip you right extra on the d800 and on the canons you wright the model names, or write extra on all or write model names on all.
ps: nobody is really locked in platform.

i apologize for making the errors… it has been an awful long week.

a few more - autofocus points: 51 points, 9 at f/8 - video recording format: h.264/mpeg-4 avc - battery grip: mb-d12 optional - battery: en-el15 other factors that could be included is the: - price - wb bracketing - connectivity, i.e. usb and any thing else that could be added.

mar, 2012 i have been a pro canon user since the f1n and loved the gear as del as the cps support.
mar, 2012 by planetmitch in 5d mk ii, 5d3, d800 one of the first things people start doing when a new camera like the canon eos 5d mark iii is announced is compare it to other cameras in its class… so we knew you’d want that

both 5d mk iii & d800 are fantastic cameras, they both excel at some features and lack at others – thus providing specific needs of specific market segments.
yes when you compare some cameras maybe you want to give an extra 5 to 10 minutes to get the specs from the manufacturer.
also on the battery grip you right extra on the d800 and on the canons you wright the model names, or write extra on all or write model names on all.
mar, 2012 d800 also has in-camera hdr, ae lock and a self cleaning sensor.
mar, 2012 hey mitch, excellent job.
please fix this because your blog give out an inacurate image.
i’m canon shooter converting to nikon, but that does not take away excellent quality of either.
mar, 2012 d800 has multible exposures up to 9 and hdr mode, get your info right well-loved.

mar, 2012 correct me if i am wrong but i believe the d4 has the ethernet port but the d800 doesn’t.
thanks for your work so far mitch.

this alone help me to make a change, moving to sony or nikon, may be a fs100 that i can get a adapter or just sell all fo my canon lenses and move to kikon, because of the size of the sensor i belief i am moving to nikon and just them after a fs100 replacement go back to video cameras.
nonetheless, both cameras are excellent.
absolutely no doubts 5dmk3 will take amazing pictures, just the same applies to d800
usb 3 also seems like a great idea, shame my mac doesn’t offer it too.
no need to apologize to lazy a55 jerks who cannot do anything other then crib like little 8itches and pick on some small errors.

love the low light options, speed that it offers.

the 14-24mm lens and 24-120 cover most options for me as a photo-journalist.

absolutely no doubts 5dmk3 will take amazing pictures, just the same applies to d800 (maybe save for iso12800 which might be better on canon due to pixel size but that doesn’t bother me at all as i rarely see iso1600).
