am disappointed with the quality of the digital zoom.
very happy with the p7000.
i'm not entirely happy with the zoom, i thought it was a little longer range, but the indoor photos are great and so is the close up feature.
this is easily overcome by fine tuning the white balance, but it's still an extra step that might cause you to miss a good shot.
i also have a nikon d40x that i have been using for quite some time and was wanting a backup camera to carry in my bag.

my previous 'travel' camera was the sigma dp1 (phenomenal sensor/image quality), which is great in its own right but the p7000 goes a step further in overall usefulness.

only complaint i can muster is the viewfinder, but the lcd does a good job

dslr's are too bulky to haul around and lcd screens tend to wash out in bright light.
for me, although i am a nikon guy, i held out to the bitter end and at one point even considered purchasing a g12, until the price drop and the firmware update.

in fact, my last trip to the philippines i brought this along instead of one my slrs.
