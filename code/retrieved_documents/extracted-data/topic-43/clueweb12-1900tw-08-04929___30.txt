reply hi nassim, i love your work and photography tips.
i personally shoot the 50mm  lenses at near maximum aperture to get a shallow depth of field, so the  improved performance at wide apertures is very important for me.
the new 50mm f/1.4g  lens has 9 rounded blades, producing a much more pleasant round-shapedbokeh.
hi mr. nasim, your post is very informative..
really love your pictures and your careful review.
i would like to use it for portraits, pictures of my friends, random awesome objects i see in my day to day activities and to a lesser extent band photography.
the only key difference worth noting is that the  new 50mm af-s lens has a larger barrel compared to the old 50mm lens.
remember, i came to this conclusion not because i own any of these lenses, but because i’ve read hundreds of reviews, opinions, and articles on them.
i’m currently using 50mm 1.8 af-d and looking to get maybe 1.4 version.
however, i think would like to go for a prime lens as to get a better indoor portrait of my baby.
reply hi nasim, finally i got my af-s 50mm 1.4g. amazing results.
you answered a question i had.
here are the reasons i chose this one as my first prime lens: 1.
reply thanks nasim for this interesting article,, so if you don’t mind, i’m thinking to get d7000 body with some lenses that i want to share it with you, to see your opinion about it as i’m not that expert: so what’s the three lenses from the list below you pick if you’re in my situation?
yes, go for the nikon 50mm 1.4g and you won’t be disappointed :)
thanks nasim for nice articles and lens comparison.
i know i gain some speed but the 60mm is a pretty sharp lens, and i wouldn’t be gaining much if i was looking at the 50mm 1.8 which you and others recommend over the 1.4.
i’m hoping to test the 16-85mm within the next several weeks, so stay tuned :)
i have a d300, d700 and d3s and found that this lens performs flawlessly on all nikon bodies.
but i also, prefer one that does well in low light situations.
since af-d lenses are usually cheaper compared to the equivalent af-s lens, what would be your general recommendation for someone considering between buying a cheaper af-d lens vs paying more for a af-s lens to get better image quality?
reply mahmood, thanks for stopping by and dropping a comment!
i have 2 questions: 1) i am thinking of getting the 50mm f/1.4, either the af-s vs the af-d. considering the price and iq difference, which would you recommend?
hi nasim, for a nikon fx (d800 almost here!) is it worthwhile going to a 50mm prime if i have the 60mm 2.8 d micro?
do you have any experience with the nikon 16-85mm f/3.5-5.6 vrii?
i went to a camera store the other day but the sales guy suggested to me the sigma 50mm
anyway, i have a question i think you might be able to help with.
if you want to use auto focus, you must buy an af-s, because the d40 haven’t micromotors on body to do focus.
upgrade now or later when i get my fx.reply eric, upgrade later when you get fx – the nikon 35mm f/1.8g is a great lens for dx.reply thank you for your article, i really love it.
reply thank you for this article, it answered all my questions about upgrading.
the 35mm lens is very inexpensive and delivers superb image quality on a dx body.
i’m still pondering over these few models: a) af-s nikkor 35mm f/1.4g – latest, probably be darn expensive … or could cause other primes price drop b)
i don’t want to spend $$ for the nikon 17-55 2.8.
can you clarify and help?
so in your opinion what would you prefer on d90 50mm f/1.4g or 35mm f/1.8g ?
do you even recommend it with a d7000 ?
however, do you think that the 16-85 (with a 35mm f/1.8 down the road) or the tamron 17-50 (w/constant 2.8 aperture and a vc) would be a better choice?
very sharp and contrasty, good bokeh (not as beautiful as the 1.4d obviously).reply hi mr nasim, first of all, your site is truly magnificent for a newbie photographer like me.
i hope that you can help me on this.
f/1.4g or af nikkor 50mm f/1.4d 3) af-s nikkor 24-70mm f/2.8g ed 4) af-s vr zoom-nikkor70-300mm f/4.5-5.6g
i already sent it for calibration it still back focuses on the other af point are you using also a d90?reply marvin, the center focus point is always going to be more accurate than others, but you should not get a backfocus with all other focus points.
reply bruno, sorry for a late response – get the 58mm b+w filter for the lens and you will not be disappointed.
i read almost all your lens review.
the nikon 50mm f/1.4g is newer and certainly sharper than the 50mm f/1.4d, especially when shooting at maximum aperture.
nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 vri #
do you think the same?
thanks brian brian, those lenses are good for portraiture and reach (wildlife, etc), but not for wide-angle photography.
hey nasim, what do you think of the 50mm 1.8d for food photography?
it gave me so many great pictures and i still use it quite a bit on our d300 body.
she loves the fact that the lens is  very compact, light and yet produces stunningly beautiful images.
reply nasim and shalom, i owned both nikon 35mm f/1.8g and nikon 50mm f/1.4g on my d90.
buying 35mm f/1.8g is not an option for me, at-least now :(.reply mujahid, it would be tough to get 100% accurate focus at maximum apertures due to shallow depth of field.
any comments/feedback on this camera?
dose it work with full frame cameras i mean with d700?!
also great sunset panorama, would you mind explaining the settings and filters you used?
in terms of getting a portrait lens, the 50mm f/1.4g is excellent and my favorite of the group, but it might feel a little too long on a dx camera like d90.
she heavily uses this lens for wedding and other event photography as well.
do you have any suggestions or recommendations for manual focusing practice?
i use it for about 80% of my shooting (as my walking around lens) except for the 20% times i need longer reach where i use the 55-200mm.
p.s. also like to take family pictures……reply tom, if you are shooting headshots or half body shots, the nikon 50mm f/1.4 is ideal, even on dx.
hence you would need af-s with built in motor in the lens itself.
you are most welcome!reply hey nasim!!
i also have the 50mm 1.8, 85mm 1.8, and a sigma 70-300 f/4-5.6 apo dg macro.
to be honest, im truly zero in dslr.
of course the 50f1.4 price is higher than 35f1.8.
sigma zoom master 35-70mm af-s 3.5-5.6f and a nikkor 50mmaf-s 1.8d so far great pictures no regrets.
although  the focus speed is slightly slower when compared to theolder 50mm af-d lens,  there are many more benefits to the new 50mm lens, including increased  sharpness and better bokeh.
reply thanks for the reply.
reply i have one lingering question that i thought i might be able to get a clear answer to just by researching on the internet but haven’t so far.
i considered the nikon 18-105 vri, nikon 16-85 vrii, nikon 18-200 vrii, sigma 17-70 2.8-4 os, and tamron 17-50 2.8 vc.
is the f aperture a linear or exponential scale?
can the camera override the manual aperture setting on the lens ring?
in my experience, the sensor will collect dust eventually after years of use anyway, and a advanced amateur photographer has to have the tools and know-how to clean the dust by his own.
reply hi nasim with your advice, i bought a d90 and loving it totally.
so my question is, do i gain anything significant by opting for the nikon 16-85 or the tamron, or i’ll be just fine with the 18-105 kit lens?
when i tested both cameras to focus from infinity to a nearby object,  it was very clear that the newer lens acquires focus slower than the older  version.
bokeh (background blur): the older f/1.4d lens has 7 straight blades in  its diaphragm, which results in aheptagon-shaped bokeh.
thanks, dave name * email * website notify me of followup comments via e-mail notify me of new posts by email.
no, there is no 35mm f/1.4g yet…hopefully later this year.
it is one of the sharpest ultra-wide angle lenses nikon has made.
i have bookmarked your site for future articles.
hi nasim, first of all, thank you for your wesite, it has been of great help for my photography :)
you have mention a few times about the 50mm 1.4 giving a barrel look.
i have a 50mm 1.4 af-d with a d90 most of the times it doesn’t focus accurately most of the time it backfocus…reply marvin, that’s very unfortunate.
d f1.4 d, however, although some photos are great, i’m also producing a lot of blurry ones too.
it is very very helpful.
you did the right thing.
can i ask why you need the 50mm or 60mm lenses?
here are the reasons why i went with the 16-85: 2 ed and 3 asp, compared to 1 ed and 1 asp in 18-105, much better build quality, metal mount, rubber dust gasket seal (it is important), vrii, sharper (particularly in the corners – very important for me), distance scale, less distortion & the extra 2mm.
otherwise, go for the 35mm or shorter focal length lenses.
i was expecting the new “af-s” version to  be faster, but unfortunately, it is actuallyslower than the  older lens.
i was trying to decide firstly between the 1.8 and 1.4 and then between the 1.4d and g, but you’ve definently steered me to the 1.4g. i primarily take newborn photography but also want to get some great outdoor portraits-i must say i’m in love with good bokeh
if you just need a lens for general photography, get the nikon 35mm f/1.8g.
maybe tomorrow i will buy it..
reply hi, im using a d60nikon..and i have a 55mm,1.4g len..
is this a good choice for all around photography?
i wanted to buy a 50mm portrait type of lens right now though.
in that regard, the 35mm f/1.8g is better, since you can fit a lot more into the frame.
you definitely do not want to buy the imported version – it is the same as a “grey market” version, which means it will come with no warranty of any kind.
the 50mm f/1.4 really stood out to me because of it’s large aperture and ability to take sharp pictures, but i’m torn as to whether i should get the older af-d or the new f/1.4g
but right now, just enjoying my d3 !
i’d like to ask for an advice, for my d90 camera which is better to buy for portraiture images?
thanx again nasim jeff, no worries, obi answered first :)
nice creamy and round.
thank you for this great article!reply hi nasim.
the reason i ask is that there seems to be rather large price differential between the 1.4 and 1.8reply asha, the 50mm f/1.8d lens will work great for food photography, as long as your camera has an autofocus motor.
many thanks, njreply nasim, what shooting mode do you use when using the 1.4?
yehuuuu… ;) guess what?
so this 38mm f/1.8 g is more suitable to my d90.
have you had any experience or may know what is causing this issue and how it can be fixed?
the nikon 50mm f/1.4g is a great lens that i use more than any other and it will serve you well for the type of photography you want to do… hope this helps.
i need some advice from you.
the barrel (not sure of the correct terminology) shakes.
those two reasons alone are worth the difference in pricing between the old 50mm and the new one.
i’m having trouble in low light situations getting the sharpness that i want.
thanks again obi jeff, why don’t you try b&h instead?
maybe next time i can have it with me.
what are the pros and cons of using the 50 and 85 with the 3x?
if budget is an issue, why don’t you get the nikon 35mm f/1.8g lens instead?
yes, i have also heard about low performance of the 16-35mm on the d3x, so i would not take the risk.
amolreply will this lens work on a d70?reply hello nasim, i just discovered your blog and i have to say, you have a passion for photography.
reply faizul, you are most welcome!
but i could actually take nice indoor close-ups without having to get too close to the people (got more natural poses) 3.
handling and weight: both lenses are very lightweight (new 290g, old 260g)  and are both great to handle.
you can order thru amazon if you are willing to wait for shipping.
i love the fact that there is an lcd screen on top of the camera…don’t know what i would do without it :)
i have a nikon d3100
i am thinking about upgrading to the f1.4 but unsure whether i will see a marked improvement in the photos between the f1.8 & f1.4.
anyway, great site – will be back more often!reply trissa, thank you for your feedback!
which of the optimus prime (hehehe) would you recommend?
please let me know if the nikon af-s 50mm f/1.4g will be best suited for d200.
,all i want to know is is it worth the $ 150 extra for 1.4 g when i have d90 in which autofocus will work for 1.4 d right?reply siju, sorry for a late response.
while you might get a slightly better performance with the two lenses separately, having to constantly change lenses is inconvenient and will add more dust to your sensor.
i have a nikon d200 and have the 50mm af-d lens right now.
i know that i won’t have the autofocus, but do you think it is a good option?
i find mine almost as good as the 50 1.4 your site is very interesting, well donereply daniel, the nikon 50mm f/1.8d is also good, but not as good as the f/1.4 when it comes to bokeh.
as far as general tips, have you seen my “photography tips for beginners” page?
i want to be able to use this lens for anything.
for now i need to study more on my d90 plus its kit for a moment and really love it so much.hehehehe thanks obi and nasimreply no problem jeff, enjoy your d90!reply i had a quick question for you.
if you have a large place to take pictures of your kid, go for the 50mm.
thanks zoran, that’s because you probably have it set to “single” mode and your autofocus is set to only shoot when your subject is in 100% focus.
im waiting for tomorrow… ;)reply harmanizan, i would take a serious look at the nikon d5000 with the nikon 35mm f/1.8g dx lens as a combo for your first dslr purchase.
reply nasim, first of all thanks for the great blog.
mike and i apologize for a late reply!
wochomi, i’m glad you like your d90 – it is a terrific camera and it looks like it won’t get updated until next year anyway, so you shouldn’t feel too bad about the d7000.
in response to zoran’s question, i also have sometimes trouble with auto focusing with 50mm 1.8g. i then try to focus on contrast area to set the focus there?reply hello nasim: this is the most complete article that i could found!!
oh ya, can u suggest me any articles or website that show a expressway/summary to use d90?
after that considering your reviews i want to buy a 16-35 vr which would be great with 50mm
thanks for the great site nasim!reply eric, congratulations!
is there anyway to overcome this?
regards raj raj, both lenses are comparable, but don’t forget that the 50mm is an f/1.4 lens, so you can get some really nice shots at very shallow depth of field.

am going though it now, thanks!reply thank you for your feedback sirisha!reply
but they say that lens has problems with high resolution of d3x.
reply thank you for the nice post and your replies for almost every response.
among the lenses i lost, was my prized 50mm f/1.2.
btw, i bought the 24-120mm f4 after reading your article.
do not worry about the difference – 50mm f/1.4d is still a beautiful lens.
however, if/when a time comes that i need to replace it i’ll go for the 1.4s after reading your review!
maybe i will compromise on speed on lens.
i have just started my business.
you got seriously nice pictures in here.
( is my current 105 enough for d7000?)
if you do, then your camera might be the problem…reply mr nasim, can you share your thoughts on other types of lens i.e. fish-eye len between dx and fx format.
it is a little expensive, but totally worth it.
i bought a kit lens although i know it’s not fantastic quality.
i am looking at purchasing a d7000 with nikkor af-s 50mm f1.4g and nikkor af-s vr ii 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6
do hope your advice for this lense….
i chanced upon your site by accident while searching for infos on 50mm f/1.4g. i need your advice.
here is the link for the rebates page with all current deals.
reply i just got the d90 with the 18-105 a week ago and yesterday ordered the 50mm/f1.8d (only $125).
is it the 50mm f/1.4g af-s or the 50mm f/1.4d?
i can’t seem to capture the orange and reds in the same mannor when taking sunset pictures.
can you give me advice between 50mm f/1, 8d and 50mm f/1.4d?
yes, 35mm f/1.8g is a great start!reply hi nasim, i am a novice at slrs and professional photography.
f1.4 3) final verdict and recommendations
af-s. could i get your opinion on this?
i personally found this a little annoying on the older  lens, because dust particles would occasionally get in between.
the vrii helps a lot with low shutter speeds.
1.4 d images are sharper and is a better lens than 1.4 g..it seems to be the sharpest among 50mm leans except for the bokey..is that true..which one do i but..as i am having d90 do u think 1.4 d will give me good resultsreply siju, where did you see in reviews that the 50mm f/1.4d is sharper than 50mm
manual, apeture priority or auto?
just not sure if i need the f1.4 or what?!
reply you didn’t miss out on anything.
i have ordered the nikon 50mm f/1.4g lens and want to buy a filter for it.
the price for 50mm/f1.4g or d was too high.
i was been searching a lot because i am interesting in buying one, i am a beginner photography’s student in mexico, i have the nikon d5000 and the classical 18-55 and a 55-200, but they are not enough i need better pics with the minimal light so that i need very lightly lens, i was hesitated between 1.4d and 1.4g. thanks!!
it is not heavily noticeable though and can be fixed in  post-production, if it becomes an issue.
d90 however does have it in the body.
optics and sharpness: optically, the new 50mm af-s lens has more elements  – 8 elements in 7 groups, compared to 7 elements in 6 groups in the older  lens.
having said that, i still need to decide on an all around zoom lens for convenience and flexibility.
my only concerns are color and contrast.
at f/2.8 and above, the lenses perform equally well, although the new 50mm tends to have slightly better corner sharpness all the way to f/5.6.
or micro af-s 60mm 2.8g ed.
would it be smarter to purchase the 35mm 1.8 or the 35 mm 1.4.
i’m kinda on a limited budget here.
they did this so it can’t be used on a manual focus camera.
sorry i mean af-d as you call it.
see mynikon 16-35mm f/4 review to see some test samples and conclusion.
so basically portraits and also photojournalistic types of photography eventually.
nasim, i bought it already on yesterday…
while i can now awaiting the lens.
the nikon d90 is a superb camera and i love it more than my nikon d300 :)
then, can u suggest me to get 1 more of another lense..?
so, one has to change lenses and go with a faster lens.
enjoy your 16-85mm, i’m sure it is a great lens!
after looked at most of your comments, i try to search for the price of those lenses that you recommended… the price quite a boom for me as a newbie in this field… the one that catched my eyes was spec.
what i would do, is try to shoot at f/2.8 and above and watch your focus through viewfinder while rotating the focus ring on the lens.
i want to take better portraiture pictures and after doing some research many suggested i get either
the only other lens i am looking at is tamron 17-50 f2.8 vc.
i have found the 85mm f/1.8 to be an excellent portrait lens (better than the 50mm f/1.8) and coupled with the 35mm f/1.8, it would provide me the capabilities of indoor low-light snapshots and group pictures (thus eliminating the need for a dedicated 50mm prime).
i just bought this 50mm f/1.4 g lens.
im still new to food photography,so i would like to know if you could share with me ,what is the best mode,iso,foucs,white balance,image quality to use on food for this camera..please email me.thanks so much.
thanks again from raleigh, nc.reply mahmood, considering that nikon is giving away $300 on the nikon d90 and 18-200mm vr ii lens combo, i would suggest getting the 18-200mm vr ii (it is a great value).
so what do you think?
i am an ameture photographer and have a d90 to work with.
great article and it was interesting to read all the comments following.
at the moment, i’m not too sure if it would be worth the upgrade or should i spend money for other fast lens like wide angle zoom or even mid range zoom like 24-70 2.8f.
the guy at a camera store told me which one but i cannot rememebr and he wanted to sell it to me for nearly 500$. i am hoping ot purchase on online for less money.
i personally rarely shoot it at f/1.4 and would suggest to shoot at f/2.0-f/4.0.
your camera d40 doesn’t have motor to auto focus your d lens.
i have recently purchased a nikon d3000 (mostly because it fit into my budget :-| ) and am smitten by its features and capabilities.
e.g. what if i am indoors and have set the lens ring at f1.8 and then go outdoors where i only need say f11, do i have to remember to do this on the lens aperture ring or can the camera manage it in the auto mode?
reply niko, the nikon 50mm f/1.4g works great on any modern nikon camera, including the nikon d200.reply with your great review, i already ordered the lens and it’s coming on my way later this afternoon…
bipinreply bipin, just noticed your comment.
i bought this lens a few days ago because of your articles that really makes me feel that is a good lens, but i don’t know about filters.. could you just simply show me which one do you use on your 50 1.4/g?
sunset panorama, captured with nikon d700 & nikon 50mm f/1.4d lens the nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s is also my wife’s most favorite lens that she uses for all of herfood photography.
but b&h says the lens you talk about above does not work on a d60 ( http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?o=product.jsp&a=getpage&q=nikonsilentwave.jsp ).. :?
so do not regret it…you have made the right choice and the nikon d90 will serve you well for a long time!reply same goes to me nasim..
i personally shoot the 50mm lenses at near maximum aperture to get a shallow depth of field, so the improved performance at wide apertures is very important for me.
let me know if you have any specific questions meanwhile…reply hi nasim, i just stumbled upon your website when i was looking for credible reviews comparing the nikon 50 f/1.4 afd versus the afs version, and i just wanted to say wow, great article.
you will not be disappointed with the 50mm f/1.4g, for sure :)
talking about 35 vs 50 i choose the 35mm because of the price, i have not used it to much yet because i really love the 70-300, lol, but i took some good pictures with this 35mm lens also especially in low-light situations best regards,reply jorge, congratulations, you bought great lenses!
do you think that it is valuable to buy 17-35 f2.8 than 17-35 f4 vr? st river, thank you for your valuable feedback.
please advice if you may have some suggestions.
i have the 50mm 1.8 and 85mm 1.8.
i can “sneaker zoom” the 50mm for the same range.
the nikon 50mm f/1.4g is an excellent lens.
2) would it be fair to generalize that af-s lenses will usually outperform af-d lenses?
so, as soon as the update came out, i pre-ordered one from b&h and started using it more than the older version for my everyday photography needs.
as for usa/imported versions, use this link for the 50mm version and this link for the 35mm version.
because of  this, you will find that keeping the new 50mm lens clean is easier than the old  one.
what are your thoughts on this?
best regards,reply jorge, i have written a review of the nikon 55-300mm lens earlier, so you can check out what i think there.
may i ask you one more help – what difference does ‘lens reproduction factor’ makes for lens performance especially on a dx format?
reply hi nasim, i would like to see a review between nikon 50mm f/1.4g vs zeiss 50mm f/1.4, very nice review i had g version and is much better than d.reply i’m using oldie 50mm e series f1.8, a nice…small and very ligth lens, but still had no chance to compare it with others like af-d or s f1.8.
you probably need to learn how to focus well with it.
so, is the new nikon 50mm f/1.4
i was very excited when the newnikon 50mm f/1.4g came out, because  i loved the older version and couldn’t imagine how good the new one would  be with all of the new enhancements that nikon has been adding to their line of  lenses.
reply harmanizan, congratulations with your purchase!
my main reason for a lens filter is to protect it, and i think most of my subjects with this lens is my grandsons…any suggestions?
so what lens should i get which will allow me to take photos with my d60 until i have the funds to buy a d90?
my email is tonieduchemin@gmail.comreply hi toni !
i guess that 35mm f/1.8g is more value for my learning curve.
i have a nikon d300 (the older version not the video one) and i have found that this lens is not only lacking it’s sharpness that you seem to achieve with many of your images but also the autofocus is off.
;) thanks for your advise..
yes, i would keep the 24mm f/1.4 – it is certainly nikon’s sharpest wide angle lens.
and this lens actually has less distortion than the supposed upgrade.
;) now, im trying to get info about d5000.
i find it much better than my nikon 24-70mm f/2.8g
it contains many basic articles for beginners.
reply sirisha, if you look at the link you provided once again, you will see that the camera listed is n60, not d60.reply
hopefully, i wouldn’t want to upgrade too soon to yet another lens.
-tia- muhd, thank you for stopping buy and leaving a comment.
i will have to decide sooner or later.
reply don, you are most welcome!
nasim i am usin a nikon d90…i am confused bw 50mm 1.4 g or 1.4 d….from the reviews came to know
i would certainly get the 24-70mm f/2.8g to go with the d3…i just came back from a short trip to yellowstone and i once again realized that it is my top pick for landscape photography.
i personally like and recommend both lenses a lot!reply hi nasim enjoy your site very much.
are you doing this indoors or outdoors in broad daylight?
have you tried sending your lens back to nikon for repair?reply mine back focuses when focused from other af points it is consistently more spot-on on the center focus is this due to the d90 having only 1 cross type af point in the center?
i have just received, as a very nice gift, a nikon d3x with the standard 24-70 2.8g ed lens.
it saves a lot of time for sure.
reply yeow, shooting the nikon 50mm f/1.4g @ f/1.4 can yield soft results due to a) shallow depth of field and b) improper focus.
pls advice siju siju, yes, the nikon 85mm f/1.8d is an excellent lens for portraiture.
i’ve bookmarked your site and will return regularly!reply thank you for your feedback nicolas, i’m glad you are enjoying that 50mm f/1.4g
i found portraits are diluted in contrast at f1.4 apertures.
hey i have been goin through the reviews of nikon 85mm 1.8d lens…found that this is one of the best in nikons,have u tried this out..it seems it is pretty sharp at almost any aperture..
i have a nikon d3000 with a nikon 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6g vr af-s dx, and i am about to buy 2 more lenses.
i am very sorry to hear that your camera gear got stolen… in terms of replacing your 50mm f/1.2, i think you should definitely give thenikon 50mm f/1.4g a try – the af is something you will definitely enjoy after working with a mf lens for a long time.
since then i’ve been happily taking pictures of my baby girl.
aperture ring: the new nikon 50mm f/1.4g is a “g” lens, and  therefore, has noaperture ring (the old one does).
i looked thru my 18-105 set at 35mm and 50mm, and 50mm did feel a little long
i was very excited when the newnikon 50mm f/1.4g came out, because i loved the older version and couldn’t imagine how good the new one would be with all of the new enhancements that nikon has been adding to their line of lenses.
so much i appreciate it.
is the lens perhaps damaged?
the 18-200 is an excellent lens for someone who wants the convenience of a larger zoom range with vrii, doesn’t want to change lenses and risk dust on the sensor.
:d jeanne/d7000/singaporereply nasim, i’m having a hard time trying to buy a simple uv filter for my 50 1.4/g .
thank you kindly, i appreciate your dedication regarding photography and reviews.
for  photographing my kids indoors that move non-stop, the new af-s version focused  almost as fast as the old one and i did not see any focus problems with it.
my obvious choice are the first two.
i like using the nikon f1.4d @
for food photography, there are plenty of different techniques.
g is slightly sharper than the older version, especially wide open (see samples  below).
reply harmanizan, the 18-105mm lens is a good general lens for wide-angle and medium telephoto work.
great difference in price and quality obviously.
in future, i will buy a wide lens for landscape.
i finally decided on the 16-85 vrii and i am happy i did.
your website is very nice, good luck with your photography! :)
f1.4 however at this aperture the center is soft.
and i’m not too well versed in these things yet.
thanks, lesliereply good day, thanx for the review!
i read thom’s review on the nikkor 50mm f1.4g
based on what u have writing before, its better to spend little bit more money then invest on d90 right?
my “wish list” of lenses includes… - nikkor 14-24mm 2.8 - nikkor 24-70mm 2.8 - nikkor 70-200
jeanne/singapore jeanne, i would not get a fisheye lens unless you have tried it and know that you need it.
it’ll be nice if you could give me an advice on which one to pick between 50mm f/1.4g af-s and 50mm f/1.4d af.
sorry for a late response.
sorry!reply sirisha, get the nikon 35mm f/1.8g or nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s – both will work with the nikon d60 and d90.reply i bought the 50mm f/1.4g lens :), thanks for the tips!reply sirisha, you are most welcome!reply nice to see you sharing your knowledge and passion-
reply hi nasim, thanks for the interesting article.
reply hello, i’m choosing between these two lens.
she loves the fact that the lens is very compact, light and yet produces stunningly beautiful images.
will i notice enough difference in the pictures to make it worth the money?
in  addition, the new 50mm f/1.4g is “af-s”, which means autofocus with  a silent wave motor, the autofocus will function on all entry-level cameras  such as nikon d40/d60/d3000 and d5000 that have no autofocus motor in the  camera body (the older nikon 50mm f/1.4d or nikon 50mm f/1.8d will not  autofocus on these cameras).
by the way i mostly shot nature,macro and landscapes.
thank you so much,reply hi nasim!
i am using d3x and many good lenses.
would the 50mm f1.4 also be “longer” and affect it since its a crop sensor camera?reply nasim thanks for that great info.
thanks in advance, savan d. savan, the 18-55mm is a general-purpose lens, so you can take any pictures with it.
and bokeh certainly looks better on the newer “g” lens, because the older “d” lens has a 7 blade diaphragm which produces heptagon-shaped bokeh.
hi nasim, thank you for sharing with all of us your broad knowledge.
reply hi nasim, thank you for the reply.
lens sharpness test at maximum aperture the new nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s is definitely a little sharper wide open  than its predecessor.
reply hello nassim, i have less than a month with my two new lenses.
nikon 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 vrii
reply my brother sold me his d7000.
for closeup photography of the food items i am looking for a lens that will show the item in vivid detail.
so, as soon as the update came out, i pre-ordered one from b&h and  started using it more than the older version for my everyday photography needs.
i’m not absoluted tempted for the moment because under aps-c the 50mm it works as 75mm, and it is not a very useful focal for my work but… probably i will use my old e series in sony nex camera o similiar type with adaptor, for my d300 (future d700) i proyected 50mm f1.8/1.4 w/autofocus to replace my sigma 30mm f1.4 (nice lens but still not perfect)…
i had no macro so i used it as one to photograph insects at a fairly close range and although i didn’t get the results of a macro, the pics were still pretty good.
reply trev, yes, the 50mm f/1.4s lens is a very old version of the 50mm from some early productions.
very interesting review.
the g line means that they removed a feature, the aperature ring.
it’s really nice of you to actually take time to do this.
( maybe it is too slow …) …maybe camera does not allow to be shot when the subject is out of focus..or maybe it is something else…anybody else had a problem like that?typically it behaves like that when is darker …any suggestion?
i think i will use 18-55 for family photos so i’ll buy a 50mm f1.4 for portrait and night shooting.
i take mostly indoor photographs of kids and gatherings (with and w/o a dedicated flash).
the 18-200mm vrii is a very popular lens for obvious reasons, but if changing lenses is not a hinderance, there are other cost effective options (e.g., 18-55 and 55-200) that give better end results.
after reading all the articles on this page my head is spinning.
read more about nasimhere.
reply ok nikon calls it that too, but anyway…they are both d.
reply nasim, from off and on photography i am now seriously developing it as my next few years past time hobby.
karen karen, go for the nikon 50mm f/1.4g – you won’t regret it :)
im working in a ship and luckily every month we are in us so we could buy something useful.
this is nice, because i now do not have to remember to change a  camera switch in order to manually focus in extreme conditions.
with the new 50mm “g”, this problem is eliminated –  you can either set the lens to “m/a” mode, which means  “autofocus with manual override” or “m” mode, which is  fully manual.
i am seriously considering nikon 35mm f/1.8 as part of my gear in the near future.
cherios… farid, don’t buy the nikon 50mm f/1.8d, because it will not autofocus on your d3000.
i’ve check the speed to make sure it’s not too slow – one example of a blurry portrait was taken in the shade at f1.4 speed 1/320 iso 100 and the whole image is blurry – ever so slightly but enough to be out of focus in it’s entirety.
just because they put a new model out doesn’t mean it’s an improvement.
does the 35mm come in f1.4g, haven;t seen that anywhere.
;)reply nasim, thank you.
it is not the best lens in the world, but is good enough for most photography needs.
felix, philippine islands hi nasim, i recently came across your website and i am now scoping out all of your posts.
i also have the 35mm dx 1.8 lens, but i’ll sell it because i don’t use it anymore on my d3000, i only use this 50mm, or the 18-55 kit lens which came with the camera.
i also really like that lens!reply hi nasim, great site.
f1.4 (latest release) instead.
it is very sharp and works great for low-light environments.
if you could, can you advice me which compatible lens is suitable for portraiture and less expensive than the 2 i mentioned?and is it really necessary for me to get a lens with a af-s if i just want to use it to take portraits?
i have a d60 right now
thank you for your feedback :)
let this be a warning to people who buy used gear online…you win some you loose some.
well nice to hear that its more affordable yet a great lens.
what type of photography are you trying to do?
you will have to buy af-s type.
definitely review your images after each shot to see what you need to work on.
could you please tell me what sort of photos this camera/lens is best suited for?
and you article has really helped me- thanyou
thanks in advance!reply jabari, sorry for a late response.
i am going to upgrade to the new d90 soon, but am not sure about the ‘kit’ lens (18-105).
i presently have a d90 with the 18-105 and a 70-300 mm lens.
i’m shopping for a an all around lens to use for portraits.
i am using d90 and it seems to be a good portrait lens.
i’m torn between saving money and wanting to replace my gear with lenses that will have equal performance value with my old ones.
i’m glad i bought it and i love it, no regret.
if you find yourself taking pictures of portraits more than everything else, go for the 50mm.
i have got d3000 and 50 mm f/1.8d!
as for me, i recently had my gear stolen (this past monday, it kinda sucks) and i am going into this from the viewpoint of trying to recover the most necessary lenses.
looks like your 50mm f/1.4d has a front focus issue.
if you have a dx camera and you are looking for a normal lens to be used in low-light environments, then thenikon 35mm f/1.8g is excellent.
i read somewhere that nikon may stop making the 50mm/f1.8d lens since it a money loser for them, so i wanted to get it
if you need better bokeh, just stand closer to the subject.
i have a question regarding my 50mm f/1.4 d lens.
the rebates end this weekend, so i would hurry up if i were you.
i haven’t own a dx body yet, prefer d90.
the nikon 18-70 is an excellent lens, but the lack of vr or high aperture was making me use it less and less than my prime lenses, especially indoors.
reply nasim, i got my d3.
but i also enjoyed using a closeup filter for it, which would not be compatible with the new afs version (it has a 52mm filter size).
when both lenses cannot acquire focus, the time it takes for the  new nikon 50mm f/1.4g to go from infinity to 0.45m (on the distance scale) and  back to infinity is about twice longer compared to the older “d”  version.
if it’s good i will buy this as my first purchase of dslr lense….
in terms of 50mm vs 35mm lenses, see my nikon 35mm vs 50mm article that i published yesterday – i cover all differences and provide recommendations.
i agree that it is a little overpriced given that it doesn’t have high aperture on the long end, so i didn’t buy it new.
reply liliana, thank you for your feedback and you are most welcome!
also if i do which f1.4 lens to go for?
nikon 50mm f/1.4g – at myr1850, maybe not now c)
again, this is not a lens for  architectural photography, so the distortion does not bother me at all.
shalom, what camera body do you have, and what is the reason for wanting to purchase the 50mm or 35mm lens?
but if you stop the lens down  to f/2.0 or higher, this outlining effect pretty much disappears, making the  bokeh look much smoother.
i was also hoping to use it more versatile if possible (maybe also do some macro shots?)
do you have any comments of the store cameta camera?
however, it is not good enough for low-light indoor photos (neither are the 18-200 or 18-105 lenses).
so much fine print to read.
the nikon 50mm f/1.4d lens was one of my  first lenses that i bought and i have been using it more than any other lens,  even today.
i have no idea what to buy, but i do know that i don’t want a cheap quality filter that will downgrade the capabilities of my lens.
reply first to say that you have a really great website for nikon users.
great site and fantastic pix!
i have just bought a nikon d 7000 with its kit lens 18-105 , and also a 35mm f1.8g. my main interest are indoors-portraits, parties, family, food, artifacts etc.
the little square i use to focus on something in a quick moment is off so the space below what i am focusing on is actually in focus.
okay, so from your previous post about nikon naming convention ( http://mansurovs.com/nikon-lens-nomenclature), you say that af-s lenses have autofocus built in.
i found it to be a bit confusing on deciding which one to use for what.
b&h shows lenses “usa” and “imported”, do you know the diference?
reply nice review you got there.
i have a d70 with 18-70 f/3.5-4.5 lens.
(including all models f1.8 and f1.4), all models use a diferent optical formula.
please tell me if i am wrong.
but it is an extreme case and you are probably not going to see many  situations where you have to go from infinity to close distance.
i also have an af nikkor 85mm 1.8.
in the older af-d  version, the lens barrel would change depending on the distance between the  camera and the subject.
the 35mm would probably work best on the d90, because the 50mm might seem a little too long…reply hi nasim, great site and i love it!
now i am shopping for a prime lens and am deciding between a nikkor 35mm 1.8 or nikkor 50mm 1.4g to go with my d90.
i would appreciate to hear your recommendations!reply af-s does have an internal focusing motor.
the manual is too complicated to stand.
i tried to buy directly on best buy
i would recommend a fast aperture lens as your second lens.
i just got the lower end model the 1.4d recently and had a choice to get the 1.4s but was not sure if i should “pay up” the difference.
the lens is surely compatible, so it is most likely a front/back focus issue.
i am debating between the nikkor 50mm f1.4 lens that you reviewed here or the nikkor 60mm f2.8.
f1.4g ( do i need it????)
nikon 50mm f/1.8d – cheapest of the lot at myr 400.00 which one do you think would suit the d90 most, 50mm or 35mm?
it should be the other way around.
50mm f/1.4 is a great lens and will serve you well for portraits.
i was also looking at ken rockwell’s page on these lenses, but i still can’t decide between the two.
i think d5000 is suitable for person like me which is interested to get in here and start to take profesional picture.
omar and osman, captured with the nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s lens 1) key differences autofocus speed, internal focus motor: just like the af-d version, the new  nikon 50mm f/1.4g has no internal focus motor, which is why the autofocus speed  on both lenses is slow.
i think using a micro will give me more detailing as reproduction factor is 1:1 (on fx ofcourse) and i can use it elsewhere also.
i like to take close ups.
do you shoot w/out flash?
let me know if you have any questions.
she heavily  uses this lens for wedding and other event photography as well.
but sure this is a unforgivable lens if you do not care about the focus point.
reply mahmood, thank you for sharing, that’s a lot of great information for siju and other readers.
the 1.4d really doesn’t?reply jabari, yeah, the 1.4d does not allow focus override when set to autofocus…reply sort of an off topic question.
i’m currently shooting from a nikon d90 and i’m getting into concert photography.
which is better performer for indoor shots?reply
good luck with your photography!reply hi nasim, i using d3000 for couple of months now….
what lens would you recommend that won’t cost a lot of money?
please let me know if you have any questions.
i don’t know about nikon, but the boys are too sweet:) lucky you!reply lia, thank you!
it should be cheaper, plus you don’t have to pay taxes…reply jeff, i bought mine at best buy but had to drive an hour away b/c the 4 closer stores did not have it in stock.
yes, you will lock it at minimum aperture and everything will work as expected.
if you want full body portraits, then the 35mm might be a little more practical.
this article is a comparison between the new nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s lens versus the oldernikon 50mm f/1.4d af-d. first of all, i want to start out by saying that the nikon 50mm f/1.4 is my favorite low-light and portrait lens.
now i was wondering the next choice would be either 50mm af-s 1.4g ( as recommended by you!)
it’s got me thinking that i may not really need the 24-70mm.
thank you once again.
reply peng, thank you for your feedback!reply portrait shooting.
thanks!reply btw, great article and website.
distortion: the new 50mm af-s has a little more distortion than the older  af-d version.
harmanizan, the image quality truly depends more on the quality of light, rather than the type of lens you are using.
i didn’t want to invest on a non-nikon lens for my primary walk-around, so the decision was between the 18-105 and 16-85.
i used to have the 1.8.
but the salesman promote me to get d90.
thanks!reply ben, go with the newer nikon 50mm f/1.4g – it is sharper and has better bokeh.
reply mr. nasim, thank you for you wise advice.
for a little more in price, you can also get the nikon 35mm f/1.8g lens, which is a great buy for a dx camera.
thanks!reply hi nassim, i just bought a d7000.
if i were you, i would certainly go for the nikon 50mm f/1.4g.reply thank you !!
with the silent wave motor, the new nikon 50mm  f/1.4g is also much quieter than the older version.
nikon 55-300mm f/4.5-5.6g vr dx af-s ed zoom-nikkor (what do you think of it?)
thanks a lot for this !
but i just don’t know what is wrong!
yeah its nice to order but in my situation its so hard, i am not a us citizen.
i shot some decent pics with it in costa rica.
would the af-s 50mm lens work well with the d200?
hi nasim, i want to ask for the 50mm f/1.4d, because there is no internal focus, whether that is not possible in pairs cpl filter?
my mistake, i thought t was nasim who replied.lol well thanks again for yor respond atleast i had an idea now whats more apt to my d90..
any tips on what i may be doing wrong?
the f/1.2 is a great lens, but the manual focus is something i was never comfortable with, especially when dealing with large apertures between f/1.2 and f/2.8…
thank you again for the great posts.
nikon says they are both considered d lenses.
when shooting at maximum aperture, there is a visible amount of  “outlining” in the bokeh (also present on the older 50mm lens),  which is a visible line around the bokeh circle.
sharpness-wise, the 1.4g is worth the extra $150 in my opinion.
and out doors-landscape, nature and birds.
i’m still just learning but wanted to take it further.
after your 24mm f/1.4, most lenses will look like crap now, including the 16-35mm ;-)
i currently have a 50mm 1.8d. i can’t honestly say that the performance of either 1.4 is enough to make my trade up considering the price difference.
what do you think about it?
i personally favor the 50mm f/1.4g over the 60mm macro.
f1.4g 2 days ago, love it!reply ken, congratulations!
although the focus speed is slightly slower when compared to theolder 50mm af-d lens, there are many more benefits to the new 50mm lens, including increased sharpness and better bokeh.
vignetting/light falloff: there is moderate vignetting visible at maximum  aperture (f/1.4) on both lenses, which is practically eliminated when stopped  down to f/2.0.
my only downfall with the lens, was occasionally the lack of auto focus availability.
reply amazing articles, i really enjoy the food and photography articles.
i also have 35mm af-2d. i am planning to keep this as daylight lens and the new 50mm af-s 1.4g as evening and indoor lens.
my mistake i missed some of the info above, yes it sounds like the af-s is better in a lot of ways over the af.reply
reply hi nasim i am a very big fan of yours.
if you still have it under warranty, i would send it with your camera to nikon and have them fix the focus issue.
the 16-85 is a superb lens for landscape, travel, outdoor photography, and group photos with good light.
i’ve heard the the 24-70mm is better with both.
if you say buy 16-35 than do you thing i need 24mm 1.4 in that case?
maybe the lens in not compatible?
not a concern if you are  shooting digital, but you cannot use it with the older manual focus film  cameras.
thank you,reply hi nasim, first of all, thank you for your wesite, it has been of great help for my photography :)
besides, imho, a single lens cannot give you the picture quality of a combination of primes+zooms.
he is the author and founder ofthe mansurovs, along with a number of other online resources.
and yes, the 1.4d and the 1.8d will work on the d90.reply thanks for the advice nasim….
i will consider the nikon 35mm f/1.8g instead of 50mm f/1.8d….reply
reply quick question….
with the $300 rebate, i wouldn’t bother looking at the 18-105.
i don’t need a long answer, maybe you can point me somewhere?
regards raj dear nasim, thank you for your quick reply.
nikon 35mm f/1.8g – still can afford myr850, some say it’s better than 50mm f/1.8 50mm.
i’ve noticed on other forums that i’m not the only one.
if you want to cover even wider frames, you might want to get a kit lens like the nikon 18-55mm, which is a very inexpensive lens.
honestly, i think both are out of my budget.
could you explain what you do mean by 50mm might seem too long for d90?
thanks ahmed, thank you for your feedback, i appreciate it!
my 50mm and 85mm prime lenses produce much better pictures (even my sigma zoom does).
i’ll try the a-priority mode though.
my new 50mm/f1.8d will have an aperture ring on the lens.
thanks for your help.
i would like to know, it cames with kit lense 18-105mm 3.5-5.6g. its suitable for what type of photograpy?
randi randireply randi, if you already have the af-d version of the 50mm, there is no need to buy the af-s version.
this is 1st time for me to read such a valuable blog and comments when it comes to choose the right lens for your needs.
he is the  author and founder ofthe mansurovs, along with a number of other online  resources.
jeff, the 50mm f/1.4g is “longer” than the 35mm f/1.8g on a d90 due to the 1.5x crop factor associated with nikon dx cameras that are not full frame (d90 is a dx camera).
just a quick question: will the 50mm f 1.4g af-s work with nikon d80?
the nikon 50mm f/1.4g now comes with a lens hood!
bipinreply bipin, thank you for your feedback, i’m sure others will find it useful :)
thanks for your reply.
for many of us, that particular factor is the real deal-breaker
lens front rotation and use with filters: while the 58mm is not a standard  filter size for 50mm lenses, the good news is that the lens thread on the new  nikon 50mm af-s does not rotate when the camera autofocuses.
reply hi nasim, reading so many comments and articles online actually made me more confused :).
i appreciate the help.
i’m also planning to upgrade to fx sooner or later, so i think it’s worth it but what do you think?
reply not only that the 50mm 1.4d is one of the sharpest lenses you can buy so seriously don’t worry about that either.
i will probably buy the nikon 35mm 1.5 as nasim mentioned or the tamron 17-50 2.8 vc if i can spend some more (and sell the 50mm 1.8).
i know d60s don’t have autofocus in the camera body so the lenses have to have them.
if you want a fast af, i would go for the sigma 50mm f1.4.reply oops..
the nikon 50mm f/1.4d lens was one of my first lenses that i bought and i have been using it more than any other lens, even today.
you can either change your shooting mode to “continous” focus or “af-c” or change your autofocus settings so that it lets you fire even when there is no focus on the subject.
i’m a fairly amateur photographer
shalom, you are welcome!
what do u think of 16-85mm lens…is it better than 18-105 in pic quality…is it worth spending extra buck for that lens in place of 16-85mm siju, unless you need a wider angle, go for the 18-105mm lens instead.
since you are on a d3x, i would suggest to go with the 14-24mm f/2.8g instead, because it is sharper.
how could i attach a photo of my granddaughter and grandson to a comment since i would want to share them with as you have kindly shared the photos of your two sons?
hi nasim, thanks for a very interesting comparison of the two lenses.
and i recently purchased my first prime lens – the nikon nikkor af 50mm 50 f/1.4
shot with nikon d300 and nikon 50mm f/1.4g lens @ 1/100, f/4.0 related posts: is a professional photographer based out of denver, colorado.
g, 50mm f/1.4d, 50mm f/1.8g?, 35mm f/1.8.
i think 17-35 is better than 14-24 because it can use filter to protect the lens.
glass in the new lens, sharpness-wise, the new 50mm f/1.4
if space is a problem, go for the 35mm.
reply obi, was it cheaper in best buy than b&h/adorama/amazon or you got it there because you wanted it so bad? :)
as for 17-35mm, i personally found the 16-35mm to be sharper and better than 17-35mm.
reply obi, thank you for your detailed answer, you nailed it.
af-s or the 85mm f/3.5g.
thanks for sharing your expertise!
sony cyber-shot 505 and loved it.
this is great, because the older version did not, and you had to buy it  separately.
lately i’ve been using my 50mm 1.8 a lot.
i’m using canon rebel t2i now.
reply thanks for the review!
i just started a restaurant and need to take pix of the dishes that we introduce from time to time.
the nikon 50mm is great for portraits, but might be too long for everything else…
thank you for your advice.
they both are excellent lenses.
when it comes to flare, i found that it is quite controllable on  both lenses.
if you want to take wider pictures, you might want to look into thenikon 35mm f/1.4g instead, because it is wider than 50mm.
maybe i cannot sleep for one whole week..
the 18-105 produces excellent image quality according to most reviews and for a casual shooter, that should be enough given the price difference.
if the 50mm 1.4g is on par with the 24-70mm in those areas then i’ll get it and put the rest of the money i would have spent on the 70-200mm instead.
focusing in low-light situations is tough and i would suggest using the af assist lamp on your camera in “s” (single) mode to help you get better focus.
home / digital photography / nikon 50mm af-s vs af-d nikon 50mm af-s vs af-d jan  15  2010  january 15, 2010  by nasim  mansurov 188 comments this article is a comparison between the new nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s lens  versus the oldernikon 50mm f/1.4d af-d. first of all, i want to start out by saying that the nikon 50mm f/1.4 is my  favorite low-light and portrait lens.
i have a nikon d7000 (upgraded from d90 and can’t believe how much better the d7000 is!)
those two reasons alone are worth the difference in  pricing between the old 50mm and the new one.
thanks in advance and more power to you and to your family as well!
now i might actually invest in a brand new one.
i have d90 and when using with 50 mm f1.4g nikkor lens the camera does not always let me take a picture…sometimes it does

i do mostly portraits.

if you are getting the nikon 14-24mm lens, then i would skip the 24-70mm range and shoot with the 50mm, if necessary.
i have a nikon d3100 camera and want to buy a prime lens.
(will a lens af conflict with a body’s af?) i was confused between this article’s 50mm f/1.4
reply jeff, sorry for a late response, been super busy lately :( just like obi stated below, 50mm might feel a little too long because of the crop factor on the sensor, which makes it a 75mm equivalent lens.
i would not buy the s version – get the 1.4d instead, which will definitely work on most modern bodies with built-in autofocus.
i own a nikon d7000 and thinking of buying a prime lens.
at first i was put off by ken rockwell’s review which suggests the 28-300mm is a better bet than the 24-120mm f4.
as far as the lens, i personally wouldn’t buy the kit lens or the 16-85mm and would go for the 35mm f/1.8 instead…reply nasim, thanks for your fast reply.
you certainly do not want to be manually focusing a portrait lens, especially if you are a beginner.
affordable but not sure about the performance with my non af motor dslr….

reply i just bought the nikon 50mm
i am not sure if this camera body is considered “old” or “new”?
but they dont have any stock in store.
on a separate note: i do not use my non-vr 18-70 lens that often now-a-days.
i’m really excited to use it on my wedding project first week of december.
to prevent this from happening again.
and i wanted to get a d90 in the near future sometime.
i was wondering if the 1.4 would make even sharper pics.
i’m hesitating between 1.4 and 1.8.
reply hi nasim, just stumbled upon your site.
will appreciate your advise.
the bokeh on the 50mm f/1.4g is superb.
i’m currently using a nikon d5000 with the kit lens, 18-55mm.
how long did it take you to figure out which iso/shutter speed and f stop works best in manual mode in indoor lighting?
mattreply hi nasim, i just got my nikon d3000 body, pairing it with a couple of old manual lenses.
on thing though…my 1.8d allows me to manual focus when the camera is set to autofocus.
instead of buying the 55-300 i bought the 70-300 vr and i am in love of the pictures i have taken with it.
i have earlier used olympus om10 and liked it.
i’m glad you liked our pictures and our website :)
as can be seen from the below screenshots, the difference is certainly visible at maximum aperture.
i love the bokeh and soft focus it produces.
that’s why i am trying to decide on the following: # nikon 16-85mm f/3.5-5.6 vrii # tamron 17-50 f2.8 vc # nikon 18-105mm f/3.5-5.6 vri # tamron 17-50 f2.8 (non vc) #
i use a d90, would the nikon 50mm f/1.4g work well on my camera.
the manual supplied with the camera is a bit too complex and technical to comprehend… :-(.
filter size: the filter size on the f/1.4g version is 58mm, while the  older f/1.4d’s filter size is 52mm.
i apply higher in-camera sharpening and contrast when i shoot with this lens at f1.4, is mine method proper?
i saw in a used-lens shop recently both a 50mm 1.4d and a 50mm 1.4s, which was slightly cheaper than the d. however, i can’t find much info about the s version, do you happen to know anything about it, and whether it’s any good?
thanks, bipin never mind, i just read on yahoo answers that i am supposed to lock the lens aperture ring at f/22 and then let the camera do the adjusting as necessary.
could you please suggest some website which would help me pick up some good photo capturing techniques?
kit lens seems obsolete since i got my hands on af-d 35mm f2.0 lens !
i mainly do families and children.
if your focus is portraits and you want to get the best-looking portraits, get the nikon 50mm f/1.4g.
regards raj i’m using nikon d7000 and planning to buy nikon 50mm 1.8d, will it work fine?????reply nasim, first off, great article.
will now place an order!reply hello i came across your website and liked your articles… i am using a d90 and currently have the 50mm f1.8 af-s (not g).
and i have a doubt for the second one, i am between nikon af-s nikkor 50mm f/1.4g or nikon af-s nikkor 35mm f/1.8g dx wich one would you recommend me?
i mean that it’s goes to 75mm because being a dx.
reply hi siju, i struggled a lot deciding what walk-around lens to buy to go with my new d90 body when i upgraded from d70+18-70 combo.
i don’t have a warranty because i bought it from someone.
for your info, i would like to take picture of my family, landscape, close-up, and my wife as my trial modelling.
i just sold my 24-70mm f2.8 and bougt 24mm 1.4 and af-s 60mm micro g and liked it a lot but it has focus issues with d3x because of absence of focus limiter and it is to narrow for me so i am looking for 50mm af-s .i have more macro lenses so the thing i need is a mid range lens.
i can not figure this out.
shooting wide open on the af-d model will also have soft corners and plenty of vignetting.
either the excellentnikon 35mm f/1.8 or the superb
what do you think of the sigma in comparison to the nikkor 1.4g in terms of sharpness at wide open and colour rendition?
i have d5000 and 2 lenses kit: 18-55 and 55-200.
reply obi and nasim,
tanks you ;) i am wondering if i have a older camera (nikon d40) which lens should i buy?
what this means, is that you will see only a certain portion of the scene, but not the whole thing, sort of like if you were looking through binoculars (except not that long).
its amazingly sharp and gr8 t0 shoot as a prime for my d90.
nikon af-s 50mm f/1.4g vs 35mm f/1.8g i’ve checked through the reviews but couldn’t really finalise what i need.
none of the other lenses you listed above currently have rebates… if you need the 18-200mm range, do not bother with getting two separate lenses.
but he doesn’t seem to look highly on it.
reply hi nasim, can you explain futher please what you mean about 50mm f/1.4
sorry forget to mention that i am refering to the nikon 50mm f1.4d. thanks in advance.
try shooting with different focus points outside and see whether you still have af issues.
which one do you recommend?
what are you shooting with today?reply nasim,, act, i did not buy yet (d5000).
thank you for your advice as always.
hopefully lola will publish a good article soon.
reply what about the nikon d7000?
thank you nasim, -mike thank you for your feedback
and i was thinking about getting the af 50mm 1.8d.
i have a d2x, but i plan to get a d3s in the near future…reply jabari, have you checked out the new nikon 16-35mm f/4.0 vr lens yet?
maybe my luck next time for 35 mm.
any suggestion on a really good filter?
what body do you shoot with?reply no problem!
we have recently experimented with the nikon 35mm f/1.8 dx lens and we loved it so much that my wife now wants one for her food photography.
i want to invest in a 50mm.
reply hi nazim, i really admired the website, but i hv 1 question regarding the 1.4d…
i enjoy reading your articles.
manual focus operation: one of the annoyances of the older nikon 50mm  f/1.4d, was the fact that you could not manually focus the lens while it was  set for autofocus – you had to change the camera to “manual”  focus.
shot with nikon d300 and nikon 50mm f/1.4g lens @ 1/100, f/4.0 tweet nikon 300mm f/4.0
nasim what do you think about the 50 1.8 ?
i was thinking for my needs i don’t need to (only for my blog) but reading this, i wish i had!
i love this 50mm lens
just a little bit portrait.
i am currently using the bundled lens (af-s dx 18-55mm vr f/3.5-5.6g).
af-d @ f1.4 nikon 50mm f1.4g af-s @
since i spent more money getting the d90, i can leverage the internal camera motor to choose a cheaper lens 2.
reply nasim, i have d5000 with 35mm 1.8 af-s dx.
af nikkor 50mm f1.8d ….
and sometimes it does not…i could not figure out why ..does it have to do with camera auto-focus
thanks for your attention!reply great article!
thank you for your help!
omar and osman, captured with the nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s lens the new nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s is definitely a little sharper wide open than its predecessor.
reply jeff, i paid $199 at best buy, only $2 more than the amazon price of $197.
just got myself the d3100.
the prices are much less than the af-s version.
in your professional opinion, would you reccomend i go for the old 50mm f/1.4 to save money and go towards replacing my other 2 stolen lenses and flash unit, or to get this one for the best possible image quality, which might compare to the f/1.2?
also one more question if you are familiar with the d200, what focus zone do you use the most for portraits.
prime 50mm f1.4g or 50mm f1.8d 3. 85mm
i bought it used for a reasonable price and fortunately it is working good for me.
sarah cape cod, usa sarah, thanks for your feedback.
as can be seen from the below screenshots, the difference  is certainly visible at maximum aperture.
i think you have a mistake on your article, the nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s has an internal focus motor, it has a silent wave motor, which allows it to af with cameras like nikon d40/d60 d3000/d5000.
couldn’t decide whether the 1.8 to 1.4 upgrade was worth so much.
but i also wanted it badly at the time.
i’m glad i got it over the af-d version.
it is a great little portrait lens for only $200.reply
don’t forget to set your lens focus switch to “m”.
when you do the maths i.e., 1.5 times the focal length, your effective view using the 50mm will be 75mm which is ‘longer’ than the 52.5mm that you effectively see using the 35mm f/1.8g. for this reason, i bought the 35mm f/1.8g. at only $200, its arguably the best price/pic quality value lens on the market today.
i think you should always mention the price in your reviews, either msrp or street price will do.
if you do not shoot landscapes and need a portrait lens though, i would go for the 50mm f/1.4g instead!reply nasim, after surfing all over the web for real people’s comments and review, your site is the best!
regards,reply hey, was thinking of gettin a 50mm f/1.4 prime.
thanks & god bless!reply hello, very good you article.
surely, at 2.8 and higher , the contrast is better.
it is tough, but you can certainly get pretty good with manual focusing if you practice enough.
after reading your article i’m convinced the 1.4g is the one to go for.
if-ed 5) af-s vr micro-nikkor 105mm f/2.8g if-ed 6) af-s nikkor 35mm f/1.4g and for the speedlight: sb-700 af or sb-900 af speedlight
but do you have anything to say about internal light reflections on dx with larger aperures like 1.4.
your tips are very helpful to me.
in fact, i bought the d90 (in april-10) after getting your advice and i’m loving it (even though d7000 is out).
at f/2.8 and above, the lenses  perform equally well, although the new 50mm tends to have slightly better  corner sharpness all the way to f/5.6.
the framing, sharpness and saturation in your photos are stunning.
i thought about the nikon 18-200 vrii, but from all the reviews i read (and samples i saw), i don’t think it is as good.
my mistake… did not read the rest of the article til now… my apologies…reply
once corrected, all your images should be in good focus.
i am currently exploring the camera and taking a pic here and there when i find time.
in terms of focus zone, i use single area focus in most cases, unless i have a moving subject (in which case i would switch to dynamic area af).
i currently just have the kit lens (18-55mm and the 80-200 zoom lens).
will i get those beautiful panorama and food picture quality (as per attached by u) if i use d5000 with nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s. thanks.

i just upgraded my d40x for the nikon d7000.
after 1 week research about what u have writing, totally its help me mate..!
on my wish list, after reading your articles , are : 1.
do you have an alternative remedy?
if you have a basic camera like the nikon d40/d40x/d3000/d5000/d60, you will need to get an af-s lens such as nikon 35mm f/1.8g. hope this helps.
while nikon did not use any of the new “n” (nano-coated)
i love the article by the way!
may be the newer cmos sensor in the d90 creates better images.
we will be using the images on our website with a click to enlarge option.
af-d @ f1.4 nikon 50mm f1.4g af-s @ f1.4
i took it to a dealer and found that it was “overly” used.
reply thank you for this article.
it is definitely a good thing that you got the nikon d90 over d5000 – you got yourself a semi-professional serious camera with great features.
thanks for pointing that out!
also, in terms of 16-35mm, are you interested in it because of its ultra-wide capabilities?
g thats more longer on d90?
i’m really amazed by its picture quality, and i really love how much i can control the dof.
i suppose a huge diferece between my oldie and the other two lenses…so, i find a good price for an used af-d f1.4, but my cuestion is: there are much differences between all this lenses old e/d/fs at f1.8?
i’m thinking about purchasing 50mm 1.4 af-s and wondering if it’s worth the upgrade?
jasmine, you mean you have the 50mm f/1.4g?
if you need a true portrait lens, however, thenikon 50mm f/1.4g would be a better choice.
i use it for all indoors/low-light photography and especially to photograph my  two boys.
i use it for all indoors/low-light photography and especially to photograph my two boys.
an excellent resource for nikon lovers!
please help me to compare these on sharpness and versatality in taking portraits as well.
yes, i am very lucky to have such a wonderful family! :)
i hope the vr or vc does make a difference.
and it can take filters.
i will inform u after i get that.
sunset panorama, captured with nikon d700 & nikon 50mm f/1.4d lens the nikon 50mm f/1.4g af-s is also my wife’s most favorite lens that  she uses for all of herfood photography.
