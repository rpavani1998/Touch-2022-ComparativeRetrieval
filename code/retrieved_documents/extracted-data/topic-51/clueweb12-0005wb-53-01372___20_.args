chronic overdose is more commonly lethal with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children.[22] aspirin overdose has potentially serious consequences, sometimes leading to significant morbidity and mortality.hemodialysis also has the advantage of restoring electrolyte andacid-base abnormalities; hemodialysis is often life-saving in severely ill patients.however, these doses can have a higher incidence of serious gastrointestinal bleeding, and reduced doses (even the low doses recommended for cardiovascular health (81 mg/day)) also seem to have an anti-cancer effect, albeit not as much as the higher doses.gall bladder - there is some evidence that aspirin may increase gall bladder motility and thus be effective in treating gall bladder disease.patients that have the genetic disease known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (g6pd) should avoid this drug as it is known to cause hemolytic anemia in large doses depending on the severity of the disease.for the prevention of myocardial infarction in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, doses as low as 75 mg daily (or possibly even lower) are sufficient.unfortunately, the byproduct from this is hydrochloric acid , which is corrosive and environmentally hazardous.the side-effect of this is that the ability of the blood in general to clot is reduced, and excessive bleeding may result from the use of aspirin.chronic overdose is more commonly lethal with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children.[22] symptoms edit aspirin overdose has potentially serious consequences, sometimes leading to significant morbidity and mortality.low-dose, long-term aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane a2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation.this anticoagulant property makes it useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks.more significant symptoms occur in more severe poisonings and include hyperthermia, tachypnea, respiratory alkalosis, metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia ,hypoglycemia, hallucinations, confusion, seizure, cerebral edema, and coma.aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its non-competitive and irreversible inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (cox) enzyme.prompt hospital treatment may be life-saving.aspirin irreversibly inhibits cox-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of cox-2.
