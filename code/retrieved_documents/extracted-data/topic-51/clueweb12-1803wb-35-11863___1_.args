therapy with nac has been shown to decrease mortality rates in late-presenting patients with fulminant hepatic failure (in the absence of acetaminophen in the serum).nac also functions as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant and has positive inotropic and vasodilating effects, which improve microcirculatory blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues.in one of the typical ploys to increase profits, ibuprofen is touted as being less upsetting to the stomach and less likely to cause bleeding.vasodilating effects decrease morbidity and mortality once hepatotoxicity is well established.patients with malnutrition, aids, chronic ethanol abuse, or anorexia nervosa may be at increased risk for morbidity because of deficient glutathione stores and inadequate detoxification of napqi.if correctly treated in a timely manner, most patients do not suffer significant sequelae.both ibuprofen and aspirin cause gastrointestinal bleeding because they are chemical that are irritating and the dosages is high (325 mg or more for aspirin, 400 & 800 mg for ibuprofen).however, as a patient's history often is inaccurate, the serum acetaminophen concentration is important for diagnosis and treatment, even in the absence of symptoms.case series report that fewer than 4% of patients who suffer severe hepatotoxicity develop hepatic failure; fatalities or liver transplantation occur in less than one half of these patients.patients with enhanced ability to make napqi because of induction of the p450 system, specifically cyp2e1, may be at increased risk of morbidity; these patients include those taking agents known to induce this enzyme activity, such as rifampin, phenobarbital, isoniazid, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or patients with chronic ethanol abuse.pediatric patients younger than 5 years appear to fare better than adults after apap poisoning, perhaps owing to a greater capacity to conjugate acetaminophen, enhanced detoxification of napqi, or greater glutathione stores.the toxic dose of apap after a single acute ingestion is 150 mg/kg or approximately 7 g in adults, although the at-risk dose may be lower in persons with alcoholism and other susceptible individuals.for these reasons, antiemetic therapy often is necessary to allow successful administration of nac.under conditions of excessive napqi formation or reduced glutathione stores, napqi is free to covalently bind to vital proteins and the lipid bilayer of hepatocytes; this results in hepatocellular death and subsequent centrilobular liver necrosis.gastrointestinal bleeding both ibuprofen and aspirin cause gastrointestinal bleeding because they are chemical that are irritating and the dosages is high (325 mg or more for aspirin, 400 & 800 mg for ibuprofen).
