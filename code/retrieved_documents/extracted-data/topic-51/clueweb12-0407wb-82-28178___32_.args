the body's natural painkillers may yet prove to be the most promising pain relievers, pointing to one of the most important new avenues in drug development.although placebos have no direct effect on the underlying causes of pain, evidence from clinical studies suggests that many pain conditions such as migraine headache, back pain, post-surgical pain, rheumatoid arthritis, angina, and depression sometimes respond well to them.opioids have a narcotic effect, that is, they induce sedation as well as pain relief, and some patients may become physically dependent upon them.they can have serious side effects in some people and therefore, as with all prescription medicines, should be used only under a doctor's care.continued research may result in a better understanding of how pain affects women differently from men, enabling new and better pain medications to be designed with gender in mind.because there is a known link between many types of chronic pain and tense, weak muscles, exercise-even light to moderate exercise such as walking or swimming-can contribute to an overall sense of well-being by improving blood and oxygen flow to muscles.there is evidence that the proteins that are ultimately synthesized by these genes may be targets for new therapies.for example, many individuals suffering from trigeminal neuralgia who are not responsive to drug treatment have had great success with a procedure called microvascular decompression, in which tiny blood vessels are surgically separated from surrounding nerves.improvements in our understanding of the precise role of cytokines in producing pain, especially pain resulting from injury, may lead to new classes of drugs that can block the action of these substances.nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) work by blocking two enzymes, cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2, both of which promote production of hormones calledprostaglandins, which in turn cause inflammation, fever, and pain.in addition, anti-anxiety drugs called benzodiazepines also act as muscle relaxants and are sometimes used as pain relievers.newer drugs, called cox-2 inhibitors, primarily block cyclooxygenase-2 and are less likely to have the gastrointestinal side effects sometimes produced by nsaids.neuropathic pain can occur in any part of the body and is frequently described as a hot, burning sensation, which can be devastating to the affected individual.counseling can give a patient suffering from pain much needed support, whether it is derived from family, group, or individual counseling.using "knockout" animal models-animals genetically engineered to lack a certain gene-scientists are able to visualize how mutations in genes cause animals to become anxious, make noise, rear, freeze, or become hypervigilant.
