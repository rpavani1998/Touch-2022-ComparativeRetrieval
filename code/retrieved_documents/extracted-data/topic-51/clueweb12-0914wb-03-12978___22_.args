the pharmacological activity of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.there is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious cv thrombotic events associated with nsaid use.clinical trials of several cox-2 selective and nonselective nsaids of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (cv) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal.as with any opioid analgesic agent, hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets should be used with caution in elderly or debilitated patients, and those with severe impairment of hepatic or renal function, hypothyroidism, addisonâ€™s disease, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture.proper assessment of the patient, proper prescribing practices, periodic re-evaluation of therapy, and proper dispensing and storage are appropriate measures that help to limit abuse of opioid drugs.hydrocodone, as well as other opioid analgesics, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.opioid agonists have the potential for being abused and are sought by abusers and people with addiction disorders, and are subject to diversion.the respiratory depressant effects of opioids and their capacity to elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure may be markedly exaggerated in the presence of head injury, intracranial lesions or a preexisting increase in intracranial pressure.maois have been reported to intensify the effects of at least one opioid drug causing anxiety, confusion and significant depression of respiration or coma.gastrointestinal risk nsaids cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal.nsaids, including hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal (gi) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal.physicians should be aware that abuse of opioids can occur in the absence of true addiction and is characterized by misuse for non-medical purposes, often in combination with other psychoactive substances.a patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of more severe hepatic reactions while on hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablet therapy.neuromuscular blocking agents hydrocodone, as well as other opioid analgesics, may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of skeletal muscle relaxants and produce an increased degree of respiratory depression.in these patients, administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation.
