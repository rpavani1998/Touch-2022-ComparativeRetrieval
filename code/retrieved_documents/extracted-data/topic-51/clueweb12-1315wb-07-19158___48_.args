although children with symptoms of chronic fatigue have not been as rigorously studied as adults, limited evidence suggests that cfs can be significantly disabling in young people.these drugs may provide benefits by promoting deep sleep and inhibiting pain pathways in the nervous system.nsaids can also increase blood pressure, particularly among people already being treated for hypertension.although cbt doesn't bring patients completely back to normal, research has found that people who use the therapy have higher mental health scores, and are able to walk faster and with less fatigue than those who did not use cbt.in one study, sharing experiences in a group therapy setting proved to be the most valuable component in treatment, and it improved patients' coping abilities.depression in these patients was associated with lower self-esteem and an increased likelihood of suicidal thoughts.psychostimulants may be helpful for a subgroup of patients with cfs who have cognitive problems, such as difficulty concentrating, memory problems, and other attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd)-like characteristics.cbt is effective at reducing the symptoms of fatigue compared with usual care, and it appears to be more effective than other psychological therapies.a review of clinical trials found that exercise therapy is beneficial for cfs, particularly when combined with patient education.the popular antidepressants known as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (ssris) may be helpful for the subgroup of cfs patients who experience significant depression.antidepressants known as tricyclics may be particularly helpful for cfs patients.many patients have severe conditions, and some are very incapacitated (such as being wheelchair bound).for patients with severe cfs that cannot be managed with lifestyle changes and standard medications, asking the physician about enrolling in any available clinical trials may be helpful.there is some evidence that stress may trigger cfs in people who are genetically at risk for the disease.cognitive therapy may also be an effective treatment for adolescents with cfs.
