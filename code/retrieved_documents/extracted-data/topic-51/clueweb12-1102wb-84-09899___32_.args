improved management of antithrombotic drugs [warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel] and antidiabetic drugs [especially insulin] has the potential to reduce hospitalizations for adverse drug events in older adults.”although warfarin has saved many lives, its one big drawback is that, by reducing blood clotting, it increases the risk of bleeding.ttp is a life-threatening adverse effect that is characterized by a breakdown of red blood cells, low levels of cells that help stop bleeding (platelets), fever, mental changes and kidney problems.although the risk of bleeding in people taking warfarin cannot be completely reduced, even with optimal management, patients taking the drug are less likely to have bleeding problems if they follow dosage directions very carefully, and have their blood tested to measure the degree of clotting inhibition exactly as they have been advised.researchers have struggled to show that clopidogrel is better than aspirin in preventing certain cardiovascular incidents such as heart attack and stroke, and they have been largely unsuccessful in doing this.a study published in 2008, investigating the effect of the heartburn drug omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor [ppi]) on the action of clopidogrel plus aspirin therapy, found that omeprazole significantly decreased the effect of clopidogrel, meaning that clopidogrel could then be less effective in preventing strokes and heart attacks.acetaminophen may interact with warfarin to increase the risk of bleeding, a risk that rises with increasing doses of acetaminophen.because the retail cost of clopidogrel is at least 100 times greater than the cost of aspirin and is no better than aspirin in preventing a second heart attack or stroke, its use should be limited to those who cannot take aspirin.a recent study confirmed that antiplatelet medications such as aspirin or nsaids caused a substantial increase in serious stomach bleeding in people taking warfarin.it is used to initiate treatment of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism because of its rapid onset of action.many patients are prescribed drugs by several different health care professionals: general physicians, specialists, dentists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and others.warfarin is also used in patients with abnormal heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillation, which can cause clots to form in the heart and then travel to the brain, resulting in a stroke.in addition, the drug is used to prevent second heart attacks in some patients who have already had one, to prevent clots in patients with artificial heart valves and to treat a number of other blood clotting problems.this means that warfarin is being destroyed too fast so warfarin levels are reduced, the patient’s inr goes below the desired range, and the patient is more at risk of having a serious blood clot.a further analysis of the trial mentioned immediately above found that in patients with acute coronary syndrome who were taking aspirin, adding clopidogrel was beneficial, compared to a placebo, in reducing major cardiovascular events.
