some children who are not responding well to acetaminophen may respond better to ibuprofen.these products may be used to make a child more comfortable, but they do not treat the underlying illness.sponge baths may be useful with heatstroke, confusion associated with high fevers, or in children who are prone to febrile seizures.to assess how sick a child is when he or she has a fever, give an appropriate dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen (see chart below), and see how he or she is behaving about one to two hours after the dose.ear thermometers are not very reliable in children less than 6 months of age, or for temperatures over 102° f. high fevers do not cause brain damage unless greater than 107° f or associated with diseases that affect the brain, like meningitis (an infection of the fluid that covers the brain and spinal cord).fever reducing medications fever medicines help to bring a fever down and make a child more comfortable.seizures associated with fevers only occur in about 3 to 5 percent of the population and these are called febrile seizures.one advantage of ibuprofen is the longer-lasting effect of six to eight hours of fever reduction.children are more prone to dehydration compared to adults.the treatment involves controlling the fever aggressively with acetaminophen or ibuprofen.mild symptoms can include muscle cramps, stomachache and headache.fevers of 100.4° f or greater in any baby younger than 3 months of age may be a sign of serious illness, and you should call your doctor immediately.if your child is resting comfortably, there is no need to wake him or her to give acetaminophen, unless your child is prone to febrile seizures.because a child has a history of febrile seizures does not mean he or she will have epilepsy as an adult.once they have contacted their doctor, many parents find out they have not given their child enough acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
