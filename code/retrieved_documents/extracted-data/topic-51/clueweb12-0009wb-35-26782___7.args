external pyrogens include toxins (poisons) produced by infectious viruses or bacteria.
however, body temperature varies between people, with different levels of activity and at different times of the day.
expected duration depending on its cause, a fever may disappear in a day or last for weeks.
sustained body temperatures of 106° fahrenheit or above can cause brain damage.
in children, reduce fever by using acetaminophen or ibuprofen, together with lukewarm sponge baths.
fever develops when the hypothalamus is set to a higher-than-normal temperature.
internal pyrogens include abnormal chemicals that are produced by tumors and proteins that are released during the normal response of the immune system.
eat light foods that are easy to digest.
diagnosis in pinpointing a fever's cause, your doctor may ask about: cold or flu symptoms abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea burning or pain with urination pain or discomfort in any part of your body contact with sick people at home, work or school the types of food you've eaten recently any recent exposure you have had to animals, including pets whether you have any implanted prosthetic or mechanical device, such as an artificial joint or mechanical heart valve any recent surgery, cuts or large areas of broken skin chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis
prognosis for most fevers caused by common infections, the person either recovers on their own or the doctor is able to identify and treat the cause.
a part of the brain called the hypothalamus acts as the body's thermostat.
in infants and toddlers, febrile seizures typically cause muscle rigidity and generalized convulsions that last less than 15 minutes.
when all is well in the body, the hypothalamus is set at the normal body temperature.
for example, a fever accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea may signal gastroenteritis, and a fever associated with coughing, shortness of breath and grayish-yellow phlegm may indicatepneumonia.
limit exposure to crowds and to people with known infections.
specific symptoms associated with a fever often can provide clues to help identify the fever's cause.
when all is well in the body, the hypothalamus is set at the normal body temperature.
prevention you can reduce your risk of getting illnesses that cause fever by adopting these healthy habits: practice good hygiene by washing your hands frequently with soap and warm water, especially after using the toilet and before eating.
high fever can lead to symptoms of mental dysfunction, such as confusion, excessive sleepiness, irritability and convulsions (seizures).
call a doctor immediately if an infant younger than 3 months develops any fever.

external pyrogens include toxins (poisons) produced by infectious viruses or bacteria.

depending on your symptoms and the results of your physical examination, you may need diagnostic tests, including laboratory examination of body fluids (blood, urine, stool or spinal fluid); special x-rays or scans; or abiopsy (taking a sample of body tissue for laboratory examination).
this resetting of the hypothalamus is usually caused by small molecules called pyrogens in the blood.
treatment doctors often advise adults with mild to moderate fevers below 102° fahrenheit to: - drink plenty of water and fruit juices to prevent dehydration (abnormally low levels of body water).
causes of fever include: hundreds of types of viruses, bacteria and parasites that cause many illnesses, such as upper respiratory infections, pneumonia, diarrhea and urinary tract infections chronic (long-term) conditions associated with inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis severe trauma, including surgery reactions to medications or immunizations certain types of cancers symptoms common symptoms associated with fever include sweating, shivering, headaches, muscle aches, poor appetite, rash, restlessness and general body weakness.
high fever can lead to symptoms of mental dysfunction, such as confusion, excessive sleepiness, irritability and convulsions (seizures).
pyrogens can come from outside the body (external) or can be produced inside the body (internal).

however, body temperature varies between people, with different levels of activity and at different times of the day.
depending on the suspected site of infection, your doctor may then examine your: - skin for signs of rash or infection - lymph nodes for swelling (a sign of nearby infection) - eyes for redness or jaundice (yellowing of the whites of the eyes) - mouth and throat for signs of pharyngitis (throat infection) or a tooth abscess - cardiovascular system for heart failure or infections involving the heart - chest for lung infection - abdomen for infections of the gallbladder, intestine or appendix - joints for arthritis - genitals for sexually transmitted diseases - nervous system for encephalitis (brain infection) or meningitis (inflammation or infection involving the membranes covering the brain)
