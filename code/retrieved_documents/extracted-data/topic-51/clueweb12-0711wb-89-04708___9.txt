such results piqued drug company interest and, by the end of the1980s, five more studies had been carried out.
one study found that 30-40 per cent of elderly people do not respond to vaccination (hum immunol, 1994; 40: 202-9), and even if an immune response occurs, there is doubt as to whether this reduces the incidence of influenza (vaccine, 1994; 12: 1185-9).
echinacea, one of the best-selling otc herbals, has also shown mixed  efficacy.
more recent reviews of the evidence say that, while vitamin c can alleviate cold symptoms, taking large doses is not preventative (cochrane database syst rev, 2000; [2]: cd000980).
but then, in 1996, another study suggested that zinc lozenges were effective against cold symptoms (ann intern med, 1996; 125: 81-8), thus launching zinc back on the road to popularity.
only 27 per cent of the low-stress group showed clinical symptoms compared with 47 per cent of those at the high end of the scale (n engl j med, 1991; 325: 606-12).
the key to these and other remedies may be to treat at the first signs of cold or flu.
smokers are also more susceptible to upper respiratory tract infection (urti; am j public health, 1993; 83: 1277-83).
but if exposure were the only factor, all of us would get sick every time we were exposed.
this was the last straw in more than a decade of studies of ppa.
however, taken as a whole, the evidence for the efficacy of zinc lozenges is inconclusive (cochrane database syst rev, 2000

even if the vaccine is for the right strain of myxovirus, for  reasons not yet fully understood, you may not respond by producing anti-bodies  to it.
the ability of stress to alter immune function, and precipitate and aggravate infectious diseases has long been recognised (j fla med assoc, 1993; 80: 409-11).

one trial of zinc lozenges (12.8 mg) found that patients taking one every  two to three hours early in the course of a cold reduced the duration and  severity of their symptoms, especially cough (ann intern med, 2000; 133:  245-52).
predicting a flu epidemic is not an exact science, as was elegantly illustrated in 1976 when us officials, spurred on by illness among soldiers at fort dix, new jersey, predicted a swine flu epidemic as lethal as the great flu pandemic of 1918.
* non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as aspirin,  paracetamol (acetaminophen) and ibuprofen may in fact increase nasal symptoms.

overuse of antibiotics also contributes to the emergence of ‘superbugs’, and can deplete the friendly gut bacteria needed to maintain good health and immunity.
