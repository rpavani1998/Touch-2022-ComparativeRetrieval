accurate reports of physician performance will allow physicians to effectively assess and improve their performance, and enable consumers and purchasers to make informed decisions concerning treatments, coverage and the quality of care.this would make the necessary critical care services readily available to the patients who are most in need.for the sickest infants and children, pediatric intensive-care units provide the highest level of medical care, treating children after complicated surgeries, severe illness or accidents.though the study’s accuracy rate is under that 90-percent figure, it still means the test potentially could have great value to physicians and patients and their families, and the results are particularly significant for patients who have limited access to teaching hospitals, where they may undergo six to 12 months of evaluation for a diagnosis.the finding, based on a study using rats and published in the april issue of thejournal of hypertension, may ultimately revolutionize emergency stroke care by putting blood pressure-lowering medications alongside clot-busting drugs and blood thinners as front-line medications.the knowledge of the genetic sequence of this new virus will enable improvements in screening that may enhance the future safety of organ transplantation.the combination of these two technologies will give hospitals a continuous and noninvasive way to accurately monitor a patient’s oxygenation and ventilation during patient-controlled analgesia, consistent with the new recommendations from the anesthesia patient safety foundation (apsf).as a result, phone calls and other manual interventions to manage care progression are reduced resulting in more timely care and a quieter patient environment.early detection would likely help patients better manage the disease and could even save lives.critically ill patients, pediatric patients and immuno-compromised patients may be at greatest risk from the use of these devices.the finding could have far-reaching consequences for the diagnosis of depression, the growing use of symptom checklists to identify those who may be depressed, and the $12 billion-a-year u.s. market for antidepressant drugs.the viruses can cause a serious, and sometimes deadly, disease known as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, or hfrs.their response is crucial because patient survival rates are directly impacted by how quickly the patient is assessed and treated; swift clinical intervention decreases patient mortality rates significantly.hepatitis b is a serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the liver and can cause lifelong infection, liver cancer, liver failure and death.the medications, all statins, seem to lower the risk of a potentially lethal blood infection known as sepsis in patients on kidney dialysis.
