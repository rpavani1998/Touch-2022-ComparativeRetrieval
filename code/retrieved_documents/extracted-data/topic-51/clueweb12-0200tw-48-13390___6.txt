although some enteric coated formulations of aspirin are advertised as being "gentle to the stomach", in one study enteric coating did not seem to reduce this risk.[85] combining aspirin with other nsaids has also been shown to further increase this risk.[85] using aspirin in combination with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.[86]

as with all other medications for  migraine, it is recommended to take aspirin at the first signs of the headache,  and it is the way these medications were used in the comparative clinical  trials.[25] aspirin alleviates pain in 60–75% of patients with episodic tension  headaches.[26][27] it is equivalent to paracetamol (acetaminophen) in that  respect, except for the higher frequency of gastrointestinal side-effects.[27]  comparative clinical trials indicatedmetamizole and ibuprofen may relieve pain  faster than aspirin, although the difference becomes insignificant after about  two hours.

owing to the issue of solubility, however, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, andplasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.[130][131][132] about 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is bound by protein, while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent.

this antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the  incidence of heart attacks.[121] 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit  a large proportion of maximum thromboxane a2 release provoked acutely, with the  prostaglandin i2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of  aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.[122] prostaglandins are local hormones produced in the body and have diverse  effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain,  modulation of thehypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation.
chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%;[verification needed] chronic overdose may be especially severe in children.[103] toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, includingactivated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis.[104] the diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods.

in comparison, there was  an estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction of 137 events per  10.000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10.000 persons in ischemic  stroke.[99] in cases where ich already has occurred, aspirin use results in  higher mortality, with a dose of approximately 250 mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within three months after the ich of approximately 2.5  (95%confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6).[100] aspirin and other nsaids can cause hyperkalemia by inducing a hyporenin  hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however,  these agents do not typically causehyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of  normal renal function and euvolemic state.[101] aspirin can cause prolonged bleeding after operations for up to 10 days.

owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people withpeptic ulcers, mild diabetes , orgastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin.[78][82] even if none of these conditions is present, there is still an increased risk ofstomach bleeding when aspirin is taken withalcohol or warfarin.[78][79] patients with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates.[78]
[ 82] aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic diseaseglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (g6pd), in particular in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease.[83] use of aspirin duringdengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency.[84] people withkidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excreteuric acid, and thus may exacerbate these conditions.

however, recent research suggests the high death toll of the 1918 flu was partly due to aspirin, as the doses used at times can lead to toxicity, fluid in the lungs, and, in some cases, contribute to secondary bacterial infections and mortality.[147] aspirin's profitability led to fierce competition and the proliferation of aspirin brands and products, especially after the american patent held by bayer expired in 1917.[148][149]

heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acutemyocardial infarction.
aspirin was found to have a  protective effect on hepatocytes because it led to the "downregulation of  proinflammatory cytokines".[64] in another 2009 article published by the journal of the american medical  association, men and women who regularly took aspirin after colorectal cancer  diagnosis were found to have lower risks of overall and colorectal cancer death  compared to patients not using aspirin.[65] a 2010 article in the journal of clinical oncology has suggested aspirin  may reduce the risk of death from breast cancer.[66] while the information has  been well-circulated by the media,[67][68] official health bodies and medical  groups have expressed concern over the touting of aspirin as a "miracle  drug".[69] a 2010 study by oxford university involving over 25000 patients showed  taking a small (75 mg) daily dose of aspirin for between four and eight  years substantially reduces death rates from a range of common cancers by at  least a fifth and the reduction of risk continued for 20 years in both men and  women.
thus, the protective anticoagulative effect ofpgi2 is removed,  increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other  circulatory problems.

in addition, the high doses of aspirin  used caused liver toxicity in about 20% of the treated children,[40][41] who  are the majority of rheumatic fever patients, and increased the risk of their  developingreye's syndrome.[39] naproxen was shown to be as effective as aspirin  and less toxic; due to the limited clinical experience, however, naproxen is  recommended only as a second-line treatment.[39][42] along with rheumatic fever, kawasaki disease remains one of the few  indications for aspirin use in children, although even this use has been  questioned by some researchers.[43] in the united kingdom, the only indications  for aspirin use in children and adolescents under 16 are kawasaki disease and  prevention of blood clot formation.

in a 1979 research study, a dose of 350 milligrams of dgl was shown to decrease the amount of gastrointestinal bleeding induced by three adult-strength aspirin tablets (750 milligrams).[90] a dose of 500 milligrams of s-adenosyl-methionine (same, an amino acid naturally formed in the body) given together with a large dose of aspirin (1300 milligrams) in a research study reduced the amount of stomach damage by 90 percent.[91] a study found that, in contrast to oral aspirin, intravenous injection of aspirin did not produce detectable histological damage or significantly alter gastric mucosal potential difference, and concluded that high blood levels of circulating salicylate did not acutely damage gastric mucosa, so that gastric mucosal damage produced acutely after single oral doses of aspirin are due to itstopical, rather than systemic, action.[92] [edit] central effects large doses of salicylate, a metabolite of aspirin, have been proposed to causetinnitus (ringing in the ears) based on experiments in rats, via the action onarachidonic acid and nmda receptors cascade.[93] [edit] reye's syndrome main article: reye's syndrome reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver, can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illnesses or infections.
in general, for adults, doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis,[74] with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever.[75] for the prevention of myocardial infarction in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, much lower doses are taken once daily.[74] new recommendations from the us preventive services task force (uspstf, march, 2009) on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction inmyocardial infarction (mi) for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage.[76] the whi study said regular low dose (75 or 81 mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause.[76] low dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81 mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for patients requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.[76] in children with kawasaki disease, aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight, initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks.[77
after the association between reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported and safety measures to prevent it (including asurgeon general's warning and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the united states, as did the number of reported cases of reye's syndrome; a similar decline was found in the united kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued.[94]

with large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first  order to zero order, asmetabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion  becomes increasingly important.[132] salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%),  free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (< 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid.[133] when small doses  (less than 250 mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by  first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 to 4.5 hours.

the maximum dose of aspirin (1 g) provides weaker pain relief than an intermediate dose of ibuprofen (400 mg), and this relief does not last as long.[12] a combination of aspirin and codeine may have a slightly higher analgesic effect than aspirin alone; however, this difference is not clinically meaningful.[13] it appears ibuprofen is at least equally, and possibly more, effective than this combination.[14]

for example, acetazolamide andammonium chloride have been known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicyclates, andalcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs.[78][79] aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from protein binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, the immunosuppressant methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, an important part of valproate metabolism) and any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.
newer nsaid drugs,cox 2 inhibitors, have been developed to inhibit only ptgs2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side-effects.[8] however, several of the new cox 2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (vioxx), have been withdrawn recently, after evidence emerged that ptgs2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack.

owing to the issue of solubility, however,  aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, andplasma concentrations  can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.[130][131][132] about 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is bound by protein, while  the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is  concentration-dependent.
in several studies, its use did not reduce the incidence of prostate cancer.[49][50] its effects on the incidence of pancreatic cancer are  mixed; one study published in 2004 found a statistically significant increase  in the risk of pancreatic cancer among women,[51] while a meta-analysis of  several studies, published in 2006, found no evidence aspirin or other nsaids  are associated with an increased risk for the disease.[52] the drug may be  effective in reduction of risk of various cancers, including those of thecolon,[ 53][54][55][56][57] [58] lung,[59][60] and possibly the upper gi tract, though  some evidence of its effectiveness in preventing cancer of the upper gi tract  has been inconclusive.[61][61][62]
