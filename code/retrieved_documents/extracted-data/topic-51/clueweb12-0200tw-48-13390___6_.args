heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acutemyocardial infarction.in several studies, its use did not reduce the incidence of prostate cancer.[49][50] its effects on the incidence of pancreatic cancer are mixed; one study published in 2004 found a statistically significant increase in the risk of pancreatic cancer among women,[51] while a meta-analysis of several studies, published in 2006, found no evidence aspirin or other nsaids are associated with an increased risk for the disease.[52] the drug may be effective in reduction of risk of various cancers, including those of thecolon,[ 53][54][55][56][57] [58] lung,[59][60] and possibly the upper gi tract, though some evidence of its effectiveness in preventing cancer of the upper gi tract has been inconclusive.[61][61][62]for both males and females diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, aspirin reduces the chance of a heart attack and ischaemic stroke by about a fifth.[citation needed] this translates to an absolute rate reduction from 8.2% to 6.7% of such events per year for people already with cardiovascular disease.[citation needed] although aspirin also raises the risk ofhemorrhagic stroke and other major bleeds by about twofold, these events are rare, and the balance of aspirin's effects is positive.a combination of aspirin and caffeine, in general, affords greater pain relief than aspirin alone.this reduced leukocyte adhesion, which is an important step in immune response to infection; however, there is currently insufficient evidence to show that aspirin helps to fight infection.[124] more recent data also suggests that salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling throughnf-κb.[125] nf-κb, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.[ 82] aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic diseaseglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (g6pd), in particular in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease.[83] use of aspirin duringdengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency.[84] people withkidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excreteuric acid, and thus may exacerbate these conditions.the effects of aspirin were indistinguishable from those obtained using paracetamol in any respect, except for, possibly, a slightly higher incidence of sweating and gastrointestinal side-effects.[37] fever and joint pain of acute rheumatic fever respond extremely well, often within three days, to high doses of aspirin.low-dose, long-term aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane a2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation.in addition, the risks of hemorrhagic strokes and gastrointestinal bleeding almost completely offset the benefits of aspirin.in addition, aspirin induces the formation of no-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation.[edit] effects upon hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity aspirin, like other medications affecting prostaglandin synthesis, has profound effects on thepituitary gland, which indirectly affects a number of other hormones and physiological functions.because the platelet patch can become too large and also block blood flow, locally and downstream, aspirin is also used long-term, at low doses, to help preventheart attacks, strokes, and blood clot formation in people at high risk of developing blood clots.[3]aspirin irreversibly inhibits cox-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of cox-2.chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%;[verification needed] chronic overdose may be especially severe in children.[103] toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, includingactivated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis.[104]this antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks.[121] 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane a2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin i2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.[122] prostaglandins are local hormones produced in the body and have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of thehypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation.
