patients report critical reductions in levels of physical activity and a reduction in the complexity of activity has been observed, with reported impairment comparable to other fatiguing medical conditions such as late-stage aids, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), and the effects of chemotherapy.cfs affects a person's functional status and well-being more than major medical conditions such asmultiple sclerosis, congestive heart failure, or type ii diabetes mellitus.studies suggest that cfs may be caused by inflammation along the nervous system, and that this inflammation may be some sort of immune response or process.examples of chronic fatigue syndrome symptoms include headaches, tender lymph nodes,sore throat, muscle pain, joint pain, feeling tired, and feeling discomfort after physical exertion.to be diagnosed with this condition, your tiredness must be severe enough to decrease your ability to participate in ordinary activities by 50%.symptoms of cfs are similar to those of most common viral infections (muscle aches,headache, and fatigue).stimulants may be helpful, but strong stimulants may cause the "push-crash cycle" and lead to relapse.while some lead relatively normal lives, others are totally bed-ridden and unable to care for themselves.since there is not a specific lab test that reliably identifies chronic fatigue syndrome, and because cfs closely resembles other illnesses such as mononucleosis,fibromyalgia, lyme disease, and multiple sclerosis, the first diagnostic step usually involves a series of tests that will help the physician rule out other illnesses.moderate exercise that is monitored by a doctor or physical therapist may improve symptoms.diagnosing chronic fatigue syndrome since there is not a specific lab test that reliably identifies chronic fatigue syndrome, and because cfs closely resembles other illnesses such as mononucleosis,fibromyalgia, lyme disease, and multiple sclerosis, the first diagnostic step usually involves a series of tests that will help the physician rule out other illnesses.to discover possible triggers, researchers are studying the relationship betweenstress, the immune system, toxins, the central nervous system, and activation of latent virus.cognitive behavioral therapy, activity pacing, and envelope theory can help moderate activity and spread it evenly throughout the day, without overexertion.furthermore, they're not just dealing with extreme fatigue but with a wide range of other symptoms, including flu-like symptoms and chronic pain.it's important to note that the signs and symptoms are often similar to those of other health conditions.
