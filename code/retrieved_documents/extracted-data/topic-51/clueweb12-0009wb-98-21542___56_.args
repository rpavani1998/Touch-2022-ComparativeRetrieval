acupuncture has not proven to have any value for acute low back pain in most patients, but may provide some help for patients with chronic low back pain.proton pump inhibitors are possibly the most protective agents and can actually heal existing ulcers.according to these studies, contraction exercises specifically designed to retrain these muscles may be effective for patients with both acute and chronic pain.the use of common pain relievers, such as nsaids, physical therapy, and steroid or other spinal injections may be helpful for some patients.one 2000 study observed that the cox-2 inhibitors had some adverse effects on kidney function, particularly in elderly people, that were similar to the effects of standard nsaids.specific and regular exercise under the guidance of a trained professional is important for reducing pain and improving function, although it is often very difficult to sustain.the positive benefits of exercise not only affect strength and flexibility but they also alter and improve the patients' attitudes toward their disability and pain.long-term bed rest results in loss of muscle tone and bone strength, increases susceptibility to blood clots, and causes depression and lethargy.some physicians have recommended long-term opioids for patients with severe chronic pain, but studies suggest they do not improve activity levels and can have significant side effects.many studies have now confirmed that patients feel more satisfied with their chiropractic care than with treatment from general practitioners.corticosteroids reduce inflammation and this approach may short-cut sciatic pain until the body heals itself.these agents may prove to be as effective and less harmful to the gi tract than nsaids.this form of psychologic therapy helps change behavior and attitudes toward pain, and may be helpful for dealing with pain.the use of cox-2 inhibitors can interfere with many other drugs taken concurrently, including many taken for heart disease and high blood pressure.it also, like any drug, most likely has side effects and may even be harmful for some people.
