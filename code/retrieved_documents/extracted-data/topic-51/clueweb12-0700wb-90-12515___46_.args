the use of high-pressure oxygen (hyperbaric oxygen) is showing promise as additional therapy for potentially deadly fungal infections.treatment is aggressive surgery, and high-dose antifungal chemotherapy with a drug such as amphotericin b can be life saving.they also have diminished cough and gag reflexes and faltering immune systems and are at greater risk for serious respiratory infections than are young and middle-aged adults.trials using such drugs may identify patients with neuralgia and help avoid unnecessary invasive treatments for chronic sinusitis.these antibiotics are also effective against many strains of s. pneumoniae and m. catarrhalis, but macrolide-resistance rates doubled between 1995 - 1999 as the number of children treated with the antibiotics increased.antibiotics and nasal corticosteroids are the main treatments for chronic sinusitis, but this condition is difficult to treat and does not always respond to these drugs.macrolides have anti-inflammatory actions, which may have benefits for some patients with chronic sinusitis.some studies have reported that, when combined with antibiotics, they speed recovery and improve healing rates of complicated or chronic sinusitis compared to antibiotics alone.for some people with chronic sinusitis, however, the condition is not curable, and the goal of treatment is to improve the quality of life.ct scans are useful for diagnosing chronic or recurrent acute sinusitis and for surgeons as a guide during surgery.nasal spray corticosteroids (commonly called steroids) are important for reducing the inflammatory response in the nasal passages and airways.a broad-spectrum antibiotic (one that can eliminate a wide range of bacteria) may be helpful.successful treatment of both allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis in children who also have asthma may reduce symptoms of asthma.they also are proving to be very important in the treatment of chronic sinusitis and are sometimes used for acute sinusitis.some patients with chronic sinusitis may need intravenous antibiotic therapy, particularly those with underlying medical disorders that can worsen their condition.
