nsaid-containing products, including hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, can lead to onset of new hypertension or worsening of preexisting hypertension, either of which may contribute to the increased incidence of cv events.
precautions general hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency.
nsaids inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients.
to minimize the potential risk for an adverse cv event in patients treated with an nsaid, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest duration possible.
nsaids, including hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen tablets, can cause serious gastrointestinal (gi) adverse events including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine, which can be fatal.
in this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of hydrocodone and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients.
to minimize the potential risk for an adverse gi event in patients treated with an nsaid, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration.
for the short-term (generally less than 10 days) management of acute pain, the recommended dose of hydrocodone bitartrate and ibuprofen is one tablet every 4 to 6 hours, as necessary.
other symptoms may include headache, dizziness, tinnitus, confusion, blurred vision, mental disturbances, skin rash, stomatitis, edema, reduced retinal sensitivity, corneal deposits, and hyperkalemia.
in severe overdosage, apnea, circulatory collapse, cardiac arrest and death may occur.
patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use nsaids have a greater than 10 fold increased risk for developing a gi bleed compared to patients with neither of these risk factors.
these serious adverse events can occur at any time, with or without warning symptoms, in patients treated with nsaids.
