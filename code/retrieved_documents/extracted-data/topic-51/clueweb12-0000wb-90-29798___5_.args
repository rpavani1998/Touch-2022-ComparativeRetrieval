fevers are actually helpful when the body has an infection because they make it more difficult for germs to live and multiply.it has long been believed that high fevers can cause brain damage, especially if left untreated.if an adult or child has a fever but feels okay, and is still able to perform daily activities or play, there is no reason to treat the fever.hyperthermia can be caused by overexposure to high temperatures and under consumption of water.in these cases, the body may not be able to regulate its temperature, and medications will not bring the temperature down.when an otherwise healthy person has a fever because of an illness, it is extremely unlikely to cause brain damage.the purpose of treating a fever is just to make the person more comfortable, not to eliminate the fever completely.brain and organ damage usually occur because of hyperthermia.unless the fever is caused by an outside source (hyperthermia) or there is already a neurological problem, there is almost no chance that the temperature will go this high.however, if the person is not feeling well enough to get out of bed or play, then it is fine to treat the fever with medication.a lukewarm bath may be helpful, but should only be tried after medication has been given to prevent the temperature from rapidly rising after getting out of the water.if a child has a fever and does not feel better about an hour after taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen (regardless of whether or not the temperature goes down), call his healthcare provider.the fever is actually your bodyâ€™s natural way of fighting off the illness.answer: most fevers are caused by viral or bacterial infections, but they can also be caused by toxins, cancers or autoimmune diseases.the only time the body will sustain damage due to a high temperature is when the body temperature goes over 107.6 degrees.
