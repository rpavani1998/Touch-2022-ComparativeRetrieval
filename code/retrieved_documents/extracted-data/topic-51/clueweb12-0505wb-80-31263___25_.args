in patients with primary dysmenorrhea, ibuprofen has been shown to reduce elevated levels of prostaglandin activity in the menstrual fluid and to reduce testing and active intrauterine pressure, as well as the frequency of uterine contractions.there is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious cv thrombotic events associated with nsaid use.clinical trials of several cox-2 selective and nonselective nsaids of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (cv) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal.cardiovascular effects cardiovascular thrombotic events clinical trials of several cox-2 selective and nonselective nsaids of up to three years duration have shown an increased risk of serious cardiovascular (cv) thrombotic events, myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal.gastrointestinal risk nsaids cause an increased risk of serious gastrointestinal adverse events including bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the stomach or intestines, which can be fatal.in these patients, administration of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug may cause a dose-dependent reduction in prostaglandin formation and, secondarily, in renal blood flow, which may precipitate overt renal decompensation.the use of aspirin in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma has been associated with severe bronchospasm, which can be fatal.the pharmacological activity of motrin suspension in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.nsaids inhibit platelet aggregation and have been shown to prolong bleeding time in some patients.other factors that increase the risk for gi bleeding in patients treated with nsaids include concomitant use of oral corticosteroids or anticoagulants, longer duration of nsaid therapy, smoking, use of alcohol, older age, and poor general health status.the effects of warfarin and nsaids on gi bleeding are synergistic, such that the users of both drugs together have a risk of serious gi bleeding higher than users of either drug alone.although serious cv events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms.although serious gi tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis.in patients with juvenile arthritis, doses above 50 mg/kg/day are not recommended because they have not been studied and doses exceeding the upper recommended dose of 40 mg/kg/day may increase the risk of causing serious adverse events.orally administered activated charcoal may help in reducing the absorption and reabsorption of ibuprofen.
