women with lupus are three times more likely than healthy women to develop preeclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure), which can be potentially life threatening.
in the majority of patients with sle, antinuclear antibodies (ana) are detectable.
the inflammatory process is a byproduct of the activity of the body's immune system, which fights infection and heals wounds and injuries: the infection fighters.
a very serious and rare condition called pulmonary hypertension occurs when high pressure develops as a result of damage to the blood vessels of the lungs.
a family history plays a strong role in sle.
swollen rash that itches, typically on scalp, arms, legs, or in the mouth dermatomyositis: bluish-red skin eruptions on face and upper body lyme disease: bulls-eye rash, joint inflammation, and flu-like symptoms back to top systemic lupus erythematosus (sle) can cause systemic complications throughout the body.
the first blood test ever used for sle called le (lupus erythematosus) cell test is positive in only about half of patients with sle and is no longer used that often.
a rare blood complication of sle that occurs primarily in asians is called acute lupus hemophagocytic syndrome.
lupus can cause complications in its early stages.
the immune system may perceive these altered skin cells as foreign and trigger an autoimmune response against them.
the effects on blood vessels have also been associated with confusion, headaches, and seizures.
in lupus, a complex interaction between activated immune cells and an impaired antigen-elimination process leads to a greater than normal range of what the antibodies recognize.
the blood is then returned.
sle affects the lungs in about 60% of patients: the kidneys are a crucial battleground in sle because it is here that the debris left over from the immune attacks is most likely to be deposited.
complement levels are especially low if there is kidney involvement or other disease activity.
however, many patients with discoid lupus do not respond to steroids, particularly if they have eruptions that are caused by sun sensitivity.

some research suggests that some patients, in fact, progress from one disease to the other, and that such transitions occur during major hormonal shifts, such as the onset of menopause or pregnancy.
a primary cause of death among patients with lupus is atherosclerosis, a disease of the coronary blood vessels resulting from accelerated buildup of plaque.
ivig is a blood product that contains these antibodies.
steroids can help relieve many of the complications and symptoms, including anemia and kidney involvement.
some autoantibodies are normal in a well-balanced immune system, and serve various roles to help the body dispose of wastes, protect from infectious invaders, and to keep blood vessels clear.
specific cytokines called interferons and interleukins play a critical role in sle by regulating the secretion of autoantibodies by b cells.
chronic stress has profound physical effects and influences the progression of sle.

about half of these lesions are photosensitive; that is, they are aggravated by ultraviolet (uv) radiation from sunlight, even from light coming through a window.
many prescription drugs can cause lupus-like skin symptoms.
other conditions, however, also cause high levels of ana, so a positive test is not a definite diagnosis for sle: a negative ana test makes a diagnosis of sle unlikely but not impossible.
light-to-moderate exercise, interspersed with rest periods, is good for the heart, helps fight depression and fatigue, and can help keep joints flexible.
