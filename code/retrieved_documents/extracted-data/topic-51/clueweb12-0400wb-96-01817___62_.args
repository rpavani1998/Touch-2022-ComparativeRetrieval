several clinical studies have reported that acupuncture therapy is effective in reducing the pain associated with post-herpetic neuralgia (phn).a small study showed potential benefit of a hypnotherapeutic treatment program for patients suffering from recurrent orofacial herpes infections.these drugs are used in patients who have undergone organ transplantation, but they are also often used for severe autoimmune diseases caused by the inflammatory process.once phn develops, a multidisciplinary approach that involves a pain specialist, psychiatrist, primary care physician, and other healthcare professionals may provide the best means to relieve the pain and distress associated with this condition.cognitive behavioral therapy is showing benefit in enhancing patients' beliefs in their own abilities for dealing with pain.for this reason, it is hypothesized that sunscreens may be capable of preventing uvb-induced reactivation of recurrent herpes labialis infection (prevention) in predisposed patients.administered intravenously (into the veins), the drug can have toxic effects, such as kidney damage (which is reversible) and seizures.all three of the antiviral treatments mentioned above have been proven to help shorten the amount of time that a person may experience symptoms of herpes.side effects of corticosteroids, including weight gain and lowered immunity, can be severe and oral steroids should be taken at as low a dose and for as short a time as possible.in rare cases, particularly in patients with impaired immune systems, these inflammations can be severe and even life-threatening.during an outbreak, symptomatic relief may be obtained by keeping the area clean and dry, or by taking pain relievers (such as aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen).the agent can have adverse effects, including serious allergic reactions, nausea, vomiting, flushing, and arrhythmias (irregular heart beat).blessed thistle is generally considered to be safe when taken by mouth in recommended doses for short periods of time, with few reported side effects such as birth defects, bleeding, breathing problems, bruising, cancer of the nose or throat, increased production of stomach acid, itching, kidney disease, liver toxicity, skin rash, stomach discomfort, stomach ulcers, and vomiting.hhv-6 infection is a major cause of opportunistic viral infections in patients with compromised immune systems, especially due to aids or organ transplants.sunscreens are known to prevent erythema and sunburn following exposure to uvb rays.
