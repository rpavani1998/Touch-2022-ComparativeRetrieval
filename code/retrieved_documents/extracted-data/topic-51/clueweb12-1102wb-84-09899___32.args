clinical factors, demographic variables, and variations in two genes — cyp2c9 (full name: cytochrome p450, subfamily 2, subfamily c, polypeptide 9) and vkorc1 (full name: vitamin k epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1) — contribute significantly to the variability among patients in dose requirements for warfarin.
in a study examining the management of acute coronary syndromes, clopidogrel was found to be marginally better than aspirin by only 2.1 percent.
because the retail cost of clopidogrel is at least 100 times greater than the cost of aspirin and is no better than aspirin in preventing a second heart attack or stroke, its use should be limited to those who cannot take aspirin.
warfarin reduces the blood’s ability to clot (coagulate) and prevents blood clots from forming in the arteries and veins.
patients also should be made aware of this drug interaction, since omeprazole is available over the counter without a prescription.
this is especially important for any surgery, including dental.

the nejm authors found that four drugs or drug classes were implicated alone or in combination in more than two-thirds of hospitalizations for adverse drug reactions: warfarin (coumadin, jantoven; 33.3 percent), insulins (13.9 percent), oral antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel [plavix] or aspirin; 13.3 percent) and oral hypoglycemic (diabetes) agents (10.7 percent).
an inr higher than that may increase the chance of bleeding, and a ratio lower than that may not protect patients from the clotting for which they are using the drug.
store at room temperature with lid on tightly.
no safety advantage was found for clopidogrel over aspirin plus esomeprazole in ulcer bleeding.
this risk has been found to increase tenfold in people taking 28 or more regular-strength acetaminophen tablets per week, or the equivalent of 18 or more extra-strength tablets per week, compared to those taking warfarin and no acetaminophen.

however, in statistically significant results, there were more patients with major bleeding episodes (defined as needing a transfusion of at least two units of blood) in those taking clopidogrel.
although the risk of bleeding in people taking warfarin cannot be completely reduced, even with optimal management, patients taking the drug are less likely to have bleeding problems if they follow dosage directions very carefully, and have their blood tested to measure the degree of clotting inhibition exactly as they have been advised.
especially serious episodes involve sites where irreversible damage mayu result from compression of vital structures (e.g., intracranial, pericardial, verve sheath, or spinal cord).
researchers have struggled to show that clopidogrel is better than aspirin in preventing certain cardiovascular incidents such as heart attack and stroke, and they have been largely unsuccessful in doing this.
sometimes, however, the bleeding is serious or life-threatening but can be difficult to detect, such as bleeding from the stomach or bleeding into the brain, especially when there is a smaller amount of bleeding that does not cause symptoms.
improved management of antithrombotic drugs [warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel] and antidiabetic drugs [especially insulin] has the potential to reduce hospitalizations for adverse drug events in older adults.”
results published from a prospective randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 45 patients found that acetaminophen (at a dose of 2 or 3 grams a day, administered for 10 days) increased the anticoagulant effect of warfarin in stable patients.
the u.k. medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) has received seven reports suggesting an interaction between warfarin and the dietary supplement glucosamine, according to the mhra and the u.k. committee on safety of medicines.
if blood clots form, they can break off from inside the blood vessel in which they formed and travel throughout the body, sometimes blocking blood flow within vital organs such as the lungs and brain.
pregnancy and breast-feeding warnings you should not take clopidogrel while nursing.
it also reduces the risk of death, recurrent heart attacks and stroke after a heart attack.
a person on stable doses of warfarin and thyroid replacement medication is not likely to have problems from the interaction.
what you can do make sure the person managing your warfarin therapy is fully aware of all of the medications you are taking, including prescription and over-the-counter medications and dietary supplements.
in fact, one of the most common serious warfarin drug interactions occurs when people on warfarin take common otc painkillers such as aspirin , ibuprofen (advil, medipren, motrin, nuprin), or naproxen (aleve, anaprox, naprosyn).

higher numbers indicate thinner blood, so the number increases with warfarin use.
* abstract background genetic variability among patients plays an important role in determining the dose of warfarin that should be used when oral anticoagulation is initiated, but practical methods of using genetic information have not been evaluated in a diverse and large population.
authors of a recently published study in the new england journal of medicine (nejm) found that “there were an estimated an estimated 99,628 emergency hospitalizations for adverse drug events in u.s. adults 65 years of age or older each year from 2007 through 2009.”
a recent study confirmed that antiplatelet medications such as aspirin or nsaids caused a substantial increase in serious stomach bleeding in people taking warfarin.
be very careful doing activities that may cause cuts or bleeding (such as shaving or cooking).
warfarin is also used in patients with abnormal heart rhythms such as atrial fibrillation, which can cause clots to form in the heart and then travel to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
although warfarin has saved many lives, its one big drawback is that, by reducing blood clotting, it increases the risk of bleeding.
tell any doctor, dentist, emergency medical technician, pharmacist or surgeon whose care you are under that you take clopidogrel.
the most common is when another medication throws a monkey wrench into the body’s normal machinery for getting rid of warfarin from the body (see table 2).
the thyroid-warfarin interaction is one of the most common of all drug interactions, and it is important to note that the risk of this interaction occurs primarily when thyroid medication is started, stopped or its dosage is adjusted.
while doctors sometimes use warfarin and aspirin together for additive blood thinning, it should only be done after careful consideration of the benefit versus risk balance, because the risk is clearly increased.
moreover, even different lots of the same brand may vary substantially as to content.
the nejm authors found that four drugs or drug classes were implicated alone or in combination in more than two-thirds of hospitalizations for adverse drug reactions: warfarin (coumadin, jantoven; 33.3 percent), insulins (13.9 percent), oral antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel

a person on stable doses of warfarin and thyroid replacement medication is not likely to have problems from the interaction.
patients also should be made aware of this drug interaction, since omeprazole is available over the counter without a prescription.
in some classes with multiple drugs, the interaction may have been reported for one but not all drugs in the class, but we include the interaction because the drugs in this class are similar to one another.

also, a large proportion of hospitalizations for adverse drug reactions do not occur through the emergency room, since many life-threatening reactions (such as liver toxicity, heart failure and other drug-induced diseases) may slowly worsen, leading to elective, not emergency, hospitalization.
this means that warfarin is being destroyed too fast so warfarin levels are reduced, the patient’s inr goes below the desired range, and the patient is more at risk of having a serious blood clot.
clopidogrel in research studies cardiovascular events.
keep in mind that dietary supplements are generally not standardized, so different brands may interact differently because the amount of active ingredient (and in some cases “inactive” ingredients) may not be the same.
the onset of symptoms is sudden and has occurred as soon as 24 hours after starting treatment with a fluoroquinolone.
other interactions may lower the inr below the desired range and thereby put the patient at risk of clotting.
another medication may either increase or decrease warfarin’s action (see “warfarin: interactions” box below).
platelets normally help prevent bleeding by sticking together and plugging up leaks in blood vessels.
the onset of symptoms is sudden and has occurred as soon as 24 hours after starting treatment with a fluoroquinolone.
poor metabolizers do not effectively convert plavix to its active form in the body.
combining warfarin with these painkillers increases the risk of serious stomach bleeding.
minimizing the risk of warfarin-induced bleeding, however, also requires that patients pay close attention to drug interactions because some of these can raise the international normalized ratio (inr; see box) into a range that is too high, with an unnecessarily increased risk of bleeding.
still other drugs can also affect the ability of the liver to manufacture these clotting factors.
do not use warfarin if you have or have had eclampsia or preeclampsia; blood disorders; or severe, uncontrolled high blood pressure.

sometimes, however, the bleeding is serious or life-threatening but can be difficult to detect, such as bleeding from the stomach or bleeding into the brain, especially when there is a smaller amount of bleeding that does not cause symptoms.
it is likely that thyroid replacement hormones act in this way.
if you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember, but skip it if it is almost time for the next dose.
this is especially important for any surgery, including dental.
other interactions may lower the inr below the desired range and thereby put the patient at risk of clotting.
in this study, 1 percent more patients taking clopidogrel had a major bleeding episode compared to the aspirin-treated patients, but there was no statistically significant difference between those taking clopidogrel or aspirin inregard to episodes of life-threatening bleeding.
this may be due to genetic factors that influence how the body metabolizes clopidogrel or the effect that certain other drugs (such as ppis) have on the effectiveness of clopidogrel.
before you use clopidogrel tell your doctor if you have or have had an allergy to this drug, bleeding problems, liver disease, stomach ulcers, recent surgery or trauma.

this can be just as dangerous as drug interactions that increase bleeding risk.
long-term clopidogrel may be no better than aspirin.
proper clotting involves both the production of chemicals called clotting factors (it is this process that warfarin inhibits) and the activity of small particles suspended in the blood called platelets.
acetaminophen may interact with warfarin to increase the risk of bleeding, a risk that rises with increasing doses of acetaminophen.
the risk of intracranial hemorrhage increases dramatically with an inr greater than 3, especially in older patients.
although the risk of bleeding in people taking warfarin cannot be completely reduced, even with optimal management, patients taking the drug are less likely to have bleeding problems if they follow dosage directions very carefully, and have their blood tested to measure the degree of clotting inhibition exactly as they have been advised.
therefore, the likelihood that dangerous clotting will occur decreases with these higher numbers.
the first step in avoiding bad interactions between warfarin and other drugs is never to start, stop or change the dosage of any prescription, non-prescription or alternative medication without informing the health professional who is managing your warfarin treatment.
some medications can interfere with the function of the blood’s platelets.
{the numbers for aspirin are really much lower, for if there is a bleeding episode, most doctors will blame it on aspirin, even when the patient is taking several other drugs.
in response to an action letter request by the fda, the manufacturer of clopidogrel revised the “precautions” section of the product label to include the following statement: “in patients with recent tia [transient ischemic attack] or stroke who are at high risk for recurrent ischemic events, the combination of aspirin and plavix has not been shown to be more effective than plavix alone, but the combination has been shown to increase major bleeding.”
many patients are prescribed drugs by several different health care professionals: general physicians, specialists, dentists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and others.

keep in mind that dietary supplements are generally not standardized, so different brands may interact differently because the amount of active ingredient (and in some cases “inactive” ingredients) may not be the same.
selected dietary supplements that may interact with warfarin possible increased risk of bleeding possible increased risk of clotting boldo chitosan danshen dong quai fenugreek feverfew ginkgo biloba quilinggao coenzyme q10 ginseng green tea st. john’s wort table 2.
the appropriate dose of warfarin is difficult to establish because it can vary by a factor of 10 among patients, and the consequences of receiving an incorrect dose can be catastrophic.
call your doctor if these symptoms continue: abdominal or stomach pain, anxiety, back pain, constipation, diarrhea, depression, dizziness, fever, chills, headache, heartburn, insomnia, itching, joint pain, leg cramps, muscle aches, nausea or vomiting, numbness or tingling or skin rash.
tell any doctor, dentist, emergency medical technician, pharmacist or surgeon whose care you are under that you take clopidogrel.
do not store in the bathroom.
the following drugs, biologics (e.g., vaccines, therapeutic antibodies) and foods are listed in evaluations of drug interactions 2003 as causing “highly clinically significant” or “clinically significant” interactions when used together with any of the drugs in clopidogrel’s class.
it is likely that thyroid replacement hormones act in this way.
signs of overdose if you suspect an overdose (see the signs below), call (800) 222-1222 to contact your poison control center: bleeding gums when brushing teeth nosebleeds unusually heavy bleeding from cuts or wounds unusually heavy or unexpected menstrual bleeding abdominal pain or swelling blood or material that looks like coffee grounds expelled when coughing or vomiting pinpoint red spots on skin interactions warfarin can interact with nearly all drugs and some dietary supplements.
worst pills best pills newsletter article december, 2007http://www.worstpills.org/member/newsletter.cfm?n_id=565 these days, prescription drugs often become popular after drug companies inundate health professionals and the public with advertising (especially on television).
other medications can have the opposite effect from the monkey wrench, and ramp up the warfarin-gobbling machinery into “turbo” mode.
a further analysis of the trial mentioned immediately above found that in patients with acute coronary syndrome who were taking aspirin, adding clopidogrel was beneficial, compared to a placebo, in reducing major cardiovascular events.
for some dietary supplements (such as ginkgo) the risk of bleeding may be increased, while other dietary supplements (such as st. john’s wort) may inhibit the blood thinning effect of warfarin and increase the risk of clotting.
because the retail cost of clopidogrel is at least 100 times greater than the cost of aspirin and is no better than aspirin in preventing a second heart attack or stroke, its use should be limited to those who cannot take aspirin.
however, in statistically significant results, there were more patients with major bleeding episodes (defined as needing a transfusion of at least two units of blood) in those taking clopidogrel.
results in the validation cohort, the pharmacogenetic algorithm accurately identified larger proportions of patients who required 21 mg of warfarin or less per week and of those who required 49 mg or more per week to achieve the target international normalized ratio than did the clinical algorithm (49.4% vs. 33.3%, p<0.001, among patients requiring 21 mg per week; and 24.8% vs. 7.2%, p<0.001, among those requiring 49 mg per week).
the only way a patient can be sure that the person managing their warfarin therapy will know all of his or her medications (prescription or not) is if the patient provides an up-to-date list of all of these drugs and/or dietary supplements.
for some dietary supplements (such as ginkgo) the risk of bleeding may be increased, while other dietary supplements (such as st. john’s wort) may inhibit the blood thinning effect of warfarin and increase the risk of clotting.
warfarin reduces the blood’s ability to clot (coagulate) and prevents blood clots from forming in the arteries and veins.
we also have included potentially serious interactions listed in the drug’s fda-approved product label or in published medical journal articles.
do not take any other drugs, including nonprescription products (aspirin, cold remedies, antacids, laxatives), or change the dose of drugs you are taking without consulting your doctor.
the most common is when another medication throws a monkey wrench into the body’s normal machinery for getting rid of warfarin from the body (see table 2).
also, an nejm study published on april 20, 2006, found that clopidogrel, when given in combination with aspirin, was overall no more effective than aspirin alone in reducing the rate of heart attacks, strokes or deaths from cardiovascular causes.
researchers have struggled to show that clopidogrel is better than aspirin in preventing certain cardiovascular incidents such as heart attack and stroke, and they have been largely unsuccessful in doing this.
in this trial, clopidogrel was directly compared to aspirin.
results published from a prospective randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 45 patients found that acetaminophen (at a dose of 2 or 3 grams a day, administered for 10 days) increased the anticoagulant effect of warfarin in stable patients.
a good example is the commonly used antibiotic with the unwieldy name,  trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (bactrim, cotrim, septra); it can dramatically increase the blood-thinning effects of warfarin and increase bleeding risk.
combining warfarin with these painkillers increases the risk of serious stomach bleeding.
a study published in 2008, investigating the effect of the heartburn drug omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor [ppi]) on the action of clopidogrel plus aspirin therapy, found that omeprazole significantly decreased the effect of clopidogrel, meaning that clopidogrel could then be less effective in preventing strokes and heart attacks.
published medical literature shows that clopidogrel is less effective in some patients than it is in others.
there may be other drugs, especially those in the families of the drugs listed below, that also will react with this drug to cause severe adverse effects.
if you plan to have any surgery, including dental, tell your doctor that you take this drug.
inform health care professionals that tests are available to identify genetic differences in cyp2c19 function.
acute coronary syndrome consists of unstable chest pain (angina) and changes in the electrocardiogram (ekg or ecg) that suggest a heart attack.
in addition, the drug is used to prevent second heart attacks in some patients who have already had one, to prevent clots in patients with artificial heart valves and to treat a number of other blood clotting problems.
a study published in 2008, investigating the effect of the heartburn drug omeprazole (a proton pump inhibitor [ppi]) on the action of clopidogrel plus aspirin therapy, found that omeprazole significantly decreased the effect of clopidogrel, meaning that clopidogrel could then be less effective in preventing strokes and heart attacks.
bleeding is the major toxicity of orgal anticoagulant drugs.
ttp is a life-threatening adverse effect that is characterized by a breakdown of red blood cells, low levels of cells that help stop bleeding (platelets), fever, mental changes and kidney problems.
{the numbers for aspirin are really much lower, for if there is a bleeding episode, most doctors will blame it on aspirin, even when the patient is taking several other drugs.
do not drink alcohol.
if these clots travel to the lungs, they can cause what is known as a pulmonary embolism, which is frequently fatal.
unless the blood is tested and the warfarin dose is adjusted accordingly, warfarin will accumulate, the blood will become too thin and bleeding may result.
however, it has been noted that beyond 30 days, there was no significant advantage to treatment with clopidogrel over a placebo in regard to cardiovascular death or nonfatal heart attack.
the only way a patient can be sure that the person managing their warfarin therapy will know all of his or her medications (prescription or not) is if the patient provides an up-to-date list of all of these drugs and/or dietary supplements.
it should be noted that many adverse-reaction deaths occur at home, such as those seen with darvon, wherein patients, especially older adults, were found dead from the drug’s heart-toxic effects.
keep in mind that serious bleeding is uncommon, and as long as clotting has not been slowed too much, the benefit of warfarin for well-established indications often outweighs the risks.
this means that warfarin is being destroyed too fast so warfarin levels are reduced, the patient’s inr goes below the desired range, and the patient is more at risk of having a serious blood clot.
