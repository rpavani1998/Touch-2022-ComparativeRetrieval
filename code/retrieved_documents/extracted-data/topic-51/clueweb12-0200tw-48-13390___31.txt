in general, for adults, doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis,[74] with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever.[75] for the prevention of myocardial infarction in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, much lower doses are taken once daily.[74] new recommendations from the us preventive services task force (uspstf, march, 2009) on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction inmyocardial infarction (mi) for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage.[76] the whi study said regular low dose (75 or 81 mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause.[76] low dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81 mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for patients requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.[76] in children with kawasaki disease, aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight, initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks.[77

thus, the protective anticoagulative effect ofpgi2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems.
aspirin is also used in the treatment of pericarditis, coronary artery  disease, and acute myocardial infarction.[44][45][46] taking aspirin before air travel in cramped conditions has been suggested  to decrease the risk ofdeep-vein thrombosis (dvt).
chronic  overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%;[verification  needed] chronic overdose may be especially severe in children.[103]  toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, includingactivated  charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and  dialysis.[104]

this reduced leukocyte adhesion, which is an important step in immune response to infection; however, there is currently insufficient evidence to show that aspirin helps to fight infection.[124] more recent data also suggests that salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling throughnf-κb.[125] nf-κb, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.

with large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first order to zero order, asmetabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important.[132] salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (< 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid.[133] when small doses (less than 250 mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 to 4.5 hours.

however, recent research suggests the high death toll of the 1918 flu was  partly due to aspirin, as the doses used at times can lead to toxicity, fluid  in the lungs, and, in some cases, contribute to secondary bacterial infections  and mortality.[147] aspirin's profitability led to fierce competition and the  proliferation of aspirin brands and products, especially after the american  patent held by bayer expired in 1917.[148][149]

for both males and females diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, aspirin reduces the chance of a heart attack and ischaemic stroke by about a fifth.[citation needed] this translates to an absolute rate reduction from 8.2% to 6.7% of such events per year for people already with cardiovascular disease.[citation needed] although aspirin also raises the risk ofhemorrhagic stroke and other major bleeds by about twofold, these events are rare, and the balance of aspirin's effects is positive.

both dogs and horses are susceptible to the gastrointestinal side-effects associated with salicylates, but it is a convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs and has shown some promise in cases oflaminitis in horses.[161][162] aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of aveterinarian; in particular,cats lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making even low doses potentially toxic.[163]

in the 1960s and 1970s, john vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects, while clinical trials and other studies from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anticlotting agent that reduces the risk of clotting diseases.[151] aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the 20th century, and remain strong in the 21st century, because of its widespread use as a preventive treatment forheart attacks and strokes.[152] [edit] trademark as part of war reparations specified in the 1919 treaty of versailles following germany's surrender afterworld war i, aspirin (along with heroin) lost its status as a registered trademark infrance, russia, the united kingdom, and theunited states, where it became a generic name.[153][154][155] today, "aspirin" is a generic word in australia, france, india, ireland, new zealand,pakistan, jamaica, colombia, the philippines, south africa, united kingdom and the united states.[156] aspirin, with a capital "a", remains a registered trademark of bayer in germany, canada, mexico, and in over 80 other countries, where the trademark is owned bybayer, using acetylsalicylic acid in all markets, but using different packaging and physical aspects for each.[157][158] [edit] compendial status - united states pharmacopeia

with large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first  order to zero order, asmetabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion  becomes increasingly important.[132] salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%),  free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (< 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid.[133] when small doses  (less than 250 mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by  first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 to 4.5 hours.
in children and adolescents, aspirin is no longer indicated to control flu-like symptoms or the symptoms of chickenpox or other viral illnesses, because of the risk ofreye's syndrome.[6] aspirin is part of a group of medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids), but differs from them in the mechanism of action.

this antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the  incidence of heart attacks.[121] 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit  a large proportion of maximum thromboxane a2 release provoked acutely, with the  prostaglandin i2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of  aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.[122] prostaglandins are local hormones produced in the body and have diverse  effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain,  modulation of thehypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation.
in addition, aspirin induces the  formation of no-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an  independent mechanism of reducing inflammation.

this reduced leukocyte  adhesion, which is an important step in immune response to infection; however,  there is currently insufficient evidence to show that aspirin helps to fight  infection.[124] more recent data also suggests that salicylic acid and its  derivatives modulate signaling throughnf-κb.[125] nf-κb, a  transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological  processes, including inflammation.

in comparison, there was  an estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction of 137 events per  10.000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10.000 persons in ischemic  stroke.[99] in cases where ich already has occurred, aspirin use results in  higher mortality, with a dose of approximately 250 mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within three months after the ich of approximately 2.5  (95%confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6).[100] aspirin and other nsaids can cause hyperkalemia by inducing a hyporenin  hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however,  these agents do not typically causehyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of  normal renal function and euvolemic state.[101] aspirin can cause prolonged bleeding after operations for up to 10 days.

aspirin was found to have a  protective effect on hepatocytes because it led to the "downregulation of  proinflammatory cytokines".[64] in another 2009 article published by the journal of the american medical  association, men and women who regularly took aspirin after colorectal cancer  diagnosis were found to have lower risks of overall and colorectal cancer death  compared to patients not using aspirin.[65] a 2010 article in the journal of clinical oncology has suggested aspirin  may reduce the risk of death from breast cancer.[66] while the information has  been well-circulated by the media,[67][68] official health bodies and medical  groups have expressed concern over the touting of aspirin as a "miracle  drug".[69] a 2010 study by oxford university involving over 25000 patients showed  taking a small (75 mg) daily dose of aspirin for between four and eight  years substantially reduces death rates from a range of common cancers by at  least a fifth and the reduction of risk continued for 20 years in both men and  women.
the authors concluded ibuprofen has the best risk-benefit ratio.[15] aspirin did not ease pain during cycling exercise,[16] while caffeine was very effective.[17][18] likewise, aspirin, codeine, or paracetamol was not better than placebo for muscle soreness after exercise.[19] [edit] headache aspirin is a first-line drug in the treatment of migraine, bringing relief in 50–60% of the cases.[20] when used at a high dose of 1000 mg (as compared to 275–325 mg when used as a pain killer or 81 mg as an antiplatelet therapy), no significant differences were seen as compared to triptan medication, sumatriptan (imitrex)[21] and other painkillers such as paracetamol (acetaminophen)[22] or ibuprofen.[23] the combination of aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen) andcaffeine (as found in the otc brand excedrin) is even more potent.

in comparison, there was an estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction of 137 events per 10.000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10.000 persons in ischemic stroke.[99] in cases where ich already has occurred, aspirin use results in higher mortality, with a dose of approximately 250 mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within three months after the ich of approximately 2.5 (95%confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6).[100] aspirin and other nsaids can cause hyperkalemia by inducing a hyporenin hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically causehyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state.[101] aspirin can cause prolonged bleeding after operations for up to 10 days.

the maximum dose of aspirin (1 g)  provides weaker pain relief than an intermediate dose of ibuprofen  (400 mg), and this relief does not last as long.[12] a combination of  aspirin and codeine may have a slightly higher analgesic effect than aspirin  alone; however, this difference is not clinically meaningful.[13] it appears  ibuprofen is at least equally, and possibly more, effective than this  combination.[14
