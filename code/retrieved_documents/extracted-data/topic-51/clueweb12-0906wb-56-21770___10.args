it is not advisable to try to lower the body temperature before consulting a physician (i.e. by taking a cold shower).
consult a physician about a fever if: in addition, consult a physician immediately if any of these signs and symptoms accompany a fever: to check body temperature, several types of thermometers are available, including electronic thermometers and ear (tympanic) thermometers.
the thermometer is then removed and the temperature read.
therefore a person with a fever will not sweat, even though body temperature is higher than normal, until a fever "breaks" (starts to resolve).

the "normal" temperature taken by mouth can range from about 97 °f (36.1 °c) to 99.9 °f (37.7 °c).[3] normal body temperature is regulated by several areas in the brain and nervous system, including the hypothalamus, an area at the base of the brain that acts as a thermostat for the body.[2] in a healthy individual, anything that results in a rise in body temperature, for example exercising, causes the regulatory system to activate body mechanisms, such as sweating, to reduce the temperature back to normal.

use a rectal thermometer for infants as follows: place a dab of petroleum jelly on the bulb of the thermometer.
thermometers with digital readouts and those that take the temperature quickly from the ear canal are especially useful for young children and older adults.
a fever isn't an illness itself, but an indication that something out of the ordinary is going on in the body.
if the body temperature is higher than 100.9 °f (38.3 °c) for more than three weeks and the doctor isn't able to find the cause after extensive evaluation, the diagnosis may befever of unknown origin.[6] [7] in most cases, though, the cause of the fever can be found and treated.

thermometers with digital readouts and those that take the temperature quickly from the ear canal are especially useful for young children and older adults.
at bedtime, use a sheet or light blanket.
the pathways appear to be complex and involve a number of other chemicals such as prostaglandin e2.[2] exogenous pyrogens are components of microorganisms that trigger an inflammatory response, which includes a fever.
instead, dress in comfortable, light clothing and try bathing in lukewarm water.
in infants and children younger than two years of age, these may be signs ofmeningitis, an infection and inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
shivering actually raises the body's internal temperature (shaking muscles generate heat).
for fever above 104 °f (40 °c) use a five- to ten-minute sponge bath of lukewarm water to try to bring the high temperature down.
adults may also use aspirin.
sometimes, older children can have a lower-than-normal temperature.
a fever almost never rises above 105.8 °f (41 °c) to 107.6 °f (42 °c) in humans.[5] fever can be a side effect of some medications such as antibiotics and drugs used to treathigh blood pressure or seizures.
because a fever can occur with many different conditions, other signs and symptoms can often help identify the cause.
if the fever doesn't get better or the child has a febrile seizure, seek immediate medical care.
