tetracycline antibiotics, such as doxycycline, may have a role to play in treating osteoarthritis.no treatment can cure osteoarthritis, and none can alter its progression with certainty, but many available treatments can relieve symptoms and significantly improve the quality of life.it may provide more stability, a faster recovery, and greater range of motion, making it a potentially good option for young, physically active patients.in any case, acupuncture appears to be a safe and beneficial addition to standard therapy for certain patients, such as pregnant women, who cannot take most pain medications.because long-term use of corticosteroids has many potentially serious side effects, steroid medications are never given by mouth or systemically for the treatment of osteoarthritis.complementary medicine: acupuncture appears to be a safe and may be a helpful addition to standard therapy for some patients, such as pregnant women, who cannot take most pain medications.narcotics, pain-relieving and sleep-inducing drugs that act on the central nervous system, are the most powerful medications available for the management of moderate-to-severe pain.these drugs help reduce nsaid-induced ulcer rates by as much as 80% compared with no treatment.while full recovery may take older patients longer than younger people, the long-term outcome of the surgery is excellent, and leads to significant improvements in pain and quality of life.hyaluronic injections appear to be about as effective as nsaids and corticosteroid shots for relieving pain, at least in men, and they have no adverse effects in the stomach or intestines.the negative effects of osteoarthritis on activities and physical and mental health are significant regardless of age, educational level, or gender.proper treatment of injuries, such as surgical repair of ligament tears in the knee with a strong rehabilitation approach, may help prevent the development of osteoarthritis.a moderate exercise program that includes low-impact aerobics and power and strength training has benefits for osteoarthritic patients, even if exercise does not slow down the disease progression.just like a drug, herbs and supplements can affect the body's chemistry, and therefore have the potential to produce side effects that may be harmful.osteoarthritis itself is not life threatening, but a person's quality of life can significantly deteriorate as a result of pain and lost mobility.
