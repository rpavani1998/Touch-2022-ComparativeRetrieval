antihistamines have an important role in treating allergy reactions, such as hay fever or seasonal allergy problems.this is the reason many healthcare workers choose to use individual medicines as needed rather than a compound medicine-it is much easier to treat and adjust the symptoms to the patients needs when single medicines are used.people of any age can become dehydrated, but dehydration develops more quickly and is most dangerous in small children.the patients infected with avian influenza (h5n1) have had symptoms of cough ,diarrhea, fever, sore throat, pneumonia and acute repiratory distress syndrome (ards).aspirin use during illness with colds, flu or chicken pox has been assosciated with the development of reyes syndrome, a frequently fatal disease.even after tylenol administration it is unusual but possible for the fever to rise higher and need additional treatment may be needed.because of this, most physicans now recommend that we balance the risks and benefits of fever by only treating and attempting to reduce fevers greater than 101 degrees f, 38.33 degrees c. fever can increase the need for oxygen.the human body needs water to maintain enough blood and other fluids to function properly.the main danger from fever is rapid dehydration-treating a fever reduces the chance that a febrile seizure will occur.if emergency medical services/ emergency department care is available, most physicians would consider seizures a reason to call for ambulance transport to the hospital for evaluation.some children will have febrile seizures- grand mal or tonic-clonic type seizures brought on by a rapid rise in body temperature.in fact, it may serve an important purpose- most bacteria and viruses that infect humans find it hard to replicate at higher than normal human body temperatures.that way you can treat symptoms as needed, rather than using a shotgun approach when only one symptom is what you are targeting.it might result in a dangerous overdose of the medicine.
