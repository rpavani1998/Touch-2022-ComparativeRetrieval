long-term control medications are essential to minimize long-term damage of the inflammatory response, to reduce the risk of serious exacerbations, and to enhance the overall function and well-being of patients with asthma.taking a corticosteroid drug through an inhaler makes it possible to provide effective local anti inflammatory activity in the lungs with very few side effects elsewhere in the body.asthma death rates have steadily declined and asthma is now only rarely fatal in children even low mortality numbers are unacceptable, however, since asthma deaths are largely preventable.the overuse of bronchodilators can have serious consequences; not using steroids can lead to permanent lung damage.they can be dangerous when used alone, because they can mask asthma symptoms, and they can increase the risk of asthma death unless paired with an inhaled steroid.the goal of asthma therapy is to maximize long-term control of the illness with medications and other treatment approaches, thereby minimizing the frequency of asthma symptoms and asthma attacks.in about 5% of cases, aspirin is responsible for a syndrome that involves multiple attacks of asthma, sinusitis, and nasal congestion.just like a drug, herbs and supplements can affect the body's chemistry, and therefore have the potential to produce side effects that may be harmful.the use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma reduces the risk of rehospitalization and death from asthma.children adapt well to living with asthma, and even with severe asthma they can function as well as healthy children in virtually all areas of life.breathing exercises may help improve patients’ quality of life even if they do not have a major impact on medication reduction.asthma action plans create a written document for patients and parents to manage asthma during stable times and to more easily identify when asthma is worsening.beta2-agonists serve as bronchodilators, relaxing and opening constricted airways during an acute asthma attack.immunotherapy poses some risk for severe allergic reactions, especially for children with poorly controlled asthma, so it is important that the doctor carefully evaluates the child’s asthma condition.if asthma continues to worsen with the use of these drugs, a doctor may prescribe corticosteroids or other drugs to treat underlying inflammation.
