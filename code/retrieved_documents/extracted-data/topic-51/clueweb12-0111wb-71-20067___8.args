aspirin can trigger a serious, often fatal sickness called reye's syndrome in young people recovering from chicken pox or the flu.
it's swallowed to prevent heart attacks and taken to relieve headaches, fever, rheumatism, arthritis, inflammation, hangovers, and other disorders, real and imagined.
as little as 10 grams -- about 30 regular-strength tablets -- can be fatal in adults.
you'd have seen migraines pampered and vanquished, and arthritis pain formulized out of existence.
some experts say a good way to take aspirin is to crush it and mix it with orange juice or honey and lemon to reduce stomach irritation and permit faster absorption.
other problems even when taken as directed, aspirin still stirs up problems for some people.
its ability to relieve pain is unequaled even by many highly-touted prescription drugs.
but unlike the "magic" of placebos, the magic of aspirin resides in the aspirin molecule itself.
aspirin interferes with many types of medication, including drugs taken for gout, diabetes, and kidney disease.
acetaminophen reduces fever and pain, but doesn't ease inflammation.
you'd have seen it rush to where it hurts five times faster while it was twice as gentle to your stomach, unclanging bell-ringer headaches as it neutralized neuritis, neuralgia, and a long list of muscular aches and pains.
on the other hand, acetaminophen causes less stomach upset.
other points to keep in mind: don't take aspirin on an empty stomach, and be sure to wash it down with a glass of water.
because in that short time, you would have seen aspirin buffered and time-released, extra-strengthed and effervesced, in a dozen different forms in a dozen different commercials.
just consider these, for starters: for some users, aspirin can cause ringing in the ears, dizziness, vomiting, and hearing loss.

and although it's safe and cheap and effective, it can be dangerous -- even deadly -- when used incorrectly or in larger-than-recommended doses.
its ability to relieve pain is unequaled even by many highly-touted prescription drugs.
and despite its use as a hangover cure, aspirin is even more irritating to the stomach when used with alcohol.
as with any other drug, users should also be careful about interactions with other drugs.
because aspirin can disrupt normal blood clotting and cause bleeding, it should be avoided at least one week prior to surgery and during pregnancy.
..consumer, be wise pointing out its possible risks isn't meant to turn people away from moderate aspirin use.
at high levels, prostaglandins cause pain -- and aspirin just eats up pain.
in addition, regular aspirin use may increase risks of bleeding stroke, which is more often fatal than ischemic stroke.
children and teenagers are also better off with substitutes.
and although it's safe and cheap and effective, it can be dangerous -- even deadly -- when used incorrectly or in larger-than-recommended doses.
aspirin really is a wonder drug -- as effective at stopping pain as many prescription analgesics, and its beneficial effects on health only make it that much more of a boon than it has been all along.
in fact, evidence of the drug's dangers in pregnancy -- including prolonged labor, heavier bleeding, and abnormal clotting in mother and child -- has prompted federal officials to recommend warning labels for all aspirin products.
the alternative can be every bit as deadly as a heart attack.
the most common effect of overuse is stomach upset -- from pain and nausea to bleeding ulcers and chronic indigestion.
but no matter what form you buy or where you find it, all aspirin works in the same way: by blocking production of hormone-like chemicals (called prostaglandins) involved in everything from blood circulation and clotting to body temperature, digestion, and breathing.
acetaminophen reduces fever and pain, but doesn't ease inflammation.

beyond its role as a pain reliever, aspirin is showing value in preventing ischemic (clotting) strokes and in slowing the formation of cataracts.
other problems even when taken as directed, aspirin still stirs up problems for some people.

relief begins within minutes; peak effect is reached in about two hours.
should none of these over-the-counter drugs satisfactorily reduce discomfort, pain may be a sign of a more serious problem warranting a doctor's attention.

when you buy expensive brands, the extra money pays for advertising -- not "faster" or "better" pain relief.
and despite its use as a hangover cure, aspirin is even more irritating to the stomach when used with alcohol.
researchers at harvard medical school concluded a six-year study by saying that healthy men over age 50 can cut their heart attack risk in half by taking a single aspirin, every other day.
just about the only thing aspirin lacks is the "magic" that occurs when a doctor writes a prescription for an expensive prescription drug.

overuse, overdose still, the greatest danger of overuse is overdose.
aspirin interferes with many types of medication, including drugs taken for gout, diabetes, and kidney disease.
as little as 10 grams -- about 30 regular-strength tablets -- can be fatal in adults.
there's no evidence that gulping more aspirin more often will improve your chances of avoiding a heart attack.
a reason aspirin ranks so high is simple availability.
regular aspirin use also damages the kidneys and can trigger sudden renal failure.
perhaps even more important is the drug's role in preventing heart attack by slowing development of blood clots in arteries leading to the heart.
because in spite of the enormity of aspirin use, most of us know less about it than any other drug.
but for best results, it's important to use aspirin only as directed.

this "magic" relieves pain about half the time -- even when the contents of the capsule are only sugar.

because of the risks, aspirin makers are required by law to add warning labels about reye's syndrome to product packages.

it's available wherever you might happen to be: grocery and drug stores, gas stations, airports, restaurants, glove compartments, purses, and desk drawers.
its effects are also altered by vitamin c, which slows elimination of the drug from the body, and by alcohol.
a bottle is always around somewhere, waiting to be downed by a curious child (aspirin is still a leading cause of poisoning in kids) or by adults who think that if a little aspirin makes them feel better, a lot will make them feel wonderful.
it works like aspirin to block both fever and swelling and may work better against certain types of pain, like menstrual cramps.
for more severe pain, a physician can prescribe other preparations, including narcotics and synthetic pain relievers.
