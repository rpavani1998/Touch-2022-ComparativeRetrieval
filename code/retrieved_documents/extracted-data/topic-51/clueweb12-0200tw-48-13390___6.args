while much of it is attributable to diet, a substantial part is synthesizedendogenously.[2] aspirin also has an antiplatelet effect by inhibiting the production of thromboxane, which under normal circumstances binds platelet molecules together
saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity.
thus, in the primary prevention trials, aspirin did not change the overall mortality rate.[34] further trials are in progress[update].[34]
"low dose of aspirin keeps migraine away".
advertisement for aspirin, heroin, lycetol, and salophen six years later, in 1859, von gilm obtained analytically pure acetylsalicylic acid (which he calledacetylierte salicylsäure, acetylated salicylic acid) by a reaction of salicylic acid and acetyl chloride.
in their experiment, scientists from yale university and the university of iowa induced damage in certain liver cells (hepatocytes) using excessive doses of acetaminophen.
for the treatment of migraine headache, this formulation works better than any of its three components taken separately,[22] better than ibuprofen[24] and better than sumatriptan.
although some enteric coated formulations of aspirin are advertised as being "gentle to the stomach", in one study enteric coating did not seem to reduce this risk.[85] combining aspirin with other nsaids has also been shown to further increase this risk.[85] using aspirin in combination with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.[86]
as with all other medications for migraine, it is recommended to take aspirin at the first signs of the headache, and it is the way these medications were used in the comparative clinical trials.[25] aspirin alleviates pain in 60–75% of patients with episodic tension headaches.[26][27] it is equivalent to paracetamol (acetaminophen) in that respect, except for the higher frequency of gastrointestinal side-effects.[27] comparative clinical trials indicatedmetamizole and ibuprofen may relieve pain faster than aspirin, although the difference becomes insignificant after about two hours.
owing to the issue of solubility, however, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, andplasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.[130][131][132] about 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is bound by protein, while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent.
this antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks.[121] 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane a2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin i2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.[122] prostaglandins are local hormones produced in the body and have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of thehypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation.
chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%;[verification needed] chronic overdose may be especially severe in children.[103] toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, includingactivated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis.[104] the diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods.
after vascular surgery of the lower legs using artificial grafts that are sutured to the arteries to improve blood supply, aspirin is used to keep the grafts open because it serves as type of blood thinner, reducing the likelihood of clots forming.
significance of measurements of salicylate in blood in cases of acute ingestion".
low-dose, long-term aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of thromboxane a2 in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation.
in comparison, there was an estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction of 137 events per 10.000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10.000 persons in ischemic stroke.[99] in cases where ich already has occurred, aspirin use results in higher mortality, with a dose of approximately 250 mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within three months after the ich of approximately 2.5 (95%confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6).[100] aspirin and other nsaids can cause hyperkalemia by inducing a hyporenin hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically causehyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state.[101] aspirin can cause prolonged bleeding after operations for up to 10 days.

the effects of aspirin were indistinguishable from those obtained using paracetamol in any respect, except for, possibly, a slightly higher incidence of sweating and gastrointestinal side-effects.[37] fever and joint pain of acute rheumatic fever respond extremely well, often within three days, to high doses of aspirin.
aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where anacetyl group is covalently attached to a serine residue in the active site of the ptgs enzyme.

the authors concluded ibuprofen has the best risk-benefit ratio.[15] aspirin did not ease pain during cycling exercise,[16] while caffeine was very effective.[17][18] likewise, aspirin, codeine, or paracetamol was not better than placebo for muscle soreness after exercise.[19] [edit] headache aspirin is a first-line drug in the treatment of migraine, bringing relief in 50–60% of the cases.[20] when used at a high dose of 1000 mg (as compared to 275–325 mg when used as a pain killer or 81 mg as an antiplatelet therapy), no significant differences were seen as compared to triptan medication, sumatriptan (imitrex)[21] and other painkillers such as paracetamol (acetaminophen)[22] or ibuprofen.[23] the combination of aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen) andcaffeine (as found in the otc brand excedrin) is even more potent.
this method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.[113] - - reaction mechanism - formulations containing high concentrations of aspirin often smell like vinegar[114] because aspirin can decompose through hydrolysis in moist conditions, yielding salicylic acid andacetic acid.[115] the acid dissociation constant (pka) for acetylsalicylic acid is 3.5 at 25 °c (77 °f).[116] [edit] polymorphism polymorphism, or the ability of a substance to form more than one crystal structure, is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients.

owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people withpeptic ulcers, mild diabetes , orgastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin.[78][82] even if none of these conditions is present, there is still an increased risk ofstomach bleeding when aspirin is taken withalcohol or warfarin.[78][79] patients with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates.[78]
[ 82] aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic diseaseglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (g6pd), in particular in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease.[83] use of aspirin duringdengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency.[84] people withkidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excreteuric acid, and thus may exacerbate these conditions.
the father of modern medicine,hippocrates, who lived sometime between 460 bc and 377 bc, left historical records describing the use of powder made from the bark and leaves of the willow tree to help these symptoms.[139] a french chemist, charles frederic gerhardt, was the first to prepare acetylsalicylic acid in 1853.
however, recent research suggests the high death toll of the 1918 flu was partly due to aspirin, as the doses used at times can lead to toxicity, fluid in the lungs, and, in some cases, contribute to secondary bacterial infections and mortality.[147] aspirin's profitability led to fierce competition and the proliferation of aspirin brands and products, especially after the american patent held by bayer expired in 1917.[148][149]
[ 12] nevertheless, as a postsurgery painkiller, aspirin is inferior to ibuprofen and has higher gastrointestinal toxicity.

[ 96] aspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral microbleeds having the appearance onmri scans of 5–10 mm or smaller hypointense (dark holes) patches.[97][98] such cerebral microbleeds are important since they often occur prior toischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage, binswanger disease and alzheimer's disease.[original research?]
acetylsalicylic acid is stable in dry air, but graduallyhydrolyses in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylicacids.
the form ii is only stable at 100k and reverts to form i at ambient temperature.
in addition, the risks of hemorrhagic strokes and gastrointestinal bleeding almost completely offset the benefits of aspirin.
thus, in secondary prevention trials, aspirin reduced the overall mortality by about a tenth.[34]

because the platelet patch can become too large and also block blood flow, locally and downstream, aspirin is also used long-term, at low doses, to help preventheart attacks, strokes, and blood clot formation in people at high risk of developing blood clots.[3]
on the other hand, antithrombotic trialists’ collaboration argued such recommendations are unjustified, since the relative reduction of risk in the primary prevention trials of aspirin was same for persons in high- and low-risk groups and did not depend on the blood pressure.
heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acutemyocardial infarction.
aspirin was found to have a protective effect on hepatocytes because it led to the "downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines".[64] in another 2009 article published by the journal of the american medical association, men and women who regularly took aspirin after colorectal cancer diagnosis were found to have lower risks of overall and colorectal cancer death compared to patients not using aspirin.[65] a 2010 article in the journal of clinical oncology has suggested aspirin may reduce the risk of death from breast cancer.[66] while the information has been well-circulated by the media,[67][68] official health bodies and medical groups have expressed concern over the touting of aspirin as a "miracle drug".[69] a 2010 study by oxford university involving over 25000 patients showed taking a small (75 mg) daily dose of aspirin for between four and eight years substantially reduces death rates from a range of common cancers by at least a fifth and the reduction of risk continued for 20 years in both men and women.

the increased ph and larger surface area of thesmall intestine causes aspirin to be absorbed rapidly there, which in turn allows more of the salicylate to dissolve.
for both males and females diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, aspirin reduces the chance of a heart attack and ischaemic stroke by about a fifth.[citation needed] this translates to an absolute rate reduction from 8.2% to 6.7% of such events per year for people already with cardiovascular disease.[citation needed] although aspirin also raises the risk ofhemorrhagic stroke and other major bleeds by about twofold, these events are rare, and the balance of aspirin's effects is positive.
acetylsalicylic acid is poorly soluble in the acidic conditions of the stomach, which can delay absorption of high doses for eight to 24 hours.

does so in an irreversible manner and, unlike others, affect more the cox-1 variant than the cox-2 variant of the enzyme.[7] for example, nsaids' antiplatelet effects normally last in the order of hours, whereas aspirin's effects last for days (until the body replaces the suppressed platelets).
they were first to assign to it the correct structure with the acetyl group connected to the phenolic oxygen.[142] in 1897, chemists working at bayer ag produced a synthetically altered version ofsalicin, derived from the species meadowsweet (filipendula ulmaria), which caused less digestive upset than puresalicylic acid.
this reduced leukocyte adhesion, which is an important step in immune response to infection; however, there is currently insufficient evidence to show that aspirin helps to fight infection.[124] more recent data also suggests that salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling throughnf-κb.[125] nf-κb, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.
on the other hand, antithrombotic trialists’ collaboration argued such recommendations are unjustified, since the relative reduction of risk in the primary prevention trials of aspirin was same for persons in high- and low-risk groups and did not depend on the blood pressure.
this caused hepatoxicity and hepatocyte death, which triggered an increase in the production oftlr9.
with large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first order to zero order, asmetabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important.[132] salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (< 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid.[133] when small doses (less than 250 mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 to 4.5 hours.

however, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these patients; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another nsaid-induced drug when angioedema appeared.
[edit] effects upon hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity aspirin, like other medications affecting prostaglandin synthesis, has profound effects on thepituitary gland, which indirectly affects a number of other hormones and physiological functions.
main article: history of aspirin 1923 advertisement plant extracts, including willow bark and spiraea, of which salicylic acid was the active ingredient, had been known to help alleviate headaches, pains, and fevers since antiquity.
after fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin treatment is unnecessary, as it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease.[39]
thus, in secondary prevention trials, aspirin reduced the overall mortality by about a tenth.[34]
in several studies, its use did not reduce the incidence of prostate cancer.[49][50] its effects on the incidence of pancreatic cancer are mixed; one study published in 2004 found a statistically significant increase in the risk of pancreatic cancer among women,[51] while a meta-analysis of several studies, published in 2006, found no evidence aspirin or other nsaids are associated with an increased risk for the disease.[52] the drug may be effective in reduction of risk of various cancers, including those of thecolon,[ 53][54][55][56][57] [58] lung,[59][60] and possibly the upper gi tract, though some evidence of its effectiveness in preventing cancer of the upper gi tract has been inconclusive.[61][61][62]
salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported.[94]
at the cost of more stomach discomfort, nervousness and dizziness.[29] there is some evidence low-dose aspirin has benefit for reducing the occurrence of migraines in susceptible individuals.[30][31][32][33] [edit] prevention of heart attacks and strokes
in addition, the high doses of aspirin used caused liver toxicity in about 20% of the treated children,[40][41] who are the majority of rheumatic fever patients, and increased the risk of their developingreye's syndrome.[39] naproxen was shown to be as effective as aspirin and less toxic; due to the limited clinical experience, however, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.[39][42] along with rheumatic fever, kawasaki disease remains one of the few indications for aspirin use in children, although even this use has been questioned by some researchers.[43] in the united kingdom, the only indications for aspirin use in children and adolescents under 16 are kawasaki disease and prevention of blood clot formation.
this makes aspirin different from other nsaids (such asdiclofenac and ibuprofen), which are reversible inhibitors.
[ 10] [edit] pain in general, aspirin works well for dull, throbbing pain; it is ineffective for pain caused by most musclecramps, bloating, gastric distension, and acute skin irritation.[11]
its preventative effect against adenocarcinomas may be explained by its inhibition of ptgs2 (cox-2) enzymes expressed in them.[63] a 2009 article published by the journal of clinical investigation suggested that aspirin might prevent liver damage.
diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding was associated with the preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other nsaids in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding patients.[102] this box: talk edit laboratory findings in various platelet and coagulation disorders condition prothrombin time partial thromboplastin time bleeding time platelet count vitamin k deficiency or warfarin prolonged normal or mildly prolonged unaffected unaffected disseminated intravascular coagulation prolonged prolonged prolonged decreased von willebrand disease unaffected prolonged prolonged unaffected hemophilia unaffected prolonged unaffected unaffected aspirin unaffected unaffected prolonged unaffected thrombocytopenia unaffected unaffected prolonged decreased liver failure, early prolonged unaffected unaffected unaffected liver failure, end-stage prolonged prolonged prolonged decreased uremia unaffected unaffected prolonged unaffected congenital afibrinogenemia prolonged prolonged prolonged unaffected factor v deficiency prolonged prolonged unaffected unaffected factor x deficiency as seen in amyloid purpura prolonged prolonged unaffected unaffected glanzmann's thrombasthenia unaffected unaffected prolonged unaffected bernard-soulier syndrome unaffected unaffected prolonged decreased or unaffected
thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that formblood clots.
thus, in the primary prevention trials, aspirin did not change the overall mortality rate.[34] further trials are in progress[update].[34] the expert bodies diverge in their opinions regarding the use of aspirin for primary prevention, such as can be accomplished by including aspirin in a polypill for the general population.
in a 1979 research study, a dose of 350 milligrams of dgl was shown to decrease the amount of gastrointestinal bleeding induced by three adult-strength aspirin tablets (750 milligrams).[90] a dose of 500 milligrams of s-adenosyl-methionine (same, an amino acid naturally formed in the body) given together with a large dose of aspirin (1300 milligrams) in a research study reduced the amount of stomach damage by 90 percent.[91] a study found that, in contrast to oral aspirin, intravenous injection of aspirin did not produce detectable histological damage or significantly alter gastric mucosal potential difference, and concluded that high blood levels of circulating salicylate did not acutely damage gastric mucosa, so that gastric mucosal damage produced acutely after single oral doses of aspirin are due to itstopical, rather than systemic, action.[92] [edit] central effects large doses of salicylate, a metabolite of aspirin, have been proposed to causetinnitus (ringing in the ears) based on experiments in rats, via the action onarachidonic acid and nmda receptors cascade.[93] [edit] reye's syndrome main article: reye's syndrome reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver, can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illnesses or infections.
[ 10] [edit] pain in general, aspirin works well for dull, throbbing pain; it is ineffective for pain caused by most musclecramps, bloating, gastric distension, and acute skin irritation.[11]
for both males and females diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, aspirin reduces the chance of a heart attack and ischaemic stroke by about a fifth.[citation needed] this translates to an absolute rate reduction from 8.2% to 6.7% of such events per year for people already with cardiovascular disease.[citation needed] although aspirin also raises the risk ofhemorrhagic stroke and other major bleeds by about twofold, these events are rare, and the balance of aspirin's effects is positive.
after fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin treatment is unnecessary, as it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease.[39]
however, taking aspirin doubles the annual risk of major internal bleeding that normally has a very low incidence (about 1 in 1000) in middle age, but increased dramatically after 75 years old.[70] [edit] resistance for some people, aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others, an effect known as aspirin resistance or insensitivity.
the addition of caffeine in a dose of 60–130 mg to aspirin increases the analgesic effect in headache.[26][28] the combination of aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and caffeine is still more effective, but
chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%;[verification needed] chronic overdose may be especially severe in children.[103] toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, includingactivated charcoal, intravenous dextrose and normal saline, sodium bicarbonate, and dialysis.[104]

aspirin is also used in the treatment of pericarditis, coronary artery disease, and acute myocardial infarction.[44][45][46] taking aspirin before air travel in cramped conditions has been suggested to decrease the risk ofdeep-vein thrombosis (dvt).
"preadministration of high-dose salicylates, suppressors of nf-kappab activation, may increase the chemosensitivity of many cancers: an example of proapoptotic signal modulation therapy".
the most studied example is pain after surgery, such as tooth extraction, for which the highest allowed dose of aspirin (1 g) is equivalent to 1 g ofparacetamol (acetaminophen), 60 mg of codeine, or 5 mg ofoxycodone.
[ 96] aspirin causes an increased risk of cerebral microbleeds having the appearance onmri scans of 5–10 mm or smaller hypointense (dark holes) patches.[97][98] such cerebral microbleeds are important since they often occur prior toischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage, binswanger disease and alzheimer's disease.[original research?]
with large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first order to zero order, asmetabolic pathways become saturated and renal excretion becomes increasingly important.[132] salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), gentisic acid (< 1%), and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid.[133] when small doses (less than 250 mg in an adult) are ingested, all pathways proceed by first-order kinetics, with an elimination half-life of about 2.0 to 4.5 hours.
acute overdose has amortality rate of 2%.
however, taking aspirin doubles the annual risk of major internal bleeding that normally has a very low incidence (about 1 in 1000) in middle age, but increased dramatically after 75 years old.[70] [edit] resistance for some people, aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others, an effect known as aspirin resistance or insensitivity.
how products are made.
acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.[132] as much as 80% of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is metabolized in the liver.
both dogs and horses are susceptible to the gastrointestinal side-effects associated with salicylates, but it is a convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs and has shown some promise in cases oflaminitis in horses.[161][162] aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of aveterinarian; in particular,cats lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making even low doses potentially toxic.[163]
it uncouplesoxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons.[123] in short, aspirin buffers and transports the protons.
diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding was associated with the preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other nsaids in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding patients.[102] this box: laboratory findings in various platelet and coagulation disorders condition prothrombin time partial thromboplastin time bleeding time platelet count vitamin k deficiency or warfarin prolonged normal or mildly prolonged unaffected unaffected disseminated intravascular coagulation prolonged prolonged prolonged decreased von willebrand disease unaffected prolonged prolonged unaffected hemophilia unaffected prolonged unaffected unaffected aspirin unaffected unaffected prolonged unaffected thrombocytopenia unaffected unaffected prolonged decreased liver failure, early prolonged unaffected unaffected unaffected liver failure, end-stage prolonged prolonged prolonged decreased uremia unaffected unaffected prolonged unaffected congenital afibrinogenemia prolonged prolonged prolonged unaffected factor v deficiency prolonged prolonged unaffected unaffected factor x deficiency as seen in amyloid purpura prolonged prolonged unaffected unaffected glanzmann's thrombasthenia unaffected unaffected prolonged unaffected bernard-soulier syndrome unaffected unaffected prolonged decreased or unaffected [edit] overdose main article: aspirin poisoning aspirin overdose can be acute or chronic.

small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated togentisic acid.
both dogs and horses are susceptible to the gastrointestinal side-effects associated with salicylates, but it is a convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs and has shown some promise in cases oflaminitis in horses.[161][162] aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of aveterinarian; in particular,cats lack the glucuronide conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making even low doses potentially toxic.[163]
the maximum dose of aspirin (1 g) provides weaker pain relief than an intermediate dose of ibuprofen (400 mg), and this relief does not last as long.[12] a combination of aspirin and codeine may have a slightly higher analgesic effect than aspirin alone; however, this difference is not clinically meaningful.[13] it appears ibuprofen is at least equally, and possibly more, effective than this combination.[14]
thus, the protective anticoagulative effect ofpgi2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems.
the expression of tlr9 caused an inflammatory cascade involvingpro–il-1β and pro-il-18.
for example, acetazolamide andammonium chloride have been known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicyclates, andalcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs.[78][79] aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from protein binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, the immunosuppressant methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, an important part of valproate metabolism) and any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.
[ 134][135] when higher doses of salicylate are ingested (more than 4 g), the half-life becomes much longer (15–30 hours),[136] because the biotransformation pathways concerned with the formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated.[137] renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated, because it is extremely sensitive to changes inurinary ph.
[ 12] nevertheless, as a postsurgery painkiller, aspirin is inferior to ibuprofen and has higher gastrointestinal toxicity.

of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding onset of reye's syndrome, most commonly with a respiratory infection, chickenpox, or diarrhea.
one study has suggested women are more likely to be resistant than men,[71] and a different, aggregate study of 2,930 patients found 28% to be resistant.[72] a study in 100 italian patients found that, of the apparent 31% aspirin-resistant subjects, only 5% were truly resistant, and the others werenoncompliant.[73] [edit] dosage coated 325 mg aspirin tablets adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes, which vary slightly from country to country, for example 300 mg in britain and 325 mg in the usa.
for specific cancers the, reduction was about 40% forbowel cancer, 30% forlung cancer, 10% for prostate cancer and 60% for oesophageal cancer, while the reductions inpancreas, stomach, brain, breast and ovarian cancers were difficult to quantify because there were not enough data, but other studies are in progress.
in addition, aspirin induces the formation of no-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation.
effects ongrowth hormone, prolactin, [126] and tsh (with relevant effect on t3 and t4) were observed directly.[127] aspirin reduces the effects ofvasopressin[128] and increases those of naloxone[ 129] upon the secretion of acth and cortisol by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (hpa axis), which has been suggested to occur through an interaction with endogenous prostaglandins and their role in regulating the hpa axis.[128] [edit] pharmacokinetics salicylic acid is a weak acid, and very little of it is ionized in the stomach after oral administration.
"aspirin inhibits vasopressin-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity in normal humans".
the united statesfood and drug administration now recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever,[6] and the british medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency (mhra) recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on the advice of a doctor.[95] [edit] hives and swelling for a small number of people, taking aspirin can result in symptoms that resemble an allergic reaction, includinghives, swelling and headache.
a combination of aspirin and caffeine, in general, affords greater pain relief than aspirin alone.
endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express ptgs2, and, by selectively inhibiting ptgs2, prostaglandin production (to be specific, pgi2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as ptgs1 in platelets is unaffected.
[ 134][135] when higher doses of salicylate are ingested (more than 4 g), the half-life becomes much longer (15–30 hours),[136] because the biotransformation pathways concerned with the formation of salicyluric acid and salicyl phenolic glucuronide become saturated.[137] renal excretion of salicylic acid becomes increasingly important as the metabolic pathways become saturated, because it is extremely sensitive to changes inurinary ph.

however, recent research suggests the high death toll of the 1918 flu was partly due to aspirin, as the doses used at times can lead to toxicity, fluid in the lungs, and, in some cases, contribute to secondary bacterial infections and mortality.[147] aspirin's profitability led to fierce competition and the proliferation of aspirin brands and products, especially after the american patent held by bayer expired in 1917.[148][149]
corticosteroids may also reduce the concentration of aspirin.
it is of historical interest that in the u.s., a 325 mg dose is equivalent to the historic 5-grain aspirin tablet in use prior to the metric system.
for example, acetazolamide andammonium chloride have been known to enhance the intoxicating effect of salicyclates, andalcohol also increases the gastrointestinal bleeding associated with these types of drugs.[78][79] aspirin is known to displace a number of drugs from protein binding sites in the blood, including the antidiabetic drugs tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, the immunosuppressant methotrexate, phenytoin, probenecid, valproic acid (as well as interfering with beta oxidation, an important part of valproate metabolism) and any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug.
although some enteric coated formulations of aspirin are advertised as being "gentle to the stomach", in one study enteric coating did not seem to reduce this risk.[85] combining aspirin with other nsaids has also been shown to further increase this risk.[85] using aspirin in combination with clopidogrel or warfarin also increases the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.[86]
more evidence that low dose is all that is needed (from medscape)".
hence, when physicians tell patients to stop taking nsaids, they usually imply aspirin as well.
a large, randomized, controlled trial in 2000 of aspirin against placebo in 13,000 patients with hip fractures found "a 29% relative risk reduction in dvt with 160 mg of aspirin taken daily for five weeks.
ibuprofen can negate the antiplatelet effect of aspirin used for cardioprotection and stroke prevention.[107] the pharmacological activity of spironolactone may be reduced by taking aspirin, and aspirin is known to compete withpenicillin g for renal tubular secretion.[108] aspirin may also inhibit the absorption ofvitamin c.[109][110][111] [edit] chemical properties aspirin, an acetyl derivative of salicylic acid, is a white, crystalline, weakly acidic substance, with amelting point of 135 °c (275 °f).
they were first to assign to it the correct structure with the acetyl group connected to the phenolic oxygen.[142] in 1897, chemists working at bayer ag produced a synthetically altered version ofsalicin, derived from the species meadowsweet (filipendula ulmaria), which caused less digestive upset than puresalicylic acid.
in the primary prevention trials, aspirin decreased the overall incidence of heart attacks and ischaemic strokes by about a tenth.
one gram of aspirin, on average, reduced the oral body temperature from39.0 °c (102.2 °f) to 37.6 °c (99.7 °f) after three hours.

owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people withpeptic ulcers, mild diabetes , orgastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin.[78][82] even if none of these conditions is present, there is still an increased risk ofstomach bleeding when aspirin is taken withalcohol or warfarin.[78][79] patients with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates.[78]
aspirin also helped with "achiness", discomfort, and headache,[37] and with sore throat pain, for those who had it.[38]
"aspirin use and reduced risk of fatal colon cancer".
owing to the issue of solubility, however, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, andplasma concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.[130][131][132] about 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is bound by protein, while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent.
in several studies, its use did not reduce the incidence of prostate cancer.[49][50] its effects on the incidence of pancreatic cancer are mixed; one study published in 2004 found a statistically significant increase in the risk of pancreatic cancer among women,[51] while a meta-analysis of several studies, published in 2006, found no evidence aspirin or other nsaids are associated with an increased risk for the disease.[52] the drug may be effective in reduction of risk of various cancers, including those of thecolon,[ 53][54][55][56][57] [58] lung,[59][60] and possibly the upper gi tract, though some evidence of its effectiveness in preventing cancer of the upper gi tract has been inconclusive.[61][61][62]
according to research done at a german university, taking equal doses of vitamin c and aspirin decreases the amount of stomach damage that occurs compared to taking aspirin alone.[88][89] it is reported that deglycyrrhizinated licorice (dgl), an extract of the popular herb licorice, helps relieve the symptoms of gastritis.
patients with mild carotid artery stenosis benefit from aspirin; it is recommended after a carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery stent.
there is a 10- to 20-fold increase in renal clearance when urine ph is increased from 5 to 8.
in comparison, there was an estimated absolute risk reduction in myocardial infarction of 137 events per 10.000 persons, and a reduction of 39 events per 10.000 persons in ischemic stroke.[99] in cases where ich already has occurred, aspirin use results in higher mortality, with a dose of approximately 250 mg per day resulting in a relative risk of death within three months after the ich of approximately 2.5 (95%confidence interval 1.3 to 4.6).[100] aspirin and other nsaids can cause hyperkalemia by inducing a hyporenin hypoaldosteronic state via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically causehyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state.[101] aspirin can cause prolonged bleeding after operations for up to 10 days.
aspirin irreversibly inhibits cox-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of cox-2.

acetylsalicylic acid is stable in dry air, but graduallyhydrolyses in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylicacids.
in solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.[112] [edit] synthesis the synthesis of aspirin is classified as an esterification reaction.
this antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks.[121] 40 mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane a2 release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin i2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.[122] prostaglandins are local hormones produced in the body and have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of thehypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation.
the addition of caffeine in a dose of 60–130 mg to aspirin increases the analgesic effect in headache.[26][28] the combination of aspirin, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and caffeine is still more effective, but
salicylate is also produced as a result of exposure tobismuth subsalicylate, methyl salicylate and sodium salicylate.[105][106] [edit] interactions aspirin is known to interact with other drugs.
the most studied example is pain after surgery, such as tooth extraction, for which the highest allowed dose of aspirin (1 g) is equivalent to 1 g ofparacetamol (acetaminophen), 60 mg of codeine, or 5 mg ofoxycodone.
this reduced leukocyte adhesion, which is an important step in immune response to infection; however, there is currently insufficient evidence to show that aspirin helps to fight infection.[124] more recent data also suggests that salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling throughnf-κb.[125] nf-κb, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.
these metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity.
