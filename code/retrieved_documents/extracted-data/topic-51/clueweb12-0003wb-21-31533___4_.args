many fevers are caused by viral infections, and the combination of aspirin and viral illness has been linked to the development of reye's syndrome, a progressive and very dangerous liver disease.paracetamol is also an analgesic (pain reliever), so it eases the discomfort and body aches that often accompany fever.since viruses and bacteria do not survive as well in a body with an elevated temperature, fever is actually an ally in fighting infection.as a result, signs other than a fever - poor appetite, lethargy and irritability - may be earlier indicators of an infection and are more helpful than temperature in assessing a newborn's condition.an elevated temperature also increases the production of infection-fighting white blood cells and even increases their speed of response and enhances their killing capacity.when the sufferer has fever and shows signs of febrile seizures: muscles throughout the entire body stiffen, eyes may roll, your child's head may jerk, hands and/or feet may tap, and loss of bowel and urine control may occur.in a newborn, the body's temperature control is not yet well developed.a child with a mild cold may have a temperature of 40°c, while a child with a serious illness - bacterial pneumonia, for example - may have a temperature lower than that.dehydration, overexertion, mosquito bites, bee stings, allergic or toxic reactions and viral or bacterial infections are just a few.you are said to be suffering from a fever if your body temperature is over 37°c (37.8°c or more when measured rectally).in an adult, the level of fever generally reflects the severity of the illness causing it.treatment paracetamol (found in panado, calpol and other over-the-counter medications) is a drug that helps to lower fever.treatment paracetamol (found in  panado, calpol and other over-the-counter medications) is a drug that helps to lower fever.home treatment administer paracetamol to reduce a fever of 40°c or higher.rather, a fever is a sign that the body is defending itself against the infectious invader.
