they were first to assign to it the correct structure with the acetyl group connected to the phenolic oxygen.[6] in 1897 felix hoffmann a chemist at friedrich bayer & co. obtained acetylsalicylic acid[7] by a reaction of salicylic acid and acetic anhydride,[8] that is essentially repeating the gilm/kraut procedure but substituting acetic anhydride for acetyl chloride.
thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation ofplatelets that formblood clots.
while their extract was somewhat effective, it also caused digestive problems such as gastric irritation and bleeding and diarrhea, and even death when consumed in high doses.
prostaglandins are local hormones (paracrine) produced in the body and have diverse effects in the body, including but not limited to transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of thehypothalamic thermostat, and inflammation.
the syndrome is due to fatty degeneration of liver cells.

gall bladder - there is some evidence that aspirin may increase gall bladder motility and thus be effective in treating gall bladder disease.
prostate - while there is some epidemiological information suggesting a correlation between the reduction of prostate cancer and aspirin use, two recent studies (a multicentric case-control study and epidemiological study) were inconclusive.[31][32] colon - a 2005 jama article states that aspirin may prevent carcinoma of the colon, when taken in at least twice-daily adult (325 mg) doses.
the results of these studies have been correlated with experimental studies in human volunteers and in rodents.
patients are monitored and often treated according to their individual symptoms, patients may be givenintravenous potassium chloride to counteracthypokalemia, glucose to restore blood sugar levels, benzodiazepines for any seizure activity, fluids fordehydration, and importantly sodium bicarbonate to restore the blood's sensitive ph balance.
similar struggle took place in the circuit court in chicago; however, in the us the bayer's patent was upheld in 1909.[7] this created a situation when aspirin in the us was three times more expensive than in canada and ten times more expensive than in europe, and resulted in rampant smuggling of aspirin, which bayer unsuccessfully tried to contain.[7] bayer began marketing aspirin in july 1899.[7]
as described above, it was then later found that acetic anhydride was a better acylating agent, with the byproduct acetic acid formed, which does not have the unwanted properties of hydrochloric acid and can also be recycled.

chronic overdose is more commonly lethal with a mortality rate of 25%; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children.[22] symptoms edit aspirin overdose has potentially serious consequences, sometimes leading to significant morbidity and mortality.
however, these doses can have a higher incidence of serious gastrointestinal bleeding, and reduced doses (even the low doses recommended for cardiovascular health (81 mg/day)) also seem to have an anti-cancer effect, albeit not as much as the higher doses.
unfortunately, the byproduct from this is hydrochloric acid , which is corrosive and environmentally hazardous.
children, including teenagers, are discouraged from using aspirin in cold or flu symptoms as this has been linked withreye's syndrome.[1] patients with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take salicylates.

furthermore, aspirin has 2 additional modes of actions, contributing to its strong analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties: it uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons.

this may be because many lung tumors have high amounts of cox-2 enzymes expressed in them, especially in adenocarcinomas and tumors caused by asbestosis.[39] aspirin is a known blocker of both cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes, although this study suggests that if the cox-2 link is direct, other cox-2 inhibitors may also play a similar role.
