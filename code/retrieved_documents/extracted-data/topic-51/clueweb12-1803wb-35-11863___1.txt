nac is  theorized to work by a number of protective mechanisms.
patients with malnutrition, aids, chronic ethanol abuse, or anorexia  nervosa may be at increased risk for morbidity because of deficient glutathione  stores and inadequate detoxification of napqi.
drug category: gi decontaminants -- emergency treatment in poisoning caused by drugs and chemicals.
frequency: in the us: acetaminophen is one of the most common agents  in overdose reported to the american association of poison control centers.
nac also functions as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant  and has positive inotropic and vasodilating effects, which improve  microcirculatory blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues.
because antidotal therapy is most efficacious when initiated within 8  hours postingestion, the clinician must attempt to obtain an accurate history  of the time(s) of ingestion, the quantity and formulation of acetaminophen  ingested, and any co-ingestants (eg, diphenhydramine, other anticholinergic  drugs, opioids), which may delay absorption.
both ibuprofen and aspirin cause gastrointestinal bleeding because they are chemical that are irritating and the dosages is high (325 mg or more for aspirin, 400 & 800 mg for ibuprofen).
2) it costs a fraction of ibuprofen. 3)  those women taking aspirin regularly while pregnant have under  one-forth the incident of caesarean section (5.6% versus 23.9% in a meta-study).

second, they both cause stomach bleeding.
nac also functions as an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant and has positive inotropic and vasodilating effects, which improve microcirculatory blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues.
napqi has an extremely short half-life and is rapidly conjugated with glutathione, a sulfhydryl donor, and removed from the system.
for these reasons, antiemetic therapy often is necessary to allow successful administration of nac.
nac increases glutathione  stores, combines directly with napqi as a glutathione substitute, and enhances  sulfate conjugation.

vasodilating  effects decrease morbidity and mortality once hepatotoxicity is well  established.
patients with enhanced ability  to make napqi because of induction of the p450 system, specifically cyp2e1, may  be at increased risk of morbidity; these patients include those taking agents  known to induce this enzyme activity, such as rifampin, phenobarbital,  isoniazid, phenytoin, carbamazepine, or patients with chronic ethanol abuse.
