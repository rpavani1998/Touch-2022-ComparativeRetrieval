beyond its role as a pain reliever, aspirin is showing value in preventing ischemic (clotting) strokes and in slowing the formation of cataracts.it works like aspirin to block both fever and swelling and may work better against certain types of pain, like menstrual cramps.aspirin interferes with many types of medication, including drugs taken for gout, diabetes, and kidney disease.its ability to relieve pain is unequaled even by many highly-touted prescription drugs.in addition, regular aspirin use may increase risks of bleeding stroke, which is more often fatal than ischemic stroke.regular aspirin use also damages the kidneys and can trigger sudden renal failure.aspirin can trigger a serious, often fatal sickness called reye's syndrome in young people recovering from chicken pox or the flu.but no matter what form you buy or where you find it, all aspirin works in the same way: by blocking production of hormone-like chemicals (called prostaglandins) involved in everything from blood circulation and clotting to body temperature, digestion, and breathing.because aspirin can disrupt normal blood clotting and cause bleeding, it should be avoided at least one week prior to surgery and during pregnancy.for more severe pain, a physician can prescribe other preparations, including narcotics and synthetic pain relievers.in fact, evidence of the drug's dangers in pregnancy -- including prolonged labor, heavier bleeding, and abnormal clotting in mother and child -- has prompted federal officials to recommend warning labels for all aspirin products.should none of these over-the-counter drugs satisfactorily reduce discomfort, pain may be a sign of a more serious problem warranting a doctor's attention.and although it's safe and cheap and effective, it can be dangerous -- even deadly -- when used incorrectly or in larger-than-recommended doses.the most common effect of overuse is stomach upset -- from pain and nausea to bleeding ulcers and chronic indigestion.its effects are also altered by vitamin c, which slows elimination of the drug from the body, and by alcohol.
