although infections are the most common causes of higher than normal body temperature, fevers have a long list of other causes, including toxins, cancers, and autoimmune diseases.in addition, a fever activates the body's immune system to make more white blood cells, antibodies, and other infection-fighting agents.like aspirin, it helps fight inflammation at the source of the fever.if a child is playful and comfortable, drinking plenty of fluids, and able to sleep, fever treatment is not likely to help.aspirin is very effective for treating fever in adults.here are some guidelines for taking medicine: acetaminophen and ibuprofen help reduce fever in children and adults.untreated fevers caused by infection will seldom go over 105°f unless the child is overdressed or trapped in a hot place.heatstroke is a particularly dangerous type of high temperature, because the body is not able to stop the temperature from continuing to rise.if heat illness is causing the fever, medicines may not lower the body temperature and may even be harmful.once a child is already known to have a high fever, a febrile seizure is unlikely with the current illness.anyone has a fever over 105°f (40.5°c), unless it comes down readily with treatment and the person is comfortable.far from being an enemy, it is an important part of the body's defense against infection.it can be raised by physical activity, strong emotion, eating, heavy clothing, medications, high room temperature, and high humidity.a baby 3 to 12 months old has a fever of 102.2°f (39°c) or higher.if the fever is mild and no other problems are present, no medical treatment is required.
