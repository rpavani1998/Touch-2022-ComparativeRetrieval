when a child’s temperature reaches 105°, this is considered a medical emergency and the child needs immediate medical attention, according to the american academy of pediatrics.therefore, pediatricians and other healthcare providers recommend that aspirin (or any medication that contains aspirin) not be used to treat any viral illnesses in children.it also stimulates an inflammatory response, which sends all kinds of substances to the area of infection to protect the area, prevent the spread of the invader, and start the healing process.children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years can develop seizures from a high fever (called febrile seizures).treating your child's fever will not help the body get rid of the infection any quicker, it simply will relieve discomfort associated with fever.a fever actually helps the body destroy its microbial invader.when this membrane is disrupted or broken, the contents that escape can be toxic to the body and stimulate the brain to raise the temperature.children older than two months of age with a fever of 102° or higher that does not respond to fever-reducing medication should be seen by a physician.according to the american academy of pediatrics, if your child is younger than two months of age and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 degrees fahrenheit or higher, you should call your pediatrician.children with fevers may become more uncomfortable as the temperature rises.if your child is very uncomfortable with a lower fever, treatment may be necessary.if your child does have a febrile seizure, there is a chance that the seizure may occur again, but, usually, children outgrow the febrile seizures.the organs involved in helping with temperature regulation include the brain, skin, muscle, and blood vessels.specific treatment for a fever will be determined by your physician based on: aspirin and the risk of reye syndrome in children do not give aspirin to a child without first contacting the child's physician.the symptoms of a fever may resemble other medical conditions.
