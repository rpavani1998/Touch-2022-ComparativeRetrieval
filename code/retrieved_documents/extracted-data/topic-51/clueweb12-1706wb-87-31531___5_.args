trust your instincts and call the child's physician for guidance anytime you are uncomfortable with your child's condition, and remember that the child's physician should be contacted for any fever that spikes rapidly or persists despite treatment.a tepid bath (water that is neither too cool or too warm to the touch) may reduce the fever, as well as comfort the child.to safely reduce fever in children, use acetaminophen or ibuprofen products.signs that indicate that fever in very young children include: symptoms, specific indications an older child may be able to describe, include: when your child appears to have a fever, it is best to take his/her temperature with: taking a temperature reading with a thermometer directly touching certain areas of the skin, such as under the armpit or in the bend of the elbow, is not recommended because it is not considered to be reliable.therefore, pediatricians and other healthcare providers recommend that aspirin not be used to treat any fever in children.because a baby or young child may not be able to express how he or she is feeling, parents may look for signs -- outward indications -- that fever is present before using a thermometer.fevers may be treated in a manner previously discussed with your child's physician during well-care checkups.once you have determined that your child does have fever, you may treat it in a manner that you have previously discussed with the child's physician.although high fevers may bring on convulsions or delirium, generally it is not how high the fever is, but how rapidly the temperature rose that causes a convulsion.fever (also called pyrexia) is defined as body temperature that is higher than normal for each individual.it may be a bacterial or viral infection, or simply a reaction from an allergy, or becoming overheated at play or in the sun.your child's physician may have different definitions of fever than these, and will provide guidelines for when to treat fever yourself and when to call the physician's office.for example, influenza may cause a fever of 104, while pneumonia may cause a very low-grade fever or no fever at all.how high the fever is may not be a good indication of how mild or severe the disorder is.but, call the doctor anytime you are not comfortable with your child's condition, and certainly for any fever that spikes rapidly or persists despite treatment.
