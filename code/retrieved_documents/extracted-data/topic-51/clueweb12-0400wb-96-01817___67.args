chickenpox is acquired by direct contact with infected blister fluid or by inhalation of respiratory droplets.
therefore, it may take about a week until new lesions stop appearing and existing lesions crust over.
with hsv-2 (genital herpes), transmission of the virus can occur when the infected sexual partner does not have an active outbreak.
while active, the virus begins to multiply (called shedding), and becomes transmittable again.
in women, the lesions may be visible outside the vagina, but they commonly occur inside the vagina.
investigative agents: cannabinoids are compounds in marijuana (cannabis)

children with no immune problems and those who had chickenpox before they were one year-old are at higher risk for shingles.
if a pregnant woman has had chickenpox before the pregnancy, the baby will be protected from infection for the first few months of life, since the mother's immunity gets passed on to the baby through the placenta and breast milk.
administered intravenously (into the veins), the drug can have toxic effects, such as kidney damage (which is reversible) and seizures.
although typically caused by the epstein-barr virus (ebv), mononucleosis can also be caused by other herpes viruses including cytomegalovirus (cmv).
if an individual is not immune to chickenpox, traveling abroad can increase the risk of contracting the condition.
however, many individuals with hsv-2 infection may never have sores, or they may have very mild sores that they do not even notice or that they mistake for insect bites or another skin condition.
herpes simplex virus type 2 (hsv-2, genital herpes): measures for preventing genital herpes are the same as those for preventing other sexually transmitted diseases (stds).
the intensity of the pain can vary, but pain-free intervals are rare.
although hsv-2 is widely recognized as a cause of genital herpes, it can cause oral herpes as well.

anyone who has had chickenpox is at risk for developing shingles at some point in their lives.
following the active infection, the virus becomes latent (dormant), residing in the nerve cells and may reactivate later causing a new outbreak at or near the original site.
herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv-1, herpes labialis, oral herpes): taking steps to guard against the development of cold sores, to prevent spreading them to other parts of the body, or to avoid passing them along to another person is important when dealing with oral herpes.
this reactivation usually occurs without symptoms of illness, although it may be linked to symptoms of cfs.
the pimples will progress to red teardrop blisters about five to ten millimeters (1/4-1/2 inch) wide.
