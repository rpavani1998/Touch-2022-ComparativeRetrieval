aspirin (oracetylsalicylic acid) works in part by suppressing the production of prostaglandins, hormone-like substances that have wide-ranging roles throughout the body, such as stimulating uterine contractions, regulating body temperature and blood vessel constriction, and helping blood clotting.however, even at moderate doses, acetaminophen can cause liver damage in heavy drinkers.the label also alerts pregnant women that use of aspirin in the last trimester may increase the risk of stillbirth and of maternal and fetal bleeding during delivery.aspirin also causes gastrointestinal (gi) upset indirectly (by inhibiting production of a prostaglandin that protects the stomach lining by stimulating mucus production); buffering does nothing to offset this effect.though acetaminophen is no better or faster at relief than aspirin, the drug is gentler on the stomach and reduces fever without the risk of reyes syndrome.though acetaminophen is no better or faster at relief than aspirin, the drug is gentler on the stomach and reduces fever without the risk of reyes syndrome.however, they are more potent relievers, especially for menstrual cramps, toothaches, minor arthritis, and injuries accompanied by inflammation, such as tendinitis.although ibuprofen and naproxen sodium interfere with blood clotting much less than aspirin does, they should not be used by people who have bleeding disorders or who are taking anticoagulants.fda requires products containing aspirin and other salicylates to carry a label warning that children and teenagers should not use the medicine for chickenpox or flu symptoms because of its association with reyes syndrome, a rare disorder that may cause seizures, brain damage, and death.acetaminophen is as effective as aspirin in relieving mild-to-moderate pain and in reducing fever, but less so when it comes to soft tissue injuries, such as muscle strains and sprains, he adds.acetaminophen is as effective as aspirin in relieving mild-to-moderate pain and in reducing fever, but less so when it comes to soft tissue injuries, such as muscle strains and sprains, he adds.continual high dosages of aspirin can cause hearing loss or tinnitis--a persistent ringing in the ears.last september, an fda advisory panel recommended that labels on products containing aspirin warn that heavy drinkers are especially vulnerable to developing gi bleeding.they may be useful for people who get heartburn or stomach pain when they take aspirin, as well as for those with arthritis, who need to take as much as 4,000 mg every day.they may be useful for people who get heartburn or stomach  pain when they take aspirin, as well as for those with arthritis, who need to take as much as 4,000 mg every day.
