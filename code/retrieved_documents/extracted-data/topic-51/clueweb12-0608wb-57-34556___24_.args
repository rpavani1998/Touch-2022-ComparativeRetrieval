people at higher risk for flu complications, including students, faculty and staff with certain chronic medical conditions (such as asthma, heart disease or diabetes), who become sick with flu-like illness should call their health care provider as soon as possible to determine if they need antiviral treatment.pregnant women are at higher risk of complications from flu and, like all people at higher risk, should speak with their health care provider as soon as possible if they develop flu-like symptoms.antiviral medications are appropriate for some, but not all, persons with flu-like symptoms.antiviral medicines are not given to all people during flu season because most people get better on their own, over-use can promote antiviral-resistant viruses and administration of antiviral medicines can cause adverse reactions in some people.these medicines can be given to people who are sick with flu to help bring their fever down and relieve their pain.early treatment with antiviral medicines often can prevent hospitalizations and deaths.early treatment with antiviral flu medicines is recommended for pregnant women who have the flu; these medicines are most effective when started within the first 48 hours of feeling sick.severe symptoms include increased fever, shortness of breath, chest pain or pressure, fast breathing, bluish skin color, vomiting, dizziness or confusion.as stated in the regulation and in an effort to ease the burden on health care providers, if an employee is ill for more than three days with the flu, supervisors and/or managers are permitted to allow the employee to provide a written statement of the facts concerning the illness without requiring a doctor's note.there will be on-going communication to instruct students, faculty and staff to promptly seek medical attention if they have a medical condition that places them at higher risk of flu-related complications, are concerned about their illness or develop severe symptoms.keeping people with a fever at home may reduce the number of people who get infected with the flu virus.antiviral medications, if started within the first 48 hours of onset of symptoms, may reduce the length of illness.pregnant women are at higher risk of complications from fluduring current flu conditions, people who are sick should stay home and away from other people until at least 24 hoursafter they no longer have a fever or signs of a fever.aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) should not be given to anyone younger than 18 years of age who has flu; this can cause a rare but serious illness called reye's syndrome.
