taking a corticosteroid drug through an inhaler makes it possible to provide effective local anti-inflammatory activity in the lungs with very few side effects elsewhere in the body.adverse effects of prolonged use of oral steroids include cataracts, glaucoma, osteoporosis, diabetes, fluid retention, susceptibility to infections, weight gain, hypertension, capillary fragility, acne, excess hair growth, wasting of the muscles, menstrual irregularities, irritability, insomnia, and psychosis.the overuse of bronchodilators can have serious consequences; not using steroids can lead to permanent lung damage.people who self-manage their asthma with peak air flow measurements and adjust their medications as needed have fewer hospitalizations and unplanned doctors' visits, and, generally, have a better quality of life than those who rely only on the occasional doctor or emergency room visit to control symptoms.they can be dangerous when used alone, because they can mask asthma symptoms, and they can increase the risk of asthma death unless paired with an inhaled steroid.in about 5% of cases, aspirin is responsible for a syndrome that involves multiple attacks of asthma, sinusitis, and nasal congestion.just like a drug, herbs and supplements can affect the body's chemistry, and therefore have the potential to produce side effects that may be harmful.inhaled steroids are generally considered safe and effective and only rarely cause any of the more serious side effects reported with prolonged use of oral steroids.the use of inhaled corticosteroids in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma reduces the risk of rehospitalization and death from asthma.breathing exercises may help improve patientsâ€™ quality of life even if they do not have a major impact on medication reduction.asthma action plans create a written document for patients to manage asthma during stable times and to more easily identify when asthma is worsening.immunotherapy poses some risk for severe allergic reactions, however, especially for children with poorly controlled asthma.overdose can be serious and in rare cases even life threatening, particularly in patients with heart disease.leukotrienes are powerful immune system factors that, in excess, produce a battery of damaging chemicals that can cause inflammation and spasms in the airways of people with asthma.in about 10% of severe persistent cases, changes in the structure of the walls of the airways lead to progressive and irreversible problems in lung function, even in aggressively treated patients.
