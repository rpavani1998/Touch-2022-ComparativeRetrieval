the downside of coated aspirin products is that they may take up to twice as long to provide relief as plain aspirin, according to weintraub.
"while these ingredients are safe, they have not been proven effective against uterine cramps, although they may relieve other symptoms associated with menstrual pain." says weintraub.
the lowest dosage strength for prescription-strength ibuprofen (motrin and others) is 300 mg per tablet, and 275 mg per tablet for the prescription version of naproxen sodium (anaprox, for example).
"there is no evidence that caffeine relieves pain , but it can enhance the effects of aspirin, possibly by lifting a person's mood," says michael weintraub, m.d., director of fda's office of otc drug evaluation.

aspirin also causes gastrointestinal (gi) upset indirectly (by inhibiting production of a prostaglandin that protects the stomach lining by stimulating mucus production); buffering does nothing to offset this effect.

buffered formulas may offset aspirin'sdirectly irritating effects on the stomach lining.
aspirin should not be taken by people who have: - ulcers, because it can worsen symptoms - asthma, because it can trigger an attack in some asthmatics - uncontrolled high blood pressure, because of an increased risk of one type of stroke - liver or kidney disease, because it may worsen these conditions - bleeding disorders or who are taking anticoagulant medication, because it may cause bleeding.
"regular" strength aspirin contains 325 milligrams (mg) per tablet; "extra" or "maximum" strength, 500 mg per tablet.
acetaminophen-based products to ease menstrual cramps often contain other ingredients, such as pamabrom (a diuretic) orpyrilamine maleate (an antihistamine used for its sedative effects).
the label also alerts pregnant women that use of aspirin in the last trimester may increase the risk of stillbirth and of maternal and fetal bleeding during delivery.
they may be useful for people who get heartburn or stomach pain when they take aspirin, as well as for those with arthritis, who need to take as much as 4,000 mg every day.
however, even at moderate doses, acetaminophen can cause liver damage in heavy drinkers.
aspirin (oracetylsalicylic acid) works in part by suppressing the production of prostaglandins, hormone-like substances that have wide-ranging roles throughout the body, such as stimulating uterine contractions, regulating body temperature and blood vessel constriction, and helping blood clotting.
in addition, asthmatics and people who are allergic to aspirin should avoid ibuprofen and naproxen sodium.
"in addition, the pharmaceutical companies had to show that these drugs were safe for use by a larger, more varied group of people [than would have received them by prescription only] and that the drugs were safe to use without medical supervision, as is the case with all nonprescription drugs."
although ibuprofen and naproxen sodium interfere with blood clotting much less than aspirin does, they should not be used by people who have bleeding disorders or who are taking anticoagulants.
the warning labels on these products include limitations on duration of use to ensure that chronic or serious illnesses are not masked.
since a two-tablet dose provides roughly the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee, you can get the same effect by taking two plain aspirin with coffee.
buffered formulas may offset aspirin'sdirectly irritating effects on the stomach lining.

an fda advisory panel has recommended labeling on ibuprofen products like that recommended for aspirin, warning heavy drinkers about increased risk of gastric bleeding and impaired liver function (products with naproxen sodium labels already include this information).
acetaminophen-based products to ease menstrual cramps often contain other ingredients, such as pamabrom (a diuretic) orpyrilamine maleate (an antihistamine used for its sedative effects).
though acetaminophen is no better or faster at relief than aspirin, the drug is gentler on the stomach and reduces fever without the risk of reyes syndrome.
from prescription to over-the-counter like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen sodium inhibit prostaglandin production.
"ibuprofen and naproxen sodium were converted to otc status after their manufacturers did the necessary studies to show that these relievers were effective at otc dosages, which are lower than prescription dosages," explains weintraub.
choosing an otc reliever involves balancing effectiveness for a particular ailment with side effects.
taken at the recommended adult dosage, otc ibuprofen (advil and others) and naproxen sodium (aleve) are somewhat gentler on the stomach than aspirin.
aspirin (oracetylsalicylic acid) works in part by suppressing the production of prostaglandins, hormone-like substances that have wide-ranging roles throughout the body, such as stimulating uterine contractions, regulating body temperature and blood vessel constriction, and helping blood clotting.
fda requires products containing aspirin and other salicylates to carry a label warning that children and teenagers should not use the medicine for chickenpox or flu symptoms because of its association with reyes syndrome, a rare disorder that may cause seizures, brain damage, and death.

continual high dosages of aspirin can cause hearing loss or tinnitis--a persistent ringing in the ears.

although ibuprofen and naproxen sodium interfere with blood clotting much less than aspirin does, they should not be used by people who have bleeding disorders or who are taking anticoagulants.
though this cornucopia can seem confusing, the products' relieving ingredients fall into just four categories: aspirin (and other salicylates), acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium.
