if your child has a pre-existing medical condition or is already taking other medicines, talk to your child's doctor to make sure that acetaminophen or ibuprofen is safe for your child.some minor viral illnesses may have high fevers associated with them, and some serious bacterial infections may be associated with an abnormally low body temperature.fevers themselves may help to fight infections because many germs do not survive as well at slightly higher body temperatures.these medicines are used to help manage the fever and to make your child more comfortable, but they do not treat the underlying cause of the fever.rarely, heat stroke or exposure to certain medicines or drugs can cause a severe and possibly dangerous increase in body temperature.in this sense, although the child may be uncomfortable, most fevers have a beneficial effect and may help the body fight infection.some non-infectious illnesses and some other chronic diseases can cause recurrent or persistent fevers.most body heat is lost through the skin, so overdressing or bundling your child may result in a higher fever and can make your child more uncomfortable.approximately 5% of children between the ages of 6 months and 6 years may have a shaking episode called a seizure or convulsion associated with a fever.fever may also be caused by other conditions: a mild increase in body temperature can occur with exercise or too much clothing, after a hot bath or shower, or in hot weather.usually, these symptoms are mild and the child may be slightly cranky or have aches and pains.most infections are caused by viruses, so an antibiotic will have no effect on them.medicines may only reduce the fever by 1째c to 2째c (2째f to 3째f), and may not bring the temperature down to normal.your doctor or pharmacist can help you decide on the most appropriate formulation and strength for your child.the available published evidence suggests that teething does not cause fever or may be slightly associated only with a very mild fever.
