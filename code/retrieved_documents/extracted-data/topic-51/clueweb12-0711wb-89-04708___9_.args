oral decongestants stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and can increase blood pressure and pulse - risky for those with hypertension.they can have a sedating effect and are often added to multisymptom cold remedies because of their ability to counteract the stimulant effect of decongestants.people who have heart complaints, asthma, chronic kidney disease or diabetes, or who are taking medications (for instance, steroids) are more susceptible to colds and flu.antihistamines may reduce a runny nose and sneezing, but have a minimal effect on other symptoms.traditional approaches - usually involving rest, liquids and keeping warm - may not be glamorous but, in the end, appear to be effective, less prone to adverse effects and less expensive.prescription drugs, like antibiotics, can also increase colds/ flu susceptibility.the key to these and other remedies may be to treat at the first signs of cold or flu.they can cause heart rhythm disturbances, anxiety and a rebound effect.overuse of antibiotics also contributes to the emergence of ‘superbugs’, and can deplete the friendly gut bacteria needed to maintain good health and immunity.stressed children have a greater susceptibility to urti and show measurable decreases in mucosal immunity (j psychosom res, 1997; 43: 271-8).australian doctors report that flucloxacillin, a semisynthetic penicillin, can cause cholestatic jaundice (med j aust, 1989; 151: 701-5), though its relation to the drug may go unrecognised because of a delayed onset (lancet, 1992; 339: 679).reviews of the benefits of vaccines in healthy adults have shown that these are negligible, sucessfully reducing the number of virus carriers (as shown by blood tests), but not of those who actually develop the flu (cochrane database syst rev, 2000; [2]: cd001269; vaccine, 2000; 18: 957-1030).in one study, this chemical increased the risk of stroke in women more than threefold (n engl j med, 2000; 343: 1826-32).older patients and those receiving flucloxacillin for more than two weeks are particularly at risk (bmj, 1993; 306: 233-5).as flu can be caused by any of hundreds of strains of myxovirus, which mutate more or less constantly, vaccination amounts to a kind of biological russian roulette.
