although type 2 rheumatoid arthritis is progressive and there is no cure, over time the disease becomes less aggressive, and symptoms may even improve.although there is no definitive evidence to support their efficacy, some alternative procedures -- such as acupuncture, massage, mineral baths (balneotherapy), relaxation techniques, biofeedback, and hypnosis -- are not harmful and may be a useful adjunct to standard treatments.long-term, regular use of nsaids (with the exception of aspirin) can increase the risk for heart attack, especially for people who have a heart condition.the most serious and common side effects of cyclosporine are high blood pressure and kidney function problems.just like a drug, herbs and supplements can affect the body's chemistry, and therefore have the potential to produce side effects that may be harmful.azathioprine can also cause problems with liver function and pancreas gland inflammation, and can reduce white blood cell count.other adverse effects include cataracts, glaucoma, diabetes, fluid retention, susceptibility to infections, weight gain, hypertension, capillary fragility, acne, excess hair growth, wasting of the muscles, menstrual irregularities, irritability, insomnia, and, rarely, psychosis.rheumatoid arthritis is most likely triggered by a combination of factors, including an abnormal autoimmune response, genetic susceptibility, and some environmental or biologic trigger, such as a viral infection or hormonal changes.small, short-term studies have shown that this therapy may slow or even halt the progression of the disease in a third to a half of patients.recent research suggests that prednisone can increase the risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer.this drug class was initially thought to provide benefits equal to nsaids but cause less gastrointestinal distress.investigators are reporting that transplantation of donated hemopoietic stem cells, which mature into various blood cells, has induced remission in a few children with severe juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.these drugs block prostaglandins, the substances that dilate blood vessels and cause inflammation and pain.there have been a few cases of severe adrenal insufficiency that occurred when switching from oral to inhaled steroids, which, in rare cases, has resulted in death.as with other rheumatoid arthritis drugs, these drugs do not cure the disease but can help slow progression and joint damage.
