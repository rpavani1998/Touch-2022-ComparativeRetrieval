one major threat posed by fevers is permanent brain damage caused by a very high fever.fevers are normally caused by infection, but occasionally in newborns, especially premature infants, an infection may not be the cause of a fever.aspirin and other salicylates also reduce fever but should never be taken by someone under the age of 18.tylenol and nsaids are fever reducers.and occasionally relieving a child's fever may give the child a chance to sleep, relax, or calm down.the best fever reducer is without a doubt ibuprofen, which is an nsaid, which stands for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.acetaminophen, or paracetamol, (brand name: tylenol) reduces fever for some people but not all, like myself.many children are capable of tolerating a fever.our immune system functions much more efficiently at a warmer temperature.in fact, you want to support it by drinking water and taking vitamins and supplements to give your body energy and materials to fight the infection.fevers are serious business, so if you have any concerns about your child's well-being, call your doctor.ginger is said to have anti-inflammatory effects.an oral temperature of 99.5ยบ f or a rectal temperature of 100.4ยบ f is considered a fever in children.if the child becomes listless, has a severe headache, has persistent vomiting, or has a fever that isn't responding to fever-reducing medication, see a doctor.but it really should only be done when absolutely needed because suppressing our immune systems will only keep ourselves sick longer.
