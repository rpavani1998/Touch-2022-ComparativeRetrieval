if mulch is not carefully cleaned it may contain pieces of wire that are dangerous to children.thus, when selecting surfacing, take the time necessary to do the research required for selecting the type of service that is going to provide you with the best equation for safety and value over the long term.artificial turf playground surfacing advantages · means of containment are sometimes not necessary · surfaces are wheelchair accessible and easy to walk on · displacement of materials is not an issue, so the protective ability of these surfaces remains consistent even in high-traffic areas ·although both tile and pip are generally made with the same types of raw materials, the cost savings are realized in production efficiencies, lower installation cost as well as longevity of the pre-manufactured product.artificial turf playground surfacing ·        means of containment are sometimes not necessary ·        surfaces are wheelchair accessible and easy to walk on ·

maintenance over time and are easy to clean.recreational facilities, including play areas, are among the facilities required to comply with the ada.manufactured products may be more susceptible to bacteria or fungus.·        rubber mulch tends to be cleaner and less likely than other loose fill materials to produce dirty clothing, hands and shoes during active play.· rubber mulch tends to be cleaner and less likely than other loose fill materials to produce dirty clothing, hands and shoes during active play.#8 it is important to note that the cpsc has also identified that 79 percent of all playground related injuries come from falls, and of that, 68 percent of those injuries come from falls to the playground surface.·        animals and insects are not attracted to rubber mulch
