it contributes to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions to, and securing the rights of, marginalised producers and workers, especially in the south.the primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people.organic agriculture practices cannot ensure that products are completely free of residues; however, methods are used to minimize pollution from air, soil and water.the principal guidelines for organic production are to use materials and practices that enhance the ecological balance of natural systems and that integrate the parts of the farming system into an ecological whole.hemp is a fast growing and relatively pest free plant, making it a good ecological choice for sustainable textiles.cotton - production of conventional cotton uses large amounts of pesticides, posing risks to farm workers, wildlife, the environment, and the end user.usda national organic standards board (nosb) definition, april 1995 organic agriculture is an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity.wood biodegrades slowly, but the process can be hastened by making wood chips which can be used as mulch or added to a compost pile.organic food handlers, processors and retailers adhere to standards that maintain the integrity of organic agricultural products.many of the products will not compost as quickly as the certified compostables or food scraps, but will degrade over a longer period of time and will not contribute to our waste stream.the materials and ingredients are either naturally-occurring products known to biodegrade (e.g., wood) or are naturally-occurring components of soil (e.g., minerals).for example, some compostable plastics will only biodegrade under conditions of high heat such as the temperatures obtained in a municipal or commercial composting facility.when possible, we source products that are made from wood that comes fromforest stewardship council certified wood, which assures that the wood "comes from forests that are managed to meet the social, economic, and ecological needs of present and future generations".in a commercial or municipal aerobic composting facility products meeting these requirements will: biodegrade under composting conditions at a rate comparable to known compostable materials.we require processing of wool to be certified organic or consistent with organic standards but do not require wool to be from organic farms as we do not believe that it is always in the best interest of the animal.
