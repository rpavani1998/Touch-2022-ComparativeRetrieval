the main ones being the ground remains moist as it prevents evaporation and saves frequent watering, this means less water wasted but also lessweeds that would hinder germination.
many vegetal species can be used as mulch but the cover can also be composed of synthetic material.
it also saves money as less water is needed, no fertilizers and no need to take organicwastes to the local dump.
pine barks on a clump of young perennials.
rcw helps pedogenesis which is necessary to the formation of humus.
the mulch can be set any time of the year except in winter, this can be done manually or using a trowel for tiny patches so as to lay an even cover about 4 to 5 inches thick.
components derived from conifers provoke acidification, so they're not suitable for all plants but are good for heath plants.
the mulch will decay and rot, providing humus to the soil ; thanks to these natural nutrients, chemical ones are useless so it's also a means to contribute to the preservation of microfauna.

[edit] setting before setting the mulch, the soil should be hoed about 5 inches deep.
it's always better to use local species rather than imported materials from tropical plants such as cacao pods which are much more expensive.
it's better not to form little heaps around the plants to avoid an excess of moisture.
besides being environment friendly, this technique also has advantages for the gardener who saves time : no need to weed, hoe or till, thus less soil erosion.

double mulch combines the benefits of two complementary mulches, e.g. dead leaves create humus but will easily be blown by the wind so covering these with homecompost will protect this first layer.
it also saves money as less water is needed, no fertilizers and no need to take organicwastes to the local dump.
ramial chipped wood (rcw) is the name given to chipped branches of deciduous trees of less than 3 inches in diameter, pinales can be mixed, up to 20%.
by extension, rcw also refers to innovative agricultural methods, the use of chipped wood as an upper layer or as mulch will recreate a "forest floor".
