they are very corrosive to concrete and metal, can burn plants and contribute to waterway pollution.this results in excessive nutrient runoff and water pollution.compost compost contains major and minor nutrients important for plant growth and can be used in flower, herb and vegetable beds to substitute for commercial fertilizers.fertilizing in the spring encourages rapid succulent growth that is more susceptible to attack by insects and disease.it could promote new growth at a time when perennial plants are beginning to enter dormancy and could result in increased winter damage.overuse of fertilizers may contribute to groundwater pollution.adding organic matter in the form of composted leaves, manure, grass clippings, etc. will improve soil structure and attract earthworms.very large mulch piles may undergo anaerobic digestion leading to the formation of compounds like ethanol and methanol that can damage plants.overuse of nitrogen fertilizers may contribute to groundwater pollution.the fertilizer can cause browning of nearby landscape plants and is corrosive to concrete and metal.a good mulch covering will help plants survive the stress of summer and keep weeds in check.bare soil, especially on slopes is prone to erosion and should be covered with mulch, groundcovers or turf.not only do they pollute the watershed, they are corrosive to concrete and metal, and can burn plants..soil - adding organic matter in the form of composted leaves, composted manure, chopped up spent flowers and vegetable plants, grass clippings, etc. will improve soil structure, increase soil fertility and help you produce healthier plants.over-fertilization, especially with fertilizers that are high in nitrogen, can lead to overly succulent, weak growth and encourage sucking insect pests like scales, aphids and adelgids.
