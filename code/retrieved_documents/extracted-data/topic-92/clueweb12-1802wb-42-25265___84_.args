a healthy population of soil microorganisms can also maintain ecological balance, preventing the onset of major problems from viruses or other pathogens that reside in the soil.conserving existing topsoil and organic matter is a key practice to protect existing populations of beneficial microorganisms.conserving and utilizing healthy topsoil will also help to sustain the natural populations of beneficial microorganisms.constructed wetlands can create favorable habitat for unique flora and fauna.the heat generated during composting effectively reduces pathogens, weeds, and insects that may be hazardous to humans and detrimental to reestablishing vegetation.composts are very suitable materials for increasing the water-holding capacity of sandy soils, increasing nutrient supply, and enhancing soil infiltration and permeability rates.therefore, use of nitrogen-fixing plants can be an important part of accelerating rehabilitation of degraded land.this is one reason why trackwalking has been considered beneficial for erosion control and revegetation because it does create a somewhat better "short-term" growing environment and reduces surface erosion and sedimentation on a very poor site.compaction will affect surface infiltration and runoff, therefore, trackwalking should be critically evaluated for its potential increase in soil erosion.applications of certain herbicides, pesticides, insecticides, fungicides, and nematicides are detrimental to mycorrhizal fungi.as discussed in section 5.8.1.2, mulch materials with high c:n discourage growth of weedy annuals because high c:n materials remove available nitrogen that would otherwise give these species a competitive advantage.in addition, long-fibered mulches can mitigate the effects of frost heaving at the soil surface (kay 1978), significantly reduce high surface temperatures (slick and curtis 1985), and allow sunlight penetration, which enhances seed germination and seedling establishment.mulches therefore have many functions or roles in the recovery of native vegetation to a disturbed site.fertilizers are used to bring soil nutrients up to levels essential for establishing and maintaining a desired plant community.purchasing straw and hay â€” the drawbacks to using straw and hay are that these materials can contain seeds from undesirable species, are susceptible to wind movement, have limited application distance, and decompose in a relatively short time compared to other mulches.
