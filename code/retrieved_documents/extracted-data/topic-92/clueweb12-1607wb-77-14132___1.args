nonflammable · not ideal for microbial growth · attractive appearance disadvantages · neither sand nor gravel is considered an (ada) accessible playground surfacing.
· displacement of materials is not an issue, so the protective ability of these surfaces remains consistent even in high-traffic areas.
surface maintenance schedules note: this table shows typical maintenance frequencies.
although both tile and pip are generally made with the same types of raw materials, the cost savings are realized in production efficiencies, lower installation cost as well as longevity of the pre-manufactured product.
