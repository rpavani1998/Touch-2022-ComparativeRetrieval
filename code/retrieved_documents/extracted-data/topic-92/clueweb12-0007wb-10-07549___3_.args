the mulch will decay and rot, providing humus to the soil ; thanks to these natural nutrients, chemical ones are useless so it's also a means to contribute to the preservation of microfauna.the mulch will decay and rot, providing humus to the soil ; thanks to these natural nutrients, chemical ones are useless so it's also a means to contribute to the preservation of microfauna.components derived from conifers provoke acidification, so they're not suitable for all plants but are good for heath plants.besides being environment friendly, this technique also has advantages for the gardener who saves time : no need to weed, hoe or till, thus less soil erosion.besides being environment friendly, this technique also has advantages for the gardener who saves time : no need to weed, hoe or till, thus less soil erosion.double mulch combines the benefits of two complementary mulches, e.g. dead leaves create humus but will easily be blown by the wind so covering these with homecompost will protect this first layer.[edit] double mulch double mulch combines the benefits of two complementary mulches, e.g. dead leaves create humus but will easily be blown by the wind so covering these with homecompost will protect this first layer.this technique has many advantages for the gardener as well as for the environment.laying organic wastes as mulch enables the gardener to recycle them.it also saves money as less water is needed, no fertilizers and no need to take organicwastes to the local dump.many vegetal species can be used as mulch but the cover can also be composed of synthetic material.by extension, rcw also refers to innovative agricultural methods, the use of chipped wood as an upper layer or as mulch will recreate a "forest floor".the main ones being the ground remains moist as it prevents evaporation and saves frequent watering, this means less water wasted but also lessweeds that would hinder germination.it's always better to use local species rather than imported materials from tropical plants such as cacao pods which are much more expensive.mulching consists in laying an organic cover around plants (usuallystraw).
