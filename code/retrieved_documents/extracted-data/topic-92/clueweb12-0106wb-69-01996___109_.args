given an extended family, a bioregional network locally, and some form of common work opportunity, any individual is assured of access to resources, capital, cultural exchanges, and good work.such integrations are conducive to the development of complementary skills in the neighbourhood.as we cannot predict effects on fisheries or crops, diverse planning will be needed to establish inland aquacultures, forests, and gardens; economic species should be collected and preserved for future changes.wherever possible, life, work, and recreation should be integrated in a dwelling; not only are households better informed, children less alienated, and adults less isolated from social contact, but the need for complex transport systems is eliminated.by establishing a land trust, they can legally encourage others to develop parts of the property, and so set up a socially rich area with multiple potential.we know how to solve every food, clean energy, and sensible shelter problem in every climate: we have already invented and tested every necessary technique 'and technical device, and have access to all the biological material that we could ever use.it is also advantageous that wood, wind, solar, or high-pressure water is available for energy production, and that clear ideas of how clean energy can be obtained, or developed and maintained, is part of the design.conscientious use of a credit union by village residents would greatly increase capital flow to village enterprises.with sound ethics and resource usage restrictions, any financial institution can prevent leakage of wealth and the erosion of basic resources, so that it is itself an asset to community, and builds wealth for re-investment.in fact, fair or normal profits can be used to benefit both people and land, can give young or poorer people titles, and can rehabilitate landscapes otherwise neglected.aid-financed deep wells and pumps in the same region have enabled large livestock herds and more annual cropping at the cost of a rapidly falling water table.all these guard resources for future use, and are essential to a sustainable system.in this way, we can build a global, interdependent, and cooperative body of people involved in ethical land and resource use, whose teaching is founded on research but is also locally available everywhere, and locally demonstrable in many thousands of small enterprises covering the whole range of human endeavours, from primary production to quaternary system management; from domestic nutrition and economy to a global network of small financial systems.as and when independent villages do achieve an identity, an ethic, and unity, beneficial connections can be made ranging from radio and land links to bulk purchase, trade, and share facilities, so that coastal, urban, arid, tropical, and primarily rural villages can access and share the resources of others on an agreed-upon lease, hire, or exchange basis.all these strategies enrich village or regional life, and give access to a wider world; this is particularly important for children and young people.
