because wildfire is a major carbon source, reducing wildfire can help to control carbon emissions from the forest.this can reduce wildfire carbon emissions by as much as 50 percent.biomass heating could provide markets to facilitate forest fire fuel reduction and salvage of beetle-killed wood in colorado and other western states.recycling small diameter forest products is one answer that could help reduce the risk, and therefore the costs, of catastrophic wildfire in wildland-urban interface, while providing renewable energy.removing the encroaching conifers through forest thinning is needed to restore and help protect remaining old growth forests.without restoration treatments, old-growth forests in dry regions of the west are at considerable risk.burning wood for energy is, of course, an ancient technology, but as steven bick points out in anew perc case study, wood can provide an economic and environmentally viable solution for high heating costs in many parts of the country.at seasons end, real trees can be recycled and used for making everything from mulch to medicines, or to enhance wildlife habitat and prevent erosion.in recent years that has meant less harvest and more timber mortality, which, at least in part, has added to the high fire risk that exists in the forests.net carbon from a forest is sensitive to natural conditions, forest disturbance, and forest management activities.national forest timber harvest peaked in 1987 when harvest provided about 17 percent of u.s. timber production: during the peak of timber harvest for the forest service, more than half the annual timber growth was harvested and used for timber products, the mortality rate was about 32 percent.by crafting a fine product that displays tree ring history, the low value of the small diameter trees can be greatly enhanced to provide the necessary economic incentive to accomplish restoration.wildfire, for example, contributes about 5 percent as much emissions as does the nationâ€™s coal production each year.in 2007, only 12 percent of national forest growing stock was removed from the forest and mortality increased to 57 percent.artificial trees are not biodegradable, nor are they a good fuel source.
