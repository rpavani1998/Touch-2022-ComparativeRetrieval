given an optimistic overall market outlook, model results indicate potential for expansion of total wood harvest in the west if fuel treatment programs will permit significantly expanded wood supply from forest thinning, in which case fuel treatment programs could partially displace timber harvest from conventional supply sources (mainly state and private forestlands), reduce timber prices, and offset regional timber revenues, while expanding regional forest product output.increasing wood fuel use, a carbon-neutral process, would decrease the environmental impact of hardwood lumber manufacturing and increase its value as a green building material.forests as a whole provide vital ecosystem services, as important atmospheric carbon sinks for example.increasing wood fuel use, a carbon-neutral process, would lower the environmental impact of hardwood lumber manufacturing and increase its use as a green building material.increasing wood fuel use, a carbon-neutral process, would decrease the environmental impact of hardwood lumber manufacturing and increase its use as a green building material.certifying wood products as green building materials is vital for the long-term productivity of the wood building industry and for forest management.because forest carbon loss contributes to increasing climate risk and because climate changemay impede regeneration following disturbance, avoiding deforestation and promoting regeneration after disturbance should receive high priority as policy considerations.we found that many strategies can increase forest sector carbon mitigation above the current 162-256 tg c/yr, and that many strategies have co-benefits such as biodiversity, water, and economic opportunities.to experienced administrators, conditions necessary for a successful research enterprise focused on wood utilization and product development include clarity in purpose and well-defined client groups, effective governing boards and advisory committees, visionary and enthusiastic administrators, talented and risk taking scientists, satisfied research clients and customers, and research contributions that add to the scientific foundation considered necessary to enhance the efficient use of wood.mechanization is frequently necessary to perform cost-effective and safe operations.activities that contribute to helping forests adapt to the effects of climate change, and which also complement forest carbon storage strategies, would be prudent.forest resources also have alternative values in society because they produce other important services such as recreational, spiritual, environmental, or aesthetic services.however, a natural forest will likely have high value to society in terms of ecological or aesthetic amenities.the mountain pine beetle epidemic that rages in british columbia, canada continues, with approximately 4.8 million hectares of forestland currently infested and government policies regarding harvesting approaches being enacted as rapidly as possible.because mechanical thinning is costly, developing markets for removed wood as fuel for community energy applications is one way to support the economics of forest management while saving money for communities.
