organic matter is a source of plant nutrients and provides an ideal environment for earthworms and other beneficial soil organisms.compost not only improves the soil structure but provides an excellent source of plant nutrients.this improves root growth, increases the infiltration of water, and also improves the water-holding capacity of the soil.mulches, by providing an insulating barrier between the soil and the air, moderate the soil temperature.mulching helps prevent the rapid fluctuations in soil temperature and reduces the chances of heaving.the barrier between the soil and the mulch also prevents any improvement in the soil condition and makes planting additional plants more difficult.pine needles tend to increase the acidity of the soil so they work best around acid-loving plants such as rhododendrons and blueberries.drought-stressed lawns are more susceptible to chinch bug infections.as hardy as it is attractive, empire has a deep, thick root structure, and is more drought tolerant than most varieties of zoysia once established.most warm-season grasses have very poor cold tolerance ratings and enter a state of dormancy or a reduction in growth and metabolism in the fall.overwatering can lead to fungus outbreaks.as these mulches slowly decompose, they provide organic matter which helps keep the soil loose.one of the benefits from winter applications of mulch is the reduction in the freezing and thawing of the soil in the late winter and early spring.cool-season turfgrasses need about three times more water than warm-season turfgrasses to produce equal amounts of shoot and root tissue.mulch protects the soil from erosion reduces compaction from the impact of heavy rains conserves moisture, reducing the need for frequent waterings maintains a more even soil temperature prevents weed growth keeps fruits and vegetables clean keeps feet clean, allowing access to garden even when damp provides a “finished” look to the garden organic mulches also improve the condition of the soil.
