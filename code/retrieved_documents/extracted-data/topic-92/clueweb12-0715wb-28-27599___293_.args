the economic and social costs associated with the deaths and serious injuries of young workers are substantial.collectively, they would not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy or its individual sectors, productivity, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities.moreover, the amendment's strong safety-affecting requirements that such youth not operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines, use personal protective equipment to prevent exposure to excessive levels of noise and sawdust, and be protected from wood particles and other flying debris within the workplace, should significantly reduce potential costs resulting from accidents and injuries to minors on the job.lack of experience in the work place and in assessing risks, and developmental factors--physical, cognitive, and psychological--all contribute to the higher rates of occupational injuries and deaths experienced by young workers.in fact, ensuring that permissible job opportunities for working youth are safe, healthy, and not detrimental to their education, as required by the statute, produces many positive benefits in addition to fewer occupational injuries and deaths, including reduced health and productivity costs that employers may otherwise incur because of higher accident and injury rates to young and inexperienced workers.the report also documents that the forestry industry has a high fatality rate as well, and workers face injury risks similar to those of logging workers.in addition, there are a number of diverse and serious health hazards associated with the slaughtering of animals and manufacturing of meat products, including exposure to infectious agents and respiratory hazards.it would not likely result in: (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of u.s.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.the report notes that investigations of baler-related incidents show that failure to maintain machinery in safe operating condition contributes to fatalities and serious injuries and that neither adult supervisors nor young workers may fully appreciate the risks posed by uncontrolled hazardous energy.an employer's violation of section 12 or section 13(c) of the act relating to child labor or any regulation issued pursuant to such sections, shall be deemed to be willful for purposes of this section where the employer knew that its conduct was prohibited by the act or showed reckless disregard for the requirements of the act.as an estimated one-third of work-related injuries are seen in emergency departments, it is likely that approximately 146,000 youth sustain work-related injuries and illnesses each year.if fatalities result from recognized illegal activities, such as working with fireworks or a power-driven circular saw, the best strategy for preventing future injuries may not be to revise the regulations but to increase compliance with existing laws through public awareness initiatives, targeted compliance assistance efforts, and stepped-up enforcement activities.it is important to note that this requirement of close, direct, and uninterrupted supervision, just like the requirement that youth not operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machinery, applies to the employment of 16- and 17-year- olds as well as 14- and 15-year-olds.the niosh statistics show that, despite the fact that workers aged 15 through 17 are generally restricted from employment in hazardous occupations such as mining, motor-vehicle driving, logging, sawmilling, and construction, they have a higher rate of injuries requiring emergency room treatment than any other age group except 18- and 19-year-olds (who are not restricted from performing such work).section 13(c)(7) of the flsa provides a limited exemption from the child labor provisions for certain youths between the ages of 14 and 18 years who, by statute or judicial order, are excused from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade, that permits their employment inside and outside of places of business that use power- driven machinery to process wood products.
