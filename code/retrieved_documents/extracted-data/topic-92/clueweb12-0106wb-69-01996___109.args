no other, and no mixed loads are collected.
the trust can inform investors of any opportunity for their involvement at any level from volunteer or recreational use to paid consultancy, building, or in leaseholds available.

multi-racial, multi-cultural, and multi-occupational families and global nations obliterates these "defended territories" and suits peaceful lifestyles.
as these meetings are pleasant, we can look forward to them, and so a pleasant and informative occasion replaces a frustrating and stressful "group decision" meeting.
in addition to normal business principles, the more intense and more democratic operation of cooperatives demands that co-op staff must participate in planning, seriously contributing to policy, procedures, and inno- vations.
in the case of capable farmers, they can themselves be appointed as co-managers, and many would gladly accept this role in restoration and earth care.
eucalypt monoculture for rayon fibre (textiles) has obliterated many ragi fields, and in total this may add up to a deferred catastrophe.

the worker is, in effect, "loaning" the cooperative the money, and so receives interest.
conscientious use of a credit union by village residents would greatly increase capital flow to village enterprises.
in this way, every person who wants to work controls their work, and non-involved people have no say.
if taxes were not in fact so used, we would all live in a society where the need to work would be negligible, and both employment and unemployment (thus, workers and owners) absent.
through the designers, users can obtain help in buil9ing and land design, nursery and livestock services, and appropriate tools.

the group in charge of administering the loan checks references, offers advice, and .acts on the recommendation of people who will service the loan (usually a skills or research group of volunteers, some of whom may take part in, or service, the business).
exchange can still take place, but it is accounted for in terms of stocks or services.
most customers will deal with a firm over and over again if it proves to be reliable, rather than take a chance with a company which may be cheap, but which maintains such sloppy standards as slow service and shoddy products.
a great benefit to having many business offices located in one place is the increased number of consumers and the ability to concentrate many products in a single product catalogue.

a company does not die, unlike its directors, and the small group of trustees can act quickly and decisively without reference to the cumbersome and often uninvolved "board of directors" that some trusts have appointed.
money borrowed in order to save money is soon repaid, and so is safe to lend.
all money arises from the wealth of the natural world (plants, clean water, clear air, stored energy).
in this way, total failure is unlikely, as is unemployment.
6.3 hydrological and water supply services (dams, domestic water), design and implementation.
most human communities function in relation to a long-term sustainablility only because they do differ from others; what is possible to an inuit (eskimo) is not possible to a forest pygmy.

each area of action can have a basically independent management sub-group, reporting to council regularly.
sell to prospective buyers, using a trust fund for road, water, and site preparation.
now, any community printing its own currency has these things to do: find and lease a resource that can be pledged to the exchange institution as a redeemable asset.
the group purchasing is held totally and individually responsible for payment for any item.
an example of this sort is if a group of five wanted to purchase a large brush chipper to create compost for themselves and to hire out to others in the community.

the very powerful principle here is that "everything must pay"; more specifically, in community enterprises "proposers pay capital" and "users pay costs".
just as we can select from all extant ethics and beliefs those elements that we see to be sustainable, useful, and beneficial to life and to our community.
thus, the very first strategies we need are those that put our own house in order, and at the same time do not give credibility to distant power-centred or unethical systems.
it is probable that the ww group sets up sales, ads, investment in the first place, and acts for the enterprise in their country, thus generating capital.

towns and cities as farms: a twist on the above, which can be operated by a city farm group.
these represent a good medium to swap goods in particular, with the barter centre charging only on a proportion of successful swaps.
above all, a land trust should have a very clear idea of what it wants to achieve, and to set a practical time limit to do the job.
the very concepts of employment/unemployment deny this potential, and again frustrate people so that rebellion as strikes or riots follow.
this quickly points the way to local self-reliance strategies.
2.4 useful native species collections and reserves, potential for cultivation.
in my view, the neighbourhood factor-knowledge of each other's names-is a primary factor, and has proved to be a major factor in survival in disaster, as assessed (e.g.) in the 1967 hobart fires, where casualties in "anonymous" areas and commuter suburbs were many times higher than in neighbourhoods where people knew and cared for others.
the sharing of "power" is really a sharing of responsibility; part of that responsibility is the capital risk of any enterprise.
imports are greatly decreased, local employment rises rapidly, good products {and security) are available, and community morale is enhanced.
when we replace agriculture with gardens, then we should close down, as a priority, the most distant or most damaging agricultures.
while natural resources fuel such "wealth", artisans and architects develop the monuments, artists decorate them, and bankers, miners, and oil people fund or value them.
(security here means a cooperative neighbourhood and ample, sustainable resources for people.)
producers of local goods, accept local currency only; this creates a demand, and other regions must "buy" such currency to obtain local goods.
moreover, state or private ownership (versus community ownership) of forests, small mines, and lands is devoted to state or corporate profits to support a largely urban, leisured class of bureaucrats, which denies these basic biological and earth resources to the very people who work to produce or mine them.
the essentials of an ethical banking system is not only that it has an ethical charter and is used for appropriate assets, but that it belongs to and is governed by the commnity it serves, and therefore is not open to distant or centralised control.
advisors" are short-term, and if they do not leave a corps of well-informed people, are of i ephemeral effect; even such a basic technology as a water tap needs a trades-person capable of descaling vents and reseating valves, or replacing washers over the long term.
4.5 processed-product producers in region.
this can be borrowed from the bank or obtained by installments deducted from wages over a two-year period.
people buy or preprchase the book at a slightly reduced price, which enables the publisher to print the book (this is how the book you are reading was printed) in another example, a restaurant (zoo zoos) in washington state, usa, in transferring from single ownership to a work cooperative, needed to raise funds to buyout the owner.
satisfying the demand (e.g. for homes) by lending the currency to builders, who can exchange it at the bank for other currency needed in trade, or locally for products and services

1.9 standard documents and data sheets available via the bioregional centre.
the seller may retain a house title on the land if so required, and the price is then discounted.

green dollars are "earned" by goods or services to others, and "lost" by using services or goods.
although tribal peoples had (and have) a clear idea of total ecologies-the sum of fire, regrowth, wallaby, and pioneer fire species-arid although they had a word for this, there is no word-concept for a "total human family " ecology" beyond "a living".
however, we need a redeemable, solid, real and objective currency for trade and exchange.
the real saving to small businesses is shared facilities such as premises, accounting, and office services.

it is a clear legal access to forage, and a registered and secure bee site; and it is the tight to sell or market product to pay for other ijfe needs.
practical warnings are not to accept land gifts that have many restrictive conditions attached; in fact, it is wise to perhaps limit acceptance to unconditional gifts.
this basic design work completed, the trust or owners can advertise locally for people to run any one of these enterprises with levels ranging from that of a hobby (developing a butterfly forage system) to a fulltime occupation income (a trout farm).proper legal saeguards (lease documents) setting out rights of use, length of lease, responsibilities of the trust and lessee, and terms of payment (adjustable, but usually 10% of gross income) are drawn up to safeguard users.
thus, the work force has total control over the composition of representatives, rather like a bioregion.
so "improvements" in short-term finances (to large landowners or industrialists) add up to a greatly impoverished population and environment; in short, desertification due to improvements".
curiously, we are drafted to kill strangers, and denied the right to preserve life; no armies are created to build houses, grow potatoes, or plant forests for the future; unemployment for others is preferred by those who choose power as a method of exploitation.
thus, "users pay" should apply at every level of community, except for hardship or welfare services.
when we discuss the principle of "commonwork", or study the varied 'roles of an individual in a village, we can see that no person is just a miner, or clerk, or banker, but that on different days one can be a banker, forester, bee-keeper, writer, printer, or carpenter.

there is a labour organiser in the group to sort out the balance of payments, and to despatch labourers to a recipient (who must have at least 60 hours in credit).
many problems are very long-term, and short-term aid (typical of emergency programmes) is not able to address these; drought has an 18-20 year periodicity, and needs to be coped with by food storages on good years, emergency food and forage from tree crop, pre-drought reduction of herds, widespread rainfall harve!!ting systems, and a well-informed public assisted by appropriate policy such as equable adjustment of livestock herd size, and government aid to establish drought refuges locally for essential livestock and for people.
all these guard resources for future use, and are essential to a sustainable system.
intermarriage, visits, mutual trade and aid, skills exchange, and educational exchange between regions of very different cultures enriches both.
by improving properties so purchased, their value increases, and (under present rulings) taxation is not incurred on that increase in value if the property is held for 10 or more years, nor is the trust itself taxed on its income from investors.
ownership, in effect, gives the titleholder (person or state) a "right to exploit in the short term".
tribal maps often defined bioregions very well; totems and "skins" (clan groups) of tribes might take, as their totemic mothers, a particular tree or animal, which itself was limited in distribution by the sum of topographic and climatic factors.
if these have increased in yield and maintained in species, the area maintains health.
apart from the asset categories given above, careful consideration must be given by any bioregion to what is locally conserved and used (the basis of regional wealth, such as soil) and what can be exported as a trade item (surplus water or surplus manufacture).
where relief benefits are paid, the state rewards people to accept this role of "no work" , and in effect fines them if they work.
information (education and data), plus applied intelligence makes the best use of all assets, decides balances in the asset base, assesses future trends, and foresees needs and changes.
the borrowing criteria is that the entrepreneur must be willing to work closely and regularly with celt during the loan so that a business has the greatest chance to succeed.
if the beneficiaries are individuals, such gifts are taxed as private income; if the beneficiaries are charitable trusts or churches, the gift is not only not taxable but can be tax deductible to any giver.

at 2,000 people, theft and competitiveness is more common, and sects set up in opposition-the 'ecumenial alliances" are lost.
lifetime is that little space we are given to experience this world, which shapes up to, what we can imagine to be heaven, but where the achievement of paradise is constantly set back by the "serpents" of greed, power, stupid exploitation, and war.
by avoiding centralised administrations, we avoid power blocs, and by avoiding tax funding, we avoid inefficiency.
a property trust purchases real estate for improvement, lease, or rental on behalf of many small investors who cannot afford to individually own or develop such properties.
wherever there is a need (for housing, roads, small businesses, farms), the dollars needed are supplied by the exchange, but the borrower or user must repay in local currency, thus creating a demand for it.
with a common interest and ethical base, cooperative interdependence supplants competition.

like landscape planning, there are community systems which can cause more time spent in conflict than can be made up later; such errors we can still call primary errors as they will lead to constant problems and expense later.
there is no substitute for thorough analysis of soils and foods, the use of trace elements or soil additives, respect for traditional methods of food preparation, and an excellent education to accompany the project.
in effect, any member (by working or selling) issues their own currency, and could return any community to full employment.
in practice, any person has 3-5 close friends (who change slowly over time), a support group of 30 or more acquaintances, and resource access to the whole system.
the local nees to primary processing, building, and consultancy or implementation servies can also be researched.
it is an invaluable experience to model such a property trust, and to teach others how to follow any successes that we achieve.
the job of the bioregional office is complex, and it needs 4-6 people to act as consultants and coordinators, with others on call when needed.
the units of exchange are hours of labour, and all labour is considered equal.
bioregionalism is an excellent concept, given the irrational land use systems and land divisions developed by the present power structures.
the farmer adjusts production to suit family needs, and as the "link" grows, the system can also accommodate holidays on the farm, educational workshops, and city help on the farm at peak work periods (planting and harvesting).
such initiatives have in fact cmmenced in the amerindian groups subject to national (i.e. political) oppression in both north and south america.
families can, for instance, maintain a student dormitory near secondary or tertiary institutes, whereas at present many rural families have no such facility to send children ages 12 or over when they need or request higher education.
any isociety that develops lawns beyond those used for figure 14.14 (trusteeship of land)
it must be stressed that the "revolving loans office" is not a place but a group in cooperative function.
surplus or savings out of the operation of the cooperative belong to members (with members to decide on the use of the surplus, whether to develop the business, to provide common services for members, and/or to distribute among members according to the degree of involvement in the cooperative).
not only corporations but volunteer groups and consumer groups produce monitoring publications on multinationals on a global scale, and publish "nonbuyers" guides of the products of unethical organisations.
a community may have at least these formal structures coopratives a cooperative is a group of people acting together for the benefit of members.
type 2 is probably the easiest to plan and administer, and allows a whole graduation of involvement and committment.
note: until the above listing is made, no region can assess health priorities.
the trust can gift land to other regional trusts or associations of whocm it approves, so that local gifts can be routed through a tax-deductible trust.

in the first trust of this type, the aim can be to stop accepting investors at $2-5 million, which will develop a property or properties as listed in the prospectus.
members of the community can become s.h.a.r.e. members, which means they open a s.h.a.r.e. joint account with the bank.
no isolated or scattered group of people can self provide for the above, but it is probable that about 30 to 200 houses can support these services and basic facilities, especially if there is planning for cooperative funding.

we should develop or create wealth just as we develop landscapes, by concentrating on conservation of energy and natural resources (reducing the need to earn), by developing procreative assets (proliferating forests, prairies, and life systems), by reducing the creation of degenerative assets (roads, monuments, cities), and by constantly divesting ourselves of any surplus wealth to these ends.
only members can trade with each other, the community account is at all times balanced.
this right, and many similar rights, overlay all landscapes, all societies, but can only be designed to be beneficial if that society (or that segment of society who want self-reliance) entrust their lands and lives to a public-interest deed of trust, and also trust each other to carry out a function.

the community has cooperative schools, hospitals, a university, housing, health and welfare services, a technical research laboratory, super-markets, banks, and computer centres; all of these are cooperatives, and schools earn part of their costs by contract to manufacturing cooperatives.
imports are greatly decreased, local employment rises rapidly, good products {and security) are available, and community morale is enhanced.
unless the formation of trusts is a common practice in a particular country, very few lawyers can set up (or even know about) trusts.
a cooperatively run bank oversees the functioning of all new cooperatives in the group, finances new cooperatives (up to 90%}, and offers expert managment skills.
fiscal management, like energy management, also needs social, environmental, and ethical accounting.
only the corruption of fund managers would prevent such sensible provision for future work, and corruption cannot be exposed without investor pressure.
20% of the profits are held as capital reserves, and 70% are distributed to workers, although not all of this is available for withdrawal until a worker leaves the cooperative, at which point all of their financial interest in the business must be withdrawn.

as money begins to flow to regional and socially responsible funds, even those people not personally persuaded of the need to invest in the future will have cause to think about investing in unethical systems from which public and financial support is being withdrawn, pursued vigorously as a strategy, reinvestment in ethical systems can change the total direction of capital flow towards beneficial systems.
money is of no use if its ends are destructive to society, life forms, or values.
the only way to do this is to establish fin~ncial and economic systems onsite, such as a credit union, revolving loan fund, or local currency.

in fact, as soon as possible after the developers pay land and developmental costs, they should seek to have village trustees elected.
so, sensible smallscale and cost--effective solutions are prevented or actively discouraged by governments and fiscal managers alike.

the tragic reality is that very few sustainable systems are designed or applied by those who hold power, and the reason for this is obvious and simple: to let people arrange their own food, energy, and shelter is to lose economic and political control over them.
worker-based clubs usually develop private plots with overnight (caravan-style) accommodation for weekends.
these enterprises depend on two basic factors: capital (enough money to start up and develop), and management (careful accounting, forward planning, market research and development, product development, sensible costing and staffing, correct lease and rental agreements, appropriate legal structures); thus a small business service centre is economical and necessary for 20 or more businesses.
this can be called a loans trust, credit union, finance cooperative or enterprise fund pool; it can include barter, a labour exchange, a regular fair or market, and it needs an open register of local skills and resources, well displayed.
thus, many young families get legal access to garden land, on an "allotment" basis.
the whole development group thus evolved can then purchase lands, capitalise them, and get them in order as a complex of lake, forest, and village settlement.

households: basically consumers, each household pays a nominal joining fee, goods are bought at a discount, and an annual dividend is received for the bulk purchases over the year.
the work of the bioregional group is to assess the natural, technical, service, and financial resources of the region, and to identify areas where leakage of resources (water, soil, money, talent) leave the region.
any such library of solutions needs an educational outreach.

if we are one isolated a biodynamic gardener in a district of contract vegetable growers or graziers trained in chemical agriculture, we find both the practice and infrastructure support of the isolated system difficult; there may be no one to talk to, let alone share resources with.
money itself is not a resource, and has no intrinsic value or use, but it can create categories of resources or assets, which we can identify as follows (after turnbull, 1975): *degenerative: those assets that decay, rust, or wear out: the buildings, roads, cars, furnishings, and appliances of society.

through global associations and "families of common interest" we cross not only the regional but also state and national borders to set up multicultural alliances.
a balanced life has all three outlets, so that contented people may spend part of their time in: physical exertion (walking, gardening, sport); intellectual pursuits (design, research, education); and emotional-sensual areas (celebration, ontemplation, love).
the large amount of investment capital redirected hrough ethical brokerages is the tip of an iceberg which involves many thousands of ordinary people who are members of guarantee circles, ethical credit mions,community loans trusts, common fund agencies or bioregions, or non formal systems of labour and workday exchanges, barter systems, direct market systems, or no-interest, pre-purchase, "green dollar" systems, moreover, existing banks, credit unions, cooperatives, businesses, and allied groups are discussing the rewriting of their charters to include the values of earth care, people care, and the production of socially useful or socilally sensitive) products, some credit unions and banks already have such a charter, and keep corporate watchdogs on the staff whose sole job it is to monitor companies for unethical behaviour.
an even greater saving is realised by a modest tractor-tool-truck hire services, in which trust b leases these infrequently used assets to residents as needed.

it is not a bank or finance company, and so loans through the s.c.c.e. are not secured.
by allotting 30% of sites to the body corporate (trust a), the developers ensure that: the trust can use this asset in many ways, but would be most effective in ensuring either conservation of energy or business development on site, and in using the common wealth for increasing local productive assets if a credit union has been established, much of the trust capital can be transferred to a loans account, so that residents can draw on it at low interest for local occupational development.
most of what makes a successful business is the combination of human-centred values with good management, which we have listed below (paraphrasing from the findings of the book in search of excellence by t. peters and r. waterman, 1984, harper & row).

if people who really want land set up adetermined research group on "ways and means", or open an advisory centre on such methords, they would achieve their needs much faster and with far less expense than if they rely on undertaking a political "revolution" (a transfer of power), or saved their pennies, and with much greater longterm benefit to society.
often, however, that resource is a useless object (a diamond) which people rarely find a need for in any lifethreatening crisis, and never in any global crisis such as now threatens us.
practical warnings are not to accept land gifts that have many restrictive conditions attached; in fact, it is wise to perhaps limit acceptance to unconditional gifts.
secondly, other people must have confidence in it, which is why it is backed up by a local resource and can therefore be traded.
such systems are, like it or not, promoting antagonism and destroying cooperation and interdependence.
good accounting advice will often dictate that land should be creatively gifted to such a trust (i.e. it benefits the giver; this is especially true of donors who have a large income from other sources).
many can operate on site, and the cooperative store would serve as an outlet, or other leasehold retailers can offer goods and services for the village.

there are many good reasons to make the trustee a private company, as directors of such companies need to be few in number (3 or 4 are e enough), can appoint others if one dies or resigns, and can be anonymous.
it has long been apparent that our current political, economic, and landuse systems cannot solve such long-term and worsening problems as soil degradation, ground water pollution, forest decline, the spread of poverty, unemployment, and malnutrition (or its extreme, famine).
this may well be achieved by the "adoption" of a few acres of community forest by a household.
this can be called a loans trust, credit union, finance cooperative or enterprise fund pool; it can include barter, a labour exchange, a regular fair or market, and it needs an open register of local skills and resources, well displayed.
this is enough; others will have good ideas about small essential services and businesses, and the research group can be very busy researching and publicising "leaks" of money from the area, so that under or unemployed people can start up services and supplies to stop these leaks, e.g. does the area make its own bread, yoghurt, sausages, shoes, clothes, pots and paper?
when the trusts are formed to trade, they can take or own any business name that suits their work; such businesses are administered by a trustee.

secondly, other people must have confidence in it, which is why it is backed up by a local resource and can therefore be traded.
if taxes were not in fact so used, we would all live in a society where the need to work would be negligible, and both employment and unemployment (thus, workers and owners) absent.
the gross imbalance of wealth promotes "big" spending in capital-consuming but publicly paid investments (big dams, big power stations, big housing corporations) where governments refer the costs to the people.
the management group obtains backing from investors (via a public prospectus) to float a property trust on the investment market.
brokers or enterprise trusts can direct surplus investment to socially and environmentally responsible industries and developments such as new, well-designed villages.

it is the agent of transport, the shaper and mover of trade.
the office can handle the bookkeeping and serving of local industry and services, supply goods, advise, provide labour and goods exchange, and arrange legal forms.
thus, community savings and loans associations are appropriate for reducing community and household costs, and freeing more capital into the'community, which leads us to the s.h.a.r.e. and c.e.l.t. systems of "wealth-producing" loans.

in fact, fair or normal profits can be used to benefit both people and land, can give young or poorer people titles, and can rehabilitate landscapes otherwise neglected.
to control , the cash flow of our society is to control our lives.
as with money, land ownership and thus land usage in society is unbalanced, except where tribal land councils still exist; even in tribes, cattle or resource ownership can become unbalanced (as in botswana, where 9% of the people own 80% of the cattle) if crops and herds cease to be tribally owned and are privately c owned on common lands.
many of us have been locked in to unsatisfactory work or personal relationships, or too much alone in the context of nuclear family "ideals" , which in real societies are for the few.
many people with large incomes actually benefit from tax-deductible land gifts.
seeds have a high information content, as do books or data bases.
all organics are composted by a small tractor windrow system, and all oils are collected for re-sale as lubrication oils after filtration.
the establishment of a regional office (a land access office-lao) opens up the potential for offering a set of strategies enabling better land use, and suited to the finances and involvement of people using the service.

thus , in developing permaculture, we have the following factors in mind; perhaps we can approach the matter of successful aid defining what such a success would entail; by setting criteria for judging "success" .thus, successful aid should: problem areas are no place for fools, amateurs, or people who will not listen to others or assess results.
as and when independent villages do achieve an identity, an ethic, and unity, beneficial connections can be made ranging from radio and land links to bulk purchase, trade, and share facilities, so that coastal, urban, arid, tropical, and primarily rural villages can access and share the resources of others on an agreed-upon lease, hire, or exchange basis.

many failing logging companies have vast areas of degraded lands suited to small forest farm operations, and would-be forest farmers would love to manage a small area of forest properly, as would many theoreti- cal botanists and academics who have 1ong known how to develop a forest for eternal yield, but never had the land or capital to do so.
education and other work is funded by the interest from deposits and loans.
likewise, road, rail, boat, and not-too-distant air access are also advantageous for trade and travel.
the essentials of trust a are that it holds assets for the public good, does not take risks, and leases or rents to trust b, which does trade and take risks, and has trust a as one of its beneficiaries.
cooperatives also involve sharing, achieved by spreading the skills needed for anyone job over more than one person (rotating jobs); by having near equality in shareholding; and by being able therefore to assess how others are coping with a job.
as so few (dedicated) people can operate a trust effectively, it is far better to set up many such local trusts than to risk the power-centred inefficiences of a monstrous hierarchical system, such as some religious sects and foundations have become.

although tribal peoples had (and have) a clear idea of total ecologies-the sum of fire, regrowth, wallaby, and pioneer fire species-arid although they had a word for this, there is no word-concept for a "total human family " ecology" beyond "a living".
even here, every household can plant and tend an  area, and profit from or manage it; it is also an improving asset that can be sold or transferred.
if we close down farms and wasteproduct factories, we need to greatly enlarge true wilderness, for it is the ultimate grace to give room on earth to all living things, and the ultimate in modesty .to regard ourselves as stewards, not gods.

as the ethical investment process evolves, many more projects involving investors as residents, builders, primary producers, or suppliers of goods and services can be developed bioregional funds do, in fact, offer their investors chance to at least define the sort of goods they wan produced in their region, at the quality level the would prefer.
3.2 suppliers of safe control chemicals, traps.
thus the very concept of land ownership is ludicrous, and we need only to use what is needed for the brief time that we are here; even i birth and death are small events in a total life pool.
studies of such groups reveal that those who were effective adopted a set of values which ensured their continued internal and external interdependence; of those, perhaps the most important factor was that the group adopted "voluntary simplicity" as an ethic.

land trusts need be few, close to settlements, and cover all essential uses; the rest of the land can go back to natural forests or prairie.
certain behaviours occur at various group sizes; here are some approximate size and function groups: as even very small numbers of people (4-6) can be very effective, it is better to set up independent but friendly alliances of small groups than to coalesce into groups of 600 or more.
as with money, land ownership and thus land usage in society is unbalanced, except where tribal land councils still exist; even in tribes, cattle or resource ownership can become unbalanced (as in botswana, where 9% of the people own 80% of the cattle) if crops and herds cease to be tribally owned and are privately c owned on common lands.

thus, money advanced for gardens, fuel conservation, energy generation, or for appropriate vehicles and appliances is soon returned.
this would be an easier task if all intentional groups affiliated, and subscribed to a common policy; it is difficult for a small group to evolve a total policy in isolation, and a common policy statement sums up the skills of all groups.
this would, in effect, build fences, terraces, and eventually schools, workshops, and alternative energy systems.
