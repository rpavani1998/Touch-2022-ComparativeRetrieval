private ownership of cemeteries is not conducive to the best results as to permanency, and if permitted at all, should be under strict laws, and in what better way can our legislators show respect and reverence for the dead than by enacting such laws as will require the establishment of a permanent care fund in every cemetery.no matter how competent the superintendent is or how long his experience in cemetery work has been, his training is in the line of administration and development and the writer believes that in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred the aid of an experienced landscape gardener will be of untold value, not only to the superintendent himself but to those who employ him.treating customers with care, honesty and dignity helps us build ethical business practices and also helps us learn what standards to expect from ourselves.at the annual rate of destruction of our natural groves and woods for the purpose merely of material gain, the cemetery parks dotted over the countryside are timely substitutes for these in supplying important places of refuge for the encouragement of bird migration and reproduction; those indispensable friends of mankind which not only add joy to life by their presence but are such a large economic asset in the destruction of insect pests.the work which this association is accomplishing and has already accomplished in conserving and improving the landscape and in the encouragement of rural art is of the highest value in promoting aesthetic culture throughout the land.it provides nitrogen, holds water, prevents erosion and reduces weeds, to name a few benefits.herbicides, especially those used in lawns to kill dichotomous weeds (plants other than grass), can be a serious problem.mulch contaminated by herbicide may, in fact, poison the very plantings it is intended to help.this not only makes driving safer but saves the roads as well and will not mar the landscape when properly constructed.if all employees are truthful to each consumer about what they are buying and are honest about any mistakes made, they will be practicing good, ethical behavior.we know how pleasant and easy it is to receive people's money, and how uncertain and difficult it is to carry out the obligations assumed, especially in our severe and eccentric climate, but we must keep faith with the people, and secure to our citizens at least a burial place, indicating not only respect for the dead, but which will also be a source of pride and consolation to the living.it is also the imperative duty of certain employees and it is the privilege of all, to report to the committee any mishap, delay or other circumstances that may appear to be detrimental to the welfare of the cemetery.guided by the mistakes that have been made in our older cemeteries, we should try to secure for the future a method of treatment which will forbid all changes of grade, curbing, fences and over-planting.exposure to bloodborne pathogens is a significant risk to employees of the cemetery, funeral and crematory professions.there are fundamental laws governing business and an attempt on our part to acquire knowledge relating to these is of decided advantage to the corporation for whom we are working.
