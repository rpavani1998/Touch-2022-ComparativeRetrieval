while many of these innovations are deemed necessary for people to achieve comfort, enhanced productivity or increased goods and products, most carry with them high costs in terms of secondary toxic effects and resultant risks to health.health studies have shown that exposures to chemicals pose potential health risks which may vary from person to person.health advisories and a well-informed workforce make for happier and more productive employees.we offer support & information for parents who think their children's health might be suffering at school, and assistance to schools & childcare centres in the form of safe, workable, non toxic alternatives for cleaning, maintenance & pest control contracts.when cleaning products and air fresheners are used indoors, occupants are exposed to airborne chemicals, potentially leading to health risks.they can be extremely harmful to one already suffering respiratory distress.in addition to the damage caused by this soot to home furnishings and the ventilation system, there may also be a health hazard associated with breathing the sub-micron particulate soot, especially among the elderly, children, and those with compromised respiratory systems.science has now established that indoor air pollutants can be a major contributor to a person's overall exposure to air pollutants.these findings raise major concerns in view of documented evidence, dating back to 1985, that these phthalates induce birth defects, low sperm counts, and other reproductive toxicity in experimental animals.given that every mammogram, indeed every x-ray procedure, carries an increased risk of causing cancer, development of this safe, non-radiation technique should be a priority.products safer for human users also are safer for the environment and can replace more-toxic products.many common household cleaners contain toxic solvents, fragrances, disinfectants, and other ingredients that can pollute the air and cause respiratory, skin, and other reactions.in addition, the findings from these studies indicate that the same air pollutants subject to regulation under the clean air act are often found at much higher levels indoors.all community members and workers have the right to organise with other local communities and workers for the purpose of seeking to ensure a working environment free from hazard.given that every mammogram, indeed every x-ray procedure, carries an increased risk of causing cancer, development of this safe, non-radiation technique should be a priority. ...
