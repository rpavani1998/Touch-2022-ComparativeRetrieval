the average cost of a natural gas  pipeline is one million dollars per mile, and we have 200,000 miles of natural  gas pipeline, which we can’t re-use because they are composed of metal  that would become brittle and leak, as well as the incorrect diameter to  maximize hydrogen throughput.
after 620 miles, 8 percent of the hydrogen has been used to move it through the  pipeline.31 conclusion at some point along the chain of making, putting energy in, storing, and  delivering the hydrogen, we will have used more energy than we can get back,  and this doesn’t count the energy used to make fuel cells, storage tanks,  delivery systems, and vehicles.32 when fusion can make cheap hydrogen, when  reliable long-lasting nanotube fuel cells exist, and when light-weight  leak-proof carbon-fiber polymer-lined storage tanks and pipelines can be made  inexpensively, then we can consider building the hydrogen economy  infrastructure.

a plausible 2% increase in the absorbed sunlight on a switch grass plantation could negate the climatic cooling benefit of the ethanol produced on it.
every processing step takes energy.
stover needs to be stored with a moisture content  of 15% or less, but it’s typically 35-50%, and rain or snow during  harvest will raise these levels even higher (doe feedstock roadmap).

other factors besides aging that could cause a disaster are  natural disasters, failure of the electric grid, increased and more severe  flooding, drought, and weather from climate change, lack of staffing as older  workers retire and there are few educated engineers available to replace them  — let alone build new power plants, and as terrorism and war increase  from global shortages of just about everything.
but many states along the west coast don’t have shallow shelves where windmills can be built — california’s best wind, by far, is offshore, but the water is far too deep for windmills, and the best wind is in the northern part of the state, too far away to be connected to the grid.

topsoil loss — causes, effects, and implications: a global perspective.
although there is a wide range of opinion about the amount of  residue that can be harvested safely without causing erosion, loss of soil  nutrition, and soil structure, many farmers will want to be on the safe side,  and stick with the studies showing that 20% (nelson, 2002) to 30% (mcaloon et  al., 2000; sheehan, 2003) at most can be harvested, not the 75% agribusiness  claims is possible.

jobs.  since part of what’s driving the ethanol  insanity is job creation, divert the subsidies and pork barrel money to erosion  control and sustainable agriculture.
oil was like that in the beginning: one barrel of oil energy was required  to get 100 more out, an energy returned on energy invested of 100:1.
changes to major ocean currents such as the gulf stream could affect areas well beyond the continental united states, affecting the climate of north america as well as other continents (michel).
will the united states need a second geologic repository?
due to high corn prices, continuous  corn (corn crop after corn crop) is increasing, rather than rotation of  nitrogen fixing (fertilizer) and erosion control sod crops with corn.

also, byproduct is a subset of what animals  eat.
5)  bioreactors that are efficient in the lab can’t be scaled up  to an industrial level 6)  doe cut the algae fuel research a long time ago it was so  unpromising 7)
the idea was interesting – atomic jets could  fly for months without refueling.
2) we’ve already dammed up the best rivers.

turbine tower buckling has been observed in typhoons, but no offshore wind turbines have yet been built in the united states.
corn and soy crops have higher erosion rates than most crops .
the major operating cost of hydrogen pipelines is compressor power and maintenance.30 compressors in the pipeline keep the gas moving, using hydrogen energy to push the gas forward.
that renders it  useless — the crop residue is buried in mud and decomposing rapidly.
impurities like acids, phenols, alkalis, and salts inhibit fermentation and can poison chemical catalysts.
if you liquefy it, you will be able to get more hydrogen energy into a smaller container, but you will lose 30–40 percent of the energy in the process.
fifty one million tons of  residue could make about 3.8 billion gallons of ethanol, less than 1% of our  energy needs.
