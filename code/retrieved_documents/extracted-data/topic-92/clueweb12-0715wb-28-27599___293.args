the clc again stated that it did not have enough information to adequately comment on the proposal.
the department wishes to make it clear that the exemption contained in sec. 570.62(b)(1) (new) that permits 16- and 17-year-olds to operate certain lightweight, small capacity, portable counter-top power-driven food mixers would not apply when the equipment is adapted--through the use of various attachments--to perform functions other than mixing, or to process meat or poultry products because of the prohibitions of ho 10 (occupations in the operation of power-driven meat-processing machines and occupations involving slaughtering, meat and poultry packing, processing, or rendering) (see sec.
although none of these injuries were life threatening, most were considered to be serious and many caused the partial loss of digits and will leave some permanent scarring.
consistent with its enforcement position, the department exercised its prosecutorial discretion, as authorized by 29 u.s.c. 216(e), and declined to cite reg. 3 occupations violations for the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds by state and local governments as long as that employment fell within the occupations authorized by reg. 3 (sec. 570.34(a) (old)) and did not involve any of the tasks or occupations prohibited by reg. 3 (sec.
the interpretations of the secretary of labor contained in subpart g indicate the construction of the law that guides the secretary in administrating and enforcing the act.
before a 14- or 15-year-old may legally perform work covered by the flsa, the act requires that the work itself be exempt, or that the secretary of labor has determined that the work to be performed does not constitute oppressive child labor.
the exception to this rule is where there is some discrete operation or division that could legitimately be characterized as such an establishment and therefore would be subject to these rules (e.g., minors employed in a food service operation at a city park or a publicly owned sports stadium).
(m)(1) employment inside and outside of places of business where machinery is used to process wood products.
accordingly, the title has been revised as follows: occupations involved in the operation of balers, compactors, and paper-products machines (order 12).
the department appreciates the concerns of both the ywn and the clc that the proposed work-study program, unlike the wecep, does not prohibit participating employers from displacing a worker already employed in the employer's establishment with a student (see sec. 570.36(e) (new)).
not only is the operation of such power-driven machinery prohibited by sec. 570.33(b) (old) and sec. 570.33(e) (new), the laundering of clothes and other materials generally constitutes a ``processing occupation'' which is prohibited under sec. 570.33(a) (old and new).
such youth may not ride in the bed of a pick-up truck, on the running board of a van, or on the bumper of a refuse truck.
``for example, 14- and 15-year-olds would be permitted to work on a pottery wheel, but would be prohibited from applying certain glazes and would be prohibited from any work on or around the high heats of a pottery kiln.
this section, however, does not prohibit the employment of 14- and 15- year-olds whose duties require them to occasionally enter freezers only momentarily to retrieve items as permitted by sec. 570.34(i).
finally, the report recommends that the apprenticeship and student- learner exemption contained in ho 10 be restricted to apply only to 16- and 17-year-olds employed in retail, wholesale, and service industries.
the department believes that implementation of the final rule would not reduce the overall number of safe, positive, and legal employment opportunities available to young workers.
youth 14 and 15 years of age may, however, operate office equipment pursuant to sec. 570.34(a) and vacuum cleaners and floor waxers pursuant to sec. 570.34(h).
as previously noted, the compactor and baler act provides that any new standard(s) adopted by ansi would also be sufficient for the determination of the safety of the scrap paper balers and paper box compactors, if the secretary of labor certifies the new standard(s) to be at least as protective of the safety of minors as the two standards specified in the act.
this is because historically such facilities, when open to the general public, have been considered to have a retail concept.
most recently, the department investigated the death of a 16-year-old grocery store worker in new york who was crushed to death by a baler that had been jerry-rigged to operate while the door to the loading chamber was open.
it is also important to note that all the prohibited occupations detailed in sec.
places of business where machinery is used to process wood products shall mean such permanent workplaces as sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, cooperage stock mills, furniture and cabinet making shops, gazebo and shed making shops, toy manufacturing shops, and pallet shops.
in addition, for purposes of this section, an employer's conduct shall be deemed knowing, among other situations, if the employer received advice from a responsible official of the wage and hour division to the effect that the conduct in question is not lawful.
because these jobs are not specifically permitted by sec.
the rule does not have ``substantial direct effects on one or more indian tribes, on the relationship between the federal government and indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the federal government and indian tribes.''
the on-off switch of the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor must be maintained in an off position when the machine is not in operation.
minors 14- and 15-years of age would still be prohibited from operating or assisting in the operation of such mixers under the provisions of reg. 3 (see sec. 570.33(e) (new)).
however, as the report implies, the use of chain saws by 16- and 17-year-olds would not be prohibited when cutting other materials such as metal, concrete, stone, and ice.
finally, the department does not accept nada's recommendation to expand sec. 570.34(a)(8) (old) to include all motor vehicles.
the department has decided to add abrasive cutting discs to the list of machines prohibited by ho 14 because it would be in keeping with the niosh recommendation and will provide important protections to working youth.
the report shows that a substantial number of deaths and injuries are associated with operating and assisting in tasks performed by power-driven hoisting apparatus, including deaths of youth (see niosh report, page 36).
it should also be noted that section 13(d) of the flsa already provides an exemption from the act's minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions to any homeworker engaged in the making of wreaths composed principally of natural holly, pine, cedar, or other evergreens (including the harvesting of the evergreens or other forest products used in making such wreaths).
(3) work in the repair or maintenance of roads, railroads or flumes and work in construction and maintenance of telephone lines, but only if the minors are not engaged in the operation of power-driven machinery, the handling or use of explosives, the felling or bucking of timber, the collecting or transporting of logs, or work on trestles.
for example, a minor may ride in a motor vehicle to reach another work site where he or she will perform work, to receive special training or instructions while riding, or to meet other employees or customers of the employer.
section 13(c)(7) defines a new entrant into the workforce as an individual who is under the age of 18 and at least the age of 14, and, by statute or judicial order, is exempt from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade.
places of business where machinery is used to process wood products shall mean such permanent workplaces as sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, cooperage stock mills, furniture and cabinet making shops, gazebo and shed making shops, toy manufacturing shops, and pallet shops.
in addition, the teacher-coordinator, the employer and the student would be required to sign a written participation agreement that details the objectives of the work-study program, describes the specific job duties to be performed by the student, and the number of hours and times of day that the student would be employed each week.
transportation incidents were the most common fatal event among forestry workers, accounting for 43 of the 82 deaths (see niosh report, page 30).
as used in this paragraph (l): permitted lifeguard duties include the rescuing of swimmers in danger of drowning, the monitoring of activities at poolside to prevent accidents, the teaching of water safety, and providing assistance to patrons.
these standards are also available for inspection at the occupational safety and health administration's docket office, room n-2625, u.s. department of labor, 200 constitution avenue, nw., washington, dc 20210, or any of its regional offices.
570.35a already includes provisions that allow the whd [[page 28427]] to grant requests for special variances from the occupation standards regarding prohibited work, and that this should be expanded to grant variances from the reg. 3 hours standards as well.
570.59, the section heading is revised to read as follows: sec. 570.59 occupations involved in the operation of power-driven metal forming, punching, and shearing machines (order 8).
the median number of days away from work for workers who suffered food slicer related injuries or illnesses was four days, not an insignificant number (see niosh report, page 47).
it does not include a workroom or workplace solely where meats are smoked.
the flsa would require that students participating in the work-study program, if covered by the act and not exempt from the minimum wage requirements of section 6, receive the applicable minimum wage for all hours worked.
the department also believes that the clc recommendations that the ratio of supervisors to young workers should be one-to-one and that all adults supervising have experience in the workplace or the industry were not contemplated by congress and would be viewed as excessive.
in fact, as discussed earlier, weed-eaters are among the equipment the department is adding as an example of power-driven machinery such youth are prohibited from operating (see sec. 570.33(e) (new)).
as with the blenders discussed above, their operation by minors under the age of 18 is prohibited under ho 10 when used to process meat.
the blending blades are attached, often permanently, to the bottom of the glass jar.
the department is incorporating the child labor civil money penalty provisions of the gina amendments into this final rule without prior notice and opportunity for public comment because it has for good cause found, pursuant to the administrative procedure act, 5 u.s.c. 553(b)(b), that these procedural requirements are unnecessary with respect to these particular regulatory changes.
examples of industries or activities included in sic 083 are the gathering of balsam needles, ginseng, huckleberry greens, maple sap, moss, spanish moss, sphagnum moss, teaberries, and tree seeds; the distillation of gum, turpentine, and rosin if carried on at the gum farm; and the extraction of pine gum.
examples of permitted machines and devices include, but are not limited to, dishwashers, toasters, dumbwaiters, popcorn poppers, milk shake blenders, coffee grinders, automatic coffee machines, devices used to maintain the temperature of prepared foods (such as warmers, steam tables, and heat lamps), and microwave ovens that are used only to warm prepared food and do not have the capacity to warm above 140 [deg]f. minors are permitted to clean kitchen equipment (not otherwise prohibited), remove oil or grease filters, pour oil or grease through filters, and move receptacles containing hot grease or hot oil, but only when the equipment, surfaces, containers and liquids do not exceed a temperature of 100 [deg]f. minors are also permitted to occasionally enter freezers momentarily to retrieve items in conjunction with restocking or food preparation.
students participating in a valid work-study program would be permitted to work up to eighteen hours a week, a portion of which may be during school hours, in accordance with the following formula that is based upon a continuous four-week cycle.
the department's administration of this enforcement position permitting the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds by state and local governments has had extremely positive results.
the ywn also suggested that the department should clearly state in the final rule that school is considered to be in session during any week in which school attendance is required for one or more days.
in addition, the department will not implement its proposal to reserve sec.
the department believes that despite the lack of comments, 16- and 17-year-olds can safely perform certain tasks within the timber tract, tree farm, and forestry service industries.
the employment would be permitted in any industry other than those prohibited by reg. 3 and would also be subject to all the applicable hours and times standards established in sec.
(5) employment of homeworkers engaged in the making of evergreen wreaths, including the harvesting of the evergreens or other forest products used in making such wreaths.
currently, the work of repairing, servicing, disassembling, and tending the machines covered by ho 7 is prohibited to 14- and 15-year-olds under reg. 3 at sec. 570.33(b) (old) and sec.

reg. 3, as currently written, does not allow 14- and 15-year-olds to participate in the network's work-study programs.
the sic industry group of timber tracts encompasses establishments primarily engaged in the operation of timber tracts or tree farms for the purpose of selling standing timber, including those establishments that grow christmas trees.
the chapter advised the department that the red cross had revised its own rules and had begun certifying 15-year-olds as lifeguards.
under the department's proposal, any employee under the age of 16 whose duties include this core duty--such as a ``junior lifeguard'' or a ``swim-teacher aide''-- or whose employment could place him or her in a situation where the employer would reasonably expect him or her to perform such rescue duties, would be performing the duties of a lifeguard while working in such a position.
the department received six comments on its enforcement position that defines the term school in session as applying to the normal hours of the public school system in the minor employee's district of residence.
during this process, congress solicited input from the department, niosh, employers, employer associations, and employee associations.
the wage and hour division has consulted with representatives of the department's occupational safety and health administration (osha) and will defer to that agency's expertise and guidance when determining whether an employer is in compliance with the safety provisions of this exemption--i.e., whether a workplace barrier is appropriate to the potential hazard, whether a sufficient distance has been maintained from machinery in operation, and whether the youth is exposed to excessive levels of noise and saw dust.
for example, sec. 570.34(a)(6) (old) prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in the operation of power-driven mowers or cutters and sec. 570.34(b)(6) (old) prohibits the employment of such minors in occupations that involve operating, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing power-driven food slicers, grinders, choppers, and cutters, and bakery-type mixers.
participating employers are also required to sign an agreement defining job duties and expectations.
the clc also argued that language in the proposed ho 4 is changed from the current rule and contradicts itself in that sec. 570.54(a) declares all occupations in logging to be particularly hazardous; that the definition of all occupations in logging contained in sec. 570.54(b) includes the constructing, repairing, and maintaining of camps used in connection with logging; and sec.
any student 14 or 15 years of age, enrolled in a college preparatory curriculum, whom authoritative personnel from the school attended by the youth identify as being able to benefit from the program shall be able to participate.
the clc stated that a child permanently expelled from public school might still be required, under state or local law or perhaps court order, to attend some other school.
in fact, employment opportunities for 14- and 15-year-olds would increase with creation, for example, of a limited exemption for certain work-study programs, allowing youth to be employed in work of an intellectual or creative nature, and allowing youth to be employed in those permitted occupations listed in sec.
the exemption would not apply to balers and compactors that are not designed or used to process paper or cardboard as such equipment may not be considered scrap paper balers or paper box compactors as required by the compactor and baler act.
accordingly, as suggested by those commenters, the department will define the term week as used in reg. 3 to be the same workweek the employer establishes for the youth to determine overtime compensation under 29 cfr 778.105--a fixed and regularly recurring period of 168 hours--seven consecutive 24-hour periods.
total reporting and recordkeeping burden hours: 1586.
though cognizant of the limitations of the report, the department places great value on the information and analysis provided by niosh.
the median number of days away from work for workers who suffered food slicer related injuries or illnesses was four days, not an insignificant number (see niosh report, page 47).
finally, the ywn's recommendation that the proposal be expanded to include specific items being stored in the freezer or cooler, such as seafood and poultry, is unnecessary because, as discussed above, sec.
those conditions included that the youth be trained and certified in aquatics and water safety by the red cross or by some similarly recognized certifying organization, and that the youth work under conditions acceptable to the red cross or some similarly recognized certifying organization.
they may work in the construction, operation, repair, or maintenance of living and administrative quarters of logging camps.
the department decided not to address, in the nprm, the niosh report recommendation to remove the ho 4 exemption that permits 16- and 17-year-olds to work in the construction of living and administrative quarters of logging camps.
the department's review of these new standards, which included input from niosh, concluded that the 2008 ansi standards are also as protective as those cited in the compactor and baler act.
this subpart authorizes only the following occupations in which the employment of minors 14 and 15 years of age is permitted when performed for periods and under conditions authorized by sec.
in addition, the following exceptions do not apply to work which entails entering the sawmill building, except for those minors whose employment meets the requirements of the limited exemptions discussed in sec.
as per the provisions of sec. 570.61(a)(4), it would not matter if products other than meat--such as vegetables or cheese--were being processed.
the department once again notes that it has requested public comment on the issue of exemptions for student-learners and apprentices in the anprm that was published in conjunction with, and on the same day as, the nprm.
crews often work from late afternoon to late at night as that is when most of the potential customers are likely to be at home.
in addition, when drafting the proposal regarding youth riding as passive passengers in motor vehicles, the department looked for guidance for establishing the criteria regarding the use of seat belts or other safety restraining devices.
sec. 570.58 occupations involved in the operation of power-driven hoisting apparatus (order 7).
operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines includes operating such machines, including supervising or controlling the operation of such machines, feeding material into such machines, helping the operator feed material into such machines, unloading materials from such machines, and helping the operator unload materials from such machines.
such minors may perform work in offices or repair or maintenance shops.
the department believes that the standards established by osha to address such potential exposures, which are continually under agency review, provide vigorous protections to all workers.
(b) occupations that the secretary of labor may, pursuant to section 3(l) of the fair labor standards act, find and declare to be hazardous for the employment of minors between 16 and 18 years of age or detrimental to their health or well-being.
during the remaining week of the four-week cycle, such minor would be permitted to work during school hours on no more than two days, and for no more than eight hours on each of those two days.

the agreement, which must also be signed or otherwise consented to by the student's parent or guardian, would also affirm that the student will receive the minimum number of hours of class room instruction as required by the state educational agency for the completion of a fully-accredited college preparatory curriculum and that the employment will comply with the applicable child labor and minimum wage provisions of the flsa.
the afl-cio, ywn, and clc also noted that this proposal would allow [[page 28415]] youth to perform janitorial and clean-up work, work already permitted within retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments by sec. 570.34(a)(6) (old), in additional types of establishments.
in these situations, the department has determined that it is not necessary for every employer (tenant) that wishes to take advantage of the loading exemption to post a notice on
such training is available to 15-year-olds via a separate red cross water safety instructor (wsi) course.
to clarify that the limited exemption to ho 11 which permits 16- and 17-year-olds to operate certain lightweight, small capacity, portable counter-top power-driven food mixers (see sec. 570.62(b)(1)) would not apply when the equipment is adapted--through the use of various attachments--to perform functions other than mixing, or to process meat or poultry products because of the prohibitions of ho 10.
the occupation of lifeguard is not specifically authorized in reg. 3 as an occupation that 14- and 15-year-olds may perform.
the department then multiplied this rate, which includes fringe benefits, by 52.5 hours.
every youth shall receive, every school year he or she participates in the work-study program, at least the minimum number of hours of classroom instruction, as required by the state educational agency responsible for establishing such standards, to complete a fully-accredited college preparatory curriculum.
other forestry workers gather products which requires them to climb trees *
finally, the department does not accept nada's recommendation to expand sec.
in certain situations, such as at shopping malls, industrial parks, office buildings, or military bases, multiple employers may have access to and use ``community'' balers and compactors that the facilities manager or owner has made available to the tenants or contractors.
home-schooled youth would be able to participate in work-study programs operated by local public schools in the same manner many currently participate in team sports programs, band, and other extracurricular activities.
the clc commented that the department's proposal that the supervision received by young workers employed under the provisions of flsa section 13(c)(7) be close, direct, constant, and uninterrupted is essential in view of the serious hazards that such youth will face.
included on the list of prohibited power-driven meat processing machines are meat patty forming machines, meat and bone cutting saws, meat slicers, knives (except bacon-slicing machines), headsplitters, and guillotine cutters; snoutpullers and jawpullers; skinning machines; horizontal rotary washing machines; casing-cleaning machines such as crushing, stripping, and finishing machines; grinding, mixing, chopping, and hashing machines; and presses (except belly- rolling machines).

such work would include, for example, delivering items to a customer or assisting passengers with the loading and unloading of their luggage in conjunction with the operation of an airport shuttle van.
the report also documents that the forestry industry has a high fatality rate as well, and workers face injury risks similar to those of logging workers.
the academic schedules of the students are carefully coordinated so that students do not miss any classes on the days they work and the school year has been extended beyond the standard academic schedule of the local public school to compensate for the time the students spend at work.
they create steam at a temperature that ``clearly exceeds the temperature limits established for prohibiting use of other equipment such as anything related to hot oil that exceeds a temperature of 100 degrees f.'' a representative of the billings, montana job service also questioned how the department's proposal addresses the employment of youth who operate espresso machines.
570.34(a) (old) and all the prohibited occupations contained in sec. 570.34(b) (old) that currently apply only to retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments.
in proposing these regulations, the department will help agencies meet their needs to hire certified lifeguards by allowing lifeguards to begin work at the age of 15.
the implementation of revised subpart g of the child labor regulations, general statements of interpretation of the child labor provisions of the fair labor standards act of 1938, as amended, to incorporate all the changes made by the agency since this subpart was last revised in 1971, will simply provide compliance guidance on the child labor provisions detailed in earlier subparts of 570 and therefore imposes no economic costs.

the report contends that such manlifts appear to pose more significant injury risk than those traditionally prohibited by ho 7 (see niosh report, page 36).
the department associates no additional costs for the workplace observation requirement to ensure compliance with the flsa child labor provisions, because such monitoring will normally be conducted when school staff visit the workplace to see whether educational objectives are being met.
most of these blenders were free standing counter-top models while others were incorporated into other equipment such as milk dispensers.
v. executive order 12866; regulatory flexibility this final rule is being treated as a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of e.o. 12866 because of its importance to the public and the department's priorities.
accordingly, as suggested by those commenters, the department will define the term week as used in reg. 3 to be the same workweek the employer establishes for the youth to determine overtime compensation under 29 cfr 778.105--a fixed and regularly recurring period of 168 hours--seven consecutive 24-hour periods.
in three of the four weeks, the participant is permitted to work during school hours on only one day per week, and for no more than for eight hours on that day.
except for civil penalties collected for violations of section 212 of the flsa, sums collected as penalties pursuant to section 216(e) of the flsa shall be applied toward reimbursement of the costs of determining the violations and assessing and collecting such penalties, in accordance with the provision of section 202 of the act entitled ``an act to authorize the department of labor to make special statistical studies upon payment of the cost thereof and for other purposes'' (29 u.s.c. 9a).
finally, the department appreciates the concerns of both the ywn and clc that under the guise of ``artistic or creative endeavors'' some employers have attempted to employ youth in unsafe or unsavory lines of work that, as the commenters note, jeopardize the morals of the young workers.
in addition, flsa section 16(e) states that any person who violates the provisions of flsa sections 12 or 13(c), relating to child labor, or any regulations issued under those sections, shall be subject to a civil penalty, not to exceed: (1) $11,000, for each employee who was the subject of such a violation; or (2) $50,000 with regard to each such violation that causes the death or serious injury of any employee under the age of 18 years, which penalty may be doubled where the violation is repeated or willful.

570.32 (new) that all work that is not specifically permitted is prohibited.
there is little occupational injury, illness, and fatality data available regarding minors less than 16 years of age.
furthermore, section 13(c)(7) permits the employment of a new entrant inside or outside places of business where machinery is used to process wood products only if the youth is protected from wood particles or other flying debris within the workplace by a barrier appropriate to the potential hazard of such wood particles or flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient distance from machinery in operation, and is required to use personal protective equipment to prevent exposure to excessive levels of noise and saw dust.
accordingly, the dol estimates wsp sponsor school districts will incur an average of $1440 (rounded) in additional compliance costs.
the department is also adding to that section its long-standing position that outside school hours means such periods as before and after school hours, holidays, summer vacations, weekends, and any other day or part of a day when the local public school district where the minor resides while employed is not in session.
the department has interpreted the reg. 3 prohibition regarding service as helpers on a motor vehicle to preclude youth under the age of 16 from riding anywhere outside the passenger compartment of the motor vehicle.
the other provisions of sec. 570.35 (limiting employment to no more than 8 hours a day on any one day school is not in session, and no more than 40 hours in any one week when school is not in session) remain applicable to the employment of wecep participants.
the department also believes that the clc recommendations that the ratio of supervisors to young workers should be one-to-one and that all adults supervising have experience in the workplace or the industry were not contemplated by congress and would be viewed as excessive.
the clc assumed that the youth-employer's establishment ``means inside or directly outside the establishment, but not away from the establishment, such as on a street corner or parking lot.
the clc commented that ``[if] the school day schedules established by private schools and by parents of home-schooled children could determine when children being educated in those settings governed here, there would be nothing in the dol child labor regulations that would prevent such a school or parent from setting a schedule that would permit children to work during the hours that the public school system is in session.
killing floor includes a workroom, workplace where such animals as cattle, calves, hogs, poultry, sheep, lambs, goats, buffalo, deer, or horses are immobilized, shackled, or killed, and the carcasses are dressed prior to chilling.
some permitted milk shake blenders had more than one spindle so multiple products could be processed simultaneously.
the report notes that investigations of baler-related incidents show that failure to maintain machinery in safe operating condition contributes to fatalities and serious injuries and that neither adult supervisors nor young workers may fully appreciate the risks posed by uncontrolled hazardous energy.
remanufacturing department shall mean those departments of a sawmill where lumber products such as boxes, lawn furniture, and the like are remanufactured from previously cut lumber.
there is, thus, no corresponding environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement.
the department also recognizes the concerns of the ywn and clc over the department's decision not to limit the student-learner and apprentice exemption contained in ho 10 at this time.
other forestry workers gather products which requires them to climb trees *
the final rule also provides that 16- and 17-year-olds may perform such fire prevention tasks as the clearing of fire trails or roads; the construction, maintenance, and patrolling of fire lines; the maintaining of fire fighting equipment;
pulling lumber from the dry chain, except minors under 16 years of age may not pull lumber from the dry chain as such youth are prohibited from operating or tending power-driven machinery by sec. 570.33(e) of this part.
the department has also moved the definition of portable sawmill contained within sec. 570.54(a)(2) (old) to the definitions section (sec. 570.54(b) (new)).
accordingly, the title has been revised as follows: occupations involved in the operation of balers, compactors, and paper-products machines (order 12).
the report notes that there were 712 non-fatal injuries and illnesses in 1997, with a median of 11 days away from work, associated with work with mixers, blenders, and whippers (see niosh report, page 49).
the department was able to quickly put an end to this unacceptable employment by not only enforcing the child labor and minimum wage provisions of the flsa, but by partnering with local law enforcement authorities to ensure that city and state laws addressing community standards were enforced.
the report also did not consider potential approaches for decreasing workplace injuries and fatalities that provide an alternative to a complete ban on employment, such as safety training, increased supervision, the use of effective personal protective equipment, and strict adherence to recognized safe working practices.
in addition, the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor must include an on-off switch incorporating a key-lock or other system and the control of the system must be maintained in the custody of employees who are at least 18 years of age.

regulatory revisions many of the revisions being made by this final rule will result in the redesignation of several sections and subsections of the regulations.
it also commented that the fact that dol would require the lifeguards to be certified by the red cross (or a similar certifying organization) in aquatics and water safety ``in no way assures that the dol proposal is prudent.''
for example, the department has developed long- standing enforcement positions regarding the application of certain of the hours standards limitations to minors who, for differing reasons, no [[page 28423]] longer attend or are unable to attend school.
it reported that about one-third of those injuries were to the eye.

in order to address the concerns of the red cross, ensure the maximum possible safety for young workers and their charges who are learning to swim, and eliminate confusion, the department is modifying the language in the proposed sec.
as an outgrowth of this proposal, it stated that ``it would make sense either for the wage and hour division to enforce osha in this context by issuing osha citations that assert osha violations, or for the wage and hour division investigator to notify osha of an osha violation and direct osha to investigate the matter as well for osha violations.
the ywn also noted that ``back hoes'' and ``front-end-loaders'' would fall within the definition of high-lift trucks and recommended, for the sake of clarity, that the department specifically name them in the revised sec. 570.58(b).

the department appreciates the concerns of the one employer and two employer associations that recommended that an employee's own academic schedule and individual attendance requirements should be used to determine when school is in session for that minor and recognizes how such a position could be seen as a means of providing minors with more work experiences while addressing employer staffing problems.
the employment of a 14- or 15-year-old who by statute or judicial order is exempt from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade inside or outside places of business where machinery is used to process wood products
the clc labeled as a ``wise approach'' the department's proposal to rely on the expertise of osha, or the office charged with administering an osha-authorized state plan where appropriate, to determine if employers are complying with certain of the safety standards established by flsa section 13(c)(7).
as used here, the terms youth peddling, door-to-door-sales, and street sales do not include legitimate fund-raising activities by eleemosynary organizations such as cookie sales conducted by the girl scouts of america or school fund-raising events where the [[page 28413]] students are truly volunteers and are not promised compensation for the sales they make.
ho 14 also prohibits such minors from setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning circular saws, band saws, and guillotine shears.
the ywn and the clc supported using the hours of the local public school district the minor would attend if he or she attended public school when defining the term school in session.
but when it is determined that an employer- employee relationship does exist, and the employee is engaged in work that is subject to the flsa, the minimum age for such employment at a traditional swimming pool would be 14.
therefore, the department requested in the nprm that the public provide information that would help it identify which occupations or tasks within the timber tract, tree farm, and forestry services industries are not particularly hazardous to youth.
however, when those jobs are not located in retail, food service, or gasoline service establishments, the provisions of sec. 570.34 (old) (both authorizations and prohibitions) do not apply to the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds.

(2) work of operating, tending, riding upon, working from, repairing, servicing, or disassembling a manlift or freight elevator, except 16- and 17-year-olds may ride upon a freight elevator operated by an assigned operator.
(iii) clean-up in the lumberyard.
young workers have been killed or seriously injured while operating wood chippers.
(iv) piling, handling, or shipping of cooperage stock in yards or storage sheds other than operating or assisting in the operation of power-driven equipment; except minors under 16 years of age may not perform shipping duties as they are prohibited from employment in occupations in connection with the transportation of property by rail, highway, air, water, pipeline, or other means by sec.
these youth are often transported by crew leaders in vans, which fail to meet proper safety and insurance requirements, to areas quite distant from their home neighborhoods.
the niosh report notes that the fatality rate for adolescents aged 16 and 17 was 5.1 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers for the 10-year period 1980-89
570.33 (new) would be applicable to the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds, regardless of the industries in which they are employed.
not included in the definition of a traditional swimming pool or a water amusement park would be such natural environment swimming facilities as rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs, wharfs, piers, canals, or oceanside beaches.
as a result, no tribal summary impact statement has been prepared.
(o) work in connection with riding inside passenger compartments of motor vehicles except as prohibited by sec. 570.33(f) or sec. 570.33(j), or when a significant reason for the minor being a passenger in the vehicle is for the purpose of performing work in connection with the transporting--or assisting in the transporting of--other persons or property.
likewise, a 14- or 15-year-old could be employed, with all the safeguards of sec.
the department does not share the ywn's concerns about adding ``a new and unique age cut-off for this one particular job, when all other regulations group 15-year- olds with 14-year-olds.''
the department also notes that 14- and 15-year-olds who are employed in artistic or creative endeavors will continue to be prohibited from performing any of the occupations or tasks detailed in the revised sec. 570.33.
the department recognizes niosh's extensive research efforts in compiling and reviewing this data.
such youth may work up to 23 hours in any one week when school is in session and not more than 3 hours in any day when school is in session, any portion of which may be during school hours.
the following tasks in forest fire prevention provided none of these tasks may be performed in conjunction with or in support of efforts to extinguish a forest fire: the clearing of fire trails or roads; the construction, maintenance, and patrolling of fire lines; the piling and burning of slash; the maintaining of fire fighting equipment; and acting as a fire lookout or fire patrolman.
reg. 3, originally promulgated in 1939, was revised to reflect the 1961 amendments to the flsa, which extended the act's coverage to include enterprises engaged in commerce or the production of goods for commerce and thereby brought more working youth employed in retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments within the protections of the act.
also in 2000, a municipality contacted the department inquiring whether it could legally employ such youth as lifeguards at its city-owned swimming pools.
furthermore, the employer must also post a notice on the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor that conveys certain information, including the identification of the applicable ansi standard that the equipment meets, that 16- and 17-year-old employees may only load the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor, and that no employee under the age of 18 may operate or unload the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor.
the department notes that when the compactor and baler act was enacted, congress took considerable pains to ensure that the legislation contained appropriate safeguards that would provide young workers with necessary protections while ensuring that the employers of such youth could achieve and maintain compliance.
youth peddling does not include the activities of persons who, as volunteers and without compensation, sell goods or services on behalf of eleemosynary organizations or public agencies.
the department also notes that reg. 3 has for many years prohibited young workers from operating compact power mixers or blenders, also know as ``immersible wands'' and ``immersion blenders,'' used for such tasks as liquefying soups and sauces and pureeing fruits, meats, and vegetables.
(2) this section shall not apply to the operation of pizza-dough rollers, a type of dough sheeter, that: have been constructed with safeguards contained in the basic design so as to prevent fingers, hands, or clothing from being caught in the in-running point of the rollers; have gears that are completely enclosed; and have microswitches that disengage the machinery if the backs or sides of the rollers are removed.
the department charged the employer of this youth with a violation of ho 5, and assessed and collected a civil money penalty because of the violation.
the usla further commented that this position was also reached by participants at a national conference held in 1980 which issued a report entitled ``guidelines for establishing open-water recreational beach standards.''
similarly, the department believes that the clc recommendation regarding the mandatory reporting of work-related injuries and deaths that might occur to youth employed under the provisions of flsa section 13(c)(7) would be duplicative of the reporting requirements already established by osha.
the blending blades are attached, often permanently, to the bottom of the glass jar.
the department also proposed to add buffalo and deer to the lists of animals contained in the definitions of the terms killing floor and slaughtering and meat packing establishments and to note that these lists are not exhaustive.
the department believes that the continuation and incorporation of this enforcement position brings clarity in that employers need only look to the hours of operation of the local public school where the minor resides to attain compliance.
the one private citizen comment, which concerned the issue of door-to-door sales, was incorrectly submitted to the anprm docket by the commenter and was assigned a document id of whd-2007-0001-0004.
the youth would have to be enrolled in a college preparatory curriculum and must receive, every year they participate in the work- study program, at least the minimum number of hours of class room instruction required by the applicable state educational agency responsible for establishing such standards.
all occupations in timber tracts means all work performed in or about establishments that cultivate, manage or sell standing timber.
in addition, the prohibitions against operating or tending power-driven equipment contained in sec. 570.33(b) (old) and sec. 570.33(e) (new) and the prohibition against employment in occupations in connection with the transportation of property contained in sec. 570.33(f)(1) (old) and sec.
the term shall not include work in forest nurseries, establishments primarily engaged in growing trees for purposes of reforestation.
the department now concurs that employment at such camps, which are purposely located considerable distances from forest fires, when in compliance with all other hazardous occupations orders, is not particularly hazardous or detrimental to the health or well-being of 16- and 17-year-olds.
reg. 3 limits the hours and times of day that such minors may work and identifies occupations that are either permitted or prohibited for such minors.
the department also understands that, given the constant development and changes occurring in the modern workplace, in continuing to provide a definitive list of permitted occupations and industries, it may unintentionally discourage the creation of positive and safe employment opportunities for young workers.
the department has long taken the position that ho 4 (logging occupations and occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage stock mill) prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from operating chain saws in logging operations because the ho prohibits all work ``in connection with the felling of timber.''
the department appreciates the concerns raised by the red cross that certified lifeguards may not have received the proper training, and therefore the proper certification, to give swimming instruction.
in order to clarify the final rule, the department has decided to add ponds and quarries to the non-exhaustive list of examples of natural environment swimming facilities that currently includes rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs, wharfs, piers, canals, and oceanside beaches.
an incomplete or inaccurate posting by the facilities manager or owner will not relieve an employer from being charged with a violation of ho 12 or assessed a child labor civil money penalty.
the department appreciates the concerns of the ywn and clc regarding the use of certain power-driven pizza dough rollers, but again notes that its enforcement experience indicates that when employers properly apply all the provisions of the enforcement position--which have been included in the proposed limited exemption-- 16- and 17-year-olds can safely operate such equipment.
[[page 28452]] or ordinance, or by court order, to attend another school.
participating youths are assigned to assist an instructor, are never left alone to teach a class, and also help during recreational swims ``by checking in/out patrons bags/apparel/ belongings.''
it is important to note that the clc is incorrect in its assumption that this proposal would permit the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds by messenger service firms that ``have standing contracts with law firms, accounting firms, and other types of businesses'' to deliver documents or small packages.
(c) cooking with electric or gas grills which does not involve cooking over an [[page 28450]] open flame (note: this provision does not authorize cooking with equipment such as rotisseries, broilers, pressurized equipment including fryolators, and cooking devices that operate at extremely high temperatures such as ``neico broilers'').
clc stated ``dol's osha experts are familiar with these hazards.''
band saws were also covered under ho 11 when used to cut sheet cakes to desired sizes and shapes.
* * these workers also cut the trees with a chainsaw and drag them from the cutting area to a truck and then load them on to a truck.
however, such tasks are permitted only when not performed in conjunction with extinguishing a forest fire.
the sic industry group of timber tracts encompasses establishments primarily engaged in the operation of timber tracts or tree farms for the purpose of selling standing timber, including those establishments that grow christmas trees.
while the department agrees with the clc that it is unlikely that many such schools or home-schooling programs would materialize, it does note that the emergence of schools that were designed to allow migrant children to work on farms during the daylight hours when the local public school was in session, was an impetus for the 1949 amendment to the flsa that codified this very same enforcement position as it relates to agricultural employment.
on the other hand, the department has adopted an enforcement position since at least 1981 that counter workers in quick service establishments or cashiers in grocery stores whose duties require them to occasionally enter freezers only momentarily to retrieve items are not considered to be working in the freezers.
specifically, the department believes school districts sponsoring a wsp will incur the greatest additional costs.
the department believes that by continuing to reference certain common prohibited machinery by name, both clarity and compliance will be increased.
the department believes congress was aware that such standards are copyright protected and available to the public only at a cost or for reviewing at an appropriate library.
the afl-cio, ywn, and clc also noted that this proposal would allow [[page 28415]] youth to perform janitorial and clean-up work, work already permitted within retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments by sec. 570.34(a)(6) (old), in additional types of establishments.
570.63(b) to mean a powered machine designed or used to compress materials other than paper or cardboard boxes, with or without binding, to a density or form that will support handling and transportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable container.
for example, the department has developed long- standing enforcement positions regarding the application of certain of the hours standards limitations to minors who, for differing reasons, no [[page 28423]] longer attend or are unable to attend school.
effects on families the undersigned hereby certifies that this rule will not adversely affect the well-being of families, as discussed under section 654 of the treasury and general government appropriations act, 1999.
these specialized metal balers and compactors, which process such items as cars, radiators, and siding, may share similar designs and operating procedures with those compactors and balers that process only paper products or process other materials in addition to paper products.
the network provided information that its model is achieving its stated aims.
the clc commented that ``dol's approach here hardly comports with its stated desire to balance `the benefits of employment opportunities with the necessary and appropriate safety protections' (72 fr 19337).
s245.5-1990, and that the new standard ansi z245.2-1997 is as protective of the safety of minors as standard ansi z245.2-1992.
in addition, these standards are available for inspection at the national archives and records administration (nara).
these accommodations ensure that students complete a fully accredited, college preparatory curriculum that exceeds both state and accrediting agency requirements.
the report observes that not all machines that perform cutting and sawing functions fit into ho 14's definitions of circular saw, band saw, or guillotine shears; for example, abrasive cutting disks do not have visible notches or teeth, but they perform the same function.
youth have been injured and have died as a result of these activities.
contrary to nada's statement, reg. 3, of which sec. 570.34(a)(8) is a part, has clearly stated in sec. 570.33(b) for many years that 14- and 15-year-olds may not be employed in ``occupations which involve the operation or tending of hoisting apparatus or of any power-driven machinery other than office machines'' (emphasis added).
the employer will be held responsible for any violations of the flsa or the child labor regulations.
this same issue was mentioned by pleasant hill, which noted that it had swimming instructors who were properly certified by the red cross but were not certified as lifeguards.
the report notes that baler and compactor related deaths are not limited to those in which paper or cardboard is being processed.
the department believes congress was aware that such standards are copyright protected and available to the public only at a cost or for reviewing at an appropriate library.
sec. 570.34(m) and 570.54(c): (i) straightening, marking, or tallying lumber on the dry chain or the dry drop sorter.
[[page 28460]] to a 30-mile radius of the minor's place of employment.
the department notes that the use of standard industrial codes by the niosh report was helpful in identifying the different occupations and industries that could be impacted by the department's ho.
the department would also note that, as mentioned by the clc, 14- and 15-year-olds have been permitted to be employed by hospitals and nursing homes for many years.
the department believes that the continuation and incorporation of this enforcement position brings clarity in that employers need only look to the hours of operation of the local public school where the minor resides to attain compliance.
although the greatest number of these injuries and illnesses occurred in meat packing [[page 28435]] plants (5,526), establishments that produce sausages and prepared meats experienced 4,147 injuries and illnesses, and poultry slaughtering and processing establishments experienced 3,937 that same year (see niosh report, page 43).
therefore, 15-year-olds working at the tops of waterslides are fulfilling one of the core duties of properly trained lifeguards, in a manner which places them at the least possible risk.''
570.37 (new) would indeed be the employer of the youth under the flsa and held to all the act's minimum wage, overtime, record keeping, and child labor provisions--unless subject to a specific exemption or exception--as would any other employer.
the administrator of the wage and hour division shall approve the application, or give prompt notice of any denial and the reasons therefor.
the department also believes that the certification process as proposed by the department, which again is similar to that required of wecep applicants, provides sufficient transparency without requiring publication in the federal register or public comment.
revisions to ho 12 to prohibit the employment of minors in the operation of balers and compactors not currently covered by the ho, and the expansion of ho 14 to add additional power-driven equipment to the list of equipment minors may not operate, are also the result of niosh report recommendations.
(iv) piling, handling, or shipping of cooperage stock in yards or storage sheds other than operating or assisting in the operation of power-driven equipment; except minors under 16 years of age may not perform shipping duties as they are prohibited from employment in occupations in connection with the transportation of property by rail, highway, air, water, pipeline, or other means by sec.
the child labor provisions of the fair labor standards act (flsa) establish a minimum age of 16 years for employment in nonagricultural occupations, but the secretary of labor is authorized to provide by regulation for 14- and 15-year-olds to work in suitable occupations other than manufacturing or mining, and during periods and under conditions that will not interfere with their schooling or health and well-being.
such employment is very similar to that involved with the operation of logging camps, occupations that 16- and 17-year-olds have been permitted to perform for many years.
by removing this subsection, the department removes the exception for timber tract and forestry service occupations.
[[page 28417]] such youngsters' moral health, even if not on their physical health and safety.''
the permitted blenders are identical to models used in private homes, generally do not operate at more than 600 watts, and have jar capacities that do not exceed 8 cups (64 ounces).
the department does not interpret the helper prohibition as applying to 14- and 15-year-olds who simply ride inside a motor vehicle as passengers and, thus, reg. 3 permits a 14- or 15-year-old, under certain circumstances, to ride inside the enclosed passenger compartment of a motor vehicle operated by a driver whose employment complies with the conditions specified in ho 2.
the department notes that it is not imposing any recordkeeping burdens on the employers or the school districts beyond those proposed in the 2007 nprm, therefore no additional estimates of costs or burdens will be incurred that [[page 28429]] must be accounted for pursuant to the paperwork reduction act and regulatory flexibility act.
similarly, witnesses stressed that early morning and late evening work hours, which interfered with sleep and often fostered exhaustion, were unhealthful for children and also diminished the time that children should have spent with the family (see in the matter of proposed regulation relating to the employment of minors between 14 and 16 years of age under the fair labor standards act, official report of the proceedings before the children's bureau, february 15, 1939, at 19, 21, 34, 82).
such light tools would include, but are not limited to, rakes, hand-held clippers, shovels, and brooms.
compactor that is designed or used to process materials other than paper means a powered machine that remains stationary during operation, designed or used to compact refuse other than paper or cardboard boxes into a detachable or integral container or into a transfer vehicle.
the report states that current injury and fatality surveillance systems do not provide sufficient detail to justify this exemption.
in order to address the concerns of the red cross, ensure the maximum possible safety for young workers and their charges who are learning to swim, and eliminate confusion, the department is modifying the language in the proposed sec.
[[page 28436]] report's recommendation to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to operate and feed power-driven meat and food slicers in retail, wholesale and service industry establishments.
the department's enforcement experience confirms that employers have many ways of ensuring that, should they wish to take advantage of the limited exception contained in flsa section 13(c)(5), their balers and compactors comply with the appropriate ansi standard.
the department believes that the youths who will be employed under the provisions of flsa section 13(c)(7) will receive significant workplace protections from the statute and these resulting regulations.
the youth does not operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines; (iii)
the department is evaluating the alternative recommendation made by the report that it consider developing a new ho that combines the sawing machinery covered under ho 14 with other specialized machinery that performs cutting and sawing functions through direct contact of the cutting surface and the material.
the report notes that in 1997 there were an estimated 13,646 occupational injuries and illnesses resulting in days away from work among employees in the meat products manufacturing industry.
* (e) an administrative determination of the amount of the civil money penalty for a particular violation or particular violations of section 12 or section 13(c) relating to child labor or any regulation issued under those sections shall become final 15 days after receipt of the notice of penalty by certified mail by the person so charged unless such person has, pursuant to sec.
(v) clerical work in yards or shipping sheds, such as done by ordermen, tally-men, and shipping clerks.
the department charged the employer of this youth with a violation of ho 5, and assessed and collected a civil money penalty because of the violation.
in addition, niosh also was able to identify 16 additional deaths of workers of all ages that were attributable to forest fire fighting activities (see niosh report, page 30).
the occupation of lifeguard is not specifically authorized in reg. 3 as an occupation that 14- and 15-year-olds may perform.
the prohibition would include the catching and cooping of all poultry, not just chickens.
each minor riding as a passenger in a motor vehicle must have his or her own seat in the passenger compartment; each seat must be equipped with a seat belt or similar restraining device; and the employer must instruct the minors that such belts or other devices must be used.
by adding skid loaders, skid-steer loaders, and bobcat loaders to the definition of high-lift trucks, the department believes it will clarify the requirements for compliance with ho 7.
570.103 comparison with wage and hour provisions.
under ho 7, 16- and 17-year-olds may currently perform such work, except they may not assist in the operation of a crane, derrick, or hoist as defined by the ho.
additionally, a considerable number of deaths were associated with activities not directly related to operation of the hoisting apparatus, notably servicing, repairing, and disassembling.
this subpart authorizes only the following occupations in which the employment of minors 14 and 15 years of age is permitted when performed for periods and under conditions authorized by sec.
establishments that perform timber estimation and valuation and forest fire prevention and pest control are also included in sic 085.
cfoi data reflect that during the period of 1994-2004, 15- year-olds experienced an occupational fatality rate of 4.7 fatalities per 100,000 workers--a rate that was greater than that experienced by all workers aged 15 and older.
the interpretations of the secretary of labor contained in subpart g indicate the construction of the law that guides the secretary in administrating and enforcing the act.
the department notes that when rules are clearly written and adequately explained, public understanding and compliance follow.
the department notes that when such programs do not involve an employer-employee relationship, they fall outside the provisions of the flsa.
in order to clarify the final rule, the department has decided to add ponds and quarries to the non-exhaustive list of examples of natural environment swimming facilities that currently includes rivers, streams, lakes, reservoirs, wharfs, piers, canals, and oceanside beaches.
the report also documents that the forestry industry has a high fatality rate as well, and workers face injury risks similar to those of logging workers.
no student shall participate in the work-study program until there has been made a written agreement signed by the teacher-coordinator, the employer, and the student.
(old and new), permitting 16- and 17-year-olds to be employed in certain sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage stock mill occupations.
as niosh stated, ``[t]his relatively small difference in rates is cause for concern because youth under age 18 are employed less frequently in especially hazardous jobs.''
reg. 3, as currently written, does not allow 14- and 15-year-olds to participate in the network's work-study programs.
whd and osha, as recommended by the clc, will continue their partnership to leverage the education and outreach efforts and enforcement actions of each agency.
that penalty may be doubled, up to $100,000, when such violation is determined by the department to be a repeated or willful violation.
it would also include work on tree farms, except those tree farm establishments that meet the definition of agriculture contained in 29 u.s.c. 203(f).
the secretary, in promulgating this final rule, hereby certifies that standard ansi z245.2-2004 and standard ansi z245.2-2008 are as protective of the safety of minors as standard ansi z245.2-1992 and that standard ansi z245.5-2004 and standard ansi z245.5-2008 are as protective of the safety of minors as standard ansi z245.5-1990.
even though reg. 3 for many years has prohibited the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds to operate any power-driven equipment other than office machines, the department routinely receives inquiries as to the status of these individual pieces of equipment under reg. 3.
it felt that the proposal was so narrowly tailored to one specific program that it could easily bar other school systems ``that have similar, but not identical, approaches'' from taking advantage of the program.
that final rule limited permitted cooking duties to cooking (1) with electric or gas grills which does not involve an open flame (see sec. 570.34(b)(5)(i) (old) and sec. 570.34(c) (new)), and (2) cooking with deep fryers that are equipped with and utilize a device which automatically lowers the baskets into the hot oil or grease and automatically raises the baskets from the hot oil or grease (see sec. 570.34(b)(5)(ii) (old) and sec. 570.34(c)
in addition, this enforcement position applies only to the operation of the machine.
one such condition is that the equipment must meet specific standards issued for balers or for compactors by the american national standard institute (ansi).
in addition, sec. 570.33(a) (old and new) provides additional protections as it prevents the employment of such youth in work places where goods are manufactured, mined, or otherwise processed.
we note, as reported by the clc, that osha, which is the recognized expert in occupational safety and health issues, already has in place important safety standards addressing emergency release mechanisms, panic bars, and unobstructed paths in the workplace--and that these standards protect all workers, not just those under the age of 16.
at such a hearing, the employer or an attorney retained by the employer may present such witnesses, introduce such evidence and establish such facts as the employer believes will support the exception.
the ho prohibits, with certain exceptions discussed below, the loading, operating, and unloading of scrap paper balers, including paper box balers and compacting machines, and other power-driven machines used in the remanufacture or conversion of paper or pulp into a finished product.
the department's enforcement experience includes situations where employers have questioned why 16- and 17-year-olds were not permitted to use small mixers to process such things as cheese dip and batter for seafood when such machines generally appeared to present no risks to such minors.
finally, the ywn's recommendation that the proposal be expanded to include specific items being stored in the freezer or cooler, such as seafood and poultry, is unnecessary because, as discussed above, sec.
no employer or employer association, when commenting on the 1999 or the 2007 nprm, reported that it was difficult or expensive to determine that their balers and/or compactors met or failed to meet the appropriate ansi standards.
the department's review of standard ansi z245.2-2004 has found it to be as protective of the safety of minors as standard ansi z245.2- 1992, and the department's review of standard ansi z245.5-2004 has found it be as protective of the safety of minors as standard ansi z245.5-1990.
in addition, for purposes of this section, an employer's conduct shall be deemed knowing, among other situations, if the employer received advice from a responsible official of the wage and hour division to the effect that the conduct in question is not lawful.
the employment would be permitted in any industry other than those prohibited by reg. 3 and would also be subject to all the applicable hours and times standards established in sec.
* * had the 14th highest lifetime risk of 5.8 deaths per 1,000 workers'' (see niosh report, page 28).
section 570.55 lists, when discussing the prohibited occupations involved in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines, such activities as supervising or controlling the operation of the machines, feeding materials into such machines, and helping the operator feed material into such machines.
over the last ten years, the department has investigated the serious injuries of several youth that resulted from the use of chain saws to cut branches and trees, charged violations under ho 5, and assessed and collected civil money penalties because of those violations.
the journal noted that the victim had been drinking beer while trimming the branches.
such training is available to 15-year-olds via a separate red cross water safety instructor (wsi) course.
the department wishes to emphasize that the development of this student-work program was never intended to advantage any single, private school system, but was proposed for the benefit of all academically motivated students enrolled in college preparatory curricula that can avail themselves of such a program of employment that clearly facilitates, rather than interferes with, their schooling.
finally, the clc noted the department's statement that youth peddlers performing outside sales are usually exempt from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the flsa and took issue with the department's failure to ban peddling by 16- and 17-year-olds as well.
the american journal of forensic medicine and pathology (volume 28, no. 4, december 2001) reports on the death of a 32-year-old male who lost his balance and fell on the blade of an electric reciprocating saw he was using to trim branches.
the youth is protected from wood particles or other flying debris within the workplace by a barrier appropriate
as with the blenders discussed above, their operation by minors under the age of 18 is prohibited under ho 10 when used to process meat.
written participation agreement: the school system administering the wsp and each applicable employer shall separately maintain a copy of the written participation agreement for each student.
it serves the best interests of the 14- and 15-year- old parent, as well as the young parent's child, for the parent to complete his or her education, thus realizing a long-term benefit of increased and better employment in the future.''
the department has long taken the position that ho 4 (logging occupations and occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage stock mill) prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from operating chain saws in logging operations because the ho prohibits all work ``in connection with the felling of timber.''
information collection burdens total number of respondents: 1530 (30 school districts and 1500 employers).
under this final rule, properly certified 15-year-olds could be employed at such pools as lifeguards.
(a) the administrative determination of the amount of the civil penalty for each employee who was the subject of a violation of section 12 or section 13(c) of the act relating to child labor or of any regulation under those sections will be based on the available evidence of the violation or violations and will take into consideration the size of the business of the person charged and the gravity of the violations as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
this exemption, as detailed in the compactor and baler act, would apply only to certain scrap paper balers and paper box compactors, as currently defined in sec. 570.63(b).
the department appreciates and understands the commenters' concerns about the potential occupational exposure of young workers to hazardous and toxic chemicals or to bloodborne pathogens.
the clc commented that ``[w]orking in the forestry industry can involve working at heights *
hoist-related fatalities of young workers have been reported, including a recent case in which a youth was killed while operating a half-ton capacity hoist'' (see niosh report, page 36).
for example, sec. 570.34(a)(6) (old) prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in the operation of power-driven mowers or cutters and sec. 570.34(b)(6) (old) prohibits the employment of such minors in occupations that involve operating, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing power-driven food slicers, grinders, choppers, and cutters, and bakery-type mixers.
in early 2005, the department, after reviewing additional information, extended this enforcement position to permit the employment of 15-year-olds as lifeguards at all traditional swimming pools regardless of who owns, operates or manages the establishments, and at those facilities of water amusement parks that constitute traditional swimming pools.
the kind of work performed in such departments is similar to that done in planing mill departments in that rough lumber is surfaced or made into other finished products.
youth have been injured and have died as a result of these activities.
e. logging occupations and occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage stock mill (order 4) (29 cfr 570.54) ho 4 generally prohibits minors 16 and 17 years of age from being employed in most occupations in logging and in the operation of a sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill or cooperage stock mill.
in addition, when serving as dispatchers or attendants at the top of an elevated water slide, minors under 16 years of age are not performing, nor can they reasonably be expected to perform, the core lifeguard duty of rescuing swimmers because they are so far removed from the splash- down area of the slide.
the machine was the only baler at the center and, therefore, was used to process a wide variety of items.
accordingly, the department proposed to amend the definition of power- driven woodworking machines to include those machines that process trees, logs, and lumber.
unlike the machines currently listed in sec. 570.65(a)(1), the prohibition would not be lifted if the chain saws, wood chippers, or reciprocating saws were equipped with full automatic feed and ejection-devices--devices that are almost never found on such equipment.
these specific conditions, which are contained in ho 2 (sec. 570.52), include that the automobile or truck may not exceed 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, the driving must be restricted to daylight hours, the vehicle must be equipped with a seat belt or similar restraining device for the driver and for any passengers, and the employer must instruct the employee that such belts or other devices must be used.
such light non-power- driven hand tools would include, but are not limited to, rakes, hand- held clippers, shovels, and brooms, but would not include items like lawn mowers or other power-driven lawn maintenance equipment.
employers of wsp participants are also required to keep a copy of the written participation agreement for each student employed.
the clc again stated that it did not have enough information to adequately comment on the proposal.
the department also understands that, given the constant development and changes occurring in the modern workplace, in continuing to provide a definitive list of permitted occupations and industries, it may unintentionally discourage the creation of positive and safe employment opportunities for young workers.
c. periods and conditions of employment (29 cfr 570.35) flsa section 3(l) authorizes the secretary of labor to provide by regulation for the employment of young workers 14 and 15 years of age in suitable nonagricultural occupations and during periods and under conditions that will not interfere with their schooling or with their health and well-being.
the employer must also post a notice on the machine that states, among other things, which applicable ansi standard the machine meets.
in its document 5108, weed trimmers can throw objects and injure eyes, the u.s. consumer product safety commission estimated that, in 1989, there were approximately 4,600 injuries associated with power lawn trimmers or edgers that required emergency room treatment.
reports showing that minors were being injured when operating these machines on materials not covered by an existing ho led the department to issue the all- encompassing ho 14.
administrative law judge means a person appointed as provided in 5 u.s.c. 3105 and subpart b of part 930 of title 5 of the cfr, and qualified to preside at hearings under 5 u.s.c. 554-557.
it includes work on tree farms, except those tree farm establishments that meet the definition of agriculture contained in 29 u.s.c. 203(f).
if employers have allowed flsa covered and nonexempt 14- and 15-year-olds to wash or polish cars and trucks using power- driven washers or hand-tool buffers, they have done so in violation of the federal child labor provisions.
under reg. 3, 14- and 15-year-olds may work in certain occupations in retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments, but are not permitted to work in certain other occupations (including all occupations found by the secretary to be particularly hazardous for 16- and 17-year-olds).
the work-study program was implemented to help students offset the costs of a quality college preparatory education and develop important work experience and socialization skills that will allow them to assume leadership roles as adults.
the clc stated that ``most distressing is the fact that dol gives no indication of what the red cross training requires.''
(g) errand and delivery work by foot, bicycle, and public transportation.
for example, the occupational safety and health act of 1970 directed the department of labor to adopt the then-existing ansi standards, rather than delay any activity until the agency promulgated particular occupational safety and health standards (see section 6(a) of the occupational safety and health act, 29 u.s.c. 655(a)).
the costs imposed by this rule should not be significant for any single entity, and they do not affect a substantial number of small entities in a way that would require an analysis under the regulatory flexibility act.
(n) occupations in connection with: (1) transportation of persons or property by rail, highway, air, water, pipeline, or other means; (2) warehousing and storage; (3) communications and public utilities; (4) construction (including demolition and repair); except such office work (including ticket office) or sales work in connection with paragraphs (n)(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this section, as does not involve the performance of any duties on trains, motor vehicles, aircraft, vessels, or other media of transportation or at the actual site of construction operations.
the current sec. 570.65(a)(2) would be redesignated as sec. 570.65(a)(3) and revised to reflect that 16- and 17-year-olds could not be employed in occupations involving the setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning of any of the equipment covered by the ho.
the cup was then positioned on the machine so that the single spindle--with an aeration disk or disks mounted at the bottom--could blend the milk shake.
all occupations in logging shall mean all work performed in connection with the felling of timber; the bucking or converting of timber into logs, poles, piles, ties, bolts, pulpwood, chemical wood, excelsior wood, cordwood, fence posts, or similar products; the collecting, skidding, yarding, loading, transporting and unloading of such products in connection with logging; the constructing, repairing and maintaining of roads, railroads, flumes, or camps used in connection with logging; the moving, installing, rigging, and maintenance of machinery or equipment used in logging; and other work performed in connection with logging.
this provision is designed to prevent such youth from being injured by contact with the machines' sharp blades and cutting surfaces.
finally, the department is adding a statement to sec.
included on the list of prohibited power-driven meat processing machines are meat patty forming machines, meat and bone cutting saws, meat slicers, knives (except bacon-slicing machines), headsplitters, and guillotine cutters; snoutpullers and jawpullers; skinning machines; horizontal rotary washing machines; casing-cleaning machines such as crushing, stripping, and finishing machines; grinding, mixing, chopping, and hashing machines; and presses (except belly- rolling machines).
the final rule also included the secretary's certification, as permitted by the compactor and baler act, that the new standard ansi z245.5-1997 is as protective of the safety of minors as standard ansi-
15- year-olds are permitted to operate them under the provisions of reg. 3.
the council noted that frequently ``the academic schedule and attendance requirements followed by public schools do differ, sometimes significantly, from the schedule followed by private schools.
fifteen-year-olds employed as lifeguards would, however, be prohibited from entering or working in any mechanical rooms or chemical storage areas, including any areas where the filtration and chlorinating systems are housed.
the prohibition against such youth setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning any of the machines currently listed in ho 12 would be extended to include compactors and balers that are designed to process materials other than paper.
in addition, the clc noted that such minors would be permitted to work up to eight hours a day and up to forty hours a week at computers, typing or inputting data, during non-school weeks.
in addition to changing the title of ho 4 to accommodate this revision, the department has also added definitions of the terms all occupations in forestry services and all occupations in timber tracts to sec. 570.54(b).
(6) employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to load, but not operate or unload, certain scrap paper balers and paper box compactors under specified conditions.
in fact, ensuring that permissible job opportunities for working youth are safe, healthy, and not detrimental to their education, as required by the statute, produces many positive benefits in addition to fewer occupational injuries and deaths, including reduced health and productivity costs that employers may otherwise incur because of higher accident and injury rates to young and inexperienced workers.
the department appreciates the concerns of the fmi and the council, but must reiterate that the number and severity of occupational injuries suffered by youth who operate or clean power-driven meat
the regulatory changes that implement these statutory changes do no more than conform the previously-existing regulations to the recent statutory amendments and do not impose any economic costs on employers that are required to comply with the provisions of sections 12 and 13(c) of the flsa.
employers that avail themselves of the provisions of the loading exemption contained in flsa section 13(c)(5) and rely on the accuracy of notices posted by others cannot delegate their compliance obligations imposed by that exemption.
even if nada had presented data supporting its statement that power-equipment-assisted motor vehicle washing and polishing poses ``no significant safety or health risks to 14- and 15-year-olds,'' the department notes that such a standard is considerably more lax than the flsa section 3(l) standard the secretary must apply when determining permissible employment opportunities for such youth.
the risks associated with poultry catching also occur in the catching and cooping of poultry other than chickens--for example, processors of turkeys and cornish game hens employ similar methods of moving their products to slaughter.
the following operations when they do not involve the removal of materials or refuse directly from a saw table or point of operation: the carrying, moving, or transporting of materials from one machine to another or from one part of a plant to another; the piling, stacking, or arranging of materials for feeding into a machine by another person; and the sorting, tying, bundling, or loading of materials.
the department believes that these additional requirements, many of which correspond to the criteria established for operating a wecep under sec. 570.36 (new), will provide adequate protections to all students who participate in an approved work-study program under the provisions of sec.
with this type of machine, an attendant wheels the cart to the dumpster, empties the cart into the dumpster, and then wheels the cart back to the compactor where it is reattached.
the department agrees with the recommendations of both the ywn and clc that the regulatory text be revised to specifically state that 14- and 15-year-olds may not be employed as sign-wavers, promoting particular products, services, or events, except when performing the sign waving activities directly in front of an establishment providing the product, service or event.
while a 14- or 15-year old may be a passive passenger in a vehicle, that same minor is not permitted to ride in a motor vehicle when a significant reason for the minor being a passenger is for the purpose of performing work in connection with the transporting--or assisting in the transporting--of other persons or property.
the clc commented that the department's proposal that the supervision received by young workers employed under the provisions of flsa section 13(c)(7) be close, direct, constant, and uninterrupted is essential in view of the serious hazards that such youth will face.
the department, when issuing the 2004 final rule, noted that there still remained one class of balers and compactors that falls outside of the scope of ho 12--those machines that are designed or used exclusively to process materials other than paper.
the use of such equipment would also be prohibited by ho 10 when the mixer or wand is equipped with knives, blades, or cutting tools designed for use on meat and poultry.
the department appreciates the ywn's recommendation that ho 10 should be expanded to cover seafood processing occupations, but notes that no data was submitted regarding the level of youth employment in that industry or the injury rates experienced by that industry.
the employment of minors under 14 years of age is not permissible under any circumstances if the employment is covered by the child labor provisions and not specifically exempt.
the occasional processing of paper or a cardboard box by a machine designed to process other materials would not bring the loading of such machines within the limited exemption provided by section 13(c)(5).
flsa section 13(d) provides an exemption from the child labor provisions, as well as the minimum wage and overtime provisions, for homeworkers engaged in the making of wreaths composed principally of natural holly, pine, cedar, or other evergreens (including the harvesting of the evergreens or other forest products used in making such wreaths).
the department is aware that, given the flsa's mandate that before 14- or 15-year-olds may legally be employed to perform any covered work, the secretary of labor must first determine that the work to be performed does not constitute oppressive child labor, it could choose to publish only a list of permissible occupations and industries, and not provide a list of certain commonly arising prohibited occupations and industries.
the prohibition would not depend on the material or materials being processed and would encompass the occupations of setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning such machines.
the niosh report recommendations are driven by information on high-risk activities for all workers, not just patterns of fatalities and serious injuries among young workers.
the red cross, just like other nationally recognized certifying organizations, spends a great deal of time and effort formulating, refining, disseminating, and publicizing the elements and standards of its lifeguard certification program.
the department will carry on these efforts and will continue to work with both niosh and osha to better educate employers, employees, and enforcement personnel about the requirements of the ansi standards.
16- and 17-year-olds from employment in most timber tract and forestry service occupations.
[[page 28412]] inventory and cleanup work, involving prolonged stays in freezers or meat coolers, are also prohibited.
an analysis of the time it will take to prepare the application and written training agreements for a wsp and the associated recordkeeping suggests these educational institutions will each spend an average of about 52.5 hours more to comply with this final rule than might otherwise be spent to establish a similar work- study program.
the occupation of lifeguard, as used in this subpart, entails the duties of rescuing swimmers in danger of drowning, the monitoring of activities at a swimming pool to prevent accidents, the teaching of water safety, and assisting patrons.
the employment of such minors would still be subject to the time of day and number of hours standards contained in sec.
this is because the report also recommended the creation of a new ho that would prohibit all work in construction occupations which, if adopted, would impact the provisions of not only ho 4 but several other hos.
but the department believes that, by continuing its past practice of carefully reviewing inquiries regarding individual occupations or industries not currently addressed by reg. 3 and then exercising its prosecutorial discretion and issuing enforcement positions that may eventually lead to rulemaking--as evidenced by certain revisions contained in this final rule--it has developed an efficient and effective mechanism which overcomes the limitations of a definitive list.
the department has over the years documented reports of minors, many as young as 10 or 11 years of age, working as part of mobile sales crews, selling such items as candy, calendars, and greeting cards for profit-making companies.
this commenter stated that through door-to-door sales ``many kids learn how to be confident and build communication skills with adults.''
rendering plants means establishments engaged in the conversion of dead animals, animal offal, animal fats, scrap meats, blood, and bones into stock feeds, tallow, inedible greases, fertilizer ingredients, and similar products.
all occupations in timber tracts means all work performed in or about establishments that cultivate, manage or sell standing timber.
in administering the flsa, the department does not consider such individuals, who volunteer or donate their services, usually on a part-time basis, for public service, religious, or humanitarian objectives, without contemplation of pay, to be employees of the religious, charitable, or similar nonprofit corporations that receive their services.
in that regard, the department is nearing completion of its thorough review of the niosh recommendations that address the agricultural hazardous occupations orders.
school systems, employers, and the department will use these records to document the validity of the wsp and that the 14- and 15-year-old students were employed in accordance with the special wsp rules.
this includes such equipment as the two- or four- slice ``pop-up'' toasters similar to those manufactured for home use and the conveyor-type bread toaster now often found at self-service breakfast buffets.
the employment of students participating in the work-study program would also most likely be subject to state wage requirements and child labor provisions.
during the remaining week of the four-week cycle, such minor is permitted to work during school hours on no more than two days, and for no more than for eight hours on each of those two days.
gina, among other things, amended flsa section 16(e) so that any person who violates the provisions of sections 12 or 13(c) of the flsa, relating to child labor, or any regulation issued pursuant to such sections, shall be subject to a civil money penalty not to exceed $11,000 for each employee who was the subject of such a violation.
additional ancillary lifeguard duties may include checking in and out such items as towels, rings, watches and apparel.
570.63 that would prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from performing the occupations of operating or assisting to operate any baler or compactor that is designed or used to process materials other than paper.
jobs in such areas as state and local governments, banks, insurance companies, advertising agencies, and information technology firms all normally fall outside of the permitted establishments declared in reg. 3.
the current ho 10 exemption permitting the killing and processing of rabbits or small game in areas physically separated from the killing floor would not be changed.
in the 2004 final rule, the secretary certified that standard ansi z245.5-1997 is as protective of the safety of minors as standard ansi-s245.5-1990 and that standard ansi z245.2-1997 is as protective of the safety of minors as standard ansi z245.2-1992.
570.34(l) to permit the employment of 15-year-olds as lifeguards at swimming pools and water amusement parks under certain conditions.
570.127 homeworkers engaged in the making of evergreen wreaths.
the information provided, which also echoed the department's enforcement experiences, indicated that such factors as bowl capacity, the horsepower of the motor, the portability of the machine (light weight and not permanently wired or ``hardwired'' into the establishment's electrical power source), and similarity to equipment designed exclusively for home use were all important criteria.
for example, a minor may ride in a motor vehicle to reach another work site where he or she will perform work, to receive special training or instructions while riding, or to meet other employees or customers of the employer.
the department has also long taken the position that ho 5 prohibits the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to operate wood chippers to grind tree limbs, branches, and trunks into chips, mulch, or debris.
under the department's proposal, any employee under the age of 16 whose duties include this core duty--such as a ``junior lifeguard'' or a ``swim-teacher aide''-- or whose employment could place him or her in a situation where the employer would reasonably expect him or her to perform such rescue duties, would be performing the duties of a lifeguard while working in such a position.
the red cross recommended that the department [[page 28419]] alleviate possible public misunderstanding by deleting ``giving swimming instructions'' from the list of permitted lifeguard duties.
the ho also prevents such minors from performing all occupations involved in the operation or feeding of several power-driven meat processing machines when performed in slaughtering and meat packing establishments, as well as in wholesale, retail, or service establishments.
570.35b would preclude anyone but a student enrolled in a college preparatory curriculum from participating in any work-study program in the future.
the department has learned of occupational injuries to workers operating reciprocating saws to cut materials other than wood.
the usla commented that, since 1980, it has maintained the position that lifeguards serving at natural environments, whether surf or non-surf beaches, should be at least 16 years of age.
the result was, as discussed earlier, that the compactor and baler act required that before 16- and 17-year-olds could load such equipment, the scrap paper baler had to meet standard ansi z245.5-1990 and the paper box compactor had to meet standard ansi z245.2-1992.
reports showing that minors were being injured when operating these machines on materials not covered by an existing ho led the department to issue the all- encompassing ho 14.
students participating in a valid work-study program would be permitted to work up to eighteen hours a week, a portion of which may be during school hours, in accordance with the following formula that is based upon a continuous four-week cycle.
the report notes that the survey of occupational injuries and illnesses reports that in 1997, food and beverage processing machinery were responsible for 11,737 nonfatal injuries and illness that resulted in days away from work.
in three of the four weeks, the participant would be permitted to work during school hours on only one day per week, and for no more than eight hours on that day.
finally, the department has determined that the final rule provides sufficient clarity that it is not necessary to adopt the clc's recommended revision to the opening sentence of sec. 570.33 to repeat the statement contained in sec. 570.32 (``employment that is not specifically permitted is prohibited.'').
in addition, the department will not implement its proposal to reserve sec. sec. 570.131 through 570.139, again at the direction of the federal register.
finally, the department notes that the clc takes exception to the department not taking any action on the niosh report recommendation regarding the limited exemption contained in ho 12 for student-learners and apprentices.
(l) catching and cooping of poultry in preparation for transport or for market.
such youth would not be permitted to perform any of the core functions of a lifeguard nor be employed in a situation where their employers could reasonably expect them to rescue swimmers in danger of drowning.
but because greater clarity and protections can be realized, the department will add atvs to the list of named equipment.
the department agrees with the ywn that the word intellectual better comports with the intent of this proposal than the word mental.
information collection burdens total number of respondents: 1530 (30 school districts and 1500 employers).
for purposes of the assessment of civil money penalties under 29 cfr part 579, an employer's violation of section 12 or section 13(c) of the act relating to child labor or any regulation issued pursuant to such sections shall be deemed to be willful where the employer knew that its conduct was prohibited by the act or showed reckless disregard for the requirements of the act.
the department does not share the ywn's concerns about adding ``a new and unique age cut-off for this one particular job, when all other regulations group 15-year- olds with 14-year-olds.''
since subpart g was last revised, not only have several hos been amended, but the process for promulgating and revising the hos has also changed.
the department appreciates the time and effort all of these commenters devoted to their submissions.
the department does not accept the dolwd's recommendation that reg. 3 be revised to permit 14- and 15-year-olds to operate certain weed- eaters because of the potential for injury associated with the operation of such equipment.
the written agreement shall be signed by the teacher-coordinator, the employer, and the student.
over the last ten years, the department has investigated the serious injuries of several youth that resulted from the use of chain saws to cut branches and trees, charged violations under ho 5, and assessed and collected civil money penalties because of those violations.
the rationale for this recommendation is that although injury fatality rates in meat products manufacturing industries are relatively low, rates of disorders due to repeated trauma are extremely high.
the department proposed to amend the definition of power-driven woodworking machines to include those machines that process trees, logs, and lumber in recognition that section 13(c)(7) now permits certain youth 14 through 17 years of age to work in such places of business as sawmills, lath mills, and shingle mills where trees, logs, and lumber would be processed.
they stated that such employment includes the potential for exposure to hazardous and toxic chemicals or to bloodborne pathogens, particularly in medical and dental offices, hospitals and nursing homes, and when youth accept employment with professional janitorial services.
finally, a representative of the coosa valley regional development center requested that 14- and 15-year-olds be permitted to be employed in painting activities because the ``paint products in use today do not contain lead or other hazardous materials.''

in an attempt to acquire additional data needed to address the remaining nonagricultural niosh recommendations and to pursue certain other issues not explored in the niosh report, the department also published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (anprm) concurrently with the 2007 nprm (see 72 fr 19328).
although none of these injuries were life threatening, most were considered to be serious and many caused the partial loss of digits and will leave some permanent scarring.
inside or outside places of business shall mean the actual physical location of the establishment employing the youth, including the buildings and surrounding land necessary to the business operations of that establishment.
the clc objected to the department's proposal, stating that it did not have sufficient information on the underlying rationale for the proposed change to adequately comment on it.
expanding the eligible age for employment as a lifeguard at traditional swimming pools could help these communities enhance pool safety by providing a wider and larger applicant pool from which to select qualified candidates, and by increasing lifeguard availability, make shorter shifts an increasingly real probability.''
the term shall not include work in forest nurseries, establishments primarily engaged in growing trees for purposes of reforestation.
for purposes of the assessment of civil money penalties under 29 cfr part 579, an employer's violation of section 12 or section 13(c) of the act relating to child labor or any regulation issued pursuant to such sections shall be deemed to be willful where the employer knew that its conduct was prohibited by the act or showed reckless disregard for the requirements of the act.
570.35 to reflect that school would not be considered to be in session for a 14- or 15-year-old minor who has graduated from high school; or has been excused from compulsory school attendance by the state or other jurisdiction once he or she has completed the eighth grade and his or her employment complies with all the requirements of the state school attendance law; or has a child to support and appropriate state officers, pursuant to state law, have waived school attendance requirements for this minor; or is subject to an order of a state or federal court prohibiting him or her from attending school; or has been permanently expelled from the local public school

in order to eliminate confusion and provide clarity, the department has added a statement to sec. 570.33(j) noting that the ban on youth peddling does not prohibit a young salesperson from conducting sales for his or her employer on property controlled by the employer that is out of doors but may still properly be considered part of the employer's establishment.
570.103 comparison with wage and hour provisions.
paper box compactor means a powered machine that remains stationary during operation, used to compact refuse, including paper boxes, into a detachable or integral container or into a transfer vehicle.
(3) work in the repair or maintenance of roads, railroads or flumes and work in construction and maintenance of telephone lines, but only if the minors are not engaged in the operation of power-driven machinery, the handling or use of explosives, the felling or bucking of timber, the collecting or transporting of logs, or work on trestles.
the exemption also places limitations on the number of trips the 17-year-old may make each day and restricts the driving
570.131 through 570.139 to accommodate any additional statutory amendments to the flsa child labor provisions that may be enacted.
the superintendent of the public or private school system supervising and administering the work-study program shall file with the administrator of the wage and hour division a letter of application for approval of the work-study program as one not interfering with schooling or with the health and well-being of the minors involved and therefore not constituting oppressive child labor.
the city specifically requested permission to allow such minors to load and unload, onto and from motor vehicles, the light, non-power-driven tools each youth would personally use as part of his or her employment.
students, their parents, and the work-study director sign an agreement defining performance expectations and program support structures.
for the reasons discussed in this preamble, the department has similarly concluded and certified to the sba office of advocacy chief counsel that this final rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities in a manner that would require a final regulatory flexibility analysis.
finally, as mentioned above, such youth should also be permitted to perform certain tasks related to forest fire fighting and [[page 28432]] forest fire prevention, when not performed in conjunction with the extinguishing of a fire, such as the clearing of trails or roads; the construction, maintenance, and patrolling of fire lines; acting as a fire lookout or fire patrolman; and tasks associated with the operation of a fire fighting base camp.
finally, as noted above, reg. 3 limits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds to periods that are outside of school hours and to designated hours depending upon whether or not school is in session.
section 13(c)(7) defines a new entrant into the workforce as an individual who is under the age of 18 and at least the age of 14, and, by statute or judicial order, is exempt from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade.
absent any specific data on compensation of the persons who will actually perform the work to ensure [[page 28448]] compliance, the dol has estimated hourly costs this rule will impose on wsp sponsor schools by increasing the october 2009 average annual hourly rate for production or nonsupervisory workers on educational and health services payrolls of $19.59 by 40 percent to account for the value of fringe benefits (see the employment situation: december 2009, dol, bureau of labor statistics, january 2010, table b-3,http:// www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/empsit_01082010.pdf).
the kind of work performed in such departments is similar to that done in planing mill departments in that rough lumber is surfaced or made into other finished products.
except, this exception shall not apply when the mixer is used, with or without attachments, to process meat or poultry products as prohibited by sec. 570.61(a)(4).
570.36 (new)) would provide those programs with limited exemptions from the hours standards contained in sec. 570.35(a) that are similar to the exemptions provided by the proposed work-study program.
in addition, each driver transporting the young workers must hold a state driver's license valid for the type of driving involved and, if the driver is under the age of 18, his or her employment must comply with the provisions of sec. 570.52.
the report notes that baler and compactor related deaths are not limited to those in which paper or cardboard is being processed.
the list of prohibited industries and occupations helps to define and to provide clarity to the list of permitted industries and occupations.
the department believes that despite the lack of comments, 16- and 17-year-olds can safely perform certain tasks within the timber tract, tree farm, and forestry service industries.
acting as a fire lookout or fire patrolman; and the piling and burning of slash.
circular saw shall mean a machine equipped with a thin steel disc having a continuous series of notches or teeth on the periphery, mounted on shafting, and used for sawing materials.
the department believes that all these additional safety requirements, when coupled with the provisions of the revised sec. 570.33(i), adequately protect young workers who momentarily enter freezers.
570.127 homeworkers engaged in the making of evergreen wreaths.
under the network's model, four students share a single, full-time clerical position with a private employer at a work place screened and selected by the school.
x. executive order 13045, protection of children e.o. 13045, dated april 23, 1997 (62 fr 19885), applies to any rule that (1) is determined to be ``economically significant'' as defined in e.o. 12866, and (2) concerns an environmental health or safety risk that the promulgating agency has reason to believe may have a disproportionate effect on children.
no comments were received that identified any tasks in these industries as being safe for minors to perform.
[[page 28458]] abrasive cutting disc shall mean a machine equipped with a disc embedded with abrasive materials used for cutting materials.
examples of permitted machines and devices include, but are not limited to, dishwashers, toasters, dumbwaiters, popcorn poppers, milk shake blenders, coffee grinders, automatic coffee machines, devices used to maintain the temperature of prepared foods (such as warmers, steam tables, and heat lamps), and microwave ovens that are used only to warm prepared food and do not have the capacity to warm above 140 [deg]f. minors are permitted to clean kitchen equipment (not otherwise prohibited), remove oil or grease filters, pour oil or grease through filters, and move receptacles containing hot grease or hot oil, but only when the equipment, surfaces, containers and liquids do not exceed a temperature of 100 [deg]f. minors are also permitted to occasionally enter freezers momentarily to retrieve items in conjunction with restocking or food preparation.
for example, the department investigated the death of a 15-year-old male in 1999 who was employed as a poultry catcher, working in the dark and under red lighting, in arkansas.
the secretary, in order to provide clarity and assist employers in attaining compliance, has listed in sec.
additional ancillary lifeguard duties may include checking in and out such items as towels, rings, watches and apparel.
the department wishes to make it clear that the exemption contained in sec. 570.62(b)(1) (new) that permits 16- and 17-year-olds to operate certain lightweight, small capacity, portable counter-top power-driven food mixers would not apply when the equipment is adapted--through the use of various attachments--to perform functions other than mixing, or to process meat or poultry products because of the prohibitions of ho 10 (occupations in the operation of power-driven meat-processing machines and occupations involving slaughtering, meat and poultry packing, processing, or rendering) (see sec.
the department, however, does not agree that such an expansion of positive youth opportunities is improper or in any way fails to comport with the requirements and spirit of flsa section 3(l).
many machines are adaptable for the baling and compacting of a wide variety of materials, including paper, aluminum cans, plastic milk jugs, and general refuse.
for example, a ``mixer'' as discussed in sec. 570.62(b)(1) would become a ``grinder'' prohibited by ho 10 (see sec. 570.61(a)(4)) when the grinding attachment is in use.
the clc labeled as a ``wise approach'' the department's proposal to rely on the expertise of osha, or the office charged with administering an osha-authorized state plan where appropriate, to determine if employers are complying with certain of the safety standards established by flsa section 13(c)(7).
as used in this section: boning occupations means the removal of bones from meat cuts.
in some cases, this may result in a diminution of the risk by including less risky operations and industries in the employment estimates.
in addition, the department has, as early as 1991, interpreted the prohibition on cleaning such machines as precluding 16- and 17-year-olds from performing the hand or machine washing of parts of and attachments to power-driven meat processing machines, even when the machine was disassembled and reassembled by an adult.
these prohibitions would prevent a 14- or 15-year-old from working in a factory or workroom as a ``molder'' or ``hand painter'' producing mass quantities of nearly identical pottery or ceramic items, but when coupled with this final rule, they would permit the youth to express his or her artistic talents to shape by hand a unique clay pot or sculpt a piece of art.
in addition, although this rule impacts the child labor provisions of the flsa and the employment of adolescents and young adults, it does not impact the environmental health or safety risks of children.
an individual private school that was not part of a network, district, or system would also be able to apply to participate in a work study program.
it also expressed concerns that employers may have difficulty interpreting the ansi standards.
the department cannot enforce a minimum wage requirement for employees whom the congress has statutorily exempted from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the flsa.
such classroom instruction shall include, every year the youth participates in the work-study program, training in workplace safety and state and federal child labor provisions and rules.
16- and 17-year-olds from being employed in occupations involving the setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning of such pizza-dough rollers.
but when it is determined that an employer- employee relationship does exist, and the employee is engaged in work that is subject to the flsa, the minimum age for such employment at a traditional swimming pool would be 14.
the academic schedules of the students are carefully coordinated so that students do not miss any classes on the days they work and the school year has been extended beyond the standard academic schedule of the local public school to compensate for the time the students spend at work.
in addition, youth employed in timber tract, tree farm, and forestry service industries should be permitted to perform tasks related to forest marketing and forest economics that are not performed in a forest.
the council noted that frequently ``the academic schedule and attendance requirements followed by public schools do differ, sometimes significantly, from the schedule followed by private schools.
the department will add atvs to the list of prohibited equipment presented in the revised sec. 570.33(e) (new) as recommended by the afl-cio and clc.
the city was advised that this enforcement policy did not extend to other prohibited transportation-related work such as the loading or unloading of materials other than the light hand tools the minors may use on-the-job, such as trash or garbage, or power-driven equipment such as lawn mowers, edgers, and weed trimmers--the use of which by this age group is prohibited under reg. 3.
the list also includes the occupations of setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning the machines.
expanding the eligible age for employment as a lifeguard at traditional swimming pools could help these communities enhance pool safety by providing a wider and larger applicant pool from which to select qualified candidates, and by increasing lifeguard availability, make shorter shifts an increasingly real probability.''
the term places of business where machinery is used to process wood products shall mean such permanent workplaces as sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, cooperage stock mills, furniture and cabinet making shops, gazebo and shed making shops, toy manufacturing shops, and pallet shops.
for purposes of this exemption, a lightweight, small capacity mixer is one that is not hardwired into the establishment's power source, is equipped with a motor that operates at no more than \1/2\ horsepower, and is equipped with a bowl with a capacity of no more than five quarts.
the employment of such minors would still be subject to the time of day and number of hours standards contained in sec.
as used in this paragraph (m): inside or outside places of business shall mean the actual physical location of the establishment employing the youth, including the buildings and surrounding land necessary to the business operations of that establishment.
570.34(l) would not apply to the time spent as dispatchers or attendants at an elevated water slide.
the report notes that available data demonstrate that chainsaws specifically contributed to 70 worker deaths between 1992 and 1997 and over 1,600 lost workday injuries.
in addition to affirming the department's position that a skid loader was a ``high-lift truck'' within the meaning of ho 7, the court also found that the youths' operation of the equipment violated the ho even though the youth did not operate or utilize the loader's hoisting device but used the skid-steer loader as a ``scraper'' (see lynnville transport, inc. v. chao, 316 f. supp.
both niosh occupational injury data and the department's enforcement experience reflect that injuries occur when youth operate balers and compactors that are designed and used to process materials other than paper.
it also raises concerns that the ``host employer'' might not be subject to the same restrictions and requirements as any other employer who hires youth and that students may be replacing a ``regular paid employee.''
establishments that perform timber estimation and valuation and forest fire prevention and pest control are also included in sic 085.
570.62 its long-standing enforcement position regarding the operation of certain pizza-dough rollers by 16- and 17-year-old workers.
that penalty may be doubled, up to $100,000, when such violation is determined by the department to be a repeated or willful violation.
the department has also increased the dollar cost from $13 to $14 to account for increased postage costs since publication of the nprm.
this exception does not apply to the setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling or cleaning of such pizza-dough rollers.
as used in this section: crane shall mean a power-driven machine for lifting and lowering a load and moving it horizontally, in which the hoisting mechanism is an integral part of the machine.
a representative of six flags, inc. also supported the proposal and stated that ``[w]hile we still believe that 15-year-olds could safely work as dispatchers on elevated water elements, we find the proposed changes to be an acceptable compromise.''
the department also proposed to revise reg. 3 at sec. 570.34(o) (new) to permit 14- and 15-year-olds to ride in the enclosed passenger compartments of motor vehicles, except when a significant reason for the minors being passengers in the vehicle is for the purpose of performing work in connection with the transporting--or assisting in the transporting--of other persons or property.
permitted work of a mental nature would be limited to work that is similar to that performed in an office setting and not involving the use of any power-driven equipment other than office machines.
(e) price marking and tagging by hand or machine, assembling orders, packing, and shelving.
neither commenter provided any data or insight regarding how extensively atvs are used by youth in nonagricultural employment or whether the documented hazards resulted in occupational injuries.
such employment is very similar to that involved with the operation of logging camps, occupations that 16- and 17-year-olds have been permitted to perform for many years.
for purposes of this exemption, the department proposed that a lightweight, small capacity mixer is one that is not hardwired into the establishment's power source, is equipped with a motor that operates at no more than \1/2\ horsepower, and whose bowl capacity does not exceed five quarts.
these minors are frequently placed by employers, without adult supervision, at subway entrances, outside large office buildings, at high-traffic street corners, and on median strips at busy intersections where they can attract potential customers.
(e) occupations that involve operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing any power-driven machinery, including but not limited to lawn mowers, golf carts, all-terrain vehicles, trimmers, cutters, weed-eaters, edgers, food slicers, food grinders, food choppers, food processors, food cutters, and food mixers.
helper shall mean a person who assists in the operation of a machine covered by this section by helping place materials into or remove them from the machine.
the department will evaluate the information to determine if the program meets the requirements specified in the regulation, in order to respond to the request.
therefore 14- and 15- year-olds are permitted to operate them under the provisions of reg. 3.
first, the department has been persuaded by the comments of the forest service and the dolwd that 16- and 17-year-olds can safely be employed in certain capacities in forest protection and in the operation of fire fighting base camps.
one such condition is that the equipment must meet specific standards issued for balers or for compactors by the american national standard institute (ansi).
the clc supported this proposal but again expressed concern based on its erroneous assumption that such youth could be employed to paint automobiles.
finally, continuation of this enforcement position facilitates the enforcement of the reg. 3 hours standards by establishing a single, easily determinable standard.
recently, the department adopted an enforcement policy that it would not assert violations of ho 11 when 16- and 17-year-olds operate, assist to operate, setup, adjust, repair, oil, or clean certain small, lightweight, counter-top mixers.
in order to eliminate confusion and provide clarity, the department has added a statement to sec. 570.33(j) noting that the ban on youth peddling does not prohibit a young salesperson from conducting sales for his or her employer on property controlled by the employer that is out of doors but may still properly be considered part of the employer's establishment.
injuries, and even deaths, have occurred as the result of young children engaging in youth peddling activities.
when ho 12 was promulgated in 1954, the dangers specifically associated with the operation of scrap paper balers involved being caught in the plungers during the compression process and suffering strains and other injuries while moving the compressed bales.
such minors would be exempt from the ``when school is in session'' hours standards limitations contained in sec.
the department believes that these additional requirements, many of which correspond to the criteria established for operating a wecep under sec. 570.36 (new), will provide adequate protections to all students who participate in an approved work-study program under the provisions of sec.
school systems, employers, and the department will use these records to document the validity of the wsp and that the 14- and 15-year-old students were employed in accordance with the special wsp rules.
the department appreciates the concerns of the ywn, clc, and usla about lowering the employment age for lifeguards at traditional swimming pools and certain water amusement park facilities to 15, but believes that such safeguards as proper certification in aquatics and water safety by a recognized certification organization, the prohibition against tending power-driven machinery which prevents 15- year-olds from working as dispatchers or attendants at the top of elevated water slides, the osha standards addressing potential exposures to bloodborne pathogens and chemicals, and the hours and times of day standards established by sec.
the rationale for this recommendation is that although injury fatality rates in meat products manufacturing industries are relatively low, rates of disorders due to repeated trauma are extremely high.
during this process, congress solicited input from the department, niosh, employers, employer associations, and employee associations.
accordingly, the department is incorporating the provisions of the statutory amendments into the final rule without notice and comment.
the following occupations involved in the operation of power-driven hoisting apparatus are particularly hazardous for minors between 16 and 18 years of age: (1) work of operating, tending, riding upon, working from,
the department understands the concerns of both commenters as to the types of tasks young workers would be permitted to perform under the umbrella of ``artistic or creative endeavors'' and notes that it will rely on 29 cfr
the work-study program was implemented to help students offset the costs of a quality college preparatory education and develop important work experience and socialization skills that will allow them to assume leadership roles as adults.
the crew leaders, who often have ties to regional or national businesses, mistakenly claim that they and their young sales crews are independent contractors.
operating or assisting to operate means all work that involves starting or stopping a machine covered by this section, placing materials into or removing materials from a machine, including clearing a machine of jammed materials, paper, or cardboard, or any other work directly involved in operating the machine.
the fmi found it ``hard to understand why their work hours should be governed by a school system they have nothing to do with.''
all occupations in forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention, in timber tracts, in forestry services, logging, and the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage stock mill are particularly hazardous for the employment of minors between 16 and 18 years of age, except the following when not prohibited by any other section of this subpart: (1) work in offices or in repair or maintenance shops.
in addition, the student's parent or guardian shall either sign or otherwise provide consent for the participation agreement to be valid.
forestry workers also experienced fatal injuries such as those typically associated with the logging industry; in 26 of the 82 fatalities the worker was struck by a falling object (a tree in all but one instance).
similarly, a youth could be employed to create unique photographs that rise to the level of art, but would be prohibited from developing those photographs and working with the chemicals and solvents commonly used in such processing activities.
the department notes the clc's concerns that determining when school is in session by using each student's individual academic schedule could foster the development of nonpublic schools or home- schooling programs created primarily to provide 14- and 15-year-old working children to employers during the hours they would normally have attended public school.
e. logging occupations and occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage stock mill (order 4) (29 cfr 570.54) ho 4 generally prohibits minors 16 and 17 years of age from being employed in most occupations in logging and in the operation of a sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill or cooperage stock mill.
this new program does not in any way negate or preclude schools or employers from participating in other preexisting or future work-study programs, work experience and/or career exploration programs, internships, or apprenticeships that also comport with the provisions of the flsa (whether with the hours standards and time of day restrictions in sec.
the niosh report recommends that the department not only retain ho 4, but expand its coverage to include work in the operation of timber tracts (standard industrial classification (sic) 081) and forestry services (sic 085) because of the high number of fatalities occurring in such operations (see niosh report, page 27).
employees at these newly permitted work sites routinely use power-driven equipment that process materials that may not be included in the current definition of power-driven woodworking machines contained in ho 5, such as trees, logs, and lumber.
the niosh report did not mention the provisions of sec. 570.34(a)(8) because the report dealt exclusively with hos, which address work that is particularly hazardous or detrimental to the health and well-being of 16- and 17-year-old minors.
a traditional swimming pool, as used in this subpart, would mean a water-tight structure of concrete, masonry, or other approved materials located either indoors or outdoors, used for bathing or swimming and filled with a filtered and disinfected water supply, together with buildings, appurtenances and equipment used in connection therewith.
the clc ``welcomed'' the expansion of the prohibitions of ho 12 to include balers and compactors designed or used to process materials other than paper.
finally, the department appreciates the concerns of both the ywn and clc that under the guise of ``artistic or creative endeavors'' some employers have attempted to employ youth in unsafe or unsavory lines of work that, as the commenters note, jeopardize the morals of the young workers.
* (e) an administrative determination of the amount of the civil money penalty for a particular violation or particular violations of section 12 or section 13(c) relating to child labor or any regulation issued under those sections shall become final 15 days after receipt of the notice of penalty by certified mail by the person so charged unless such person has, pursuant to sec.
by applying each minor's actual school schedule, rather than arbitrarily applying the local public school schedule, job opportunities would be expanded for minors subject to child labor reg. 3 without adversely impacting the school work of such minors.''
it is also important to note that all the prohibited occupations detailed in sec. 570.33 (new) would be applicable to the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds, regardless of the industries in which they are employed.
fourteen- and 15-year-olds may conduct sales in such employer's exterior facilities, whether temporary or permanent, as garden centers, sidewalk sales, and parking lot sales, when they are employed by that establishment.
the department notes that the ywn's comment that the temperature reached by espresso makers ``exceeds the temperature limits [[page 28410]] established for prohibiting use of other equipment such as anything related to hot oil that exceeds a temperature of 100 degrees f'' does not comport with either the previous or revised provisions of reg. 3.
the department stated that, based on the comments it received, it would consider adding regulatory provisions to the final rule defining the terms school hours and school is in session as they apply to nonagricultural employment.
as the clc stated, ``dol's osha experts are familiar with these hazards.''
in addition, a school could apply and receive authorization under sec.
570.61 occupations in the operation of power-driven meat- processing machines and occupations involving slaughtering, meat and poultry packing, processing, or rendering (order 10).
this includes such equipment as the two- or four- slice ``pop-up'' toasters similar to those manufactured for home use and the conveyor-type bread toaster now often found at self-service breakfast buffets.
the network provided information that its model is achieving its stated aims.
a water amusement park means an establishment that not only encompasses the features of a traditional swimming pool, but may also include such additional attractions as wave pools; lazy rivers; specialized activities areas such as baby pools, water falls, and sprinklers; and elevated water slides.
but because many of the occupations and tasks addressed by the final rule either appear in more than one code or are not included in the codes listed in the report, the department did not use those codes in formulating the definitions used in the final rule.
this section shall not apply to the operation, including the setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling and cleaning, of lightweight, small capacity, portable counter-top power-driven food mixers that are, or are comparable to, models intended for household use.
finally, they may work in timber cruising, surveying, or logging engineering parties; in the repair or maintenance of roads, railroads, or flumes; and in forest protection, such as clearing fire trails or roads, piling and burning slash, maintaining fire-fighting equipment, constructing and maintaining telephone lines, or acting as fire lookouts or fire patrolman away from the actual logging operations--but only if such tasks do not involve the felling or bucking of timber, the collecting or transporting of logs, the operation of power-driven machinery, the handling or use of explosives, and working on trestles.
the participants attend 8 hours of training, which follows the red cross's guard start program, and then volunteer at the pool as aides during swim lessons.
every youth shall receive, every school year he or she participates in the work-study program, at least the minimum number of hours of classroom instruction, as required by the state educational agency responsible for establishing such standards, to complete a fully-accredited college preparatory curriculum.
(2) any person who repeatedly or willfully violates section 206 or 207 of the flsa, relating to wages, shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $1,100 for each such violation.
(b) occupations that the secretary of labor may, pursuant to section 3(l) of the fair labor standards act, find and declare to be hazardous for the employment of minors between 16 and 18 years of age or detrimental to their health or well-being.
fifteen-year-olds employed as lifeguards are, however, prohibited from entering or working in any mechanical room or chemical storage areas, including any areas where the filtration and chlorinating systems are housed.
c. periods and conditions of employment (29 cfr 570.35) flsa section 3(l) authorizes the secretary of labor to provide by regulation for the employment of young workers 14 and 15 years of age in suitable nonagricultural occupations and during periods and under conditions that will not interfere with their schooling or with their health and well-being.
the ywn assumed that the department's proposal would also ban the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds to perform sign waving, ``including holding or carrying of any type, posing or acting as a sign not directly in front of a retail establishment, or where no direct supervision exists'' (emphasis in original).
therefore, the prohibitions of ho 11 include the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to operate even the smallest of counter-top vertical mixers.
the transportation of the persons or property does not have to be the primary reason for the trip for this exception to apply.
circular saws and band saws were already covered under ho 5 when used on wood, ho 10 when used on meat, and ho 12 when used on paper products.
the report contends that such manlifts appear to pose more significant injury risk than those traditionally prohibited by ho 7 (see niosh report, page 36).
it would also include work on tree farms, except those tree farm establishments that meet the definition of agriculture contained in 29 u.s.c. 203(f).
the exemption, contained in section 13(c)(7) of the flsa, allows eligible youth, under specific conditions, to be employed inside and outside of places of business that use machinery to process wood products, but does not allow such youth to operate or assist in operating power-driven woodworking machines.
the work of assisting in the operation of a crane, derrick, or hoist would be prohibited because such tasks fall within the scope of tending of equipment.
the school is located in a neighborhood where 20 percent of those attending the local public school drop out annually and the high school graduation rate of the local public school is 55 percent.
assisting the operator of the forklift.
ho 14 also prohibits such minors from setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning circular saws, band saws, and guillotine shears.
penalties in the following manner: (1)(i) any person who violates the provisions of sections 212 or 213(c) of the flsa, relating to child labor, or any regulation issued pursuant to such sections, shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed: (a) $11,000 for each employee who was the subject of such a violation; or (b) $50,000 with regard to each such violation that causes the death or serious injury of any employee under the age of 18 years, which penalty may be doubled where the violation is a repeated or willful violation.

under the network's model, four students share a single, full-time clerical position with a private employer at a work place screened and selected by the school.
the department received six comments on its enforcement position that defines the term school in session as applying to the normal hours of the public school system in the minor employee's district of residence.
likewise, the department has consistently taken the position, starting as early as 1959, that ho 5 (occupations involved in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines) prohibits these same minors from using chain saws to cut wood and wood products, including trees and branches.
the report also recommends, alternatively, that the department consider developing a new ho that would prohibit all sawing machinery that performs cutting and sawing functions through direct contact of the cutting surface and the material being processed.
she also addressed the position of water slide dispatcher, stating ``we see no reason or evidence that this is a dangerous job that should be restricted.''
it also raises concerns that the ``host employer'' might not be subject to the same restrictions and requirements as any other employer who hires youth and that students may be replacing a ``regular paid employee.''
the department has also long taken the position that ho 5 prohibits the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to operate wood chippers to grind tree limbs, branches, and trunks into chips, mulch, or debris.
the cristo rey network, which described itself as ``a non-profit corporation that co-ordinates twelve college prep high schools across the country,'' self-identified itself as the network that the department describes in the nprm.
the clc is correct in its interpretation that 14- and 15-year-olds are permitted under sec. 570.34(a)(4) (old) and sec. 570.34(g) (new) to perform errand and delivery work by foot, bicycle, and public transportation for their employers when their employers are not engaged in the business of providing messenger services to others.

packing shakes into bundles when done in conjunction with splitting shakes manually with a froe and mallet, except inside the mill building or cover.
they stated that such employment includes the potential for exposure to hazardous and toxic chemicals or to bloodborne pathogens, particularly in medical and dental offices, hospitals and nursing homes, and when youth accept employment with professional janitorial services.
the department's review of these new standards, which included input from niosh, concluded that the 2008 ansi standards are also as protective as those cited in the compactor and baler act.
but the department believes that, by continuing its past practice of carefully reviewing inquiries regarding individual occupations or industries not currently addressed by reg. 3 and then exercising its prosecutorial discretion and issuing enforcement positions that may eventually lead to rulemaking--as evidenced by certain revisions contained in this final rule--it has developed an efficient and effective mechanism which overcomes the limitations of a definitive list.
the department does not interpret the helper prohibition as applying to 14- and 15-year-olds who simply ride inside a motor vehicle as passengers and, thus, reg. 3 permits a 14- or 15-year-old, under certain circumstances, to ride inside the enclosed passenger compartment of a motor vehicle operated by a driver whose employment complies with the conditions specified in ho 2.
the department's proposal to prohibit youth peddling was not limited to just the attempt to make a sale or the actual consummation of a sale, but includes such activities normally associated with and conducted as part of the individual youth peddler's sales activities, such as the loading and unloading of vans or other motor vehicles, the stocking and restocking of sales kits and trays, the exchanging of cash and checks, and the transportation of minors to and from the various sales areas by the employer.
the dol has slightly increased the total burden hour estimate from 1585 hours to 1586 to align the data with what appears in the general services administration, regulatory information service center and the omb, office of information and regulatory affairs combined information system (rocis) used to track the burdens imposed by federal government information collections.

570.65 occupations involving the operation of circular saws, band saws, guillotine shears, chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers, and abrasive cutting discs (order 14).
for example, the occupational safety and health act of 1970 directed the department of labor to adopt the then-existing ansi standards, rather than delay any activity until the agency promulgated particular occupational safety and health standards (see section 6(a) of the occupational safety and health act, 29 u.s.c. 655(a)).
the department appreciates the concerns of the ywn and clc regarding the use of certain power-driven pizza dough rollers, but again notes that its enforcement experience indicates that when employers properly apply all the provisions of the enforcement position--which have been included in the proposed limited exemption-- 16- and 17-year-olds can safely operate such equipment.
as used in this paragraph (m): inside or outside places of business shall mean the actual physical location of the establishment employing the youth, including the buildings and surrounding land necessary to the business operations of that establishment.
all occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage-stock mill shall mean all work performed in or about any such mill in connection with storing of logs and bolts; converting logs or bolts into sawn lumber, lathers, shingles, or cooperage stock; storing drying, and shipping lumber, laths, shingles, cooperage stock, or other products of such mills; and other work performed in connection with the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage-stock mill.
accordingly, the department issued an anprm, in conjunction with and on the same day as the nprm, that sought information from the public on this and other issues.
in early 2005, the department, after reviewing additional information, extended this enforcement position to permit the employment of 15-year-olds as lifeguards at all traditional swimming pools regardless of who owns, operates or manages the establishments, and at those facilities of water amusement parks that constitute traditional swimming pools.
as discussed previously, in order for an employer to avail itself of the limited exemption contained in sec. 570.63(c)(1) that permits 16- and 17-year-olds under certain conditions to load, but not operate or unload, certain scrap paper balers and paper box compactors, the employer must determine that the equipment meets an appropriate ansi standard listed in ho 12.

the occupations of operation or assisting to operate any compactor that is designed or used to process materials other than paper.
thus, the fact that a child's occupation involves the performance of work which is considered exempt from the child labor provisions will not relieve his employer from the requirements of section 12(c) or the producer, manufacturer, or dealer from the requirements of section 12(a) if, during the course of his employment, the child spends any part of his time doing work which is covered but not so exempt. 0 22.

k. occupations involved in the operation of circular saws, band saws, and guillotine shears (order 14) (29 cfr 570.65) ho 14 generally prohibits the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds in the occupations of operator or helper on power-driven circular saws, band saws, and guillotine shears, except those that are properly guarded and equipped with devices for full automatic feeding and ejection.
despite the department's consistent interpretation that 14- and 15- year-olds may not be employed as poultry catchers, employers still have questions concerning how the regulations address such work, and violations still occur.
the occupations of setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning circular saws, band saws, guillotine shears, chain saws, reciprocating saws, wood chippers, and abrasive cutting discs.
the department has incorporated certain provisions of the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 (gina) into 29 cfr parts 570 and 579 to implement the legislation, which revised the civil monetary penalties that may be assessed under section 16(e) of the flsa.
the term places of business where machinery is used to process wood products shall mean such permanent workplaces as sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, cooperage stock mills, furniture and cabinet making shops, gazebo and shed making shops, toy manufacturing shops, and pallet shops.
employees at these newly permitted work sites routinely use power-driven equipment that process materials that may not be included in the current definition of power-driven woodworking machines contained in ho 5, such as trees, logs, and lumber.
this is because sec. 570.33(a) (old and new) prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in almost all occupations involving processing operations--which the department has interpreted to include dry cleaning and laundering, the treating and disposing of waste, the conducting of mass mailings, and the painting of houses and automobiles.
the economic and social costs associated with the deaths and serious injuries of young workers are substantial.
these standards are incorporated by reference as they exist on the date of the approval; if any changes are made in these standards which the secretary finds to be as protective of the safety of minors as the current standards, the secretary will publish a notice of the change of standards in the federal register.

the department believes by adopting in reg. 3 the identical language contained in ho 2 (see sec. 570.52(b)), it not only provides a high degree of protection to young workers but also avoids potential confusion.
the youth does not operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines; (iii)
although the statute does not define the terms adult and relative, the department proposed that, for purpose of this exemption, a relative would include a parent (or person standing in place of a parent), a grandparent, an aunt, an uncle, and a sibling; and an adult would be someone who has reached his or her eighteenth birthday.
as previously mentioned, reg. 3 was revised to reflect the 1961 amendments to the flsa which extended the act's coverage to include enterprises engaged in commerce or the production of goods for commerce and thereby brought more working youth employed in retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments within the protections of the act.
the department agrees with the recommendations of both the ywn and clc that the regulatory text be revised to specifically state that 14- and 15-year-olds may not be employed as sign-wavers, promoting particular products, services, or events, except when performing the sign waving activities directly in front of an establishment providing the product, service or event.
the child labor provisions of the flsa permit 16- and 17- year-olds to work in the nonagricultural sector without hours or time limitations, except in certain occupations found and declared by the secretary to be particularly hazardous or detrimental to the health or well-being of such workers.
the ywn also stated that work as a lifeguard may entail exposure to combative individuals, bloodborne pathogens, and chemicals.
this exemption would not apply to tasks performed at locations other than inside or outside the place of business of the employer such as the delivery of items to customers or the installation of items at customers' establishments or residences.

cristo rey noted that the schools in the network provide an option for private education to children who are ``predominantly latino (63%) or african-american (25%) and who are all from economically-disadvantaged families; the average family income of these students is approximately $33,000--far too little to make private education an option absent the work-study program that the schools in the network have pioneered.''
participating youths are assigned to assist an instructor, are never left alone to teach a class, and also help during recreational swims ``by checking in/out patrons bags/apparel/ belongings.''
* * (1) the killing and processing of rabbits or small game in areas physically separated from the killing floor.
expanding this definition thus clarifies that youth are prohibited from operating or assisting in the operation of wood- processing machinery typically found in the workplaces covered by the 2004 amendment.

citing data from the census of fatal occupational injuries (cfoi), the report identified 82 fatalities of workers between 1992 and 1997 employed in the forestry industry as a whole, which includes establishments primarily engaged in the operation of timber tracts, tree farms, forest nurseries and those providing related forest service activities such as cruising and estimating timber, reforestation, fire prevention and fire fighting, pest control, timber valuation, and the gathering of forest products.
the report also did not consider potential approaches for decreasing workplace injuries and fatalities that provide an alternative to a complete ban on employment, such as safety training, increased supervision, the use of effective personal protective equipment, and strict adherence to recognized safe working practices.
these are the exemptions for employees engaged in the delivery of newspapers to the consumer and homeworkers engaged in the making of wreaths composed principally of evergreens.\3\ apart from these two exceptions, none of the specific exemptions from the minimum wage and/or overtime pay requirements applies to the child labor provisions.

the occupations of operation or assisting to operate any baler that is designed or used to process materials other than paper.
participating employers are also required to sign an agreement defining job duties and expectations.
however, the department believes that by continuing the long-standing reg. 3 tradition of publishing lists of those occupations and industries in which such youth may be employed as well as detailed examples of those industries and occupations in which the employment of such youth is prohibited, it can greatly enhance the public's understanding of these important provisions.
however, as the report implies, the use of chain saws by 16- and 17-year-olds would not be prohibited when cutting other materials such as metal, concrete, stone, and ice.
fourteen- and 15-year-olds may conduct sales in such employer's exterior facilities, whether temporary or permanent, as garden centers, sidewalk sales, and parking lot sales, when they are employed by that establishment.

the flsa would require that students participating in the work-study program, if covered by the act and not exempt from the minimum wage requirements of section 6, receive the applicable minimum wage for all hours worked.
the department believes that the standards established by osha to address such potential exposures, which are continually under agency review, provide vigorous protections to all workers.
broilers, automatic broiler systems, high speed ovens, and rapid toaster machines used at both quick service and full- service restaurants to toast such items as buns, bagels, sandwiches, and muffins--all of which operate at high temperatures, often in excess of 500 [deg]f--are not toasters under sec.

the department also proposed to revise reg. 3 at sec. 570.34(o) (new) to permit 14- and 15-year-olds to ride in the enclosed passenger compartments of motor vehicles, except when a significant reason for the minors being passengers in the vehicle is for the purpose of performing work in connection with the transporting--or assisting in the transporting--of other persons or property.
it felt that the proposal was so narrowly tailored to one specific program that it could easily bar other school systems ``that have similar, but not identical, approaches'' from taking advantage of the program.
sec. 570.33(f) and (k) and 570.34(k) to incorporate the enforcement position that allows 14- and 15-year-olds to be employed to load onto and unload from motor vehicles the light non-power-driven personal hand tools they use as part of their employment and to make it available to all covered employers, not just state and local governments.

it also prohibits the occupations of off-bearing from circular saws and from guillotine-action veneer clippers.
the department's enforcement experience confirms that employers have many ways of ensuring that, should they wish to take advantage of the limited exception contained in flsa section 13(c)(5), their balers and compactors comply with the appropriate ansi standard.
these standards are incorporated by reference as they exist on the date of the approval; if any changes are made in these standards which the secretary finds to be as protective of the safety of minors as the current standards, the secretary will publish a notice of the change of standards in the federal register.

it also ensures that the consistent application of these terms for both agricultural and nonagricultural employment will continue, thereby avoiding confusion among those employers who offer both agricultural and nonagricultural employment to young workers.
finally, the department notes that the clc takes exception to the department not taking any action on the niosh report recommendation regarding the limited exemption contained in ho 12 for student-learners and apprentices.
the department also proposed, for the sake of brevity and clarity, not to repeat the list of individual hos as they are already listed in subpart e of 29 cfr part 570.

(2) in the case of minors 14 and 15 years of age who are employed to perform sports-attending services at professional sporting events, i.e., baseball, basketball, football, soccer, tennis, etc., the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6) of this section shall not apply, provided that the duties of the sports-attendant occupation consist of pre- and post-game or practice setup of balls, items and equipment; supplying and retrieving balls, items and equipment during a sporting event; clearing the field or court of debris, moisture, etc., during play; providing ice, drinks, towels, etc., to players during play; running errands for trainers, managers, coaches, and players before, during, and after a sporting event; and returning and/or storing balls, items and equipment in club house or locker room after a sporting event.
(3) exceptions from certain of the hours standards contained in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section are provided for the employment of minors who are enrolled in and employed pursuant to a school-supervised work-experience and career exploration program as detailed in sec.
the effect of these orders is to raise the minimum age for employment to 18 years in the occupations covered.
as an estimated one-third of work-related injuries are seen in emergency departments, it is likely that approximately 146,000 youth sustain work-related injuries and illnesses each year.
although section 13(c)(7) permits the employment of certain youth inside and outside of places of business where machinery is used to process wood products, it does so only if the youth do not operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines.
collectively, they would not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy or its individual sectors, productivity, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal governments or communities.
as an estimated one-third of work-related injuries are seen in emergency departments, it is likely that approximately 146,000 youth sustain work-related injuries and illnesses each year.
[[page 28458]] abrasive cutting disc shall mean a machine equipped with a disc embedded with abrasive materials used for cutting materials.
for example, ho 10 prohibits a minor from operating a meat slicer in a restaurant to cut cheese or vegetables.
while the department agrees with the clc that it is unlikely that many such schools or home-schooling programs would materialize, it does note that the emergence of schools that were designed to allow migrant children to work on farms during the daylight hours when the local public school was in session, was an impetus for the 1949 amendment to the flsa that codified this very same enforcement position as it relates to agricultural employment.
although the report notes that there was almost no data specific to workers 16 and 17 years of age, the cfoi identifies 35 deaths in timber tract operations for all age groups between 1992 and 1997 and 39 deaths in forestry service operations for all age groups during the same period.
the employer will be held responsible for any violations of the flsa or the child labor regulations.
recently, the department adopted an enforcement policy that it would not assert violations of ho 11 when 16- and 17-year-olds operate, assist to operate, setup, adjust, repair, oil, or clean certain small, lightweight, counter-top mixers.
v. executive order 12866; regulatory flexibility this final rule is being treated as a ``significant regulatory action'' within the meaning of e.o. 12866 because of its importance to the public and the department's priorities.
in addition to affirming the department's position that a skid loader was a ``high-lift truck'' within the meaning of ho 7, the court also found that the youths' operation of the equipment violated the ho even though the youth did not operate or utilize the loader's hoisting device but used the skid-steer loader as a ``scraper'' (see lynnville transport, inc. v. chao, 316 f. supp.
the regulatory changes that implement these statutory changes do no more than conform the previously-existing regulations to the recent statutory amendments and do not impose any economic costs on employers that are required to comply with the provisions of sections 12 and 13(c) of the flsa.
the department appreciates the comments of the afl-cio and the clc concerning the omission of abrasive cutting discs from the list of prohibited equipment contained in ho 14.
it is important to note that this requirement of close, direct, and uninterrupted supervision, just like the requirement that youth not operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machinery, applies to the employment of 16- and 17-year- olds as well as 14- and 15-year-olds.
as the clc stated, ``dol's osha experts are familiar with these hazards.''
it added that, for these reasons, other organizations like the ymca do not certify lifeguards until age 16 and thus ``dol's argument that this proposal ties dol enforcement practice to `standards' in the industry is not accurate.''
this over-riding of an important safety device required by each of the ansi standards was done to speed up the loading process.
it does not include work that involves cutting, scraping, or trimming meat from cuts containing bones.
* (c) another distinction is that the exemptions provided by the act from the minimum wage and/or overtime provisions are more numerous and differ from the exemptions granted from the child labor provisions.
that penalty may be doubled up to $100,000 if the violation is determined to be a repeated or willful violation.
for these reasons, the department does not agree with the ywn's understanding that the existing regulation prohibits 14- and 15-year- olds from operating blenders that create ice cream desserts as the department has previously opined that this equipment is a type of ``milk shake blender'' which has long been permitted by sec.
to protect young workers from hazardous employment, the flsa provides for a minimum age of 18 years in occupations found and declared by the secretary to be particularly hazardous or detrimental to the health or well-being for minors 16 and 17 years of age.
in three of the four weeks, the participant is permitted to work during school hours on only one day per week, and for no more than for eight hours on that day.
the clc stated that ``[w]hat is particularly troubling-- and what dol does not indicate in its preamble to the proposed regulation--is that the only school system that appears to qualify for the proposed program is a private roman catholic system.''
g. occupations involved in the operation of power-driven hoisting apparatus (order 7) (29 cfr 570.58) ho 7 generally prohibits 16- and 17-year-olds from employment in occupations that involve the work of: (1) operating an elevator, crane, derrick, hoist, or high-lift truck except such youth may operate unattended automatic operation passenger elevators and electric or air operated hoists not exceeding one ton capacity; (2) riding on a manlift or on a freight elevator, except a freight elevator operated by an assigned operator; and (3) assisting in the operation of a crane, derrick or hoist performed by crane hookers, crane chasers, hookers-on, riggers, rigger helpers, and like occupations.
(new)), requiring that the door be kept open while they are inside the freezer could be unnecessarily burdensome in that, for energy efficiency and food sanitation, most freezers are equipped with self-closing doors.
the u.s. department of energy has also reported that in 2002 an adult worker injured his larynx when the reciprocating saw he was operating kicked back and cut him in his lower throat.
before 14- and 15-year-olds may legally perform work covered by the flsa, the act requires that the work itself be exempt, or that the secretary determines that the work to be performed does not constitute oppressive child labor.
supervised means that the youth's on-the-job activities must be directed, monitored, overseen, and controlled by certain named adults.
except, this exception shall not apply when the mixer is used, with or without attachments, to process meat or poultry products as prohibited by sec. 570.61(a)(4).
the niosh report recommends that ho 14 be expanded to cover other machines, such as chain saws, that perform cutting and sawing functions through direct contact between the cutting surfaces and the materials.
accordingly, the department has revised the regulatory language in sec. 570.54(a)(2).
moreover, the amendment's strong safety-affecting requirements that such youth not operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines, use personal protective equipment to prevent exposure to excessive levels of noise and sawdust, and be protected from wood particles and other flying debris within the workplace, should significantly reduce potential costs resulting from accidents and injuries to minors on the job.
loading of personal hand tools onto motor vehicles and riding on motor vehicles (sec.
finally, on may 21, 2008, after publication of the nprm, the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 (gina), public law 110-233, was signed into law.
any costs that might result from using older employees to perform the previously permitted tasks would be more than offset by reduced health and productivity costs resulting from accidents and injuries to minors on the job.
the clc commented that ``[if] the school day schedules established by private schools and by parents of home-schooled children could determine when children being educated in those settings governed here, there would be nothing in the dol child labor regulations that would prevent such a school or parent from setting a schedule that would permit children to work during the hours that the public school system is in session.
this is because the report also recommended the creation of a new ho that would prohibit all work in construction occupations which, if adopted, would impact the provisions of not only ho 4 but several other hos.
as supported by the provisions of the compactor and baler act, the final rule expanded the coverage of ho 12 to include those balers and paper box compactors that process other materials in addition to paper products.
the clc described private messenger services as those that ``have standing contracts with law firms, accounting firms, and other types of businesses'' to deliver documents or packages.
in accordance with requirements of the paperwork reduction act (pra), 44 u.s.c. 3501 et seq., and its attendant regulations, 5 cfr part 1320, the department seeks to minimize the paperwork burden for individuals, small businesses, educational and nonprofit institutions, federal contractors, state, local and tribal governments, and other persons resulting from the collection of information by or for the agency.
570.54 forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention occupations, timber tract occupations, forestry service occupations, logging occupations, and occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage stock mill (order 4).
the department appreciates the report's recommendation to continue emphasizing enforcement of portions of the compactor and baler act requiring that balers and compactors conform to construction and operations standards that greatly reduce exposure to hazardous energy.
this provision is designed to prevent such youth from being injured by contact with the machines' sharp blades and cutting surfaces.
it also ensures that the consistent application of these terms for both agricultural and nonagricultural employment will continue, thereby avoiding confusion among those employers who offer both agricultural and nonagricultural employment to young workers.
such 14-year-old employees could not be employed as lifeguards or swim instructors, but could perform such tasks as maintaining the cleanliness of the pool area and locker rooms, signing in and signing out patrons, and checking in and out such items as towels, watches, and apparel.
(2) work in the construction, operation, repair, or maintenance of living and administrative quarters, including logging camps and fire fighting base camps.
(e) price marking and tagging by hand or machine, assembling orders, packing, and shelving.
additional lifeguard duties may include checking in and out items such as towels and personal items such as rings, watches and apparel.
this is because sec. 570.33(a) (old and new) prohibits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds in almost all occupations involving processing operations--which the department has interpreted to include dry cleaning and laundering, the treating and disposing of waste, the conducting of mass mailings, and the painting of houses and automobiles.
in its document 5108, weed trimmers can throw objects and injure eyes, the u.s. consumer product safety commission estimated that, in 1989, there were approximately 4,600 injuries associated with power lawn trimmers or edgers that required emergency room treatment.
the department, however, does not agree that such an expansion of positive youth opportunities is improper or in any way fails to comport with the requirements and spirit of flsa section 3(l).
portable sawmill shall mean a sawmilling operation where no office or repair or maintenance shop is ordinarily maintained, and any lumberyard operated in conjunction with the sawmill is used only for the temporary storage of green lumber.
the clc stated that ``most distressing is the fact that dol gives no indication of what the red cross training requires.''
in response to information presented by several restaurants and employer associations, the department adopted an enforcement position in 1990 that it would not assert a violation of ho 11 when a 16- or 17- year-old employee operated a pizza-dough roller, a type of dough sheeter, when the machine: (1) is constructed with safeguards contained in the basic design so as to prevent fingers, hands, or clothing from being caught in the in-running point of the rollers; (2) has gears that are completely enclosed; and (3) has microswitches that disengage the machinery if the backs or sides of the rollers are removed.
570.37 (new) to operate a work-study program for just one student, one group of students, or, as in the case of the cristo rey network, the entire student body.
traditional swimming pool means a water tight structure of concrete, masonry, or other approved materials located either indoors or outdoors, used for bathing or swimming and filled with a filtered and disinfected water supply, together with buildings, appurtenances and equipment used in connection therewith, excluding elevated ``water slides.''
in addition to the regularly scheduled visits to the workplaces the teacher-coordinator is required to make, the department suggests that such things as frequent interactions with the work-study program students, program assessments and evaluations completed by the students and the employers, and surprise or unscheduled visits to the workplaces can all contribute to the operation of a safe, compliant, and positive work-study program.
this exemption would not apply to tasks performed at locations other than inside or outside the place of business of the employer such as the delivery of items to customers or the installation of items at customers' establishments or residences.
although, as mentioned above, some employers would need to replace younger workers with older workers, the impact would be minimal as relatively few minors are currently employed to perform these occupations.
the department notes the clc's concerns that determining when school is in session by using each student's individual academic schedule could foster the development of nonpublic schools or home- schooling programs created primarily to provide 14- and 15-year-old working children to employers during the hours they would normally have attended public school.
in addition, because atvs are motor vehicles as defined by sec. 570.52(c) (old and new), 14- and 15-year-olds would be prohibited from operating such equipment under sec.
(ix) manual loading of bundles of shingles or shakes into trucks or railroad cars, provided that the employer has on file a statement from a licensed doctor of medicine or osteopathy certifying the [[page 28454]] minor capable of performing this work without injury to himself, except minors under 16 years of age may not load bundles of shingles or shakes into trucks or railroad cars as they are prohibited from loading and unloading goods or property onto or from motor vehicles, railroad cars, or conveyors by sec. 570.33(k) of this part.
for example, the section of reg. 3 that prohibits 14- and 15-year-olds from employment in occupations in connection with warehousing and storage would be cited as sec. 570.33(f)(2)(old) or sec. 570.33(n)(2)(new).
the employment of a 14- or 15-year-old who by statute or judicial order is exempt from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade inside or outside places of business where machinery is used to process wood products
in addition, the ywn would require that the driver of the vehicle transporting the minors have a valid driver's license.
the clc objected to the department's proposal, stating that it did not have sufficient information on the underlying rationale for the proposed change to adequately comment on it.
minors under 16 years of age may not be employed as dispatchers or attendants at the top of elevated water slides performing such tasks as maintaining order, directing patrons as to when to depart the top of the slide, and ensuring that patrons have begun their ``ride'' safely.
all occupations in forestry services shall mean all work involved in the support of timber production, wood technology, forestry economics and marketing, and forest protection.
j. occupations involved in the operation of paper-products machines, scrap paper balers, and paper box compactors (order 12) (29 cfr 570.63)
the report notes that substantial numbers of fatalities occur among workers who are passengers on forklifts, riding on the forks, or working from the raised forklift attachments (see niosh report, page 36).
such students may, in accordance with 29 cfr 531.40, make a voluntary assignment of their wages to a third party.
a strict adherence to reg. 3 requirements would not permit the employment of a 14- or 15- year-old in any of these scenarios, even though talented and motivated youth could safely and successfully perform these tasks without interfering with their schooling or health and well-being.
570.54, logging occupations and occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage stock mill (order 4).
there is, thus, no corresponding environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement.
sic 083 encompasses those establishments primarily engaged in growing trees for purposes of reforestation or in gathering forest products.
any other provisions of the program providing safeguards ensuring that the employment permitted under this section will not interfere with the schooling of the minors or with their health and well-being may also be submitted for use in considering the application.
fourteen- and 15-year-olds could not be employed to clean such work places, even after hours, because of whd's long-standing interpretation that a work place retains its character--and child labor continues to be prohibited--even at times when nothing is being mined, processed, or manufactured.
such equipment required that the worker place the ice cream, milk, and flavorings in a stainless steel mixing cup that generally has a maximum capacity of 20 ounces.
the exemption also prohibits the minor from performing any driving involving the towing of vehicles; route deliveries or route sales; the transportation for hire of property, goods, or passengers; urgent, time-sensitive deliveries; or the transporting of more than three passengers at any one time.
any administrative determination by the secretary of the amount of any penalty under section 216(e) of the flsa shall be final, unless within 15 days after receipt of notice thereof by certified mail the person charged with the violation takes exception to the determination that the violations for which the penalty is imposed occurred, in which event final determination of the penalty shall be made in an administrative proceeding after opportunity for hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5, united states code, and regulations to be promulgated by the secretary.
accordingly, the department issued an anprm, in conjunction with and on the same day as the nprm, to solicit public comment on this important issue.
operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines shall mean the operating of such machines, including supervising or controlling the operation of such machines, feeding material into such machines, helping the operator feed material into such machines, unloading materials from such machines, and helping the operator unload materials from such machines.
with regard to cooking and the use of kitchen equipment, the department notes that it implemented new rules concerning the types of cooking that may be performed by 14- and 15-year-olds in its final rule published in the federal register on december 16, 2004 (69 fr 75382).
the report notes that while these large specialized balers are generally found in facilities that specialize in processing scrap and waste materials, smaller general-purpose portable machines that serve the same functions are marketed for use in businesses such as grocery stores, hotels, restaurants, and hospitals.
the department agrees with the clc that the adoption of this proposal will allow 14- and 15-year-olds to be employed to perform office work for such employers as accounting firms, advertising agencies, and insurance companies; and that such youth could, under the proper circumstances, work as many as eight hours in a day and forty hours in a week when school is not in session.
the wage and hour division has consulted with representatives of the department's occupational safety and health administration (osha) and will defer to that agency's expertise and guidance when determining whether an employer is in compliance with the safety provisions of this exemption--i.e., whether a workplace barrier is appropriate to the potential hazard, whether a sufficient distance has been maintained from machinery in operation, and whether the youth is exposed to excessive levels of noise and saw dust.
since subpart g was last revised, not only have several hos been amended, but the process for promulgating and revising the hos has also changed.
the department's administration of this enforcement position permitting the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds by state and local governments has had extremely positive results.
not included in the definition of a traditional swimming pool would be such natural environment swimming facilities as rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, quarries, reservoirs, wharfs, piers, canals, or oceanside beaches.
reg. 3, originally promulgated in 1939, was revised to reflect the 1961 amendments to the flsa, which extended the act's coverage to include enterprises engaged in commerce or the production of goods for commerce and thereby brought more working youth employed in retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments within the protections of the act.
570.33(j): prohibited youth peddling also includes such promotion activities as the holding, wearing, or waving of signs, costumes, sandwich boards, or placards in order to attract potential customers, except when performed inside of, or directly in front of, the employer's establishment providing the product, service, or event being advertised.
broilers, automatic broiler systems, high speed ovens, and rapid toaster machines used at both quick service and full- service restaurants to toast such items as buns, bagels, sandwiches, and muffins--all of which operate at high temperatures, often in excess of 500 [deg]f--are not toasters under sec.
years of age (29 cfr 570.31-.34) section 3(l) of the flsa defines oppressive child labor to expressly prohibit children under the age of 16 from performing any work other than that which the secretary of labor permits, by order or regulation, upon [[page 28407]] finding that it does not interfere with their schooling or health and well-being (see 29 u.s.c. 203(l), see also 29 cfr 570.117-.119).
the department notes that although niosh did not include injury data specific to the operation of abrasive cutting discs, niosh did report that the potential contact with the moving disk of an abrasive cutting tool does put operators at risk.
the clc ``welcomed'' the expansion of the prohibitions of ho 12 to include balers and compactors designed or used to process materials other than paper.
the department would also note that, as mentioned by the clc, 14- and 15-year-olds have been permitted to be employed by hospitals and nursing homes for many years.
the limitations on the number of hours that participating students may be employed (see sec. 570.37(c) (new)), though in line with those established by the cristo rey network, constitute the absolute maximum number of hours that participants may be employed.
although flsa section 13(c)(7) does not impact the prohibitions of ho 5 because eligible youth are still prevented from operating power-driven woodworking machinery, it does expand the types of workplaces where certain youth may be employed to include sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, and cooperage stock mills as well as other workplaces the department's final rule includes under reg. 3 and ho 4.
rules that limit permissible job activities for working youth to those that are safe do not, by themselves, impose significant added costs on employers, in our view.
this rule is not subject to e.o. 12630, because it does not involve implementation of a policy ``that has takings implications'' or that could impose limitations on private property use.
in addition to changing the title of ho 4 to accommodate this revision, the department has also added definitions of the terms all occupations in forestry services and all occupations in timber tracts to sec. 570.54(b).
the department appreciates the support and concerns of the commenters.
the department believes that by continuing to reference certain common prohibited machinery by name, both clarity and compliance will be increased.
the report, citing cfoi data, reflects that there were 99 worker deaths associated with truck mounted bucket or basket hoists between 1992 and 1997 (see niosh report, page 37).
the department appreciates and understands the commenters' concerns about the potential occupational exposure of young workers to hazardous and toxic chemicals or to bloodborne pathogens.
niosh notes that work in sic 083, forest nurseries and gathering of forest products, is associated with very small numbers of fatalities and should not be prohibited by ho 4.
for example, ho 10 prohibits a minor from operating a meat slicer in a restaurant to cut cheese or vegetables.
the department agreed with the niosh report recommendation that ho 4 should be expanded to cover work in forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention because of the risks inherent in those occupations.
the department notes that the exemption from minimum wage and overtime contained in section 13(a)(1) for outside salespeople does not apply to individuals employed solely to wave signs or wear placards, sandwich boards, or costumes to attract potential customers as such promotion work is not performed in conjunction with sales actually made by those individuals (see sec. 541.503).
* * had the highest lifetime risk of fatal injury of any industry, at 47 deaths per 1,000 workers based on an analysis of national traumatic occupational fatality surveillance system data for 1990 and 1991.
570.62(b)(2) would apply only when all the safeguards detailed above are present on the machines, are operational, and have not been overridden.
the department is aware that permitting 15-year-olds to be employed as lifeguards at such water amusement park facilities as lazy rivers, wave pools, and the splashdown pools of elevated slides could be construed as allowing these youth to tend power-driven machinery.
it will not have a significant adverse effect on the supply, distribution or use of energy.
but the employer (tenant) must exercise due vigilance, for should the notice be inaccurate or incomplete--i.e., the baler or compactor fails to meet the appropriate ansi standard, or the notice fails to fully identify the appropriate ansi standard--the burden of compliance remains with the employer (tenant) of any youth who loaded the equipment.
cfoi data reflect that during the period of 1994-2004, 15- year-olds experienced an occupational fatality rate of 4.7 fatalities per 100,000 workers--a rate that was greater than that experienced by all workers aged 15 and older.
[[page 28439]] finger while putting recyclables into an industrial waste compactor by hand.
the department is evaluating the alternative recommendation made by the report that it consider developing a new ho that combines the sawing machinery covered under ho 14 with other specialized machinery that performs cutting and sawing functions through direct contact of the cutting surface and the material.
the niosh report notes that the fatality rate for adolescents aged 16 and 17 was 5.1 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers for the 10-year period 1980-89
the public messenger goes between two parties, neither of whom is necessarily known to the messenger.
the term compensation would not include the small prizes, trophies, or other awards of minimal value that the eleemosynary organization may give a volunteer in recognition of his or her fund raising efforts.
places of business where machinery is used to process wood products shall mean such permanent workplaces as sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, cooperage stock mills, furniture and cabinet making shops, gazebo and shed making shops, toy manufacturing shops, and pallet shops.
(6) employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to load, but not operate or unload, certain scrap paper balers and paper box compactors under specified conditions.
the department does not believe it is appropriate to overturn the long-standing prohibitions against 14- and 15-year-olds being employed in construction or processing occupations by accepting the recommendation of the coosa valley regional development center to allow such youth to perform painting activities.
another example would be that 14- and 15-year-olds would be permitted to sculpt, but would be prohibited from welding and soldering or any functions that expose them to heat, or to height or other existing restrictions.''
helping those who are not academically oriented stay in school and complete their high school educations.
this difference is due to differences in how initial departmental efforts and rocis dealt with rounding issues.
the red cross recommended that the department [[page 28419]] alleviate possible public misunderstanding by deleting ``giving swimming instructions'' from the list of permitted lifeguard duties.
570.131 through 570.139 to accommodate any additional statutory amendments to the flsa child labor provisions that may be enacted.
the niosh statistics show that, despite the fact that workers aged 15 through 17 are generally restricted from employment in hazardous occupations such as mining, motor-vehicle driving, logging, sawmilling, and construction, they have a higher rate of injuries requiring emergency room treatment than any other age group except 18- and 19-year-olds (who are not restricted from performing such work).
in addition, each driver transporting the young workers must hold a state driver's license valid for the type of driving involved and, if the driver is under the age of 18, his or her employment must comply with the provisions of sec. 570.52.
permitted duties for 15-year-olds include the use of a ladder to access and descend from the lifeguard chair; the use of hand tools to clean the pool and pool area; and the testing and recording of water quality for temperature and/or ph levels, using all of the tools of the testing process including adding chemicals to the test water sample.
is a part, has clearly stated in sec. 570.33(b) for many years that 14- and 15-year-olds may not be employed in ``occupations which involve the operation or tending of hoisting apparatus or of any power-driven machinery other than office machines'' (emphasis added).
in three of the four weeks, the participant would be permitted to work during school hours on only one day per week, and for no more than eight hours on that day.
the clc stated ``[a]ny reasonable person who has seen such couriers rushing through city streets, dodging cars, pedestrians, and other cyclists to deliver important documents, would shudder to think that 14- and 15- year-olds would be able to do this work, if dol's proposal becomes the final regulation.''
any person who violates the provisions of sections 212 or 213(c) of the flsa, relating to child labor, or any regulation issued pursuant to such sections, shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed: (a) $11,000 for each employee who was the subject of such a violation; or (b) $50,000 with regard to each such violation that causes the death or serious injury of any employee under the age of 18 years, which penalty may be doubled where the violation is a repeated or willful violation.
no employer or employer association, when commenting on the 1999 or the 2007 nprm, reported that it was difficult or expensive to determine that their balers and/or compactors met or failed to meet the appropriate ansi standards.
the department associates no additional costs for the workplace observation requirement to ensure compliance with the flsa child labor provisions, because such monitoring will normally be conducted when school staff visit the workplace to see whether educational objectives are being met.
minors less than 16 years of age may not be employed as dispatchers or attendants at the top of elevated water slides-- employees who maintain order, direct patrons as to when to depart the top of the slide, and ensure that patrons have safely begun their ride--because such work constitutes ``tending'' as used in reg. 3.
other machines are intended specifically for processing a single product, such as metals.
this final rule revises the child labor regulations to incorporate statutory amendments to the fair labor standards act and to update and clarify the regulations that establish protections for youth employed in nonagricultural occupations.
the ywn also suggested that the department should clearly state in the final rule that school is considered to be in session during any week in which school attendance is required for one or more days.
the department also believes that continuation of this enforcement position is appropriate as it does not provide any minor or class of minors with an incentive to leave public school or with an unfair and improper advantage over public school youth when competing for employment.
traditional swimming pool means a water tight structure of concrete, masonry, or other approved materials located either indoors or outdoors, used for bathing or swimming and filled with a filtered and disinfected water supply, together with buildings, appurtenances and equipment used in connection therewith, excluding elevated ``water slides.''
moreover, the amendment's strong safety-affecting requirements that such youth not operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines, use personal protective equipment to prevent exposure to excessive levels of noise and sawdust, and be protected from wood particles and other flying debris within the workplace, should significantly reduce potential costs resulting from accidents and injuries to minors on the job.
although, as mentioned above, some employers would need to replace younger workers with older workers, the impact would be minimal as relatively few minors are currently employed to perform these occupations.
the department also recognizes the concerns of the ywn and clc over the department's decision not to limit the student-learner and apprentice exemption contained in ho 10 at this time.
in order to prevent confusion when providing citations in this discussion, the department will provide, when appropriate, both the current citation (the citation prior to the effective date of this final rule) and the new citation (the citation that will apply on and after the effective date of this final rule).

the implementation of revised subpart g of the child labor regulations, general statements of interpretation of the child labor provisions of the fair labor standards act of 1938, as amended, to incorporate all the changes made by the agency since this subpart was last revised in 1971, will simply provide compliance guidance on the child labor provisions detailed in earlier subparts of 570 and therefore imposes no economic costs.
these youth are often transported by crew leaders in vans, which fail to meet proper safety and insurance requirements, to areas quite distant from their home neighborhoods.
he also stated that limiting participation in the proposed work-study program to students enrolled in a college preparatory curriculum ``can also have the unintended consequence of denying extended work hours and compensation from those who need it the most, the undereducated.''

in the final rule issued in 2004, the department stated that it would publish a notice in the federal register when the secretary made any such certifications.
nonfatal injuries requiring time away from work are of moderate severity (see niosh report, page 48).
the department believes the hazards associated with the activities of extinguishing a forest fire warrant this prohibition and has clarified the definition of all occupations in forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention to note that such work is prohibited not only in all forest and timber tract locations, but also in logging operations, and sawmill operations, including all buildings located within such areas.

the department does not believe it is appropriate to overturn the long-standing prohibitions against 14- and 15-year-olds being employed in construction or processing occupations by accepting the recommendation of the coosa valley regional development center to allow such youth to perform painting activities.
the department has also replaced the words firefighting and firelines in the final rule with the words fire fighting and fire lines.

we note, as reported by the clc, that osha, which is the recognized expert in occupational safety and health issues, already has in place important safety standards addressing emergency release mechanisms, panic bars, and unobstructed paths in the workplace--and that these standards protect all workers, not just those under the age of 16.
an employer's violation of section 12 or section 13(c) of the act relating to child labor or any regulation issued pursuant to such sections, shall be deemed to be willful for purposes of this section where the employer knew that its conduct was prohibited by the act or showed reckless disregard for the requirements of the act.
the united states lifesaving association (usla), which described itself as america's nonprofit, professional association of beach lifeguards and open water rescuers, reported that it ``works to reduce the incidence of death and injury in the aquatic environment through public education, promulgation of national lifeguard standards, training programs, promotion of high levels of lifeguard readiness, and other means.''
they create steam at a temperature that ``clearly exceeds the temperature limits established for prohibiting use of other equipment such as anything related to hot oil that exceeds a temperature of 100 degrees f.'' a representative of the billings, montana job service also questioned how the department's proposal addresses the employment of youth who operate espresso machines.

such youth may not work during the hours school is in session--unless participating in a state sponsored wecep--and may not work more than three hours on a day the local public school is in session.
the department's proposal to prohibit youth peddling was not limited to just the attempt to make a sale or the actual consummation of a sale, but includes such activities normally associated with and conducted as part of the individual youth peddler's sales activities, such as the loading and unloading of vans or other motor vehicles, the stocking and restocking of sales kits and trays, the exchanging of cash and checks, and the transportation of minors to and from the various sales areas by the employer.
however, the list of prohibited occupations is not intended to identify every prohibited occupation, but rather only to provide examples of those prohibited occupations that have historically been the most common sources of violations or concern.
, she noted that her facility has ``swim instructors who are certified by the american red cross as water safety instructors, but are not lifeguard certified.''
the provisions of this exemption, which are contained in ho 12 (sec. 570.63) include that the scrap paper baler or compactor meet an applicable standard established by the american national standards institute (ansi) and identified in the statute, or a more recent ansi standard that the secretary of labor has found, incorporated by reference (see sec. 570.63), and declared to be as protective of the safety of young workers as the ansi standard named in the statute.

the department appreciates the concerns of certain commenters that 15-year-olds should be permitted to be employed as dispatchers or attendants at the top of elevated water slides, but believes that continuation of its long-held position that such employment constitutes the prohibited tending of power-driven equipment--just as it is for attendants on roller coasters, merry-go-rounds, and ski-lifts--is both prudent and proper.
the report, citing cfoi data, reflects that there were 99 worker deaths associated with truck mounted bucket or basket hoists between 1992 and 1997 (see niosh report, page 37).
neither commenter provided any data or insight regarding how extensively atvs are used by youth in nonagricultural employment or whether the documented hazards resulted in occupational injuries.
in other cases, the risk may be exaggerated by including more dangerous operations/industries in the injury, illness, or fatality estimates.
the proposed prohibition concerning the employment of youth in forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention would apply to all forest locations and buildings located within the forest, not just where logging or sawmilling takes place.
the department's enforcement experience led it to incorporate into the regulations certain long-standing enforcement positions involving the definitions of remanufacturing departments of sawmills (ho 4), high- lift trucks (ho 7), and the cleaning of power-driven meat processing equipment (ho 10).
in addition, the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor must include an on-off switch incorporating a key-lock or other system and the control of the system must be maintained in the custody of employees who are at least 18 years of age.
[[page 28420]] requirements contained in reg. 3, will end when the minor reaches his or her 16th birthday.
despite the department's consistent interpretation that 14- and 15- year-olds may not be employed as poultry catchers, employers still have questions concerning how the regulations address such work, and violations still occur.
poultry catching and cooping the department has long taken the position that 14- and 15-year- olds may not be employed to catch and coop poultry in preparation for transportation or for market because it is a ``processing'' occupation prohibited by sec. 570.33(a) (old and new).
typically, a crew leader attempts to saturate a particular area with sales crews, make as many sales as possible, and then quickly move to a new location.
these specific conditions, which are contained in ho 2 (sec. 570.52), include that the automobile or truck may not exceed 6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight, the driving must be restricted to daylight hours, the vehicle must be equipped with a seat belt or similar restraining device for the driver and for any passengers, and the employer must instruct the employee that such belts or other devices must be used.
in fact, depending upon the facts of each situation and the degree of control the school exercises over the employment of the participating student, it is possible that the student would be considered to be jointly employed by the host- employer and the youth's school under the flsa (see 29 cfr part 791).
the hearings included a staff study that documented many abuses that had occurred in this industry, including indentured servitude, physical and sexual abuse, and criminal activity.
even though, under this rule, 14- and 15-year-olds may only occasionally enter freezers momentarily to retrieve items (see sec. 570.33(i)

the students receive at least the applicable federal and state minimum wages, and applicable taxes are withheld and reported by their respective employers.
the employer must also post a notice on the machine that states, among other things, which applicable ansi standard the machine meets.
an analysis of the time it will take to prepare the application and written training agreements for a wsp and the associated recordkeeping suggests these educational institutions will each spend an average of about 52.5 hours more to comply with this final rule than might otherwise be spent to establish a similar work- study program.
finally, the department acknowledges the recommendations of the dolwd, the council, and the representative of white hat regarding the relaxation of certain of the hours and time of day restrictions of reg. 3 to permit 14- and 15-year-olds to work more hours on a school day or in a school week, or later into the evening.
the national council of chain restaurants (council), the representative of morey's pier, and the fmi supported defining the term school in session by following the academic schedule and attendance requirements of each minor, rather than that of the local public school.
the department does not agree with the clc's comment that the dol gives no indication of what red cross training requires and the ywn's comment that this proposal is not ``tied to standards in the industry.''
finally, the clc noted that the statute did not require woodworking establishments that employ youth under the provisions of flsa section 13(c)(7) to report all work-related accidents and deaths of such workers to the department.
the department is including this information in both sec. 570.62(b)(1) and sec. 570.61(a)(4)) to avoid confusion and facilitate compliance.
the current ho 10 exemption permitting the killing and processing of rabbits or small game in areas physically separated from the killing floor would not be changed.
youth may conduct sales in such employer exterior facilities, whether temporary or permanent, as garden centers, sidewalk sales, and parking lot sales, when employed by that establishment.

the report notes that the survey of occupational injuries and illnesses reports that in 1997, food and beverage processing machinery were responsible for 11,737 nonfatal injuries and illness that resulted in days away from work.
these specialized metal balers and compactors, which process such items as cars, radiators, and siding, may share similar designs and operating procedures with those compactors and balers that process only paper products or process other materials in addition to paper products.
poultry catching and cooping the department has long taken the position that 14- and 15-year- olds may not be employed to catch and coop poultry in preparation for transportation or for market because it is a ``processing'' occupation prohibited by sec. 570.33(a) (old and new).
such a reporting plan would allow an assessment as to whether the revision should be rescinded or further refined to best protect working youth (see niosh report, page 48).
it did not want the public mistakenly to believe that participation in the proposed work-study program would be limited to private schools, public schools, or any particular religious or nonreligious sect.
the department appreciates the concerns of both the ywn and the clc that the proposed work-study program, unlike the wecep, does not prohibit participating employers from displacing a worker already employed in the employer's establishment with a student (see sec. 570.36(e) (new)).
permitted duties for 15-year-olds would include the use of a ladder to access and descend from the lifeguard chair; the use of hand tools to clean the pool and pool area; and the testing and recording of water quality for temperature and/or ph levels, using all of the tools of the testing process including adding chemicals to the test water sample.
although the exemption allows certain youths between the ages of 14 and 18 years to be employed inside and outside of places of business that use power-driven machines to process wood products, it does so only if such youths do not operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines.
employers of wsp participants are also required to keep a copy of the written participation agreement for each student employed.
also in 2000, a municipality contacted the department inquiring whether it could legally employ such youth as lifeguards at its city-owned swimming pools.
in addition, such youth have been permitted to be employed, and have been safely employed, as janitors at many retail and food service establishments over the years, including department stores, hotels, amusement parks, restaurants, and large discount stores.
in addition, the department proposed to expand the ho that prohibits youth from operating power-driven circular saws, band saws, and guillotine shears to also prohibit the operation of power-driven chain saws, wood chippers, and reciprocating saws.
(o) work in connection with riding inside passenger compartments of motor vehicles except as prohibited by sec. 570.33(f) or sec. 570.33(j), or when a significant reason for the minor being a passenger in the vehicle is for the purpose of performing work in connection with the transporting--or assisting in the transporting of--other persons or property.
such minors may perform work in offices or repair or maintenance shops.
as the stated purposes of the hours standards limitations include the protection of young workers from exhaustion and the preservation of time for rest and family relations, no more than 3 hours of work is permitted on any day when school is in session.
such minors would not be permitted to load or unload such jobsite- related equipment as barriers, cones, or signage.
the rule does not have ``substantial direct effects on one or more indian tribes, on the relationship between the federal government and indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the federal government and indian tribes.''
the department firmly believes that the limited and public exercise of its prosecutorial discretion is an efficient and legal tool available to the secretary in the administration of the child labor provisions of the flsa.
just like in 1960 when ho 14 was first issued, the department is receiving reports of injuries and deaths, such as the ones described in the preceding paragraphs, of youth operating power-driven machines that may be prohibited when used to process certain types of materials and not prohibited when processing other types of materials.
it was the department's intention to qualify in the final rule which occupations, if any, would be permitted for 16- and 17-year- olds after the comments were reviewed.
the department will evaluate the information to determine if the program meets the requirements specified in the regulation, in order to respond to the request.
a school-supervised and school-administered work-study program shall meet the educational standards established and approved by the state educational agency in the respective state.
the department will add atvs to the list of prohibited equipment presented in the revised sec. 570.33(e) (new) as recommended by the afl-cio and clc.
in addition, the ywn would require that the driver of the vehicle transporting the minors have a valid driver's license.
the list of prohibited industries and occupations helps to define and to provide clarity to the list of permitted industries and occupations.
the department agrees with several commenters who noted that applying the same definition of the term week for determining compliance with the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of the flsa would make it much easier for employers to use their payroll systems as tools and tracking systems for implementing and maintaining compliance with the child labor requirements.
in addition, gina also permits the assessment of a civil money penalty not to exceed $50,000 with regard to each violation that caused the death or serious injury of any employee under the age of 18 years.
properly certified 15-year-old lifeguards may, however, be stationed at the ``splashdown pools'' located at the bottom of the elevated water slides to perform those permitted duties listed in this subsection.
the clc stated that a child permanently expelled from public school might still be required, under state or local law or perhaps court order, to attend some other school.
the occupation of lifeguard, as used in this subpart, entails the duties of rescuing swimmers in danger of drowning, the monitoring of activities at a swimming pool to prevent accidents, the teaching of water safety, and assisting patrons.

the fmi stated ``[w]e strongly object to this change, which would create an administrative nightmare, and see no reason for it.''
these smaller general- purpose machines operate in essentially the same manner as the larger machines and present similar risks of injury.
the city was advised that this enforcement policy did not extend to other prohibited transportation-related work such as the loading or unloading of materials other than the light hand tools the minors may use on-the-job, such as trash or garbage, or power-driven equipment such as lawn mowers, edgers, and weed trimmers--the use of which by this age group is prohibited under reg. 3.
in response to information presented by several restaurants and employer associations, the department adopted an enforcement position in 1990 that it would not assert a violation of ho 11 when a 16- or 17- year-old employee operated a pizza-dough roller, a type of dough sheeter, when the machine: (1) is constructed with safeguards contained in the basic design so as to prevent fingers, hands, or clothing from being caught in the in-running point of the rollers; (2) has gears that are completely enclosed; and (3) has microswitches that disengage the machinery if the backs or sides of the rollers are removed.
congress also provided the secretary of labor with flexibility when administering flsa section 13(c)(5) by allowing balers and compactors to meet any additional standards adopted by ansi if certified by the secretary to be at least as protective of the safety of minors as the standards contained in the compactor and baler act.
it is important to note that in those rare instances when the catching activities would be agricultural in nature, such as where poultry catchers are employed solely by a farmer on a farm to catch poultry raised by that farmer, the catchers would be subject to the agricultural child labor provisions contained in flsa sections 13(c)(1) and (2).
reg. 3 also incorporates by reference all of the prohibitions contained in the hazardous occupations orders (29 cfr 570.50-.68), which identify occupations that are ``particularly hazardous'' and, therefore, prohibited for 16- and 17-year-olds (e.g., occupations involved in the operation of power-driven metal forming, punching, and shearing machines, see sec. 570.33(e) (old) and sec. 570.33(b) (new)).
forestry workers also experienced fatal injuries such as those typically associated with the logging industry; in 26 of the 82 fatalities the worker was struck by a falling object (a tree in all but one instance).
in addition, the following exceptions do not apply to work which entails entering the sawmill building, except for those minors whose employment meets the requirements of the limited exemptions discussed in sec.
finally, a representative of the coosa valley regional development center requested that 14- and 15-year-olds be permitted to be employed in painting activities because the ``paint products in use today do not contain lead or other hazardous materials.''
in addition, some of this prohibited equipment, when used to process meat or mix batter--with or without the use of special ``attachments''--may not be operated by employees under the age of 18 because of the prohibitions of ho 10 or ho 11, respectively.
circular saws and band saws were already covered under ho 5 when used on wood, ho 10 when used on meat, and ho 12 when used on paper products.
the regulations concerning nonagricultural hazardous occupations are contained in subpart e of 29 cfr part 570 (29 cfr 570.50-.68).
as the stated purposes of the hours standards limitations include the protection of young workers from exhaustion and the preservation of time for rest and family relations, no more than 3 hours of work is permitted on any day when school is in session.
it expressed concerns that office equipment, such as large paper shredders and data processing machines with exposed moving parts, may present hazards to young workers.
the american journal of forensic medicine and pathology (volume 28, no. 4, december 2001) reports on the death of a 32-year-old male who lost his balance and fell on the blade of an electric reciprocating saw he was using to trim branches.
as previously mentioned, reg. 3 was revised to reflect the 1961 amendments to the flsa which extended the act's coverage to include enterprises engaged in commerce or the production of goods for commerce and thereby brought more working youth employed in retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments within the protections of the act.
any student 14 or 15 years of age, enrolled in a college preparatory curriculum, whom authoritative personnel from the school attended by the youth identify as being able to benefit from the program shall be able to participate.
young workers have been killed or seriously injured while operating wood chippers.
those conditions included that the youth be trained and certified in aquatics and water safety by the red cross or by some similarly recognized certifying organization, and that the youth work under conditions acceptable to the red cross or some similarly recognized certifying organization.
the report specifically notes the risk of falls and electrocution being linked with such equipment.
the department appreciates the concerns of certain commenters that 15-year-olds should be permitted to be employed as dispatchers or attendants at the top of elevated water slides, but believes that continuation of its long-held position that such employment constitutes the prohibited tending of power-driven equipment--just as it is for attendants on roller coasters, merry-go-rounds, and ski-lifts--is both prudent and proper.
570.34(a) to be performed in additional industries, rather than just in retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments.
just like in 1960 when ho 14 was first issued, the department is receiving reports of injuries and deaths, such as the ones described in the preceding paragraphs, of youth operating power-driven machines that may be prohibited when used to process certain types of materials and not prohibited when processing other types of materials.
reciprocating saw shall mean a machine equipped with a moving blade that alternately changes direction on a linear cutting axis used for sawing materials.
both the report and the department's enforcement experience reflect that meat slicers are responsible for many occupational injuries.
the department has also replaced the words firefighting and firelines in the final rule with the words fire fighting and fire lines.
the department submitted the information collections contained in sec.
the department, for this very reason, did not specifically identify the cristo rey network in the nprm.
the department believes that implementation of the final rule would not reduce the overall number of safe, positive, and legal employment opportunities available to young workers.
in these situations, the department has determined that it is not necessary for every employer (tenant) that wishes to take advantage of the loading exemption to post a notice on
the department notes that the niosh report, after carefully reviewing the available data, did not include youth peddling as one of the 17 occupations warranting the creation of a new hazardous occupations order (ho).
during the remaining week of the four-week cycle, such minor is permitted to work during school hours on no more than two days, and for no more than for eight hours on each of those two days.
the clc supported this proposal but again expressed concern based on its erroneous assumption that such youth could be employed to paint automobiles.
for similar reasons, the department did not identify the municipalities that inquired about the employment of youth by state and local governments and as lifeguards, which led to the department's enforcement positions on those topics.
the department appreciates the concerns of the ywn, clc, and usla about lowering the employment age for lifeguards at traditional swimming pools and certain water amusement park facilities to 15, but believes that such safeguards as proper certification in aquatics and water safety by a recognized certification organization, the prohibition against tending power-driven machinery which prevents 15- year-olds from working as dispatchers or attendants at the top of elevated water slides, the osha standards addressing potential exposures to bloodborne pathogens and chemicals, and the hours and times of day standards established by sec.
------------------------------------------------------------------------ (2) the notice shall completely identify the appropriate ansi standard.
lack of experience in the work place and in assessing risks, and developmental factors--physical, cognitive, and psychological--all contribute to the higher rates of occupational injuries and deaths experienced by young workers.
this rule is not subject to e.o. 13045 because it is not economically significant as defined in e.o. 12866.
one such condition is that the vehicle be equipped with a seat belt for the driver and any passengers and that the young driver's employer has instructed the youth that the seat belts must be used when driving the vehicle.
the department also wishes to assure both the ywn and clc that employers participating in the work-study program authorized by sec.

the department has also moved the definition of portable sawmill contained within sec. 570.54(a)(2) (old) to the definitions section (sec. 570.54(b) (new)).
permitted duties for 15-year-olds would include the use of a ladder to access and descend from the lifeguard chair; the use of hand tools to clean the pool and pool area; and the testing and recording of water quality for temperature and/or ph levels, using all of the tools of the testing process including adding chemicals to the test water sample.
this exemption, as detailed in the compactor and baler act, would apply only to certain scrap paper balers and paper box compactors, as currently defined in sec. 570.63(b).
the department has interpreted the reg. 3 prohibition regarding service as helpers on a motor vehicle to preclude youth under the age of 16 from riding anywhere outside the passenger compartment of the motor vehicle.
the facilities manager or owner, or the owner of the equipment, may make the necessary postings and satisfy each employer's (tenant's) posting obligations under the exemption.
because these ansi standards are copyright-protected, the department cannot include them in the regulations or reproduce them for distribution to the public.
finally, they may work in timber cruising, surveying, or logging engineering parties; in the repair or maintenance of roads, railroads, or flumes; and in forest protection, such as clearing fire trails or roads, piling and burning slash, maintaining fire-fighting equipment, constructing and maintaining telephone lines, or acting as fire lookouts or fire patrolman away from the actual logging operations--but only if such tasks do not involve the felling or bucking of timber, the collecting or transporting of logs, the operation of power-driven machinery, the handling or use of explosives, and working on trestles.
the journal noted that the victim had been drinking beer while trimming the branches.
this is also true for poultry processing which is not encompassed in the existing ho.
he stated ``such a rule would cripple career technical education (cte) programs that have work-based learning opportunities embedded within the curriculum.''
(5) employment of homeworkers engaged in the making of evergreen wreaths, including the harvesting of the evergreens or other forest products used in making such wreaths.
for example, the department has encountered a situation involving the employment of very young females as ``taxi-dancers'' who were recruited and paid by bars and nightclubs to dance with male patrons, often late into the evening.
the youth was electrocuted shortly after midnight when he bumped into a fan while performing his ``catching'' duties.
not included in the definition of a traditional swimming pool would be such natural environment swimming facilities as rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, quarries, reservoirs, wharfs, piers, canals, or oceanside beaches.

although section 13(c)(7) permits the employment of certain youth inside and outside of places of business where machinery is used to process wood products, it does so only if the youth do not operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines.
* * (4) all occupations involved in the operation or feeding of the following power-driven machines, including setting-up, adjusting, repairing, or oiling such machines or the cleaning of such machines or the individual parts or attachments of such machines, regardless of the product being processed by these machines (including, for example, the slicing in a retail delicatessen of meat, poultry, seafood, bread, vegetables, or cheese, etc.): meat patty forming machines, meat and bone [[page 28456]] cutting saws, poultry scissors or shears; meat slicers, knives (except bacon-slicing machines), headsplitters, and guillotine cutters; snoutpullers and jawpullers; skinning machines; horizontal rotary washing machines; casing-cleaning machines such as crushing, stripping, and finishing machines; grinding, mixing, chopping, and hashing machines; and presses (except belly-rolling machines).
though cognizant of the limitations of the report, the department places great value on the information and analysis provided by niosh.
the previous sec. 570.54(a)(1)(iii) specifically excluded from the list of logging tasks deemed to be particularly hazardous to young workers who work in timber cruising, surveying or logging-engineering parties; work in the repair or maintenance of roads, railroads, or flumes; and work in forest protection, such as clearing fire trails or roads, piling and burning slash, maintaining fire-fighting equipment, constructing and maintaining telephone lines, or acting as fire look-out or fire patrolman away from the actual logging operation.
the report shows that a substantial number of deaths and injuries are associated with operating and assisting in tasks performed by power-driven hoisting apparatus, including deaths of youth (see niosh report, page 36).
unfunded mandates reform act for purposes of the unfunded mandates reform act of 1995, 2 u.s.c. 1532, this rule does not include any federal mandate that may result in excess of $100 million in expenditures by state, local and tribal governments in the aggregate or by the private sector.
the forest service also noted that it ``currently uses 16- and 17-year-old job corps employees and private contractors in our fire camps to perform such tasks as building platforms for tents, stocking commissary items, performing timekeeping activities and providing food services.''
consistent with its enforcement position, the department exercised its prosecutorial discretion, as authorized by 29 u.s.c. 216(e), and declined to cite reg. 3 occupations violations for the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds by state and local governments as long as that employment fell within the occupations authorized by reg. 3 (sec. 570.34(a) (old)) and did not involve any of the tasks or occupations prohibited by reg. 3 (sec.
in fact, depending upon the facts of each situation and the degree of control the school exercises over the employment of the participating student, it is possible that the student would be considered to be jointly employed by the host- employer and the youth's school under the flsa (see 29 cfr part 791).
the sic industry group of forestry services encompasses establishments primarily engaged in performing, on a contract or fee basis, services related to timber production, wood technology, forestry economics and marketing, as well as other forestry services not contained in another sic such as timber cruising, forest fire fighting, and reforestation.
as niosh stated, ``[t]his relatively small difference in rates is cause for concern because youth under age 18 are employed less frequently in especially hazardous jobs.''
this enforcement position permitted such employment at swimming pools operated by hotels, amusement parks, cities, and state- owned universities, but did not permit such employment at pools operated by non-public and non-retail establishments such as apartment houses, country clubs, private schools, home-owner associations, and private health clubs.
the employment of such minors would still be governed by the remaining provisions of reg. 3, including the daily, weekly, morning, and evening hours standards limitations contained in sec.
a representative of six flags, inc. also supported the proposal and stated that ``[w]hile we still believe that 15-year-olds could safely work as dispatchers on elevated water elements, we find the proposed changes to be an acceptable compromise.''
operator shall mean a person who operates a machine covered by this section by performing such functions as starting or stopping the machine, placing materials into or removing them from the machine, or any other functions directly involved in operation of the machine.
hide cellar includes a workroom or workplace where hides are graded, trimmed, salted, and otherwise cured.
any administrative determination by the secretary of the amount of any penalty under section 216(e) of the flsa shall be final, unless within 15 days after receipt of notice thereof by certified mail the person charged with the violation takes exception to the determination that the violations for which the penalty is imposed occurred, in which event final determination of the penalty shall be made in an administrative proceeding after opportunity for hearing in accordance with section 554 of title 5, united states code, and regulations to be promulgated by the secretary.
that penalty may be doubled, up to $100,000, when such violation is determined by the department to be a repeated or willful violation.
most recently, the department investigated the death of a 16-year-old grocery store worker in new york who was crushed to death by a baler that had been jerry-rigged to operate while the door to the loading chamber was open.
as an outgrowth of this proposal, it stated that ``it would make sense either for the wage and hour division to enforce osha in this context by issuing osha citations that assert osha violations, or for the wage and hour division investigator to notify osha of an osha violation and direct osha to investigate the matter as well for osha violations.
in addition, such youth have been permitted to be employed, and have been safely employed, as janitors at many retail and food service establishments over the years, including department stores, hotels, amusement parks, restaurants, and large discount stores.
the department also proposed to reformat, in an alphabetical sequence, all the definitions found in sec. 570.61(b) to comport with guidance provided by the federal register.
this legislation amended the flsa by adding subsection 13(c)(5), which permits 16- and 17-year-olds to load, but not operate or unload, certain scrap paper balers and paper box compactors only when certain conditions are met.
[[page 28455]] to the potential hazard of such wood particles or flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient distance from machinery in operation; and (iv)
as supported by the provisions of the compactor and baler act, the final rule expanded the coverage of ho 12 to include those balers and paper box compactors that process other materials in addition to paper products.
this section shall not apply to the operation, including the setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling and cleaning, of lightweight, small capacity, portable counter-top power-driven food mixers that are, or are comparable to, models intended for household use.
570.34(l)(2) to reflect that 15-year-olds may be employed as swimming instructors only when they have been certified to perform both lifeguard and swimming instruction by the red cross or some other recognized certifying organization.
gina, among other things, amended flsa section 16(e) so that any person who violates the provisions of sections 12 or 13(c) of the flsa, relating to child labor, or any regulation issued pursuant to such sections, shall be subject to a civil money penalty not to exceed $11,000 for each employee who was the subject of such a violation.
accordingly, the department proposed to amend the definition of power- driven woodworking machines to include those machines that process trees, logs, and lumber.
the fmi commented that most of its members already have systems in place based on their own workweeks that automatically check hours worked to make sure minors do not exceed their allowable hours.
the determination of the amount of any civil money penalty becomes final if no exception is taken to the administrative assessment thereof, or if no exception is filed to the decision and order of the administrative law judge.
the department does not agree with the clc's comment that the dol gives no indication of what red cross training requires and the ywn's comment that this proposal is not ``tied to standards in the industry.''
the department has revised the regulatory language proposed in the nprm for ho 4 at sec. 570.54(a) to make it clear that the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to perform most jobs in timber tract, forestry service, and tree farm operations are prohibited.
this proposal, however, would not prevent a 16- or 17-year-old from operating a commercial dishwasher to run a self-contained rack containing parts of or attachments to a power-driven meat processing machine through the dishwasher so long as the youth does not actually handle or touch the machine parts or attachments.
therefore, no initial regulatory flexibility analysis was required.
the clc took issue with the department's statement that assisting in tasks being performed by the machines would constitute tending--an activity prohibited by the proposal.
guillotine shear shall mean a machine equipped with a moveable blade operated vertically and used to shear materials.
this enforcement position applies only when all the safeguards detailed above are present on the machine, are operational, and have not been overridden.
the occupations of operating or assisting in the operation of and the term power-driven woodworking machines are well-established in the regulations, including in sec.
as previously explained, any job not specifically permitted is prohibited.
the clc believed that such publicizing will remind all american youth, their parents, and their employers ``of the grave dangers that these machines represent to working children.''
the clc noted that many of these chemicals pose risks of both short-term and long-term effects on the human body and also are extremely flammable, and hence pose significant fire and explosion hazards.
specifically, the department believes school districts sponsoring a wsp will incur the greatest additional costs.
the report notes that there were 712 non-fatal injuries and illnesses in 1997, with a median of 11 days away from work, associated with work with mixers, blenders, and whippers (see niosh report, page 49).
(k) loading and unloading of goods or property onto or from motor vehicles, railroad cars, or conveyors, except the loading and unloading of personal non-power-driven hand tools, personal protective equipment, and personal items to and from motor vehicles as permitted by sec. 570.34(k).
the department's enforcement experience led it to incorporate into the regulations certain long-standing enforcement positions involving the definitions of remanufacturing departments of sawmills (ho 4), high- lift trucks (ho 7), and the cleaning of power-driven meat processing equipment (ho 10).
niosh reports on its web site (see http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/youth) that in 2007, an estimated 48,600 work-related injuries and illnesses among youth 15 to 17 years of age were treated in hospital emergency departments.
16- and 17-year-olds from operating or tending aerial platforms and other manlifts such as scissor lifts, boom-type mobile elevating work platforms, work assist vehicles, cherry pickers, basket hoists, and bucket trucks.
this proposal, however, would not prevent a 16- or 17-year-old from operating a commercial dishwasher to run a self-contained rack containing parts of or attachments to a power-driven meat processing machine through the dishwasher so long as the youth does not actually handle or touch the machine parts or attachments.
finally, the department is well aware of the importance of keeping all stakeholders informed of its compliance assistance initiatives and enforcement findings, and of serious occupational injuries involving youth.
the department also proposed, for the sake of brevity and clarity, not to repeat the list of individual hos as they are already listed in subpart e of 29 cfr part 570.
under this final rule, properly certified 15-year-olds could be employed at such pools as lifeguards.
jobs in such areas as state and local governments, banks, insurance companies, advertising agencies, and information technology firms all normally fall outside of the permitted establishments declared in reg. 3.
with regard to cooking and the use of kitchen equipment, the department notes that it implemented new rules concerning the types of cooking that may be performed by 14- and 15-year-olds in its final rule published in the federal register on december 16, 2004 (69 fr 75382).
lifeguards may also help to maintain order and cleanliness in the pool and pool areas, give swimming instructions (if, in addition to being certified as a lifeguard, the 15-year-old is also properly certified as a swimming instructor by the american red cross or some other recognized certifying organization), conduct or officiate at swimming meets, and administer first aid.
the usla commented that, since 1980, it has maintained the position that lifeguards serving at natural environments, whether surf or non-surf beaches, should be at least 16 years of age.
she also opined that such dispatchers are not in contact with any power-driven machinery.
the department also notes, as it has stated previously in this final rule, that its limited and public exercise of its prosecutorial discretion is an efficient and permissible tool available to the secretary in the administration of the child labor provisions of the flsa.
the department firmly believes that the limited and public exercise of its prosecutorial discretion is an efficient and legal tool available to the secretary in the administration of the child labor provisions of the flsa.
finally, as mentioned above, such youth should also be permitted to perform certain tasks related to forest fire fighting and [[page 28432]] forest fire prevention, when not performed in conjunction with the extinguishing of a fire, such as the clearing of trails or roads; the construction, maintenance, and patrolling of fire lines; acting as a fire lookout or fire patrolman; and tasks associated with the operation of a fire fighting base camp.
during the remaining week of the four-week cycle, such minor would be permitted to work during school hours on no more than two days, and for no more than eight hours on each of those two days.
examples of industries or activities included in sic 083 are the gathering of balsam needles, ginseng, huckleberry greens, maple sap, moss, spanish moss, sphagnum moss, teaberries, and tree seeds; the distillation of gum, turpentine, and rosin if carried on at the gum farm; and the extraction of pine gum.
she also addressed the position of water slide dispatcher, stating ``we see no reason or evidence that this is a dangerous job that should be restricted.''
[[page 28426]] meet the educational needs of people in many economically challenged areas throughout the country.
the department also believes that the certification process as proposed by the department, which again is similar to that required of wecep applicants, provides sufficient transparency without requiring publication in the federal register or public comment.
instead, these subsections state that the minors are permitted to ``clean kitchen equipment (not otherwise prohibited), remove oil or grease, pour oil or grease through filters, and move receptacles containing hot grease or hot oil, but only when the equipment surfaces, containers, and liquids do not exceed a temperature of 100 [deg]f.''
the clc stated that it welcomes the change as this work is plainly too hazardous for 14- and 15-year-olds to perform.
tending such equipment includes assisting in the hoisting tasks being performed by the equipment.
(c) employment of minors enrolled in a program approved pursuant to the requirements of this section shall be confined to not more than 18 hours in any one week when school is in session, a portion of which may be during school hours, in accordance with the following formula that is based upon a continuous four-week cycle.
the exemption contained in sec. 570.58(a)(1) permitting youth to operate and ride inside passenger elevators would be retained, but the exemption that currently allows 16- and 17-year-olds to operate an electric or air-operated hoist not exceeding one ton capacity would be eliminated as per the report recommendation.
the occupations of operating or assisting in the operation of and the term power-driven woodworking machines are well-established in the regulations, including in sec.
paper box compactor means a powered machine that remains stationary during operation, used to compact refuse, including paper boxes, into a detachable or integral container or into a transfer vehicle.
the limited exemption provided by flsa section 13(c)(5) and contained in sec. 570.63(c)(1), which allows 16- and 17-year-old workers, under specific conditions, to load but not operate or unload certain scrap paper balers and paper box compactors, would remain.
even if nada had presented data supporting its statement that power-equipment-assisted motor vehicle washing and polishing poses ``no significant safety or health risks to 14- and 15-year-olds,'' the department notes that such a standard is considerably more lax than the flsa section 3(l) standard the secretary must apply when determining permissible employment opportunities for such youth.
[[page 28436]] report's recommendation to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to operate and feed power-driven meat and food slicers in retail, wholesale and service industry establishments.
for such employment to comply with reg. 3, the employee would have to be at least 15 years of age and be properly certified.
, she noted that her facility has ``swim instructors who are certified by the american red cross as water safety instructors, but are not lifeguard certified.''
for example, clerical work, cashiering, and clean-up work are authorized, whereas ``all work requiring the use of ladders, scaffolds, or their substitutes'' is prohibited.
each school participating in a work- study program shall designate a teacher-coordinator under whose supervision the program will operate.
the clc noted that although the proposed sec. 570.34(b) contains the statement that artistically creative work is limited to work in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor, it does not define the term artistic or creative endeavor.
because sign wavers and those hired to wave or hold up other products, or wear placards, sandwich boards, or costumes to attract potential customers are exposed to many of the same dangers associated with youth peddling, the following sentence has been added to sec.
all occupations in forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention, in timber tracts, in forestry services, logging, and the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage stock mill are particularly hazardous for the employment of minors between 16 and 18 years of age, except the following when not prohibited by any other section of this subpart: (1) work in offices or in repair or maintenance shops.
tty/tdd callers may dial toll-free (877) 889-5627 to obtain information or request materials in alternative formats.
the department notes that, because the flsa does not cover individuals who volunteer to perform services for state or local government agencies when the provisions in section 3(e)(4) are met, this proposal would not prohibit 16- and 17-year-old volunteers from donating their forest fire fighting services to state and local governments.
under ho 7, 16- and 17-year-olds may currently perform such work, except they may not assist in the operation of a crane, derrick, or hoist as defined by the ho.
the department, when issuing the 2004 final rule, noted that there still remained one class of balers and compactors that falls outside of the scope of ho 12--those machines that are designed or used exclusively to process materials other than paper.
lifeguards may also help to maintain order and cleanliness in the pool and pool areas, give swimming instructions, conduct or officiate at swimming meets, and administer first aid.
the exemption, contained at section 13(c)(7) of the flsa, overrides the ho 4 prohibition against 16- and 17-year-olds performing any work in the sawmill industry that entails entering the sawmill building by permitting certain youth to be employed inside and outside of places of business where machinery is used to process wood products.
the child labor provisions of the flsa permit 16- and 17- year-olds to work in the nonagricultural sector without hours or time limitations, except in certain occupations found and declared by the secretary to be particularly hazardous or detrimental to the health or well-being of such workers.
(j) cleaning vegetables and fruits, and the wrapping, sealing, labeling, weighing, pricing, and stocking of items, including vegetables, fruits, and meats, when performed in areas physically separate from a freezer or meat cooler.
the usla noted that the participants at this conference, which used a consensus-based process to issue its recommendations, considered such factors as the physical and cultural parameters of the natural environments to be guarded; the psychological and physiological stresses of public safety employment; the lack of physical stamina, maturity, and experience of those under 16 years of age; and the varying levels of supervision provided young lifeguards.
over sixty percent of that number, 7,280 injuries and illnesses, were caused by food slicers.
570.34(a)(8) (old) by clarifying that 14- and 15-year-olds may perform car cleaning, washing, and polishing, but only by hand (see sec. 570.34(n) (new)).
in addition, such minors would be permitted to load onto and unload from motor vehicles any personal protective equipment they themselves will use at the work site and any personal items such as backpacks, lunch boxes, and coats their employers allow them to take to the work site.
the whd occasionally receives requests for clarification from employers seeking to lengthen the work shifts of younger employees on nights that do not precede a school day.
properly certified 15-year-old lifeguards, however, may be stationed at the ``splashdown pools'' located at the bottom of the elevated water slides to perform traditional lifeguard duties.
accordingly, 14- and 15-year-olds generally have been prohibited from loading and unloading any property (not just ``goods'') onto and from motor vehicles, including the light personal hand tools they use in performing their duties.
written participation agreement: the school system administering the wsp and each applicable employer shall separately maintain a copy of the written participation agreement for each student.
``a hoisted load weighing less than one ton has the potential to cause injury or death as a result of falling, or being improperly rigged or handled.
scrap paper baler means a powered machine used to compress paper and possibly other solid waste, with or without binding, to a density or form that will support handling and transportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable container.
3 dealing with power-driven machinery into a single, new subsection located at sec. 570.33(e) and to expand the list of prohibited machinery, with certain caveats.
it also commented that it found it difficult to construct reasons that differentiate the natural environment from the pool environment, given that many of the reasons for establishing a minimum age of 16 years for employment as a lifeguard at a natural environment facility are equally applicable at traditional pools.
the term compensation would not include the small prizes, trophies, or other awards of minimal value that the eleemosynary organization may give a volunteer in recognition of his or her fund raising efforts.
the department received an inquiry after the publication of the nprm asking why ponds and quarries, places where swimming often occurs, were not specifically listed as natural environment swimming facilities in sec.
the consolidated appropriations act, 2004, public law 108-199, sec. 108, which was signed into law on january 23, 2004, amended the flsa by creating a limited exemption from the child labor provisions for minors 14 to 18 years of age who are excused from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade.
in 1999, the department investigated the death of a young poultry processing worker in arkansas and the serious injury of a similarly employed minor in missouri who injured both of his legs when he slipped and fell into an auger.
570.37 (new), the participating school district and employers share the burden of ensuring that the employment of work- study program participants is in compliance with the flsa.
* * * (7) all occupations involving the handlifting or handcarrying any carcass or half carcass of beef, pork, horse, deer, or buffalo, or any quarter carcass of beef, horse, or buffalo.
570.34 occupations that may be performed by minors 14 and 15 years of age.
the exemption, contained in section 13(c)(7) of the flsa, allows eligible youth, under specific conditions, to be employed inside and outside of places of business that use machinery to process wood products, but does not allow such youth to operate or assist in operating power-driven woodworking machines.
the clc is correct in its interpretation that 14- and 15-year-olds are permitted under sec. 570.34(a)(4) (old) and sec. 570.34(g) (new) to perform errand and delivery work by foot, bicycle, and public transportation for their employers when their employers are not engaged in the business of providing messenger services to others.
in addition, these standards are available for inspection at the national archives and records administration (nara).
the employment of 15-year-olds (but not 14-year- olds) to perform permitted lifeguard duties at traditional swimming pools and water amusement parks (including such water park facilities as wave pools, lazy rivers, specialized activity areas that may include water falls and sprinkler areas, and baby pools; but not including the elevated areas of power-driven water slides) when such youth have been trained and certified by the american red cross, or a similar certifying organization, in aquatics and water safety.
the department's proposed wsp, unlike the cristo rey model, requires annual classroom instruction in workplace safety and state and federal child labor provisions and rules (see sec. 570.37(b)(3)(ii)), the oversight of a designated teacher-coordinator required to make visits to the students' workplaces (see sec. 570.37(b)(3)(iii)), the completion of a detailed written participation agreement (see sec. 570.37(b)(3)(iv)), and a rigorous certification process.
* * (4) all occupations involved in the operation or feeding of the following power-driven machines, including setting-up, adjusting, repairing, or oiling such machines or the cleaning of such machines or the individual parts or attachments of such machines, regardless of the product being processed by these machines (including, for example, the slicing in a retail delicatessen of meat, poultry, seafood, bread, vegetables, or cheese, etc.): meat patty forming machines, meat and bone
(i) work in freezers and meat coolers and all work in the preparation of meats for sale except as permitted by sec. 570.34(j).
sec. 570.33 occupations that are prohibited to minors 14 and 15 years of age.
they may work in the peeling of fence posts, pulpwood, chemical wood, excelsior wood, cordwood, or similar products when not done in conjunction with and at the same time and place as other logging occupations declared hazardous by ho 4.
also included would be ``public use'' waste receptacles--often found at airports and other large complexes--that include compaction equipment that allow the public to dispose of refuse and then automatically processed the waste at predetermined intervals.
the exception to this rule is where there is some discrete operation or division that could legitimately be characterized as such an establishment and therefore would be subject to these rules (e.g., minors employed in a food service operation at a city park or a publicly owned sports stadium).
(old and new), permitting 16- and 17-year-olds to be employed in certain sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage stock mill occupations.
this approach seems to us to give far more emphasis to work experiences for 14- and 15-year-olds than to their education.''
570.33 occupations that are prohibited to minors 14 and 15 years of age.
accordingly, the department has revised the regulatory language in sec. 570.54(a)(2).
such youth may not ride in the bed of a pick-up truck, on the running board of a van, or on the bumper of a refuse truck.
because the department believes that the health, well-being, and educational opportunities of 14- and 15-year-olds who are academically oriented are not placed at risk by participation in structured work- study programs such as the network's model--and are in fact enhanced by such participation--it proposed that reg. 3 be revised to accommodate such programs.
minors less than 16 years of age may not be employed as dispatchers or attendants at the top of elevated water slides-- employees who maintain order, direct patrons as to when to depart the top of the slide, and ensure that patrons have safely begun their ride--because such work constitutes ``tending'' as used in reg. 3.
in fact, ensuring that permissible job opportunities for working youth are safe, healthy, and not detrimental to their education, as required by the statute, produces many positive benefits in addition to fewer occupational injuries and deaths, including reduced health and productivity costs that employers may otherwise incur because of higher accident and injury rates to young and inexperienced workers.
working in the dark, with the only illumination provided by ``red lights'' which the fowl cannot see, and in poorly ventilated rooms, is not uncommon.
570.34 to only retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments.
a traditional swimming pool, as used in this subpart, would mean a water-tight structure of concrete, masonry, or other approved materials located either indoors or outdoors, used for bathing or swimming and filled with a filtered and disinfected water supply, together with buildings, appurtenances and equipment used in connection therewith.
water amusement park means an establishment that not only encompasses the features of a traditional swimming pool, but may also include such additional attractions as wave pools; lazy rivers; specialized activities areas such as baby pools, water falls, and sprinklers; and elevated water slides.
even though, under this rule, 14- and 15-year-olds may only occasionally enter freezers momentarily to retrieve items (see sec. 570.33(i)
the department's proposed wsp, unlike the cristo rey model, requires annual classroom instruction in workplace safety and state and federal child labor provisions and rules (see sec. 570.37(b)(3)(ii)), the oversight of a designated teacher-coordinator required to make visits to the students' workplaces (see sec. 570.37(b)(3)(iii)), the completion of a detailed written participation agreement (see sec. 570.37(b)(3)(iv)), and a rigorous certification process.
the council stated ``[t]he niosh recommendation appears well-supported'' while the fmi believed the department's position to be ``surprising as the niosh recommendations are based on the hard data and analysis that dol asked niosh to provide.''
flsa section 3(l) establishes a minimum age of 16 years for most nonagricultural employment but allows the employment of 14- and 15- year-olds in occupations other than manufacturing and mining, if the secretary of labor determines such employment is confined to periods that will not interfere with the minor's schooling and conditions that will not interfere with the minor's health and well-being.
congressional hearings and the department's enforcement experience have shown that the problems associated with children performing door- to-door sales and street sales are numerous.
the fmi commented that most of its members already have systems in place based on their own workweeks that automatically check hours worked to make sure minors do not exceed their allowable hours.
the ho prohibits, with certain exceptions discussed below, the loading, operating, and unloading of scrap paper balers, including paper box balers and compacting machines, and other power-driven machines used in the remanufacture or conversion of paper or pulp into a finished product.
the department has previously opined that espresso makers and cappuccino makers are types of automatic coffee machines and
gina, among other things, amended flsa section 16(e) to provide that any person who violates the provisions of sections 12 or 13(c) of the flsa, relating to child labor, or any regulation issued pursuant to such sections, shall be subject to a civil money penalty not to exceed $11,000 for each employee who was the subject of such a violation.
acting as a fire lookout or fire patrolman; and the piling and burning of slash.
employment that is not specifically permitted is prohibited.
while the department appreciates the remaining safety-affecting recommendations made by the ywn, clc, and dolwd, it believes the provisions of the original proposal, when coupled with other existing state and federal provisions dealing with the safe operation of motor vehicles, will provide ample protections to young workers.
congress also provided the secretary of labor with flexibility when administering flsa section 13(c)(5) by allowing balers and compactors to meet any additional standards adopted by ansi if certified by the secretary to be at least as protective of the safety of minors as the standards contained in the compactor and baler act.
570.35, does not interfere with their schooling or with their health and well-being and shall not be deemed to be oppressive child labor.
the department agreed with the niosh report recommendation that ho 4 should be expanded to cover work in forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention because of the risks inherent in those occupations.
home-schooled youth would be able to participate in work-study programs operated by local public schools in the same manner many currently participate in team sports programs, band, and other extracurricular activities.
(ix) manual loading of bundles of shingles or shakes into trucks or railroad cars, provided that the employer has on file a statement from a licensed doctor of medicine or osteopathy certifying the [[page 28454]] minor capable of performing this work without injury to himself, except minors under 16 years of age may not load bundles of shingles or shakes into trucks or railroad cars as they are prohibited from loading and unloading goods or property onto or from motor vehicles, railroad cars, or conveyors by sec. 570.33(k) of this part.
the city advised the department that, even with the adoption of the enforcement position that permits state and local governments to employ minors under certain conditions, it was being forced to abandon a youth-employment program that provided 14- and 15-year-olds with certain jobs because of the prohibition against loading materials into vehicles.
this rule is not subject to e.o. 13045 because it is not economically significant as defined in e.o. 12866.
the term shall not include work performed in the planing-mill department or other remanufacturing departments of any sawmill or remanufacturing plant not a part of a sawmill.
570.35 combine to provide adequate protections to these young workers.
in certain situations, such as at shopping malls, industrial parks, office buildings, or military bases, multiple employers may have access to and use ``community'' balers and compactors that the facilities manager or owner has made available to the tenants or contractors.
the work of assisting in the operation of a crane, derrick, or hoist would be prohibited because such tasks fall within the scope of tending of equipment.
the effect of these orders is to raise the minimum age for employment to 18 years in the occupations covered.
a water amusement park means an establishment that not only encompasses the features of a traditional swimming pool, but may also include such additional attractions as wave pools; lazy rivers; specialized activities areas such as baby pools, water falls, and sprinklers; and elevated water slides.
the ho was created because of the extremely high numbers of occupational fatalities and injuries that were experienced by workers of all ages in these industries.
such minors would not be permitted to load or unload safety equipment such as barriers, cones, or signage.
in fact, employment opportunities for 14- and 15-year-olds would increase with creation, for example, of a limited exemption for certain work-study programs, allowing youth to be employed in work of an intellectual or creative nature, and allowing youth to be employed in those permitted occupations listed in sec.
because very little substantive information was received, the department withdrew the anprm on february 24, 2010.
under sec. 570.33(j) as originally proposed, a retail establishment that sets up an outside sales center to sell such things as garden supplies, plants, outdoor furniture, portable grills, christmas trees, etc., that participates in a retailer association neighborhood ``sidewalk sale'' event, or that routinely displays its wares outside its building may question whether it could use its young sales staff in such endeavors.
the youth is protected from wood particles or other flying debris within the workplace by a barrier appropriate to the potential hazard of such wood
[[page 28406]] data available, addressed 25 of the remaining 29 niosh report recommendations dealing with the existing nonagricultural hazardous occupations orders.
the department is aware of the death of an adult plumber in minnesota in 2002 who was killed when the blade of the reciprocating saw he was using to rough-in plumbing entered his head near his eye.
the fmi reported that its retail membership is composed of large multi-store chains, regional firms and independent supermarkets.
for similar reasons, the department did not identify the municipalities that inquired about the employment of youth by state and local governments and as lifeguards, which led to the department's enforcement positions on those topics.
the niosh report did not mention the provisions of sec. 570.34(a)(8) because the report dealt exclusively with hos, which address work that is particularly hazardous or detrimental to the health and well-being of 16- and 17-year-old minors.
it also prohibits the occupations of off-bearing from circular saws and from guillotine-action veneer clippers.
the department is aware that, given the flsa's mandate that before 14- or 15-year-olds may legally be employed to perform any covered work, the secretary of labor must first determine that the work to be performed does not constitute oppressive child labor, it could choose to publish only a list of permissible occupations and industries, and not provide a list of certain commonly arising prohibited occupations and industries.
the public messenger goes between two parties, neither of whom is necessarily known to the messenger.
no comments were received that identified any tasks in these industries as being safe for minors to perform.
all occupations in forestry services shall mean all work involved in the support of timber production, wood technology, forestry economics and marketing, and forest protection.
an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid omb control number (see 5 cfr 1320.6).
injuries, and even deaths, have occurred as the result of young children engaging in youth peddling activities.
first, the department has been persuaded by the comments of the forest service and the dolwd that 16- and 17-year-olds can safely be employed in certain capacities in forest protection and in the operation of fire fighting base camps.
the concentration or distillation of these products, when carried out in the forest, is also included [[page 28430]] in this industry.
(3) exceptions from certain of the hours standards contained in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(3) of this section are provided for the employment of minors who are enrolled in and employed pursuant to a school-supervised work-experience and career exploration program as detailed in sec.
the clc stated that it ``welcomes'' the proposed inclusion of chain saws, wood chippers, and reciprocating saws but also ``sees no reason for dol's failure to include abrasive cutting discs as well.''
employment of certain youth inside and outside of places of business that use power-driven machinery to process wood products.
a representative of morey's pier of wildwood, new jersey, whose comments were submitted by the iaapa, supported the proposal to allow the employment of 15-year-olds as lifeguards at traditional swimming pools and water amusement parks.
the loading onto motor vehicles and the unloading from motor vehicles of the light, non-power-driven, hand tools and personal protective equipment that the minor will use as part of his or her employment at the work site; and the loading onto motor vehicles and the unloading from motor vehicles of personal items such as a back pack, a lunch box, or a coat that the minor is permitted to take to the work site.
if fatalities result from recognized illegal activities, such as working with fireworks or a power-driven circular saw, the best strategy for preventing future injuries may not be to revise the regulations but to increase compliance with existing laws through public awareness initiatives, targeted compliance assistance efforts, and stepped-up enforcement activities.
for example, the department has encountered a situation involving the employment of very young females as ``taxi-dancers'' who were recruited and paid by bars and nightclubs to dance with male patrons, often late into the evening.
570.62(b)(2) would apply only when all the safeguards detailed above are present on the machines, are operational, and have not been overridden.
prohibited machines include those indoor- types of power-driven trash compactors equipped with built-in carts that detach from the compactor to facilitate disposal of the compacted waste.
in addition, the student's parent or guardian shall either sign or otherwise provide consent for the participation agreement to be valid.
as used in this paragraph (l): permitted lifeguard duties include the rescuing of swimmers in danger of drowning, the monitoring of activities at poolside to prevent accidents, the teaching of water safety, and providing assistance to patrons.
the department believes that before any changes to the existing exemptions are made, it is important to first consider and develop criteria for determining when apprenticeship and student-learners exemptions are appropriate.
in that regard, the department is nearing completion of its thorough review of the niosh recommendations that address the agricultural hazardous occupations orders.
section 13(c)(7) allows the employment of certain 14- and 15-year-olds inside and outside of places of business that use power-driven machinery to process wood products as discussed above.
the department proposed to amend the definition of power-driven woodworking machines to include those machines that process trees, logs, and lumber in recognition that section 13(c)(7) now permits certain youth 14 through 17 years of age to work in such places of business as sawmills, lath mills, and shingle mills where trees, logs, and lumber would be processed.
such youth may work up to 23 hours in any one week when school is in session and not more than 3 hours in any day when school is in session, any portion of which may be during school hours.
accordingly, even if 15-year-old minors have been certified as lifeguards, the provisions of sec.
the teacher-coordinator shall generally supervise and coordinate the work and educational aspects of the program and make regularly scheduled visits to the workplaces of the participating students to confirm that minors participating in the work-study program are employed in compliance with all applicable provisions of this part and section 6 of the fair labor standards act.
these activities are normally performed in environments and under conditions that present risks of injury and illness to young workers.
three titanium plates were permanently implanted into the minor's skull.
the determination of the amount of any civil money penalty becomes final if no exception is taken to the administrative assessment thereof, or if no exception is filed to the decision and order of the administrative law judge.
each participating school would be required to name a teacher- coordinator to supervise the work-study program, make regularly scheduled visits to the students' work sites, and ensure that participants are employed in compliance with the minimum wage and child labor provisions of the flsa.
in the case of minors 14 and 15 years of age who are employed to perform sports-attending services at professional sporting events, i.e., baseball, basketball, football, soccer, tennis, etc., the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(6) of this section shall not apply, provided that the duties of the sports-attendant occupation consist of pre- and post-game or practice setup of balls, items and equipment; supplying and retrieving balls, items and equipment during a sporting event; clearing the field or court of debris, moisture, etc., during play; providing ice, drinks, towels, etc., to players during play; running errands for trainers, managers, coaches, and players before, during, and after a sporting event; and returning and/or storing balls, items and equipment in club house or locker room after a sporting event.
youth peddling does not include the activities of persons who, as volunteers and without compensation, sell goods or services on behalf of eleemosynary organizations or public agencies.
570.35 combine to provide adequate protections to these young workers.
the proposed prohibition concerning the employment of youth in forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention would apply to all forest locations and buildings located within the forest, not just where logging or sawmilling takes place.
the national council of chain restaurants (council), the representative of morey's pier, and the fmi supported defining the term school in session by following the academic schedule and attendance requirements of each minor, rather than that of the local public school.

and expand the list of examples of prohibited equipment to include power- driven trimmers, weed-eaters, edgers, golf carts, food processors, and food mixers.
the exemption also places limitations on the number of trips the 17-year-old may make each day and restricts the driving
for purposes of this exemption, the department proposed that a lightweight, small capacity mixer is one that is not hardwired into the establishment's power source, is equipped with a motor that operates at no more than \1/2\ horsepower, and whose bowl capacity does not exceed five quarts.
for example, the afl-cio noted that ``[w]orking in the forest industry can involve working at heights *
[[page 28412]] inventory and cleanup work, involving prolonged stays in freezers or meat coolers, are also prohibited.
the temperature of 100[deg] f, when presented in sec. 570.34(a)(7) (old) and sec. 570.34(i) (new), does not apply to the operation of kitchen equipment or to such permitted activities as cooking with certain grills or deep fryers.
the consolidated appropriations act, 2004, public law 108-199, sec. 108, which was signed into law on january 23, 2004, amended the flsa by creating a limited exemption from the child labor provisions for minors 14 to 18 years of age who are excused from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade.
the department agrees with the ywn that the word intellectual better comports with the intent of this proposal than the word mental.
scrap paper baler means a powered machine used to compress paper and possibly other solid waste, with or without binding, to a density or form that will support handling and transportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable container.
her facility has ``cashiers who are not lifeguard certified, but who help maintain order/cleanliness in the pool area (deck, locker rooms, crowd control during emergency, etc.).
civil penalties collected for violations of section 212 shall be deposited in the general fund of the treasury.
the clc noted that the niosh report recommended that ho 7 prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from employment that, among other things, included ``assisting in tasks being performed'' by the power-driven hoisting equipment.
in addition, as niosh was tasked with examining issues within the framework of the current hos only, the report did not consider the extent to which fatalities occur despite existing hos, occupational safety and health administration (osha) standards, or state laws prohibiting the activity.
however, such tasks are permitted only when not performed in conjunction with extinguishing a forest fire.
these standards are also available for inspection at the occupational safety and health administration's docket office, room n-2625, u.s. department of labor, 200 constitution avenue, nw., washington, dc 20210, or any of its regional offices.
under the proposed rule, no youth under 15 years of age, whether properly certified or not, could legally perform any portion of the lifeguard duties detailed above as part of his or her flsa covered employment.
similarly, witnesses stressed that early morning and late evening work hours, which interfered with sleep and often fostered exhaustion, were unhealthful for children and also diminished the time that children should have spent with the family (see in the matter of proposed regulation relating to the employment of minors between 14 and 16 years of age under the fair labor standards act, official report of the proceedings before the children's bureau, february 15, 1939, at 19, 21, 34, 82).
solicitor of labor means the solicitor, u.s. department of labor, and includes attorneys designated by the solicitor to perform functions of the solicitor under this part and part 780 of this chapter.
for example, clerical work, cashiering, and clean-up work are authorized, whereas ``all work requiring the use of ladders, scaffolds, or their substitutes'' is prohibited.
the report notes that investigations of baler-related incidents show that failure to maintain machinery in safe operating condition contributes to fatalities and serious injuries and that neither adult supervisors nor young workers may fully appreciate the risks posed by uncontrolled hazardous energy.
570.34(l)(2) to reflect that 15-year-olds may be employed as swimming instructors only when they have been certified to perform both lifeguard and swimming instruction by the red cross or some other recognized certifying organization.
570.33 (old), they are prohibited.
finally, the clc also questioned, as did the ywn, if the ``host employers'' or the cristo rey high school would be considered the actual employers of the youth under the flsa.
curing cellar includes a workroom or workplace which is primarily devoted to the preservation and flavoring of meat, including poultry, by curing materials.
loading of personal hand tools onto motor vehicles and riding on motor vehicles (sec.

570.62(b)(2) that will permit such youth to operate--but not set-up, adjust, repair, oil, or clean--those power- driven pizza-dough rollers that: (1) are constructed with safeguards contained in the basic design so as to prevent fingers, hands, or clothing from being caught in the in-running point of the rollers; (2) have gears that are completely enclosed; and (3) have microswitches that disengage the machinery if the backs or sides of the rollers are removed.
the department notes that, because the flsa does not cover individuals who volunteer to perform services for state or local government agencies when the provisions in section 3(e)(4) are met, this proposal would not prohibit 16- and 17-year-old volunteers from donating their forest fire fighting services to state and local governments.
(2) work in the construction, operation, repair, or maintenance of living and administrative quarters, including logging camps and fire fighting base camps.
in addition, when a school system files a letter of application to renew an existing work-study program, it will be required to note that the teacher-coordinator has confirmed that the employment of students in the work-study program has been in compliance with the child labor and minimum wage provisions of the flsa.
artistically creative work would be limited to work in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor.
the representative of white hat recommended that participants in programs similar to those of the charter schools he advises should be permitted to work up to five hours on a school day.
this is because historically such facilities, when open to the general public, have been considered to have a retail concept.
the report states: ``construction work has high risks for fatal and nonfatal injuries and should not be exempted in the construction of living or administrative quarters at logging sites or mills'' (see niosh report, page 27).
this new program does not in any way negate or preclude schools or employers from participating in other preexisting or future work-study programs, work experience and/or career exploration programs, internships, or apprenticeships that also comport with the provisions of the flsa (whether with the hours standards and time of day restrictions in sec. 570.35 or the special wecep rules in sec.
the prohibition would not depend on the material or materials being processed and would encompass the occupations of setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning such machines.
[[page 28406]] data available, addressed 25 of the remaining 29 niosh report recommendations dealing with the existing nonagricultural hazardous occupations orders.
``a hoisted load weighing less than one ton has the potential to cause injury or death as a result of falling, or being improperly rigged or handled.
the clc assumed that the youth-employer's establishment ``means inside or directly outside the establishment, but not away from the establishment, such as on a street corner or parking lot.
in addition, the pilot program reduced the number of jobs being occupied by student participants by requiring that four students share a single full-time position.
reg. 3 also incorporates by reference all of the prohibitions contained in the hazardous occupations orders (29 cfr 570.50-.68), which identify occupations that are ``particularly hazardous'' and, therefore, prohibited for 16- and 17-year-olds (e.g., occupations involved in the operation of power-driven metal forming, punching, and shearing machines, see sec. 570.33(e) (old) and sec. 570.33(b) (new)).
(2) any person who repeatedly or willfully violates section 206 or 207 of the flsa, relating to wages, shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $1,100 for each such violation.
as noted in the nprm, the department did not propose any revisions to those standards.
there are indications, as reported by state and local governments and reflected in whd enforcement findings, that when such youth are employed under the guidelines established by the enforcement position, that employment does not interfere with their schooling or with their health and well- being, and thus is in accordance with the directive of the flsa.
the department appreciates the report's recommendation to continue emphasizing enforcement of portions of the compactor and baler act requiring that balers and compactors conform to construction and operations standards that greatly reduce exposure to hazardous energy.
the department notes that when such programs do not involve an employer-employee relationship, they fall outside the provisions of the flsa.
repairing, servicing, or disassembling an elevator, crane, derrick, hoist, or high-lift truck, except operating or riding inside an unattended automatic operation passenger elevator.
currently, the work of repairing, servicing, disassembling, and tending the machines covered by ho 7 is prohibited to 14- and 15-year-olds under reg. 3 at sec. 570.33(b) (old) and sec.
such discs were mentioned in the niosh report as cutting equipment that falls outside the prohibitions of ho 14.
the forest service also noted that it ``currently uses 16- and 17-year-old job corps employees and private contractors in our fire camps to perform such tasks as building platforms for tents, stocking commissary items, performing timekeeping activities and providing food services.''
570.34(a)(8) (old) be replaced with the words motor vehicles so such youth may be permitted to wash additional types of motor vehicles such as suvs, station wagons, and vans.
the report notes that investigations of baler-related incidents show that failure to maintain machinery in safe operating condition contributes to fatalities and serious injuries and that neither adult supervisors nor young workers may fully appreciate the risks posed by uncontrolled hazardous energy (see niosh report, page 50).
such a reporting plan would allow an assessment as to whether the revision should be rescinded or further refined to best protect working youth (see niosh report, page 48).
as noted in the nprm, the department did not propose any revisions to those standards.
the fmi found it ``hard to understand why their work hours should be governed by a school system they have nothing to do with.''
the cup was then positioned on the machine so that the single spindle--with an aeration disk or disks mounted at the bottom--could blend the milk shake.
570.35 restrict the number of hours and times of day that 14- and 15-year-olds may be employed in any flsa-covered work, including artistic or creative endeavors.
570.33(c) (old), since at least the mid-1950s, has included the loading and unloading of materials from motor vehicles when the purpose of the operation of the vehicle is the transportation of such materials.
the exemption, contained in section 13(c)(7) of the flsa, allows eligible youth, under specific conditions, to be employed by businesses that use machinery to process wood products, but does not allow such youth to operate or assist in operating power-driven woodworking machines.
it reported that about one-third of those injuries were to the eye.
570.54 forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention occupations, timber tract occupations, forestry service occupations, logging occupations, and occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage stock mill (order 4).
prohibited activities associated with youth peddling not only include the attempt to make a sale or the actual consummation of a sale, but also the preparatory and concluding tasks normally performed by a youth peddler in conjunction with his or her sales such as the loading and unloading of vans or other motor vehicles, the stocking and restocking of sales kits and trays, the exchanging of cash and checks with the employer, and the transportation of minors to and from the various sales areas by the employer.
the secretary, in promulgating this final rule, hereby certifies that standard ansi z245.2-2004 and standard ansi z245.2-2008 are as protective of the safety of minors as standard ansi z245.2-1992 and that standard ansi z245.5-2004 and standard ansi z245.5-2008 are as protective of the safety of minors as standard ansi z245.5-1990.
the department is aware of the death of an adult plumber in minnesota in 2002 who was killed when the blade of the reciprocating saw he was using to rough-in plumbing entered his head near his eye.
guillotine shears are covered under hos 5, 8, 10 and 12 when used on wood, metal, meat, and paper products, respectively.
the youth was electrocuted shortly after midnight when he bumped into a fan while performing his ``catching'' duties.
the department believes that in order to ensure these youth receive the degree of protection from injury congress intended, the supervision of the minors must be close, direct, and uninterrupted.
the department enforced all the other provisions of reg. 3, including the restrictions on hours of work, with respect to the employment of such minors.
performing work in connection with the transportation of other persons or property does not have to be the primary reason for the trip for this prohibition to apply.
purpose and use: wsp application: under the regulations, a local school system shall file a letter of application requesting the administrator of the wage and hour division to approve a wsp that permits the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds under conditions that reg. 3 would otherwise prohibit.
therefore, this rule is not ``economically significant'' and no regulatory impact analysis has been prepared.
the department believes that in order to ensure these youth receive the degree of protection from injury congress intended, the supervision of the minors must be close, direct, and uninterrupted.
most of these blenders were free standing counter-top models while others were incorporated into other equipment such as milk dispensers.
the result was, as discussed earlier, that the compactor and baler act required that before 16- and 17-year-olds could load such equipment, the scrap paper baler had to meet standard ansi z245.5-1990 and the paper box compactor had to meet standard ansi z245.2-1992.
the department will add backhoes and front- end loaders to the examples of high-lift trucks contained in sec.
in addition, for purposes of this section, an employer's conduct shall be deemed knowing, among other situations, if the employer received advice from a responsible official of the wage and hour division to the effect that the conduct in question is not lawful.
even though reg. 3 for many years has prohibited the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds to operate any power-driven equipment other than office machines, the department routinely receives inquiries as to the status of these individual pieces of equipment under reg. 3.
the department notes that, since publishing the nprm, it has investigated the serious injuries of at least ten more young workers who operated or cleaned such equipment.
these standards are also available for inspection at the occupational safety and health administration's docket office, room n-2625, u.s. department of labor, 200 constitution avenue, nw., washington, dc 20210, or any of its regional offices.
it is important to note that this requirement of close, direct, and uninterrupted supervision, just like the requirement that youth not operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machinery, applies to the employment of 16- and 17-year- olds as well as 14- and 15-year-olds.
as per the provisions of sec. 570.61(a)(4), it would not matter if products other than meat--such as vegetables or cheese--were being processed.
(g) errand and delivery work by foot, bicycle, and public transportation.
at such a hearing, the employer or an attorney retained by the employer may present such witnesses, introduce such evidence and establish such facts as the employer believes will support the exception.
the department notes that the niosh report, after carefully reviewing the available data, did not include youth peddling as one of the 17 occupations warranting the creation of a new hazardous occupations order (ho).
accordingly, a 16-year minimum age is required for employment in such messenger services.
the previous sec. 570.54(a)(1)(iii) specifically excluded from the list of logging tasks deemed to be particularly hazardous to young workers who work in timber cruising, surveying or logging-engineering parties; work in the repair or maintenance of roads, railroads, or flumes; and work in forest protection, such as clearing fire trails or roads, piling and burning slash, maintaining fire-fighting equipment, constructing and maintaining telephone lines, or acting as fire look-out or fire patrolman away from the actual logging operation.
as used here, the terms youth peddling, door-to-door-sales, and street sales do not include legitimate fund-raising activities by eleemosynary organizations such as cookie sales conducted by the girl scouts of america or school fund-raising events where the [[page 28413]] students are truly volunteers and are not promised compensation for the sales they make.
the whd occasionally receives requests for clarification from employers seeking to lengthen the work shifts of younger employees on nights that do not precede a school day.
because youth peddlers typically qualify as outside sales employees under flsa section 13(a)(1), they are usually exempt from the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the flsa (see 29 cfr 541.500).
[[page 28455]] to the potential hazard of such wood particles or flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient distance from machinery in operation; and (iv)
the city specifically requested permission to allow such minors to load and unload, onto and from motor vehicles, the light, non-power-driven tools each youth would personally use as part of his or her employment.
(g) outside window washing that involves working from window sills, and all work requiring the use of ladders, scaffolds, or their substitutes.
that penalty may be doubled up to $100,000 if the violation is determined to be a repeated or willful violation.
it would not likely result in: (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of u.s.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.
a copy of the information collection request can be obtained at http:// www.reginfo.gov or by contacting the wage and hour division as shown in the for further information contact section of this preamble.
accordingly, a 16-year minimum age is required for employment in such messenger services.
therefore, the prohibitions of ho 11 include the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to operate even the smallest of counter-top vertical mixers.
because the department believes that the health, well-being, and educational opportunities of 14- and 15-year-olds who are academically oriented are not placed at risk by participation in structured work- study programs such as the network's model--and are in fact enhanced by such participation--it proposed that reg. 3 be revised to accommodate such programs.
the department did not propose to prohibit, and the final rule does not prohibit, 14- and 15-year-olds from operating espresso machines as recommend by the ywn, the afl-cio, and the representative of the billings, montana job service.
supervised means that the youth's on-the-job activities must be directed, monitored, overseen, and controlled by certain named adults.
(new), the laundering of clothes and other materials generally constitutes a ``processing occupation'' which is prohibited under sec.
also included would be ``public use'' waste receptacles--often found at airports and other large complexes--that include compaction equipment that allow the public to dispose of refuse and then automatically processed the waste at predetermined intervals.
reg. 3 limits the hours and times of day that such minors may work and identifies occupations that are either permitted or prohibited for such minors.
but the department believes that the overall predominance of their responsibility to perform the core life-saving duty of rescuing patrons who are in the water, which they have been properly trained and certified to perform, outweighs the minimum, isolated, and sporadic amount of tending such lifeguards may potentially be called upon to do when stationed at wave pools, lazy rivers, and splashdown pools.
the red cross, just like other nationally recognized certifying organizations, spends a great deal of time and effort formulating, refining, disseminating, and publicizing the elements and standards of its lifeguard certification program.
this difference is due to differences in how initial departmental efforts and rocis dealt with rounding issues.
the term shall not include work in forest nurseries, establishments primarily engaged in growing trees for purposes of reforestation.
``by requiring the use of a sunday to saturday midnight week, employers would be forced to check hours worked manually, making it more likely that mistakes would be made.''
in addition, such data for youth 16 and 17 years of age tend to be mixed with that of older workers whose employment is not subject to the child labor provisions of the flsa.
the facilities manager or owner, or the owner of the equipment, may make the necessary postings and satisfy each employer's (tenant's) posting obligations under the exemption.
it includes work on tree farms, except those tree farm establishments that meet the definition of agriculture contained in 29 u.s.c. 203(f).
section 13(c)(7) of the flsa provides a limited exemption from the child labor provisions for certain youths between the ages of 14 and 18 years who, by statute or judicial order, are excused from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade, that permits their employment inside and outside of places of business that use power- driven machinery to process wood products.
he also stated that limiting participation in the proposed work-study program to students enrolled in a college preparatory curriculum ``can also have the unintended consequence of denying extended work hours and compensation from those who need it the most, the undereducated.''
the department believes by adopting in reg. 3 the identical language contained in ho 2 (see sec. 570.52(b)), it not only provides a high degree of protection to young workers but also avoids potential confusion.
16- and 17-year-olds from operating or tending aerial platforms and other manlifts such as scissor lifts, boom-type mobile elevating work platforms, work assist vehicles, cherry pickers, basket hoists, and bucket trucks.
the dolwd also suggested that the federal regulations on the number of hours that 14- and 15-year-olds may work should be amended to be consistent with the more permissive standards established in alaska.
the use of such equipment would also be prohibited by ho 10 when the mixer or wand is equipped with knives, blades, or cutting tools designed for use on meat and poultry.
no student shall participate in the work-study program until there has been made a written agreement signed by the teacher-coordinator, the employer, and the student.
properly certified 15-year-old lifeguards, however, may be stationed at the ``splashdown pools'' located at the bottom of the elevated water slides to perform traditional lifeguard duties.
the employment of certain youth by places of business where machinery is used to process wood products the provisions of the consolidated appropriations act, 2004, amended the flsa by creating a limited exemption from the child labor provisions for certain minors 14 through 17 years of age who are excused from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade.
580.6 filed with the secretary an exception to the determination that the violation or violations for which the penalty is imposed occurred.
x. executive order 13045, protection of children e.o. 13045, dated april 23, 1997 (62 fr 19885), applies to any rule that (1) is determined to be ``economically significant'' as defined in e.o. 12866, and (2) concerns an environmental health or safety risk that the promulgating agency has reason to believe may have a disproportionate effect on children.
these smaller general- purpose machines operate in essentially the same manner as the larger machines and present similar risks of injury.
affecting the reg. 3 occupations standards and both hos 4 and 5, this statutory provision would be available to a very small number of minors and therefore is expected to have little or no economic impact.
pulling lumber from the dry chain, except minors under 16 years of age may not pull lumber from the dry chain as such youth are prohibited from operating or tending power-driven machinery by sec. 570.33(e) of this part.

accordingly, 14- and 15-year-olds generally have been prohibited from loading and unloading any property (not just ``goods'') onto and from motor vehicles, including the light personal hand tools they use in performing their duties.
accordingly, the department issued an anprm, in conjunction with and on the same day as the nprm, to solicit public comment on this important issue.
it should also be noted that section 13(d) of the flsa already provides an exemption from the act's minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions to any homeworker engaged in the making of wreaths composed principally of natural holly, pine, cedar, or other evergreens (including the harvesting of the evergreens or other forest products used in making such wreaths).
typically, a crew leader attempts to saturate a particular area with sales crews, make as many sales as possible, and then quickly move to a new location.
the fmi stated ``[w]e strongly object to this change, which would create an administrative nightmare, and see no reason for it.''
the ywn and the afl-cio recommended that 14- and 15-year-olds also be prohibited from using espresso makers because, as the ywn reported, these machines involve a potential for serious burns.
the revision would permit 15-year-olds, but not 14-year-olds, to be employed as lifeguards, performing lifeguard duties, at traditional swimming pools and certain areas of amusement water parks operated by all types of employers, if the minors have been trained and certified by the red cross or a similarly recognized certifying organization.
these exemptions, which do not apply to work performed in a portable sawmill or that entails the young worker entering the sawmill building, permit 16- and 17-year-olds employed in occupations in the operation of sawmills, lath mills, shingle mills, or cooperage stock mills to work in offices or in repair or maintenance shops; to straighten, mark, or tally lumber on the dry chain or the dry drop sorter; pull lumber from the dry chain; to clean up the lumberyard; to pile, handle, or ship cooperage stock in yards or storage sheds other than operating of or assisting in the operation of power-driven equipment; to perform clerical work in the yards or shipping sheds, such as done by ordermen, tally-men, and shipping clerks; to perform clean-up work outside shake and shingle mills, except when the mill is in operation; to split shakes manually from precut and split blocks with a froe and mallet, except inside the mill building or cover; to pack shakes into bundles when done in conjunction with splitting shakes manually with a froe and mallet, except inside the mill building or cover; and to manually load bundles of shingles or shakes into trucks or railroad cars, provided that the employer has on file a statement from a licensed doctor of medicine or osteopathy certifying the minor capable of performing this work without injury to himself.
570.55 occupations involved in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines (order 5).
working in the dark, with the only illumination provided by ``red lights'' which the fowl cannot see, and in poorly ventilated rooms, is not uncommon.
this enforcement position permitted such employment at swimming pools operated by hotels, amusement parks, cities, and state- owned universities, but did not permit such employment at pools operated by non-public and non-retail establishments such as apartment houses, country clubs, private schools, home-owner associations, and private health clubs.
the clc commented that ``[w]orking in the forestry industry can involve working at heights *
performing work in connection with the transportation of other persons or property does not have to be the primary reason for the trip for this prohibition to apply.
the director of the labor standards and safety division of the alaska state department of labor and workforce [[page 28409]] development (dolwd) also supported the consolidation and listing of prohibited equipment with some exceptions.
baler that is designed or used to process materials other than paper means a powered machine designed or used to compress materials other than paper and cardboard boxes, with or without binding, to a density or form that will support handling and transportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable container.
with respect to employment in occupations other than manufacturing and mining and in accordance with the provisions of flsa section 13(c)(7), the secretary is authorized to issue regulations or orders lowering the age minimum to 14 years where he or she finds that such employment is confined to periods that will not interfere with the minors' schooling and to conditions that will not interfere with their health and well-being.
the department notes that the exemption from minimum wage and overtime contained in section 13(a)(1) for outside salespeople does not apply to individuals employed solely to wave signs or wear placards, sandwich boards, or costumes to attract potential customers as such promotion work is not performed in conjunction with sales actually made by those individuals (see sec. 541.503).
in 2000, the department investigated the death of a 14-year- old member of a tree-trimming crew who was dismembered when he became entangled in branches he was feeding into a drum-type wood chipper.
flsa section 3(l) establishes a minimum age of 16 years for most nonagricultural employment but allows the employment of 14- and 15- year-olds in occupations other than manufacturing and mining, if the secretary of labor determines such employment is confined to periods that will not interfere with the minor's schooling and conditions that will not interfere with the minor's health and well-being.
the secretary, in order to provide clarity and assist employers in attaining compliance, has listed in sec.
the students receive at least the applicable federal and state minimum wages, and applicable taxes are withheld and reported by their respective employers.
``for example, 14- and 15-year-olds would be permitted to work on a pottery wheel, but would be prohibited from applying certain glazes and would be prohibited from any work on or around the high heats of a pottery kiln.
the youth must also be protected from wood particles or other flying debris within the workplace by a barrier appropriate to the potential hazard of such wood particles or flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient distance from machinery in operation.
the department has added language to sec. 570.54(a) to make it clear that the limited exceptions to ho 4 listed in that paragraph do not include any work that would be prohibited by any other ho contained in subpart e. the department also added clarifying statements to sec. 570.54(a)(8) regarding the types of work that 14-year-olds employed under the provisions of flsa section 13(c)(7) may perform inside a sawmill.
the niosh report recommendations are driven by information on high-risk activities for all workers, not just patterns of fatalities and serious injuries among young workers.
the department cannot enforce a minimum wage requirement for employees whom the congress has statutorily exempted from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the flsa.
similarly, a youth could be employed to create unique photographs that rise to the level of art, but would be prohibited from developing those photographs and working with the chemicals and solvents commonly used in such processing activities.
the employment of students participating in the work-study program would also most likely be subject to state wage requirements and child labor provisions.
as previously noted, the department expects 30 school districts will have a wsp.
the revision of several of the nonagricultural hos--implementing specific recommendations made by niosh or that arise from the department's enforcement experience--will, in all but one instance involving the use of certain counter-top mixers (ho 11), require employers to assign older workers to perform tasks that previously may have been performed by 16- and 17-year-olds.
under the network model, students do not work more than eight hours a day, before 7 a.m. or after 7 p.m., and are transported to and from their jobs by the school.
with these safeguards, such employment is found not to interfere with the schooling of the minors or with their health and well-being and therefore is not deemed to be oppressive child labor.
the reason for this recommendation that the clc makes here is that if there are osha violations that give rise to child labor violations, then the adults who work with the woodworking machinery are subject to the same workplace hazards as the children.''
such prohibited equipment often have containers or mixing chambers that exceed a 20-ounce capacity--some can accommodate up to 60 quarts.
therefore, the department has revised the proposed regulatory language at sec. 570.37(b)(3)(iii) to emphasize the role of the teacher-coordinator in confirming that the employment of the work-study program participant complies with the child labor and minimum wage requirements of the flsa.
the calendar week would continue to serve as the timeframe for determining whether a minor worked in excess of 18 hours during any week when school was in session or in excess of 40 hours in any week when school was not in session.
all occupations in the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage-stock mill shall mean all work performed in or about any such mill in connection with storing of logs and bolts; converting logs or bolts into sawn lumber, lathers, shingles, or cooperage stock; storing drying, and shipping lumber, laths, shingles, cooperage stock, or other products of such mills; and other work performed in connection with the operation of any sawmill, lath mill, shingle mill, or cooperage-stock mill.
it would not likely result in: (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal, state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of u.s.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.
* * these workers also cut the trees with a chainsaw and drag them from the cutting area and then load them on to a truck.
under sec. 570.33(j) as originally proposed, a retail establishment that sets up an outside sales center to sell such things as garden supplies, plants, outdoor furniture, portable grills, christmas trees, etc., that participates in a retailer association neighborhood ``sidewalk sale'' event, or that routinely displays its wares outside its building may question whether it could use its young sales staff in such endeavors.
such discs were mentioned in the niosh report as cutting equipment that falls outside the prohibitions of ho 14.
these and other settings could cause untoward effects on
(c) occupations that involve operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing hoisting apparatus.
therefore, no initial regulatory flexibility analysis was required.
congressional hearings and the department's enforcement experience have shown that the problems associated with children performing door- to-door sales and street sales are numerous.
for these reasons, the department does not agree with the ywn's understanding that the existing regulation prohibits 14- and 15-year- olds from operating blenders that create ice cream desserts as the department has previously opined that this equipment is a type of ``milk shake blender'' which has long been permitted by sec.
in addition, the nrpa commented that ``[l]ocal park and recreation agencies have a great need to find qualified, capable, and certified lifeguards to work in their outdoor pools, indoor pools, water amusement park facilities, and natural bodies of water.
the department carefully considered this request and, again using its prosecutorial discretion, decided that it would not assert a violation of the child labor provisions when 14- and 15- year-old employees of state and local governments loaded and unloaded the light non-power-driven hand tools--such as rakes, hand-held clippers, and spades--that they personally use as part of their employment.
the clc noted that many of these chemicals pose risks of both short-term and long-term effects on the human body and also are extremely flammable, and hence pose significant fire and explosion hazards.
the term shall include all types of cranes, such as cantilever gantry, crawler, gantry, hammerhead, ingot pouring, jib, locomotive, motor-truck, overhead traveling, pillar jib, pintle, portal, semi-gantry, semi-portal, storage bridge, tower, walking jib, and wall cranes.
570.34(l) to permit the employment of 15-year-olds as lifeguards at swimming pools and water amusement parks under certain conditions.
these are the types of milk shake blenders that 14- and 15- year-olds may operate under reg. 3.
the clc described private messenger services as those that ``have standing contracts with law firms, accounting firms, and other types of businesses'' to deliver documents or packages.
the hearings included a staff study that documented many abuses that had occurred in this industry, including indentured servitude, physical and sexual abuse, and criminal activity.
section 12(a) provides that no producer, manufacturer, or dealer shall ship or deliver for shipment in interstate or foreign commerce any goods produced in an establishment in or about which oppressive child labor was employed within 30 days before removal of the goods.
permitted duties for 15-year-olds include the use of a ladder to access and descend from the lifeguard chair; the use of hand tools to clean the pool and pool area; and the testing and recording of water quality for temperature and/or ph levels, using all of the tools of the testing process including adding chemicals to the test water sample.
in addition, gina also permits the assessment of a civil money penalty up to $50,000 with regard to each violation that caused the death or serious injury of any employee under the age of 18 years.
570.36 work experience and career exploration program.
the niosh statistics show that, despite the fact that workers aged 15 through 17 are generally restricted from employment in hazardous occupations such as mining, motor-vehicle driving, logging, sawmilling, and construction, they have a higher rate of injuries requiring emergency room treatment than any other age group except 18- and 19-year-olds (who are not restricted from performing such work).
the final rule also included the secretary's certification, as permitted by the compactor and baler act, that the new standard ansi z245.5-1997 is as protective of the safety of minors as standard ansi-
while operating the saw, the vehicle upon which he was using the saw fell on him and crushed him to death.
such students may, in accordance with 29 cfr 531.40, make a voluntary assignment of their wages to a third party.
therefore, the department has revised the proposed regulatory language at sec. 570.37(b)(3)(iii) to emphasize the role of the teacher-coordinator in confirming that the employment of the work-study program participant complies with the child labor and minimum wage requirements of the flsa.
for example, the department investigated the employment of a 17-year-old who had both legs amputated in a large industrial baler machine at a recycling center.
instead of a fork or a platform, the lifting device may consist of a ram, scoop, shovel, crane, revolving fork, or other attachments for handling specific loads.
ho 7, however, prohibits older youth only from operating high-lift trucks such as forklifts.
baler that is designed or used to process materials other than paper means a powered machine designed or used to compress materials other than paper and cardboard boxes, with or without binding, to a density or form that will support handling and transportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable container.
in addition, when serving as dispatchers or attendants at the top of an elevated water slide, minors under 16 years of age are not performing, nor can they reasonably be expected to perform, the core lifeguard duty of rescuing swimmers because they are so far removed from the splash- down area of the slide.
the department believes that all these additional safety requirements, when coupled with the provisions of the revised sec. 570.33(i), adequately protect young workers who momentarily enter freezers.
the exemption, contained at section 13(c)(7) of the flsa, allows eligible youth to work inside and outside of places of businesses that use machinery to process wood products, subject to specified limitations.
whd, osha, and niosh then work together to ensure that the appropriate rules are followed and enforced and to learn from each event in the hopes that future tragedies can be prevented.
570.37 (new) would indeed be the employer of the youth under the flsa and held to all the act's minimum wage, overtime, record keeping, and child labor provisions--unless subject to a specific exemption or exception--as would any other employer.
the cristo rey network, which described itself as ``a non-profit corporation that co-ordinates twelve college prep high schools across the country,'' self-identified itself as the network that the department describes in the nprm.
570.35, does not interfere with their schooling or with their health and well-being and shall not be deemed to be oppressive child labor.
this rule was drafted and reviewed in accordance with e.o. 12988 and will not unduly burden the federal court system.
the term shall not include the gathering of forest products such as balsam needles, ginseng, huckleberry greens, maple sap, moss, spanish moss, sphagnum moss, teaberries, and tree seeds; the distillation of gum, turpentine, and rosin if carried on at the gum farm; and the extraction of pine gum.
accordingly, adoption of the recommendations of the ywn and afl-cio that ho 7 also prohibit the operation of such equipment would be premature.
(a) office and clerical work, including the operation of office machines.
administrator means the administrator of the wage and hour division, u.s. department of labor, and includes an authorized representative designated by the administrator to perform any of the functions of the administrator under this part and part 580 of this chapter.

they may work in the feeding and care of animals.
in the 2004 final rule, the secretary certified that standard ansi z245.5-1997 is as protective of the safety of minors as standard ansi-s245.5-1990 and that standard ansi z245.2-1997 is as protective of the safety of minors as standard ansi z245.2-1992.
the department has decided to add abrasive cutting discs to the list of machines prohibited by ho 14 because it would be in keeping with the niosh recommendation and will provide important protections to working youth.
the dolwd also suggested that the federal regulations on the number of hours that 14- and 15-year-olds may work should be amended to be consistent with the more permissive standards established in alaska.
revisions to ho 12 to prohibit the employment of minors in the operation of balers and compactors not currently covered by the ho, and the expansion of ho 14 to add additional power-driven equipment to the list of equipment minors may not operate, are also the result of niosh report recommendations.
the employment of such minors would still be governed by the remaining provisions of reg. 3, including the daily, weekly, morning, and evening hours standards limitations contained in sec.
the department once again notes that it has requested public comment on the issue of exemptions for student-learners and apprentices in the anprm that was published in conjunction with, and on the same day as, the nprm.
* (c) another distinction is that the exemptions provided by the act from the minimum wage and/or overtime provisions are more numerous and differ from the exemptions granted from the child labor provisions.
she noted that the junior lifeguard program is an important tool for recruiting and developing future lifeguards.
another example would be that 14- and 15-year-olds would be permitted to sculpt, but would be prohibited from welding and soldering or any functions that expose them to heat, or to height or other existing restrictions.''
additionally, this document revises the child labor regulations in response to a statutory amendment enacted by the congress that permits certain youth between 14 and 18 years of age who are excused from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade to be employed under specific conditions inside and outside places of business that use machinery to process wood products.
cooking is also permitted with deep fryers that are equipped with and utilize a device which automatically lowers the baskets into the hot oil or grease and automatically raises the baskets from the hot oil or grease.

* * these workers also cut the trees with a chainsaw and drag them from the cutting area to a truck and then load them on to a truck.
an individual private school that was not part of a network, district, or system would also be able to apply to participate in a work study program.
570.62(b)(2) that will permit such youth to operate--but not set-up, adjust, repair, oil, or clean--those power- driven pizza-dough rollers that: (1) are constructed with safeguards contained in the basic design so as to prevent fingers, hands, or clothing from being caught in the in-running point of the rollers; (2) have gears that are completely enclosed; and (3) have microswitches that disengage the machinery if the backs or sides of the rollers are removed.
total dollar cost burden: $14.
artistically creative work would be limited to work in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor.
for example, the department investigated the employment of a 17-year-old who had both legs amputated in a large industrial baler machine at a recycling center.
the youth is required to use, and uses, personal protective equipment to prevent exposure to excessive levels of noise and saw dust.
that would include an [[page 28437]] exemption allowing the employment of 16- and 17-year-olds to operate-- including setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, and cleaning-- lightweight, small capacity, portable counter-top power-driven food mixers that are, or are comparable to, those models intended for household use.
lifeguards may also help to maintain order and cleanliness in the pool and pool areas, give swimming instructions, conduct or officiate at swimming meets, and administer first aid.
multi-state chain restaurant companies, requested that the proposed sec. 570.33(e) include additional language which would emphasize that 14- and 15-year- olds would continue to be permitted to operate all those pieces of kitchen equipment listed in sec.
570.35 hours of work and conditions of employment permitted for minors 14 and 15 years of age.
before a 14- or 15-year-old may legally perform work covered by the flsa, the act requires that the work itself be exempt, or that the secretary of labor has determined that the work to be performed does not constitute oppressive child labor.
the clc noted that although the proposed sec. 570.34(b) contains the statement that artistically creative work is limited to work in a recognized field of artistic or creative endeavor, it does not define the term artistic or creative endeavor.
for example, the afl-cio noted that ``[w]orking in the forest industry can involve working at heights *
regulatory revisions many of the revisions being made by this final rule will result in the redesignation of several sections and subsections of the regulations.
although the greatest number of these injuries and illnesses occurred in meat packing [[page 28435]] plants (5,526), establishments that produce sausages and prepared meats experienced 4,147 injuries and illnesses, and poultry slaughtering and processing establishments experienced 3,937 that same year (see niosh report, page 43).
in addition, each driver transporting the young workers must hold a state driver's license valid for the type of driving involved and, if the driver is under the age of 18, his or her employment must comply with the provisions of sec. 570.52.
in addition, some of this prohibited equipment, when used to process meat or mix batter--with or without the use of special ``attachments''--may not be operated by employees under the age of 18 because of the prohibitions of ho 10 or ho 11, respectively.
any other provisions of the program providing safeguards ensuring that the employment permitted under this section will not interfere with the schooling of the minors or with their health and well-being may also be submitted for use in considering the application.
but because many of the occupations and tasks addressed by the final rule either appear in more than one code or are not included in the codes listed in the report, the department did not use those codes in formulating the definitions used in the final rule.
the clc commented that ``dol's approach here hardly comports with its stated desire to balance `the benefits of employment opportunities with the necessary and appropriate safety protections' (72 fr 19337).
* * had the 14th highest lifetime risk of 5.8 deaths per 1,000 workers'' (see niosh report, page 28).
it serves the best interests of the 14- and 15-year- old parent, as well as the young parent's child, for the parent to complete his or her education, thus realizing a long-term benefit of increased and better employment in the future.''
such classroom instruction shall include, every year the youth participates in the work-study program, training in workplace safety and state and federal child labor provisions and rules.
finally, the clc also questioned, as did the ywn, if the ``host employers'' or the cristo rey high school would be considered the actual employers of the youth under the flsa.
the department notes that, since publishing the nprm, it has investigated the serious injuries of at least ten more young workers who operated or cleaned such equipment.
the report states: ``stationary saws and hand-held saws, including chain saws, continue to be the source of substantial numbers of fatalities as well as nonfatal injuries which may be unusually severe'' (see niosh report, page 56).
in addition, a school could apply and receive authorization under sec.
the ywn also stated that work as a lifeguard may entail exposure to combative individuals, bloodborne pathogens, and chemicals.
the ywn praised the enforcement benefits that would arise from having only one standard in each school district, thereby avoiding multiple schedules that would create unworkable and needlessly complex enforcement standards.
570.59, the section heading is revised to read as follows: sec. 570.59 occupations involved in the operation of power-driven metal forming, punching, and shearing machines (order 8).
the list also includes the occupations of setting up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning the machines.
such employers can consult with the manufacturer of the equipment, the supplier of the equipment, the owner of the equipment if the equipment is leased, industry and/or employer associations, osha, and safety engineering consultants.
(a) the administrative determination of the amount of the civil penalty for each employee who was the subject of a violation of section 12 or section 13(c) of the act relating to child labor or of any regulation under those sections will be based on the available evidence of the violation or violations and will take into consideration the size of the business of the person charged and the gravity of the violations as provided in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section.
the risks associated with poultry catching also occur in the catching and cooping of poultry other than chickens--for example, processors of turkeys and cornish game hens employ similar methods of moving their products to slaughter.
in addition, the hours standards provisions of sec. 570.35 restrict the number of hours and times of day that 14- and 15-year-olds may be employed in any flsa-covered work, including artistic or creative endeavors.
solicitor of labor means the solicitor, u.s. department of labor, and includes attorneys designated by the solicitor to perform functions of the solicitor under this part and part 780 of this chapter.
the department carefully considered this request and, again using its prosecutorial discretion, decided that it would not assert a violation of the child labor provisions when 14- and 15- year-old employees of state and local governments loaded and unloaded the light non-power-driven hand tools--such as rakes, hand-held clippers, and spades--that they personally use as part of their employment.
but the department is concerned that such a system may not give the proper emphasis to obtaining an education and would make employer compliance and whd enforcement more difficult and more complicated than necessary, given the broad variety of daily school schedules that each young employee could have.
finally, with regard to the clc's comment regarding wages, the fact that youth who conduct door-to-door sales usually are exempt from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the flsa in no way detracts from the department's stated objective to develop updated, realistic health and safety standards for today's young workers that are consistent with the established national policy of balancing the benefits of employment opportunities for youth with the necessary and appropriate safety protections.
finally, the ywn believed that some artistically creative work may ``push the envelope on exploitative labor and/or prove detrimental to the morals of youth.''
the department is incorporating the child labor civil money penalty provisions of the gina amendments into this final rule without prior notice and opportunity for public comment because it has for good cause found, pursuant to the administrative procedure act, 5 u.s.c. 553(b)(b), that these procedural requirements are unnecessary with respect to these particular regulatory changes.
finally, the department is also revising sec.
the united states lifesaving association (usla), which described itself as america's nonprofit, professional association of beach lifeguards and open water rescuers, reported that it ``works to reduce the incidence of death and injury in the aquatic environment through public education, promulgation of national lifeguard standards, training programs, promotion of high levels of lifeguard readiness, and other means.''
accordingly, the department is incorporating the provisions of the statutory amendments into the final rule without notice and comment.
the department notes that the ywn's comment that the temperature reached by espresso makers ``exceeds the temperature limits [[page 28410]] established for prohibiting use of other equipment such as anything related to hot oil that exceeds a temperature of 100 degrees f'' does not comport with either the previous or revised provisions of reg. 3.
the clc stated that even in the absence of such a reporting requirement, the department can play an important role by publicizing not only the hazards of working in such places of business, but also the results of any child labor investigations involving woodworking machines.
because these ansi standards are copyright-protected, the department cannot include them in the regulations or reproduce them for distribution to the public.
over sixty percent of that number, 7,280 injuries and illnesses, were caused by food slicers.
the term shall not include work performed in the planing-mill department or other remanufacturing departments of any sawmill or remanufacturing plant not a part of a sawmill.
additionally, this document revises the child labor regulations in response to a statutory amendment enacted by the congress that permits certain youth between 14 and 18 years of age who are excused from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade to be employed under specific conditions inside and outside places of business that use machinery to process wood products.
except for civil penalties collected for violations of section 212 of the flsa, sums collected as penalties pursuant to section 216(e) of the flsa shall be applied toward reimbursement of the costs of determining the violations and assessing and collecting such penalties, in accordance with the provision of section 202 of the act entitled ``an act to authorize the department of labor to make special statistical studies upon payment of the cost thereof and for other purposes'' (29 u.s.c. 9a).
in fact, as discussed earlier, weed-eaters are among the equipment the department is adding as an example of power-driven machinery such youth are prohibited from operating (see sec. 570.33(e) (new)).
finally, the department is well aware of the importance of keeping all stakeholders informed of its compliance assistance initiatives and enforcement findings, and of serious occupational injuries involving youth.
(g) outside window washing that involves working from window sills, and all work requiring the use of ladders, scaffolds, or their substitutes.
the costs imposed by this rule should not be significant for any single entity, and they do not affect a substantial number of small entities in a way that would require an analysis under the regulatory flexibility act.
570.33 occupations that are prohibited to minors 14 and 15 years of age.
this same issue was mentioned by pleasant hill, which noted that it had swimming instructors who were properly certified by the red cross but were not certified as lifeguards.
for purposes of this exemption, a lightweight, small capacity mixer is one that is not hardwired into the establishment's power source, is equipped with a motor that operates at no more than \1/2\ horsepower, and is equipped with a bowl with a capacity of no more than five quarts.
in recognition that the ho now covers poultry processing.
nada stated that vehicle washing ``anecdotally is known as the classic entry-level dealership employment activity *
the report specifically notes the risk of falls and electrocution being linked with such equipment.
the department believes that only a few minors have obtained employment in such occupations since the amendment was enacted and doubts that the number will increase.
under the network model, students do not work more than eight hours a day, before 7 a.m. or after 7 p.m., and are transported to and from their jobs by the school.
it does not include a workroom or workplace solely where meats are smoked.
this section, however, does not prohibit the employment of 14- and 15- year-olds whose duties require them to occasionally enter freezers only momentarily to retrieve items as permitted by sec. 570.34(i).
the employment of such minors would still be subject to the time of day and number of hours standards contained in sec.
both niosh occupational injury data and the department's enforcement experience reflect that injuries occur when youth operate balers and compactors that are designed and used to process materials other than paper.
it does not include work that involves cutting, scraping, or trimming meat from cuts containing bones.
fifteen-year-olds employed as lifeguards would, however, be prohibited from entering or working in any mechanical rooms or chemical storage areas, including any areas where the filtration and chlorinating systems are housed.
the youth would have to be enrolled in a college preparatory curriculum and must receive, every year they participate in the work- study program, at least the minimum number of hours of class room instruction required by the applicable state educational agency responsible for establishing such standards.
the following tasks in forest fire prevention provided none of these tasks may be performed in conjunction with or in support of efforts to extinguish a forest fire: the clearing of fire trails or roads; the construction, maintenance, and patrolling of fire lines; the piling and burning of slash; the maintaining of fire fighting equipment; and acting as a fire lookout or fire patrolman.
the dolwd stated that ``[t]hese provisions would include that the vehicle shall not be running and must be properly secured with the wheels blocked during any loading and unloading operations.''
guillotine shear shall mean a machine equipped with a moveable blade operated vertically and used to shear materials.
such prohibited equipment often have containers or mixing chambers that exceed a 20-ounce capacity--some can accommodate up to 60 quarts.
(vi) clean-up work outside shake and shingle mills, except when the mill is in operation.
the written participation agreement shall be structured to ensure that the quality of the student's education, as well as his or her safety and well-being, are not compromised.
the on-off switch of the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor must be maintained in an off position when the machine is not in operation.
moreover, this rule does not change the limitations on the number of hours per day or per week that 14- and 15-year-olds may work when school is not in session.
the department has over the years documented reports of minors, many as young as 10 or 11 years of age, working as part of mobile sales crews, selling such items as candy, calendars, and greeting cards for profit-making companies.
it is important to note that the clc is incorrect in its assumption that this proposal would permit the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds by messenger service firms that ``have standing contracts with law firms, accounting firms, and other types of businesses'' to deliver documents or small packages.
in addition, youth employed in timber tract, tree farm, and forestry service industries should be permitted to perform tasks related to forest marketing and forest economics that are not performed in a forest.
unlike the machines currently listed in sec. 570.65(a)(1), the prohibition would not be lifted if the chain saws, wood chippers, or reciprocating saws were equipped with full automatic feed and ejection-devices--devices that are almost never found on such equipment.
the department notes that when rules are clearly written and adequately explained, public understanding and compliance follow.
but because greater clarity and protections can be realized, the department will add atvs to the list of named equipment.
(vii) splitting shakes manually from precut and split blocks with a froe and mallet, except inside the mill building or cover.
the department has learned of occupational injuries to workers operating reciprocating saws to cut materials other than wood.
the department appreciates the concerns raised by the ywn, the afl-cio, and the clc regarding the scope of the term youth-employer's establishment.
furthermore, the 16-year-age minimum for employment is applicable to employment in all other occupations unless otherwise provided by regulation or order issued by the secretary.
the act sets a 16-year-age minimum for employment in manufacturing or mining occupations, although under flsa section 13(c)(7), certain youth between the ages of 14 and 18 may, under specific conditions, be employed inside and outside of places of business that use power-driven machinery to process wood products.
they are often required to work many hours on school nights and late into the evening.
expanding this definition thus clarifies that youth are prohibited from operating or assisting in the operation of wood- processing machinery typically found in the workplaces covered by the 2004 amendment.
this enforcement position applies only when all the safeguards detailed above are present on the machine, are operational, and have not been overridden.
(5) work related to forest marketing and forest economics when performed away from the forest.
this exception applies only when all the safeguards detailed in this paragraph are present on the machine, are operational, and have not been overridden.
furthermore, section 13(c)(7) permits the employment of a new entrant inside or outside places of business where machinery is used to process wood products only if the youth is protected from wood particles or other flying debris within the workplace by a barrier appropriate to the potential hazard of such wood particles or flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient distance from machinery in operation, and is required to use personal protective equipment to prevent exposure to excessive levels of noise and saw dust.
but the department is concerned that such a system may not give the proper emphasis to obtaining an education and would make employer compliance and whd enforcement more difficult and more complicated than necessary, given the broad variety of daily school schedules that each young employee could have.
the ho also prevents such minors from performing all occupations involved in the operation or feeding of several power-driven meat processing machines when performed in slaughtering and meat packing establishments, as well as in wholesale, retail, or service establishments.
the second modification clarifies the role of the teacher-coordinator.
(k) loading and unloading of goods or property onto or from motor vehicles, railroad cars, or conveyors, except the loading and unloading of personal non-power-driven hand tools, personal protective equipment, and personal items to and from motor vehicles as permitted by sec. 570.34(k).
in 1999, the department investigated the death of a young poultry processing worker in arkansas and the serious injury of a similarly employed minor in missouri who injured both of his legs when he slipped and fell into an auger.
in bringing the regulations into conformity with the statutory amendments, the department is not exercising any interpretative authority.
section 13(c)(7) of the flsa provides a limited exemption from the child labor provisions for certain youths between the ages of 14 and 18 years who, by statute or judicial order, are excused from compulsory school attendance beyond the eighth grade, that permits their employment inside and outside of places of business that use power- driven machinery to process wood products.
the reason for this recommendation that the clc makes here is that if there are osha violations that give rise to child labor violations, then the adults who work with the woodworking machinery are subject to the same workplace hazards as the children.''
570.34(a) (old) and all the prohibited occupations contained in sec. 570.34(b) (old) that currently apply only to retail, food service, and gasoline service establishments.
flsa section 13(d) provides an exemption from the child labor provisions, as well as the minimum wage and overtime provisions, for homeworkers engaged in the making of wreaths composed principally of natural holly, pine, cedar, or other evergreens (including the harvesting of the evergreens or other forest products used in making such wreaths).
fourteen- and 15-year-olds could not be employed to clean such work places, even after hours, because of whd's long-standing interpretation that a work place retains its character--and child labor continues to be prohibited--even at times when nothing is being mined, processed, or manufactured.
the report also recommends, alternatively, that the department consider developing a new ho that would prohibit all sawing machinery that performs cutting and sawing functions through direct contact of the cutting surface and the material being processed.
the administrator shall have discretion to grant requests for special variations if the applicant demonstrates that the activity will be performed under adequate supervision and training (including safety precautions) and that the terms and conditions of the proposed employment will not interfere with the health or well-being or schooling of the minor enrolled in an approved program.
three titanium plates were permanently implanted into the minor's skull.
although the exemption allows certain youths between the ages of 14 and 18 years to be employed inside and outside of places of business that use power-driven machines to process wood products, it does so only if such youths do not operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines.
the red cross objected to the department including the task of ``giving swimming instructions'' in the list of duties that 15-year-olds may perform because the red cross lifeguard training course does not include training on how to give swimming instructions.
however, the list of prohibited occupations is not intended to identify every prohibited occupation, but rather only to provide examples of those prohibited occupations that have historically been the most common sources of violations or concern.
as stated in the final rule, whd will continue to rely on osha's expertise for guidance when applying the specific occupational health and safety-affecting requirements of flsa section 13(c)(7) (see sec.
(c) cooking with electric or gas grills which does not involve cooking over an [[page 28450]] open flame (note: this provision does not authorize cooking with equipment such as rotisseries, broilers, pressurized equipment including fryolators, and cooking devices that operate at extremely high temperatures such as ``neico broilers'').
the department also proposed to reformat, in an alphabetical sequence, all the definitions found in sec. 570.61(b) to comport with guidance provided by the federal register.
the current sec. 570.65(a)(2) would be redesignated as sec. 570.65(a)(3) and revised to reflect that 16- and 17-year-olds could not be employed in occupations involving the setting-up, adjusting, repairing, oiling, or cleaning of any of the equipment covered by the ho.
the department believes additional information is needed before it can address such a broad recommendation that would impact all construction occupations.
the report notes that while these large specialized balers are generally found in facilities that specialize in processing scrap and waste materials, smaller general-purpose portable machines that serve the same functions are marketed for use in businesses such as grocery stores, hotels, restaurants, and hospitals.
niosh notes that work in sic 083, forest nurseries and gathering of forest products, is associated with very small numbers of fatalities and should not be prohibited by ho 4.
high-lift truck shall mean a power-driven industrial type of truck used for lateral transportation that is equipped with a power-operated lifting device usually in the form of a fork or platform capable of tiering loaded pallets or skids one above the other.
570.34(a)(8) (old) to include all motor vehicles.
this commenter stated that through door-to-door sales ``many kids learn how to be confident and build communication skills with adults.''
curing cellar includes a workroom or workplace which is primarily devoted to the preservation and flavoring of meat, including poultry, by curing materials.
by removing this subsection, the department removes the exception for timber tract and forestry service occupations.
the ywn assumed that the department's proposal would also ban the employment of 14- and 15-year-olds to perform sign waving, ``including holding or carrying of any type, posing or acting as a sign not directly in front of a retail establishment, or where no direct supervision exists'' (emphasis in original).
the economic and social costs associated with the deaths and serious injuries of young workers are substantial.
the minor was not operating the forklift at the time of his death but was serving as a ``spotter'' and assisting the operator of the forklift.
(f) the operation of motor vehicles; the service as helpers on such vehicles except those tasks permitted by sec. 570.34(k); and the riding on a motor vehicle, inside or outside of an enclosed passenger compartment, except as permitted by sec.
helper shall mean a person who assists in the operation of a machine covered by this section by helping place materials into or remove them from the machine.
the concentration or distillation of these products, when carried out in the forest, is also included [[page 28430]] in this industry.
570.63(b) to mean a powered machine designed or used to compress materials other than paper or cardboard boxes, with or without binding, to a density or form that will support handling and transportation as a material unit without requiring a disposable or reusable container.
the prohibition would include the catching and cooping of all poultry, not just chickens.
as used in this section: boning occupations means the removal of bones from meat cuts.
the department recognizes niosh's extensive research efforts in compiling and reviewing this data.
operators place the glass jar on top of the base, place the ingredients in the jar, affix the lid to the jar, press the appropriate button or switch, and blend the product.
as used in this section: outside school hours means such periods as before and after school hours, holidays, summer vacations, weekends, and any other day or part of a day when school is not in session as determined by the local public school district in which the minor resides when employed.
the employment of certain youth by places of business where machinery is used to process wood products
they may work in the construction, operation, repair, or maintenance of living and administrative quarters of logging camps.
in addition, such data for youth 16 and 17 years of age tend to be mixed with that of older workers whose employment is not subject to the child labor provisions of the flsa.
the representative of pleasant hill also noted that youth aged 11 to 14 years of age participate in her facility's junior lifeguard program.
furthermore, the employer must also post a notice on the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor that conveys certain information, including the identification of the applicable ansi standard that the equipment meets, that 16- and 17-year-old employees may only load the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor, and that no employee under the age of 18 may operate or unload the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor.
in administering the flsa, the department does not consider such individuals, who volunteer or donate their services, usually on a part-time basis, for public service, religious, or humanitarian objectives, without contemplation of pay, to be employees of the religious, charitable, or similar nonprofit corporations that receive their services.
therefore, the department requested in the nprm that the public provide information that would help it identify which occupations or tasks within the timber tract, tree farm, and forestry services industries are not particularly hazardous to youth.
the clc stated that it believes it is ``ill-advised to excuse 14- and 15-year-olds from compulsory school attendance on the basis of parental status.
it expressed concerns that office equipment, such as large paper shredders and data processing machines with exposed moving parts, may present hazards to young workers.
for such employment to comply with reg. 3, the employee would have to be at least 15 years of age and be properly certified.
the department has decided to revise the title of ho 12 to reflect that, under the final rule, it will prohibit occupations involved in the operation of all balers and compactors, including those that do not process any paper products.
indeed, non-public schools could be established by organizations whose prime goal is to provide 14- and 15-year-old working children to employers during normal business hours in the middle of the day, rather than to make sure that the children are in school during the hours when they are most alert and receptive to classroom instruction.
the crew leaders, who often have ties to regional or national businesses, mistakenly claim that they and their young sales crews are independent contractors.
under the proposal, all occupations in forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention would include the controlling and extinguishing of fires, the wetting down of areas or extinguishing of spot fires, and the patrolling of burned areas to ensure the fire has been extinguished.
the employment of minors under 14 years of age is not permissible under any circumstances if the employment is covered by the child labor provisions and not specifically exempt.
elevator shall mean any power-driven hoisting or lowering mechanism equipped with a car or platform which moves in guides in a substantially vertical direction.
questions of interpretation and/or enforcement of regulations issued by this agency or referenced in this final rule may be directed to the nearest wage and hour division district office.
the department also notes, as it has stated previously in this final rule, that its limited and public exercise of its prosecutorial discretion is an efficient and permissible tool available to the secretary in the administration of the child labor provisions of the flsa.
the information provided, which also echoed the department's enforcement experiences, indicated that such factors as bowl capacity, the horsepower of the motor, the portability of the machine (light weight and not permanently wired or ``hardwired'' into the establishment's electrical power source), and similarity to equipment designed exclusively for home use were all important criteria.
such slides, which often reach heights of over 40 feet, rely on power-driven machinery that pump water to the top of the slides which facilitates the descents of the riders to the ``splash-down'' areas at the base of the slides.
participating youth would also be required to receive annual classroom instruction in workplace safety and child labor provisions.
the exemption also prohibits the minor from performing any driving involving the towing of vehicles; route deliveries or route sales; the transportation for hire of property, goods, or passengers; urgent, time-sensitive deliveries; or the transporting of more than three passengers at any one time.
questions of interpretation and/or enforcement of regulations issued by this agency or referenced in this final rule may be directed to the nearest wage and hour division district office.
the exemption, contained in section 13(c)(7) of the flsa, allows eligible youth, under specific conditions, to be employed by businesses that use machinery to process wood products, but does not allow such youth to operate or assist in operating power-driven woodworking machines.
the department appreciates the concerns of the one employer and two employer associations that recommended that an employee's own academic schedule and individual attendance requirements should be used to determine when school is in session for that minor and recognizes how such a position could be seen as a means of providing minors with more work experiences while addressing employer staffing problems.
the ywn also noted that ``back hoes'' and ``front-end-loaders'' would fall within the definition of high-lift trucks and recommended, for the sake of clarity, that the department specifically name them in the revised sec. 570.58(b).
assisting in tasks being performed by the machines would be tending the machines.
inside or outside places of business shall mean the actual physical location of the establishment employing the youth, including the buildings and surrounding land necessary to the business operations of that establishment.
because very little substantive information was received, the department withdrew the anprm on february 24, 2010.
the revision would permit 15-year-olds, but not 14-year-olds, to be employed as lifeguards, performing lifeguard duties, at traditional swimming pools and certain areas of amusement water parks operated by all types of employers, if the minors have been trained and certified by the red cross or a similarly recognized certifying organization.
properly certified 15-year-olds would be permitted to be employed as lifeguards at most of these water park features.
operate or assist in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines includes operating such machines, including supervising or controlling the operation of such machines, feeding material into such machines, helping the operator feed material into such machines, unloading materials from such machines, and helping the operator unload materials from such machines.
the youth must also be protected from wood particles or other flying debris within the workplace by a barrier appropriate to the potential hazard of such wood particles or flying debris or by maintaining a sufficient distance from machinery in operation.
a representative of morey's pier of wildwood, new jersey, whose comments were submitted by the iaapa, supported the proposal to allow the employment of 15-year-olds as lifeguards at traditional swimming pools and water amusement parks.
students, their parents, and the work-study director sign an agreement defining performance expectations and program support structures.
the child labor provisions of the fair labor standards act (flsa) establish a minimum age of 16 years for employment in nonagricultural occupations, but the secretary of labor is authorized to provide by regulation for 14- and 15-year-olds to work in suitable occupations other than manufacturing or mining, and during periods and under conditions that will not interfere with their schooling or health and well-being.
the department appreciates the ywn's recommendation that ho 10 should be expanded to cover seafood processing occupations, but notes that no data was submitted regarding the level of youth employment in that industry or the injury rates experienced by that industry.
finally, the ywn believed that some artistically creative work may ``push the envelope on exploitative labor and/or prove detrimental to the morals of youth.''
he stated ``such a rule would cripple career technical education (cte) programs that have work-based learning opportunities embedded within the curriculum.''
in order for employers to take advantage exception discussed in this of the limited exception discussed in section, the scrap paper this section, the paper box compactor baler must meet one of the must meet one of the following ansi following ansi standards: standards: ------------------------------------------------------------------------
the employment (including suffering or permitting to work) by an employer of minors 14 and 15 years of age in occupations detailed in sec.
the administrator shall have discretion to grant requests for special variations if the applicant demonstrates that the activity will be performed under adequate supervision and training (including safety precautions) and that the terms and conditions of the proposed employment will not interfere with the health or well-being or schooling of the minor enrolled in an approved program.
570.37 (new), the participating school district and employers share the burden of ensuring that the employment of work- study program participants is in compliance with the flsa.
the department notes that it is not imposing any recordkeeping burdens on the employers or the school districts beyond those proposed in the 2007 nprm, therefore no additional estimates of costs or burdens will be incurred that [[page 28429]] must be accounted for pursuant to the paperwork reduction act and regulatory flexibility act.
in 2001, the department investigated the serious injury of a 17-year-old who suffered a fractured skull when the wood chipper he was feeding ``spit out''
in addition, when a school system files a letter of application to renew an existing work-study program, it will be required to note that the teacher-coordinator has confirmed that the employment of students in the work-study program has been in compliance with the child labor and minimum wage provisions of the flsa.
the written participation agreement shall be structured to ensure that the quality of the student's education, as well as his or her safety and well-being, are not compromised.
the department was able to quickly put an end to this unacceptable employment by not only enforcing the child labor and minimum wage provisions of the flsa, but by partnering with local law enforcement authorities to ensure that city and state laws addressing community standards were enforced.
all those occupations in which 14- and 15- year-olds may be employed when the work is performed outside school hours and is confined to other specified limits.
580.6 filed with the secretary an exception to the determination that the violation or violations for which the penalty is imposed occurred.
when a civil money penalty is assessed against an employer for a child labor violation, the employer has the right, within 15 days after receipt of the notice of such penalty, to file an exception to the determination that the violation or violations occurred.
such work would include, for example, delivering items to a customer or assisting passengers with the loading and unloading of their luggage in conjunction with the operation of an airport shuttle van.
under the proposed rule, no youth under 15 years of age, whether properly certified or not, could legally perform any portion of the lifeguard duties detailed above as part of his or her flsa covered employment.
an incomplete or inaccurate posting by the facilities manager or owner will not relieve an employer from being charged with a violation of ho 12 or assessed a child labor civil money penalty.
[[page 28431]] the niosh recommendations, except that it believed that 16- and 17- year-olds, after completion of the ten-hour construction safety and health course certified by osha, could safely be employed to work in the construction of living and administrative quarters of logging camps.
the other provisions of sec. 570.35 (limiting employment to no more than 8 hours a day on any one day school is not in session, and no more than 40 hours in any one week when school is not in session) remain applicable to the employment of wecep participants.
in addition, the clc noted that such minors would be permitted to work up to eight hours a day and up to forty hours a week at computers, typing or inputting data, during non-school weeks.
a strict adherence to reg. 3 requirements would not permit the employment of a 14- or 15- year-old in any of these scenarios, even though talented and motivated youth could safely and successfully perform these tasks without interfering with their schooling or health and well-being.
niosh reports on its web site (see http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/youth) that in 2007, an estimated 48,600 work-related injuries and illnesses among youth 15 to 17 years of age were treated in hospital emergency departments.
section 570.55 lists, when discussing the prohibited occupations involved in the operation of power-driven woodworking machines, such activities as supervising or controlling the operation of the machines, feeding materials into such machines, and helping the operator feed material into such machines.
the clc noted that the niosh report recommended that ho 7 prohibit 16- and 17-year-olds from employment that, among other things, included ``assisting in tasks being performed'' by the power-driven hoisting equipment.
the exemption, contained at section 13(c)(7) of the flsa, allows eligible youth to work inside and outside of places of businesses that use machinery to process wood products, subject to specified limitations.
(e) occupations that involve operating, tending, setting up, adjusting, cleaning, oiling, or repairing any power-driven machinery, including but not limited to lawn mowers, golf carts, all-terrain vehicles, trimmers, cutters, weed-eaters, edgers, food slicers, food grinders, food choppers, food processors, food cutters, and food mixers.
the department is also adding to that section its long-standing position that outside school hours means such periods as before and after school hours, holidays, summer vacations, weekends, and any other day or part of a day when the local public school district where the minor resides while employed is not in session.
the department also wishes to assure both the ywn and clc that employers participating in the work-study program authorized by sec.
crews often work from late afternoon to late at night as that is when most of the potential customers are likely to be at home.
this approach seems to us to give far more emphasis to work experiences for 14- and 15-year-olds than to their education.''
regarding the types of work that 14-year-olds employed under the provisions of flsa section 13(c)(7) may perform inside a sawmill.
with respect to employment in occupations other than manufacturing and mining and in accordance with the provisions of flsa section 13(c)(7), the secretary is authorized to issue regulations or orders lowering the age minimum to 14 years where he or she finds that such employment is confined to periods that will not interfere with the minors' schooling and to conditions that will not interfere with their health and well-being.
any such unlawful act or practice may be enjoined by the united states district courts under section 17 upon court action, filed by the secretary pursuant to section 12(b) and, if willful will subject the offender to the criminal penalties provided in section 16(a) of the act.
the department did not propose to prohibit, and the final rule does not prohibit, 14- and 15-year-olds from operating espresso machines as recommend by the ywn, the afl-cio, and the representative of the billings, montana job service.
the report states: ``stationary saws and hand-held saws, including chain saws, continue to be the source of substantial numbers of fatalities as well as nonfatal injuries which may be unusually severe'' (see niosh report, page 56).
it also commented that it found it difficult to construct reasons that differentiate the natural environment from the pool environment, given that many of the reasons for establishing a minimum age of 16 years for employment as a lifeguard at a natural environment facility are equally applicable at traditional pools.
the department notes that although niosh did not include injury data specific to the operation of abrasive cutting discs, niosh did report that the potential contact with the moving disk of an abrasive cutting tool does put operators at risk.
likewise, a 14- or 15-year-old could be employed, with all the safeguards of sec.
570.35, shall not be deemed to be oppressive child labor within the meaning of the fair labor standards act of 1938, as amended.
570.37 (new) to operate a work-study program for just one student, one group of students, or, as in the case of the cristo rey network, the entire student body.
during enforcement actions involving employers who avail themselves of the limited exemption contained in sec. 570.63(c)(1), the department routinely confirms whether the scrap paper baler or paper box compactor being loaded by 16- or 17-year-olds meets the requirements of the applicable ansi standard, as determined and declared by the employer.
j. occupations involved in the operation of paper-products machines, scrap paper balers, and paper box compactors (order 12) (29 cfr 570.63)
in addition, gina also permits the assessment of a civil money penalty not to exceed $50,000 with regard to each violation that caused the death or serious injury of any employee under the age of 18 years.
such minors would not be permitted to load or unload such jobsite- related equipment as barriers, cones, or signage.
rules that limit permissible job activities for working youth to those that are safe do not, by themselves, impose significant added costs on employers, in our view.
the occupations of operation or assisting to operate any baler that is designed or used to process materials other than paper.
although the statute does not define the terms adult and relative, the department proposed that, for purpose of this exemption, a relative would include a parent (or person standing in place of a parent), a grandparent, an aunt, an uncle, and a sibling; and an adult would be someone who has reached his or her eighteenth birthday.
cooking is also permitted with deep fryers that are equipped with and utilize a device which automatically lowers the baskets into the hot oil or grease and automatically raises the baskets from the hot oil or grease.
the fmi stated that adopting the hours of the local public school when defining the term school is in session would ``make no sense'' for the many young people who do not go to public schools.
in addition, in order to be employed inside or outside of places of business where machinery is used to process wood products, the new entrant must be supervised by an adult relative or an adult member of the same religious sect or division as the entrant.
in addition to the regularly scheduled visits to the workplaces the teacher-coordinator is required to make, the department suggests that such things as frequent interactions with the work-study program students, program assessments and evaluations completed by the students and the employers, and surprise or unscheduled visits to the workplaces can all contribute to the operation of a safe, compliant, and positive work-study program.
the limitations on the number of hours that participating students may be employed (see sec. 570.37(c) (new)), though in line with those established by the cristo rey network, constitute the absolute maximum number of hours that participants may be employed.
finally, the department acknowledges the concerns of pleasant hill which raised the issue of ``junior lifeguard programs'' and the ``volunteer'' participation of youths between the ages of 11 and 14 in such endeavors.
the clc believed that such publicizing will remind all american youth, their parents, and their employers ``of the grave dangers that these machines represent to working children.''
this act, among other things, amends section 16(e) of the fair labor standards act by increasing the maximum permissible civil money penalty an employer may be assessed for child labor violations that cause the death or serious injury of a young worker.
to clarify that the limited exemption to ho 11 which permits 16- and 17-year-olds to operate certain lightweight, small capacity, portable counter-top power-driven food mixers (see sec. 570.62(b)(1)) would not apply when the equipment is adapted--through the use of various attachments--to perform functions other than mixing, or to process meat or poultry products because of the prohibitions of ho 10.
the report states: ``construction work has high risks for fatal and nonfatal injuries and should not be exempted in the construction of living or administrative quarters at logging sites or mills'' (see niosh report, page 27).
the department believes that the teacher-coordinator occupies an ideal position to both help the employer attain and maintain compliance with the all the requirements of work-study program and assist the department's enforcement efforts by confirming that compliance.
the superintendent of the public or private school system supervising and administering the work-study program shall file with the administrator of the wage and hour division a letter of application for approval of the work-study program as one not interfering with schooling or with the health and well-being of the minors involved and therefore not constituting oppressive child labor.
in 2001, the department investigated the serious injury of a 17-year-old who suffered a fractured skull when the wood chipper he was feeding ``spit out'' a 12-inch long, 4-inch diameter, piece of a tree branch.
the department enforced all the other provisions of reg. 3, including the restrictions on hours of work, with respect to the employment of such minors.
as used in this section: all occupations in forest fire fighting and forest fire prevention shall include the controlling and extinguishing of fires, the wetting down of areas or extinguishing of spot fires, and the patrolling of burned areas to assure the fire has been extinguished.
any costs that might result from using older employees to perform the previously permitted tasks would be more than offset by reduced health and productivity costs resulting from accidents and injuries to minors on the job.
the department believes that before any changes to the existing exemptions are made, it is important to first consider and develop criteria for determining when apprenticeship and student-learners exemptions are appropriate.
hoist-related fatalities of young workers have been reported, including a recent case in which a youth was killed while operating a half-ton capacity hoist'' (see niosh report, page 36).
finally, on may 21, 2008, after publication of the nprm, the genetic information nondiscrimination act of 2008 (gina), public law 110-233, was signed into law.
the transportation of the persons or property does not have to be the primary reason for the trip for this exception to apply.
