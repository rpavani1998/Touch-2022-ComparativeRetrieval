fuels from biomass are not sustainable, are ecologically destructive, have a net energy loss, and there isn’t enough biomass in america to make significant amounts of energy because essential inputs like water, land, fossil fuels, and phosphate ores are limited.energy farming is playing a huge role in deforestion, reducing biodiversity, water and water quality, and increasing soil erosion.this is causing long-term harm to the world’s river ecosystems and raising risks that many coastal areas — sometimes hundreds of miles from the dams — will be flooded soon because they are deprived of sediments that help offset soil erosion.growing plants for fuel will accelerate the already unacceptable levels of topsoil erosion, soil carbon and nutrient depletion, soil compaction, water retention, water depletion, water pollution, air pollution, eutrophication, destruction of fisheries, siltation of dams and waterways, salination, loss of biodiversity, and damage to human health  (tegtmeier 2004).growing plants for fuel will accelerate the already unacceptable levels of topsoil erosion, soil carbon and nutrient depletion, soil compaction, water retention, water depletion, water pollution, air pollution, eutrophication, destruction of fisheries, siltation of dams and waterways, salination, loss of biodiversity, and damage to human health (tegtmeier 2004).dams create habitats more easily invaded by invasive plants, fish, snails, insects, and animals 7) dams can increase ghg as impounded water gets choked with rotting vegetationfertilizers increase global warming, acid rain, and eutrophication .http://www.iwla.org/publications/agriculture/farm_bill_2007_web.pdf water pollution soil erosion is a serious source of water pollution, since it causes runoff of sediments, nutrients, salts, eutrophication, and chemicals that have had no chance to decompose into streams.resource and sustainability barriers 1)      biomass feedstock will ultimately be limited by finite amounts of land and water 2)      biomass production may not be sustainable because of impacts on soil compaction, erosion, carbon, and nutrition.resource and sustainability barriers 1) biomass feedstock will ultimately be limited by finite amounts of land and water 2) biomass production may not be sustainable because of impacts on soil compaction, erosion, carbon, and nutrition.offshore windmills could conflict with other uses: offshore windparks will affect sediment transport, potentially clogging navigation channels, erosion, depositing of sediment on recreational areas, affect shoreline vegetation, scour sediments leading to loss of habitat for benthic communities, and damage existing seabed infrastructure.“for solar power, the life cycle for solar photovoltaic systems requires the use of hazardous materials which must be minded from the earth and can contaminate areas of land when such systems break down or are destroyed, such as during hurricanes and tornados.deforestation of temperate hardwood forests, and conversion of range and wetlands to grow energy and food crops increases global warming .crop residues are essential for soil protection, nutrition, water retention, and soil carbon.soil carbon sequestration impacts on global climate change and food security.
