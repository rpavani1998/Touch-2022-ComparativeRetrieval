electric vehicles offer considerable potential for electricity storage when demand is low at night, as well as holding the key to decarbonising transport, which currently accounts for a quarter of all carbon emissions.in a civilisation intent on ensuring its own survival, much less prosperity, we would be using home-made sources of renewable energy, with great efficiency and fairness, and investing our own money to roll out ever more green infrastructure with which to build resilient local and national economies, so creating worthwhile jobs for our children.urban planning, the replacement of antiquated urban infrastructures and the development of institutional capacities can produce significant ghg reductions and lead to relatively rapid changes in residentsâ€™ energy consumption and behaviors.smog-causing ozone and soot emissions are already stringently regulated, but emissions can be reduced further (with enormous co-benefits for health, food crops and property) with broader, stricter controls.investment in low-carbon technologies will bring huge economic benefits both regionally and nationally and will allow the uk government to realise its ambition to become a green leader.the installation of an efficient, cost effective, clean fuels infrastructure will provide a significant boost to the biofuels industry and make america a cleaner, safer and better place to live.energy independence and access are major drivers for the implementation of clean technology practices, with energy source diversification a key, long-term indicator of sustainable economic growth.it would push us, the public, towards electing courageous leaders who are willing to act on the sustainability principle against vested corporate interests.it would push our leaders towards redefining national socio-economic health in terms of sustainability rather than growth, an important imperative for all nations.the clean electricity would power not only homes and businesses, but also vehicles.consumers will start making impactful choices very quickly, organisations will rapidly develop alternatives to avoid being left behind and market subsidies will quickly disappear as subsidy funding, carbon costly activities die out and beneficial activities achieve cost efficiencies to replace diminishing subsidies.in china, lung cancer caused by air pollution is now the leading cause of death in urban areas.funding is also crucial for improving energy efficiency in buildings, which account for around 40% of eu carbon emissions.saving energy is the most cost-efficient way of cutting greenhouse gas emissions.such shifts not only influence consumer preferences and values but also create credibility pressure on and legitimacy for policy makers to introduce regulations, motivating development of new goals and subsequently use science and technology to adjust the economic sub-system, and address market failures with policy instruments such as environmental taxes, subsidies and tradable permits; however, it is necessary to focus on rational resource allocation decisions under the existing conditions of scarcity.
