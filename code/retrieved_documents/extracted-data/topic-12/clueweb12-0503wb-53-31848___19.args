oh well, no system is perfect, and my system probably has some flaws which, even though not readily apparent to me or my players, may be apparent to someone else.
you can't even spend that time learning new languages, learning stories or songs, or doing anything you would normally consider advantageous.
it would only be with the continuous and repeated study of the same things again and again over a period of 400,000 astral days that you may eventually hope to remember any language or other complex time consuming study or training you learned while on the astral plane.
ethereal acid will hurt you, but not as badly as normal.
it is practically a death sentence to enter most of these planes without the proper preparations.
the exceptions are huge concentrations of metal ores, thick sheets of more refine metals, and the living material of most creatures found in the monstrous manual as they generate a sufficient aura of energy which ethereal matter cannot pass though.
therefore, time may easily run differently when you are on different planes of existence.
if you agree or you can live with other people's rules, that's great; if not, then you shouldn't feel obligated to do so.
combat in the border ethereal is identical to combat in the deep ethereal except for the time differential problems of short-term memory.
this would be like traveling at 10,000 times your normal movement rate or about 240,000 miles in ten hours (making the top deep ethereal travel speed about 24,000 mph).
once there, the short-term spiritual memories have time to become long-term chemical memories, and you may remember or forget them, depending on how good your character's long-term memory really is.
this travel is usually along a great circle route unless going through the planet's crust, which is a somewhat more dangerous proposition.
with the proper tuning forks a group can travel from the pmp directly to any of the four elemental planes or directly to the ethereal or astral planes.
on my world, in my universe, this isn't a necessary balancing force; there are very good reasons to play either character class, and without orlantian historical reasons not to draw blood, it makes no sense to avoid doing so and much more sense that a cleric should use the weapon most often depicted or associated with their particular deity.
time also acts differently under extremely strong gravitational fields such as near a neutron star or close to the event horizon of a black hole.
this has the advantage of drawing on the creativity and hard work of others, and gives a broader scope to my ad&d universe.
of course, survival within one of these inner planes may be problematic.
short-term memories are partially retained in a more spiritual manner within the spirit or soul.
next, those planes that border the +mp or border the -mp include the quasi-elemental planes.
closer to the same time as the pmp, these places are typically the homes of such races as the githyanki or the githzerai and are generally located outside, but near a solar system.
if no particular weapon readily comes to mind for a given deity, the cleric should feel free to use any weapon of their choice, including a sword or other edged weapon.
for now, it is enough to know that reaching the first layers of the outer planes may be accomplished via the astral plane or through the so called conduits which connect them directly to the pmp.
and, of course, that's why i like to keep the outer planes and the gods a bit of a mystery.
also, some now dead material of once living creatures that had various ethereal properties may be employed as a method of blocking ethereal matter from transit.
for example, a hurricane may open a nexus into the elemental plane of air or a particularly powerful bolt of lightning may open one into the quasi-elemental plane of lightning.
traveling via ship would take weeks and this is too long.
just avoid dms who are jerks whenever possible.
now traveling to katana would only take 3 or 4 hours, 1/100th the time of the sea voyage.
until it does, however, it can drown you.
thus, you travel to the border ethereal via aplane shift spell.
this doesn't take into account the hours of back breaking work, the blisters and splinters, and the aching knees and joints which would result from such an endeavor and naturally make one reluctant to do it at all; to say nothing of ruining a perfectly good spoon.
if you travel via the border ethereal plane, the wizard will almost certainly kill your friends in katana before you'd arrive to stop him.
in the meantime, the possibility the gods i use on my world and the gods of classical mythology, as well as other mythologies, may have had an influence on historical earth and therefore be one and the same gods is still open.
e.g., an 18 intelligence for a magic user would be +1 to hit, +2 to damage.
since it is a fact our pcs tend to migrate from universe to universe, or from one dm's world to another dm's world, it is always nice to have gross similarities between universes.
for example, you have to rest, study, or pray 400,000 times longer to get your spells back, to naturally heal, to accumulate life force or experience, or in many other ways, to get anything worthwhile done on that plane.
once inside the deep ethereal, you can seek out the proper curtain to one of the inner planes or to the pmp.
other typical uses of temporary nexus points might include a gate which opens up onto the first level of hell, on the far side of orlantia, on a different planet in a different solar system, or even somewhere else.
oh well, no system is perfect, and my system probably has some flaws which, even though not readily apparent to me or my players, may be apparent to someone else.
i don't have a problem with such things; so my world doesn't have a problem with such things.
if you could change that number, you'd be on another plane.
all those things passed from spiritual short-term memory long ago and never had a chance to become chemical long-term memories.
so far, no matter what protections were given, the travelers have never returned.
naturally, one can see why the official word from on high might wish to avoid even these simple equations, as they wouldn't want a certain level of physics or mathematics to be a prerequisite to playing ad&d.
other typical uses of temporary nexus points might include a gate which opens up onto the first level of hell, on the far side of orlantia, on a different planet in a different solar system, or even somewhere else.
finally, be aware it takes approximately 1,500 gp in cost to buy even one plane shift scroll, let alone the 3,000-gp cost for two (got to get back home, you know?).
it is easiest to enter these planes from the ethereal plane by passing through the correct color ethereal curtain.
you next pass through the ethereal curtain into the deep ethereal plane.
this bonus is not to exceed the bonus for a score of 20 or higher for pcs.
natural weapons such as hands, feet, claws, and teeth still do normal damage.
(if a player still insists on trying to do something like this when you feel he should try other, more obvious methods besides brute force, perhaps suggesting a halt to the game until next session may make him think otherwise.
next, those planes that border the +mp or border the -mp include the quasi-elemental planes.
(a normally +1 bow shooting a normally +1 arrow is now +0 since the -1 penalty applies to each item, and such an arrow will do no damage).
that plane, like the ethereal plane, is tied to the prime material plane in a very real, but mysterious way.
this wind makes things on the pmp, when an ethereal creature can see them, appear to be in a different location from their real location.
it is these rare, but few and far between events that give you the little experience your dm awards you upon your leaving the astral plane.
usually, adventurers may travel to the proper pool if they have done so before, are guided by an astral native, or have a map of some sort.
there are ways to shape the smaller pockets of demi-planes that can affect the strength of gravity, up to a point.
gas attacks are less effective as the pcs can survive without air for up to 10 times longer in the border ethereal and 100 times longer in the deep ethereal.
the closer they get the closer to pmp or other planar time they also get.
relatively secure in the astral plane in such a place, since the time is so similar to the time on the pmp, a wizard could learn spells, do spell research, create magic items and scrolls, and other normal activities as their body is functioning in a normal time stream.
since there was no time "before" the big bang, and also no elsewhere for the universe to come from, we can see we are hopelessly trying to fit a real, but unique non-everyday situation into the mind set of our everyday frame of reality; but not everything has a past, a present, or a future.
if you so desire you can travel to such a plane in a one way manner without the aid of aplane shift spell.
to get to the first layer of an outer plane using plane shift, you must first plane shift to the astral plane where you can then travel to the proper pool or plane shift directly to the outer plane if you have the proper tuning fork.
for example, the nexus point to the paraelemental plane of ice that occurs every eighteen years always opens up in the same place on the surface of the imperial sea and stays open for one folar (10 days).
right away i didn't see the need for time to run differently, so it doesn't in my universe.
also, one day on the astral plane near earth would seem to be 365,250 days or 1,000 earth years on the astral plane.
as it turns out, i have probably done just that; in fact, more often than going my own way.
in a similar fashion, i like the gods to remain obscure.
i at least like to play real characters.
only some natives of the ethereal plane, like phase spiders, can detect this wind and take such displacements into account.
this has the effect of solitary confinement for centuries or even millennium while waiting only minutes or days on the pmp.
all those things passed from spiritual short-term memory long ago and never had a chance to become chemical long-term memories.
the alodarian empire takes advantage of the astral to pmp ratio of 400,000 to 1 in at least a couple of ways.
finally, be aware it takes approximately 1,500 gp in cost to buy even one plane shift scroll, let alone the 3,000-gp cost for two (got to get back home, you know?).
the character is then different in three important ways: one, much of their old experiences and memories are long forgotten, leaving only rudimentary skills and basic skills such as language, certain social skills, and a relatively low level of any advanced education they may have had.
(as a quick aside, these people, and even retired adventurers, tend to forget anything they do not continuously practice; their experience may eventually drop to zero, but that is still 1st level.
a group of brave adventurers may sail into the point making the transition from the relatively warm imperial sea to a very chilly arctic like sea.
additional damage is done by one's prime requisite, as if it were strength on the strength table.
this has the effect of solitary confinement for centuries or even millennium while waiting only minutes or days on the pmp.
in reality, this rule probably was set in place as a game balancing force for lower level campaigns.
there, you can freely pass through the curtain into the associated border ethereal plane along that particular inner plane.
from our everyday experiences and lives we are, unfortunately, locked in a mindset that convinces each of us everything must have a past, a present, and a future.
the rules and laws of my universe are mine, and are therefore frequently different from the official written words from on high.
ultimately, this is a safer and quicker method of travel only when a single encounter roll is to be made because you know the path well, your guide knows it well, or you have hyper-accurate maps and information.
once released, the insane individual has a randomly determined alignment that is one of the results of being driven insane in that manner.
thus, if your character were to get out of a tough spot in a dm's world simply by your whim of leaving the universe, what you'd really be playing from that point on is, in my opinion, a false character since the real one probably died.
as such, interplanetary or even intergalactic distances can be achieved in the blink of a pmp eye.
in a similar fashion, i like the gods to remain obscure.
from the point of view of the astral individual, this is time that must really be waited out.
it's just a fact, as it turns out, your players are less inclined to even attempt to push you around if you don't give them total access to your thoughts by explaining yourself.
as it turns out, i have probably done just that; in fact, more often than going my own way.
so you see, the astral plane proper on my world is rarely used for anything other than travel from point a to point b on the pmp, or travel to various astral demi-planes or keeps, or to the outer planes of existence.
also, as the astral traveler approaches such a pool, like approaching a demi-plane, the time differential begins to drop.
let's face it, if it didn't make more sense, at least to me, i would have freely and quickly adopted the official written word and used it in my own universe.
other dms or gms control and make the rules for their own universes.
once inside the deep ethereal, you can seek out the proper curtain to one of the inner planes or to the pmp.
this is why i feel it is only with permission of your old dm that you may take a real character out of their universe; hopefully this dm understands his responsibility and will let you do this in practically all instances when your character is "safe" in "town" and you simply wish to play elsewhere; but even if he's a jerk and he improperly uses his power to "punish" you for leaving in this philosophical manner, you would still be playing a false character.
i should also mention, since it is extremely important, that most encounters and other experiences on the astral plane are actually sufficiently near a demi-plane, an astral pool of color, or even a creature.
that is, if he really wants to spend a couple days clawing through a thick wooden door, tell him you will resume playing next session, unless he can find a speedier method of entry.
i know for oil of etherealness that this always bounces you into the pmp somewhere.
this would make adventuring or living in the astral plane proper, a rather boring experience.
spells and most other consideration follow the guidelines given in themanual of the planes except where they violate my basic premises.
the ethereal plane is the other plane of existence which touches the pmp and which is also extensively used for travel.
thus, you could plane shift to the astral plane, adventure for 1,000 years, and return to the pmp where only a single day would have passed.
in it we can typically find their version of a prime material plane, the astral and ethereal planes, and the inner and outer planes.
such items are usually intelligent, wise, very powerful, or from other planes of existence to begin with.
if you do decide to use some of the equations, when it becomes very important in a particular situation, just remember to keep your units of measurement consistent throughout the equations.
closer to the same time as the pmp, these places are typically the homes of such races as the githyanki or the githzerai and are generally located outside,
i have, for example, a little known gate that opens when septer and folar eclipse when they are both in full phase.
one could travel from earth to earth's moon in just 10 hours or so.
after you've taken things into consideration and made your ruling, don't let anybody push you around.
still, this is mindless, repetitive work as opposed to creative work, and even then it takes extreme concentration not to lose your train of thought in the plane of thought.
to continue, upon the author's return to the pmp, the author couldn't even hope to fix his work for he would have no lasting memory of the work, the ideas which inspired it, or what he may have been thinking more than just a few astral months ago.
as time runs the same here as on the pmp, you would require rest and food at that time.
they may also travel to other planes touched by the astral plane, eventually returning to their demi-plane via the astral plane.
your local alchemist, and therefore your dm, has the final word on any such materials.
let's face it, if it didn't make more sense, at least to me, i would have freely and quickly adopted the official written word and used it in my own universe.
right away i didn't see the need for time to run differently, so it doesn't in my universe.
from our everyday experiences and lives we are, unfortunately, locked in a mindset that convinces each of us everything must have a past, a present, and a future.
the former usually just gives permission for the player to take his character with him when he stops playing, and the new dm certainly must grant permission for a player to play in his or her universe.
here, unlike the border ethereal, the ether cyclone is a normal possible encounter.
if he ever returned to fight again, a different roll would be made, but only after combat began.
(one to go ethereal and travel to where you wish to be, one to go pmp from that point and go adventuring on the pmp or inner plane, another to go ethereal again when you are finished in that location and so you may travel back home on the ethereal plane, and one more to go back to the pmp and home).
time is not constant everywhere, but even on the pmp alone time is positively warped.
then, you next pass through the curtain into the border ethereal plane.
his character should stoop to such an action only as an act of desperation or great need.
any change in the velocity of an object or person is mostly mentally achieved by an average of one's intelligence and wisdom rather than just their intelligence.
the number of encounter rolls is determined in the same manner as those in the astral plane.
he decides time is not a factor, the danger is little or nonexistent, and with a snap of our fingers the time has passed.
that is, i would never bring in a god on a whim or as a random encounter.
this happens once a year, during the spring equinox.
for example, the planet's position on a particular day may coincide with a particular color pool being in a particular position near a certain known point on the pmp.
you will therefore begin to tire, hunger, heal, learn, and age as you would if you were on the other connected plane.
thus, if your character were to get out of a tough spot in a dm's world simply by your whim of leaving the universe, what you'd really be playing from that point on is, in my opinion, a false character since the real one probably died.
the rules and laws of my universe are mine, and are therefore frequently different from the official written words from on high.
i don't have a problem with such things; so my world doesn't have a problem with such things.
it is likely you will leave the astral plane while such things are in short term memory (the spirit or soul).
naturally occurring vortices or nexus points may arise on the pmp to any of the inner planes, to different alternate planes, or to a different location on the pmp.
feedback is necessary and good, and asking your players what they think is vitally important.
one could travel from earth to earth's moon in just 10 hours or so.
the repetitive nature of the confinement is sufficient for the prisoner to remember their experience and to therefore drive the prisoner insane.
on my world, in my universe, this isn't a necessary balancing force; there are very good reasons to play either character class, and without orlantian historical reasons not to draw blood, it makes no sense to avoid doing so and much more sense that a cleric should use the weapon most often depicted or associated with their particular deity.
combat on the ethereal plane is tricky.
i imagine magic works differently on the astral plane than on the pmp and probably is similar to that which is stated in themanual of the planes.
you would really have to keep your mind occupied to prevent yourself from going insane while waiting centuries between encounters.
these may be permanent, temporary, or periodic nexus points.
as such, one day on orlantia would seem to be 400,000 days or 1,000 orlantian years on the astral plane.
this is why it is nearly impossible to go ethereal, travel pass a locked door in a dungeon, and come back to the pmp without greatly risking becoming substantial within some solid, material form (like a wall or a table) on the pmp.
it's just a fact, as it turns out, your players are less inclined to even attempt to push you around if you don't give them total access to your thoughts by explaining yourself.
traveling via ship would take weeks and this is too long.
i didn't particularly like the mode of travel in the inner planes.
for example, any adventurer would probably start out again as 1st level no matter how much experience they had to begin with.
still, this is mindless, repetitive work as opposed to creative work, and even then it takes extreme concentration not to lose your train of thought in the plane of thought.
due to the slower nature of the ethereal plane, as compared to the astral plane, the distances traveled are at best intraplanetary (point to point on the same planet) and hardly ever interplanetary (from one planet to another planet), let alone interstellar or intergalactic distances.
and because of my sense of reality and goals of consistency, hopefully my universe makes a kind of sense which is superior to the official world of ad&d.
in my campaigns i like to pretty much stay on the pmp.
if you luck out and manage to avoid any encounters in the deep ethereal, you may arrive at the adjacent ethereal curtain to katana.
after all, it is not up to you or your pc to dictate what the properties of the universe will be.
so it would take me 400,000 times longer to learn a language, a song, a story, or other similar experience and no real advantage is gained.
what is happening is really a reflection of the spirit more than a reflection of the body.
there is an unseen wind in the border ethereal whose velocity is randomly determined.
and i don't even want to start in on the fact that certain standard spells already mess around with gravity as well as time, thus the initial premise of the manual of the planes is faulty on its face.
all magic items are reduced by one plus.
therefore, time may easily run differently when you are on different planes of existence.
usually, adventurers may travel to the proper pool if they have done so before, are guided by an astral native, or have a map of some sort.
for example, an author might decide he could go to the astral plane, compose great original work after great original work, and return with centuries of work before the very next pmp day had started.
also, it is a fact the minds in the truestone artifact are not technically living (and certainly not chemically based).
now if you look out into and through the colored pool it is possible, provided there is sufficient light on the connected plane, to see certain aspects on that plane.
the exceptions are huge concentrations of metal ores, thick sheets of more refine metals, and the living material of most creatures found in the monstrous manual as they generate a sufficient aura of energy which ethereal matter cannot pass though.
you may then travel along the border ethereal until you find what you seek.
this is why it is nearly impossible to go ethereal, travel pass a locked door in a dungeon, and come back to the pmp without greatly risking becoming substantial within some solid, material form (like a wall or a table) on the pmp.
other planes may be accessed with aplane shift spell if they first get closer.
in the meantime, the possibility the gods i use on my world and the gods of classical mythology, as well as other mythologies, may have had an influence on historical earth and therefore be one and the same gods is still open.
it is these rare, but few and far between events that give you the little experience your dm awards you upon your leaving the astral plane.
the plane shift spell is the favorite method of travel between the planes.
it is easiest to enter these planes from the ethereal plane by passing through the correct color ethereal curtain.
in addition to this, any training cost would be a mere 1/10th of the normal training cost and take only 1 day per level to relearn their old skills).
i believe, at one time, e. gary gygax himself took such a stand, foolishly reserving the right of "last word" creativity in any ad&d system for himself.
eventually, one would reach their terminal velocity.
due to the slower nature of the ethereal plane, as compared to the astral plane, the distances traveled are at best intraplanetary (point to point on the same planet) and hardly ever interplanetary (from one planet to another planet), let alone interstellar or intergalactic distances.
any change in the velocity of an object or person is mostly mentally achieved by an average of one's intelligence and wisdom rather than just their intelligence.
also, short-term memories are retained as opposed to long term memories.
thus, gravity from 0 to 3 gs is possible, though almost all wizards use their home planet's value of g so they feel at home and do not have to make adjustments when they travel to and fro.
if the ethereal cyclone gets you, you can say a prayer over the graves of your friends later, provided you survive.
here, unlike the border ethereal, the ether cyclone is a normal possible encounter.
the inner planes may be, of course, useful for an adventure or two every now and then.
for example, entering earth would kill you if you couldn't freely move through or breath earth; entering water would probably drown you; entering fire would almost certainly burn you to death; entering air, on the other hand, would be reasonably safe.
you could go to the curtain of one of the other inner planes from here, but your friends are counting on you so you stay near the curtain to the pmp.
if no particular weapon readily comes to mind for a given deity, the cleric should feel free to use any weapon of their choice, including a sword or other edged weapon.
this would take you to the border ethereal plane for that particular inner plane.
thus, +3 to hit, +8 to damage is the maximum bonus.
such items are usually intelligent, wise, very powerful, or from other planes of existence to begin with.
in themanual of the planes, grubb also had a note of "last word" finality to much of his writing.
this would only be done if it were so much shorter the party decides to risk it.
from there, one can plane shift down to the adjacent inner plane.
if you are even further away, the trip is still possible since you have a rough idea of where these things may be; but several extra encounter rolls would then be typical no matter
as such, it is true the ethereal and astral planes frequently come into play.
a heal spell, also by a self charging magic item called a lavender pearl, and therefore inexpensive, cures the insanity, but not the new alignment.
i didn't particularly like the mode of travel in the inner planes.
this happens once a year, during the spring equinox.
a wizard's astral castle, large enough to generate its own pocket of slower moving relative time, would be a prime example of an artificial astral demi-plane.
there, you can freely pass through the curtain into the associated border ethereal plane along that particular inner plane.
let's face it, the astral plane's primary useful purpose is to travel great distances in a short amount of pmp time.
your local alchemist, and therefore your dm, has the final word on any such materials.
eventually, when close enough to the pool or demi-plane, time is running there at the same rate that it is running on that other connected plane.
personally, i don't think so, so if they end up stunned in the deep ether, when they do recover they will be stranded on the ethereal plane until they either employ plane shifting magic or find a naturally occurring pool of some kind.
it would only be with the continuous and repeated study of the same things again and again over a period of 400,000 astral days that you may eventually hope to remember any language or other complex time consuming study or training you learned while on the astral plane.
time also acts differently under extremely strong gravitational fields such as near a neutron star or close to the event horizon of a black hole.
you'd best get back to the border ethereal or the pmp relatively soon, least the experience fade from your short term memory.
as such, one day on orlantia would seem to be 400,000 days or 1,000 orlantian years on the astral plane.
using a plane shift, the party moves into the border ethereal plane near alodar.
this doesn't take into account the hours of back breaking work, the blisters and splinters, and the aching knees and joints which would result from such an endeavor and naturally make one reluctant to do it at all; to say nothing of ruining a perfectly good spoon.
in fact, it is exploring these differences which can enliven one's adventuring and gaming experiences.
normal ethereal materials affect each other only slightly.
or, if not safe, from whence one could return if properly protected before one went there, and if you didn't remain too long.
short-term memory is also a partial explanation for why much of the xp. carries over and stays with you.
you are only likely to remember what ever happened to you during the last few hours, or perhaps the last few days of apparent astral time.
(traveling via a plane shift through the astral plane may be slightly quicker, though a little more dangerous as nastier things tend to live on the astral plane).
as an example, a nexus point to the paraelemental plane of ice may be found in the permanently frozen wastelands of the polar regions.
one useful property of the astral plane is that the speed of light is not a limiting factor, and distances between points are not as specific as one might think.
personally, i don't think so, so if they end up stunned in the deep ether, when they do recover they will be stranded on the ethereal plane until they either employ plane shifting magic or find a naturally occurring pool of some kind.
short-term memories are partially retained in a more spiritual manner within the spirit or soul.
it may therefore be the reason your dreams make sense at the time, but upon reflection in the morning, they are utter nonsense.
it is vast and useful, as well as educational and interesting.
that is, if he got himself in a mess of trouble the pc doesn't automatically have the power to leave the universe to avoid it and save his character.
since this is in the near or border ethereal only one encounter roll would be made.
just avoid dms who are jerks whenever possible.
so in both their system and my system, each individual ages a single day for 1,000 years on the astral plane.
the old dm usually must give their permission simply because i believe it is important not to allow a player to circumvent a world's dangers just on a whim.
if the arrows are still magic, they will do normal base damage plus their lower bonus damage.
of course what usually happens is something native to such a plane takes the brief opportunity to come onto the pmp, giving any such convenient party something to deal with.
during such time you would have aged only a single day, pmp poisons would have the effect of having been in your system but a single day, you would seem to be fatigued by but a single day, and a host of other similar effects.
these astral demi-planes are sometimes artificial, but usually they are naturally occurring, such as a large chunk of earth floating like an island in astral space.
for example, any adventurer would probably start out again as 1st level no matter how much experience they had to begin with.
(i imagine the success or failure would be a direct function of one's intelligence and/or wisdom).
the entire astral plane glows of magic and appears to be well illuminated in a dull gray kind of way.
at least, insofar as my players and their pcs can gain access to them.
keep in mind, though, that only a few encounters, if any at all, would be likely to occur during even an apparent 1,000 year stint in the astral plane and most people do not spend that kind of time out there in the first place.
as such, interplanetary or even intergalactic distances can be achieved in the blink of a pmp eye.
each and every time i come across such arrogant behavior i simply cringe.
these places, akin to the border ethereal, are tied to their near non-astral places in such a way that any adventuring done there could be treated, for memory, experience, healing, fatigue, poisons, and other purposes, as if it occurred on that associated non-astral plane.
the natural chemical bonds set up in the brain that create our long term memories are also slowed down by that 400,000 to 1 factor, just like all other metabolic functions.
anotherplane shift spell will take you into that inner plane.
since this is in the near or border ethereal only one encounter roll would be made.
if not, they do no damage.
they also add to your plus to hit rolls for missile or thrown weapons, but only at short range.
gas attacks are less effective as the pcs can survive without air for up to 10 times longer in the border ethereal and 100 times longer in the deep ethereal.
suffice it to say i have no more desire to include the outer planes in my world than i have to include the gods actively adventuring with the pcs.
other protection devices such as bracers of defense, cloaks of protection, rings of protection, etc., either are reduced by 1 plus or are reduced by 1 or more ac advantage points by your dm.
specifically, on orlantia where there are 400 days in a year, the ratio is 400,000 to 1.
in the meantime, you would be subjected to 1,000 astral years of encounter rolls or run the risk of death over what would seem to be a great period of time.
also, it is a fact the minds in the truestone artifact are not technically living (and certainly not chemically based).
suffice it to say, all creatures which normally might be considered native to the astral plane could, in some way, travel astrally as a native ability or by magic commonly available to them.
you will therefore begin to tire, hunger, heal, learn, and age as you would if you were on the other connected plane.
only extraordinary, probably life threatening events and circumstances, frequently involving other intelligent beings on the astral plane, will ultimately end up staying with you; and even then, only in some small way.
specifically, on orlantia where there are 400 days in a year, the ratio is 400,000 to 1.
if the weapons or armor are still magical, they work as normal at their reduced levels.
whatever the dm wishes the dm can create.
by temporarily becoming astral, moving the desired distance and direction while the mind is shut down or in a state of protected suspension, and popping back to the pmp in the desired location, these spells move small objects from point a to point b quicker than any other known method of travel.
one useful property of the astral plane is that the speed of light is not a limiting factor, and distances between points are not as specific as one might think.
that is, the xp. normally stated for astral goodies are awarded at that time.
you may travel in any direction desired by simply thinking it.
this bonus is not to exceed the bonus for a score of 20 or higher for pcs.
until it does, however, it can drown you.
if you travel via the border ethereal plane, the wizard will almost certainly kill your friends in katana before you'd arrive to stop him.
naturally, you'd have to find a way to write with ink in an environment with no gravity, but this could be done with a little thought.
of course, the evil wizard arrived in katana almost one turn, or 10 minutes, before you did (teleportation in the blink of an eye, you know?).
only extraordinary, probably life threatening events and circumstances, frequently involving other intelligent beings on the astral plane, will ultimately end up staying with you; and even then, only in some small way.
in fact, it is exploring these differences which can enliven one's adventuring and gaming experiences.
after all, food, water, sleep, and other things, which would normally necessitate moving around, are not required in such a situation.
as such, they are released into alodarian society, hopefully to sin no more.
i usually have the party go there on some specific quest.
from there, they may travel to a frozen glacial covered land where they may find the pools of liquid nitrogen.
teleportation, dimension door, and other similar spells utilize these properties to their advantage.
naturally, the encounters in such a place would be few and far between, and mostly of creatures native to the astral plane, so even over a 1,000 years there might be only several such instances, if even that many.
time spent on the astral plane seems almost instantaneous from the point of view of a pmp observer.
thus, gravity from 0 to 3 gs is possible, though almost all wizards use their home planet's value of g so they feel at home and do not have to make adjustments when they travel to and fro.
gravity mostly depends on sheer mass and the distance between the center of mass for the bulk of it and the object in question (normally you).
the 400,000 to 1 ratio does lend great speed to the information storage and retrieval properties of the empire.
such considerations will subtract one encounter roll, not to be less than one per trip in any event, but will slow your speed from 10,000x to 1,000x your normal pmp movement rate.
this wind makes things on the pmp, when an ethereal creature can see them, appear to be in a different location from their real location.
in this way the natives can travel within the astral plane and their demi-plane.
you'd then walk into katana.
you could go to the curtain of one of the other inner planes from here, but your friends are counting on you so you stay near the curtain to the pmp.
everything on the pmp could be given the 3 coordinates of length, width, and height.
the alodarian empire takes advantage of the astral to pmp ratio of 400,000 to 1 in at least a couple of ways.
as such, a cleric of thor will use a hammer, but a cleric of poseidon would almost certainly use a trident, while a cleric of athena might use a spear or a sword.
of course, being close to the 113th day, or close to the old well, is probably good enough provided you go through the extra astral travel and any resulting extra encounter rolls.
naturally, you'd have to find a way to write with ink in an environment with no gravity, but this could be done with a little thought.
of course, survival within one of these inner planes may be problematic.
if he ever returned to fight again, a different roll would be made, but only after combat began.
for example, the notion that a cleric, like some of their historical christian counter parts on earth, didn't like to draw blood and therefore were restricted to the use of specific non-edged weapons.
also, one day on the astral plane near earth would seem to be 365,250 days or 1,000 earth years on the astral plane.
that is, on the 113th day of the year, if you plane shift to the astral plane from the old well in farmer brown's north field, you will immediately come across the color pool to the elemental plane of water which leads to the "undersea" city of ariel on the elemental plane of water.
now the dm is obligated to instantly create 1,000 years of history and social evolution.
larger occurring natural demi-planes also have the slower moving time.
you can't even spend that time learning new languages, learning stories or songs, or doing anything you would normally consider advantageous.
that is, if you have a 12" rate, you could normally travel 24 miles on the pmp in 10 hours, or 240 miles in the border ethereal in 10 hours.
creativity is also a chemical process of the brain.
once released, the insane individual has a randomly determined alignment that is one of the results of being driven insane in that manner.
if the ethereal cyclone gets you, you can say a prayer over the graves of your friends later, provided you survive.
naturally, one can see why the official word from on high might wish to avoid even these simple equations, as they wouldn't want a certain level of physics or mathematics to be a prerequisite to playing ad&d.
as such, it is possible for ethereal creatures to even see, though vaguely, objects on the pmp; even then only when there is sufficient illumination on the pmp.
i would use the outer planes for the same purpose, but with less frequency, and only for more powerful groups.
the color of the pool is a good indication of the plane it connects to, but not the location in that plane.
furthermore, with extended periods of time on the astral plane in my universe, there is a lack of cohesion and focus; also a lack of determination of purpose.
other protection devices such as bracers of defense, cloaks of protection, rings of protection, etc., either are reduced by 1 plus or are reduced by 1 or more ac advantage points by your dm.
feedback is necessary and good, and asking your players what they think is vitally important.
a normal +4 pmp long sword would work as well on the ethereal plane since it would act as a +3 sword there.
to continue, upon the author's return to the pmp, the author couldn't even hope to fix his work for he would have no lasting memory of the work, the ideas which inspired it, or what he may have been thinking more than just a few astral months ago.
all magic items are reduced by one plus.
this is how gravity works on the pmp, which is, you may recall, just one large example of a demi-plane.
these may be permanent, temporary, or periodic nexus points.
for example, taking a book along with you to copy on the astral plane, as well as ink and parchment, would allow one to take advantage of several hundred hours of work on the astral plane while only a few seconds or minutes of pmp time may have elapsed.
the minds within the artifact are not affected in the same manner as other living minds on the astral plane.
natural weapons such as hands, feet, claws, and teeth still do normal damage.
the closer they get the closer to pmp or other planar time they also get.
it is vast and useful, as well as educational and interesting.
that is, if he got himself in a mess of trouble the pc doesn't automatically have the power to leave the universe to avoid it and save his character.
for example, the nexus point to the paraelemental plane of ice that occurs every eighteen years always opens up in the same place on the surface of the imperial sea and stays open for one folar (10 days).
using a plane shift, the party moves into the border ethereal plane near alodar.
your speed is 100 times your normal pmp movement rate.
if you luck out and manage to avoid any encounters in the deep ethereal, you may arrive at the adjacent ethereal curtain to katana.
you are only likely to remember what ever happened to you during the last few hours, or perhaps the last few days of apparent astral time.
it too would have an effect on time, and thus what we consider normal time flow would be an aspect of the same phenomenon that causes time to run more slowly near any demi-plane).
potion duration are similar to spell duration, since in my universe potions simply impart the ability to immediately cast a similar spell as a natural effect, and are not necessarily a slow metabolic time released capsule kind of deal which the official word seems to think they are.
this has the advantage of drawing on the creativity and hard work of others, and gives a broader scope to my ad&d universe.
after months of work in such a relatively secure place, the wizard could return to the pmp where, yes, the same number of months had also passed since time runs in both places at a similar rate.
one example, however, might be gorgon blood mixed with mortar.
any pluses left are still used to hit, damage, save, or protect as normal.
this periodic pattern would depend entirely on the type of nexus point and its location.
to get to the first layer of an outer plane using plane shift, you must first plane shift to the astral plane where you can then travel to the proper pool or plane shift directly to the outer plane if you have the proper tuning fork.
once there, the short-term spiritual memories have time to become long-term chemical memories, and you may remember or forget them, depending on how good your character's long-term memory really is.
it is because of this wind that ethereal travelers are unable to achieve pinpoint accuracy when traveling back to the pmp, always being off by a random distance in a random direction up to several hundred feet "indoors" and several hundred yards "outdoors."
so in both their system and my system, each individual ages a single day for 1,000 years on the astral plane.
as creatures of the pmp, you are tied to it in a very real way.
such a cell constructed with this material would probably keep an individual from plane shifting out of there or anybody from plane shifting into the cell as well.
it turns out the periodic motion of the orbit of the planet may open such a nexus once a year as the point passes through the right conditions on the ethereal or astral planes.
(traveling via a plane shift through the astral plane may be slightly quicker, though a little more dangerous as nastier things tend to live on the astral plane).
travel while confined to the border ethereal plane is relatively safe.
for example, a man with an 18 intelligence and a 12 wisdom would have an acceleration of up to 15 ft/sec^2.
first, the truestone artifact is physically kept there.
this would take you to the border ethereal plane for that particular inner plane.
as it turns out, a naturally occurring resonance arises between large orbiting bodies of sufficient mass and that portion of the astral plane associated with the orbit of these bodies and the associated singularity or central star.
in reality, this rule probably was set in place as a game balancing force for lower level campaigns.
you next pass through the ethereal curtain into the deep ethereal plane.
from there, they may travel to a frozen glacial covered land where they may find the pools of liquid nitrogen.
here, in the border ethereal, the ether cyclone is not a normal possibility.
as such, years of astral study would not be burnt into the memory pathways of your brain, but only the last few hours might be actively retained (unless you study the same thing repeatedly, again and again and again and.).
for example, an author might decide he could go to the astral plane, compose great original work after great original work, and return with centuries of work before the very next pmp day had started.
so, if you can avoid it, don't do it.
now the dm is obligated to instantly create 1,000 years of history and social evolution.
there is, in fact, a good chance that such a copied work would contain flaws that went unnoticed until your return to the pmp.
some of the creatures that are actually native to the astral plane proper generate a type of natural field around themselves which is similar to the same sort of field generated around the astral demi-planes.
all places on the pmp touch the near, or border ethereal plane.
this is probably because they wish to avoid even simple equations of motion involving accelerations.
such a roll would, however, only be revealed to the player after combat began.
a wizard's astral castle, large enough to generate its own pocket of slower moving relative time, would be a prime example of an artificial astral demi-plane.
since there was no time "before" the big bang, and also no elsewhere for the universe to come from, we can see we are hopelessly trying to fit a real, but unique non-everyday situation into the mind set of our everyday frame of reality; but not everything has a past, a present, or a future.
it turns out the periodic motion of the orbit of the planet may open such a nexus once a year as the point passes through the right conditions on the ethereal or astral planes.
travel within the grayish fog of the deep ethereal is quicker than the border ethereal.
suffice it to say that a savvy wizard could adjust a few things such that his astral castle could have virtually any amount of gravity he wanted if he didn't go to extremes.
upon returning to the pmp, any extraordinary or recent experience gained there is adjusted by the dm to account for the natural factors involved in such a dimension.
potion duration are similar to spell duration, since in my universe potions simply impart the ability to immediately cast a similar spell as a natural effect, and are not necessarily a slow metabolic time released capsule kind of deal which the official word seems to think they are.
you may then travel along the border ethereal until you find what you seek.
but that is no reason to be saddled with a very generalized rule based on a religion which itself didn't make the transition.
that is, if he really wants to spend a couple days clawing through a thick wooden door, tell him you will resume playing next session, unless he can find a speedier method of entry.
e.g., an 18 intelligence for a magic user would be +1 to hit, +2 to damage.
so it would take me 400,000 times longer to learn a language, a song, a story, or other similar experience and no real advantage is gained.
it may therefore be the reason your dreams make sense at the time, but upon reflection in the morning, they are utter nonsense.
long term memories are more chemical in nature, or at least have a definite chemical component.
note that this implies there is breathable air on the ethereal plane (or some such thing that functions tin a similar way).
typical examples of terminal velocities might be 100 feet/second in air, 10 feet/second in water, 1,000 feet/second in fire, and 0 feet/second in earth.
since it is a fact our pcs tend to migrate from universe to universe, or from one dm's world to another dm's world, it is always nice to have gross similarities between universes.
of course, the evil wizard arrived in katana almost one turn, or 10 minutes, before you did (teleportation in the blink of an eye, you know?).
it too would have an effect on time, and thus what we consider normal time flow would be an aspect of the same phenomenon that causes time to run more slowly near any demi-plane).
teleportation, dimension door, and other similar spells utilize these properties to their advantage.
by temporarily becoming astral, moving the desired distance and direction while the mind is shut down or in a state of protected suspension, and popping back to the pmp in the desired location, these spells move small objects from point a to point b quicker than any other known method of travel.
as such, years of astral study would not be burnt into the memory pathways of your brain, but only the last few hours might be actively retained (unless you study the same thing repeatedly, again and again and again and.).
of course this leads me to wonder about the development of magic, the different kinds of abilities and limitations of magic, and what magic really is, anyway.
this plane has no true up or down, and gravity does not function here at all, which is another reason why it is hard to write with quill and ink on the astral plane, but may act normally in a demi-plane.
this is probably because they wish to avoid even simple equations of motion involving accelerations.
from there, you get your bearings and travel a short distance to katana.
it is also a fact that, due to the nature of energy, magic, one's mind, and a few other considerations, a magic user couldn't write scroll after scroll on the astral plane proper, and expect to return home with months of completed, useful work in just a few pmp minutes.
i know for oil of etherealness that this always bounces you into the pmp somewhere.
provided no encounters happened, you could then shift down to the pmp and find yourself up to several hundred yards off target.
under such considerations, it is impossible to take advantage of thousands of years of adventuring, gaining treasure, magic, and experience, and finally returning to the pmp dozens if not hundreds of levels higher than you were just a few pmp days before.
it was discovered one could do this by enveloping oneself in a kind of mental field (usually achieved through meditative states).
such nexus points may only last long enough for a party, which just happens to be in the vicinity, to travel through before forever closing.
traveling to katana will require at least three encounter rolls since you've never made this trip before via the deep ethereal plane.
from there, one can plane shift down to the adjacent inner plane.
they may also travel to other planes touched by the astral plane, eventually returning to their demi-plane via the astral plane.
magic bows impart one less plus to their missiles, so the arrows are only magic if they were shot from at least a +2 (therefore now a +1) bow, or the arrows were at least +2 (therefore now a +1) to begin with.
so, if you can avoid it, don't do it.
e.g., a +3 ethereal long sword.
it is a fact that in my universe certain astral coordinates, as well as the coordinates of other planes, are fixed to a reference system using the central star of a particular solar system.
if the arrows are still magic, they will do normal base damage plus their lower bonus damage.
thus, without the aid of additional magic, one's acceleration is up to one half of their combined intelligence and wisdom in ft/sec^2.
after you've taken things into consideration and made your ruling, don't let anybody push you around.
entering into the +mp or the -mp would be almost instant death.
the number of encounter rolls is determined in the same manner as those in the astral plane.
usually i won't even do that but will instead send a representative of the deity.
copying a book is not something a pc is likely to get into the habit of doing because it is both boring and uninspired, lengthy, tedious work.
also, periodic nexus points have very regular duration so you may rely on them.
therefore, if you really wish, simply use your terminal velocities as the normal traveling speeds of your pcs.
of course the outer planes do exist, as well as the gods, and are an ever-present reminder of the powers that be.
as such, i have always praised any language or any rules in the official system which explicitly or implicitly state your universe should ultimately be run under your rules, and anything the books say should be construed simply as guide lines.
in fact, anything the dm cares to put in their universe is within their control alone and makes up what will ultimately be known as their ad&d universe.
convicted criminals of certain crimes, which might normally be considered capital crimes, are held in a sensory depravation area on the astral plane with the aid of a self-charging magic item.
i would use the outer planes for the same purpose, but with less frequency, and only for more powerful groups.
each and every time i come across such arrogant behavior i simply cringe.
combat in the border ethereal is identical to combat in the deep ethereal except for the time differential problems of short-term memory.
now because of the slow chemical learning, if it would take a year to learn elvish on the pmp, it would take 400,000 years of continuous and repeated study on the astral plane to burn that language into my memory.
it is possible to take one's time and be more careful.
you may remember learning alderami, but like someone who hasn't used a skill or language for years or decades, you've completely forgotten any useful working knowledge of those few astral years of study.
this item would be +2 to hit and +2 to damage on the pmp, but on the ethereal plane it is +3, +3.
most astral creatures are not really native to the astral plane.
this is how gravity works on the pmp, which is, you may recall, just one large example of a demi-plane.
there is an unseen wind in the border ethereal whose velocity is randomly determined.
this gate opens up onto the far side of septer and stays open for one day.
if the ethereal traveler accidentally attempts to enter the pmp at a point of solid matter, they may take damage, or perhaps make a save vs. death, or perhaps they will simply be stunned and displaced to the nearest available open space on the pmp, or even end up stunned and back in the deep ethereal plane.
a group of brave adventurers may sail into the point making the transition from the relatively warm imperial sea to a very chilly arctic like sea.
in the meantime, you would be subjected to 1,000 astral years of encounter rolls or run the risk of death over what would seem to be a great period of time.
even 10 years into the future could have interesting results.
in themanual of the planes, grubb also had a note of "last word" finality to much of his writing.
copying a book is not something a pc is likely to get into the habit of doing because it is both boring and uninspired, lengthy, tedious work.
another way the empire takes advantage of the time differential is in a type of punishment employed in their justice system.
this plane has no true up or down, and gravity does not function here at all, which is another reason why it is hard to write with quill and ink on the astral plane, but may act normally in a demi-plane.
the character is then different in three important ways: one, much of their old experiences and memories are long forgotten, leaving only rudimentary skills and basic skills such as language, certain social skills, and a relatively low level of any advanced education they may have had.
such a cell constructed with this material would probably keep an individual from plane shifting out of there or anybody from plane shifting into the cell as well.
it is because of this wind that ethereal travelers are unable to achieve pinpoint accuracy when traveling back to the pmp, always being off by a random distance in a random direction up to several hundred feet "indoors" and several hundred yards "outdoors."
now because of the slow chemical learning, if it would take a year to learn elvish on the pmp, it would take 400,000 years of continuous and repeated study on the astral plane to burn that language into my memory.
of course this leads me to wonder about the development of magic, the different kinds of abilities and limitations of magic, and what magic really is, anyway.
after months of work in such a relatively secure place, the wizard could return to the pmp where, yes, the same number of months had also passed since time runs in both places at a similar rate.
such nexus points may only last long enough for a party, which just happens to be in the vicinity, to travel through before forever closing.
in this way, one needn't consider possible disastrous results that would inevitably arise from different races on different planes taking full advantage of unforeseen factors resulting from the time differential between planes.
quite simply, this is where the ethereal plane is most closely tied to the pmp.
the relativistic effects of time actually become noticeable when achieving speeds of about 1/10th the speed of light or greater.
it is practically a death sentence to enter most of these planes without the proper preparations.
the color of the pool is a good indication of the plane it connects to, but not the location in that plane.
it's always easy for a player to proclaim their pcs are perfectly willing to endure considerable hardships, great amounts of pain and anguish, untold suffering, or even wait seemingly endless amounts of boring time to achieve even the littlest of goals.
as they have it, time runs the same on each plane, but there is some sort of relative time factor involved where, coincidentally, an individual on the astral plane would only age 1 day after spending 1,000 years on the astral plane.
some of the creatures that are actually native to the astral plane proper generate a type of natural field around themselves which is similar to the same sort of field generated around the astral demi-planes.
a normal +4 pmp long sword would work as well on the ethereal plane since it would act as a +3 sword there.
(a normally +1 bow shooting a normally +1 arrow is now +0 since the -1 penalty applies to each item, and such an arrow will do no damage).
as such, it is possible for ethereal creatures to even see, though vaguely, objects on the pmp; even then only when there is sufficient illumination on the pmp.
(if a player still insists on trying to do something like this when you feel he should try other, more obvious methods besides brute force, perhaps suggesting a halt to the game until next session may make him think otherwise.
keep in mind, though, that only a few encounters, if any at all, would be likely to occur during even an apparent 1,000 year stint in the astral plane and most people do not spend that kind of time out there in the first place.
keeping the players from knowing too much about the outer planes, the gods, or even the after life is one's best defense against their trying to take advantage of the weak links in one's armor.
also, some now dead material of once living creatures that had various ethereal properties may be employed as a method of blocking ethereal matter from transit.
if the weapons or armor are still magical, they work as normal at their reduced levels.
here's a lively little example: your party wishes to quickly get to the capital city of katana on the northern continent.
as they have it, time runs the same on each plane, but there is some sort of relative time factor involved where, coincidentally, an individual on the astral plane would only age 1 day after spending 1,000 years on the astral plane.
traveling to katana will require at least three encounter rolls since you've never made this trip before via the deep ethereal plane.
weapon specialization bonuses to hit and to damage are still used.
and i don't even want to start in on the fact that certain standard spells already mess around with gravity as well as time, thus the initial premise of the manual of the planes is faulty on its face.
(as a quick aside, these people, and even retired adventurers, tend to forget anything they do not continuously practice; their experience may eventually drop to zero, but that is still 1st level.
all of these places happen to be running sufficiently close to the real pmp time; so they will not make much of a difference.
or better yet, an acceleration formula as a function of one's intelligence and wisdom.
at least, insofar as my players and their pcs can gain access to them.
naturally occurring vortices or nexus points may arise on the pmp to any of the inner planes, to different alternate planes, or to a different location on the pmp.
if not, they do no damage.
for example, you have to rest, study, or pray 400,000 times longer to get your spells back, to naturally heal, to accumulate life force or experience, or in many other ways, to get anything worthwhile done on that plane.
if they are non-magical, they do zero points of damage for weapons or provide no protection for armor.
i should also mention, since it is extremely important, that most encounters and other experiences on the astral plane are actually sufficiently near a demi-plane, an astral pool of color, or even a creature.
if greater distances are required, and time is of the essence, one can travel from the border ethereal through the ethereal curtain into the deep ethereal.
the 400,000 to 1 ratio does lend great speed to the information storage and retrieval properties of the empire.
in any event, missiles will eventually come to a stop and drift in the ethereal fog until found and taken.
as such, i have always praised any language or any rules in the official system which explicitly or implicitly state your universe should ultimately be run under your rules, and anything the books say should be construed simply as guide lines.
provided no encounters happened, you could then shift down to the pmp and find yourself up to several hundred yards off target.
it was discovered one could do this by enveloping oneself in a kind of mental field (usually achieved through meditative states).
the minds within the artifact are not affected in the same manner as other living minds on the astral plane.
medium ranges can only be achieved with magic arrows (remember the -2 penalty).
whatever the dm wishes the dm can create.
and three, they are left with such a horrible memory of the punishment that, no matter what their new alignment, they'll do almost anything, even frequently including suicide, to avoid that kind of punishment again.
he decides time is not a factor, the danger is little or nonexistent, and with a snap of our fingers the time has passed.
all that work would be lost.
the government isn't trying to change their alignment to something more acceptable, but the change is just a consequence of this type of punishment.
time spent on the astral plane seems almost instantaneous from the point of view of a pmp observer.
suffice it to say i have no more desire to include the outer planes in my world than i have to include the gods actively adventuring with the pcs.
while in an ethereal state, one can pass freely though most things on the pmp without notice or harm.
and because of my sense of reality and goals of consistency, hopefully my universe makes a kind of sense which is superior to the official world of ad&d.
magic bows impart one less plus to their missiles, so the arrows are only magic if they were shot from at least a +2 (therefore now a +1) bow, or the arrows were at least +2 (therefore now a +1) to begin with.
thus, without the aid of additional magic, one's acceleration is up to one half of their combined intelligence and wisdom in ft/sec^2.
thus, in order to take a one way trip into the future and avoid any pmp enemies or escape justice or whatever other things would change in 1,000 years, your group simply slips onto the astral plane, mindlessly states they will wait it out in their secure metal box far from any world or any dangers, snaps their fingers, and returns home.
but that is no reason to be saddled with a very generalized rule based on a religion which itself didn't make the transition.
in fact, anything the dm cares to put in their universe is within their control alone and makes up what will ultimately be known as their ad&d universe.
for example, the planet's position on a particular day may coincide with a particular color pool being in a particular position near a certain known point on the pmp.
quite simply, this is where the ethereal plane is most closely tied to the pmp.
in addition to this, any training cost would be a mere 1/10th of the normal training cost and take only 1 day per level to relearn their old skills).
therefore, if you really wish, simply use your terminal velocities as the normal traveling speeds of your pcs.
finally, it is through the astral plane, a quirk in the astral plane, or typically by some unexpected phenomenon of the astral plane, that a pc manages to accidentally or intentionally end up in an entirely different universe by permission of his or her old and new dungeon masters alike.
as it turns out, a naturally occurring resonance arises between large orbiting bodies of sufficient mass and that portion of the astral plane associated with the orbit of these bodies and the associated singularity or central star.
here's a lively little example: your party wishes to quickly get to the capital city of katana on the northern continent.
for example, taking a book along with you to copy on the astral plane, as well as ink and parchment, would allow one to take advantage of several hundred hours of work on the astral plane while only a few seconds or minutes of pmp time may have elapsed.
by visualizing the desired destination, coupled with the previous knowledge, the native's help, or the map, the party can travel to it with 1, 2, or 3 encounter rolls, depending on how well they know the path already, how well the native knows the path, or the accuracy of the map.
another example would be a nexus to the elemental plane of fire inside the heart of an active volcano.
they also add to your plus to hit rolls for missile or thrown weapons, but only at short range.
you may not travel back to the astral plane without employing additional magic such as anotherplane shift spell.
while astral, much of what was written in themanual of the planes may or may not apply as the situation demands.
thus, a round trip would require fourplane shift spells and the proper two sets of tuning forks.
the former usually just gives permission for the player to take his character with him when he stops playing, and the new dm certainly must grant permission for a player to play in his or her universe.
while astral, much of what was written in themanual of the planes may or may not apply as the situation demands.
i like the general business of reducing magic pluses of weapons and armor by one for each plane removed from its intended plane.
of course, they may be great places that have nothing to do with death but only something to do with the inability to travel back home.
it is a fact that in my universe certain astral coordinates, as well as the coordinates of other planes, are fixed to a reference system using the central star of a particular solar system.
things that seem to make perfect sense on the astral plane when examined in the cold hard light of the pmp would seem to be utter rubbish.
this would be like traveling at 10,000 times your normal movement rate or about 240,000 miles in ten hours (making the top deep ethereal travel speed about 24,000 mph).
if you could change that number, you'd be on another plane.
of course, they may be great places that have nothing to do with death but only something to do with the inability to travel back home.
this periodic pattern would depend entirely on the type of nexus point and its location.
permanent nexus points usually arise where there are permanent conditions sufficient to bridge the gap between the pmp in tendril space and another plane of existence.
note that this implies there is breathable air on the ethereal plane (or some such thing that functions tin a similar way).
as such, they are released into alodarian society, hopefully to sin no more.
this would make adventuring or living in the astral plane proper, a rather boring experience.
there is, in fact, a good chance that such a copied work would contain flaws that went unnoticed until your return to the pmp.
thus, you could plane shift to the astral plane, adventure for 1,000 years, and return to the pmp where only a single day would have passed.
even at this speed of 10x the border ethereal speed it is possible to get most places on orlantia in just under one hour, provided you have no encounters or other problems along the way.
suffice it to say that a savvy wizard could adjust a few things such that his astral castle could have virtually any amount of gravity he wanted if he didn't go to extremes.
permanent nexus points usually arise where there are permanent conditions sufficient to bridge the gap between the pmp in tendril space and another plane of existence.
ethereal creatures can be seen here by people on the pmp if they employ magic such as detect invisibility, or under just the right conditions.
even 10 years into the future could have interesting results.
for example, a pc tells me he is willing to scratch through a strong wooden door with his spoon even after i inform him it will take several days to do such a thing.
such considerations will subtract one encounter roll, not to be less than one per trip in any event, but will slow your speed from 10,000x to 1,000x your normal pmp movement rate.
relatively secure in the astral plane in such a place, since the time is so similar to the time on the pmp, a wizard could learn spells, do spell research, create magic items and scrolls, and other normal activities as their body is functioning in a normal time stream.
as such, these creatures would only be seen near orlantia if they actively traveled astrally toward, or to it.
if the ethereal traveler accidentally attempts to enter the pmp at a point of solid matter, they may take damage, or perhaps make a save vs. death, or perhaps they will simply be stunned and displaced to the nearest available open space on the pmp, or even end up stunned and back in the deep ethereal plane.
however, as i have mentioned, these first approximation equations are no problem for me, take practically no time at all, and lend the game a sense of realism that i enjoy, and even then i only employ them in those rare instances when a quick calculation will show if you can stop in time or you will hit that wall, and this doesn't come up very often to begin with.
periodic nexus points are like permanent ones except they don't quite bridge the gap from the pmp to a different plane.
as creatures of the pmp, you are tied to it in a very real way.
usually i won't even do that but will instead send a representative of the deity.
eventually, when close enough to the pool or demi-plane, time is running there at the same rate that it is running on that other connected plane.
eventually, if you did it right, the probability of you being elsewhere became higher than the probability of your being here.
another way the empire takes advantage of the time differential is in a type of punishment employed in their justice system.
with the proper tuning forks a group can travel from the pmp directly to any of the four elemental planes or directly to the ethereal or astral planes.
if you are even further away, the trip is still possible since you have a rough idea of where these things may be; but several extra encounter rolls would then be typical no matter how well you knew your way.
such places may be found to be unusual with the aid of a detect magic or a detect invisibility spell.
however, i allow them to refresh their memory at 10 times the normal rate; that is, they gain 10 times any experience earned until they reach the level they had formerly achieved at which time they earn experience at their normal rate.
spells and most other consideration follow the guidelines given in themanual of the planes except where they violate my basic premises.
for now, it is enough to know that reaching the first layers of the outer planes may be accomplished via the astral plane or through the so called conduits which connect them directly to the pmp.
but having differences can be nice as well.
however, as i have mentioned, these first approximation equations are no problem for me, take practically no time at all, and lend the game a sense of realism that i enjoy, and even then i only employ them in those rare instances when a quick calculation will show if you can stop in time or you will hit that wall, and this doesn't come up very often to begin with.
i usually have the party go there on some specific quest.
i imagine magic works differently on the astral plane than on the pmp and probably is similar to that which is stated in themanual of the planes.
the near, or border ethereal plane all places on the pmp touch the near, or border ethereal plane.
things that seem to make perfect sense on the astral plane when examined in the cold hard light of the pmp would seem to be utter rubbish.
of course the outer planes do exist, as well as the gods, and are an ever-present reminder of the powers that be.
thus, you travel to the border ethereal via aplane shift spell.
for example, a man with an 18 intelligence and a 12 wisdom would have an acceleration of up to 15 ft/sec^2.
these pools naturally occur and are gateways into other planes of existence.
there is but a single encounter roll when going from point a to point b while confined to the border ethereal plane, and while staying above, or at least, nearly above ground.
while in an ethereal state, one can pass freely though most things on the pmp without notice or harm.
the ethereal plane is the other plane of existence which touches the pmp and which is also extensively used for travel.
he would keep and use this bonus until he left the ethereal plane.
of course what usually happens is something native to such a plane takes the brief opportunity to come onto the pmp, giving any such convenient party something to deal with.
the time required for this travel - from point a to point b via the deep ethereal - is typically 1/10000th of the time that it would take to really travel there via the pmp on a great circle route.
you hurriedly rush into the city to warn your friends.
now traveling to katana would only take 3 or 4 hours, 1/100th the time of the sea voyage.
the time required for this travel - from point a to point b via the deep ethereal - is typically 1/10000th of the time that it would take to really travel there via the pmp on a great circle route.
it's always easy for a player to proclaim their pcs are perfectly willing to endure considerable hardships, great amounts of pain and anguish, untold suffering, or even wait seemingly endless amounts of boring time to achieve even the littlest of goals.
the entire astral plane glows of magic and appears to be well illuminated in a dull gray kind of way.
but the point is your typical demi-plane will typically have normal gravity.
even at this speed of 10x the border ethereal speed it is possible to get most places on orlantia in just under one hour, provided you have no encounters or other problems along the way.
as such, these creatures would only be seen near orlantia if they actively traveled astrally toward, or to it.
or better yet, an acceleration formula as a function of one's intelligence and wisdom.
the natural chemical bonds set up in the brain that create our long term memories are also slowed down by that 400,000 to 1 factor, just like all other metabolic functions.
typical examples of terminal velocities might be 100 feet/second in air, 10 feet/second in water, 1,000 feet/second in fire, and 0 feet/second in earth.
unfortunately the work, when examined, would have the scrambled or nonsensical arrangement of a dream.
while confined to the pmp, as one travels faster and faster, time acts differently.
first, the truestone artifact is physically kept there.
unfortunately, even though they discovered they could travel elsewhere, they didn't always know where.
all of these places happen to be running sufficiently close to the real pmp time; so they will not make much of a difference.
if he rolled an 82, his bonus would be as if he had an 18/82 strength.
the inner planes may be, of course, useful for an adventure or two every now and then.
so, be careful not to let your players ignore their physical or mental hardships at the snap of one's fingers.
these fields, or pockets of astral space, have time running closer to the pmp time.
ethereal water will not drown you.
real water, somehow brought into the ethereal plane, will eventually turn to ethereal water.
only some natives of the ethereal plane, like phase spiders, can detect this wind and take such displacements into account.
but the point is your typical demi-plane will typically have normal gravity.
that is, to get to the paraelemental planes, quasi-elemental planes, +mp, or -mp via plane shift, one must first either be ethereal or adjacent to said plane on another inner plane.
under such considerations, it is impossible to take advantage of thousands of years of adventuring, gaining treasure, magic, and experience, and finally returning to the pmp dozens if not hundreds of levels higher than you were just a few pmp days before.
you may not travel back to the astral plane without employing additional magic such as anotherplane shift spell.
real water, somehow brought into the ethereal plane, will eventually turn to ethereal water.
as such, a cleric of thor will use a hammer, but a cleric of poseidon would almost certainly use a trident, while a cleric of athena might use a spear or a sword.
the first thing that made me cringe while reading the manual of the planes was the official written word that all "time" is a constant in all known planes of existence and can not be expanded, contracted, created, or destroyed.
some weapons and armor may be ruled to have unusual qualities that allow them to forgo their normal penalties.
if he rolled an 82, his bonus would be as if he had an 18/82 strength.
this travel is usually along a great circle route unless going through the planet's crust, which is a somewhat more dangerous proposition.
long term memories are more chemical in nature, or at least have a definite chemical component.
unfortunately, the evil wizard you are after, just teleported to katana.
the first thing that made me cringe while reading the manual of the planes was the official written word that all "time" is a constant in all known planes of existence and can not be expanded, contracted, created, or destroyed.
your speed is 100 times your normal pmp movement rate.
these astral demi-planes are sometimes artificial, but usually they are naturally occurring, such as a large chunk of earth floating like an island in astral space.
here, in the border ethereal, the ether cyclone is not a normal possibility.
time is not constant everywhere, but even on the pmp alone time is positively warped.
also, periodic nexus points have very regular duration so you may rely on them.
as an example, a nexus point to the paraelemental plane of ice may be found in the permanently frozen wastelands of the polar regions.
for example, a hurricane may open a nexus into the elemental plane of air or a particularly powerful bolt of lightning may open one into the quasi-elemental plane of lightning.
it is likely you will leave the astral plane while such things are in short term memory (the spirit or soul).
some weapons and armor may be ruled to have unusual qualities that allow them to forgo their normal penalties.
you would really have to keep your mind occupied to prevent yourself from going insane while waiting centuries between encounters.
(one to go ethereal and travel to where you wish to be, one to go pmp from that point and go adventuring on the pmp or inner plane, another to go ethereal again when you are finished in that location and so you may travel back home on the ethereal plane, and one more to go back to the pmp and home).
that is, the xp. normally stated for astral goodies are awarded at that time.
this would only be done if it were so much shorter the party decides to risk it.
such a roll would, however, only be revealed to the player after combat began.
temporary nexus points may arise after, or during unusual conditions.
if you do decide to use some of the equations, when it becomes very important in a particular situation, just remember to keep your units of measurement consistent throughout the equations.
that plane, like the ethereal plane, is tied to the prime material plane in a very real, but mysterious way.
from the point of view of the astral individual, this is time that must really be waited out.
i like the general business of reducing magic pluses of weapons and armor by one for each plane removed from its intended plane.
additional damage is done by one's prime requisite, as if it were strength on the strength table.
dexterity bonuses still improve your armor class.
ethereal combat combat on the ethereal plane is tricky.
in this way, one needn't consider possible disastrous results that would inevitably arise from different races on different planes taking full advantage of unforeseen factors resulting from the time differential between planes.
now, a man would be able to achieve terminal velocity of the plane of elemental fire in about 66 seconds or one round, provided his acceleration constant is 15 ft/s^2.
the repetitive nature of the confinement is sufficient for the prisoner to remember their experience and to therefore drive the prisoner insane.
his character should stoop to such an action only as an act of desperation or great need.
periodic nexus points are like permanent ones except they don't quite bridge the gap from the pmp to a different plane.
what is happening is really a reflection of the spirit more than a reflection of the body.
naturally, the encounters in such a place would be few and far between, and mostly of creatures native to the astral plane, so even over a 1,000 years there might be only several such instances, if even that many.
from this we can see a cleric of 18 wisdom, upon traveling ethereal, would roll for exceptional wisdom if combat occurred.
(i imagine the success or failure would be a direct function of one's intelligence and/or wisdom).
you may travel in any direction desired by simply thinking it.
for example, the notion that a cleric, like some of their historical christian counter parts on earth, didn't like to draw blood and therefore were restricted to the use of specific non-edged weapons.
there is but a single encounter roll when going from point a to point b while confined to the border ethereal plane, and while staying above, or at least, nearly above ground.
let's face it, the astral plane's primary useful purpose is to travel great distances in a short amount of pmp time.
there are ways to shape the smaller pockets of demi-planes that can affect the strength of gravity, up to a point.
and, of course, that's why i like to keep the outer planes and the gods a bit of a mystery.
so far, no matter what protections were given, the travelers have never returned.
after all, it is not up to you or your pc to dictate what the properties of the universe will be.
but in their system, 1,000 years also passes on the pmp.
everything on the pmp could be given the 3 coordinates of length, width, and height.
if they are non-magical, they do zero points of damage for weapons or provide no protection for armor.
now if you look out into and through the colored pool it is possible, provided there is sufficient light on the connected plane, to see certain aspects on that plane.
you'd best get back to the border ethereal or the pmp relatively soon, least the experience fade from your short term memory.
as time runs the same here as on the pmp, you would require rest and food at that time.
thus, only a very short time (2 rounds) is required to accelerate from a stopped position to terminal velocity (1 round to change the sense of gravity, and another round to accelerate to terminal velocity).
and three, they are left with such a horrible memory of the punishment that, no matter what their new alignment, they'll do almost anything, even frequently including suicide, to avoid that kind of punishment again.
furthermore, with extended periods of time on the astral plane in my universe, there is a lack of cohesion and focus; also a lack of determination of purpose.
unfortunately the work, when examined, would have the scrambled or nonsensical arrangement of a dream.
gravity mostly depends on sheer mass and the distance between the center of mass for the bulk of it and the object in question (normally you).
convicted criminals of certain crimes, which might normally be considered capital crimes, are held in a sensory depravation area on the astral plane with the aid of a self-charging magic item.
in it we can typically find their version of a prime material plane, the astral and ethereal planes, and the inner and outer planes.
this is why i feel it is only with permission of your old dm that you may take a real character out of their universe; hopefully this dm understands his responsibility and will let you do this in practically all instances when your character is "safe" in "town" and you simply wish to play elsewhere; but even if he's a jerk and he improperly uses his power to "punish" you for leaving in this philosophical manner, you would still be playing a false character.
this gate opens up onto the far side of septer and stays open for one day.
a heal spell, also by a self charging magic item called a lavender pearl, and therefore inexpensive, cures the insanity, but not the new alignment.
these places, akin to the border ethereal, are tied to their near non-astral places in such a way that any adventuring done there could be treated, for memory, experience, healing, fatigue, poisons, and other purposes, as if it occurred on that associated non-astral plane.
you may remember learning alderami, but like someone who hasn't used a skill or language for years or decades, you've completely forgotten any useful working knowledge of those few astral years of study.
finally, it is through the astral plane, a quirk in the astral plane, or typically by some unexpected phenomenon of the astral plane, that a pc manages to accidentally or intentionally end up in an entirely different universe by permission of his or her old and new dungeon masters alike.
reach the level they had formerly achieved at which time they earn experience at their normal rate.
such places may be found to be unusual with the aid of a detect magic or a detect invisibility spell.
this item would be +2 to hit and +2 to damage on the pmp, but on the ethereal plane it is +3, +3.
so you see, the astral plane proper on my world is rarely used for anything other than travel from point a to point b on the pmp, or travel to various astral demi-planes or keeps, or to the outer planes of existence.
the government isn't trying to change their alignment to something more acceptable, but the change is just a consequence of this type of punishment.
the plane shift spell is the favorite method of travel between the planes.
other travel is by magic or conservation of momentum, both linear and angular.
finally, after a mere 2 seconds pmp time of deep ethereal travel, and perhaps a total of 10 minutes of border ethereal travel near both alodar and near katana, you arrive on the pmp close to katana.
if you so desire you can travel to such a plane in a one way manner without the aid of aplane shift spell.
for example, a pc tells me he is willing to scratch through a strong wooden door with his spoon even after i inform him it will take several days to do such a thing.
the reason for this is simply because you are living within the spirit or soul.
one example, however, might be gorgon blood mixed with mortar.
unfortunately, even though they discovered they could travel elsewhere, they didn't always know where.
all that work would be lost.
if you agree or you can live with other people's rules, that's great; if not, then you shouldn't feel obligated to do so.
upon returning to the pmp, any extraordinary or recent experience gained there is adjusted by the dm to account for the natural factors involved in such a dimension.
normal ethereal materials affect each other only slightly.
that is, to get to the paraelemental planes, quasi-elemental planes, +mp, or -mp via plane shift, one must first either be ethereal or adjacent to said plane on another inner plane.
it is possible to take one's time and be more careful.
other travel is by magic or conservation of momentum, both linear and angular.
the reason for this is simply because you are living within the spirit or soul.
in any event, missiles will eventually come to a stop and drift in the ethereal fog until found and taken.
travel within the grayish fog of the deep ethereal is quicker than the border ethereal.
more general properties of the planes in my campaigns i like to pretty much stay on the pmp.
any pluses left are still used to hit, damage, save, or protect as normal.
by visualizing the desired destination, coupled with the previous knowledge, the native's help, or the map, the party can travel to it with 1, 2, or 3 encounter rolls, depending on how well they know the path already, how well the native knows the path, or the accuracy of the map.
however, i allow them to refresh their memory at 10 times the normal rate; that is, they gain 10 times any experience earned until they
also, as the astral traveler approaches such a pool, like approaching a demi-plane, the time differential begins to drop.
thus, only a very short time (2 rounds) is required to accelerate from a stopped position to terminal velocity (1 round to change the sense of gravity, and another round to accelerate to terminal velocity).
eventually, if you did it right, the probability of you being elsewhere became higher than the probability of your being here.
you hurriedly rush into the city to warn your friends.
entering into the +mp or the -mp would be almost instant death.
from this we can see a cleric of 18 wisdom, upon traveling ethereal, would roll for exceptional wisdom if combat occurred.
thus, in order to take a one way trip into the future and avoid any pmp enemies or escape justice or whatever other things would change in 1,000 years, your group simply slips onto the astral plane, mindlessly states they will wait it out in their secure metal box far from any world or any dangers, snaps their fingers, and returns home.
the old dm usually must give their permission simply because i believe it is important not to allow a player to circumvent a world's dangers just on a whim.
finally, after a mere 2 seconds pmp time of deep ethereal travel, and perhaps a total of 10 minutes of border ethereal travel near both alodar and near katana, you arrive on the pmp close to katana.
after all, food, water, sleep, and other things, which would normally necessitate moving around, are not required in such a situation.
another example would be a nexus to the elemental plane of fire inside the heart of an active volcano.
that is, if you have a 12" rate, you could normally travel 24 miles on the pmp in 10 hours, or 240 miles in the border ethereal in 10 hours.
or, if not safe, from whence one could return if properly protected before one went there, and if you didn't remain too long.
anotherplane shift spell will take you into that inner plane.
ethereal creatures can be seen here by people on the pmp if they employ magic such as detect invisibility, or under just the right conditions.
if greater distances are required, and time is of the essence, one can travel from the border ethereal through the ethereal curtain into the deep ethereal.
it is also a fact that, due to the nature of energy, magic, one's mind, and a few other considerations, a magic user couldn't write scroll after scroll on the astral plane proper, and expect to return home with months of completed, useful work in just a few pmp minutes.
during such time you would have aged only a single day, pmp poisons would have the effect of having been in your system but a single day, you would seem to be fatigued by but a single day, and a host of other similar effects.
while confined to the pmp, as one travels faster and faster, time acts differently.
now, a man would be able to achieve terminal velocity of the plane of elemental fire in about 66 seconds or one round, provided his acceleration constant is 15 ft/s^2.
suffice it to say, all creatures which normally might be considered native to the astral plane could, in some way, travel astrally as a native ability or by magic commonly available to them.
these fields, or pockets of astral space, have time running closer to the pmp time.
i at least like to play real characters.
for example, entering earth would kill you if you couldn't freely move through or breath earth; entering water would probably drown you; entering fire would almost certainly burn you to death; entering air, on the other hand, would be reasonably safe.
of course, being close to the 113th day, or close to the old well, is probably good enough provided you go through the extra astral travel and any resulting extra encounter rolls.
i have, for example, a little known gate that opens when septer and folar eclipse when they are both in full phase.
in this way the natives can travel within the astral plane and their demi-plane.
he would keep and use this bonus until he left the ethereal plane.
ultimately, this is a safer and quicker method of travel only when a single encounter roll is to be made because you know the path well, your guide knows it well, or you have hyper-accurate maps and information.
the relativistic effects of time actually become noticeable when achieving speeds of about 1/10th the speed of light or greater.
keeping the players from knowing too much about the outer planes, the gods, or even the after life is one's best defense against their trying to take advantage of the weak links in one's armor.
i believe, at one time, e. gary gygax himself took such a stand, foolishly reserving the right of "last word" creativity in any ad&d system for himself.
as such, it is true the ethereal and astral planes frequently come into play.
that is, on the 113th day of the year, if you plane shift to the astral plane from the old well in farmer brown's north field, you will immediately come across the color pool to the elemental plane of water which leads to the "undersea" city of ariel on the elemental plane of water.
