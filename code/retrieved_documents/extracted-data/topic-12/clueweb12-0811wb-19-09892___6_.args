so it also requires having the right management and experience to balance the priorities to deliver the right product on time.a mistimed release can severely impact sales, cash flow, and the company.i am just saying that too often companies get obsessed with filling the plane with too many features and requirements without doing the hard prioritization and analysis of what is most importantly going to make customers happy and drive new sales.it just forces the team to clarify the absolute minimum requirements necessary to deliver the right product for the market.one of the wonderful things about delivering “software as a service” is that scheduling “releases” is purely a marketing event…new features can be seamlessly deployed as soon as the code to support them meets our quality and stability thresholds.sales knows when it can start telling prospects about the new product and time it appropriately so it can get customers lined up for the next quarter without delaying sales in the existing one.this eliminates the tension between date-driven and feature-driven approaches, as the better choice will generally be obvious once we have an answer to the question of why we feel the need to announce a new release.it runs on a schedule and therefore may not be filled to an efficient capacity or overly filled during rush hour.this means marketing has to have its collateral ready, upgrade program in place, and product launch schedule set.not because they’re incompetent, but because it’s harder than it looks, and you need to have a feel for what’s possible and what isn’t.the train is leaving the station nov 19, 2004 in entrepreneurship early stage companies have to be nimble and disciplined when creating and releasing product.perhaps the discipline of meeting a date is important for a young company but my experience is that you don’t want to go through the expense of a release unless you’re sure customer needs will be met.5 responses to “the train is leaving the station” matt nov 20, 2004 at 6:25 am # one of the wonderful things about delivering “software as a service” is that scheduling “releases” is purely a marketing event…new features can be seamlessly deployed as soon as the code to support them meets our quality and stability thresholds.nov 19, 2004 in entrepreneurship early stage companies have to be nimble and disciplined when creating and releasing product.the release runs like a train schedule, whoever makes it to the station on time is part of the release.
