in this way, one needn't consider possible disastrous results that would inevitably arise from different races on different planes taking full advantage of unforeseen factors resulting from the time differential between planes.relatively secure in the astral plane in such a place, since the time is so similar to the time on the pmp, a wizard could learn spells, do spell research, create magic items and scrolls, and other normal activities as their body is functioning in a normal time stream.for example, entering earth would kill you if you couldn't freely move through or breath earth; entering water would probably drown you; entering fire would almost certainly burn you to death; entering air, on the other hand, would be reasonably safe.ultimately, this is a safer and quicker method of travel only when a single encounter roll is to be made because you know the path well, your guide knows it well, or you have hyper-accurate maps and information.after all, food, water, sleep, and other things, which would normally necessitate moving around, are not required in such a situation.convicted criminals of certain crimes, which might normally be considered capital crimes, are held in a sensory depravation area on the astral plane with the aid of a self-charging magic item.for example, you have to rest, study, or pray 400,000 times longer to get your spells back, to naturally heal, to accumulate life force or experience, or in many other ways, to get anything worthwhile done on that plane.in addition to this, any training cost would be a mere 1/10th of the normal training cost and take only 1 day per level to relearn their old skills).still, this is mindless, repetitive work as opposed to creative work, and even then it takes extreme concentration not to lose your train of thought in the plane of thought.by temporarily becoming astral, moving the desired distance and direction while the mind is shut down or in a state of protected suspension, and popping back to the pmp in the desired location, these spells move small objects from point a to point b quicker than any other known method of travel.any change in the velocity of an object or person is mostly mentally achieved by an average of one's intelligence and wisdom rather than just their intelligence.these places, akin to the border ethereal, are tied to their near non-astral places in such a way that any adventuring done there could be treated, for memory, experience, healing, fatigue, poisons, and other purposes, as if it occurred on that associated non-astral plane.it too would have an effect on time, and thus what we consider normal time flow would be an aspect of the same phenomenon that causes time to run more slowly near any demi-plane).you will therefore begin to tire, hunger, heal, learn, and age as you would if you were on the other connected plane.it is practically a death sentence to enter most of these planes without the proper preparations.
