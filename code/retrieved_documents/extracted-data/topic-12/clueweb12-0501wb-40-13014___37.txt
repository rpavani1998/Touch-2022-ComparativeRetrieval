on  our trip, many of the passengers ignored the scenery and talked about other  places they'd traveled.
meetings are conducted via video or phone conferencing and screen sharing.
4 years ago it is medium to short haul trips.
to drive from vancouver to toronto in  three days would be impossible.
both liberal and conservative governments have cut subsidies for passenger trains.
following that logic, you should be able to get more than 2 beers at a football game.
the cost of upgrading the track to any meaningful speed is prohibitive.
the wide-open spaces in canada will not likely be covered in 'bullet trains'.
really need to build new tracks though.
train travel requires huge infrastructure compared to air travel and with a population as small and diffuse as that of canada, it cannot compete with air.
4 years ago we can all take off our hair shirts now.
4 years ago jwstewart: quote:quote: but, it would be too slow compared to air travel, so it would fail.
although i'm not religious- he is right.
george monbiot, in his book heat, confesses he can find no solution for air travel as a contributor to global warming.
because the trains 'tilt', they are able to take curves faster and because they have a lower centre of gravity, they are more stable.
other transportation systems can  reduce their emissions, but airliners are locked into burning kerosene at high  altitudes.
(train trips that year jumped by 17 per cent over 2003.)
i know there's the old argument about "people need face time", and this is true to an extent...but not when you balance it against global warming and the fact that we are rapidly running out of oil.
costs would  have to come down dramatically, requiring a dramatic boost in subsidies.
according to wikipedia, 80 per cent of our  current train travel is in the windsor-quebec city corridor.
less employee time per trip and each train can make more runs.
think of the population denisty versus north america.
r'man, w'man, iamc and jane doe might have a lot of thoughts, but i'm considering mostly its the tax system.
4 years ago high-speed rail seems to work well in europe, including areas where you might not think.
could we hand air travel over to the minorities: the very rich, the  very powerful, and the military?
on the shorter trips, i don't doubt the train traveller would reach his/her destination ahead of the flying passenger.
it would take equal ghg taxes to effect peoples travel choice.
finland's high-speed link between kupio and helsinki (500 km) serves a sparse population of less than a million, but nevertheless manages to run 5 times a day - 7 hours by car, mostly in the dark, or 3 1/2 hours by train.
i think we agree that at some point, air travel will simply not be reasonable.
the #2 slows down or stops several times a day to let freights go by.
we'd brought our own lunch, and used  airline-style pull-down tables.
to run a similar service for double or triple the number of passengers  would require an enormous investment in infrastructure: double- and  triple-tracking, more trains, more stops, split-second scheduling.
costs would have to come down dramatically, requiring a dramatic boost in subsidies.
ever see a gas pump that had a limit?
germany's high-speed has been limited by the low number of grade-separated tracks for the ice - many still share lines with freight and local service, forcing the ice to run at 160 kmh on many runs, so deutsche bahn committed a year or so ago to spending $7 billion euros in the next 4-5 years to double the number of high-speed grade-separated lines to 6000 km.
moreover, passengers would have to change their attitudes and expectations.
it would probably be cheaper in the long run to invest in nano-technology that allowed for a small manufacturing unit in every home -- to construct the goods we wanted... and save transportation in the real world for us meat sacks and other non-replicable items.
the banff trip, for example, stops and lodges its passengers in a hotel in kamloops so they can do they entire run in daylight.
i went too and from winnipeg (2 nights), sleeping in coach, this spring, and down to oakland in a roomette.
the wide-open spaces in canada will not likely be covered in 'bullet  trains'.
oil will be too scarce or too expensive, and you can't run a plane on electricity, as you can a train.
the idea of taking three days and nights just to attend  a wedding or graduation, or a business meeting, would seem intolerable by  comparison.
the reality that regular cargo gets priority over passengers should come as no surprise, the cargo was paid for long ago and regularly and there is no passenger rail service anywhere any time that was not subsidised by cargo shipments.

4 years ago like crawford, i too have taken some lengthy rail journeys lately, and enjoyed them a great deal.
it's not as comfortable as the  train, but it's brief.
an airliner on wheels the second stage of our trip was sharply different from the #2.
higher classes of service also cost more.
on many corridors in north america, the tracks are nearing capacity with all the freight being shipped around so there is not the track time to run much passenger rail effectively.
more likely are coal fired throwbacks that crawl along at a snails pace.
destinations are close, and you can generally go  from downtown to downtown.
equally important, this train was fast.
the only thing is the view isn't as exciting as from a plane - at 250 kmh the scenery flashes past so fast you get nauseous watching, or else you're in a trench or tunnel.
i rode the service frankfurt to berlin a couple of years back - 4 hours portal to portal, sorting my documents and pictures on the laptop with a glass of german beer at my elbow all the way.
regarding population density, i think it's safe to assume canada's will rise.
