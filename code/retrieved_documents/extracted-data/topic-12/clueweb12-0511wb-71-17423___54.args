an old line vet or farmer would watch the animal carefully and make sure that it is not rigid or distracted.
in my experience city folks will sit and wallow in the discomfort because their work is somewhere else that they do not got when they are sick or injured.
we as humans have the curse of anticipation and can feel the dentist drill long before it enters our mouths.
similarly, practice management is mostly about satisfying the customer which is not the animal.
when i was in school, i was simply told that animals have “a higher pain threshhold”.
as gina described, the calves were up and eating within minutes.
i remember products like lasso and dual used for anual grass control in corn and potatoes that was supposed to be an entirely safe herbiced.
i think what’s setting folks off here, however, is that you’re presenting your pain management thoughts (which, in and of themselves, do promote an understanding, if not agreement, with the rural mindset) through your rural/city perception as if that perception were a universal truth.
i also pointed out that urbanites have similar prejudices against rurals but you chose to ignore that.
while he acknowledges the public’s increasing tendency to anthropomorphize animals and demand a higher grade of services, he still doesn’t use analgesics following spays.
just because pigs have been neutered without anethesia and after care in the past, doesn’t make it right.
while he acknowledges the public’s increasing tendency to anthropomorphize animals and demand a higher grade of services, he still doesn’t use analgesics following spays.
(now back to healing from my broken leg that went for three weeks without a proper diagnosis while i kept going to work in my city job every day . . . . . )
i have seen farmers in their 80’s limping around completely surpressing severe arthritis symptoms and not thinking a bit of it except to cuss a bit when they can’t grip something as well as needed or perhaps can’t climb a ladder.
in fact even the most modern vet schools will teach this in discussing diagnostic skills.
the rules for the identity of organic milk totally prohibit the use of even antibiotics in treating cows for mastitis.
so i don’t think that not showing it doesn’t mean they aren’t feeling pain.
only pharmacies may dispense drugs on a prescription.
comment by dorene — october 26, 2007 @ 6:22 am well, as perhaps the only blogger here that is from a farm background i have to weigh in.
these people have no less empathy for their animals than you do but have developed different strategies to deal with it that have proven themselves successful over an extremely long period of time.
it prevents re-visits and possibility of pain developing without having the “waste” that well managed time… also, country vets are more likely to be dealing with someone who is themselves more experienced with animals and vet care than the average urban pet owner.
its both practical and effective if you know what you are doing.
it is not at all pretty and extremely painful but pain medications are not allwed either!
you are clearly an intelligent, articulate individual.
most vets have portable ones but i had built a home made one into my heifer shed that was probably not as sophisticated as the ones you saw.
that said, i will say that pain is arguably a perception with a variety of threshholds.
the excuse that ‘that’s just the way it’s done around here’ or that that’s how it’s been done in the past, or that farmers are desensitized to stock animal pain is no excuse.
but, unless you can tell me that they withheld medication even when the animals were in visible distress i think that advocating the loss of their licenses is simple reprehensible and ill informed.
i firmly believe that you can teach yourself not to feel pain as you can also teach yourself to feel every little ache.
remember - i said judicious use of meds, not pill-popping.
people here are seen by il folk as crude and rough and maybe a little dumb.
i don’t pop a tylenol for every little headache; in fact, i’m pretty pill adverse, choosing natural methods for pain relief.
i’ve also lived in the very rural and very poor fishing and timber communities of franklin county, florida.
half hour later, both were grazing in a new pasture as if nothing had ever happened.
some people thrive on suffering, bernie; i am not one of them and i certainly would not perchance this with animals.
remember, i’m talking about judicious and medically advised pain management.
their education comes from many lifetimes of observations and wise vets will accept this and learn from it themselves.
quite the contrary to your assertions i am simply asking the non-rural among you to reserve judgement on a group of people that have not always been served well by the latest technology and are (i would hope) understandably skeptical about its benefits and cost.
pain is an important feature of evolution and an entirely natural informative tool and as long as it does get out of hand and become debilitating any animal can and does use it effectively to help in the healing process.
they can tell you if they are in distress by their eyes and their actions.
this is simply an acknowledgement that a responsible professional remains up-to-date with the new findings in their field.
and i listened, too, to plans to breed a great field dog to two top males — one of them deceased.
i know of no vet or rural pet owner who would knowingly allow their animal to suffer
this in fact was pointed out by others in this thread early on not to mention the revenue generated by selling the drugs in the first place.
i’ts like the madison cab driver, who with the friendliest intentions, referred to the “fact” that i think of wisconsin as “flyover country.”
she has redesigned a lot of the squeeze chutes and other livestock restraint systems so that they are safer and even more effective at calming animals.
which, of course, it isn’t, ‘though i can empathize that it feels that way from where you sit.
farmers live in their work and do not have the opportunity to think about it.
what i have found interesting is the presumption that the idea of wholesale and automatic medication of animals would in fact be the practice advocated in a ceu course.
and yes, continuing education is essential for country vets, farmers and ranchers, because the world is changing everywhere.
heck even just a few years ago (3 and 5), i was not sent home with painkillers following spay/neuter surgeries.
i think it’s up to vets to stay very current and always inform their patients and give them choices.
now if a hurried urban vet in their tightly scheduled modern practices doesnt have time they are many more times likely to hand over the pills.
the argument that people who believe this aren’t monsters is absolutely valid, but so is the argument that they’re incorrect to believe this, based on the facts.
comment by bernard j. (bernie) starzewski — october 26, 2007 @ 7:02 pm re comment “folks who live in rural areas are more stoical about pain too… it’s partly cultural and partly practical (there aren’t nearby medical practioners)”
it arrived via mail on minnesota board of veterinary medicine (mbvm) letterhead.
i still have plenty of relatives there and have made a life long study of observing the differences first hand.
while this vet is trying to frame the issue as country/city, i thihk it’s more a function of age of vet.
but as time wore on people discovered on their own that his methods had problems and although they were used in thousands of barns later studies showed that they were in fact rather inhumane because it restricted the cows movements and often lead to severe injuries and even death, certainly losses in animal productivity.
until management of livestock for food consumption is done humanely, regulation and enforcement how animals are being managed in their households is standardized, changes in the sheltering and animal service standards are consistent, this is just another mess to take up court time.
it set the tone for the rest of the story and sadly cast a pall on the good work pain management specialists are doing.
my cats show little to no pain until they are very, very sick.
that the smart gp dvm will recognize that this is a specialty and will likely refer you to someone greatly experienced in this area.
you might be surprised at what people in the city endure.
ask a city dweller and you are more likely to hear how their back is acting up again.
no free passes for being morally superior to us weak, lazy, corrupt city people.
that’s because pain is real and physical, and it uses energy and physiological resources to “ignore” it, that could better be spent onhealing.
my sister would wilt under conditions i take in stride, for example.
do the same in a farming community and that part of the talk will take less than a minute.
it may surprise you to know that doctors who specialize in pain management are not backing away from prescribing pain meds.
some are longer lasting [a few days] - enough to get you through the grueling front end of recovery.
people with that ethic and commitment to their lives and work are harder and harder to find.
as i said, there are lots of facts in this case, we don’t know them, and the media often gives only bits and pieces of a story.
she related that to her own experiences of being calmed by the application of uniform, steady pressure, and built a “squeeze chute” for herself that she found helped her calm down when she became very agitated.
even if a vet doesn’t do this routinely they shopuld certainly be capable of doing it upon request.
i recently came across just this discussion on vin (veterinary information network), so it is very relevant.
the pain scale has been getting a lot of positive attention from the veterinary community, and i can tell you that clients that i have shared it with have appreciated it too.
but, if you go out and run a marathon you are likely to do yourself a huge amount of harm.
as it turns out, a year ago i got to tag along to an anesthesiologists’ seminar.
(this offered as, apparently, a reason we should be guided by the opinions of those smart, sensible wisconsin farm folks.)
i can’t imagine my pain sensitive dog going through ortho without pain meds.
i’m a rough and tumble city gal (at the moment) that can handle quite a bit and my life can’t stop for a freakin’ hang nail which you are getting pretty close to implying.
if my new pal scout was injured and aparently in pain i would not hesitate to buy the medicine to relieve it.
incidentally, you will be pleased to know that my local library emailed me to let me know that “merle’s door,” the book you recommended, has come in.
gravity will cause you to fall to the gorund if you jump out a window, even if you sincerely believe you’re superman, and untreated pain following major surgery or physical trauma will slow your recovery and potentially cause complications—even if you think you’re superman and can just “ignore” the pain into non-existence.
the veterinarian understandably is protesting the suspension, and “has gone to trial, hired expert witnesses and spent $85,000 defending his reputation and his standards of practice.”
weird experience for a city girl, i tell you, but a very interesting and thought-provoking one.
i am talking about being able to just not feel it.
i think you will find that part of the curriculim of the modern vet school deals with client management which is not the same thing as patient management - owner vs. animal.
have a passing knowledge of rural texas (this morning i notice bruising from where a ranch gate hit me, and a cut from a barbed-wire fence!)
they have learned over the centuries that research is only as thick as the next study.
if i ever break my back again, i sure hope that my physician doesn’t point out that we live in a remote rural area and that consequently i do not need medication.
people shouldn’t believe that if they live in podunk the practice of medicine is anything less than in the city,” he says.
my former in-laws had a small dairy farm.
okay, so i went elsewhere and got it and immediately saw relief on his face—broke my heart.
i have seen dogs with terrible injuries who are used to being with the boss who you would think would just not want to get up become disraught at the prospect of not being where they were supposed to be and will hobble out on three legs or crawl if they have to to be with the boss.
christie, love ya, but you need to join gina at the ranch.
october 25, 2007 i lived in the country for 16 years, and in all that time, i never noticed that pain hurts any less when one has cows or horses for neighbors instead of an accountant and her engineer husband.
nobody here is saying rural people are bumpkins.
some of the best observations were in fact made by people who turned on me a bit after i went off on that tilt.
while i may be a city girl, i have seen horses gelded.
my friends adore and respect their cattle, and so, too, do the people we went to pick up the new ones from.
we also have a horse vet that commutes up to treat the ranches and private horses around these parts.
comment by nancy nielsen — october 26, 2007 @ 10:00 am modern ideas of the pan-pharmacopia have simply not gained their respect and depending on the details which we do not know, you shouldnt sit in automatic harsh judgement.
some animals do not show any symptoms of pain and their activity remains normal after procedures.
- but now the smart ones who are not psychiatrists or neurologists are rethinking prescribing them.
that doesn’t mean that i don’t suck it up and go to work and do housework and take care of my dogs and live my life.
what i describe in #2 above is the primary reason - i believe - that postoperative pain medications have not traditionally been a part of customary veterinary practice.
as is, i prefer to be guided by terms that have real meanings, and specific information from the companies marketing/producing the foods—including whether or not they’ll actually answer specific questions for concerned consumers.
folks who live in rural areas are more stoical about pain too… it’s partly cultural and partly practical (there aren’t nearby medical practioners)
but i can also accept that a particularly defyant dog can be saved from loss or death if nothing else works.
it is my impression that veterinary medicine tends to follow trends in human medicine.
pain tells the dog the lay still and is doing you and your pooch or whatever a great service.
you might be better to break it down by up bringing and personality.
if you remove the negative “city-soft” connotation you’ve attached to pain management and consider it simply on its own merits, even disregarding the many studies that show healing occurs faster in the absence of pain (which i don’t), there’s no harm in granting an animal relief, be it a cow, a working dog, or a housecat.
a good orthopedic surgeon for example will have a strong standard by which to determine which drugs are appropriate and for whom.
by catching the reader’s attention with the story of one osteopath
as mentioned previously, our animal management standards are not national or cross industry.
the moral judgment of an individual who takes or fails to take pain seriously is absolutely dependent on their viewpoint, education, lifestyle, cultural issues, etc.
there is no doubt in my mind that not offering pain management is cruelty.
but having been through surgeries and broken bones and painful burns i know that i do sometimes choose pain relief.
the issue is in fact about respect for the opinions of others and at least making some attempt to understand their motives and concerns.
and if they think i’m projecting feelings onto my dog, i challenge them to manage her when she’s in pain.
i stopped the pain meds on my bladder boy early.
when il people come here on vacation they are referred to as “fibs” which does not stand for fine illinois boys.
comment by cardimom — october 26, 2007 @ 8:29 am i too grew up in an agricultural community and support bernie’s view that there is a different way of looking at things — not wrong or bad, just different.
kinda funny that i was the one who filled in for my farmer when he was struck with lyme and needed help with the sat csa.
in fact, you are the one who has been persistently describing city folks as lacking the intelligence, practicality, and moral fiber of rural folks.
basically tapered off petty quick as he dictated.
while you may find some school somewhere that would have a course offering to that end the outline i gave for pain as a diagnostic tool is much more likely to be the norm than and consumer’s notion of pain management vs. pain as management.
the significance of their injury simply does not occur to them so they simply ignore it.
the dog’s owners, the veterinarian, and the state board will have to hash that out.
animals, and people, recover faster and with fewer complications from surgery and injury if their pain is controlled.
many of us have experienced how stoic our pets can be in the face of pain.
sometimes ya just need some time to heal.
i can see where a person might refuse to pay for analgesic drugs, perceiving them to be unnecessary.
and these were not surgeries done in “podunk” locations — they were done in suburban clinics.
any animal that can express that kind of emotional pain surely deserves to be kept as physically comfortable as possible.
i love my animals and would never let them suffer for a minute.
as a result, in these communities it is simply not necessary to use drugs as a blanket prophelactic because that is what the owner is for.
while many farmers did a good job in managing their cattle with his equipment no one would go back to that again.
animals do not have cookie cutter solutions anymore than we do (sorry big pharma!)
if i decide to take up agriculture on even a small, urban scale (as my grandfather did, growing wine grapes and kitchen vegetables in the midst of a very thickly settled city for many years), i will most certainly seek the knowledge of farmers.
as so often happens when legal and regulatory proceedings get run through the media mill, i don’t think we can really know the facts of the case itself.
i’ve had 3 orthopedic surgeries in the last 5 years and in all cases the only pain killers i was given were the ones given to me as part of the anesthesia induction.
if rest is important, i already have ways to limit my pets activities to a therapeutic level.
i had my old freind brandy put to sleep because i thought she was suffering even though it broke my heart.
but boy, a little bit of medical help does make all of that easier.
i firmly believe that appropriate pain management should be a part of veterinary care.
this can extend to animals from farms who have their routines too and i think just getting outside is part of that.
the open, educated mind welcomes the opportunity to remain current on new findings and new learnings - regardless of whether or not all of these things get incorporated into one’s personal practice.
in defense of that clinic, it would be a violation of pharmacy laws — it would be illegal — for them to dispense this medication to anyone not their patient.
it teaches the heifer not to go there where she might get into trouble.
if she feels better, she’ll do too much.
i don’t remember being given pain meds when any of my animals were spayed (persians 20 years ago and pepper 5 years ago).
you can also ask for something for the pain that will not cure the ankle but will make it feel just fine.
he probably just looked back at them briefly and just looked at their gait to make certain that none of them were walking stiffly and then a little closer to see if there was any excessive bleeding.
if you want the fastest and best recovery without adverse effects, then pain management might be indicated.
when she was young, she noticed how the pressure of the squeeze chutes seemed to calm the cattle.
if you dont think that pain can be a useful tool in managing the behavior of animals consider what an electric fence does.
here is my short story, when my vet called in a pain medication prescription (she was coming up to euthanize my dog) the week of the euthanasia, the clinic refused—stating that my dog had to come in for an exam.
i can’t just blow things off to sit back and complain and take pain killers.
i’ve got one friend in the deep suburbs who whines with a headache; i’ve got a 35 year-old cousin, mother of 4 kids under 12, dying of cancer in the next 6 months.
now, you can use a cane or a crutch and you can go to a doctor and have him give you an ankle brace to keep you off of it.
for me, coming to wisconsin was like discovering some lost civilization where local vets had their instruments in the back seat of their cars and medications in jars in the kitchen cupboard and their wives maintained paper ledgers of the accounts.
i really do think people need to step out of themselves sometimes (and i’m not singling anyone out here) and look at the situation from outside their own point of view.
in quoting me you plucked out only the side of my comments that were negative toward urbanites.
comment by the other pat — october 27, 2007 @ 7:07 am i’ve read her books and heard her speak.
and you can also make a good psychological case that those who whine or those who overload on drugs probably have serious psych issues [on the farm and in the city - mental illness doesn’t discriminate].
but i can and do evaluate the actual words and facts themselves, as statements.
but the calves don’t seem to get all upset about it.
city people “wallow” in our pain.
pet owners tend to be empathetic with their animals and not clinical.
so, its understandable that with your experience you would opt for pain killers when others with a different background would not.
(the vet even offered a sympathetic “sorry, guys” before his work.)
i began school in pre vet med but ended up in ag, have worked as an artificial inseminator and have assisted vets in any number of procedures.
comment by great dane addict — october 26, 2007 @ 10:23 am because my vet was in another area and couldn’t dispense the meds the local clinic would not even honor the request from another vet.
as for assuming pain or not—i’ll yield to the guys on the question of whether castration is a sufficient physical trauma to warrant pain relief.
it reminds them to stay off the limb until it feels better which is the appropriate time to resume normal activity.
there was nothing formalized, and the vets who were fearful to depart from a yearly protocol were not being entirely unreasonable in that fear.
non-organic producers must withhold milk from sale for a fixed period depending on the drug but organic farmers must take the cow out of production entirely if treated.
now they know the route i want to go, so we generally start there and talk about future options, unless they feel traditional my be better.
they are seen as whiney self interested and materialistic.”
comment by catmom5 — october 27, 2007 @ 3:36 pm deanna, we know a lot more about fda-approved drugs as opposed to herbs, natural methods, and supplements, not to mention where these drugs and supplements are manufactured and how well [or not] quality-controlled.
i do not agree that this is all “gray area” stuff.
i know what to look for and so would any of my farmer friends.
then, non drug methods would be used such as massage or warm or cold compresses long before the pills came out.
but, do not discount the natural pain relief of simply not dwelling on it.
comment by bernard j. (bernie) starzewski — october 28, 2007 @ 9:05 am bernie, your smug superiority and condescension are not helping you convey whatever actual value there may be buried somewhere in what you’re saying.
i think that rural people are insulted by the continual insinuation that they are somehow less educated or backward or stupid compared to city people.
it isn’t common but it most certainly is entirely legal, possible and safe for public health as nsaid withdrawal periods are only a few days (4-7, typically).
they are seen as whiney self interested and materialistic.
i think that rural (meaning farm rural not just gentlemen farmers) are more active and put a higher priority on doing their daily tasks where i have seen any number of city folk sit in their easy chairs and focus on their ills instead of their lives.
yes, companies like wal-mart have in fact diluted that standard but my comments still stand.
i’m sorry if you misunderstood, but the suggestion of mandatory ceu requirements was intended for all vets, not just your favorite rural practitioner.
according to your experience automatically assuming pain is the only allowable course of treatment.
from the article: for 59 years, dr. carl seemann practiced as northern minnesota’s surgical “spine man,” a solo generalist who, at age 84, saw three clients a day until christmas last year.
i don’t think anyone knows enough about physiology to make routine pill popping truly safe.
you can get a second opinion or as you said, take your business elsewhere.
you don’t go to school in a professional field, and 20 years later continue practicing based on 20 year old knowledge that has never been updated.
comment by bernard j. (bernie) starzewski — october 27, 2007 @ 6:33 am gina, you may or may not be aware of temple grandin and her work on livestock squeeze chutes: http://welcome.colostate.edu/i.....ms_grandin temple grandin is autistic.
ignoring pain on a conscious level does not mean that the physiological effects are not there, or not taking their toll.
sorry, no. just because modern technology has given us new options doesn’t mean we can’t still get from the east coast to the west coast by well-stocked wagon train (and it’s been done, fairly recently); that the wagon train will still work, however, doesn’t mean that choosing to do that rather than taking a plane is “practical” or “pragmatic.”
from the article: for 59 years, dr. carl seemann practiced as northern minnesota’s surgical “spine man,” a solo generalist who, at age 84, saw three clients a day until christmas last year.
the pain will tell her to rest and that’s what she needs.”
i have repeatedly said that if you feel that this is appropriate for you pet then do it.
if you have an automobile and say ‘i want the basics,’ the repair shop will give you the basics.
i think these days, younger vets do not understand this and the collission of rural and urban populations are creating a mismatch of intentions and expectations.
this is not to say that they do not feel pain but i am convinced that they prioritise it differently.
she lives in the city and is ever so grateful for exacting pain management so that her kids have a better experience of what is left of their mom.
if it did, i’d never get out of bed.
when an animal is in decided pain the behavior changes and a practiced eye can spot this.
in addition, there are the economics of agricultural practices.
in the case of major surgery or major physical trauma, though, sorry, yes, pain is a physiological fact, and you can disbelieve in it all you want; it’s still there, and like gravity, it still has real physical effects.
a wise vet can also use observations of pain to diagnose other problems or an animals lack of progress in healing which are completely negated when it is medicated.
look back and read the comments by dorene above and what her vet had told her… “because she’s a border collie and i want her to rest.
james invented the head lock stantion and influenced the wisconsin dairy barn in the same way that wright affected the prarie style home.
we have two veterinary clinics and i’ve worked with all of them for years.
lynn, i am not talking about toughing it out or working thru the pain.
many of the pain control techniques are other than drugs — physical therapy, massage, hydrotherapy, acupuncture, supplements, lifestyle changes.
i would be much more convinced of the sincerity of the urban consumers concern for animal rights if that concern for the animals extended to allowing that this same vet would not hesitate to employ.
and what about the city folks that endure all kinds of hardships farm folks wouldn’t begin to understand.
i believe a vestigial component remains active in domestic animals which is why you don’t always identify or see pain.
which would matter more if, number one, hiding pain wasn’t a survival strategy for animals in the wild, where being impaired increases your chance of being dinner for another animal, and number two and most importantly, study after study in humans and animals hadn’t shown that recovery time is shortened and complications are lessened when pain is controlled.
i’ve had several young cats spayed at once with varying recovery results in the pain and picking at the stitches areas.
you say the current lack of pain management has worked for years and years.
you do not just disagree, but actively express your disrespect for anyone who “believes in” (apparently, in your imagination, similar to “believing in” astrology) the effectiveness of pain medication as demonstrated byboth personal experience and extensive, well-documented, medical research.
no rest on the ranch, that’s for sure.
if you ask a farmer how things are going he is likely to respond “gotta go!”.
on the original situation in minnesota, i gotta be honest here: i think the vet needs to retire.
farmers live in their work and do not have the opportunity to think about it.”
as for the rest, since you’re clearly joking, i’ll just shake my head (can’t quite laugh) and go read something that’s relevant, maybe even something from one of those *gasp* hard-studying vets who should be learning from you.
and yes, by the way, those ceu requirements for lawyers and doctorsdo apply to rural practitioners just as much as to urban practitioners.
i personally think we’re a pill popping society with everyone looking for solutions that come in a prescribed bottle, even for our animals.
but if you have never been told of the pain and come from an experience base that tells you to focus on something else, that is what you will do.
of course, the effect of pain and its severity have to be monitored closely and unless you have the ability to fully sedate the dog or restrain him or otherwise enforce the inactivity sometimes the message that pain sends is exceedingly useful.
age of the vet has not been a contributing factor.
however, as i learned more about the normal husbandry practices they were being taught as reasonable and acceptable, their viewpoint made more sense to me.
i think this has happened in pain management as well as other things.
comment by lis — october 30, 2007 @ 7:44 am i think that rural people are insulted by the continual insinuation that they are somehow less educated or backward or stupid compared to city people.
when i talk to chicago relatives they are much more likely to discuse their (or another family member’s) last operation.
watched as they were herded through chutes, squeezed in a contraption i’m sure someone else will have a name for to be weighed and vaccinated, loaded on to a trailer, taken to the vet and then sent through more chutes, squeezed in an even more deluxed contraption and then castrated.
they’re all into sustainable and animal-friendly ranching — this is not a feedlot or factory farm.
and as i said early on, my dog has a very low pain tolerance, where as some of my rescues haven’t.
please bernie, i totally respect you from what you’ve written here, but people can’t be categorized by city folk/farm folk.
i can tolerate pain with the best of them, if not better.
there has been a lot of work done on pain management by the glasgow university and they have produced a way of evaluating an animal’s pain based on their behavior.
this is what farmers get used to doing with their livestock, and so telling them that their dogs and cats require more than that just doesn’t “fit” into their worldview.
nonetheless, ignoring pain takes energy that might be better used elsewhere.
i think this is the normal state for most animals who aren’t apt to sit and dwell on what just happened to them.
so i was fascinated by an article in the october issue of dvm magazine about a minnesota veterinarian currently fighting the suspension of his license due to questions about his care of a dog with a fractured leg.
i remember one cow who delivered a calf who died.
in fact, when pepper was attacked by a dalmation (this was one troubled dog) 3 years ago and required surgery to close the wounds, my vet (who i know genuinely cares about her) very specifically told me that he wasn’t givening her pain meds “because she’s a border collie and i want her to rest.
finally, it is up to the pet owner to decide what is needed with guidance.
on the other hand, my animals have no choice.
frankly, pain doesn’t deter me much.
so i was fascinated by an article in the october issue of dvm magazine about a minnesota veterinarian currently fighting the suspension of his license due to questions about his care of a dog with a fractured leg.
if you have an automobile and say ‘i want the basics,’ the repair shop will give you the basics.
think of single mothers working more than one job, for example, that can’t afford to miss work.
this so much so that lynn wants to pull the man’s license if he does not conform.
(which can be deadly, btw) us ‘city folk’ have a lot more backbone than you seem to want to believe.
their society has developed thru a health skepticism of the next big thing and have survived not by embracing every notion of new science or technology that comes along but by reserving judgement and adopting only they practices that have stood the test of time.
i listened to an explanation of advanced artificial insemination techniques that will mean that one great cow will have multiple offspring implanted in other cows.
and do not falsely infer that any of us call people in the rural area backwards.
i think we could have lived anywhere, and his pain management would have been the same {rolls eyes} my vets are both traditional and holistic, so we basically get a choice of care and a run down on the different choices.
the veterinarian was fast and skilled, and the procedure was over in seconds.
modern ideas of the pan-pharmacopia have simply not gained their respect and depending on the details which we do not know, you shouldnt sit in automatic harsh judgement.
king also said, “(t)his is not about failing to give pain medication for a hangnail.
and i do mean working: i flew in on a red eye (no sleep) and then spent 12-plus hours helping with ranch chores.
failure to attempt normal activity is certainly a sign that they need some help and i suspect this vet would tell you that.
in your opinion of this guy is simply not educated enough so his is license will have to be held hostage by attending a re-education camp.
i may be like a farmer in that my work is at home ( ;) ), but many city folks go ‘somewhere else” to get the job done no matter what.
if you are interested in education why dont we all come down to my farm for a minute and take a class on accumulated farm knowledge 101.
then the owner would have checked them later for the same things.
on calf didn’t even react; the other bawled a little.
that’s the reason that the “organic” label on something is of limited to zero value.
bernie, i thank you for reviewing the postings and consider their merit.
if there were any easy way to know what the word “organic” means on any particular package, people would be in a better position to decided whether or not it’s something they want to support.
that cow stood where her calf had been laying and cried for a very long time.
he took it easy while i did the hauling etc, even though i had 2 hands healing from an injury (the kind of injury that breaks open and bleeds all over, but not too painful).
bernie, hopefully you have also observed this in city people and animals.
i could also tell some stories about standard agricultural procedures that have not changed that much like castration that is never done with any form of anasthesia that would have a peta purson chewing their own limb off.
yesterday, i went with my friend to pick up some new cattle.
neither one of us whined or discussed it and everything got done.
but i’ve also found that the city/country arguement plays better in country courts, so i’m not surprised the lawyer is playing up that angle.
even if it was a veterinary drug, some pharmacies do carry those, and if they didn’t, pretty much every drug i can think has a human counterpart that’s close enough.
i don’t think this matter was handled wisely and believe it is a symptom of change that is in the air concerning animal care and management.
comment by the other pat — october 26, 2007 @ 7:42 am well, as someone who lives with chronic pain, i whole heartedly advocate pain management.
so, i think this “difference in treatment” is more a function of the vet’s age rather than location.
the animals are healthy and friendly, and they were patted and talked to throughout the day.
as i have said from the very beginning, judicious prescription of drugs is imperative.
my dog is extremely pain sensitive, where as one of my rescues who went through bladder surgery wasn’t (damn!
they just didn’t see the point in expending that kind of money and effort on the care of their cats and dogs.)
its a sick sick dog in that life who will not respond in this way.
that never makes good teacher/student relationships.
when you sprain your ankle your ankle is sending you a message that - hey - you had better not use me for a while.
they are busy getting on with the things animals do and dont sit and focus on it.
i have been out of direct involvement in farming for some time but never far from it or animals of other kinds and i can recognize that i am not up on all the latest trends but the information she offered is well stated.
the smart internist will refer you to a specialist who can best asses the need for such drugs.
this stems from the specific type of work ethic that says that you get up and do your job and just block that bad knee from your thoughts because there isnt anyone else there to do it.
comment by emily — october 26, 2007 @ 9:55 am i, too, live with chronic pain.
with that said, i am sure there are folks at both ends of the spectrum ~ some who overmedicate and some who don’t medicate at all.
notice that it lays down some very specific guidlines based on observations of the animals before plunking down the presriptions which is perhaps a formalization of some of the very old methods i was attempting to describe in my grumpy old way.
but even those would in fact use it if nothing else was working.
it arrived via mail on minnesota board of veterinary medicine (mbvm) letterhead.
gina, the castrations that you witnessed were actually pretty humane.
certainly, if you sit inside staring at the tv to see what briteny is up to today you become more aware of your condition than you would be if you were preoccupied with milking sixty cows in a stantion barn.
nowadays you can pretty easily find a vet who’ll agree to forego yearly vaccs, but not that many years ago, a lot of vets were afraid for their licensure if they did not vaccinate yearly.
i don’t quite see the provision of surgical pain control falling into the category of anthromorphism, nor did his attorney’s explanation do much for me: “an allegation has been made that the failure to provide prophylactic pain management just because an animal has undergone a procedure is somehow below the standard of care,” he says.
the dog’s owners, the veterinarian, and the state board will have to hash that out.
similarly, shock collars for dogs are used for all kinds of training from teaching a hunting dog not to run too far afield to preventing a dog from barking excessively in town.
all that having been said, i’m not sure dr. seemann is being well-served.
because my vet was in another area and couldn’t dispense the meds the local clinic would not even honor the request from another vet.
but in my experience it is a much deeper cultural view.
then it was found that it was not only carcinogenic but liked to leach down into the water table instead of breaking down the way dupont claimed.
i noticed that the link i posted above for the new york times magazine article does not work.
[few other types of physicians do prescribe such drugs……probably because they know that by and large they make you feel pretty darned crummy.]
dvm quotes dr. robin downing, president of the international veterinary academy of pain management and one of the authors of the american association of feline practitioners (aafp) and the american animal hospital association (aaha) pain-management guidelines, as saying: “i will tell you that we in veterinary medicine now have enough data published that it is inexcusable for any veterinarian not to have a clear understanding that it’s necessary to help a patient be comfortable following surgery… if there are five practices in a community and three embrace the guidelines, they have effectively raised the standard of care in that community.
what i hear from my clients is that they get additional fee after fee for tests and other preventative care practices.
left untreated this condition can cause the complete necrosis of the affected quater (cows udders are divided into quaters).
i have always, always found that everyone has something to offer, and something to say, if you just shut up and listen for a while.
the veterinarian understandably is protesting the suspension, and “has gone to trial, hired expert witnesses and spent $85,000 defending his reputation and his standards of practice.”
appropriate use of pain relief eases the physiological strain and makes of a speedier recovery with fewer complications; this is amply documented in repeated scientific studies.

i’d say most of nyc and surrounding is hard working folks that must work through things.
some large animals vets do routinely use local anelgesic and anesthetics for all invassive proceduries.
what you may not have noticed was that first the vet observed the animals post procedure for a bit.
but i have repeatedly said (and you have ignored it) that what these vets do is rely on actual observations of the animal that effectively lets the animal themselves request the meds.
i just don’t want any of them treating my dogs, or me.
notice that i was pointing out that each sees the other in a different light and not exclusively attacking city folk.
comment by deanna — october 27, 2007 @ 3:17 pm to me, when pain impedes quality of life, pain medication is indicated.
but knowing the reality of what is being taken for granted in those whose livelihood is based on these kinds of animal husbandry practices helps one at least understand where these ideas come from - a first and very necessary step if there is ever goind to be any reasoned discussion on such questions.
i think the responses on that thread pretty much established that vets are not doing a good job of informing their clients about the pros and cons of administered nsaids.
it was quality stuff.
i’d be interested in reading reactions from bloggers here as well.
if i am a pig farmer and i have to neuter 200 baby pigs, it would be pretty costly to go through pain management (and this includes anesthesia during the procedure) for all of them.
it’s the doctors who do not specialize in this field that are backing away…..perhaps because they recognize they don’t know enough about how to prescribe these drugs, that their practice guidelines are out of date.
seriously, if you have a headache you take a tylenol.
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06.....ain-t.html comment by marilyn — october 31, 2007 @ 12:11 pm bernie: ceu courses are not to promote a protocol, but rather to enlighten those in the field, to create a knowledgebase so that a good decision may be rendered by the practitioner.
never did i say that i wanted to pull the veternarian’s license if he didn’t conform.
how animals are managed and cared for here is vastly different between households but also definately not the urban model.
animals are hardwired differently and most wild animals do not show signs of weakness or illness until severely along.
i reside in a rural area outide of a major urban sprawl.
comment by straybaby — october 27, 2007 @ 9:07 pm bernie: i’m sorry that you have a false perception of how “city folks” deal with pain.
her work - as well as her personal history - is truly fascinating.
by christie keith october 25, 2007 i lived in the country for 16 years, and in all that time, i never noticed that pain hurts any less when one has cows or horses for neighbors instead of an accountant and her engineer husband.
this weekend i listened to a phd economist and a board-certified veterinary internist, both women, both ranchers, as well as a country vet and some really good smart stock hands.
they were complaining that clinics are guilting pet owners into tests and meds that are not really needed and are taking their business to vet clinics that are not run that way.
in your opinion of this guy is simply not educated enough so his is license will have to be held hostage by attending a re-education camp.”
i think, just like with humans, it’s highly individual.
and as far as keeping a pet quiet after injury or surgery, and pain management making it harder, that’s where crates come in handy.
i have seen animals tear their stitches out many times and think nothing of it.
comment by bernard j. (bernie) starzewski — october 27, 2007 @ 8:05 pm “in my experience city folks will sit and wallow in the discomfort because their work is somewhere else that they do not got when they are sick or injured.
people shouldn’t believe that if they live in podunk the practice of medicine is anything less than in the city,” he says.
as so often happens when legal and regulatory proceedings get run through the media mill, i don’t think we can really know the facts of the case itself.
hang around any group of older people and the bulk of the conversation will be their latest afliction.
now it’s true that animals don’t know when to take it easy when they are taking pain meds, but it’s up to the human supervise.
i don’t quite see the provision of surgical pain control falling into the category of anthromorphism, nor did his attorney’s explanation do much for me: “an allegation has been made that the failure to provide prophylactic pain management just because an animal has undergone a procedure is somehow below the standard of care,” he says.
king also said, “(t)his is not about failing to give pain medication for a hangnail.
pain meds are not only not routinely used in a lot of procedures, but they are in fact generally prohibited (i don’t remember exactly how the guidelines go) due to the fact that an animal who is destined to become part of the human food chain cannot carry pharmaceutical drugs in its system.
a voice of reason is always welcome in a hot arguement.
you are dismissing pre-emptive pain management out-of-hand because you believe the concept is a soft city-folk idea and not worthy of rural consideration.
in my own experience, (suburban philadelphia where the local vets pride themselves on having the penn vet school close at hand), my 35+ years of practice vets are fairly slow to hand out pain meds.
even though it is frequently done that one clinic “fills a prescription” for a vet out of the area or even a local vet who doesn’t carry the drug in question, it’s absolutely against the law.
many of the portable ones can also be tilted to make a kind of operating table if need be.
the hallmark of rural society is health skepticism being unwilling to quickly abandon tried and true methods for the latest bit of research.
in fact substances like “bute” have been illegally in horse racing for years to convince them to do exactly that.
i trust you’ll forgive me, though, if instead of a farmer in wisconsin, i choose to consult a new england farmer, who actually knows the local climate and soil conditions, and is well-versed in new england’s two-crops-a-year agricultural system.
in reality, though, you are the one who has repeatedly and persistently described the people you disagree with in insulting and demeaning terms.
in this area, the big chain (vca) has lost a large number of clients because they have become too corporate and to uninterested.
this is not “tried and true” old methodology, but cutting-edge, high-tech modern agriculture.
not pleasant - it was a fast process, but frightening for them being held and controlled.
the modernists always think they have the next best thing.
the pain control point is well taken, but i think the pharmacy issue is also very important here.
but its like telling someong to not think of an elephant for a half hour unless you are trained for it from little on.
i spent days sitting next to her, just gently stroking her as she laid there in pain — i felt so bad for her as she seemed miserable, but — prior to finding this site — i thought we were doing the right thing.
it is easier to personally attack me even though all i have done is give some background and plead for a little understanding in considering the possiblity of an alternate method.
i also think that all farm animals deserve to be treated humanely (i’m a vegetarian) and when necessary euthanized humanely.
many the times i went out on cold winter mornings with colds and flu and various injuries and found a way to get it done.
her behavior is how i would find her injuries.
if you choose to go the stoic route because that’s “what we did in my family” or “it’s sissy to take pain meds” then you’re not in tune with today’s modern practices.
if she retires, i will have to stop having pets.
on the “city v.s. country” thing - i do believe there is a difference here, and that - in addition to the factors bernie describes - that it is also influenced by the daily practices of animal husbandry used on agricultural animals.
when i talk to wisconsinites its more likely to be the weather or some aspect of work or life unless someone they know actually died recently.
the reality is that pain killers are essential for a good quality of life for many people who deal with chronic pain.
just because modern technology has given us new options does not invalidate millenia of evolved animal (and human) husbandry.
i have a highly regarded team of orthopedic surgeons and they are very well trained in pain assessment and staging.
no numbing before, just a wash of the area before and after with betadine solution.
yes, they vertianly do—under labelled use or amduca and with an appropriate withdrawal period.
taking pain seriously as a medical issue is not about work ethic or values.
they may just not need as much, but i would like to know they could have what they needed!
a non ag example is hormone replacement therapy for women.
you can speculate all you want that animals don’t “feel” pain because you can’t observe it, but research doesn’t support that view, even if it’s rational.
however, as an adult my belief [which is supported by scientific findings] is that reasonable pain management from the outset goes a long way towards a faster and uneventful recovery process.
i must say that i am disappointed that you feel i “would opt for pain killers when others with a different background would not.”
you’re demanding that we acknowledge the moral superiority of your farmers because they are hardworking, intelligent, practical, pragmatic people, and admit, or at least accept as fact, that we are lazy, whiny, stupid, self-indulgent slackers who couldn’t find our way out of an open paper bag.
i don’t think that anyone has figured out how to have a conversation with a dog or cow or cat explaining that although they might well feel much better after they get this pill they still should stay off that leg and not go chasing rabbits.
(dna will be used to sort out the parentage on the resulting double-sired litter.)
they don’t like it and the fees are prompting people to not get vet care or to drive an hour and a half or more to get veterinary care.
