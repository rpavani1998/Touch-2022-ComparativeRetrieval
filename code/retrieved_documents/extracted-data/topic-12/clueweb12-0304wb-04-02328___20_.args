these couchette compartments are fairly basic, and for most english-speaking travellers, a proper bed in the sleeper is much more comfortable and secure, costs very little extra, and is the recommended option.designed for 2 to 5 adults travelling together at all times, the passes do afford unlimited travel on the rail networks, and give you 1st class seating for travel on any 5 or 10 days in a 2-month period.it's very rare (and almost always a personal thing) for someone to be robbed by force or assaulted on a train.the easiest, most comfortable and usually cheapest, fastest and most rewarding way of intercity travel is by train.although without a dining car, the blue arrow is top of the line travel, fast, modern and quite comfortable in all classes, with good bathrooms and even toilet paper 90% of the time.trains are almost always very safe, with a limited risk of pickpockets, more so on the accelerat and personal services.some of these trains are very useful for exploring rural backwaters or getting off the beaten track (the train from oravita to anina in the semenic mountains offers provides one of the most scenic trips in the country).these trains are of a western european standard and are incredibly clean and modern, with automatic doors, futuristic ecological toilets, air conditioning, ergonomic seats, free newspapers and all the other bells and whistles.sleeper services (on the rapid type trains) are a great and relaxing way to travel through the rolling hills of the wine country in moldova, the stunning peaks and river valleys of transilvania, and the vast fields of sunflowers and sunshine through the wallachian plains of muntenia and moldova.so, using the rail network, you really can get to just about anywhere for a very reasonable price.these go to the smallest of villages and towns and make a tremendous amount of stops.the balkanpass gives you unlimited travel on cfr and through neighbouring bulgaria, serbia, greece, and all the way to turkey too.with many destinations just 3 to 6 hours away from bucharest, a day train is a great way to do some sight-seeing!all compartments are refurbished to a reasonable standard, and you'll have enough room to store your food and drink (which you bring with you).also, they are reasonably cheap and are increasingly used by romanians (and tourists) on business trips.
