while boat travel may be slower and a little more expensive than tube travel, it offers an extremely pleasant way to cross the city with unrivalled views of the london skyline - big ben, st paul's cathedral, the tower of london, etc.
most importantly, britain's longest motorway - the m6, branches from the m1 at rugby, leading to birmingham, liverpool, manchester, the lake district and onwards to the scottish border, and ultimately glasgow.
it is very important to check the tfl website fortravel updates, especially at weekends, to avoid disappointment.
