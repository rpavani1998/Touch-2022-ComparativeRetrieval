by 2020, passengers will be able to travel faster from point to point by high-speed rail than by plane on nearly half of europe’s densest air routes.by 2020, passengers will be able to arrive at their destinations faster by high-speed rail than by plane on nearly half of the densest european air routes.the potential for rail operators to attract airline passengers and vice versa pales when compared with the opportunity for both rail and air providers to lure passengers currently traveling by automobile.considering the size of the travel market, this presents a huge opportunity for the provider of the alternate mode of travel and an enormous threat to the incumbent.as a result, travelers will enjoy an unprecedented range of options among operators and modes of travel.both airlines and railways could win far more passengers by focusing on automobile travelers—30 percent of whom would prefer to travel by air or rail—than by trying to steal market share from each other.airlines are rising to the challenge: leading companies, such as lufthansa and air france-klm, have established rail partnerships and codeshares to broaden their reach and provide better connections into their hubs.the results of this survey provide further evidence that there is considerable opportunity in the european travel industry.our study suggests that both airlines and railways could win far more passengers by focusing on that untapped opportunity than by trying to steal market share from each other.railways and airlines are coming face-to-face with new challenges as deregulation and consolidation, combined with high-speed technologies and new business models, enable both rail and air travel to be fast and low-cost.there is room for only a few cross-border operators—success requires a differentiated offering for new consumer segments along with smooth implementation.if only a small fraction of automobile travelers who would like to switch to either train or plane could find the right offering, airlines and railways could expand their markets considerably.in germany and the united kingdom, for example, more than twice as many long-distance trips are taken by car as by air and rail combined.one of our study’s major findings is that more than 30 percent of consumers would like to switch travel modes, and in some countries the number is as high as 65 percent.furthermore, both rail and air providers have neglected the largest portion of the market: the automobile sector.
