bluetooth 3.0 is optional, as is a built-in 56k-modem (v.92), which might come in handy if you're traveling through rural or otherwise remote areas on a business trip, for instance.a great feature is the keyboard backlight, which costs an additional 40 euro but makes for easy-to-recognize keys no matter the lighting situation around you (convenient on the train, bus, plane, etc.).with higher demands regarding 3d graphics or special software, you can definitely benefit from the power of a dedicated graphics card like the optionalnvidia nvs 4200m graphics card (optimus ).it's also possible to install anti-theft software to track the laptop if stolen or remotely delete sensitive data.the sound quality of the one speaker was decent and could have made for good sound quality with the potential second speaker working when you consider the expectations of a business laptop like the dell latitude e6420.to top two factors are mainly responsible for the laptop's battery life: one is the capacity of the battery and the other is the power consumption of the system under various levels of stress.the matte screen surface prevents reflections from overshadowing the picture and combined with the high brightness, it makes foralways discernible screen contents, even in direct sunlight.on the downside, the poor picture contrast and few vertical viewing angles can be frustrating.for a huge boost in application performance, choosing a solid state drives (ssd) could be a great decision, which should easily break the 10,000 point barrier in pcmark vantage.the bright, matte screen makes using the laptop outdoors possible, even in direct sunlight.cpus as powerful as intel sandy bridge quad-core processors and the optional dedicated nvidia nvs 4200m graphics card allow for a broad spectrum of use.the case design is harmonious(magnesium-aluminum) and has a first-rate feel to it.this model can be upgraded to respond to multi-touch gestures for an extra 70 euro.with the resolution and graphics settings set low enough, the game runs smoothly.nevertheless, because of the overall very bright screen, differences in illumination cannot be detected with the naked eye.besides the 9-cell battery (about half a kilogram) contributing to the long battery life, we also have the system's low energy consumption to thank.
