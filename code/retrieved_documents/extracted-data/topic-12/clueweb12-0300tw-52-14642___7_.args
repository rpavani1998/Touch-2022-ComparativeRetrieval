if nothing else environmentalism will make our natural resources last longer, our air more pleasant to breathe and our scenery nicer to look at.the economic risks of not acting are far higher for the world as a whole than the economic risks of taking action the might not have been necessary.on the one hand you get on a plane knowing there's an infinitesimal chance it will go down; you know the statistics and you're prepared to take that gamble with your own life.it's possible that the outcome of this will one day prove to be catastrophic, it's also possible that it won't.on average 25,000 old people die eacg year because they cannot afford to eat and keep warm.david mitchell says catastrophic agw is a higher priority than directly reducing poverty through efficiency.you could fairly argue we are poisining the planet and causing alot of damage.it will bankrupt fossil fuel companies and various dicatatorships in the middle east, but not the majority of the globe.we'll have to tackle the first two whether or not climate change is happening but as luck would have it solving the first two might also contribute significantly to mitigating climate change too.there's like a one in a squillion chance that an asteroid will smash into the planet destroying all life.if you had, you would know that it concludes with this: even with the large enhancements in rate due to ammonia and ions, atmospheric concentrations of ammonia and sulphuric acid are insufficient to account for observed boundary-layer nucleation.i appreciate that climate change is happening, and i also understand we are most likely causing it, will the planet really be un-inhabitable though, or is there a chance we can adapt? 15 september 2011 2:22pm also i am a bit of a fatalist in that i believe that man has managed to cause his own demise, i don't think it is in our dna to act on a problem which may kill us in a few generations, as someone said above, there will be no clear and present danger until its too late.on the other hand the scientific consensus is that man is changing the climate in a way which will prove catastrophic for several billion people if it isn't checked.however i have no doubt that those experts who do believe it is happening are sincere (talk of tax raising conspiracies are pure tin foil hat drivel) and that even if the science is proven to be inaccurate there are numerous other benefits to be had from cleaning up our act.i do everything i can to limit the amount of pollution i personally contribute to this messy world, but i will not be made to feel guilty for emitting carbon dioxide from my mouth and nostrils nor methane my arse!
