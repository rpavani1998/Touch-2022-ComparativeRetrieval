san francisco's bart accounts for less than half as much  carbon dioxide per passenger mile as an suv.
it seems fairly obvious that if a train has few riders, it may well be burning more fuel per "passenger mile" and spewing out more pollution per mile than a packed airplane.
after all, new york city's carbon footprint is  only a third of the national average, thanks to its compactness, transit  system, and apartments that average half the size of new houses in the suburbs.
your electronics—computers, tvs, phone chargers—use energy even when they're turned off.
chester even researches the  impact of maintaining insurance on the various modes of motion!
yes, they "can," but remember that the operative word is  "can," not "are," because not all trains are created equal.
finally, there's your basic geography.
but a bad rap on trains may be spreading because of some rather superficial interpretations of recent transit research.
if boston were less dependent on fossil  fuels, the numbers would look very different.
what these guys do is go way beyond comparing energy use and greenhouse gases from vehicles themselves, and look at the energy and pollutants (like sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and carbon monoxide) generated by processes from the entire life cycle of planes, trains, and cars and the infrastructures that support them.
no wonder this document and an article by chester and his dissertation director arpad horvath have attracted attention to the train/plane question.
in fact, as these researchers point out, all comparisons can change drastically if energy sources, technologies, and demographics change.
if more people only had the good sense and social grace to carpool, motor vehicles would be far less ruinous.
hey mr. green, what of the recent claim that trains can be as hard on the environment as airplanes?– mark in richmond, california
but boston's green line light rail is responsible for slightly more carbon dioxide than midsize and large aircraft, but way less nitrous oxide.
such variables were recently analyzed in an astonishing doctoral dissertation by mikhail v. chester at the university of california, berkeley.
conversely, it may  emit less per passenger if it's jam-packed.
so it all depends on the kind of train, what type of infrastructure is built to support it, where it's located, what kind of energy it runs on, and how many passengers ride.

because of this, it seems to me that people who dwell on the train/plane issue have got the whole thing upside down.
but the fact that a commuter train, whether boston's or san francisco's is so much better than a car, makes it the best option for such areas.

stand-by power can account for as much as 20% of home energy use.
but comparing methods of travel gets a lot more complicated when you go beyond engine energy and look at the total environmental impact of everything from obtaining all the raw materials needed to manufacture everything involved, and to build and maintain roads, rails, and airports.
what's most useful about this kind of research is that it helps us view a system holistically.

yes, that a train might not be the ideal solution, and,  yes, it could be a boondoggle in the name of environment if it doesn’t  have enough riders or requires intense construction efforts or is too dependent  on fossil-fuel energy.

a comparison of san francisco's commuter train with a large jet doesn't mean all that much, because nobody is flying on the morning commute, though steve jobs once reportedly used a helicopter.
conversely, it may emit less per passenger if it's jam-packed.
what we get from this comprehensive life cycle analysis is what's indicated above.

in almost every category, planes and trains are far better for the environment than individual passenger vehicles.

for example, the san francisco bay area's electric train-transit system  known as bart is responsible for substantially less carbon dioxide and nitrous  oxide emissions per passenger mile than any plane.

save both energy and money by unplugging your devices, or put them on a power strip that you can turn off when they are not in use.
