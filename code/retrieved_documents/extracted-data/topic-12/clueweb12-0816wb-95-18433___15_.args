a modern train with right a way could do canada to mexico in 10 hours or less and would be full the whole way because unlike an airplane they pick up people on the way.tgvs have about as much room per passenger in economy as airplanes have in business class.so in this country where we're afraid to pay one cent in taxes unless it's put to good use bombing a small country to protect our civil liberties we should think about just using rail for these high profit lines.if the superliner could get up to speed or stay at top speed longer it could equal driving and still be more comfortable.however, they're rarely on time, they're not fast and they're not always cheaper than flying.the tgv experience is about getting to your destination as quick as possible with relative comfort.because of the amount of time it takes to get to airports, get checked in and get your bags and get away makes any journey under 6 hrs subject for replacement by high speed rail.the idea of taking a taxi to some airport where i have to take my shoes off, scan my bags and then wait at a gate to be crammed into a tin can with a bunch of other half sick travelers coughing on me and babies screaming is very very unappealing.not only do you have way way more room than on an airplane the train gets going quickly because they can load all cars at the same time.more trains, a bit more speed and keep them full so the ticket prices could be lower and i think we'd have a winner.the ter (inter region) do not make money and need to be subsidized.on the amtrak you feel like you can take as much time as you want to get where you need to be and for good reason, you have to.king street station across the street is just starting the process of restoration and the venetian piazza st. marks style clock tower definitely looks better as does the new roof tiles.inside the station they have a media board showing the future plans which include tossing out the water stained roof tiles, restoration of some of the marble pillars, a new walkway up to street level and a restoration of the outside of the building which will open up space for businesses etc..if you want more of a personal experience (and more costly) you can snag one of the attendants as they walk through the car and get a reservation to eat in the restaurant.
