i had to rely on memory of a us keyboard layout to figure out which one to hit which is more difficult than you’d think on a keyboard with very small keys.
i don't care how nice the display looks if i'm looking at a machine with worse specs than a $700 cheaper mac book.
trust me on this the sales guy isn't sitting in starbucks in order to download his/her email or work on the latest spreadsheet.

the odd thing to me is the number of people who claim to really notice the difference, even though the benchmarks don't seem to be that drastically different in a lot of areas.
apple didn’t invent the ultra portable, but with the macbook air it’s attempting to do it right.
that in order to achieve a baseline of functionality you are conceivably carrying around an ethernet dongle, possibly the super drive (probably not in college, but most definitely if you are traveling) a usb extension cord, plus some sort of 3g device if you really want to be mobile.

the screen size of a notebook actually determines the keyboard layout and size.
but really i think the mba was put in the most positive light as possible.
having 1 usb port would be fine.

therefore, from a real world useability standpoint, the ssd would be much better experience, because it improves in the areas where you have high expectations, and only falters in areas that you already have low expectations.

some weren’t even able to complete the process without using the ethernet dongle.
in addition, you can’t use the one usb port with the migration assistant.
admittedly i’ve never had an ultra portable break on me, but i’ve also never really dropped one.
i thought the comparison to the ferrari was excellent.
the air on paper on paper, the macbook air's size is impressive until you compare it to the macbook - in many ways the air is just a thinner macbook.
in order to keep things light, ultra portables generally have tiny batteries and are built out of very lightweight materials - resulting in poor battery life and a hardly durable feel.
lame! annonymouscoward reply good review overall by kac77 on tuesday, february 19, 2008 i feel the review was good overall.
you get to do small work on a weekend when you happen to want a latte.
i've heard great things about runcore ssd which has some really good pricing here - but if i end up dropping that kind of coin for moderately better performance, i don't think i'd be too happy.
, i just needed it to do some basic writing and web browsing.
for this person this device makes perfect sense but for anyone else i just don’t see it.
but really i think the mba was put in the most positive light as possible.
i’ve heard reviews from other sites that this process can take way more than 2.5 hours more like 5 or more.
the overall thing with this device is that in order to achieve a baseline of functionality you are conceivably carrying around an ethernet dongle, possibly the super drive (probably not in college, but most definitely if you are traveling) a usb extension cord, plus some sort of 3g device if you really want to be mobile.
the argument to looking forward where all information is on a network somewhere or at home would have held some weight.
the weight side of an ultra portable is only one facet of importance, form factor is the other.
my hands always had to do this strange ballet/gymnastics move in order to punctuate anything, which eventually drove me away from the notebook.
obviously this would have less of an impact than the iphone situation, because the battery can clearly be removed and therefore replaced, but i'm still wondering about it's limits (especially after the mention of the 8 hour bug).
since the ssd takes longer to complete write projects, and therefore more energy overall to complete the process, i would be interested to see what the usage time would be if you were to script out a process that included a lot of pdf/image/file conversions/saves.
lugging even a 5-pound notebook around to class was a pain, i wanted something whose weight and form factor resembled its name; i wanted a notebook, something very thin, very light and just as easy as a pad of paper to carry around with me.
yes, it is not the most comfortable on the eyes or the hands...
in addition, you can’t use the one usb port with the migration assistant.
finally what wasn’t touched on at all, transferring files from the host pc.
the asus eee can operate as an extension of your desktop by allowing you to write, surf and accomplish minor tasks away from your primary machine.

if you can't afford two laptops you should get a more practical laptop and skip the mba.
since writing and basic internet access were the main duties of this machine, things like hard disk space, having an internal optical drive and absolute performance weren’t really concerns; running notepad or textedit just doesn’t require much.
the mba really does require a companion pc in order to assure the buyer that he/her can reinstall the os if problems arise.
this device really has one market …the ceo.
annonymouscoward reply good review overall by kac77 on tuesday, february 19, 2008 i feel the review was good overall.
the screen is identical and the footprint is virtually unchanged.
the problem is that in the quest for small size and ultimate lightness, a number of sacrifices are made.
they are designing presentations.
with 3g this product really would have made some sense.

i owned a sony x505 imported from japan and it got me through my last year of college, but the keyboard was terrible to type on.
when you just scratch the surface it appears fine but when you go deeper the lack of ports, no drive, no 3g, no ethernet, (and no, being in it i am not going to have the marketing department change their own battery or hard drive)
you give up performance because the cooling and power requirements of a high speed cpu just aren’t possible to satisfy given the form factor and weight requirements of an ultra portable.
yes, it is not the most comfortable on the eyes or the hands...
i transferred files to and from via usb drives, logging onto the network, installing software which was apart of the class.
you said that you noticed everything starting/working quicker w/the ssd, but the benchmarks showed that in write situations, it showed an obvious disadvantage.
i was dissappointed in the lack of a mention of windows on the mba.
the start of the review comes off as a bit too pro-apple.

if you look at the weight of a textbook and remember how much you hated lugging that around in school, you’ll understand how even a 1 pound difference in notebook weight can make a big difference.
the argument to looking forward where all information is on a network somewhere or at home would have held some weight.
writing normal sentences wasn’t a problem, it’s the punctuation that really threw me off.
the start of the review comes off as a bit too pro-apple.
this thing has to feel small in your hands when carrying it around, it has to feel just as natural and painless as carrying a paper notebook around.
with that pesky dtr out of the way, let’s get to know the air a bit better.

traveling managers (marketing or sales i presume) these people use their laptops even more than college people do.

all three of these tests are heavily read reliant with almost no writing.
by steveyballmer on tuesday, july 08, 2008 it is amazing to me that so many people can't seem to see through the steve jobs reality distortion field!
in order to keep power consumption down, smaller screens with cramped resolutions are the norm in the ultra portable space.
the asus eee can operate as an extension of your desktop by allowing you to write, surf and accomplish minor tasks away from your primary machine.
it had a japanese key layout so some of the key labels were in the “wrong” places.
the trackpad so bright, so screen a sound sleeper & connectivity designed for a utopian society
expansion is an obvious problem; most of the ultra portables i’ve owned over the years didn’t have integrated optical drives, which made installing applications or just reading a disc handed to me while on the road frustratingly impossible.
back in college i needed a notebook to take to class with me that i could take notes on and email/browse with during class (not all lectures were as captivating as i’d like).
lets look at the supposed markets: college students ok the mba could possibly work it here.
will be doing power and perf comparison between the old and new configs over the coming weeks.
they are downloading email often from remote locations so having 3g capability would be mandatory.

once again, apple is selling form over function...
they are designing presentations.
when i was in college mine got a thorough work out.
and finally we have the issue of price; the culmination of all of these sacrifices is a very light weight, very portable device...that also costs a great deal of money.
i can also see it working for my wife (the primary user of our 700m).
it was quite thorough and by the end, i didn't feel the same pro-apple bias.
historically the ultra portable has been first and foremost, a very light notebook.
a full size keyboard would be wonderful.

trust me on this the sales guy isn't sitting in starbucks in order to download his/her email or work on the latest spreadsheet.
i can see the mba working for people who have the money to spend on a third computer (second laptop) and for anyone who does a lot of typing but needs a laptop that can be carried around.
without it the product comes off as trying to sell a drowning man a glass of water.
the durability issue is compounded by the notebooks being very thin, which only makes them feel more likely to break.
at the same time, having a good keyboard, a killer form factor and keeping weight down were all more important than with a regular notebook.

with a smaller screen, the keyboard that the screen covers when closed is similarly tiny.
phrozt reply mba ultraportable by totenkopf on friday, february 15, 2008 "thinner and lighter" only covers about two thirds of ultraportable, it's still basically the same footprint...

ultra low voltage cpus are generally preferred here and it’s only recently that we’ve seen ultra portables really get faster than 1ghz.

that one usb would be a hindrance no matter how you look at it.

the two pounds apple has managed to shave off and the reduction in thickness are huge, regardless of how small they may seem in numerical form.
