moving more people and goods by rail will greatly reduce co2 emissions and engender more centralized development patterns.recently, i've started seriously looking into traveling by train--it seems cheaper, it's better for the environment, and the extra time that it takes to travel that way seems worth it, just to reduce my traveling frustrations.another cause is equipment failures, which are becoming more frequent as amtrak's equipment ages without sufficient funding for replacement.there have been isolated reports of car windows being broken near train stations, but as long as you take the usual precautions of not leaving anything valuable in a visible spot in the car, it'll be fine.trains offer a very smooth ride, except in a few spots where track conditions cause bumps and jolts.train travel is a great way to travel with children (who get so restless in cars).you can walk around freely on a train, socialize with others, and eat in the caf√© or dining car, all of which are difficult to do on cars and airplanes.coach seats recline farther and offer more legroom than any airline seat, and overnight trains offer sleeping cars (though often at a hefty premium).anyway, here are answers to your questions: 1) trains are often delayed, thanks to chronic underinvestment in passenger rail in the us.highways are mind-numbingly boring, but trains pass through beautiful rural areas, small towns, and interesting urban areas.air travel is ok, but, again, you've got rising fuel costs causing inflated ticket prices, and a backed-up system that seems to always include flight delays, long wait times on the runway, and, of course, an eternity just to get through security.but don't let this discourage you: on-time performance has improved significantly over the past year and most delays are less than 2 hours.amtrak offers some great routes to major cities in the us, and their prices are quite good.this trip does take longer than by car (1 full day of travel each way) and is more expensive, but the children loved being free to roam, play cards, read books, watch movies, and i read books and enjoyed the rural scenery.east of chicago, trains were always more crowded; but still a relatively friendly mode of travel.
