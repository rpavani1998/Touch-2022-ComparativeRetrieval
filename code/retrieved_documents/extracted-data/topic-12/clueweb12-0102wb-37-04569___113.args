sharing opportunities, good life, new exciting societal changes, saving money, new consumption behavior, green growth, new jobs.
opinion polls consistently show that this is the kind of world most of us would like to be living in, and the particularly galling thing is that we already have the technologies and strategies with which to deliver it.
these are very basic and few simple measures every nation must implement only then we can accelarte the reduction of carbon foot print and speed up the transition to a carbon neutral society.
in the winter that’s handy as it adds to heating the space (unless of course you open and close your refrigerator a lot).
however, the sense of urgency for environmental problems is lower than these for functional problems and consequently socio-technical transitions to a carbon neutral society do not come about easily and need to be motivated by gradually developing integrative factors capable of maximizing utility.
a few of the billions presently being squandered on eor “sequestration” projects of benefit only to the oil companies should be plenty for a good start.
one way of using this lack of power and control to speed up transitions is to create visions, provide leadership, and seed pockets of change.

rotational grass crops (e.g. every fifth year) which are not required for use as animal fodder forms a special case.
another important point is that organic feedstock usually has a high moisture content.
since nobody can determine a transition towards a carbon neutral society, nobody can stop transitions.
if these targets are indeed to be met, we need currency, courage, choices and creativity.
prop 23 was voted down, but prop 26 passed – it requires a two-thirds vote to pass any new taxes on business, which will make it difficult to fund the climate change law.

pockets of change can provide the examples required to change people’s mindset and overcome their initial resistance to all things new.
developing countries should find it much easier to grow down a low-carbon path, since they don’t have the installed high-carbon legacy infrastructure that developed countries do.
this is especially true in the utilisation of coal since whether we like it or not, this industry will continue to expand over the next several decades.
the actions in germany and spain cutting back on subsidies for pv are a prime example of these business driven interests making claims of how fast costs will come down – which to date has not happened at the claimed rate.

re climate change – to have a global agreement with firm targets.
as we begin to implement efficient low carbon electricity on a large scale, we start to reduce the carbon emissions from other key sectors such as transport, including cars, trains and hgv’s.
this overall increase in ambient humidity by the inclusion of this “wet air” will eventually result in increased rainfall somewhere.
the fact sea water was 300 feet lower 10,000 years ago and the sahara desert was mostly a savannah indicates the effect of how climate change can change quickly over a relatively short period of time.
but five minutes of political bravura and years of consequent behavior on the active, adaptive and reactive level can make an import difference: taking a clear position, setting up the framework to do so, and acting in accordance.
for sectors like ours, 2050 is two paper machine investments away.
finally, we need sound urban planning and related infrastructure.
as any price on carbon would need to be legislated and enforced by the government, it would function similarly to a tax.
the poorest developing countries would experience a massive uplift in incomes, and even the already wealthy countries would get wealthier.
nobody wants to admit a mistake and change direction, especially when the funding apparatus is supervised by those invested in the mistake.
while i believe that the world should be moving to a sustainable energy base, i think we need to worry about the technical and economic realities of this conversion and not to act in a frenzied way to get there.

relatively small plants producing biomethane which is either fed into an existing nearby gas grid, or liquefied for efficient long distance transportation, in this respect have an edge over large biorefineries.
even though this is how we assure enough clean potable water for everyone, not just americans.
all together, one should thus stay realistic on the final goal – to much dreaming can only lead to diluting debates – and on realism on the ‘speed’ dimension.
we need a bottom-up groundswell that overwhelms (and shames) our recalcitrant governments into action and an effort focused on this level might pay more dividends than lobbying our government representatives in copenhagen, cancún or durban.
institutional shareholders were particularly unsupportive.
this cycle and the application of organic methods will actually help take carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it in the soil in large quantities for very long periods.
to one extent or another, these countries’ climate policies consist of the following: a long-term and consistent climate policy with clear and measurable ghg reduction targets, based on scientific data (“evidence-based policy”), employing diverse policy tools aimed at generating more efficient energy markets and increasing the share of renewable energy resources, and periodic review and reassessment.
nuclear is deeply unpopular and highly costly, it will only ever make a small contribution towards reducing our emissions.
the in-ability to feed the world’s population will cause economic and political conflict, disease, and famine.
they build on the idea of sustainable development, but they need to be translated into operational tools and processes, that have the power to make sustainability work.
first, government policy needs to be realigned in that direction, meaning incentives for fossil fuels need to be shifted to low-carbon alternatives and procurement policies need to reshaped and religiously implemented.
we all have refrigerators in our homes.
this means comparing not only the costs of making the fuel or energy carrier available, but also new infrastructure and vehicle costs.
share: dear avi, you have made very good comments.
serious market development of new low carbon products and energy generation systems is not going to happen until all this is in place and these activities would make more sense than excessive government sponsored research and development.
tomorrow might perhaps be different and better, given the growth rates of renewables industries, notwithstanding the languishing share prices of many renewables companies.
in the next few lines i will summarize some of the issues related to my field of research, which is high performance computing.

there is a broad recognition that governments are huge consumers of goods and services in their own right and sound procurement policies can build markets for low-carbon goods and services much as they did in the case of recycling and recycled content.
governments cannot simply subsidise energy production and consumption without any due regard for the negative externalities.
by working together, across sectors, and bringing the visionary level people together to see past this quarter into next year and beyond, there is a very real possibility of getting clean and green power to the eu from africa at prices comparable to 1990 us electricity prices.
but in the panic over global warming, post-combustion chemical co2 capture and underground co2 dumping (“sequestration”), biofuels, windmills, and solar — none of which are workable at utility scale for providing the baseload power the world needs — were rushed forward and absorbed all of the available money.
so long as there are so many ignorant, self-absorbed, greedy, and basically malevolent people, then there will always be these bizarre and wasteful “institutions.”
the rules and context are changing daily.
concisely then, if we are to increase the rate of transition to a more resource-friendly society, policies should promote individual technologies where their supply chain could be improved by the removal of market-based barriers.

tax to apply when used, i.e. also when burning fuels in a chp plant.
mining canadian oil sands in particular requires multibillion-dollar capital investments that are typically paid back over long periods, which means mines currently up and running – and there are many – will not be switched off overnight.
once individuals, businesses and politicians see it as in their best interest, we’ll be on the road.
pricing carbon, however, would have broader-reaching financial incentives for reducing carbon emissions.
for the latter, the most concerned sectors are heavy primary industries, construction and food.
the reason a 100% effect on incoming air was required of the system on just two components (co2 and particulates) was to assure the two competing dynamics within climate change remain in their present balance but become less intense.
producing less carbon means after all exactly a slowing down of economic industrial growth.
a highway replacement may not increase emissions, but it does seem to lock them in for the long term at a time when local, regional, and state governments are supposed to be doing everything they can to encourage use and investment in transit and reducing vehicle miles traveled.
yes, we need to clean up and sequester carbon from fossil-fuel-fired electrical generation facilities, and to revisit the desirability of both large and small nuclear plants.
another way to approach the issue is through initiating feed-in tariffs (fits).
it is essential to very carefully household with renewable resources which could be used to provide transportation fuels for mentioned applications.
in colorado, we have a mandate for distributed pv which is totally out of whack with central power generation costs.
simultaneously, however, they are committed to a rate of economic growth that even they recognize will cause climate-disrupting emissions to rise into the foreseeable future.
the rise of a ‘green economy’ is supposed to make the ‘carbon-neutral society’ happen, as it takes the links between economy, society and the environment into account and aims to boost and diversify our society, create employment opportunities, improve equity and foster sustainability.
by observing which specific chemicals it is possible to economically extract from a given plant species, it is reasonable to anticipate that the ability to invert the dynamics of the bioremediation system mentioned in cornerstone #2 above would be a potential source of chemicals for industry.

far from being an avoidable expense, the ccs sector has the potential to create thousands of uk jobs and contribute billions of pounds to our economy while helping to ensure a carbon neutral society.
whilst the financial gain of developing the new technologies that will underpin these sectors is undoubtable, all new innovations carry a development period.
our team came up with interesting insight how the ofice and factory planning can reduce the carbon print.
when pure h2o, contacts carbonic acid h2co3, the co2 molecule is broken off from the carbonic acid leaving water and co2 separate again, thus raising the ph and liberating a molecule of co2 from the seawater as it is raining at the surface.
it also means the end of policies that promote energy production based on its type and not on its actual resource footprint.
funding is also crucial for improving energy efficiency in buildings, which account for around 40% of eu carbon emissions.
the us did not ratify the kyoto protocol; most annex 1 countries have increased rather than reduced their emissions since 1989; china, india, brazil and other non-annex 1 countries have embarked on an unprecedented course of economic growth.

for aircraft there might also be a need to substitute oil based jet fuel with another synthetic liquid fuel produced from renewable resources.
recent data disclose the astonishing likelihood that, far from serving as an invaluable carbon sink, these decaying trees and deadfall will cause massive carbon-positive releases exactly coinciding with the decades during which we hope to best the climate-forcing challenge.
but in the meantime, i think the world would do well to add coal and natural gas to liquid to the mix of transportation fuels.
“national interests”(2) are too different and not always transparent to the observer, the prospects of a “win-win outcome” are virtually nonexistent, and the accumulating scientific data does not accelerate the “ripening” of discrepancies between the parties into a negotiated settlement.
money keeps on going to the same silly projects, like enhanced oil recovery (eor) in depleted reservoirs in the guise of “sequestration” to store co2 emissions.

faulty decisions or not, germany and other “pioneering states” confirm that good climate governance at the national level is possible and successful.
first, factors influencing the energy system are identified.
although distributed systems (clusters, supercomputers, grids, data centres and clouds) provide an unparalleled level of computational horsepower for solving challenging problems across a wide spectrum of fields—from scientific inquiry, engineering design, and financial analysis to national defence and disaster prediction—such horsepower usually equals enormous power consumption, not only to run the distributed system but also to cool it.
from the begning of industrial growth in early 1900, we have been depended on fossil fuels to feed our industries, to generate electricity, to fuel our vehicles and so on.
the project planning team has come up with the detailed cost estimates, with the construction cost is $223 per sq.
if we had to pay — either directly through charges to obtain allowances or taxes on emissions or indirectly via price signals on carbon intensive products — we would be motivated by our wallets to make more climate-friendly, carbon-neutral decisions.
nations are not the only players in the global climate game.
this will never will be possible without the intevention of both government and coorporate.
innovations that work towards lowering consumption on the individual or local scale have their place but they are simply not large enough to cause the fundamental shift required.
the co2 within the rising bubbles reacts with the limewater causing a precipitate of calcium carbonate to settle on the bottom permanently sequestering the co2.
instead they plan to prevent regulation of greenhouse gas emissions while increasing offshore oil drilling.

but of course this is not going to be popular.
reduction of carbon intensity is among real structural reforms needed for countries to have a prospect for development, and not reduction of pensions, child care allowances, education budget.
in the past however, governments have generally provided assistance in the form of complimentary infrastructure provision (e.g. the vast swathes of highways built after the u.s’ 1956 federal aid highway act helped truly embed motor vehicles as the private transport technology of choice).
factors are e.g. energy price dynamics, ecological constraints, international energy policy etc.
these are the technologies of the future; they will drive the second industrial revolution toward ecological modernization.
furthermore, the holistic approach of sa ensures that key sustainability topics (ranging from biodiversity conservation to poverty eradication) are not ‘lost’ in an overly narrow focus on carbon emissions alone.
by using several different methods combined, wholly or in part during a portion of the year determined by photoperiod & solar cycle, the existing nutrients in and around a lake can be drawn from their source.
pure biomethane for use in vehicles has to compete with natural gas, and the income from sales of biomethane at the price of natural gas is often lower than the income from almost raw biogas used for electric power generation.
these include the steps region in eastern europe, the great plains of north america, and the southeast asia rice bowl.
on the same day coal india shares started trading so too did enel green power’s.
during this time we have to see a responsible utilisation of fossil fuels; eliminating energy penalties for carbon capture and storage (ccs) and seeking new technologies that efficiently enable a large scale roll out of low carbon generating technology.
again, this spectacle involved fund managers investing and trading for people who, given a say, might well have chosen to factor climate change into the decisions taken.
sa also embodies the democratic values of sustainability, as it needs to be conducted in a participatory way.
because cruise lines use such enticements to get people to leave home (so they can experience all the comforts of home).
the fuel tax income should be primarily earmarked fuel and energy infrastructure developments, also for required modifications of chemical industry production facilities.

share: most of us could be persuaded that a carbon neutral society is a good thing, as much for the conservation of raw materials for future use as in mitigation of climate change.
many different techniques are initiated and discontinued in a very specific order, sequence, phase and period after which the area is then re-tested, plant species possibly adjusted then repeated annually for up to 40 years or more for heavily contaminated areas.
that means finding a balance between putting a price on carbon and leaving industry the funds to finance the future.
because the planetary population is well beyond sustainable levels, even a small increase causes much more than just a proportional increase in damage to our life support systems (4) – carbon storage systems such as forests and peatbogs, watersheds, and the atmosphere.
then there is india with its coal based economy, but also its biomass based economies in many of its villages.
yet, we have an alcohol tax, a tobacco tax, a lottery and gambling tax.
substituting wind and solar for coal and natural gas in providing baseload power is not going to happen because they are intermittent and isolated from the grid.
here, it’s clearly impossible for the forces advocating carbon neutrality to stand a chance in the national debate when big coal, big oil, and their shills have virtually limitless resources to flood the airwaves with self-serving propaganda.
his patent-pending technology allows for precise blending of petroleum-based fuels with biofuels and pumping directly into the end user’s vehicle.
putting water in the air, by putting air in the water in this way can only serve us all very well.
developing and implementing technologies which reduce the cost of producing low carbon electricity, coupled with long term guaranteed government subsidies funded by a small levy on electricity users, should naturally accelerate the introduction of these solutions.
price is the only thing that drives consumers.
the viable technologies that can assist with climate change mitigation and adaptation rest across most economic sectors, yet point to discrete solutions.
but we will not truly cross the bridge to a carbon neutral society until we can put in place a policy framework that favours it.
providing an adequate refuelling infrastructure for methane thus has a higher priority than setting up a similar infrastructure for hydrogen.

a recent study on power consumption by servers (the type used in cloud computing systems) shows that electricity use for servers worldwide—including their associated cooling and auxiliary equipment—in 2005 cost 7.2 billion us dollars.
second, the conditions that govern international investment often discourage investment in clean energy.
electric vehicles offer considerable potential for electricity storage when demand is low at night, as well as holding the key to decarbonising transport, which currently accounts for a quarter of all carbon emissions.
these, coupled with the development of advanced clean energy technologies, have converged and signify that vehicles like the chevrolet volt, 2011 car of the year, are here to stay.
yet the huge soot and co2 emissions from open fires of all sorts globally go almost unaddressed.
edison first brought in the light-bulb to the upper-class of lower manhattan by using a system of lines, substations and transformers, etc (johnson & suskewicz, 2009).
in the energy sector, sa can be used to assess the sustainability impacts of a wide range of initiatives, such as developing new power plants, assessing wind parks, assessing projects under the kyoto protocol’s flexible mechanisms, as our team did for clean development mechanism-projects in vietnam.
so too is the case of the 25 major corporations that signed a letter asking to us president to take more resolute action to lower global carbon emissions.
a constant daily public education about continuing climate change via mainstream media would help create and sustain the sense of urgency needed to develop and maintain a fast transition towards a carbon neutral society.(5)
what it means is that you are not a net contributor to global co2 emissions.
finally, i think a lot of this comes down to educating the public about energy – the pros and cons of different sources, the trade-offs that policymakers must make, the scale and inertia of the system, and the fact that cost matters.
this means finding a method that stops fossil fuels releasing co2, which can happen through the development of carbon capture and storage (ccs) power plants.
choices also involves the courage to support large pilot projects, jumping the valley of death of r&d.
networks of cities, national and international, are aiding their members with consultation, expertise and funding.
if we want to abate co2 and become a carbon neutral society, then the world needs a 9-11 wake-up call involving global food production.
if technologies for reducing carbon emissions are a profit opportunity rather than a cost burden a constructive tension will naturally speed up the transition.
but as of now we are short of good climate governance, and of the political will to put the available technological and policy tools into practice.
their case is instructive insofar as their climate policies exemplify the meaning and importance of “good governance”–to my mind the main stepping stone on the road to a carbon-neutral society.
the indulgences issued by the catholic church did not stop sin, and “carbon offsets” will not reduce co2 emissions.
the viable technologies that can assist with climate change mitigation and adaptation rest across most economic sectors, yet point to discrete solutions.
and claims are made that there is a cost saving in transmission – true; but when you put numbers to it, the added cost of distributed pv paid for by the ratepayers far exceeds the cost of added transmission.
imagine if major media avenues carried public service announcements daily on how homeowners or communities could cut their energy consumption, or transition to clean energy.
the size of the particles is directly linked to their potential to cause health problems.
for some mobile applications – aircraft, ships, and long distance road traffic we, however, still have the challenge of developing sufficiently efficient energy carriers.
on that cruise ship were 4500 other human beings, all being fed with food requiring refrigeration, powered by petroleum.
this option also has the benefit of providing inexpensive fertiliser for a small lot of land.
and the paybacks, once again, are enormous: improved incomes, better quality of life, and reduced climate risk, all around the world.
this is intended to ensure that we shall not allow the next time around a repeat of the “out-of-control acceleration away from origin” we have been inducing/experiencing since/with the industrial revolution.
a shift in taxation would drive behavioral change.
if this pearl in indian ocean can achieve this goal, then others can – provided given initiative and drive.
until international climate negotiations target bulk shipments of fossil fuels – for instance, the growth in liquefied natural gas – a carbon-neutral world will remain elusive.
first, the dollar figures probably look scary.
choices also involves the courage to support large pilot projects, jumping the valley of death of r&d.
we end up with energy, jobs, food and water, all at pre 2000 prices, and the ability to maintain those prices at less than eu100/mwh escalated at cost of living for the foreseeable future.
first, decelerating the current acceleration, reducing the movement towards constant speed.
going back to the oil embargo of the early 1970’s through three mile island and the exxon valdez.
for example; assume an area is contaminated with a given chemical that is economically recoverable from a specific type of plant.
the technologies and the market opportunities generated by this cooperation would attract other nations to enter into similar pacts to remain competitive, which in turn would facilitate the emergence and expansion of coalitions in future climate negotiations.
however, a real job that wind and solar might do is the conversion task, in electrolytic dissociation of co2 to make liquid fuel or elemental carbon, recycling the oxygen back into the plant for oxyfuel combustion or oxygen-blown gasification.
the “big push” of initial subsidies would result in renewable energy becoming the default investment option (without any subsidy) in just 10-20 years, at a price affordable to all.
apart from the multitude of ownerships of the different sites, a cloud differs from traditional high performance computing systems in the heterogeneity of the computing nodes as well as the communication links that connect the different nodes together.
julian robertson, chairman of tiger management llc, has famously stated that the simplest way to eliminate diabetes and control the obesity epidemic in the us – in addition to improving the gdp by as much as a trillion dollars – is to institute a sugar and fat tax.
the uppermost deck had a 40-foot by 20-foot big screen tv.
we absolutely must undertake the faster, more effective reduction of co2-equivalents by controlling these emissions, to buy time to get far less tractable co2 emissions reduced.
it is also essential for the nearby farmers who supply them to adopt organic methods that build the soil.
redesigning the existing buildings to reduce wastage of electricity.
the exact same equipment can be used to grow on the same scale the algae that produce omega-3 & omega-6 fatty acids.
there is a broad recognition that governments are huge consumers of goods and services in their own right and sound procurement policies can build markets for low-carbon goods and services much as they did in the case of recycling and recycled content.
the need for legislation is not just to be limited but to be systemic in all that governments do lack of costing of externalities.
unless the industrial policy for a globalised era, the innovation union and the raw material initiative of the eu deliver real support to industry, it will not be enough.
this could even be accomplished with a net zero carbon footprint within 10-15 years.
maybe money is still cheap.
carbon neutrality means not making the co2 problem worse as we satisfy the need for more power.
while critics believe global warming is a hoax, anyone with their eyes open can see the polar caps shrinking, glaciers melting on a world wide basis, and droughts being reported across the globe, including the amazon basin.
these stoves consume most of their carbon-containing gaseous emissions and generate stable; carbon-rich biochar that can be used to supplement the productivity of agricultural lands.
this is made even more difficult by the reality of what has worked so well for so long.
but, much positive effect on geopolitics, ocean acidification & cleanliness and climate change causing “contamination”.
these are the technologies of the future; they will drive the second industrial revolution toward ecological modernization.
there is no single solution to combat climate change, yet, collectively, cross-economy solutions from many industries will drive the new energy economy.
the actions in germany and spain cutting back on subsidies for pv are a prime example of these business driven interests making claims of how fast costs will come down – which to date has not happened at the claimed rate.
however, this support should be (a) competitively based, e.g. through competitions/auctions (b) time-limited, or (as with solar subsidies) declining with time on a set schedule, until the technology is competitive (c) targeted towards results/performance rather than a prescribed technical approach.
current targets within the uk, whilst sounding impressive, only follow the level recommended to give a 50% chance of avoiding disaster.
thus far, the epa has been less than motivated to return our calls let alone actually help us with this.
i spend most of my professional day working to clear lawsuits, regulatory red tape and policy barriers out of the way and to obtain the myriad of financial incentives federal and state governments offer green technologies.
second, we must begin paying the full price for energy we do consume.
in the transportation sector, in a place like the united states with long distances, we have no viable solution in which we can have faith for success; though we should be funding r&d and first order deployment for electrics, cellulosic ethanol, algae and my own hope – some form of artificial photosynthesis which converts air, water and solar energy to a liquid fuel.
today the coal cars can be empty for putting the “green coal” (algae press cake) back into the ground.
most likely in every industry sector we need to change government r&d support from focusing on many small projects towards shifting to a limited number of very large projects with large support.
fundaments of consumption evolving mechanisms are staying intact.
we need not worry about covering every square mile of the seas with these machines.
keep burning coal at anything like the rate we do today, and such events will compound until they destroy wealth faster than it can be created.
economic modeling demonstrated that a “big push” strategy, while it looked expensive relative to the levels of aid and investment on offer in the global negotiating process, paid enormous dividends.
at the same time, investment bankers will be back in their casinos with barely a light slap on their wrists after nearly plunging the world into depression in 2008.
with the architecture greatly reducing the hvac loads, the teams have designed an ultra-efficient, in-slab, radiant heating and cooling system that is integrated with an under floor air distribution system.
instead, it offers a strong incentive to move the other way.
furthermore, industries must be allowed to collapse if they cannot stand on their own two feet.
the challenge is therefore how to get our co2 emissions down at the lowest cost – not how to reduce emissions in the way most acceptable to greenpeace or the coal lobby or china or us farmers or any other special interest group.
however, the problem is completely different in the case of cloud computing systems.
in addition to system homogeneity, tasks are often homogeneous or independent.
we are just too tied into hydrocarbons in our energy systems, agricultural systems and more.
share: in my view, achieving a carbon neutral society will require the uptake of emerging technologies within the power generating sector.
india and china, for example, have recently become big polluters, but when you take into consideration that the west has been polluting the air for hundreds of years, it becomes clear that we cannot now impose identical regulations on them.
yes, it can create new export-oriented industries.
chefs are equally careful about sharpening their knives.
our book shows that our nation can realize huge savings and create new employment through transitioning to a carbon neutral society.
the development of low carbon technologies that are commercially preferable would lead to wide scale adoption without a reliance on the environmental argument.
they involve things like zero-carbon homes, electric cars used as mobile energy storage plants, smart grids to optimise power use, and green bonds for financing the whole thing.
through feed-in tariffs, developers of renewable energy technologies are given incentives, and utilities are given a mandate to use these renewable energy sources.
we absolutely must undertake the faster, more effective reduction of co2-equivalents by controlling these emissions, to buy time to get far less tractable co2 emissions reduced.
we end up paying very heavily for things like solar power and offshore wind, while neglecting quick, low-cost options like industrial heat & power, improved energy efficiency, and switching from coal to gas.
an electric car, for example, engineered to be lightweight, strong and recyclable, provides a technological solution to a low carbon lifestyle when powered by clean electricity.
energy independence and access are major drivers for the implementation of clean technology practices, with energy source diversification a key, long-term indicator of sustainable economic growth.
politicians will do whatever it takes to get elected and stay in power.
indeed, in this case it is not so much a gamble as a known outcome, if you believe the vast majority of climate scientists.
not if you already know that non-co2 emissions, primarily methane, hydrofluorocarbons, smog-causing ozone and dark soot particles, cause just under half of all climate-forcing, which means that the strategies we discuss the most address only about half the problem.
awea reports 78% growth in 2008.
the only practical way for cities to do this is once again to rely on the areas surrounding them for their food.
a possible refinement would be to apply a higher rate for coal than for oil, and a lower rate for natural gas than for oil, in order to accelerate the transition to low carbon fuels.
a few of the billions presently being squandered on eor “sequestration” projects of benefit only to the oil companies should be plenty for a good start.
dynamic labelling of energy-using products produces substantial energy savings but the current eco-design directive is behind schedule and lacks ambition.
while the epa in the u.s. finalizes plans for ghg regulations in high emission industries, china has made energy efficiency and lower emissions per unit of gdp a national priority.
however, as soon as visions are being shared, leadership becomes a motor for change, and local practitioners start to implement, transitions can easily become historic turning points.
still, germany’s climate policies are considered “pioneering”, and justifiably so.
emissions -power technology: improve the efficiency of power production, distribution and storage -renewable energy: power generation using natural resources that are naturally replenished -low carbon commerce: businesses which lower ghg emissions for global commerce and consumption -water: water treatment, purification, desalination and distribution abraham lincoln said: “if i had eight hours to cut down a tree, i’d spend six hours sharpening my axe.”
while a lofty goal, striving towards carbon neutrality will further enable the great energy revolution, of which we are in the early stages.
saving energy is the most cost-efficient way of cutting greenhouse gas emissions.
battery banks would provide back-up storage for when neither wind nor solar energy is available.
both countries have invested billions into green energy whereas the eu has not even started discussing how to fund its strategic energy technology plan, the initiative designed to accelerate development, demonstration and deployment of low carbon technologies.
the system also uses limewater for reasons of low expense, near zero toxicity, and simplicity.
factors are e.g. energy price dynamics, ecological constraints, international energy policy etc.
for example, automotive manufacturer nissan is soon to release its nissan leaf electric car in the 2011 model year, and is receiving orders from consumers sight-unseen, with current demand much greater than manufacturing capacity.
it is indeed not a technocratic set of fabulous four alone that will scale the exhaust down.
but in the meantime, i think the world would do well to add coal and natural gas to liquid to the mix of transportation fuels.
the transition to a carbon neutral society will cost money.
climate change is a global phenomenon; it is only natural to respond internationally.
hope that new technologies will be adopted simply because they are cleaner relies too strongly on public, business and government desire for green options.
share: given the current trajectory of world energy demand with non-oecd economic growth and associated demographic trends, a carbon neutral society will be an extreme challenge for the public and private sectors to meet.
but we have a number of ways to accommodate different technical issues relating to coal, diesel, biomass, ethanol and natural gas fired power generation all with the same end result, green power generation for all.
accepting that there are a large number of counteracting forces at play, and also that politicians will generally act to remain in power, there still is an onus on current policy-makers to begin pricing fuel and power at prices that will entail some compromise on those that provide and those that use the services of heat, electricity and transportation.
in this approach, given a set of tasks and a set of resources (e.g., processors and disks)—typically energy consumption/savings associated with each element in both sets is identified—these preprocessed tasks are then prioritized, matched with resources, and scheduled while complying with constraints if any.
country by country, feed-in tariff mechanisms are already law (well over 50 countries already have it), or in the process of becoming law, in countries as diverse as kenya, egypt, serbia, and byelorussia.
in practice, this is all likely to prove highly politically difficult, for a number of reasons: countries differ in their carbon intensity and how hard they will be hit by climate change; domestic lobby groups oppose carbon pricing or agitate for subsidies for pet projects; border carbon taxation threatens the global system of free trade and wto rules; etc.
those ending up owning stock include 484 foreign funds, 195 mutual funds, 44 insurance companies, and many banks.
this kind of governance not only brings carbon at neutral also contribute to world democracy indirectly.
in a civilisation intent on ensuring its own survival, much less prosperity, we would be using home-made sources of renewable energy, with great efficiency and fairness, and investing our own money to roll out ever more green infrastructure with which to build resilient local and national economies, so creating worthwhile jobs for our children.
addressing overpopulation by asserting the reproductive rights of all women through developing a global program that provides contraceptive education and choices for all women.
apart from the multitude of ownerships of the different sites, a cloud differs from traditional high performance computing systems in the heterogeneity of the computing nodes as well as the communication links that connect the different nodes together.
knowing we have little time, we should still find a system that leaves the door open for solutions that might look crazy today, but might make a lot of sense tomorrow.
there is no single solution to combat climate change, yet, collectively, cross-economy solutions from many industries will drive the new energy economy.
opinion polls consistently show that this is the kind of world most of us would like to be living in, and the particularly galling thing is that we already have the technologies and strategies with which to deliver it.
as recent events once again demonstrate, the german public does not particularly like nuclear energy, especially the shipping of nuclear waste.
another suggestion is to form coalitions between “pioneering states” and “willing developing countries”, which would entail technological, capacity-building and financial assistance, joint clean-tech ventures and more.
to eliminate stratification & passively oxygenate the volume of the lake’s water, a device equating to a smaller version of cornerstone #3 was originally created to be part of this bioremediation system.
the existing power entity is only generating power at approximately 5% of original capacity and in effect becomes a “licensed co2 producer” in support of the downstream processes.
the technologies and the market opportunities generated by this cooperation would attract other nations to enter into similar pacts to remain competitive, which in turn would facilitate the emergence and expansion of coalitions in future climate negotiations.
finally, bringing the climate challenge back to north america, we have yet to give serious attention to the enormous releases of co2 from the dead and now decaying us and canadian forests devastated by the pine bark beetle.
this diversification of value streams gives greater stability to the alternative fuels industry and by extension, the economy as a whole.
they are also permitted – as the coal india ipo shows – to gamble with the global climate in the course of their routine advisory business, bringing coal to the markets by the gigatonne, without the requirement for a single item of liability accounting on the global balance sheet.
our interest for development without considering carbon factor is the main cause of the problem.
the design of such protocols for cloud systems is further complicated by the fact that the different sites in a cloud system are likely to have different capabilities.
as the earth warms, droughts will return to our breadbasket areas.
we should stop rating countries based on physical and economic development for example “nepal is one of the poor countries…” rather we should start saying “nepal is one of the environmentally rich countries…” we need to develop some kind of world governance that will be able to tax for more carbon emission and reward for less.
the logic here also builds on historical examples, such as the rapid drop in computer chip prices that was engineered by the u.s. government through its purchasing policy in the 1960s.
policy changes supporting low-carbon and low-energy initiatives, including additional federal and state incentives for renewable energy, could bring zero emissions buildings much closer to our grasp.
i believe the us automobile fleet accounts for nearly the same amount of energy use.
characteristics like the building massing, orientation, floor-to-floor height, window sizes, and quality of glass and landscaping all are optimized to ensure that the building can be illuminated without electricity during daylight hours.
despite industry improvements, this continues to pose a significant problem for air quality.
governments don’t have the strongest influence as they tend to be driven by short term cycles and fear of re-election.
therefore in the meantime, we have to work with what we have – fossil fuels.
we are paying the fine for our intensive energy generation from the ground fuel, and to speed the international society against the carbon emission we have to show real encouragements for first; to go back to the hydrogen basic atom which needs research, action and investment, second; we have to shift immediately to the alternative energy sources like wind, solar and water waves, third enables the people to offset their emissions from travel and lifestyle choices by allowing them to contribute money towards projects that reduce or remove greenhouse gas i.e. co2 ones., while from my side i did a number of useful researches to the carbon precipitation: 1-jamel, m. a. m: ‘effect of electric field on fine charged particles precipitation’, gas cleaning at high temperature symposium, university of surry, september 27-29 uk (1993).
accordingly, the high performance computing research community started exploring green distributed computing as a way to achieve autonomic energy and power savings with little to no impact on performance.
in conclusion, sustainability assessment can be a powerful process that allows decision-makers to structure complex ‘hot societal topics’

what the bottom cleaner does is gather and deposit for collection all of the calcium carbonate.
the us did not ratify the kyoto protocol; most annex 1 countries have increased rather than reduced their emissions since 1989; china, india, brazil and other non-annex 1 countries have embarked on an unprecedented course of economic growth.
this will not cost much.
consider, right along with lost carbon sequestration from global deforestation, the huge related contribution to atmospheric co2 each day from slash-and-burn land clearing and the woody-mass-fueled cook fires used by three billion people in the developing world.
myth #2: we can’t go wrong by planting trees.
this same type of timing model is used with terrestrial plants around the shoreline and as far out as contamination, access and funding allow.
we need to stop mixing up climate policy with all kinds of other campaigns – for wealth redistribution, population control, anti-capitalism or anti-big business, a less “consumerist” society etc – that just alienate large parts of society, the business community and major developing countries.
in 2006, he realized that the federal government created emissions mandates to take effect in 2010, for which it had no set standards and no infrastructure with which to implement and track compliance.
notwithstanding politics, misunderstandings and a few other minor, (sic), details, i could pencil out a plan that could be developed using the principles of essential sustainability today.
the final output may be fine, so do some of the intermediaries.
no differentiation depending upon fuel user (industries, homes, agriculture, or transportation sector).
another place of potentially great benefit would be the great barrier reef in australia.
the only invention required is how to get along with each other long enough for all of us to win.
this process was designed to consume the maximum amount of co2 from industrial sources and produce the maximum amount of algae for fuels.
carbon neutral society helps to do so.
as of this writing algae based biofuels can easily be produced at or very near the point of use with our equipment.
the call for greater energy efficiency, reduced oil imports, and more livable cities is already significantly reducing carbon emissions per unit of gdp.
the rate at which it functions is directly dependent on wind speed.
no national economy can remain competitive and viable without developing them, producing or purchasing them and using them–in short, breaking the path to a carbon-neutral society.
we need a system that draws investments towards europe, urgently.
energy independence and access are major drivers for the implementation of clean technology practices, with energy source diversification a key, long-term indicator of sustainable economic growth.
if we really want to speed the transition to a carbon neutral society, we would be foolish to pin our hopes on the unfccc process.
firstly, a price on carbon emissions would create a revenue stream for the country.
the public policy goal of lowered ghg emissions is not likely to be relevant to the case.
hence, to the developing world this means yet another unethical barrier that the north and west (as it were) put on the rights the south and east have to develop.
that was just one of the many ships sailing that part of the earth’s waters, in that period of time.
a recent study on power consumption by servers (the type used in cloud computing systems) shows that electricity use for servers worldwide—including their associated cooling and auxiliary equipment—in 2005 cost 7.2 billion us dollars.
developing transitional energy policies, such as a temporary shift from coal to natural gas usage while we develop clean renewable energy infrastructure, and retraining fossil fuel workers to work in the carbon-free energy industry.
pragmatic problem solving interdisciplinary scientific approaches may be required beyond our (societal) internal readiness or ability to “engineer” (or simply allow) them.
we need a system that draws investments towards europe, urgently.
such shifts not only influence consumer preferences and values but also create credibility pressure on and legitimacy for policy makers to introduce regulations, motivating development of new goals and subsequently use science and technology to adjust the economic sub-system, and address market failures with policy instruments such as environmental taxes, subsidies and tradable permits; however, it is necessary to focus on rational resource allocation decisions under the existing conditions of scarcity.
in the next few lines i will summarize some of the issues related to my field of research, which is high performance computing.
as to transportation, where there is high population density, public transit makes a lot of sense; but for much of the world, we need to bridge current resources of liquid fuel (including ctl/gtl) while we continue to work on “inventions” in the areas of electric, biofuels and artificial photosynthesis.
increase population density in all new urban development, lessening the burden on rural and forested areas • end all subsidies and tax breaks for chemically-intensive and irresponsible food and livestock production • end all subsidies and tax breaks for uncontrolled and irresponsible (non-sustainable) land development • reduce military spending by 50% immediately, and, phase down from there, thereby ending our costly protection of (other countries’) natural resources and fossil fuels the us needs to satisfy our rampant consumption •
learn from marketing and advertising industries, as they have fantastic success in making people change their behaviors.
there will likely not be a meeting of the minds or a fully functioning and agreed upon global treaty with any real effect on this issue because the world is a place of great variety in energy use, economic development, educational development, and just plain views of the world and its problems.
look for natural gas-fired power plants to gradually replace coal as the electricity-generating mainstay in western countries.
furthermore, energy demand globally is driven by non-oecd countries, as their energy consumption passed oecd energy consumption back in 2006.
it got a lot worse with the recent supreme court decision that repealed contribution limits for corporations and unions.
depending on the stove, replacing a cook fire with a clean-burning stove can eliminate one to four tons of co2 emissions a year.
it is not enough to turn the tanker around, but it is enough to keep hope alive and make continuing negotiations worthwhile.

there is no charge for any information we provide.
the consequential benefits from doing this go way beyond the energy sector.
the system then adjusts through changes in goal attainment and adaptation-functions and settles down in a new equilibrium.
life was simpler then, and we had less “stuff”.
in effect, the country does not emit more co2 than it absorbs.
as has been seen throughout history, need will drive new innovation and i have every belief that development is already underway on the new technologies that will drive our low carbon future.
while the cost incurred by the utilities would initially be passed down to their customersonce carbon is priced in the marketplace, renewable energy sources will be incorporated on a mass scale, bringing their coststo grid parity, and energy prices will go down.
the simple solution is, of course, the worldwide introduction of a tax regime which makes renewable energy commercially more attractive than fossil fuels.
this way, the transition of employees from one skill set to another isn’t a huge problem down the road.
its national leaders, including many engineers, recognize how climate change is already damaging their society, and will do so catastrophically as it continues.
:)) and the eu selling a 100s of billions of dollars of new equipment that can be paid for out of the energy savings we can generate.
today, the earth barely supports over 6 billion people from crops grown on only 10% of the earth’s surface.
many of these investors were using ordinary citizens’ money, and this would have included the nest eggs of people worried about global warming and its dire impact on the world by the time they retire.
because technology will never be implemented in the public farther than the public acceptance of it.
yet despite the logic of starting with energy efficiency, it is the (non-binding) 20% energy efficiency target which is the 2020 goal most likely to be missed.
renewables will one day be the answer but won’t be ready, at least on the scale we need it, for a good few decades.
but for now the coal india ipo illustrates the enormity of the mountain we have to climb in order to arrive there.
if we want to abate co2 and become a carbon neutral society, then the world needs a 9-11 wake-up call involving global food production.
networks of cities, national and international, are aiding their members with consultation, expertise and funding.
this is true, and it means that those of us who have hitherto not grown any food will be called upon to grow at least some of our diet–in kitchen gardens, community plots and small farms.
they build on the idea of sustainable development, but they need to be translated into operational tools and processes, that have the power to make sustainability work.
to get there we’re going to need to completely change the way we operate, particularly when it comes to producing energy.
the best part for all is that nobody has to look for a new job.
my favorite electric grid generation approach – csp, solar thermal has built in storage and is probably less expensive to build than pv per kwh.
accordingly, the high performance computing research community started exploring green distributed computing as a way to achieve autonomic energy and power savings with little to no impact on performance.
myth #3: photovoltaic panels are effective only in bright, sunny, warm climates like california’s.
this, in turn, results in extremely large electricity bills and reduced system reliability [1].
let’s not look in the old places, at the old solutions, let’s look forward and be brave.
biochar can be helpful, but is not a substitute for the broad conversion of industrial farming to smaller scale organic farming.
urban planning, the replacement of antiquated urban infrastructures and the development of institutional capacities can produce significant ghg reductions and lead to relatively rapid changes in residents’ energy consumption and behaviors.
unless the industrial policy for a globalised era, the innovation union and the raw material initiative of the eu deliver real support to industry, it will not be enough.
then look at africa, which is mostly biomass based.
confirm that good climate governance at the national level is possible and successful.
ground-level ozone is a respiratory irritant that is the most problematic in the summer months.
the in-ability to feed the world’s population will cause economic and political conflict, disease, and famine.
the answer is that we are short of good climate governance.
the northern reaches of the province are also home to the world’s second-largest proven reserves of oil after saudi arabia, and international firms from exxonmobil to total sa are busy pouring money into clawing the sticky black goo called bitumen from underneath vast tracts of boreal forest.
thus, reaching global carbon-neutrality also involves replacing open cook fires with the simple, efficient biomass-burning cook stoves available today.
so long as you are targeting high profits in the very short-term, you can feel free to fry our childrens’ future and to use our citizens’ money to bankroll the cooking fat.
it requires policies and social marketing that target behavioral changes in industry and business and also consumers, since in the end it is us as consumers, citizens, and shareholders who will direct the trsansition.
i’m here to help bioremediate co2 and other chemicals from the environment and show how we can easily use wind-power to restore life to the oceans.
the proportion of direct and indirect urban ghg emissions in the global greenhouse gas household exceeds sixty percent.

share: for the past 34 years i have had the opportunity to work in the petroleum industry as a reservoir engineer.
most likely in every industry sector we need to change government r&d support from focusing on many small projects towards shifting to a limited number of very large projects with large support.
the eu emissions trading system will not deliver on its own.
first, government policy needs to be realigned in that direction, meaning incentives for fossil fuels need to be shifted to low-carbon alternatives and procurement policies need to reshaped and religiously implemented.
yet we almost certainly will fail, unless we act to keep the huge amount of carbon stored in these dead forests from escaping.
while the epa in the u.s. finalizes plans for ghg regulations in high emission industries, china has made energy efficiency and lower emissions per unit of gdp a national priority.

the other source we must rely, though not limit ourselves, is the solar energy.
for many developing countries i would, however, at the same time support the use of domestic scale waste based biogas production to allow smoke free cooking and heating, and avoiding the daily challenge of finding suitable fuels.
the payback would be less than 10 years today in the many other areas where electricity is more expensive.
upgrading the grid is therefore a priority, in order to ensure adequate transmission and distribution systems.
we’re primarily producing fuel and supplementing any shortfall of profit by producing higher value algae in relatively small quantities.
the last carbon neutral society may have been the hunter gathers.
the second factor is the detailing of how efficient technologies can be brought in to replace the embedded systems.
each cabin, of which there were possibly 200 on each of 6 of the 13 decks, had a tv hanging on the wall.
the study also indicates that this electricity consumption in that year had doubled compared with consumption in 2000
however there is, i believe, a way in which market decisions can lead us to a low carbon approach, without a reliance on the strength of environmental conscience or strict legislation that is unlikely to come.
excessive consumption is cultivated in all society and induced by mechanisms of free market for a long time.
when all is installed and running, only the co2 necessary to grow the algae needed to power the secondary generation system is newly produced.
consumer patters have to change, value chains redesigned, renewable materials used for production and in balance with their use for energy.
as to transportation, where there is high population density, public transit makes a lot of sense; but for much of the world, we need to bridge current resources of liquid fuel (including ctl/gtl) while we continue to work on “inventions” in the areas of electric, biofuels and artificial photosynthesis.
finally, we need sound urban planning and related infrastructure.
but we will never achieve a carbon-neutral society unless we push very hard on other strategies that have nothing to do with electrical generation, industrial ghg emissions quotas or, for that matter, even co2 emissions themselves.
to prevent bundled activities, e.g. retail incentives, distorting the outcome, i believe we should follow the german example which prohibits sale of items at below cost.
in the largest ever initial public offering on the indian stock exchange, coal india, a huge government-owned coal company, recently offered 10% of its shares to investors at home and abroad.
the ship, i was told, weighed 130,000 tons, and measured 1004 feet in length.
as the air bubble reaches the surface it will contain more water vapor by volume than the ambient air.
the last statement above offers a solution to the problem that several national governments since many years apply an incentive scheme offering a guaranteed feed in tariff for electricity generated via only partially cleaned biogas (sulphur, siloxanes and moisture removed from raw biogas), whereas pure biomethane, upgraded at a significant cost, and fit for grid injection (or for direct use in vehicles) is not provided with any additional support.
if this rate continues, the heat (per square centimetre) produced by future intel processors would exceed that of the surface of the sun; this implies the possibility of worsening system reliability, eventually resulting in poor system performance.
instead of designing whimsical structures with high-tech sustainable features tacked on, we need to create simpler, more humanistic buildings that fit into their neighbourhoods while performing in a way our society so desperately needs.
this would presumably enable each nation to make rational-choice decisions about their positions in upcoming cop negotiations.
there the big push strategy looks to the successful example of the green revolution, with its army of technical experts, extension workers, trainers, and support mechanisms of other kinds, which helped whole countries retool their agricultural systems with amazing speed.
this would speed up the transition to a carbon neutral society.
“national interests”(2) are too different and not always transparent to the observer, the prospects of a “win-win outcome” are virtually nonexistent, and the accumulating scientific data does not accelerate the “ripening” of discrepancies between the parties into a negotiated settlement.
cornerstone #1 commercial scale production of algae based drop-in petroleum replacements: using the continuous cultivation system for microalgae designed by scipio biofuels in a de-centralized model the system can, due to the ability of the system to consume xx,xxx+ tons annually of co2.
methane, a valuable fuel and main constituent of natural gas, has a gwp of 25 and is released from landfills, livestock, coal mines, rice paddies and leaky gas pipelines.
leed certified new buildings are built with a sustainability eye.
chefs are equally careful about sharpening their knives.
i can’t see that the economies, engineering, technological and other systems we have can be pushed to carbon neutrality without some serious problems if this is done too quickly.
courage is needed next to currency.
when considering the relative attractiveness of the three main alternatives – methane, hydrogen, and electric power – cost efficiency for avoided ghg emissions on a well-to-wheels basis, should be expressed per tonne of co2 avoided.
algae can produce feed stocks for many industries including plastics, cosmetics and many more.
every time we travel or turn on our computers, every time we travel or turn on our computers, we add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.
they are permitted to gamble once again with the global economy in the course of their routine investment business, this time knowing that the citizenry will be there to bail them out again.
to get all the way to zero emissions, the designs usually rely on of photovoltaic panels spread across the roofs of the office bars and parking garage, as well as integrated into the south-facing shading devices.

given that a consensual but implausible agreement is the only way to establish an international climate regime, political scientists and economists are exploring alternative, not necessarily multilateral arrangements.
by using a floating, wind driven apparatus to inject pressurized ambient air at a given ocean depth, the dynamic we are manufacturing artificially is that of crashing waves, or artificial wave action.
by having a plentiful supply of food, it’s the one common thread that keeps the human race civilized without becoming a pack of animals reverting back to our primal primitive instincts.
i personally would prefer to promote change through education, well argued persuasion and development of an enlightened public.
note that the emphasis here, as detailed in the first bullet, is to make clean energy cheap, not dirty energy more expensive.
i spend most of my professional day working to clear lawsuits, regulatory red tape and policy barriers out of the way and to obtain the myriad of financial incentives federal and state governments offer green technologies.
when carefully applied, sa helps to think out of the box and can be a significant step to help to steer the chain of actions towards a much-needed transition.
i think we can all agree that global climate change is an import issue, even with the uncertainty associated with possible future effects and results.
another suggestion is to form coalitions between “pioneering states” and “willing developing countries”, which would entail technological, capacity-building and financial assistance, joint clean-tech ventures and more.
my directors come from arup, conoco phillips, ch2mhill, corus/tata europe, e.on, lafarge, ondeo, shell, and wsp.
burning biomass to provide heat and electricity is clearly not the right way to go in the long term.
taxing the private yachts, g6s, bmw 7 series, etc., would mean that the wealthy would have to pay for using big carbon emitters, and this would help decrease the gap between them and those less privileged.
scheduling and resource allocation in distributed systems play a major role in finding the best task–resource matches in time and space based on a given objective function without violating a given set of constraints.
depending on the stove, replacing a cook fire with a clean-burning stove can eliminate one to four tons of co2 emissions a year.
ergo, it is in another way potentially possible to turn a profit by cleaning up our environment and recycling chemicals once thought, “consumed”.
in managing the essex global environmental opportunities strategy (geos), we take a thematic approach to environmental investing, and have developed nine themes that we believe capture the opportunities stemming from global climate change mitigation and adaptation.
to completely divorce financial viability from petroleum pricing, we grow nutriceuticals of a much greater value.
the fact the human race is causing an increase should be of no great surprise.
and invest the fund managers did, unfettered by risk regulation or any meaningful requirement to place a value on the climate consequences of their scramble for short-term profit.
enormous quantities of refrigerant escape to the atmosphere from leaks and junking wrecks and retired vehicles.
cornerstone #6 emissions free (almost) electrical power generation that preserves current upstream contracts.
a clean technology that performs the same function at a lower cost will be rapidly adopted, not because of its environmental credentials but simply because it is cheaper.
during this time frame, i have evaluated reservoirs all over the world from cambrian through tertiary geologic time frames and all have the same types of transgressive and regressive cycles associated with sea water rise and fall.
post-combustion technology may play an important role as it provides an abatement solution to the existing power stations that are emitting tonnes of co2 every day.
sadly, i think time is too short and we need to be steered by our baser motives.
so far, the will to move forward has been lacking because of a lack of this vision.
finally, bringing the climate challenge back to north america, we have yet to give serious attention to the enormous releases of co2 from the dead and now decaying us and canadian forests devastated by the pine bark beetle.
instead they plan to prevent regulation of greenhouse gas emissions while increasing offshore oil drilling.
most of the technologies for the transition to a carbon-neutral society already exist, among others renewable energy resources, energy efficiency in housing and transportation, heat exchange systems and climate-friendly infrastructures.
without it, we can’t survive.
our interest for development without considering carbon factor is the main cause of the problem.
during this time frame, i have evaluated reservoirs all over the world from cambrian through tertiary geologic time frames and all have the same types of transgressive and regressive cycles associated with sea water rise and fall.
the option which in the short term would have the greatest potential to limit co2 emissions, and reduce the dependence upon oil, is methane – initially mainly natural gas, but successively with an increasing share of renewable biomethane.
another refinement would be to marginally adjust the fuel tax with regard to presence of pollutants (e.g. sulphur).
as a matter of fact, the solar panels are more efficient in cooler climates—heat is their enemy.
it is possible to generate, algae oil (or green crude) for algae based biofuels in the tens, to tens of thousands of tons per day depending on the number of pbr’s at a given facility and other factors.
even the fourth assessment report issued in 2007 by the ippc, the very scientific body founded by the unfccc to support international climate policy by producing (increasingly disturbing) data for cop negotiators, fails to sufficiently impress policymakers in the international community.
a raised floor offers flexibility for a multi-tenant layout.
maybe money is still cheap.
in cancún, later this year, the world’s governments will return to their annual climate summit completely stymied on even the smallest cuts in greenhouse emissions.
in fact, the iea says, natural gas is the only fossil fuel for which demand is higher in 2035 than it was in 2008.
it’s widely acknowledged that with a republican majority, there’s no chance for energy and climate change legislation.
removal of the mats occurs just before photoperiod decreases sharply at summer’s end.
and if you have public consent, real acceptance, then there is room for new research budgets, new volunteering, and better solutions can even be discovered.
in the transportation sector, in a place like the united states with long distances, we have no viable solution in which we can have faith for success; though we should be funding r&d and first order deployment for electrics, cellulosic ethanol, algae and my own hope – some form of artificial photosynthesis which converts air, water and solar energy to a liquid fuel.
hopefully, the us will not need to reach those crisis levels before going into action.
more than half of us already dwell in urban areas; this concerns us individually as well as collectively.
they are therefore left to conscience and the ability to afford them.
that means finding a balance between putting a price on carbon and leaving industry the funds to finance the future.
share: my personal opinion on this question is that not much will really happen unless governments use quite heavy-handed carrot and stick approaches on ordinary businesses and consumers.
the answer for me to speed up transition to a more energy conscious society is to start educating our children from the very beginning how they use energy and how they can use less.
the government has not engaged its citizens in a dialogue, i.e. has fallen short of adhering to the tenets of transparency and public participation.
back-up power is again necessary.
i’m in this not to get rich.

the northern reaches of the province are also home to the world’s second-largest proven reserves of oil after saudi arabia, and international firms from exxonmobil to total sa are busy pouring money into clawing the sticky black goo called bitumen from underneath vast tracts of boreal forest.
about 30% of the projected 2030 total u.s. energy demand could be met by converting 2% of the land in nevada, new mexico and arizona to solar thermal farms.
the fact sea water was 300 feet lower 10,000 years ago and the sahara desert was mostly a savannah indicates the effect of how climate change can change quickly over a relatively short period of time.
the increased oxygen levels from the simulated wave action will both attract sealife and reduce algae concentrations.
in addition, the lifestyle changes we would have to make as individuals in the western world are so great they are unlikely to arise from personal choice alone; i expect there are few who would willingly opt for a lower quality of life.
in this approach, given a set of tasks and a set of resources (e.g., processors and disks)—typically energy consumption/savings associated with each element in both sets is identified—these preprocessed tasks are then prioritized, matched with resources, and scheduled while complying with constraints if any.
a similar advantage applies for the residuals from the biofuel production which will usually find use as fertiliser or fodder.
municipalities affect the lives of city residents in ways that the national authorities cannot.
given that a consensual but implausible agreement is the only way to establish an international climate regime, political scientists and economists are exploring alternative, not necessarily multilateral arrangements.
until international climate negotiations target bulk shipments of fossil fuels – for instance, the growth in liquefied natural gas – a carbon-neutral world will remain elusive.
zero emissions aren’t possible for a conventional project budget.
keep burning coal at anything like the rate we do today, and such events will compound until they destroy wealth faster than it can be created.
secondly, sa can also be a practical tool to assess concrete projects (e.g. energy projects).
others, such as ngos, do their best but obviously have little direct influence on the emission of ghg.

as we become more technologically-advanced, introducing more and more new gadgets, we increase our dependence on, and, our degradation of, our planet’s resources.
finding political solutions which would support the solution of all of the above indicated targets generally speaking energy supply is not really a problem.
in sum, the inept conduct of the international community certainly does not constitute “good [global] climate governance”, however one defines the term.
per capita incomes would rise much faster than a business-as-usual scenrio — in every region of the world.
so, we must differentiate between all behaviours and activities that generate carbon cost and those that do not and apply direct costs to undesirable activities.
consumers will start making impactful choices very quickly, organisations will rapidly develop alternatives to avoid being left behind and market subsidies will quickly disappear as subsidy funding, carbon costly activities die out and beneficial activities achieve cost efficiencies to replace diminishing subsidies.
the success of many cities in reducing ghg emissions demonstrates that effective climate change policy is possible at the urban level as well.
europe can increase the amount of electricity produced by wind power by * creating a single european market in electricity; * extending, upgrading and better inter-connecting europe’s national grids; * speeding up permitting procedures for wind farms and electricity grids.
only a shared vision that we really can pull together, and push hard on a big problem.
so it is mandatory to build public acceptance that will create agreements that will make possible new technologies, new paradigm to arise.
yes, the world needs an effective global climate regime, if not the kyoto framework then something else as acceptable.
to make it happen “fast enough” requires placing orders for about a thousand extra gigawatts of solar energy (over what the market would generate on its own), and 100-200 extra gw of wind energy, as soon as possible, at an investment cost of usd 1 to 1.5 trillion, spread over ten years or so.
without it, we can’t survive.
invisible hand will turn right controls in right moment.
finally feedstock grown in a marine environment also forms a special case where iluc considerations are irrelevant.
tens of millions of low-heat fires are notorious soot and co2 generation “pinpoint” sources, which when aggregated likely contribute many hundreds of megatons of co2 to the atmosphere.
nobody is perfect, and even pioneers sometimes make faulty decisions.
one cannot change the energy system alone.
most transmission and distribution lines in use today were built many decades ago, in the age of big coal and nuclear power plants, and are simply not designed to cope with the increasing amount of renewable energy fed into the grid from dispersed sources, including micro-generation.
the better news comes from the growing efforts being made at the local, regional or enterprise level to cut emissions and to favour low-carbon development.
also, the shift to better renewable energy practices would help cut the negative financial effects of carbon emissions, such as healthcare costs.

we might end up with the technology available, the policy in place, but without the investments to get there.
scheduling and resource allocation in distributed systems play a major role in finding the best task–resource matches in time and space based on a given objective function without violating a given set of constraints.
these subsidies were brought in for a variety of reasons (largely political though), and range from populist subsidies on highly visible fuel and power products (such as those on gasoline in libya and venezuela) to the more covert subsidies which are often in the form of import tariffs (e.g. on imported bio-fuel to the u.s.).
in sum, the inept conduct of the international community certainly does not constitute “good [global] climate governance”, however one defines the term.
some, such as energy corporations, are not particularly helpful.
so now there are no resources to fund anything.
but we can’t get caught up in just growing high value strains.
in the us, we just finished grueling elections that brought back some pretty extreme views, including denial that climate change is a factual reality.
best regards nam raj you cannot pick up a paper or listen to the radio or watch tv without experiencing a story about carbon emissions, or sustainability.
the co2 is consumed to cultivate algae in a pump-less flowing circuit, which will produce more than xxx,xxx gallons of algae oil per acre per year for biofuels.
the distance that the feedstock must be transported has a high impact on net ghg emission avoidance.
the government has not engaged its citizens in a dialogue, i.e. has fallen short of adhering to the tenets of transparency and public participation.
vision can provide others with the conviction that their actions and ideas are not in vain, but that individual actions contributes to changes on a larger scale.
second, we need to rethink how we consume goods and services and change the designs and delivery accordingly.
the gradual removal of favoured treatment would help form a more balanced system; one that relays the actual prices of energy to the consumer.
others, such as ngos, do their best but obviously have little direct influence on the emission of ghg.
the actual increase in rainfall in any one localized area near deployment of these machines will indicate increased rainfall eventually everywhere.
as the “wet” air mass in the atmosphere increases, eventually this extra fresh water vapor in the atmosphere will logically increase rainfall globally, including back onto the ocean itself.
in cancún, later this year, the world’s governments will return to their annual climate summit completely stymied on even the smallest cuts in greenhouse emissions.
as floods and wildfires have shown pakistanis and russians this summer, a few extreme events can visit ruinous setbacks on economies.
what is actually in the cistern is limewater, an automated method for sensing & replenishment of the lime and water, a drain and a bottom-cleaning device similar to that used in a swimming pool.
but, another spot on the sun of the market is frequently puffing and bursting bubbles… of course, market economy apologists have an answer – these are only some imperfections of the market (market failures); let’s apply adjustments (co2 taxes, emission trading schemes, etc.) to the market mechanisms, and all things will rearrange in good order.
until the population is able to vote for the right kind of politician, it just won’t get done.
three examples will suffice: first, subsidies to fossil fuels run at over $500 billion per year – a sum that, if directed at the low-carbon transition, might take us a long way towards a carbon-neutral society.
for point of use production at an existing larger facility just install our solar collector portion of the system in a circuit immediately within the perimeter fence of airports, logistics depots, military bases & the like.
even if could design a carbon neutral society from scratch now, there will be future technological and social surprises that will affect its functioning.
this would mean taking carbon out of the power sector by replacing fossil fuels with renewable energies such as wind.
then, using that, one can properly communicate, and understand better the public concern.
each different species of plant will then consume contaminants (trace nutrients) directly from the environment.
substituting wind and solar for coal and natural gas in providing baseload power is not going to happen because they are intermittent and isolated from the grid.
the fact the human race is causing an increase should be of no great surprise.
share: for almost twenty years, as the science became progressively more precise and frightening, we have assumed that the only way to get to a low-carbon – and ideally a carbon neutral – society was to reach a global agreement whereby the world’s nations would agree to act on the basis of clear targets, with the burden shared out on an equitable basis among them and a functioning carbon market that would seek the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions.
the international energy agency predicts in its latest world energy outlook that natural gas will play a “central role in meeting the world’s energy needs for at least the next two-and-a-half decades.”
again, this spectacle involved fund managers investing and trading for people who, given a say, might well have chosen to factor climate change into the decisions taken.

enel, the italian energy giant, had floated its renewables arm at the same time as coal india, but its ipo was a flop.
these have to do with the policy frameworks in place and that give encouragement to industry and to the consumer to prefer carbon-based production and consumption over the alternatives.
more humans, having ever more offspring, means more houses, more cars, more food, more ipods, more iphones, more xboxes, more dogs, more cats, with each house or dwelling requiring more power, which requires more infrastructure for power distribution, more streets, more sewer systems, more water treatment plant capacity, etc.
the plandevelpde here includes a new renewable electricity generation and transmission infrastructure with 155 large wind turbines, half a square kilometre of rooftop solar panels, and a biomass plant burning coconut husks.
for example, a carbon neutral energy system does not provide a carbon neutral society without changes in our food or natural resource systems; carbon neutral countries cannot balance out carbon producing countries; a carbon neutral society for 6 billion people does not necessarily sustain a carbon neutral society of 9 billion people.
we should stop rating countries based on physical and economic development for example “nepal is one of the poor countries…” rather we should start saying “nepal is one of the environmentally rich countries…” we need to develop some kind of world governance that will be able to tax for more carbon emission and reward for less.
this last election–a catastrophe for the climate and many other concerns–saw oceans of secret contributions going into the campaigns of the tea party candidates, all of whom, as far as i can tell, are scientifically illiterate, many proudly so.
once individuals, businesses and politicians see it as in their best interest, we’ll be on the road.
for example, if a government changes its legislation to favour investment in renewables, those invested in traditional energy can argue that this represents indirect expropriation of their own investment and seek compensation.

meaningful carbon sequestration without economic devastation but improvement.
as nations begin to gather for yet another round of international climate change regulatory discussions, it is clear that countries, regions, and companies are not waiting for a binding and global regulatory framework for climate change.
to one extent or another, these countries’ climate policies consist of the following: a long-term and consistent climate policy with clear and measurable ghg reduction targets, based on scientific data (“evidence-based policy”), employing diverse policy tools aimed at generating more efficient energy markets and increasing the share of renewable energy resources, and periodic review and reassessment.

the current crisis does not help, and carbon leakage effects make the situation even worse.
and with the state of western government finances as they are, i suppose penalties are more likely to happen than subsidies.
when we price the environment into our accounting systems, polluting activities gain an economic burden, giving a true cost to their impacts.
given the current economic atmosphere, the most promising way to push for such a transition is to make a strong economic and jobs argument for transitioning to carbon neutrality.
and claims are made that there is a cost saving in transmission – true; but when you put numbers to it, the added cost of distributed pv paid for by the ratepayers far exceeds the cost of added transmission.
backup power has to be available and that tends to be again, coal or possibly nuclear.
we need to bring carbon dioxide levels below 350 ppm from their current level of about 387 ppm.
in the summer months that rejected heat adds to the cooling load for air conditioned space.
although distributed systems (clusters, supercomputers, grids, data centres and clouds) provide an unparalleled level of computational horsepower for solving challenging problems across a wide spectrum of fields—from scientific inquiry, engineering design, and financial analysis to national defence and disaster prediction—such horsepower usually equals enormous power consumption, not only to run the distributed system but also to cool it.
but those people are mostly allowed no say in where their pension funds, insurance premiums, and banking deposits are invested.
solar power is another avenue.
too many of us, including individuals, governments and businesses, do not pay to emit ghgs.
the biggest danger is that we wait for one of the other hats (business, government, consumers) to take action.
this means the end of cap and trade policies that shuffle money and blame around by shifting energy intensive manufacturing processes to other parts of the world.
in a balanced system, when demand rises for a particular stock then the price should also rise, which would normally push down demand.
our first-generation carbon neutral buildings will carry great social significance while being inherently beautiful.
we should take on board the fact that the us and china are currently moving faster in many respects than the eu and that far from leading the green revolution, we are in danger of playing catch-up and losing jobs and competitiveness to other parts of the world.
once a lobbying group has formed, they will often persuade the ruling party to introduce compounding regulations that create high barriers to entry for competing resources (victor, 2009).
the reason we instituted taxes for these items was because the people who do not drink or smoke – the healthy ones – end up indirectly paying the medical bills for the people who do and get sick.

enormous quantities of refrigerant escape to the atmosphere from leaks and junking wrecks and retired vehicles.
the current reaction of many is that taxes are applied to undesirable activities such as motoring but these are diverted or squandered but no viable alternatives are offered e.g. the lamentable option of public transport in london and the south east.
in addition to system homogeneity, tasks are often homogeneous or independent.
sa provides evidence to decision-makers, generates individual and organizational learning, avoids costly mistakes and provides a forum for deliberation and participation.
but, this is a sticking plaster for old technology not a forward-looking solution; it is also costly and inefficient and therefore unlikely to lead to the widespread adoption of ccs.
setting the stage metaphorically, from simple classic physics/mechanics, we know the simple answer to this type of problem.
yes, we need to clean up and sequester carbon from fossil-fuel-fired electrical generation facilities, and to revisit the desirability of both large and small nuclear plants.
u.s. wind energy market grew 78% in 2008, adding 17.3 megawatts of new wind energy capacity, and selling about half of all small wind turbines installed globally then.(2) china is rapidly accelerating wind energy development, promising 100 gigawatts of capacity by 2020, about a quarter of current total u.s. energy demand.(3)
the specific plants are chosen based upon what contaminants are in and around the lake water cross-referenced by the species that have rapidity of growth as well as requiring uptake of trace elements matching as many entries on the list of contaminants as possible.
people accept way more changes, when they understand the problems and the solutions.
in the energy sector, this means providing answers with regard to e.g. smart electricity grids, the future of fossils fuels, the reality and the perception of nuclear energy risks, long-term emission reduction goals and international energy cooperation.
i am here to show by doing that it can be done.
reduction in a minimum of 20% dependancy on the grid is guaranteed with the current available technology.
this competition is an opportunity to develop a world leading template that will be rolled out across the globe.
charismatic leadership can provide certainty in times when actions are not immediately paying off and patience is required.
as long as geothermal heat (on a small scale) can be tapped onsite, the latitude limits for algae cultivation on a year-round basis theoretically stretch nearly to the entire earth between the arctic and antarctic circles until photo-period simply won’t support growth rates to be economically feasible.
he recognized that an effective business model requires a disruptive whole-system approach that provides profit but also could be marketed as a premium product.
indeed the fact that there are so many interested parties involved in the energy sector makes simply understanding the underlying plethora of self-interests quite a task.
to capture 100% of the particulates drawn in by the vacuum pump as the intake air is neither pre-filtered nor is it dry-filtered, it is by using water filtration (rising bubbles) the particulates in the air end up remaining suspended in the lime water.

money keeps on going to the same silly projects, like enhanced oil recovery (eor) in depleted reservoirs in the guise of “sequestration” to store co2 emissions.
such a hybrid power system would get wind and solar widely deployed by making co2 into a resource.
energy–aware scheduling is a software based power saving approach which has great potential due to its inherent adaptability, cost–effectiveness and applicability.
it would take a brave leader to risk their own popularity by implementing the widely unpopular decisions needed to fully decarbonise.
the call for greater energy efficiency, reduced oil imports, and more livable cities is already significantly reducing carbon emissions per unit of gdp.
too many times, the approach to non-fossil energy has been driven by business interests which don’t always tell the whole truth without adequate consideration for what makes good public policy.
the greatest barrier is people’s lack of access to a transparent and cogent master plan.
this means that when the die-off of the algae overgrowth that would then recycle those nutrients back into the water, those nutrients are instead taken up with the mats.
nations are not the only players in the global climate game.
these market mechanisms are very strong and reinforced by feedbacks, embodied in the principles of liberal economic policies.
this means setting targets alone is by far not sufficient.
other problems caused by nox and particulate matter include premature death, increased emergency room visits with respiratory symptoms and disease, damaged farm crops, acid rain and impairment of vision.
i mentioned that i just returned from a western caribbean cruise.
this would presumably enable each nation to make rational-choice decisions about their positions in upcoming cop negotiations.
it is a tall order, but 100 million clean stoves would reduce co2 emissions by 100 to 400 million tons a year.
consider, right along with lost carbon sequestration from global deforestation, the huge related contribution to atmospheric co2 each day from slash-and-burn land clearing and the woody-mass-fueled cook fires used by three billion people in the developing world.
the desertec activity in north africa is very intriguing for the european electric grid.
finally, even though there are endless opportunities for investors in clean energy – especially in the developing world – too many things (in addition to subsidies and investment rules) combine to scare the investor off.
america is on the right track, but must accelerate the pace of evolution toward a carbon neutral, clean energy society, for the sake of the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and the preservation of our natural resources.
i predict it will probably win out as the “800 pound gorilla” in the long run as we settle on a specific implementation and the learning curve kicks in; though i don’t rule out pv being a major player (once the initial investment is written off by bankruptcies as happened with fiber optics) and if storage technology matures.
recycled wood is considered a renewable energy source, until it’s not.
citizens empowerment will be crucial as the recent high-level workshop “living in a low-carbon society” attended by the commissioner demonstrated.
enel, the italian energy giant, had floated its renewables arm at the same time as coal india, but its ipo was a flop.
in fact, the iea says, natural gas is the only fossil fuel for which demand is higher in 2035 than it was in 2008.
psychology, maybe together with some alternative economics, wrapped in philosophy and epistemology, and not at all natural or engineering sciences alone, may be holding some answers for us in the quest to find a practical way to “really speed up the transition to a carbon neutral society”.
it is not free for an industrial company to pollute rivers, and so it follows thatit should not be free to pollute the air.
as a change management specialist, i will develop the second part.
a consistent global carbon price (either through a tax or a cap & trade system).
biomass is still a hydrocarbon and burning it produces co2.
further to this is the effect of societal influence (i.e. disruptive technologies generally tend to progress downwards through societal classes, and not upwards (fisk, 2008)).
we have created a model of a virtual building, measured its performance at every step, and managed team members’ expectations until we designed a real building that works.
this is an essential complimentary function, as realizing the transition will require the implementation of tangible initiatives – say projects.
let me go on: the business interests pushing pv and wind have ignored storage for as long as they could.
while demand for energy surges, driven by economic transition, all fuel types will be in demand, from liquid fuel, to coal, natural gas, nuclear and renewable energy.
the former can be broken down into transportation, heating, and electricity.
in colorado, we have a mandate for distributed pv which is totally out of whack with central power generation costs.
sa is then seen as a stakeholder-driven process in search of sustainable energy futures.
the financial benefits alone should push us toward such reforms.
one cannot change the energy system alone.
the rise of a ‘green economy’ is supposed to make the ‘carbon-neutral society’ happen, as it takes the links between economy, society and the environment into account and aims to boost and diversify our society, create employment opportunities, improve equity and foster sustainability.
suvs could get 67 mpg if built with current hybrid technology and new advanced ultralight materials (eg, carbon fiber thermoplastic composites), according to energy expert amory lovins.
instead of using hydro power to meet our demands, we have explored the seas just to derive fossil fuels from them.
their case is instructive insofar as their climate policies exemplify the meaning and importance of “good governance”–to my mind the main stepping stone on the road to a carbon-neutral society.
recent data disclose the astonishing likelihood that, far from serving as an invaluable carbon sink, these decaying trees and deadfall will cause massive carbon-positive releases exactly coinciding with the decades during which we hope to best the climate-forcing challenge.
but let me suppose that these adjusting mechanisms are geared too late and are too impotent to make corrections in a meaningful time.
the price for carbon emissions could go up as high as it wants; in the end all companies can do is close their doors when the much needed technology is not available.
this in essence is the default licence that governments and regulators have handed to the financial-services sector.
the quality of output schedule is determined using an appropriate objective function that takes into account energy consumption in addition to other conventional metrics, such as, task completion times and load balance, high throughput and high availability [4].
subsequently, favorable factor projections for different worldviews are combined into scenario skeletons, which are then elaborated into scenarios based on back-casting methodology.
it also means the end of policies that promote energy production based on its type and not on its actual resource footprint.
furthermore, the holistic approach of sa ensures that key sustainability topics (ranging from biodiversity conservation to poverty eradication) are not ‘lost’ in an overly narrow focus on carbon emissions alone.
we must all understand that, by continuing to do so we are causing more damage than good to ourselfs.
deutsche bank, working with the un secretary-general’s advisory group on energy and climate change, has already through the details of the investment scheme that would be necessary, including the insurance and risk management, in their “get fit” program (“global energy transfer feed-in tariffs for developing countries”), published in april of 2010.
it would push our leaders towards redefining national socio-economic health in terms of sustainability rather than growth, an important imperative for all nations.
share: new challenges such as global environmental and climatic change, the dwindling availability of ecosystem services, the increased demand for natural resources and geo-political power shifts demand innovative solutions.
because to change a culture, one has to change its agreements, and create new ones, then start to change behaviors, then make these new behaviors into a habit for some.
in the largest ever initial public offering on the indian stock exchange, coal india, a huge government-owned coal company, recently offered 10% of its shares to investors at home and abroad.
it is clear that changes needed will not come without new, creative, out-of-the-box solutions.
annual energy cost savings through energy efficiency and solar power is be $185,000 for an average office building the payback for the investment to reach carbon neutrality compared to our baseline building would be 12 years if the rise in fuel costs outpaces general inflation by 4 percent a year.
also, note that first mover advantages (such as brand recognitions, creation of market positions, technology lead, creation of patent barriers) create a favorable position in the green innovation race balancing risk and opportunities associated with investments.
landfill gas relies upon more garbage being put into landfills to decay into landfill gas.
they should be concentrated where ocean currents are strongest and we allow the currents to distribute the oxygenated seawater for us where possible.
see http://network.carboncapturejournal.com/forum/topics/sequestration-time-to-punt sharpening the axe should begin with frank technology assessment, which should not cost much.
efficiency has to be greatly improved and industries’ strengths combined, etc.
those ending up owning stock include 484 foreign funds, 195 mutual funds, 44 insurance companies, and many banks.
sa provides evidence to decision-makers, generates individual and organizational learning, avoids costly mistakes and provides a forum for deliberation and participation.
the media is also highly problematic – so long as witless media outlets like fox news continue to brainwash the easily influenced into thinking that climate change is “debatable,” then nothing will happen.
the next important aspect to address is energy infrastructure.
ultimately this leads to an identification of energy scenario preferences that will embody the societal transition.
finally, for more great news about detroit and michigan, stay tuned; i will get back to you very soon!share: tags: energy, environment, progress towards sustainability click here to cancel reply.
while critics believe global warming is a hoax, anyone with their eyes open can see the polar caps shrinking, glaciers melting on a world wide basis, and droughts being reported across the globe, including the amazon basin.
a market isn’t something bad in its essence, but, like as most of things, it has the other side of the shield.
you are part of the solution – the sum of the incremental actions of all citizens can have a significant effect both through political influence and energy efficient behavior.
as nations begin to gather for yet another round of international climate change regulatory discussions, it is clear that countries, regions, and companies are not waiting for a binding and global regulatory framework for climate change.
this might seem radical, but given the long life of power plants it would be a necessary step if the eu really intends to honour its commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050.
it is also about historic transformation of the eu institutions relationship with their citizens and politicians.
considering the distributed deployment of the equipment, that could take a while.
the weather is more pleasant than in copenhagen and the beaches are nice, but the chances of progress toward a new climate protocol are slim.
to drive and speed up business change, we need a globally agreed framework for pricing carbon.
during a transition period it will be necessary to provide incentives compensating early adaptors for various inconveniences when using new fuels or energy carriers.
for the sake of brevity i’m going to describe the system using common objects for analogy based on the physical dynamics employed.
science always support for carbon neutrality and present ecosystem, let’s make use of it.
it provides a common sense transitional solution if we are really serious about reducing carbon emissions urgently.
every time there is a lead news story that’s connected to energy the energy discussion comes to a crescendo and then fades into the background as business as usual proceeds.
inconsistency in governments – they can’t make up their mind what the regulations are.
essentailly it is a concerted action by the private sector, regulatory bodies , governemnt tax breaks that can go a long way in speeding up the transition.
climate change is a global phenomenon; it is only natural to respond internationally.
making sustainable behavior more mainstream by benchmarking it.
whether it’s climate change, peak oil, energy security, keeping the billions we spend on oil at home to grow our own economy, or competing with the likes of china for leadership in new industries, such as wind and solar, everyone can find a reason to move to a carbon neutral society.
while a lofty goal, striving towards carbon neutrality will further enable the great energy revolution, of which we are in the early stages.
governments, on a domestic and international scale, have the power to incentivise or restrict both individuals and industry.
then, we will be faced with real choices in every aspect of our lives with genuine, cost effective alternatives to carbon costly activities.
while i am optimistic that there is growing support for each of these proposed directions, we can only hope that the current slow recovery from the recession does not create significant delay.
the “big push” would help renewable, carbon-free energy get over the hump of initial investment costs, after which the market would kick into overdrive, as it did for computer chips.
we don‟t have a proper global agreement to the greenhouse gas emissions.
prices for rooftop solar systems fall as supply grows.
of course, unconventional oil is expensive to extract.
by deploying large numbers (tbd) of this floating apparatus as a test by for example; dotting the mississippi river estuary, even miles out to sea the effects on the gulf of mexico’s eutrophic estuarial dead zones will be significant and immediate.
the components are: energy efficiency – achieve significant savings in energy use through more efficient appliances, home modifications (such as weatherization upgrades), and commercial, industrial, and manufacturing practices.
this, in turn, results in extremely large electricity bills and reduced system reliability [1].
this could help reduce demand for wanton and wasteful energy services, leaving behind only the truly competitive products.
it is clear that changes needed will not come without new, creative, out-of-the-box solutions.
many of these investors were using ordinary citizens’ money, and this would have included the nest eggs of people worried about global warming and its dire impact on the world by the time they retire.
the political risk is too high.
i have no reason yet to believe implementing these technologies on a global scale would (if handled properly) have any deleterious effects on the environment.
yet coal india’s prospectus, crafted with the help of a clutch of big-name investment banks, did not mention climate change once in 510 pages of exhortation to invest.
we might end up with the technology available, the policy in place, but without the investments to get there.
a second objection is that organic farming methods would require us to have far more farmers to feed the world.
it also shows how important cities are, and will be, in the energy use and greenhouse gas emissions of the world:http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/wopj.2011.27.4.11.
even as the u.s. and canada tut-tut burning the stuff, they are busy exporting it in ever-greater amounts to so-called developing economies.
on an international scale a change in our economic accounting of natural resources would fundamentally change our approach to them.
first, sa can be used as a foresight tool; as a guide to energy transitions.
it is the local level where much of the real climate action happens right now.
these two aspects must balance to not stay at the research level : you may have the best solution, technologically proven, but they will never ever be implemented without public consent.
the more direct approach would be to recognise that most of us naturally resist giving up things we believe we already possess rather than speculate on gains that may turn out not to be realistic.
social scientists will tell you that the grounds for a negotiated climate deal are shaky.
no national economy can remain competitive and viable without developing them, producing or purchasing them and using them–in short, breaking the path to a carbon-neutral society.
secondly, sa can also be a practical tool to assess concrete projects (e.g. energy projects).
share: i strongly believe that there are many opportunities for more sustainable technologies across many fields and disciplines.
available direct or indirect solar power will meet all energy demands.
nevertheless, attaining a carbon moderate society takes a lot of time.
so my bottom line is that we not press for more and more non-fossil energy resources, but we try to look not only at those that can achieve 20 to 30% but 80% as is the issue with the electric grid.
our living systems are just not prepared for the huge changes required to move to a carbon neutral society.
the international energy agency predicts in its latest world energy outlook that natural gas will play a “central role in meeting the world’s energy needs for at least the next two-and-a-half decades.”
i was born in 1953, and, with the planet’s population then at roughly three billion human inhabitants, we imposed significantly less burden on the earth’s resources.
they are also permitted – as the coal india ipo shows – to gamble with the global climate in the course of their routine advisory business, bringing coal to the markets by the gigatonne, without the requirement for a single item of liability accounting on the global balance sheet.
using first of the 6 cornerstones, algae production to consume the co2 regardless of algae production in excess of the global energy demand will greatly accelerate carbon sequestration.
we quickly discovered that placing trees in the wrong places would impede the day lighting solution.
using these fuels in the way we currently do has serious consequences and for that reason we have to find a new way to use them cleanly and responsibly.
this is encouraging and it is a high priority to identify the successes, work out how they can be replicated and, where possible, significantly scaled up.
especially with the total product(ion) life cycle in mind, it sounds as realistic as stating the current online music industry is carbon neutral.
they say a government-imposed price on carbon emissionswould unfairly causelower income citizens to spend proportionately more of their money on utilities and products that will incur this tax or carbon pricethan theirmore well-to-do contemporaries.
nine geos themes the geos investment process leverages climate change mitigation and adaptation opportunities across nine environmental themes: -agricultural productivity and clean fuels: improve agricultural yields; non-carbon fuel sources -clean technology and efficiency: environmental conservation methods; limit waste during power generation -efficient transport: enable greater efficiencies for transport -environmental finance: carbon trading infrastructure and financing -power merchants and generation: power sources and services with low greenhouse gas (ghg)
the basic of this are: generating energy is much more expensive than conserving it.
in fact it’s not a recent phenomenon; the romans deforested most of europe long before columbus discovered america changing european climate.
this fear is causing so much negative inertia that no one is gaining anything in a situation where the implementation could make a huge difference in a global economic recovery.
the study also indicates that this electricity consumption in that year had doubled compared with consumption in 2000
it is not enough to simply minimize the total energy usage in the cloud; instead one needs to simultaneously minimize energy usage between all the different providers in the clouds.
more than 200 billion metric tons of co2-equivalent reductions of fluorocarbon emissions (hfcs, hcfcs) have already taken place under the montreal protocol, an accomplishment greater than the entire (unachieved) first commitment period under the kyoto protocol.
when eventually appropriate in however many years, simply recycle the excess equipment from the processes no longer needed for environmental clean up but for maintenance.
that means producing rated power about 30% of the time.
while i believe that the world should be moving to a sustainable energy base, i think we need to worry about the technical and economic realities of this conversion and not to act in a frenzied way to get there.
but if this is not managed thoroughly and driven with the adequate push, there will be no appropriation, no participation, instead there will be resistance to change, criticism, etc.
share: my answer: transparency and cooperation: for example: both north africa and the eu stand to gain tremendous value if there is some way we can get all of the potential countries, equipment vendors, constructors, raw energy providers to recognize that there is room for a world changing win for everyone if we can work together to orchestrate proper integration and balancing of the resources and by products.
clearly, there are environmental issues with the generation of electricity.
at the same time, investment bankers will be back in their casinos with barely a light slap on their wrists after nearly plunging the world into depression in 2008.
the bigger challenge will be convincing china and india that coal is uncouth.
our energy and environment futures will be very complex and are related to our economic, health, and human security futures.
this will not only meet the daily needs of consumers, but will eradicate the burden of trailers/trucks used to transport commodities between cities and countries.
the number of u.s. solar panel roof systems is exploding as the price plummets 60% or more with new tax incentives.(1) plastic solar cells, organic solar concentrators and rapidly evolving solar thermal technology are rapidly making solar energy costs competitive with fossil fuels.
see http://network.carboncapturejournal.com/forum/topics/sequestration-time-to-punt sharpening the axe should begin with frank technology assessment, which should not cost much.
but we will never achieve a carbon-neutral society unless we push very hard on other strategies that have nothing to do with electrical generation, industrial ghg emissions quotas or, for that matter, even co2 emissions themselves.
the idea is that the adequate integration of sustainability principles in decisions made at various levels (from local to sub-national to (inter)national level) will contribute to the achievement of a carbon-neutral society.
final comments above presented ideas concerning incentive schemes and tax on fuels or energy carriers, are completely focussed on (a) favouring fuel efficiency and reduction of ghg emissions, also (b) ensuring that renewable energy can successfully compete with energy based on the use of fossil resources.
they involve things like zero-carbon homes, electric cars used as mobile energy storage plants, smart grids to optimise power use, and green bonds for financing the whole thing.
converging catalysts create opportunity there are multiple and converging catalysts at work that are enabling this energy revolution to power global economies more efficiently.
as recent events once again demonstrate, the german public does not particularly like nuclear energy, especially the shipping of nuclear waste.
this is only human nature.
we all know for a fact that two-third of the earth’s surface is covered with water.
each cabin included furniture, cabinetry, and various materials, including wood, plastics, and metal.
it requires policies and social marketing that target behavioral changes in industry and business and also consumers, since in the end it is us as consumers, citizens, and shareholders who will direct the trsansition.
but yes, a strategy is available – converting this biomass to syngas, bio-oil and biochar via pyrolysis – an extraordinary public works project, but necessary, it appear, to get ahead of this problem.
the success of many cities in reducing ghg emissions demonstrates that effective climate change policy is possible at the urban level as well.
3 stern estimates the costs of mitigation and adaptation at two percent of global gnp.
the quantity of co2 released may reach several hundred megatons, not of co2, but of carbon, offsetting and perhaps cancelling all the carbon management measures i mentioned in the beginning.
of course the stock response is energy storage.
since innovation tends to favour the funded i.e. the well off can buy new, efficient stuff while the poor are stuck with old tech, care is required to ensure that viable options are developed for everyone.
in fact it’s not a recent phenomenon; the romans deforested most of europe long before columbus discovered america changing european climate.
we used, and relied on, dramatically less resources.
at the very least, this has a significant “chill effect” on potential investors in clean energy.
it is the local level where much of the real climate action happens right now.
the price for carbon emissions could go up as high as it wants; in the end all companies can do is close their doors when the much needed technology is not available.
the offering was oversubscribed 15 fold, and the stock soared on the first day of trading, 4 november, valuing coal india at $49bn.
here are some examples: leed certified buildings will reduce our energy consumption.
that means delivering a vision of a healthy, stable society that people can buy into.
but in the panic over global warming, post-combustion chemical co2 capture and underground co2 dumping (“sequestration”), biofuels, windmills, and solar — none of which are workable at utility scale for providing the baseload power the world needs — were rushed forward and absorbed all of the available money.
we need policy and regulatory certainty over time and a reasonable price on emissions so that companies, governments and individuals can make the right decisions when we buy energy and products and services.
in china, lung cancer caused by air pollution is now the leading cause of death in urban areas.
pursuing such a strategy would help the world decarbonize much more quickly, because it would accelerate the drop in price for renewables dramatically, using the enormous scales of the market for energy in developing countries — who urgently need clean, affordable energy services most.
only then will they be ready to throw sufficient human and material resources as quickly as possible into its solution, stopping carbon emissions.
the usual suspects of solutions are just way too simple to apply to everywhere and to all people.
this means setting targets alone is by far not sufficient.
the quality of output schedule is determined using an appropriate objective function that takes into account energy consumption in addition to other conventional metrics, such as, task completion times and load balance, high throughput and high availability [4].
adjacent to an example coal fired power plant we build algae cultivation capacity capable of sustaining the energy needs of the local community plus the difference between that, and the amount of co2 needed to produce the algae annually to fuel a more flexible combined-cycle gas/steam turbine power system.
tens of millions of low-heat fires are notorious soot and co2 generation “pinpoint” sources, which when aggregated likely contribute many hundreds of megatons of co2 to the atmosphere.
if the whole lifecycle cost of a product could be explained to us in terms of sustainability, we might start to change our behavior and expectations, and business might respond to that.
sa is then an iterative, long-term, pro-active and explorative framework generating knowledge to feed the societal debate on how to tackle major challenges in a sustainable way.
the u.s. could save almost $1 trillion over the next decade (2008 mckinsey global institute report.)
our team found out that designing for carbon neutrality demands integrated, unflinching design and analysis, and that nothing is too important to be questioned or changed.
the design of such protocols for cloud systems is further complicated by the fact that the different sites in a cloud system are likely to have different capabilities.
germany, which has already succeeded in decoupling economic growth from fossil energy use and national ghg emissions, is about to extend the phase-out period of its nuclear reactors, paradoxically to achieve the ambitious ghg reduction targets it has set for itself.
not if you already know that non-co2 emissions, primarily methane, hydrofluorocarbons, smog-causing ozone and dark soot particles, cause just under half of all climate-forcing, which means that the strategies we discuss the most address only about half the problem.
a classic example of a distortion resulting from this type of approach is of north american woodchips being burned in europe to generate “carbon-neutral” electricity.
that means delivering a vision of a healthy, stable society that people can buy into.
clean electricity at source feeds downstream, negating the urgent need for significant changes in consumption and infrastructure.
yet the huge soot and co2 emissions from open fires of all sorts globally go almost unaddressed.
energy efficiency is the place to begin.
nobody wants to admit a mistake and change direction, especially when the funding apparatus is supervised by those invested in the mistake.
while i am optimistic that there is growing support for each of these proposed directions, we can only hope that the current slow recovery from the recession does not create significant delay.
by that time, contamination levels should have decreased to allow more & different plants to be grown as feed-stocks for other industries (cellulosic ethanol) offsetting the systems cost substantially.
however, if one were to bring this simple process argument in front of seasoned famed economists, s/he may be chased out of the room with a vengeance.
wind power makes strides in china.
second, we need to rethink how we consume goods and services and change the designs and delivery accordingly.
older model heavy-duty diesel engine trucks and buses release unburned hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide (co), sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides (nox), particulate matter, and other toxic compounds.
it’s widely acknowledged that with a republican majority, there’s no chance for energy and climate change legislation.
it is thus essential to ensure that the criteria chosen are vetted very carefully, that the results are tied to state-of-the-art technolgy, and that they are also reflecting changes over time concerning exploration and extraction efficiencies for various fossil resources.
for pharmaceutical use these oils sell (as of this writing) for $200+ per gallon.
we may achieve these aims, but not in the short-term, and we may only have the short-term – or at most the medium-term – available to us if we are to act on reducing atmospheric carbon in time to avoid catastrophic and irreversible climate change.
as the bubbles rise, the air within exchanges some trace gasses with the seawater and will also become saturated with water vapor to 100% rh.
well-to-wheels, or cradle-to-grave, ghg efficiency studies performed are inevitably influenced by the vested interests among the people engaged in the study.
china is a good example.
methane, a valuable fuel and main constituent of natural gas, has a gwp of 25 and is released from landfills, livestock, coal mines, rice paddies and leaky gas pipelines.
the simplest solution of this problem would probably be to apply the same fuel tax as for the corresponding fossil fuel, but at the same time pay the producer a subsidy based on the actually assessed ghg emission reduction per unit of fuel produced at his particular plant.
that means long term sustainability with reduced consumption of materials, and to some extent energy.
tomorrow might perhaps be different and better, given the growth rates of renewables industries, notwithstanding the languishing share prices of many renewables companies.
some, such as energy corporations, are not particularly helpful.
as floods and wildfires have shown pakistanis and russians this summer, a few extreme events can visit ruinous setbacks on economies.
landfill gas is a renewable energy.
feedstock • long term substitution of coal as a source for transportation fuels and chemical industry feedstock • possibilities to avoid ghg emissions from the use of fossil fuels • possibilities to provide a foolproof solution concerning nuclear waste • development of the large potentials for renewable electric power care should not erode the availability of fuels for mobile applications • utilizing waste and other biomass resources in an optimal manner, maximizing net fuel output per tonne of waste, or per hectare of land •
sa also embodies the democratic values of sustainability, as it needs to be conducted in a participatory way.
but higher energy prices, due to a carbon tax and/or higher use of costly renewable energy, mean lower economic growth and lower job creation.
currency will be crucial.
considering the need to household with renewable biofuel feedstock we should avoid using available biomass for other purposes than biofuel production or chemical industry feedstock.
ultimately this leads to an identification of energy scenario preferences that will embody the societal transition.
going back to the source of how we produce our electricity in the first place is the only way in which change can occur.
and to recognize that the added co2 from these sources, until we can technically and economically sequester the co2, will be offset by the need for the world to deploy geoengineering such as solar radiation management – with or without ctl/gtl should climate change prove to be sooner and greater than the most likely values.
i get bothered about using energy to make energy, as conversions are never 100% efficient.
but somehow, the entire value chain still needs to be fed, be it in people, fuel, energy, primaries… it would thus be more realistic to reflect upon on a carbon moderate society.
as a society we have understood that each of these “vices” inevitably lead to real costs to our country – they are a negative externality – and we have to account for these costs.
for within the water itself we install algal mats which promote rapid algae growth with the property that the algae from the water will tend to stick to the mats to be removed from the lake with the mat.
in the energy sector, this means providing answers with regard to e.g. smart electricity grids, the future of fossils fuels, the reality and the perception of nuclear energy risks, long-term emission reduction goals and international energy cooperation.
by having a plentiful supply of food, it’s the one common thread that keeps the human race civilized without becoming a pack of animals reverting back to our primal primitive instincts.
there is also a lack of any clear model for what can integrate into the legacy system that will not cost jobs or reliability.
as i write these lines, delegates around the world are packing their suitcases to attend the cop16 meeting in cancun.
the fact that we emit co2 naturally by breathing, along with the entire animal world, doesn’t make the “right” for humans to industrially emit so much more in orders of magnitude co2 that it dwarfs any planetary natural capacity of compensation either a “nature endorsed” possibility or a natural right.
thus, reaching global carbon-neutrality also involves replacing open cook fires with the simple, efficient biomass-burning cook stoves available today.
it is a tall order, but 100 million clean stoves would reduce co2 emissions by 100 to 400 million tons a year.
even as the u.s. and canada tut-tut burning the stuff, they are busy exporting it in ever-greater amounts to so-called developing economies.
in conclusion, sustainability assessment can be a powerful process that allows decision-makers to structure complex ‘hot societal topics’ in a systematic way, based on scientific input and on participation.
the added funding of renewable energy research would also create much-needed us jobs in the newly emerging “green” sector.
barriers (especially the not seen or not so easily traceable ones) to our very ability to address fully the issue may be higher than we imagine.
what is requierd is vision and will to do so.
on the same day coal india shares started trading so too did enel green power’s.
please imagine, a high volume pv solar powered vacuum pump connected to what is in essence sealed room with an inlet pipe dropping into a cistern creating in effect, an enormous solar powered hooka.
the indulgences issued by the catholic church did not stop sin, and “carbon offsets” will not reduce co2 emissions.
clearly, there are environmental issues with the generation of electricity.
cities must now make themselves part of the natural cycle by recycling their organic wastes back into the soil.
smog-causing ozone and soot emissions are already stringently regulated, but emissions can be reduced further (with enormous co-benefits for health, food crops and property) with broader, stricter controls.
policy makers need to articulate and create the need for urgency to change amongst consumers; also that a different way of life does not mean a worst way of life.
germany, which has already succeeded in decoupling economic growth from fossil energy use and national ghg emissions, is about to extend the phase-out period of its nuclear reactors, paradoxically to achieve the ambitious ghg reduction targets it has set for itself.
a fair taxation of biofuels is a more tricky issue as the actual ghg avoidance varies for each combination of plant location and chosen technology.
need for more common values in terms of how business operates and politicians to have a system based on gross national happiness as opposed to gross domestic product.
subsequently, favorable factor projections for different worldviews are combined into scenario skeletons, which are then elaborated into scenarios based on back-casting methodology.
by using all 6 of these processes in combination, collectively we can without great technical difficulty inexpensively and rather rapidly reverse the directional trends of climate change contamination and ocean acidification while we reclaim & re-use chemical fertilizers from a number of sources.
too many times, the approach to non-fossil energy has been driven by business interests which don’t always tell the whole truth without adequate consideration for what makes good public policy.
alberta, the canadian province i call home, is virtually paved with pipelines.
however electric cars and plug in hybrids today recharge at night and in the us that means about 50% of the power produced is coal based, not carbon neutral.
update the current national electrical grid into a “smart” grid, utilizing energy storage systems such as megabatteries, high voltage dc power lines, fly wheel storage technology, electric plug-in vehicle storage, and two-way information flow of energy usage and distribution.
we should not pretend that switching to renewable energy will automatically generate millions of “green jobs”.
it would in this case probably also be best to calculate ghg avoidance for different fuel options based on tonnes of feedstock used.
(inside our legal and political systems we can declare it nonetheless a natural right, but such declaration would most probably hold little water if any in the face of objective natural tests over future history)
please see my comments also best regards nam raj khatri one part of the way forward to reducing our carbon emissions would be to focus on cities.
this must include travel (train versus plane), pensions (high carbon investments versus low carbon investments), energy sources (electricity versus gas, renewable versus non etc) with the cost applied to one directly credited as a subsidy to the alternative.
share: leaders of the major carbon-emitting nations need to view climate change with the same sense of urgency that their historic forebears viewed world war ii.
the incorporation of biochar in soils has been shown to increase soil fertility while successfully sequestering carbon.
consequently these systems are anchored, in new behavioral norms and values, through integrated functions of which a clear example is the renewable energy case and the way it serves as a hedge against: - geo-political threats, like being dependent on russia and middle east - future scarcity of fuels like oil peak scenario’s etc based on experience, we are sure that consumers allocate their budgets on purchase decisions that maximize utility; consequently producers invest resources in production, with the market and price signals acting as coordinating mechanism.
although day lighting is the single-most important way to reduce electricity and carbon emissions, carbon neutral design requires a precise balance of light and heat.
it assumes (1) that a carbon neutral society would be a good thing, hence a desirable thing[i] , (2) that transition to such a society is first of all possible, and (3) that speeding up same transition is both desirable and possible.
the courage, the ambition to really drive the 2050 targets and the industrial revolution needed to get there.
all of our existing energy production methods require vast amounts of non-renewable resources – from steel and rare earths to fossil fuels.
in fact much of the wind generation in the midwest gets curtailed daily as transmission and distribution capacity is limited from these areas.
but other areas could include penalising householders with inefficient boilers, much higher taxes on car usage and taxes on the carbon footprint of various foodstuffs (which are quite well calculated these days).
i predict it will probably win out as the “800 pound gorilla” in the long run as we settle on a specific implementation and the learning curve kicks in; though i don’t rule out pv being a major player (once the initial investment is written off by bankruptcies as happened with fiber optics) and if storage technology matures.
although the frolicking billionaires of wall street hoped for a new junk bubble in bogus offset trading schemes such as cap-and-trade, that is not going to happen either.
3 stern estimates the costs of mitigation and adaptation at two percent of global gnp.
carbon neutrality means not making the co2 problem worse as we satisfy the need for more power.
consumer patters have to change, value chains redesigned, renewable materials used for production and in balance with their use for energy.
in the energy sector, sa can be used to assess the sustainability impacts of a wide range of initiatives, such as developing new power plants, assessing wind parks, assessing projects under the kyoto protocol’s flexible mechanisms, as our team did for clean development mechanism-projects in vietnam.
whether it’s climate change, peak oil, energy security, keeping the billions we spend on oil at home to grow our own economy, or competing with the likes of china for leadership in new industries, such as wind and solar, everyone can find a reason to move to a carbon neutral society.
provided we do, we need to understand that with the exception of drying our clothes in the sunlight, we do not possess any way of harnessing carbon free power.
we can talk about carbon taxes and carbon limitations, like what the us president is proposing for refineries, but there are just so many sources of carbon emissions we would unlikely get to all of them.
these stoves consume most of their carbon-containing gaseous emissions and generate stable; carbon-rich biochar that can be used to supplement the productivity of agricultural lands.
a range of stoves, for example, those sold by worldstove, are available, from small “nomad” or “backpacking” units, to family sized, to the large, community-sized pyrolysis units that also produce syngas and bio-oil.
but for accelerating the process, i see no better candidate than the big push.
when enough people get these new habits, and these habits are properly pubicized, a new culture can arise.
make it important to be well versed in science and technology so as to avoid buying the frequently offered snake oil solutions and be able to make educated choices.
ghg emission penalties via the fuel tax should also apply equally in all sectors (i.e. no special favours for certain industries or consumer groups).
need to redefine the measures of success for business, which should not always be driven by growth but other performance factors availability of low risk finance for low carbon investment or a self financing business model.
the current plethora of policies – subsidies for renewable energy (at different levels for different types), mandates for certain levels of renewable or low-carbon energy, a carbon trading system, compulsory shutdowns of fossil fuel power stations – is expensive/economically inefficient, and just weakens the price signal given by the eu’s cap & trade system.
operable windows allow for seasonal natural ventilation.
dramatically improve automobile fuel-economy, by double the current standards (michael c. ruppert, in his latest book, confronting collapse, points out that every tire, of which there are at least five on each car, requires 30 gallons of oil to manufacture – that’s 150 gallons of oil being used just to allow a car to roll on down the road) •
however, a real job that wind and solar might do is the conversion task, in electrolytic dissociation of co2 to make liquid fuel or elemental carbon, recycling the oxygen back into the plant for oxyfuel combustion or oxygen-blown gasification.
and to recognize that the added co2 from these sources, until we can technically and economically sequester the co2, will be offset by the need for the world to deploy geoengineering such as solar radiation management – with or without ctl/gtl should climate change prove to be sooner and greater than the most likely values.
so my bottom line is that we not press for more and more non-fossil energy resources, but we try to look not only at those that can achieve 20 to 30% but 80% as is the issue with the electric grid.
so far, the will to move forward has been lacking because of a lack of this vision.
but for now the coal india ipo illustrates the enormity of the mountain we have to climb in order to arrive there.
indeed, in this case it is not so much a gamble as a known outcome, if you believe the vast majority of climate scientists.
if these targets are indeed to be met, we need currency, courage, choices and creativity.
in a systematic way, based on scientific input and on participation.
investment in low-carbon technologies will bring huge economic benefits both regionally and nationally and will allow the uk government to realise its ambition to become a green leader.
share: “electricity should be as cheap as oxygen.”
after all, 80% less co2 means a carbon free power sector as the remaining 20% co2 will be needed in other sectors such as aviation and agriculture.
in a civilisation intent on ensuring its own survival, much less prosperity, we would be using home-made sources of renewable energy, with great efficiency and fairness, and investing our own money to roll out ever more green infrastructure with which to build resilient local and national economies, so creating worthwhile jobs for our children.
the weather is more pleasant than in copenhagen and the beaches are nice, but the chances of progress toward a new climate protocol are slim.
one is that some cities would have to shrink their size considerably because their surrounding region could simply not support their food needs.
it will also finance the development of cleaner technologies.
knowing we have little time, we should still find a system that leaves the door open for solutions that might look crazy today, but might make a lot of sense tomorrow.
this is because most of the energy we use comes from fuels like oil, coal, and gas.
if we could reduce co2 emissions without economic pain, then there would be no need for climate policy.
urban planning, the replacement of antiquated urban infrastructures and the development of institutional capacities can produce significant ghg reductions and lead to relatively rapid changes in residents’ energy consumption and behaviors.
so, no nation can be exempt from the responsibility of bringing their population to a sustainable level, preferably through the humanity of planned families, and not the inhumanity of floods, epidemics, and starvation.
however, the problem is completely different in the case of cloud computing systems.
so, they have committed sizeable resources towards reducing air pollution, slowing population increases, and developing a clean renewable energy industry.
the people or companies who are clean –those who are not spewing carbon into the air – are paying for the polluters.
there are also “willing developing countries” prepared to learn and cooperate; there may just not be enough time for these budding partnerships to evolve into effective global climate change protection.
if this rate continues, the heat (per square centimetre) produced by future intel processors would exceed that of the surface of the sun; this implies the possibility of worsening system reliability, eventually resulting in poor system performance.
one way to ensure that a carbon price would not act as a regressive tax would be to institute an additional luxury carbon emitter tax.
in this lack of power and control lies the most important instrument for speeding up such a transition.
proper communication based on correct surveys and correctly delivered can today, according to my own experience create the most effective change.
being “carbon neutral” means removing as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as we put in.
and invest the fund managers did, unfettered by risk regulation or any meaningful requirement to place a value on the climate consequences of their scramble for short-term profit.
sa is then an iterative, long-term, pro-active and explorative framework generating knowledge to feed the societal debate on how to tackle major challenges in a sustainable way.
look for natural gas-fired power plants to gradually replace coal as the electricity-generating mainstay in western countries.
even the fourth assessment report issued in 2007 by the ippc, the very scientific body founded by the unfccc to support international climate policy by producing (increasingly disturbing) data for cop negotiators, fails to sufficiently impress policymakers in the international community.
available resources should instead be used in a manner which maximizes the availability of transportation fuels and also required chemical industry feedstock.
third, ensuring that as the “braking” body moves past origin it will have the change in dynamic of influencing driving forces that will induce a/the new equilibrium to occur around the origin this time.
should the same resources and innovation be applied to clean technologies we would surely see a rapid change in energy generation, transport and the other industries that contribute most to our current emissions.
constraints: lack of an integrated system – we are not business or consumers or policy makers.
in the us, we just finished grueling elections that brought back some pretty extreme views, including denial that climate change is a factual reality.
so, we respond to quick fixes such as reduced consumption vehicles, turning the lights off, recycling etc while at the same time expecting continued economic growth exemplified by consumption of more items, greater freedom to travel and more accumulated wealth for our pensions.
but as of now we are short of good climate governance, and of the political will to put the available technological and policy tools into practice.
2- a number of research papers and projects on the renewable energy field, and the most important one is the model of the electric generation from the sea waves.
policies can address market barriers, for instance by reducing transaction costs via information campaigns and improved institutional capacity.
social scientists will tell you that the grounds for a negotiated climate deal are shaky.
institutional shareholders were particularly unsupportive.
mining canadian oil sands in particular requires multibillion-dollar capital investments that are typically paid back over long periods, which means mines currently up and running – and there are many – will not be switched off overnight.
i dare say complicated, since it seems to be a problem that needs to take into consideration a systemic view of the world–the one we live in which overall is at this current time rather accelerating its carbon production, hence still moving quite fast away from a carbon neutral society.
for sectors like ours, 2050 is two paper machine investments away.
pricing carbon is simply the fastest way to become carbon neutral and will also lead to some very positive unintended consequences: we would make significant headway toward balancing the budget.
prop 23 was voted down, but prop 26 passed – it requires a two-thirds vote to pass any new taxes on business, which will make it difficult to fund the climate change law.
my favorite electric grid generation approach – csp, solar thermal has built in storage and is probably less expensive to build than pv per kwh.
although some improvements are now in the pipeline following european legislation on energy-using products and the energy performance of buildings, there is plenty of scope for further action on the demand side, not to mention the potential for supply-side improvements to be had from reducing energy losses in electricity generation and transmission.
wind and solar and electric cars are all intended to reduce the carbon footprint.
many projects have died because of lack of it.
so, the solution does not uniquely lie in the technology, but, according to our experience in the proper balance between technology research and social acceptance.
the clean electricity would power not only homes and businesses, but also vehicles.
this kind of governance not only brings carbon at neutral also contribute to world democracy indirectly.
the machine that will be built tomorrow will still be there in 2040.
most of the technologies for the transition to a carbon-neutral society already exist, among others renewable energy resources, energy efficiency in housing and transportation, heat exchange systems and climate-friendly infrastructures.
today, the earth barely supports over 6 billion people from crops grown on only 10% of the earth’s surface.
going carbon neutral does not mean your country never produce any co2 emissions.
let me go on: the business interests pushing pv and wind have ignored storage for as long as they could.
similarly there is need to reorient our infrastructure rebuilding.
