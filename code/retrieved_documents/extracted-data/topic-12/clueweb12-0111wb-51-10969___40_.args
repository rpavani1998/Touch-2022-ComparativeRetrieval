soluble fiber also stabilizes blood glycemic levels because it regulates the rate at which food leaves the stomach, which helps keep appetite levels under control and is very helpful for diabetes.soluble fiber (both foods and supplements) not only normalizes bowel function, it also helps stabilize blood glycemic levels, slows the rate of carbohydrate absorption, improves regulation of blood sugar, and lowers insulin requirements.irritable bowel syndrome is estimated to affect 15-20% of the general population, but a much higher percentage of people with fibromyalgia suffer from ibs.soluble fiber is a miracle worker for many people in managing all ibs symptoms, whether cramping, diarrhea, and/or constipation.fiber supplements have health benefits in addition to controlling ibs symptoms.alcohol is very dehydrating, and becoming even slightly dehydrated can seriously impact constipation and bloating.sugar alcohols are so likely to cause gas, cramping, and bowel dysfunction that foods containing these sweeteners are labeled with a warning about their side effects, and cautions against eating a large amount.fats of all kinds are also triggers for constipation as well as diarrhea, because fats are a very powerful gi tract stimulant just like insoluble fiber.people with irritable bowel syndrome are statistically more likely to have upper gi problems (like gerd or reflux) as well.not only normalizes bowel function, it also helps stabilize blood glycemic levels.this will dramatically increase the safety of these insoluble fiber foods in terms of the strength of the gastrocolic reflex they trigger (people with ibs suffer from irregular gastrocolic reflexes, and are prone to having the muscle contractions triggered by this reflex go violently out of control, resulting in cramps, diarrhea, and/or constipation).carbonation in general is a potential trigger for ibs attacks, and it's particularly likely to exacerbate bloating.soluble fiber (both foods and supplements) not only normalizes bowel function, it also helps stabilize blood glycemic levels.there aren't any clear cut long-term studies on saccharine's or aspartame's effects on gastrointestinal health, but there is a lot of anecdotal evidence that they can cause digestive upsets, particularly if you're already susceptible to these problems.soluble fiber also decreases ldl ("bad") blood cholesterol levels, and therefore reduces the risk of heart disease, which is a serious risk for diabetics.
