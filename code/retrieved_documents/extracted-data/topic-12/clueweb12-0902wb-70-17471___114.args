i personally hope the tsa continues to find weapons and real dangers, but i cannot support it's ever expanding scope of trading liberty for so-called security.
we’ve caught everything from spring breakers with terrible ids tofraudulent passports .
and i sincerely hope you do not feel that anyone at tsa is mocking you.
her old drivers license was destroyed.
meanwhile, i find it curious that you don't address the fact that the id check is essentially useless if the terrorist does have valid id.
while the memory isn't as good as it once was i can tell you when i first heard about it and where i first heard about it.
lots of people sitting around getting paid big bucks to watch tv!
at the same time, i will not berate them for being members of the american stasi or similar, for they are just trying to do their poorly defined job.
any mis-step, abusive behavior or any other action that i feel violates my civil rights by anyone working for tsa will be met with maximum effort complaints.
by increasing our options, people with bad intentions don’t know what exactly to plan against, have to beat multiple layers at the checkpoint and need to be ready to face any number of obstacles to their plans."
this might make it a little bit harder for them to get a fake id, but matter how much technology we put into identification cards, a criminal will be able to either get a false id or "steal" someone else's identity and get a card with his picture and the other person's name.
to do that, you have to be able to identify people.
damn straight i’ll keep holding government agencies accountable.
id checks at the checkpoints accomplish nothing toward that end.
the no-fly list is a disaster.
your ground-level staff are uneducated and poorly paid, and when they're not making up rules on the spot they're improperly and inconsistently enforcing the ones that do exist.
enhancing our id requirements further enables tsa security officers to ensure that individuals are who they say they are when they enter the security checkpoint and not individuals who may pose a threat.
nix the interviews and give us our pat downs, but keep it at that.
i can print my real boarding pass and an identical copy with a different name.
this way the tsa could launch an emergency secret investigation of anyone who doesn't show id.
they are working on pr blogs and new uniforms with shiny badges while not checking air cargo.
for the life of me, i couldn't imagine that chertoff and hawley would not have followed the law of the land to the letter.
june 11, 2008 7:17 pm "circumventing watch list matching" is a joke and will remain a joke even after the implementation date.
it's pure and simple retaliation for not getting his way with real id.
then some idiot failed to hurt anybody and i had to take off my shoes.
thank you tsa for continuing to trample on the constitution and then mock those of us who care.
note that the new tsa rule that will become effective june 21, 2008, does not require potential airline passengers to present credentials (i.e., to "show id"); that will still be optional, and will still help people avoid a more thorough secondary screening.
july 1, 2008 2:16 pm "people willing to trade their freedom for temporary security deserve neither and will lose both.
if they don't have the "pointy objects", in your terms, they can't harm the aircraft.
the tsa knows it can't deny people without id from taking a flight so instead you will not allow them in the boarding area.
in gilmore, the government said that producing id was not required to travel and you were only subjected to a secondary search.
ben franklin is attriubuted to saying "they who would give up an essential liberty for temporary security, deserve neither liberty or security."
" so, i noticed the last time i flew, that the id checker used a black light and loupe (sp?) on my passport when matching the names.
tsa looks like the keystone cops, and as you know they were fools!
june 16, 2008 8:50 pm anonymous said: the trouble with so much of this criticism is the lack of understanding by people outside the security field.
actually, it’s an effort to keep people that pose a threat to aviation off airplanes and keep you, your family and mine safe."
at the airport, use the fake boarding pass and your valid id to get through security.
christopher also said: "instead of allowing anyone without an id to show up, go through a quick pat down and bag check, circumventing watch list matching, we’re now opening up the options to include interviews with behavior detection officers and law enforcement; options no real terrorist is looking forward to and ones that legitimate passengers will find quicker and more convenient than today’s process.
june 16, 2008 6:29 pm the trouble with so much of this criticism is the lack of understanding by people outside the security field.
so eather way the security at the airport are darned if they do and darned if they do not by people like all of you.
no unconstitutional restraints on anyone's right to travel is imposed by the challenged statutes and regulations.
i will pity them, but i will not berate them, for they are unaware of how poorly they fit their job description.
the one thing i've given tsa *any* credit on since this blog's establishment has been the fact that you did not appear to be afraid of posting comments which are openly and strongly critical of your agency - it would be a shame for you to reveal that there truly are no redeeming qualities to it at all...
june 11, 2008 6:01 pm too many holes in this feeble attempt to say that it enhances security.
they won't be able to fly without ssss.
no, and i hope that our military keeps those terrorists off of us soil.
“if the security systems actually worked then there would be no need to check id.”
to second guess and hold in check wanton power grabs by the government, its agencies and my countrymen who abet them is my right as a citizen.
show me just one terrorist that you have apprehended.
maybe the fact that michael chertoff is an israeli citizen makes the idea of presenting travel papers appealing to him.
you wrote that beginning june 21, you will require passengers to present id.
when the tso looking at my bags via an x-ray machine can recognize the difference between a flash drive and a knife, i will recognize them as being properly trained and deserving of respect.
june 24, 2008 12:47 am someone claiming to be a tsa agent wrote: "when you buy your ticket it saids go to whatever website and read the rules, but people don't take time out to read them for whatever reason.
like in the previous article, a comment was made that the 9/11 terrorists all had valid id's and used their real names.
under today’s rules, you show up, say you lost your id, get a quick pat down, have your bag searched and you’re on your way.
in california, you have the right to use any name you wish, as long as you are not doing so to commit fraud.
if, for example, the tdc checker missed that they were a selectee, then the tso at the wtmd could catch it.
honest people, however, go to pro-life rallies.
when the tsa or any government agency tries to steal my liberty, or my rights, i take it personally.
the third-party company that handled his travel arrangements fit, 100% of the time, into the capps profile for what it desigates as selectees.
let true, centuries-old intelligence agencies (fbi, nsa) do the work.
you will be as guilty as your leaders and just as accountable.
this plan includes enabling our officers to refuse entry into the area beyond the security checkpoint to anyone who does not cooperate with us to establish his or her identity.
if we started letting anyone through and the terrorist attacked, then you would blame the security for not doing their job.
i will hold them accountable for wasting billions of dollars and time, subjecting us to all this crap and it not making a lick of difference.
it's interesting to note that most of the instances of passengers being caught with falsified id cards and passports that are described ontsa's "travel document checker (tdc)" web page (under "travel document checking success stories") were arrested on charges of immigrations violations, possession of illegal drugs, or credit card theft.
seriously, this is rapidly moving from security theater to clown-car security.
theory #2: it could also be intentional on grounds of redundancy.
unfortunately, many younger americans have been so conditioned to presenting credentials (usually a driver license) to private parties that they fail to see the risk of being required to do so in order to pass government checkpoints.
or the no-fly list that homeland security chief michael chertoff said indicated caused one major carrier to have 9,000 false positives on any given day.
gilmore wasn't required to provide id to a federal employee.
you remind me of every other typical american who has forgoten about 9/11.
if anyone wants to pony up the dough, i could use a hawaiian or alaskan vacation.
i asked him a few questions in regard to how he flew - without exception, he was flying on business, as is the case for most of the travelers that leave out of huntsville.
if i don't have my id and you request extra screening, no problem as that is reasonable.
unfortunately, as has been demonstrated many, many times before, it's much too easy to design fake boarding passes that look 100% real, even to these so-called trained inspectors (see: boing boing).
the truth is that you are not requiring id, but plan to continue to coerce people into voluntarily showing id and also to harass travelers who wish to exercise their right to travel and associate without interference from their government.
to second guess the agencies under his control is foolish.
june 11, 2008 6:09 pm let’s think about this: making sure the guy sitting next to you on the plane isn’t a terrorist is about as basic as security gets.
i mean what the hell, if osama or mohammed just want to case the joint out, you know test the system, then it's okay with you.
if you truly will stand on your principle, you will....if you don't and simply rant for rant's sake, i'll see you in the sterile area with your pocket constitution and valid government issued id.
"if we started letting anyone through and the terrorist attacked, then you would blame the security for not doing their job."
those are reserved for the judicial branch.
june 15, 2008 2:28 pm chris responded to one comment: “if the security systems actually worked then there would be no need to check id.”
june 18, 2008 1:11 pm the trouble with so much of this criticism is the lack of understanding by people outside the security field.
it is clear that the inmates are running the asylum -- and that you guys are making this stuff up as you go along.
no, they knew they could never take us on in military might, but they knew they could get us to implode from the inside.
because right now, all one has to do is print their own fake boarding pass (e.g., use an old boarding pass and change the name, date, and flight number with graphics program and reprint it) that matches their id.
those people can't bring down the plane by being drunk on the plane, but they can and often do disrupt the flight, the airport environment, the other passengers, and everyone around them.
[...] travel document checkers are tsa officers that are specially trained to detect fraudulent ids and boarding passes to help keep our airports safe and secure.
acci argues that the statutes and regulations it violated are unconstitutional restrictions on the right to travel because not everyone can afford to pay the higher fares on regular flights to europe.
then, save that web page as a pdf and use adobe acrobat to change the name on the boarding pass to your own.
ergo, a hypothetical scenario: on the first day, we're told to verify the presence of the boarding pass when the passenger comes through the walk-through metal detector.
this is just another dragnet to try to justify tsa's existence, and turn us into a police state.
they can't challenge the tsa about their status or prove their innocence.
if a lawyer at the tsa signed off on this based on the gilmore vs. ashcroft (now gonzales) case, they need to find another profession.
listen, liquids are hazmat or they're not, you need to publicly show the mmw screens, teach your staff some manners and common sense (and lose the faux-cop uniforms), and for god's sake stop making up newer and dumber policies and start examining your weaknesses honestly.
we are not allowed to know who is on the list, who put them there, or why they were put on it.
on one hand, it is true that tsa with its visual inspection of id and boarding pass has corectly verified that i am indeed who i claim to be (john badman), on the other hand, the tsa agent has no idea that john badman is someone who shouldn't be allowed to fly.
today, any terrorist smart enough to google "print your own boarding pass" can bypass the no-fly list.
no fly today, smacks of retribution on the part of tsa.
june 24, 2009 10:42 pm traveling a lot, i feel relieved with the level of security the tsa provides.
under your new order, the passenger has no choice.
sincerely, an ex-tsa fan june 12, 2008 4:16 am the tsa should continue to allow refusal to show id without enhanced visible screening.
june 11, 2008 9:22 pm don't get too upset, everyone -- the industry is unsustainable as-is anyway (see articles like http://www.kpho.com/news/16577581/detail.html), so we should only have to deal with this for about another decade or so (depending on how many bailouts at taxpayer expense the industry gets before collapsing completely).
let’s think about this: instead of allowing anyone without an id to show up, go through a quick pat down and bag check, circumventing watch list matching, we’re now opening up the options to include interviews with behavior detection officers and law enforcement; options no real terrorist is looking forward to and ones that legitimate passengers will find quicker and more convenient than today’s process.
it has prevented exactly zero terrorists from flying.
i am the person that in open court has told a judge that he is running a kangaroo court and should be ashamed of himself.
seriously, though, you people seriously messed up.
if the security systems actually worked then there would be no need to check id.
when a government agent asks me to show my papers or searches me, i feel *un*safe.
stick to actually looking for things which can threaten the safety of the aircraft, and come back and talk to us again after you can consistently get an exemplary grade (let alone a passing one, which you're nowhere near).
until then, they are but costume-wearers looking for a free donut.
the airlines deny boarding to drunk passengers all the time.
if they did, the entire dhs would look entirely different and the tsa would not exist.
you will not allow us to know how they got there or how to get off of it. "to [restrict travel based on our secret blacklist, we] have to be able to identify people." agreed.
honest people go to pro-choice rallies, too.
note that even if you fail at a and b, a terrorist organization can still trivially defeat any id checkpoint by using the "carnival booth" algorithm (google for more details).
when every tso is well trained, and knows how to do their job properly, i fully expect that the tsa will immediately change all the rules for some poorly thought out and undefined 'security reason.'
if they do not accept instruction, i will immediately request to speak to their supervisor without getting out of line or attempting to repack my bags.
sometimes implementing new policies and procedures helps them figure out what is working and what is not, so they can make better changes in the future.
the airline checks boarding passes against tickets when people board the plane.
i don't think anybody wants to ride a welfare airline.
any time saved when people volunteer to show id comes at the cost of less effectively checking them for dangerous items.
the fact is: the tsa jurisdiction is limited to 5% of the airfields in the country, and then again limited to the commercial side at those locations.
june 24, 2008 1:03 am i do not see how the requirement to show valid id that proves that the person holding the boarding pass is the person able to fly on the ticket makes tsa the enemy.
then you can either produce the id, or turn around and explain to the others waiting to go somewhere why your act of revivalist 60s numbskullery is interfering with their "right" to travel.
if i'm not polite at the checkpoint, perhaps it's because you guys keep increasing the number of hoops for me to jump through without actually making me any safer.
the whole process is just too demeaning.
the people examining him and the documents have _no_ idea if that name is on the no fly list.
i know if i tried to stick my hand in the till, ali or muhammad would make sure i pulled back a nub.
"this new procedure will not affect passengers that may have misplaced, lost or otherwise do not have id but are cooperative with officers."
the airlines support these measures, because it sells more tickets.
hats off to the security at any cost folks as you've given up constitutional rights for the sake of a nanny state.
this id policy is rank nonsense, up there with 3.4-1-1, since it presumes that no terrorist is capable of saying, "i lost my id."
under the law that created tsa, the aviation and transportation security act, the tsa administrator is responsible for overseeing aviation security (p.l. 107-71) and has the authority to establish security procedures at airports (49 c.f.r. § 1540.107).
why this would be so is beyond me, but it works as good personal proof that the lists are fundamentally flawed.
just in case you think this important issue just "slipped their minds" the right to travel between the states has been a right since the articles of confederation, the first constitution, that created the united states of america.
on the second day, we're told to take over the travel document checking role previously held by contracted airline personnel.
i also do not have looks or a name that could be considered "suspicious" (whatever that is).
june 17, 2008 7:12 pm checking ids to try to find terrorists is useless because of the low number of terrorists, and the false positive rate of using id checks as a proxy for terrorist intent.
do it quietly and no one will notice.
try working through this page with terrorism as cancer, 2,000,000 people per day, and any tsa "detection" program you can think of.
the wtmd operator does not have a copy.
consider...sticks and stones can break my bones, but names will never hurt me.
they are triple checking boarding passes and confiscating water from passengers while some people with airside access receive limited checks.
if i were you, i'd be taking a good long look at some of our concerns about the dumping of hazmat in open trash cans in public areas.
i want someone who posesses much better administrator skills than he apparently posesses.
we will weed out the dumb ones....but the smart will keep on going.
fema, an agency under the control of michael chertoff, absolutely failed during katrina's aftermath.
june 11, 2008 10:36 pm remember, in gilmore v. gonzales, gilmore did not possess government-issued photo identification.
anyone who wants to can fly in private aircraft, without showing id, luggage searches, or being delayed for bottled drinks, personal appearance, choice of clothing, or other trivial issues.
if the passenger decides to uphold his right not to present papers the tsa can invoke penalties.
the better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different states in this union,the free inhabitants of each of these states, paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from justice excepted, shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several states; andthe people of each state shall free ingress and regress to and from any other state, and shall enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and commerce, subject to the same duties, impositions, and restrictions as the inhabitants thereof respectively, provided that such restrictions shall not extend so far as to prevent the removal of property imported into any state, to any other state, of which the owner is an inhabitant; provided also that no imposition, duties or restriction shall be laid by any state, on the property of the united states, or either of them.
january 5, 2009 6:56 pm this is so against the u.s constitution.
i've heard of a lot of 5 yr olds, grandmothers, and others hastled, delyed, ssssearched and annoyed by the process, but few or no big fish caught by your agency.
according to this, under some circumstances passengers who have not shown id will be granted access to the sterile area.
this will not ensure that people are who they say they are.
they won't be allowed many things.
[tsa blog guy]christopher said: "and i sincerely hope you do not feel that anyone at tsa is mocking you.
if you really need to get to where you are flying to, just follow the rules and regulations.
june 15, 2008 6:07 pm y'all need to chill out!...u people have too much time in your hands to sit in ur computers and do all this ridiculous blogging....the constitution is waaaaayyy too old to reflect the modern/changing times, you can't deny this....when they wrote people have a right to "bear arms" they didn't meant anybody could buy a gun to kill the first person they see on the street, did they?...

tahe xray operator does not have a copy.
if i'm not mistaken, you would rather the tsa not catch terrorist if they don't have "pointy things" on them at this moment.
also please explain how the residents of the 10 states that refuse to comply with the onerous real id will be handled by the tsa.
june 24, 2008 6:49 pm anonymous said... i do not see how the requirement to show valid id that proves that the person holding the boarding pass is the person able to fly on the ticket makes tsa the enemy.
theory #1: this caused by one thing being added while another thing wasn't taken away in our operating procedures.
a compliant and docile populace isn't in anyone's best interest!
people can show their id to whomever they want, whenever they want to do so, if it makes them feel safer.
unlike mr. gilmore, mr. miller is still free to use the roads as a passenger.
there are lot of people in large cities who don't drive and don't have id.
the under secretary may waive requirements for an analysis that estimates the number of lives that will be saved by the regulation and the monetary value of such lives if the under secretary determines that it is not feasible to make such an estimate.
of course, higher air tariffs will limit travel of those who cannot pay the price.
probability laws point out to my being on a watch list (ridiculous, since i have absolutely no connection that could be regarded as remotely "worrisome").
i've brought marshmallows, who has the sticks.
i think i get it - none of them will be allowed in the sterile area.
and it's another excuse for tsos to badger and harass innocent people who forget their id, now that they can be officially denied travel based on a subjective judgment of "cooperation."
unfortunately, they're going to be scapegoats no matter what because when something happens again, congress will get up in arms about it.
because the tsa requirement seems to be targeted to this kind of expressive conduct (hence the exception for lost or stolen ids), it may run afoul of the first amendment."
first of all, chertoff doesn't have time to know "the depth of the threat".
regardless of the deficiencies and inconveniences, it is still the safest system we have ever had.
so lets say as soon as i came up to a id checkpoint with "no id" written on my boarding pass, the officer would immediately contact his supervisor.
every passenger is screened twice: once to get into the secure area of the airport, another time to get into the specific waiting lounge for the gate.
[terrorists] if they don't have "pointy things" on them at this moment.
it was cooperating with the hijackers and letting them take control of the cockpits that caused it.
because of this lack of choice, the id order creates an envioroment that is diametrical to the right of all citizens to be “free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this movement".
show me how to fly without entering the sterile area and i will agree with you.
this would be security theater if you did this for the purpose of catching the bad guys, but for that to be true you need to be doing this to catch the bad guys.
june 11, 2008 6:44 pm i always show id when asked - don't think it is a big deal although i understand who doesn't want to show it.
by increasing our options, people with bad intentions don’t know what exactly to plan against, have to beat multiple layers at the checkpoint and need to be ready to face any number of obstacles to their plans.
tsa has never done anything to improve airport security.
june 23, 2008 11:25 pm anonymous said... i don't see the big problem here.
while i believe that the integrity of travel documents is vital, when i handed my european passport containing a us visa to a trained document checker at sdf on friday, she told me that she was unable to verify the photo on my visa, and asked for secondary id, since she was unable to see a photo in my passport.
first of all, i'd like to show my appreciation for making a blog entry about this.
and he's still having hissy fits, this time because he's not getting his way with real id.
in so holding, we considered several airport screening procedures, including behavioral profiling, magnetometer screening, identification check, and physical search of the passenger’s person and carry-on baggage.
it's time that our government stops throwing law abiding citizens into the same category as terorists.
the dog was barfing and i hit "post" before hurrying to get him out the door.
we're told to do this, without the procedures from the first day being rescinded.
i am not submissive to overbearing authority.
not on more useless rules that punish free thought and civil disobedience.
you have completely failed to explain how requiring people to identify themselves to government agents prior to traveling within the united states will improve transportation security.
right to travel [11] gilmore alleges that the identification policy violates his constitutional right to travel because he cannot travel by commercial airlines without presenting identification, which is an impermissible federal condition.
we have to remember that we really are dealing with human beings here.
passengers who fail to comply with security procedures may be prohibited from entering the secure area of airports to catch their flight (49 c.f.r. § 1540.105(a)(2).
this is yet another example of tsa mission creep, and yet the american people put up with it.
just in case you are curious about the monarch travel services v. associated cultural clubs case cited; acci was in the transportation business thinly disguised as a club.
did you know that a cop can only force you to identify yourself when he/she can articulate reasonable suspicion that a crime is about to be committed?
i hate to break it to you, but there are plenty of terrorists out there that aren't on any no-fly list, and if they were getting on a plane, there would be nothing stopping them from using their own perfectly valid id.
thetraitor presently in control of this nation reminds us of it every chance he gets.
all of the 9/11 terrorists had valid identification.
anyone could have picked up my identification and gone through security as me!
in it, schneier writes: "anyone on the no-fly list can easily fly whenever he wants.
whether it is the electronic strip search or the high school drop out "security professional" that will interrogate you, your spouse and your children for hours because he/she can; the only response possible by the people is to abandon commercial airlines as a travel option.
either the courts or the legislators will be sure the long arm of the tsa is shortened.
additionally, gilmore was free to decline both options and use a different mode of transportation.
the people are no longer going to put up with your antics and your bullying.
but because no one checks ticketed names against ids, the security breaks down.
if i'm going on a trip, i shouldn't have to remember to take it out of the glove compartment to board an airplane.
january 5, 2009 7:03 pm i agree january 5, 2009 7:03 pm sadly, airline security is no better today than it was on 9/11.
" september 10, 2008 11:52 am this is so against constitution and the people who are in favor are also agreeing that the government is violating our civil rights!!!!!!
this is proof positive that the id requirement is not about security; it's about control, pure and simple.
can't access the boarding area, can't get on your plane.
at security checkpoints, the tsa just matches ids to whatever is printed on the boarding passes.
june 12, 2008 4:24 pm "starting june 21, that person could be subjected to a range of options, including interviews with behavior detection officers, local and/or federal law enforcement, enhanced pat-downs or other options.
as the intelligence people become more intelligent and the law enforcement peeps plus local and state govies become a little more picky about the id rules in general, don’t you think it’s going to be a little bit harder for terrorists to obtain real ids in the first place?
the no-fly list -- a list of people so dangerous they are not allowed to fly yet so innocent we can't arrest them -- and the less dangerous "watch list" contain a combined 1 million names representing the identities and aliases of an estimated 400,000 people.
i think that america is really doing the best that they can.
then i fake up my boarding pass and change the passenger name from john cleanname to john badman.
[tsa blog guy]christopher said: "making sure the guy sitting next to you on the plane isn’t a terrorist is about as basic as security gets."
tsa wouldn't (or shouldn't) be held to account if they actually did security right.
i feel well-protected against terrorists who can't lie.
setting up a checkpoint at airports to stop everyone just to find the few criminals is un-american, and probably unconstitutional.
in the united states, we are innocent in the eyes of the law until proven guilty.
the tsa's new id requirement does not pass the test that allows us to free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this movement.
as hawley himself said, only the dumb get caught; sophisticated terrorists are not dumb.
the key to airport security is that someone doesn't have dangerous items on them.
it doesn't do fine detail very well.
june 12, 2008 2:49 pm dear hsvtso dean, thank you for the information regarding possible reasons for harassssment (love the term).
"this new requirement is meant for the person that simply won’t produce id nor work with us to determine that they’re not someone that poses a threat to that flight."
if you want to take action based on the fact someone will someday become a terrorist by committing an act of terrorism, you will need to check your crystal ball.
this gives authorities the chance to discover i'm actually a terrorist and have me attested without me knowing that they were investigating me the whole time.
that in turn can be defeated by determined evil-doers by the production of a fake id with a matching name.
they won't be allowed entry into federal buildings.
"enhancing our id requirements further enable tsa security officers to ensure that individuals are who they say they are when they enter the security checkpoint and not individuals that may pose a threat."
while the liquid policy is stupid, pointless, and silly, it's somewhat reasonable compared to this id policy, especially for domestic travel.
" your employer makes rules that we are required to follow but we are not allowed to read.
being required to show an id to the screener or risk being denied the right to travel and the right to free trade is losing essential liberties.
if you dare to stand up for your rights, you will not fly.
very true the id requirement in the gilmore case was not an unreasonable burden because gilmore could have opted for a secondary screening instead.
in the updated post, you tout finding another non-terrorist as a 'success': "the port authority police department released the passenger after issuing a summons to appear."
my family, when they travel, drive so as to not subject us to the security theater called tsa.
your agency is, judging from the available evidence, clumsy and slow to act, totally unable to balance safety and customer service, in a pr free fall you've been trying (and failing) to get out of since your inception due to your numerous public screwups.
tsa will continue to come out with more and more restrictive policies and give their "officers" more power.
as an avid flier, i want to make sure that the john doe sitting next to me is really john doe.
that supervisor would then start dispatching undercover officers and investigators.
that gives way to a police state feeling, which is unamerican.
christopher eos blog team update: 6/14/08 just a quick note… our ticket checkers found a fraudulent id at jfk.
1) he refused to show an airline employee his id.
june 16, 2008 1:00 am blogger bob posted breaking news on 6/14/08 at new york kennedy airport (jfk) on thursday, june 12, a passenger was interviewed by police after attempting to enter into a security checkpoint with a fraudulent id.
and again, you aren't doing all that well just looking for those things.
it's a job-creation program sold as "security" paid by tax payers and the flying public.
it sure is a good thing that terrorists won't lie and can't pass a behavioral interview.
prior to my flight, i check-in online, and print the boarding pass for john cleanname.
dhs/tsa cannot be trusted and prove it everyday.
if someone is a known terrorist, i doubt he's going to walk into a government office to request an id.
christopher said: "making sure the guy sitting next to you on the plane isn’t a terrorist is about as basic as security gets."
if the guy next to me has been properly screened, then explain to me how he plans on bringing the plane down.
he used and gave his real name, yet he was prevented from making his flight (in order to meet with his congressional representative).
osama's probably laughing his tail off in his cave.
the tso doesn't compare it against the no fly list.
i knew that wasn't true, and i didn't show id.
the only point of the new rules is to train us not to question the authority of the government (which derives from us).
right to travel [11] gilmore alleges that the identification policy violates his constitutional right to travel because he cannot travel by commercial airlines without presenting identification, which is an impermissible federal condition.10
one might argue that the gate staff should do a secondary match to make sure that i have and id that matches the boarding pass, which in turn matches their passenger manifest.
this farce of id's at the checkpoint is merely a revenue protection mechanism for the airlines -- it allows them to charge exorbitant change fees and cancellation fees.
no one is complaining about "adding extra security".
june 12, 2008 12:57 pm sad to see of what became of the "land of the free" in just a few short years.
many people who have found themselves on the list are u.s. citizens who have no ties to any terrorist organization.
frankly asking me to trust that those low-res images that were put up are what the screeners see is asking a lot.
one could successfully argue that this is what our government is doing already.
if you are going to blow smoke at least light the cigar first.
i will not be a smart*ss and hand the tso the printed copy of the x-ray machines operator manual.
as has been pointed out previously, both on this thread as well as others, if those on the tsa's assorted 'watch lists' are so dangerous, they should be arrested, charged, & tried in a court of law.
the port authority police department released the passenger after issuing a summons to appear.
" tell us, christopher, how you personally would be able to identify if a passenger were on the no-fly list?
at home, before your flight, check in online and print out your boarding pass.
paraphrasing words of the identity project: no matter how sophisticated the security embedded into an i.d., a well-funded criminal will be able to falsify it.
the only reason we’re doing this is to make sure people are who they say they are and not someone who is a known threat to aviation.
the low rate of terrorism, and the false positives that tsa touts so loudly make it clear that tsa is huge waste.
the denial of a driver's license due to lack of documentation does not equal denial of air travel.
you stay in bed and your risks for some forms of death increase dramatically.
when the federal government is trying it's damndest to catch the islomafascist terrorist from killing us all you bitch that you might have to show an id.
my last set of boarding passes were printed on paper that felt like a cheap wal-mart receipt.
we value this opportunity to discuss important issues with the traveling public and cherish the opportunity to communicate directly with you.
you don't need a knife or gun to kill someone as someone with the desire can do so with a pen.
and as far as i know, the tsos have no way to validate the boarding pass.
we're less free than we used to be and we're certainly not brave anymore.
whenever the tso asks for my id i will hand the pocket constitution to the tso."
but tsa doesn't do much to protect us from terrorists!!!!!!
anybody who has seen the innards of the freedom center can tell you it is far more than a big screen tv with cnn and fox.
although we remanded for further consideration of whether the defendant consented to the search, we held that airport screening searches of potential passengers and their immediate possessions for weapons and explosives is reasonable so long as each potential passenger maintains the right to leave the airport instead of submitting to the search.
we're being lied to about federal air travel policies by airport security at kci and other locations, and it's not making us any safer.
this is really simple: if someone is so dangerous that he shouldn't be allowed to travel within the country, we should send the police to arrest that person and get him in front of a judge -- not wait for him to show up at an airport, then hassle him or turn him away.
i also choose not to let the terrorists win by giving our our way of life and cowering in fear of them.
the poor man's lack of choice in his mode of travel may be unfortunate, but it is not unconstitutional.
security didn't fail on 9/11.
and of course, the troublesome part is that we are not allowed to pass this checkpoint without identifying ourselves in a manner that is acceptable to the government agents there, then waiting for permission to proceed.
(although i still stand by the opinion that if someone ever tries to hijack an airplane ever again, every person on that plane will stand up and beat that hijacker into a bloody pulp.) june 11, 2008 5:59 pm as bruce schneier said, i now feel well protected from the threat of terrorists who can't lie.
absolutely not…this rule is solely focused on the passenger who simply will not provide id or help us establish their identity.
june 16, 2008 7:27 pm in your blog, you indicate the exclusive reason is to ensure people are who they say they are and not gaming the system using a boarding pass with a fake name.
as i see it, the tsa's main function is not to catch them anyway, it is to prevent highjackings by keeping weapons off of airplanes.
june 12, 2008 1:35 pm i think this policy is wrong and in no way improves security one iota.
they pass him into the 'secure' area.
they modify the ticket to bear the name of the someone on the no fly list.
"stop complaining because people easily forget about what happened on 9/11 and after that tragic event.
june 17, 2008 8:11 am checking ids is essentially useless.
they have grounded infants, all john smiths in the country and even air marshals!
trollkiller wrote: "under the new rule showing id is a requirement to be granted access to the sterile area.
then, beginning with the following paragraph, you explained that some passengers will not be required to present id.
june 11, 2008 9:24 pm if a person is not carrying anything that is capable of harming an airplane, they are not a threat to the flight.
secondarily, there is another comprehensive security screening at what's called the gate-hold area.
use one to get through security and one to board the flight.
those people who are willing to simply lie to you, helping to convince everyone else that it is okay to ask for permission from their government before traveling within their own country, will be unaffected by your new rule.
i was at the holocaust museum a few weeks ago and in "daniel's story", the boy told about how they needed papers to do anything and were subject to inspection of those papers and goods at any time.
now i buy a ticket with a fake name such as john cleanname which is not on the no-fly list.
if i am not driving the thing i don't need a license.
a tsa travel document checker noticed a passenger trying to use a fraudulent new york driver’s license and notified the port authority police department who came and interviewed her.
note the court affirms it is the right of citizens to travel uninhibited by rules, regulations that are an unreasonable burden or restrict movement.
as a matter of fact, i'm laughing at your efforts to impress any kettles who might be reading this blog.
this will eventually cause a light bulb to go off.
travel document checkers are tsa officers that are specially trained to detect fraudulent ids and boarding passes to help keep our airports safe and secure.
our courts have established that people in this country have the right to travel and associate without being monitored or stopped by the government unless they have been convicted of committing a crime or are suspected -- with good reason -- of having committed a crime.
if he's not believed to be of sufficient danger to have him arrested, then we should let him go about his business.
the no fly list inconveniences thousands of people everyday even ones with common names like robert johnson, david nelson, and so forth and does nothing to prevent a terrorist to get on a plane.
it's not against the constitution to require id or it wouldn't have been allowed all this time folks.
"if a terrorist has no weapons that can be used, then there’s no way that the terrorist can harm the passengers or the aircraft.
they show up at the airport and present the doctored ticket and an id that matches.
"instead of allowing anyone without an id to show up, go through a quick pat down and bag check, circumventing watch list matching, we’re now opening up the options to include interviews with behavior detection officers and law enforcement; options no real terrorist is looking forward to and ones that legitimate passengers will find quicker and more convenient than today’s process.
when you buy your ticket it saids go to whatever website and read the rules, but people don't take time out to read them for whatever reason.
gilmore refused to show id to tsa and also refused to undergo the more thorough "secondary screening" search.
june 12, 2008 8:14 am christopher in the column said: "this initiative is simply a way for us to better enforce the no-fly list and ensure the safety of the traveling public.
i received aresponse from jeanne oliver, associate director of tsa office of the executive secretariat.
you *aren't* checking the no-fly list (an odious concept in and of itself in which someone too innocent to arrest is too dangerous to fly, and which contains numerous children while deliberately excluding known terrorists.
we can and do call upon tsa to ensure safe air travel by preventing people from carrying dangerous items onto flights.
(the u.s. 9th circuit court of appeals decided this month that no-fly passengers can sue the fbi, but that strategy hasn't been tried yet.)
if you have a list of terrorists and suspected terrorists, don't wait for them to show up at an airport and identify themselves to you; hand your list over to the police so they can go arrest those people and get them in front of a judge.
the freedom center is not even in arlington.
so through gilmore's activist actions intent on undoing id requirements to fly, he did the exact opposite and compelled one of the most liberal activist courts in this country to reject his claim and create the case law that this requirement will be based upon.
people who show id receive a less-thorough screening.
the tsa says that soon real id will be the only valid id.
for you tso's to just say i was following orders won't cut it if the order was unlawful.
i don't want the government tracking anything i do.
true the constitution does not explicitly cover the right to travel, common law does.
he eventually lost his case before the 9th circuit of the u.s. court of appeals which recognized that persons have the right to travel, but not necessarily by airplane.
they couldn't travel freely.
they can't even write documents on their own web site that show any consistancy at all (i.e. 3-1-1).
since keeping people who are the no-fly list off the flights this must be accomplished or no reason exist for this procedure.
keep in mind this will greatly inconvenience people, but especially those who are deaf, mute, has religious beliefs, and those who are autistic.
restricting travel based on an id check simply cannot improve security.
at the security checkpoint, i present my fake boarding pass, and my authentic, government issued id for john badman.
june 12, 2008 11:24 am an anonymous person wrote: after getting ssss boarding passes 15 times in a row, i have come to the sad conclusion that my name must be on a "watch list".
honest people attend gun shows.
the exclusive reason to do this is to ensure people are who they say they are and are not gaming the system by using a boarding pass with a fake name; a well-known endeavor of professionals andcollege kids alike that could potentially circumvent the no-fly list.
june 11, 2008 6:46 pm christopher of the eos blog team wrote: "making sure the guy sitting next to you on the plane isn’t a terrorist is about as basic as security gets.
actually, it’s an effort to keep people that pose a threat to aviation off airplanes and keep you, your family and mine safe.
many americans thought we'd never see the day that, like people living in cold-war ussr and under other totalitarian regimes, we would be stopped by government agents at a checkpoint and required to identify ourselves & get permission to proceed.
you ignore valid questions, post meaningless pr drivel, and insult us by spinning your screwups as triumphs.

now i not only have to show my id, i have to remove it from the clear plastic carrier in my wallet.
in your quest for all-but-nonexistent "people with bad intentions" you will harass and interrogate and waste the time of thousands and thousands of citizens guilty of absolutely nothing more than forgetting their wallet or having their purse stolen on a business trip.
if he is a terrorist, he is probably in prison.
turns out, the third-party that handled all of the company's travel arrangements typically made said arrangements within twenty-four hours of the flight.
these policies are hurting the economy by decimating tourism.
june 17, 2008 1:29 pm anonymous said... the trouble with so much of this criticism is the lack of understanding by people outside the security field.
it's good for those who want to maintain control over the public and bad for everyone else.
and arguably, tsa is making us less safe by focusing on fake id's, shampoo and toothpaste and letting things like bombs and guns thru.
what's really funny (not) is that you claim you're not preventing anyone from flying, you're only preventing them from entering the sterile area.
when the tso i encounter is courteous, polite, and professional in behavior, i will recognize them as being deserving of respect.
they have ruled that we cannot set up roadblocks and checkpoints to stop everyone who passes just to catch the few who have done something wrong, or to find the few who are suspected of intending to do something wrong.
june 17, 2008 10:08 am the process will never be "good enough".
carry and show your id and u will not have any problem with this policy.
it's insulting to the american people that you use college kids with fake ids as justification for a "regulation or security directive must be issued immediately in order to protect transportation security."
last week we announced on our web site a plan to begin requiring id from travelers on june 21st.
so, after 9/11 i had to remove all my pointy objects that used to be ok.
very romantic notion, but showing id to a screener is far, far, far from losing an "essential liberty".
i neither caused trouble nor slowed things down for other travelers when i asserted my right to travel without checking in with the government by identifying myself; i was taken out of line to be screened along with other "selectees".
you're going to punish patriots for standing up for their rights.
translation: the court did not bother researching the question pertaining to the nessecity of air travel.
when i see security guards in airports wearing what look like police uniforms and demanding identification, and police on our streets wearing what look like military uniforms, driving dhs-grant-funded armored vehicles, marching in riot gear with machine guns, pepper-spraying and tasing peaceful demonstrators, it makes me feel like i live in what is approaching a totalitarian state.
the port authority police department released the passenger after issuing a summons to appear.
at least try to give the id program a good spin by saying that you are trying to catch criminal alien id thieves.
in affirming the district court’s dismissal pursuant to rule 12(b)(6), we concluded that “by denying miller a single mode of transportation—in a car driven by himself—the dmv did not unconstitutionally impede miller’s right to interstate travel.”
if tsa is indeed intent on solving this loophole, the security checkpoint must be tied-in to the no-fly list and the airline reservation system.
by this fouled up reasoning the authorities could in all constitutional righteousness deny you every form of travel except walking.
" generally, yes, although many things can be used as a weapon (e.g., a plastic knife, a door handle torn from the lavatory, or bare hands) by anyone who wishes to use them as such.
starting june 21, that person could be subjected to a range of options, including interviews with behavior detection officers and local and/or federal law enforcement, enhanced pat-downs or other options.
in several foreing airports, there is an initial security screening done at the beginning of the secure zone as it is currently done in us airports.
"the problem is that it is unverified passenger names that get checked against the no-fly list.
moreover, the identification policy’s “burden” is not unreasonable.
so be grateful, is it so hard to be at the airport a couple hours early, and go through extra measures of security to ensure your families safety!!.
oh and remind matt i am still waiting for the section of law that limits the amount of real estate the tsa can place under its control at the airports.
we've wasted more money and life standing in these ridiculous lines and being subject to tsa's stupidity than we lost on 9/11.
just an observation: i once spoke with a passenger who was designated as a selectee (or, as some people put it, "singled out for harassssment") who was... hm - quite upset with the fact.
she just gets extra hastle, can't print a boarding pass at home, or check-in electronically.
when the tso checking my id can properly recognize my id as being valid without asking me what it is, i will recognize them as being properly trained and deserving of respect.
june 16, 2008 7:51 pm the trouble with so much of this criticism is the lack of understanding by people outside the security field.
every american knows this, and so does tsa, and so do the poor wretches tasked to lie to the american public via this blog.
if the agencies under his control are any indication of the man, he is poorly qualified for the task at hand.
so with kippie's latest id farce, he's essentially trying to quash dissidence.
even if we could prune the list so that it included only people who actually pose a "known" threat, potential terrorists could probe the system by sending people on innocent trips, observing which ones were subjected to additional screening, then later sending the other people on a real terrorist mission.
[13] in davis, an airline employee searched the defendant’s briefcase as part of the airport’s preboarding screening procedure.
on the fourth day, we're still checking the boarding pass at both locations.
but if you just lie, say you lost your id and then answer some questions (which you may have to answer even if you do have your id), then you'll be allowed on board.
there is no difference in security, only in your willingness to express an opinion the tsa doesn't like.
we could argue that with the war on terror that we've spilled more american blood and wasted more money than the terrorists have cost us.
he'd have to be one tough terrorist to do it with his bare hands.
june 13, 2008 2:10 pm maybe this id rule is a make-work program for the bdos: if they can pick out liars on the id issue they can score more 'wins' in their job performance statistics.
cargo is still unsecured, screeners fail to find test bombs 70% of the time, and theft of passenger items run rampant.
june 11, 2008 8:27 pm ensuring that people on the no-fly list don’t get on board is as important as using the metal detector.
if you are trying to catch terrorists, this is another*false alarm*.
if, and only if they went back to making sure bad stuff doesn't get on board the planes, then i would shut up.
on a recent flight, my husband and i went through security separately.
if you don't and simply rant for rant's sake, i'll see you in the sterile area with your pocket constitution and valid government issued id.
that is what will happen to the tsa if they continue to push this unconstitutional restriction of travel.
june 12, 2008 6:37 am after getting ssss boarding passes 15 times in a row, i have come to the sad conclusion that my name must be on a "watch list".
beat you to it, we're blaming the tsa for not doing their job because they are not doing their job.
it's hard because all the extra hassle is show and does nothing to enhance security!
sorry, tsa, you fail the straight-face test on this one.
history books say america won, but it looks like the tsa is intent on adopting the same kind of means of control that were favored by the nazis and the soviets who were on the losing side of history.
" very romantic notion, but showing id to a screener is far, far, far from losing an "essential liberty".
what tsa is really asking us to do is to present our credentials so that they can identify us.
before you go "ah ha", the single mode of transportation denied miller was his driving a vehicle because he refused to give his ss number to the dmv.
then in was shoes, then it was fingerprinting and photographing, then nail clippers (now back), then no fly and "suspicious" persons lists then liquid limitations, then having to take hooded sweatshirts off (beware! unwritten rule!), then transit visas, then puffers, then virtual strip search machines, and now id or psycho super screener grilling you guantanamo style (better described as id "or else").
the identification policy requires that airline passengers either present identificationor be subjected to a more extensive search.
i have been working on this post for two days, i was trying to be fair, and just present the facts.
don't forget this little tidbit of authority taken directly from tsa.gov: under the law that created tsa, the aviation and transportation security act, the tsa administrator is responsible for overseeing aviation security (p.l. 107-71) and has the authority to establish security procedures at airports (49 c.f.r. § 1540.107).
as you know when the blame starts getting passed around the ones on the bottom will take the most heat.
airlines love it: tickets cannot be resold; tsa loves it: they can now boast for catching false ids used by under-aged.
i am the person that on more than one occasion have told a police officer they need to settle down and stop yelling.
then they turned up the sensitivity on those devices and even my belt buckle set off the metal detector, so now i have to take off my belt.
people already have debunked that myth on here so i'm not going into it again.
tsa also checks to see if the id is authentic and that person imitating a no-fly list person would have a fake id then.
the tsa doesn't become involved unless the behavior is shown in the checkpoint, but it's not just what you are carrying but who you are and how you behave that matters when traveling by air.
under the new rule showing id is a requirement to be granted access to the sterile area.
the next flight you are on just might be the last if you complainers get your way.
there are so many ways that terrorists can get past this new plan requiring valid idenfitication to travel.
the honest people wouldn't be going anywhere.
even j. edgar hoover said in his study of communism that that communist governments require internal passports for traveling.
a rich man can choose to drive a limousine; a poor man may have to walk.
you wrote, "this plan includes enabling our officers to refuse entry into the area beyond the security checkpoint anyone that does not cooperate with us to establish his or her identity.
june 12, 2008 11:23 pm the people who want to hurt us will always find a way around it.
whenever the tso asks for my id i will hand the pocket constitution to the tso.
then they got word from the british that our beverages are threats to security, so we all had to reduce the liquids that we carry on.
when i did (in the 1980s), we were taught that a key difference between the usa and the ussr and eastern bloc was that we didn't have to have permission from the government for domestic travel, and didn't have to show id papers on demand.
so while the undercover officers observe me as i walk through the airport, investigators would be pulling up video of me from airport cameras and as much other information that they could find.
although we recognized the fundamental right to interstate travel, we also acknowledged that “burdens on a single mode of transportation do not implicate the right to interstate travel.”
the only time one is checked against the no fly list is by the airline when tickets are purchased.
as for your "by increasing our options, people with bad intentions don’t know what exactly to plan against," justification, you really do seem to be going for the keystone-cops terrorist detection plan.
note the "moreover, the identification policy’s “burden” is not unreasonable."
she did not indicate that tsa would fix the problem, but did confirm that if a traveler is "unwilling or unable to produce a valid form of id, the traveler is required to undergo additional screening at the checkpoint to gain access to the secured area of the airport."
" tsa's job is to ensure transportation safety, not to catch criminals.
put on the list by unidentified government officials, they can't get off.
the old story of the airline contractor not even looking up at a person while checking ids is long in the rear view mirror.
if we were truly serious about transportation safety, we would be better off putting all the tsa personnel to work fixing bridges and roads: a 10% improvement in road safety would save4200 lives per year june 18, 2008 11:23 am i think the majority of you making your comments in here need to stop wining.
later, when i get to the gate, i present to the gate staff my real boarding pass issued to john cleanname so that my boarding pass matches their passenger manifest.
i am the person that will not allow a police officer to review the images on my camera.
however that is exactly what does not happen in the overwhelming majority of cases where a person with a name on the watch list or no-fly lists attempts to travel and does not attempt to "circumvent the watch list".
some remember but were sofrightened by a horrendous crime (one that clearlycould have been avoided) that they have since sat by idly while our constitution is being subverted in the name of keeping us safe from anoverblown threat that is likely to be no more dangerous to the average person than was communism during the cold war.
although we do not question this allegation for purposes of this petition, it does not follow that defendants violated his right to travel, given that other forms of travel remain possible.
they are originally from bangladesh and are here for the freedom and opportunity.
also, our partners in the law enforcement and intelligence communities work tirelessly to identify potential threats to aircraft.

, gilmore does not possess a fundamental right to travel by airplane even though it is the most convenient mode of travel for him.
never mind that the no-fly-list has been shown to not be an accurate list of "threats" to aviation.
i'd love for tsa to explain just how many 9/11 hijackers this policy would have caught.
no secret motives, no hidden agendas, just a security enhancement aimed at people trying to game the system.
(the above is from 2theadvocate.com) louisiana, as did arizona recently, is moving to reject real id.
the no fly list doesn't contain names of the most dangerous terrorists because the government doesn't want to tip them off that we're on to them.
i'll give you a hint: tsa has to trot success of busting college kids with fake id's to look like it's doing something.
passengers that fail to comply with security procedures may be prohibited from entering the secure area of airports to catch their flight (49 c.f.r. § 1540.105(a)(2).
i fear that if we accept this at airports, we'll soon be accepting it elsewhere.
this is pure & simple retaliation by a cabinet member with no regard for the constitution he swore to protect and serve.
and on the miniscule chance that tsa actually does notice a real terrorist with one of these checks, they will likely treat them the same way as they do with the other 99.9999% of false positives.
it's how a government bureaucracy justifies it's existence.
in sum, by requiring gilmore to comply with the identification policy, defendants did not violate his right to travel.
if this is your best example of how document checking keeps us safe, tsa is hopeless.
this new requirement is meant for the person that simply won’t produce id nor work with us to determine that they’re not someone that poses a threat to that flight.
anyone who is serious about blowing a plane out of the sky is going to have the means to obtain either a legitimate id from the states or will be provided with a legitimate passport from a foreign country.
until then, they will be politely instructed on how not to break things.
i've always tried to respect your side, tsa...but in this instance, you've gone too far, creating a "papers please" environment (even though it may not be intentional), and it's not necesssary nor is it american.
because of this they are a danger to the flight and are denied boarding.
june 15, 2008 12:23 pm sandra said... need to apologize for my somewhat disorganized post on bob's "big catch" addendum.
as you may have noticed on the other page, i have been looking into the gilmore case.
additionally, the terrorists from 9/11 were in the country legally and had valid ids (see: open a newspaper), and were these "laws" in place on september 11th, 2001, those planes would have still been hijacked.
i resent having to pay to have my rights trampled by tsos who make up rules on the spot and having to pay for bureaucrats to imagine new ways to remove what is left of my constituional rights.
hopefully you will notice above what the tsa is refusing to acknowledge.
those of us who wish to do so will need to convince agents at government checkpoints that our credentials were simply misplaced, not withheld on principle.
hopefully, they will eventually get it a pace that will work...
my doing so doesn't make me feel any safer.
the id checker does not have a copy.
am msc said: "i think that if you had truly good security it should not matter who flies.
a tsa travel document checker noticed a passenger trying to use a fraudulent new york driver’s license and notified the port authority police department who came and interviewed her.
there was no science to prove that x-rays can't see through fabric, but we still had to follow the rule.
while the old policy (just ssss'ing them, giving them a pat down) is admittedly pretty easy and non-intrusive, it's what makes sense.
this initiative is simply a way for us to better enforce the no-fly list and ensure the safety of the traveling public.
no one is saying that we shouldn't have security.
before june 21st, 2008 the id check was not a requirement to be granted access to a sterile area.
he might have a 'deep understanding of terrorist' but he lacks management skills.
this country was founded by people who were previously living under a government that abused its power.
now, passengers are still not required to present credentials, but are required to assist with identification.
this is just to get the public used to one more "requirement" to fly, so that the next round of requirements will come easier.
we reject gilmore’s right to travel argument because the constitution does not guarantee the right to travel by any particular form of transportation.
lack of options and a punitive nature makes the new id order a burden that unduly restricts travel.
according to this, under some circumstances passengers who have not shown idwill be granted access to the sterile area.
best we can tell, plenty of innocent people are on your blacklist.
the test case needs to happen where air travel is the only real choice of travel.
you tried to impress us by quoting a single law and a cfr that implements it.
besides that, i still do not understand how getting a boarding pass marked ssss then being allowed to wonder freely within the airport before subjecting to harassssment improves security.
the more extensive search is similar to searches that we have determined were reasonable and “consistent with a full recognition of appellant’s constitutional right to travel.”
if you have to dip this deep into the barrel to find something to crow about, it says a great deal about how deep you have to troll in order to find something to crow about.
yes, you have caught numerous criminals, but none caught, would have caused a "security" problem on an airplane.
the agency was unable to do the simple task of moving supplies from point a to point b. tsa, an agency under the control of michael chertoff, absolutely fails at its given task.
am "this initiative is simply a way for us to better enforce the no-fly list and ensure the safety of the traveling public.
trollkiller, rather than "lighthearted" threads there should be a general notice to the effect that comments will take longer to get posted for a while because bob needs some rest.
to counter this, dhs must then escalate and put all airline gate staff through the same law enforcement/tsa training to spot fake credentials.
more security theater.
june 12, 2008 12:56 pm to just change the name on the boarding pass and have an id match that would not work 100%.
now, her picture drivers license id does not match her ticket name.
prior to june 21, 2008, passengers were required neither to present credentials nor to assist government agents at the checkpoint with determining identity of the passengers.
the more rights that are taken away from average people, the worse things will get.
you need to train your agents to say "papers please" when they ask for id, because that's what this is.
this just creates an additional, unnecessary dragnet and will consume people's time...all for nothing.
they are actively drifting their mission while not doing a good job of their primary mission.
nice guys but try to steal from them and they take it personally.
the pennsylvania woman who was supposedly kidnapped, but actually in disney world used a coworkers id to buy a plane ticket and travel to florida.
i can't help but wonder how dhs/tsa hired all the out of work communist from the old ussr!
when the terrorists attack again, i will hold tsa accountable.
it works for law enforcement.
by the way, you wanted to know how one can fly without entering the sterile area?

the london plotters were going to use items that weren’t on the prohibited item list at the time but would have blown up 7 airliners over the atlantic.
we haven't allowed the terrorist to erode any of our freedoms, it is our own government that has accomplished that task.
homeland security secretary chertoff has a deep understanding of terrorists.
unless the tsa agent is able to clear my id against the no-fly list at that point, the system does not work as intended.
i do not fit in: made all reservations myself, well in advance, round trips.
at that point, we're back to the detection of dangerous items in baggage.
unless tsa boarding pass/id checkers at the security checkpoint are tied in to the no-fly list, the system can still be gamed, in the same manner as originally publicized by the graduate student who authored the diy boarding pass website.
until then, they are playing with equipment they don't know how to use and their supervisors shall notified of the need for retraining.
btw, all of these bloggers claiming they'll never show the id to the tso.
on the third day, we're still checking the boarding pass at both locations.
the problem is that id doesn’t equal security.
before anybody gets all bunched up, yes the names of the guys that work the convenience store by my house are really named ali and muhammad.
so it boils down to this: if you want to travel anonymously or heaven forbid, protest the ever increasing silliness perpetrated by the tsa, you can't fly.
second, and most importantly, "to second guess the agencies under his control" is not "foolish" -- it's american!
thank you tsa for keeping ft lauderdale safe from spring breakers with fake id's.
meanwhile, this blog, created to foster dialog between us and you is just another venue for you guys to show how poorly you understand the business you're in.
that and the fact that no one is allowed to see the "g-rated" mmw images.
this man knows the depth of the threat.
you sure won't be when you bump into a petty bureaucrat who reads the poorly worded regulations differently than anyone else.
so, it seems that prisoners at gitmo have more rights than some poor schmuck trying to get on an airplane.
the district court correctly decided that it was an indirect carrier.
adding still more unnecessary distractions can only further endanger the aircraft and passengers.
people making up these ineffectual rules should be fired for incompetence and sent back to civics class to understand what makes (er, used to make) america such a great place to live.
this plan includes enabling our officers to refuse entry into the area beyond the security checkpoint to anyone who does not cooperate with us to establish his or her identity.
concentrated h2o2 is detectable.

again chill out!...if it's such a problem please don't fly!!
i have tolerated tso's up till now but will not do so any longer.
[12] like the plaintiff in miller, gilmore does not possess a fundamental right to travel by airplane even though it is the most convenient mode of travel for him.
hats off to chertoff and hawley for bringing about a stasi like environment.
i fly for business reasons.
june 12, 2008 2:39 pm oops, i accidently put my id in my checked luggage with my 4-oz can of cheeze-whiz.
doesn't exactly instill confidence to have a trained person assume that some passports are issued without a photograph.
on average anyway, there are tsa folks who look more closely but many seem to give the id side of things just a cursory inspection at most.
my id matches my boarding pass, and the tsa agent would wave me through.
denial of access is now punitive in nature due to the fact the passenger is required to genuflect in order to be allowed a secondary screening instead of the presentation of an id.
first computers had to come out of bags.
in my humble opinion this present id requirment is a crime and will be dealt with in due course.
the system is based on the faulty notion that the feds have this master list of terrorists, and all we have to do is keep the people on the list off the planes.
reading the court decision that will bolster this new id requirement and the asinine reasoning the 9th circuit used to back their ruling is about to make my head explode.
i'd rather have tsa be able to throw in congress's face that they did security right with risk based policies and there was nothing they could have done to prevent it rather than put on the dog and pony show that they do now to try to put on the illusion of security when the facts show that our checkpoints leak like a sieve and other vulnerabilities are left wide open.
from the gilmore vs. gonzales (previously ashcroft) although we recognized the fundamental right to interstate travel, we also acknowledged that “burdens on a single mode of transportation do not implicate the right to interstate travel.”
it's relatively easy to get a fake id, and regardless of how much technology we put into id cards, a criminal will be able to purchase a fake one or steal someone else's identity and get a real id with his picture and the other person's name.
tsa is full of pointy-haired management geniuses: actual enforcement of this new rule might increase their sham terrorist detection metrics, but as bruce schneier noted, it is all about control:"that's right; people who refuse to show id on principle will not be allowed to fly, but people who claim to have lost their id will.
and if you guys at the tsa don't see the logical fallacies in your id policy, you really ought not to be in charge of anyone's safety.
theory #3: perhaps incompetent leaders couldn't buy a clue if they were available.
i do, especially with this behavior detection stuff going on.
the point here is that id checks do not catch terrorists.
not questioning an out of control agency, managemnt, policies, etc results in the current trampling of our consitutional rights.
by requiring the equivalent of an oral id, the ninth circuit might not see it the same way this time.
even though the above ruling strengthened thereasonableness of having the option to show id or submitting to a secondary screen, it did not weaken the right of all citizens to be “free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this movement.
the exclusive reason to do this is to ensure people are who they say they are and are not gaming the system by using a boarding pass with a fake name; a well-known endeavor of professionals andcollege kids alike that could potentially circumvent the no-fly list.
my concern is that a requirement to show id would allow the government to monitor and restrict our travel.
if you dont have one, then just go to the bmv and get a state id card ( u need one to get a ticket at the counter or ligitimitly drive to the airport anyway)
if i will not grovel for a law enforcement officer, judge or boss, you can rest assured i will not grovel for a tin star security guard.
i don't care who the person next to me says they are.
"you cannot fly if you say "i don't have id because i don't think i should have to show it to you".
anonymous travel is a right in this country.
thanks for posting the subject though, i'm sure you'll get quite the response.
[tsa blog guy]christopher said: "actually, it’s an effort to keep people that pose a threat to aviation off airplanes and keep you, your family and mine safe."
you really mean to advocate searching exclusively for pointy objects and not individuals that may pose a threat?" i believe that it is ridiculous for you to allow thousands of security guards to determine on-the-spot whether someone "may pose a threat" based on anything besides whether or not that that person is carrying a dangerous item onto a flight.
in other words, the state of california has the common sense to recognize that it's your behavior, not your name, that counts.
upon meeting up at the gate, we realized that we each had gone through security with the others boarding pass.
our officers are very adept at finding fake documents and work closely with behavior detection officers on a daily basis.
june 11, 2008 11:35 pm um, the passenger controls the lock (the boarding pass) and the key (the id).
all such administrative requirements from the tsa are very much like what the nazis and soviets did, the very things that our parents and grandparents in uniform fought against in the second world war and during the cold war: "your papers!", government permission to travel domestically, etc.
i understand the argument that the 911 terrorists had real ids.
"this gaping security hole would bother me more if the very idea of a no-fly list weren't so ineffective.
however, they've actually had a squeaky clean accomplice make the flight reservations, so when the board the airplane they use their real boarding pass.
message to the government: follow the constitution, stop trying to be a nanny, and obey what the founding fathers wanted this country to be.
you don't make the rules but you did take an oath to defend the constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
i keep it in the car with my registration and proof of insurance.
if a terrorist has no weapons that can be used, then there’s no way that the terrorist can harm the passengers or the aircraft.
let's not set ourselves up for more of that which many of our ancestors fought to escape simply becuase some of us were sofrightened by a horrendous crime (one that clearly could have been avoided) that they have since sat by idly while our constitution is being subverted in the name of keeping us safe from anoverblown threat that is likely to be no more dangerous to the average person than wascommunism during the cold war.
i work at lax and passengers always act surprised like they don't know the process.
if foundation documents are not enough to convince you of the right to travel validity maybe the latest legal brick will.
if they're so innocent, put them out in public.
instead they've become distracted and lost what focus they may have ever had in the first place.
then 100 times out of 100 a document checking success lead to no terrorists being caught.
gilmore can not possess a drivers license for medical reasons, though arguably could possess other government id.
you're definitely getting a stiff-armed salute and the appropriate response in german (“jawhol, mein herr!”), if i ever am forced to stoop to air travel by a family emergency (which is the only thing that would ever get me to put up with your agency's violations).
even abraham lincoln said that's how american would destroy itself ... from the inside.
the most important aspect of the gilmore case is gilmore refused to show his id to the airline employees.
i made trip reservations for the family using her maiden name.
i really do need to forfeit all of my rights as a citizen.
in summary, the tsa has no right to demand an id and restrict the travel of free citizens that refuse to capitulate.
june 11, 2008 10:33 pm actually, it’s an effort to keep people that pose a threat to aviation off airplanes and keep you, your family and mine safe.
last week we announced on our web site a plan to begin requiring id from travelers on june 21st.
once the police comes and interviews you, watch how submissive you'll become.
oh well - at least your disgusting unconstitutional efforts are discouraging ever-larger numbers of passengers from flying, so there are fewer people to suffer the results of your failures.
by this, odds of someone that tsa catches by fake id being an actual terrorist is less than 1% and the odds that tsa is wasting time is nearly 100%.
after all denying you a mode of transportation does not equal denial freedom of travel.
we are screening for weapons as well as those intending evil to the plane and/or passengers and crew of the plane.
the exclusive reason to do this is to ensure people are who they say they are and are not gaming the system by using a boarding pass in a fake name; a well-known endeavor of professionals and college kids alike that could potentially circumvent the no-fly list."
i am that person that requires a police officer to have clear probable cause before allowing a search of my vehicle.
the tsa says that we have to show valid id to fly or we can't get in, even with a pat-down alternative.
ensuring that people on the no-fly list don’t get on board is as important as using the metal detector.
instead of allowing anyone without an id to show up, go through a quick pat down and bag check, circumventing watch list matching, we’re now opening up the options to include interviews with behavior detection officers and law enforcement; options no real terrorist is looking forward to and ones that legitimate passengers will find quicker and more convenient than today’s process.
at new york kennedy airport (jfk) on thursday, june 12, a passenger was interviewed by police after attempting to enter into a security checkpoint with a fraudulent id.
as trollkiller said: "anonymous said... you can all thank, with weepy eyes, activist john gilmore who took the u.s. government to court in 2004 over showing id to fly.
it seems the tsa wants to be hated.
he told me that a third-party arranged the travel plans, and issued them to his company.
you're comparing the boarding pass to the id, both of which are being handed to you by the passenger you're allegedly checking.
i think that if you had truly good security it should not matter who flies.
first and be very clear on this, what lost gilmore his case were these facts.
none of them is described as having been found to be carrying anything that, had he brought it onto his flight, would have put other passengers or crew at risk.
obviously not because she was allowed to go on her way.
i a lot more afraid of having my rights violated by some ego-inflated tso than i am about my plane being hijacked.
"ensuring that people on the no-fly list don’t get on board is as important as using the metal detector.
june 12, 2008 5:12 am "this initiative is simply a way for us to better enforce the no-fly list" the no fly list can easily be gamed using valid id.
prohibit dangerous items from being taken on airplanes, don't worry about peoples names.
the tsa screeners did not notice that the id presented did not match the names on the boarding passes!
why don't they arrest people who are "threat to aviation."
2) he had the option to take a secondary screening instead of showing his id.
the cia, nsa, fbi, military, etc do much more to protect us than tsa would ever be able to do in 20 lifetimes.
the cards we typically refer to as "ids" are not an identifications (which doesn't even make sense), they are credentials -- things that are used in the process of identification.
if the name on your ticket doesn't exactly match the name on your id (e.g., bob v. robert), you can be forced to purchase a new ticket.
the 9th circus also ruled that his travel was not restricted because he did not prove to them that the same id requirement was in place for buses or trains.
"as an avid flier, i want to make sure that the john doe sitting next to me is really john doe."
your agents may be trained to recognize fake ids, but what about fake boarding passes?
is has inconvenienced hundreds if not thousands of innocent people from legitimate travel because of a near match on a name.
you are absolutely right, showing an id to a screener is not losing an essential liberty.
the case also hinges on the fact he could leave instead of being searched.
the plaintiff alleged that this policy violated his fundamental right to interstate travel and his right to freely exercise his religion.
even worse, the whole concept of matching passenger names against a list of bad guys has negligible security value.
we are destroying our country from the inside by constantly trading freedom for "security."
the persons regulated are carriers.
at the gate, use the real boarding pass in the fake name to board your flight.
i take the liberty of offering the words of one who has read, researched, reasoned and conributed to the discussion here.
learn from what other countries have done.
no secret motives, no hidden agendas, just a security enhancement aimed at people trying to game the system.
government agents requiring people to show id before boarding a flight wouldn't make air travel any safer.
in fact, your system will allow a criminal organization to probe your system by sending people on innocent trips, noting which ones are flagged for additional screening, then send the other people on a real mission later.
bs having a name on a piece of plastic match a name on a piece of paper doesn't improve security and takes time away from processes that might.
you can't do it and neither can the id checkers, other than checking for an ssss.
the undercover inspectors continue to get guns and explosives past the tsa, but every year my hassle increases.
what tsa isn't doing is security, it's fear mongering.
as well, as you said, others need to pick up the slack.
in the gilmore case the court ruled gilmore's rights were not violated because gilmore had the option of a secondary screening.
it catches innocents such as ted kennedy, whose name is similar to someone's on the list, and islam yusuf (formerly cat stevens), who was on the list but no one knew why.
id's have been checked since the tsa took over and people without boarding passes couldn't go through.
he only had to present it to an airline employee/contractor.
anyone with sufficient determination will acquire a fake id or steal someone else's identity and get a real id with that person's identity and his own photograph.
" money can buy anything, absolutely anything.
so the check does help the no-fly list not get gamed.
big screen tv watching cnn.
and finally: this initiative is simply a way for us to better enforce the no-fly list and ensure the safety of the traveling public.
i haven't flown into or out of the states for about a year now, and i'm not going to fly again until at least the moronic 3-1-1 rules are rescinded or you stop dumping our dangerous and explosive shampoo in public trash bins.
there aren't that many terrorists out there; if there were, we would be feeling their effects.
people won't appreciate being interviewed by police if they forgot their id - they'll feel like they did something wrong.
by the way, we don't have a secret agenda.
unfortunately, peoplehave forgotten that this country was founded by people who fled a government that severely abused its power, and that the protections that some of us are trying to stand up for were put in place to avoid having such a situation recur.
mr. miller is still free to ride in a car, bus, train, or plane.
the new rulewill require passengers not to be honest about any intention to travel without checking in with the federal government.
so lets hold them to high standards, but give them a chance to do their jobs.
june 12, 2008 1:43 pm which is exactly why i refuse to fly any more except in a dire emergency.
suppose 1 false id per 3 days is normal, and your document checkers found a hundred 'sucesses' like this one during the last year.
if i am entering a secure area and you want to search my vehicle, no problem as that is reasonable.
it's passengers that don't wanna go with the flow that miss their flights and then have the nerve to blame tso's like myself.
i noticed that sniffers could have detected the bombs.
stop complaining because people easily forget about what happened on 9/11 and after that tragic event.
you're responsible for ensuring the safety of people flying on planes--and safety means physical items.
until then, their skills are unsatisfactory and i shall notify their supervisors of the need for retraining.
the gilmore case hinges on the fact that he could fly without id if he allowed himself to be subject to a secondary screening.
"the no-fly list is a kafkaesque nightmare for the thousands of innocent americans who are harassed and detained every time they fly.
it has, however, stopped peaceful activists from getting to planned demonstrations and congressmen from flying home to meet with their constituents.
punishing us for asserting our rights, as tsa has stated intent to do beginning four days from now (making crystal clear that this is no longer about ensuring safety, but about exerting control), just sends us further down the path towards life under a totalitarian regime.
trying to use the case law they have admitted to as the basis for their new found foolishness, would be like me arguing the use of a take a penny, leave a penny cup at the convenience store gives me permission to stick my hand in the till.
june 11, 2008 6:29 pm while flying out of kansas city last year, i saw tsa signs at the airport stating that travelers must present government-issued photo identification.
