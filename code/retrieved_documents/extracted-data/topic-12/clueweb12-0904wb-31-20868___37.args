if that 'ground' acts negatively on the forward motion in any way then you reduce the effect of the thrust.

the wheels on an aircraft are just freewheeling at takeoff, with forward thrust provided by the engines but the traction and forward motion is still a component of the wheel/ground interaction.

this is no different to running on a treadmill.
in the case of an aircraft, the reaction of the engines is that of forward motion, against whatever medium it is stationary.
then i understood the point of the free spinning wheels, making it able to take off.
but the ground the aircraft is sitting on in this case is not stationary, its providing an exactly cancelling force pushing the aircraft back.

running is an activity where the wheels (your feet) propel the vehicle.
start the conveyor moving without the engines on.
just because the wheels are turning doesnt mean the aircraft is moving with them!

the wheels will spin at an infinite speed, but this will not push the aircraft back, the force of the engines will move the aircraft forward and it will eventually take off normally.
quoting joness0154 (reply 6): i guess you can say the thrust of the a/c is pushing against the air, and would therefore propel it forward, regardless if the conveyor belt was matching the speed of the wheels or not.
if the conveyor belt exactly cancelled out the motion of the wheels, then as others on this thread have said, there would be no air movement over the wings and thus no lift produced.

in reality, however... 631 keta: while there's a forward motion, the side speed also plays a role in the flow.
probably the longest thread on tech/ops till date.
think of how a tail wind affects an aircraft on takeoff - it reduces the lift produced by the wing and can prove to be costly as now you need to either go faster to lift off, or climb slower.
the aircraft will move.
this is no different to running on a treadmill.
no one said the thing is tied down.

the wheels don't drive the airplane.
the wheels are just along for the ride.
the thrust of the engines will push the aircraft forward, and the conveyor belt will rotate the wheels in the opposite direction.
whether the wind is blowing, or the engines pushing the plane forward, air is moving over the wings to provide lift.

if you secure the airplane to the ground such that the ground speed can't exceed 0mph, you can still take off.

an aircraft at takeoff is never going faster than the rotation speed of the wheels.
in the case of an aircraft, the reaction of the engines is that of forward motion, against whatever medium it is stationary.
the conveyor belt speed is set to cancel the speed of the wheels turning, not the forward movement of the aircraft.
the plane would not take off but for a reason i've not seen mentioned.

this is exactly, what, i believe, navymidn is trying to tell you.
however the thrust is provided, the actual motion is set against whatever the aircraft is sitting on at the time.
in a perfect world (since we dont know anything other than the question, we have to assume perfection), the plane will sit still because the wheels will freewheel backward.
jetlagged: iwok uses the word "treadmill" rather than "conveyor belt" which betrays his mindset about the effect it has on the aircraft.
in this case the plane would take off.

well its tricky and tied to the magical treadmill which is designed to rotate in the same rate but negative to the wheels.
highly unlikely, but i think the soviets tried it 765 russianjet: it's like being on a runnning machine - you're running but not going anywhere, which is also why you don't feel the wind in your face.
another would be to avoid having conveyor belt runways that move sideways at the same rate as the aircraft's moving forward 642 starlionblue: for those who can't see the picture, it's an aircraft carrier.
the wheel speed and conveyor speed can totally be neglected.
hence the plane cannot mov 602 jetlagged: because if you want to match the speeds they must have the same frame of reference, otherwise the whole thing is meaningless.
with this description, the a/c will not move relative to the surrounding.

at first i thought of it your way richard, but after thinking about it for a while and the physics side of things it will be possible for the aircraft to build speed.
but isnt going anywhere, it has to be in motion to develop lift.
if itslcy, good luck, but edwards air force base might just be long enough...
unfortunately, without the slick conveyor belt or the wind tunnel, the plane will not take off.
to say the conveyor belt matches th 781 iwok: unless the treadmill is somewhat slick of course.

yes, the boat would move.
the belt would not work as a break as it's just a substitue for the rwy.
the tests, animations and "science content" were very good.
there's a reason that most wind tunnels are closed loops.

assuming we are on earth, and friction is a factor, the wheels will never make forward movement.
that'll teach you 25 pmn: surely the conveyor belt wouldn't really make a difference.
i guess they could just close the airport.
see, everyone changes their mind people, whether the wheels spin or not, the plane will still move forward, because nothing is hindering it.
the no fly arguments are becoming even more circular than the conveyor belt.
but the ground the aircraft is sitting on in this case is not stationary, its providing an exactly cancelling force pushing the aircraft back.
no no no...this principal of flight only applies to military helicopters.
if that motion is retarded by the ground moving backward at the same speed as the forward motion, then you are never going to get air movement over the wing.

in my first post i said "equivilant" since the actual rpm will depend on the diameter of the wheel.

thinking on it more, you could take off with the "magic force" treadmill that keeps the groundspeed of the aircraft at 0.
by the airframe propelled by it's engines, moving forward in the still air.
because the wind is calm, we are assuming, the thrust from the engines will work against it, therefore propelling the plane forward in relation to the air.
the only way the aircraft does not fly is if there is a "magic force" to hold it stationary, 825 sovietjet: this is the key, an instantaneous reaction to a change in velocity of the tires would mean that the tires and conveyor would be playing "catch up" un 826 iwok: i still say there is a third option.
then, by your account, an aircraft would never fly.

that means the plane on the belt cannot move, except for the wheels.
until take off, the forward motion is a component of the wheel/ground interaction and since you are removing this component then the aircraft cannot go forward.
if the aircraft moves forward down the runway, the wheels rotate clockwise, ie backwards.
if the aircraft 191 jean leloup: nav20, the conveyor is not neutralising engine thrust.

mandala499 762 jetlagged: doesn't matter, in the scheme of things rolling friction is a low force compared to thrust and drag.
if the wings are generating enough lift, the plane will lift into the air.

put a tonka truck on a treadmill and turn it on.
the wheels are therefore turning at the appropriate revolutions for that speed.
absolutely the aircraft would take off as normally.
considering the man 946 starlionblue: combine that with rule 3 and it might just collapse the universe.
i didn't think the plane would be carried sideways by the belt, in which case, there would be a crosswind.
then i understood the point of the free spinning wheels, making it able to take off.
but if you're willing to go shady the entire episode is most likely available on torrent sites.
a plane does not have gears, the plane has wheels that are free-rolling.
but i believe the original mystery was if the belt matches the speed of the plane and not the speed of the wheels.
in that case, the front wheels would have a higher rotational speed than the rear wheels.

thus forward motion can be generated and thus also lift.
in order to take off friction between the tire and belt must be brok 52 slamclick: nonsense.
in this case, theres no air movement because the air is technically acting as a tail wind in exactly the same proportion as the forward motion of the aircraft.
sovietjet: damn and you guys missed the 2 year anniversary of this thread 814 evan767: i wonder how the hell mythbusters is going to have a conveyer belt big enough for this.
the plane is a bae harrier.
the conveyor belt speed is set to cancel the speed of the wheels turning, not the forward movement of the aircraft.

so, the speed of the wheels could be equivalent to, say, 100mph, but the airplane could actually be going 300mph, or have a 200mph relative wind.
if you look back in the posts, you will find i understood the question a lot sooner than you did, mister.
i first of all thought that the aeroplane would stand still.
if the force exterted backward on the aircraft is the same as the force exterted forward by the engines, then theres going to be no lift.
let me give you an example: three guys check into a 176 ralgha: no, this is discounting air friction.
all the treadmill can do is increase or decrease the rpm of the wheels.

if you secure the airplane to the ground such that the ground speed can't exceed 0mph, you can still take off.
so there will not be any air flowing over the wing thus no lift is produced.

kari was talking and i was distracted.
when i first read the original post i was convinced it would not move.
yes, when you exert a force greater than the opposite motion, of course it will move forward.

you still think the wheels are pushing the airplane.

put a tonka truck on a treadmill and turn it on.
the test was fine because it doesn't matter how instantaneously the belt matches the 901 hawk21m: any link to the clip?
the wheel is trying to turn because that is the only way it knows for moving forward.
my physics calculations show that it does take off......... 68

wh 573 starlionblue: they try that kind of stuff on a regular basis.
yeah, i suppose any aircraft with a thrust-to-weight ratio greater than 1.0 would be able to accomplish the full circle.
in that case every real scenario should have the plane taking off.

sorry but this is not slam's day to cut any slack.
when i first read the original post i was convinced it would not move.
surely a nuclear aircraft carrier has the power to install a treadmill that accelerates from zero to whatever in the 119 ralgha: no, they don't.
but a thrust to weight ratio of "just over"1 would only allow it to crawl up to the vertical.
no one said the engines aren't running.
but the engines are acting on the air, which is stationary, so the engines by newtons theory will still produce forward thrust, moving the aircraft forward relative to the air.
jamie even said h 905 flexo: that is very true and i believe also the reason why this thread got so many posts as people mix up theory and real world.
we know that vtire = vaircraft - vconveyor ass 821 jamincan: umm, if by violating the properties of math you mean making a stupid math error.

see it the other way ´round: your build a really big ventilator and place it in front of the a/c. you apply the brakes of the a/c and then turn on your very big ventilator producing a stable wind at 200 knots.
i think the mythbuster episode proves that a plane can indeed take off on a conveyor belt.

see, everyone changes their mind people, whether the wheels spin or not, the plane will still move forward, because nothing is hindering it.
but i doubt that the mythbusters have the sort of budget that would require.

it just shifts the vents of the pegasus engine and it flies away safely...regardless of conveyor belt.
well, they already did the "pigeons flying in a truck" myth.
index this topic is archived and can not be replied to any more.
aircraft generate lift from airspeed, not groundspeed.
the airplane will move forward.
you could stick a million jet engines behind the aircraft, but it must be moving forward to generate lift and if the conveyor belt cancels out that forward motion then the aircraft isnt going anywhere.
the tests, animations and "science content" were very good.
i 55 slamclick: because the only way the moving surface could affect the speed of the mass of the airplane is if the wheels were driving the plane.
the wheels and landing gear have one purpose, and one purpose only.
it allows a tab in ff to actually be embedded ie.
if the conveyor belt exactly cancelled out the motion of the wheels, then as others on this thread have said, there would be no air movement over the wings and thus no lift produced.
at first i thought of it your way richard, but after thinking about it for a while and the physics side of things it will be possible for the aircraft to build speed.

the wheels on an aircraft are just freewheeling at takeoff, with forward thrust provided by the engines but the traction and forward motion is still a component of the wheel/ground interaction.

having read what you actually said, it's clear that my initi 148 slamclick: the wheels don't drive the airplane.
the thrust of the engines will push the aircraft forward, and the conveyor belt will rotate the wheels in the opposite direction.
thus forward motion can be generated and thus also lift.
the thing is, if the conveyor exactly matched the speed of the wheels, the wheels would not turn, period.
they were flown off f 219 bond007: the only thing in this scenario that would stop the jet engine from moving the plane forward would be friction between the wheels and the conveyor.
if you held the brakes on ice, and firewalled the throttle, you would still move forward, even though your wheels are not.

767 david l: sorry, russianjet, but there are a few hundred posts above explaining why that is not the case with an airliner.
if you are doing engine runs on an aircraft, with the brakes on you can go to full power.
thrust acts in relation to the air, not anything on the ground.
in this case the plane would take off.
759 mandala499: iwok, the relevance of the treadmill and the hovercraft is only on the "resistance" offered by the wheel and the river in the case of the hovercraft.
even my puny little a-320 has fifty-four thousand pounds of thrust.
you are not grasping the fact that airplanes do not depend at all on the ground for propulsion or flight.
that is to keep the 122 ariis: it is sliding against the belt (although hovering).
no, they will not spin at higher rpm, read the assumption.
just because the wheels are turning doesnt mean the aircraft is moving with them!
just think of this that you have a tail wind that always matches the speed of the aircraft.
i was actually a physics major for 3 years.
it would be possible, but it would take a longer distance than a regular runway due to lack of friction.
this is a great thread; reminds me of that one about airplane filled with pigeons, the one someon 116 ariis : that is known as 'catapult', by the way.
that means the center of each axle is going 50 mph.
slamclick: that would only be true if the plane was driven through the wheels like a car.
its philospophical only if you assume that its a magic belt keeping the wheels stationary.
in option 1, the limiting factor would be the wheels rotating much faster than they were designed to do, not the mi 871 boeingonfinal: no, that is not why the thread is so long.
this will cancel out all forward motion, totally and utterly.
and read 32767 times: no, the plane will not takeoff.
however, given the question asked, until tracti 221 chksix: so if the tarmac refuses to budge, the aircraft can never start to taxi....
planes make lift by air moving over the wings.
in this case, theres no air movement because the air is technically acting as a tail wind in exactly the same proportion as the forward motion of the aircraft.
aircraft engines move air, so it doesn't matter how fast you spin 843 starlionblue: you're just trying to explain the laws of physics.
the plane would still accelerate, even though the wheels are not moving.
another would be to avoid having conveyor belt runways that move sideways at the same rate as the aircraft's moving forward 642 starlionblue: for those who can't see the picture, it's an aircraft carrier.
the wheels would simply spin faster and the plane would still take 913

in a 'realistic' setting ... i.e. real physics and no 'magic' ... the plan will fly, and it will gain airspeed.

people still jump on here believing that they could possibly offer an opinion or "facts" that have not already been considered, disputed, 676 jetlagged: oh, well, that settles it then.....
think of how a tail wind affects an aircraft on takeoff - it reduces the lift produced by the wing and can prove to be costly as now you need to either go faster to lift off, or climb slower.
all of you claiming it will work are overlooking one fairly major point: the thread starter said that the conveyor belt moved backwards to match the forward speed of the wheels at all times.
as slamclick has already indicated (i'm sure many more times than he would have liked to!), wheel rotation is not required to get for 225 leanofpeak: however, getting forward motion without wheel rotation requires that the traction of the tires be broken (now we're getting somewhere).
when it comes to high thrust 617 hawk21m: you are forgetting about relative airflow over the control surfaces.
904gregarious119: i gotta admit, i was pretty impressed with the conditions they made for the test - doesn't get much more straight forward then that.
the engines add an additional thrust component to the equation, which is not affected by the conveyor.
regds mel 590 david l: given that option 3 is not a real world scenario, i think it's fair to say the aircraft cannot move simply because of the wording of the problem.
wheels (dragged by the aircraft) move at 150 kts in one direction, the belt moves at 150 kts in the opposite direction - ground 124 a346dude: you just had to get that out, didn't you.

on a treadmill the place where your foot lands on the belt is constantl 109 ariis: no, they will not spin at higher rpm, read the assumption.
until take off, the forward motion is a component of the wheel/ground interaction and since you are removing this component then the aircraft cannot go forward.
then, by your account, an aircraft would never fly.
747 fredt: the only thing the conveyor belt can do is to impart a force on the tyre contact patch, in this context in the negative x direction (rearwards).
running is an activity where the wheels (your feet) propel the vehicle.

this is tricky because you'd get all sorts of relativistic effects trying to get to infinite speeds.

all of you claiming it will work are overlooking one fairly major point: the thread starter said that the conveyor belt moved backwards to match the forward speed of the wheels at all times.
if you are stationary on a conveyor belt, there is absolutely no wind moving over the wings, and hence no lift.

it does not affect the motion of the fuselage and wings at all.
imagine a plane is sat on the beginning of a massive conveyor belt/travelator type arrangement, as wide and as long as a runway, and intends to take off.
the friction between the wheels and conveyor belt is not even an issue since the tires are free to rotate.

an aircraft doesnt just leap into the air and its off.
the thing is, if the conveyor exactly matched the speed of the wheels, the wheels would not turn, period.

as the wheel rotates faster, it has more energy (e gets larger).
the reason for that is that the forward motion is not supplied by the wheels (like a car/train), but by the jet engines.

605 jetlagged: right, but you also said the belt would move (backwards) at the same speed as the relative speed between it and the wheels.
aircraft generate lift from airspeed, not groundspeed.
(reply 12): then, by your account, an aircraft would never fly.

i think just abou 187 sovietjet: how can the wheels spin faster than the belt though....if they are both equal the plane will never move no matter how much thrust(assuming no slippage 188
just for the record, i was considering the various speeds thus: ground speed = aircraft speed relative 608 darkblue: must... not... let... thread... die...
any aircraft taking off on skis shows it could be done with locked wheels on ice.
no no no...this principal of flight only applies to military helicopters.
in other forums when postings get to the 200 or so mark it goes to part 2 etc.
the airplane is moving forward just as normal, only the wheels are 170 turnit56n:
that would be nice, except that producing... ... which meets the op's requirements in matching instantaneously, not even allow 783 ralgha: iwok, you do not understand why the ops premise is impossible.
boat sails work on the principle of lift.
the aeroplane is travelling at 90 knots.
(i'll admit, i'm no physics expert, so it's a genuine question).
the aircraft will continue to move forward at takeoff speed, but the wheels may well be spinning at 1000+ mph.
yes, as slamclick pointed out, but the aircraft would still accelerate in the desired direction, which is really the point.
as the wheel rotates faster, it has more energy (e gets larger).
if i'm on a train that's crawling along at 5km/hr (relative to the ground) and i walk backwards at 5 km/hr (relative to the train), i 604 starlionblue : 602 posts later...
belt opposes aircraft's ground-speed, not its "belt-speed" ("classic" scenario) a2.
the aircraft will continue to move forward at takeoff speed, but the wheels may well be spinning at 1000+ mph.
ok, i don't care who sees this, who agrees, i'm sticking with this; it can not work!
this can be found on tons of forums across the internet, most of them not even aviation related.
894 a346dude: in this case, the instant the conveyor belt starts moving, the snakes will devour the thousands of pigeons inside the plane, which (as we all know) m 895 miller22: now that it took the mythbusters to teach us basic aerodynamics, can we please let this one die?
in reality, however... 631 keta: while there's a forward motion, the side speed also plays a role in the flow.
whichever way the experiment goes, the losing side will be arguing even more over the experimental technique, most obviously that 804 sovietjet: exactly, remember...the belt has to instantaneously match the speed of the wheels....not the airspeed of the plane.
normal helicopters don't fly either...they just beat the air into submissio 929 mqtmxguy: of course, they taught us that way back in amt101, how amature of me (stupid!stupid!stupid!)
it would be possible, but it would take a longer distance than a regular runway due to lack of friction.
sorry but this is not slam's day to cut any slack.
it would be like running across a runni 634 david l: if the runway heading is north, the aircraft will be thrusting itself northwards and the belt will be moving, let's say, eastwards.
after many tests, i have determined that either way the belt is turni 185 nav20: when you get to my age the oddest things stir memories of long ago.
regds mel 926 dabuzzard: just because the sidewall says 160 mph max speed does not mean it won't spin any faster, it's not like there are brakes inside the tire that apply wh 927 david l: well, i'm reminded of the mess i made in an earlier thread about birds flying inside an aircraft - not the one from a couple of years ago but one sho 928 tdscanuck:
however the thrust is provided, the actual motion is set against whatever the aircraft is sitting on at the time.
thegeek: on david l's possibility 3, the plane crashes due to all the tyres exploding.
it's slow loading for me, but no performance issues.
sovietjet: damn and you guys missed the 2 year anniversary of this thread 814 evan767: i wonder how the hell mythbusters is going to have a conveyer belt big enough for this.
the thread starter and fans of the "magic" belt might argue that discussion of 796 airfoilsguy: ok, after 795 posts i will let you in on a secret.
if you g 152 ralgha: if you factor in bearing friction, you could eventually get to a speed that would prevent the airplane from moving forward since the rotational frict 153 ralgha: i must disagree, i've tried to explain it to many "normal" people who were never convinced.
there are a few situations in which the wheels could be moving slower than the aircraft.
having read all the good points by all participants (includi 110 jean leloup: unfortunately, airplanes are not runners.
finally we have a visual proof don't quite understand what that scary* face is, though *replace with a more suitable ad 777 russianjet:
the conveyer belt is designed to exactly match the speed of the wheels at any given time, moving in the opposite direction of rotation.
what the op is suggesting c 906 jetlagged: the belt can go faster than the tyres and the aircraft will still take off (subject to the usual caveats about tyres overheating, etc).
aircraft engines move air, so it doesn't matter how fast you spin 843 starlionblue: you're just trying to explain the laws of physics.
regds mel 908 a346dude: the real answer is the plane will take off regardless of belt speed.
the a/c will not move an inch, and also not rotate as there is no airflow over the wings.
well, if i have one person who agrees, there is hope left for this world haha, very nice.
it's impossible for the belt to negate the movement; when the belt accelerates to catch the wheels' speed, the w 207 pihero: my two cents : 1/ aircraft/wheels/belt do not form a closed system as in the theory, the only force considered comes from the engine thrust, and we mi 208 cosmiccruiser: first let me say i should have stayed out of this.
additionally, i am an engineer by education, and i do get 154 ppvra: the wheels would freewheel backwards - cancelling the conveyor belt - even with the engines powered off.
until everyone grasps the simple truth that the airplane will take off unless something stops the motion of the center of the axl 133 david l: well, assuming you could find one that behaves, i think the shopping trolley analogy is a good one.
but i'm going on the 'terms of reference' as stated in the thread-starter:- so more thrust equals more 'speed' - 204 a346dude: it seems like just as everyone has agreed that the aircraft will take off, someone new enters and says it won't.
914 mqtmxguy: of course, the helicopter will still be ugly, thus the earth will still repel it.
the conveyor belt does not affect the plane's ability to do this.
regds mel 839 starlionblue: more likely until it becomes so massive that it causes the universe to implode on itself.
better 950 kelpkid: if the friction were high enough, the water within would eventually turn to steam, and then if it found the slightest weak point, you could have a st 951 vc-10:
657 deltaamtrak058: lift is generated by the wings, the engine just pulls it forward.
kay: hmm, i will throw in the following: since the belt is rotating at the same speed as the wheels, then, sorry, but yes, there is a force stopping the ai 42 nighthawk: in order to move forward the tires would need to skid forward along the conveyor belt, losing friction.
mandala499 762 jetlagged: doesn't matter, in the scheme of things rolling friction is a low force compared to thrust and drag.
the wheels will spin at an infinite speed, but this will not push the aircraft back, the force of the engines will move the aircraft forward and it will eventually take off normally.
unfortunately, without the slick conveyor belt or the wind tunnel, the plane will not take off.
if the aircraft moves forward down the runway, the wheels rotate clockwise, ie backwards.
so, in other words, if you're sticking to your guns about the conditions, the situat 217 nav20: i agree, bond007, that in real life the engines would move the aeroplane, the conveyor wouldn't be able to cope, and the wheels would skid until the 218 nav20: very little to do with the subject, slamclick, but i also recall him telling us about his squadron being sent to malta in 1941.
any aircraft taking off on skis shows it could be done with locked wheels on ice.
we assumed still air so airspeed would equal the aircraft's speed relative to the ground (not the conveyor belt).
after many tests, i have determined that either way the belt is turni 185 nav20: when you get to my age the oddest things stir memories of long ago.
794 kay: i think the problem posted by the op does not present alot of relevance physically.
and helicopter pilots will tell you the rotor remains stationary and the world
the aircraft will take off.
in the real world of aviation the axles are pulled forward by the rest of the plane.
181 ralgha: the friction is constant, the force imparted by that friction is dependent on the speed of the object.
it just shifts the vents of the pegasus engine and it flies away safely...regardless of conveyor belt.
the axle of the whee 735 wpiaeroguy: slamclick, you're incorporating velocity vectors and using the ground/runway as your frame of reference.
if you pull on the rope to make it go faster the conveyor will go faster in the opposite direction.
highly unlikely, but i think the soviets tried it 765 russianjet: it's like being on a runnning machine - you're running but not going anywhere, which is also why you don't feel the wind in your face.
unless the wheels slide down the belt, the aircraft will never take o 118 slamclick:
747 fredt: the only thing the conveyor belt can do is to impart a force on the tyre contact patch, in this context in the negative x direction (rearwards).
to the laws of physics gentlemen, the aircraft will be moving forward at take off speed, but since an opposite force is being exerted on the aircraft, it isnt actually going anywhere.
regds mel 839 starlionblue: more likely until it becomes so massive that it causes the universe to implode on itself.
you can acheive the same result by anchoring the wheels dow 716 airframeas: easy...if its off.
its all in what the conveyor belt is moving in relation to, and whether you measure the conveyor belt speed at the point of the 227 david l: assuming we're going with the "silly" version, i see the point about the wheels needing to rotate at half the speed i was thinking of (i.e. slipping) 228 kay: they will not spin as fast as you are saying, but only as a result of the wheel struts wanting to move forward, they will want to spin, but the turni 229 david l: the wheel strut is not in contact with the conveyor belt.
in order for the plane to reach takeoff speed it needs to over come the friction of the air and the tires and inertia.
as for my 'vote' (not that it's really up to popular decision, of course), the plane will definitely take of 66 slamclick: it is absolutely staggering!
additionally, i am an engineer by education, and i do get 154 ppvra: the wheels would freewheel backwards - cancelling the conveyor belt - even with the engines powered off.
it is because those who actually is competent enough to figure out this ridiculously easy question can't f 872 starlionblue: guilty!
absolutely the aircraft would take off as normally.
ok, seriously you have to assume that the wheelbearings are frictionless, have an infinite speed capacity, or simply admit that the plane taking off o 624 chksix: in your scenario, it will drive off the belt runway in a relative position 45 degrees from it's starting point and then keep on accelerating on the gr 625 david l: yes, that was assumed for option 1, where the wheels turn at twice the normal speed.
