think of how a tail wind affects an aircraft on takeoff - it reduces the lift produced by the wing and can prove to be costly as now you need to either go faster to lift off, or climb slower.as long as that air is calm, the thrust will propel the plane forward, which will produce airflow over the wings.the engines could be generating 100% thrust but if theres no forward motion because its cancelled out by the moving ground then the aircraft will never get into the air.the wheels will spin at an infinite speed, but this will not push the aircraft back, the force of the engines will move the aircraft forward and it will eventually take off normally.as this head wind is greater than the rotating speed of the aircraft, the wings will produce enough lift to let the a/c take off from the ground - but only as long as it is within the produced currents and the relative airspeed is maintained: this will require the a/c to be kept on a leash, making this a 100 ton-kite ...but the engines are acting on the air, which is stationary, so the engines by newtons theory will still produce forward thrust, moving the aircraft forward relative to the air.aircraft generate lift from airspeed, not groundspeed.the wheels on an aircraft are just freewheeling at takeoff, with forward thrust provided by the engines but the traction and forward motion is still a component of the wheel/ground interaction.the reason for that is that the forward motion is not supplied by the wheels (like a car/train), but by the jet engines.the thrust of the engines will push the aircraft forward, and the conveyor belt will rotate the wheels in the opposite direction.wheels have a limited speed range and after exceeding it they will explode eventually.there is no force counteracting the thrust of the aircraft, therefore, the thrust would propel the aircraft forward.so, the speed of the wheels could be equivalent to, say, 100mph, but the airplane could actually be going 300mph, or have a 200mph relative wind.in the case of an aircraft, the reaction of the engines is that of forward motion, against whatever medium it is stationary.aircraft are just big road vehicles until they move quick enough to generate lift.
