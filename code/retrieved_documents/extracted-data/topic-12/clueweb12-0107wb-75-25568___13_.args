the national health service, while it has its faults, will treat you free and unlike in canada, it also includes cheap dentistry - what about a checkup for the equivalent of 25 us dollars?the problem is, you leave your network behind when you move countries, so when you're looking for work you're effectively always making that "cold call", and if you're education and background are in another country employers feel they're taking more of a risk.even with the current cuts (more of that later) they subsidise far more theatre, art, concerts, museums than canada or the us.yes, it's a tiny place, but very picturesque and there are many footpaths with "the right to roam" - so you can walk over someone's land in the country.things like grocery shopping, doing laundry, getting from point a to point b - these things are far less convenient than in north america.you can visit many more interesting places on weekends - castles, stately homes, enormous numbers of museums and the countryside.i've known many british people who've gone to canada and been disappointed at the apparent lack of work, prospects and decent pay on offer.from what i've read, a lot of the quality of life enjoyed in north america pretty well goes out the window....i mean i would love to move there, but i don't want to risk it at the expense of what we have here, which is good job, nice weather and find out that it was a mistake and that it's not that great a life over there.just normal ordinary life is much more difficult, at least speaking from a london perspective it certainly is.perhaps a temporary stay in the uk would be fun, but not at the risk of losing what you currently have.like everyone says here, you need to make your own decisions, of course you do, no one can drag you over.i would like a little bit of a educated decision as i don't want to move there and regret it, and based on a lot of peoples experiences, it seems people for the most part are not happy.it's always good to visit the city and get a vibe from it (not everywhere is good for everyone).but you would be giving up what sounds like a good existence there, with a good quality of life and lots of positives going for you.
