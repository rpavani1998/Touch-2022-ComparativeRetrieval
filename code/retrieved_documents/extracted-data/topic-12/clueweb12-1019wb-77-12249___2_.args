the scheme will allow passengers to assess the environmental impact of their journey.it seems like an odd concept in the face of the uk’s current anti-flying hysteria, but picking the most environmentally friendly airline could be a way for consumers to engage with climate change while governments wrestle with tougher questions.while aviation retains its bad-boy image, at least one airline is dealing with the publics concerns about climate change it seems like an odd concept in the face of the uks current anti-flying hysteria, but picking the most environmentally friendly airline could be a way for consumers to engage with climate change while governments wrestle with tougher questions.passengers, the airline says, will then be in a position to decide, on an informed basis, whether they want to carbon-offset that journey.flybes self created eco-labelling scheme will be audited by deloitte, and will provide passengers with detailed but user-friendly breakdown of the fuel consumption, carbon emissions and noise patterns of the aircraft type to be used on their journey.water, transport, food, heating, and power are all going to be affected by climate change and its change agenda.flybe’s self created eco-labelling scheme will be audited by deloitte, and will provide passengers with “detailed but user-friendly breakdown of the fuel consumption, carbon emissions and noise patterns of the aircraft type to be used on their journey”.passengers, the airline says, “will then be in a position to decide, on an informed basis, whether they want to carbon-offset that journey”.for some environmentalists, flying will now never be socially acceptable.plane stupid retorts that airline emissions are two to four times more harmful to the environment at altitude, and that most flights are less than 500 kilometres in europe anyway, making the train a better option.governments and companies appear to be hoping that if we can get emissions down elsewhere, that will have to make up for it.however, in a low margin industry, where trade publications still refer to environmental myths, such as climate change, this seems to signify leadership.however, in a low margin industry, where trade publications still refer to environmental “myths”, such as climate change, this seems to signify leadership.the action by governments right now is focusing on the easy wins: pressuring business, for example, or pushing product carbon labelling."effective insulation in homes would get bigger gains, quicker, than fighting flying" the airline is also going to buy carbon offsets via pure, a non-profit carbon offsetter.
