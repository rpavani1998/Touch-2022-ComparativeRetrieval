teleconferencing, “skyping” and webinars are all great options for businesses looking to cut their carbon and their budget.some of the best options for work travel or family vacations can also be close to home.connecting flights are sure to increase the carbon footprint of flying.one of the more recent and detailed analyses i came across done by sightline institute actually found that the worst way to travel (for the planet) was by driving solo.if i want to fly from winnipeg to denver the carbon footprint will be significantly different whether i take a direct flight vs. connecting thru minneapolis, chicago, calgary, etc.more importantly, she makes use of recycled materials to create beautiful projects that are useful for the home.for flights, don’t forget to include the cost of taxis or buses to and from the airport (city buses are a very inexpensive option).one factor i don’t see mentioned which may affect the analysis of flying is whether you are taking a direct flight.when calculating your driving costs, don’t forget to factor in higher gas prices in other provinces (caa quotes an average of 130c/l nationally), wear and tear on your vehicle (budget about 5c/km for the average vehicle), and meals and hotels.if you’re planning on taking a train or bus, keep an eye on upcoming or last minute sales.an earlier report from the ipcc shows the complexity of variables at play.i won’t even begin to pretend that cycling 365 days a year is for everyone, but it could certainly be for more people.looking at peter’s question, i assume the first evaluation is in us gallons, as the organization is based in the u.s.i’d like to send out a big thank you to green action centre and the winnipeg community for being so welcoming to me and the rest of my katimavik group.i couldn’t take a close look at the factors involved in the evaluation done by sightline institute.
