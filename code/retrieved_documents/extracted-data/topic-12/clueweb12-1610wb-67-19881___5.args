the rib tops at about 30 mph, which is slower then the 2 stroke variants.
these unthinking people are behaving irresponsibly endangering the lives of innocent people both those in the speed boats but also that of other water users (ie fishermen & boaters) in their vicinity .

i have a big issue with age limits , three years ago or whenever it was perfectly legal for 15 year olds to drive this kit, suddenly its not, the issue isnt age its competence.
each boat had between 2-4 occupants, a receipe for a disaster and a subsequent clampdown in my view.
e.g. 6-ish metres with twin 150hp honda 4 stroke ( quite a heavy engine in itself )

information is provided by iwai in good faith.
website feedback, errors, corrections etc. are always welcome.
i witness on sunday , three very fast speedboats, with very loud and obviously powerful petrol engines, play "chicken" and endlessy circle and cut accross each other bows at high speed near the lakeside recently.
would specing the rib with a 30 or 20hp make me any more "responsible".
these posts likely contain out-of-date information.
if the operator is aware of the excessive power and uses it appropriately ok, but in a lot of cases these boats are pushed to the limit most of the time ( or until the operator has his/her near death experience )
i think it's irresponsible for someone to spec a craft like this.

i would argue that the examiner who issues the powerboat cert should be the decider, that person may feel a certain 12 year old has a better grasp of the issues then a 15 year old.

in many cases i suspect it would force many of the owners into having to obtain the necessary training.
and yes its on my davits, though let me tell you anyone with davits carrying 40hp enginess are in the minority.

the previous situation was that there was no lower age at all.
- buying a lifejacket - checking a lifejacket - repairing a lifejacket - boating code of conduct - boating education - certificate of competency - boat surveyors - iwai shop - waterside walks - keep the children happy - waterside restaurants - angling/fishing - nature - official - discussion forum - photo gallery - opinion polls - friends of the ulster canal + links to agencies, clubs etc.
the previous situation was that there was no lower age at all.
the rib tops at about 30 mph, which is slower then the 2 stroke variants.
you can go down to 3.5 hp and still plane some of these craft.

>>>surely better to facilitate training youngsters rather than pretend it >>>doesn't happen cause it's not allowed.
to a previous poster, mandatory insurance is not a way of improving standards, its merely a way of driving up the cost of insurance.
the mistake in my opinion was to overlook certification as a way around teh problem, rather then just a simple age mechanism.
the 'waterways ireland' patrol boat can not be everywhere but something must be done about this type of behaviour before its too late .
and yes its on my davits, though let me tell you anyone with davits carrying 40hp enginess are in the minority.
dave >>>as an owner of a 3.9metre rib with a 40hp yamaha, what exactly is "irresponsible".
it frightens me to see 3.5-ish ribs ( davit friendly ) powered by up to 40 hp outboards.

had life jackets on either - it's an accident waiting to happen only it will not be an accident - such an event implies the element of chance - being in the wrong place at the wrong time - this will not be the case in these situations it is reckless behaviour akin to dangerous driving .

registered: 4 years ago posts: 72 hi list, i wish to confirm dave's comments in this instance , last sunday there were indeed 4 not 3 speed boats in the inner lake between quigleys and portaneena playing chicken as he described it , c. 2.30-2.45 pm circling each other in a dangerous series of manouvres at speed,not only that some of the occupants were small children and not all of them had life jackets on either - it's an accident waiting to happen only it will not be an accident - such an event implies the element of chance - being in the wrong place at the wrong time - this will not be the case in these situations it is reckless behaviour akin to dangerous driving .
