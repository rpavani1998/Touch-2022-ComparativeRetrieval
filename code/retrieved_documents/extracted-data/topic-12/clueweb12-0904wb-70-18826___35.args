with a typical 3000-lb vehicle, the weight and cost of the battery is significant because you need a big expensive battery to haul around a lot of mass that really doesn’t add to the utility of the vehicle.
even with their drawbacks, i expect plug-in cars will find at least a small market, for a number of reasons that i will explain in this post.
i recognized that the plug-in was a less effective use of battery resources than a hybrid.
setting aside solutions other than personal automobiles, your analysis of various vehicle options is right on.
now my friend who lives in indiana and drives 50+ miles per day decided to go for a prius.
the cost problem with plug-in electric automobiles a major issue is the high front-end cost of plug-in electric autos.
i truly love france, but trying to manage a bike on a high speed train is not much fun.
he states that electric vehicles will use the same amount of energy per household as our refrigerators.
better batteries will be invented.
a canadian company recently found a big rare earth deposit in nebraska.
hi gail, in a perfect scenario (most doubtful) we would conserve high energy sources (liquid fuel or big batteries) just for those activities that really need them.
strange a blog called finite world wouldnt realize that cars, and the machinations of corporations and governments to keep them rolling along,are what are draining the world.
it sounds neat enough, but i am not sold on the idea.
countries cannot be expelled, but sovereign states could choose to secede.
i think your model of thinking, “zeroing out” trips could become a cultural phenomena for drivers of this (and like designed) vehicles.
the financial system is also likely to be affected.
the economic cost is, in many ways, the least of the concerns investors should have about a break-up.
compareing the cost of a pih@25.1 cents p/m, then saying an ‘efficent’ gas-burner comes in a 19.6 cents.
for those who find these suggestions unpalatable for economic reasons, personal reasons or what-have-you – then it would seem to be your responsibility to suggest how the laws of physics can be dealt with as oil depletes, the planet warms, the oceans acidity, deserts spread, aquifers deplete, species extinction rates increase, millions of humans starve in africa, human population grows, etc.
even small economy cars such as the nissan versa (122hp), the ford fiesta (120hp) and the chevrolet cruze (136hp) have engines as powerful as the base engines offered with the full-size gas-guzzlers of the 1950s such as the 1952 ford customline (110hp) and the 1954 chevrolet bel air (123hp).
i also appreciate the use of numbers (facts and figures) so much of the energy debate is assertions with no information content.
the real test would be whether the electrical system could be kept operating–if there would be enough spare parts.
us imports of petroleum products, based on eia data.
i agree that it is not likely that battery powered vehicles will create any significant in-roads if one assumes that the mass of current vehicles remains the same.
no matter how much they insult us for not getting in line and wasting our money on an image.
i’m not saying that peak oil won’t be a big crisis.
the leaf is of comparable weight to a base model and stripped down camry.
according to the wsj article high battery cost curbs electric cars . . .
for the home, you are going to have lots of small legacy solar, like d.lights and sunwize systems for a little bit of lighting, and then some standalone pv homes that will have electricity for decades during the day, but not at night (unless you can manufacture sulfuric acide and refurb batteries).
as with everything in this descent (or step function down for a true doomer), working towards “local” xyz, community sufficiency, and very reduced expectations on comfort (i wear a real coat, gloves and a hat driving it in the winter), is what we should be doing now for ourselves and to help other people make that transition.
it sounds neat enough, but i am not sold on the idea.
throughout the northeast there were plenty of manufacturers using water power to run machines in the 19th century, all of those sites still exist, i don’t even remember much of the tooling being steel, most seemed made of iron, but i could be wrong.
hi david, back in the good old days (maybe bad) when we jumped on a plane in blissful ignorance to go cycling in europe, we used trains in ireland and france.
he told me that after ww2, it was an even slower lifestyle.
what we need are trains that work as well as they did pre-ww2.
however, even if cars were made marginally …..cleaner, i cant bring myself to call them green, b/c that would be a lie, none of the other problems created by personal, private 1 person per 4000 pound metal and plastic box get resolved-not one.
the conventional body-on-frame construction is simpler to repair and to service, and parts probably cost less.
we will be poorer in the future than we are today, but we won’t disappear anytime soon.
there might be a nice integration there to deal with peak solar power during the day.
philip says: september 8, 2011 at 8:22 am chris i believe i’ve read that the additional charging and discharging would cause the batteries to wear out more quickly.
coal transport depends on oil.
they worked well enough.
minorities i know in the bay can’t stand prius drivers either.
no doubt some will want to argue that renault have got their sums wrong, but for customers the answers are in.
this actually a response to gail and “low energy”.
all that thanks to technologies which make a lot of personal meetings aspects obsolete).
for example (us centric): national max speed 35 mph with mandatory governors, elimination of half the public roadways, no new parking facilities, significant tax increases for private vehicle weight, etc.
this would be no different than inspecting the engine on a gasoline car before resale.
even the prius can carry over 800 pounds (though it is sold as a five-seater).
and more than just transportation is involved, but the same vision still applies.
the real test would be whether the electrical system could be kept operating–if there would be enough spare parts.
given the battery supply constraint (which you mention) there’s no point in nissan trying to increase volume with lower prices, since battery supply is not very elastic.
the one scenario i don’t find likely is one in which we worry about buying family vehicles that provide for 200,000 miles of motoring about in any manner that resembles today’s paradigm.
renault reckon that by the time they hit around 500,000 – 1 million electric vehicle sales of all types they will be able to sell for the same price as the diesel without the subsidy.
a camry engine is going to take the impact for you because it’s in front of you.
| our finite world | fresh green world it is no longer necessary to guess or estimate the costs of running an electric car, maintenance, battery costs etc as the figures are available on the renault website for vehicles you can actually order, together with a maintenance contract, and conveniently the batteries are leased to the cost shows separately and covers depreciation.
no jobs there, no air travel and (or very little and highly expensive), no jobs there, related industries shrinking or collapsing also.
people here are very happy with hybrids, the taxi drivers specially like the prius.
if they can only run a few hours at a time, that is better than nothing.
since your house circuit breakers won’t endure 466 amperes, you have to throttle down the amperes and take longer than 1 hour.
i think of the american bikes of the 30′s and 40′s and the modest means of the family’s that owned them, they didn’t have gears.
if i can charge it on my solar panels then in my mind it is a free trip.
i did everything with that vehicle from firewood to towing a 25 foot boat on a trailer (carefully and sometimes with the heater on in the summer to keep the engine cool).
nev-hpv for local travel combined with public transportation for the rest.
if this is correct, it would mean that more batteries would have to be produced, and this would necessitate additional resource consumption.
figuring out a low-tech bicycle should be a high priority.
marianne says: september 15, 2011 at 4:25 pm it would be far better to store electrical energy in hot water heaters
with all of the vehicles, there is a problem of integrating them into the mix that is currently available.
interestingly, back in the 1930′s and 1940′s, mexican railroads worked well; back in the bad old days of the porfirio díaz dictatorship, mexican railroads were world class.
what is relevant (again in the absence of a larger action) is how best i can make use of the remaining driving infrastructure.
my father following his day of work and my little league practice (in our small town), thought nothing of sitting on his front porch swing drinking a beer and talking to the neighbors who were passing by, or on their own porches.
interest rates may also be higher.
most water treatment systems have storage at various stages, including the final product stage (various municipalities around pennsylvania seem to have a couple of days worth of treated water).
when i think of long lasting, low energy consumption goods, i think of things like wheel barrows, and pots and pans, and looms for cloth that can be operated without electricity.
i also appreciate the use of numbers (facts and figures) so much of the energy debate is assertions with no information content.
at another angle, with the availability of a number of electric motorcycles, i wonder when someone will simply use the trike angle and build an enclosed electric one.
the elites who purchase the new plug-in vehicles will then have some (a little) financial incentive to support this program and the poor would benefit.
i can envision widespread international trade even following a complete collapse of industrial civilization.
you incur that risk for the joyous privilege of charging up a battery 10+ hrs to get 1 hour of use at a price 25% higher than a conventional vehicle, to extend oil supply a few days.
it is never going to work if we have to share the road with 70 mph, 3,000 lb steel boxes operated by people who may or may not be competent and not distracted.
now my friend who lives in indiana and drives 50+ miles per day decided to go for a prius.
fiscal confederation, not break-up our base case with an overwhelming probability is that the euro moves slowly (and painfully) towards some kind of fiscal integration.
for example, a small-scale steel mill may be set up, in a town where there is available coking coal and scrap iron, making products such as steel tubing for bicycle frames.
the problem here it that the technology is likely not easily downward scalable.
and furthermore, the oil we would have used stays in the world supply, to be used elsewhere.
a lot of folks have their heads in the clouds, thinking we can all drive electric plug in vehicles, with 300 mile ranges, and buy them for $15,000 a piece.
i am not sure that we can expect to have vehicles, for precisely this reason.
i also don’t like to goto church sweaty.
there is also the possibility that the us’s debt problems (or those of the uk, or some other large power) could lead to payment problems among nations.
as for cars, i simply don’t understand the hp mind set there at all.
the nissan leaf would use electricity estimated at 2 cents a mile, or $20, so the cost of the nissan leaf lease, plus its fuel costs would be $369 month.
if someone is going to run a day care, it can’t be done long distance (but it can be done in the home).
the number of charge / discharge cycles is important.
in this way, it is argued, the improved efficiency in the electricity system will be adequate to totally energise those cars without needing any augmented sources of power.
c’mon – we can live without that just fine.
it is no longer necessary to guess or estimate the costs of running an electric car, maintenance, battery costs etc as the figures are available on the renault website for vehicles you can actually order, together with a maintenance contract, and conveniently the batteries are leased to the cost shows separately and covers depreciation.
if sales prices remain at their current levels, and the government is not able to keep up subsidies, monthly payments to buy the cars will put the cars out of reach for many buyers.
so the actual costs for more amerikans is undoubtably not as good as 19 cents.
he told me that after ww2, it was an even slower lifestyle.
if debt were completely interest free, and buyers valued a dollar today the same as a dollar 20 years from now, theoretically an average fuel cost of $6.75 over the life of the vehicle would balance costs out (since this would imply a gasoline cost of 22.5 cents per mile).
if we use bicycles, we need ones that won’t need new tires, or some other important part, that you and your neighbors can’t put together quickly with local materials.
gail, that’s an incredibly thorough and well-connected evaluation of plug-in vehicles.
gail, international trade worked before there was an effective international finance system.
there is no way to find a lot of minerals without drilling a hole and knowing what is coming out of it.
sure gas is makeing a colossal mess of everything too, but governments love oil and oil companies, and looks the other way at the damage they do.
with expensive batteries, it just means a return to smaller and lighter cars which in the end will provide the same utility as current large vehicles.
natural gas and coal used to run power plants are mostly fuels from us sources.
i would argue that this is a primary reason for both plug-in autos and for higher mileage standards for cars in general.
you make an important point using natural gas to make electric to drive cars allows us to deplete both oil and natural gas by driving.
the purchase price, insurance and taxes for many suvs and pickups are very much the same as for smaller, fuel efficient cars.
much like your ranger, no crash protection, no ac, no power windows, or anything that adds weight or uses extra energy.
the bus stop (for between towns) went away in the 60′s, but interesting returned last year at least for going to the big city (of 45,000).
especially in view of the fact that a turbo charged diesel vehicle ends up arguably emitting less pollution whilst maintaining all the advantages of the traditional petrol engined car.
it can still work, on a more limited scale, with more controls.
if i can charge it on my solar panels then in my mind it is a free trip.
allow individual drivers to drive longer.
whether or not the vehicles are really scalable, will save co2, or will help detroit automakers, i think this is a major reason for plug-in electric vehicles.
or better yet, no fossil fuel use for passenger vehicle transportation.
in china, we hear about companies with fraudulent financial statements.
people may buy them with this view, but i would argue that there is no point in subsidizing costs if this is the purpose–owners will get their reward, if there is a reward of this sort.
a spoked wheel also does not seem to be a huge challenge – although i wonder what kind of simple technology might be used to create a basic rubber tire (or something functionally equivalent).
that will save a lot of money to use to buy the car.
am hi dave, in our finite world of oil, your “national max speed of 35 mph with mandatory governors” done worldwide could kick the shortage problem down the road a good hundred years.
even gm can see the logic of this approach: the turbodiesel chevrolet cruze is expected in 2013 and will probably be even cheaper than the the vw.
human bungling, cupidity and incompetence, whether governmental or private enterprise, is infinitely renewable and inexhaustible.
a few years ago we of the chicago branch of my wife’s extended family traveled to and from philadelphia, for a major family event, via amtrak.
while it is possible that there will be no cars at all in a total doomer world, in descent i would say that there will be cars, and it will be what he described to me in the 30′s and 40′s.
a lot of folks have their heads in the clouds, thinking we can all drive electric plug in vehicles, with 300 mile ranges, and buy them for $15,000 a piece.
very expensive delivery services (medical, materials, maintenance, goods) seem to be needed – and would this way be shared by many and use much less oil compared to our current regular driving to shopping sprees)… to me this looks like a potential way to decompress slowly.
the cheapest toyota prius is $24565, and the cheapest vw jetta tdi is $24401.
in this way, it is argued, the improved efficiency in the electricity system will be adequate to totally energise those cars without needing any augmented sources of power.
especially in view of the fact that a turbo charged diesel vehicle ends up arguably emitting less pollution whilst maintaining all the advantages of the traditional petrol engined car.
renault reckon that by the time they hit around 500,000 – 1 million electric vehicle sales of all types they will be able to sell for the same price as the diesel without the subsidy.
first, most amerikans dont own or want to own efficent gas-burners, some to be sure, but not many.
speaking of which, a battery inspection program should become a routine part of any plug-in vehicle resale.
i think your model of thinking, “zeroing out” trips could become a cultural phenomena for drivers of this (and like designed) vehicles.
it should be noted though that the first service occurs after a year or 12,000 miles, with services thereafter only at 25,000 mile intervals.
for those who find these suggestions unpalatable for economic reasons, personal reasons or what-have-you – then it would seem to be your responsibility to suggest how the laws of physics can be dealt with as oil depletes, the planet warms, the oceans acidity, deserts spread, aquifers deplete, species extinction rates increase, millions of humans starve in africa, human population grows, etc.
she just hated the gasoline station and wasting her money she said.
20 amp breakers are typical for residences, but rewiring the house might double that.
if you get 100% efficiency in the battery in and out, that’s the target number for a camry equivalent vehicle running 1 hour.
i think lev’s and nev’s offer an opportunity to get out of the detroit mentality that everything that you drive must be like an ice vehicle.
i am guessing what we should be using most of the solar panels for is pumping water for the cities that don’t have gravity fed sources.
the power use just isn’t large enough to make a difference.
furthermore, many people will eliminate them completely, because they don’t meet their family’s transportation needs.
a third view is that we need to plan on riding horses, or horse driven carts, but where would we raise all of the horses, and what would we feed them.
a spoked wheel also does not seem to be a huge challenge – although i wonder what kind of simple technology might be used to create a basic rubber tire (or something functionally equivalent).
the government cannot possibility afford to pay subsidies to a large number of auto owners, and auto companies cannot expect to offer cut-rate deals, once they are selling very many of the vehicles.
i suspect that chains and gears can be salvaged from millions of unused bikes for the next 50 years or so.
the second problem comes on resale of the vehicle.
with a typical 3000-lb vehicle, the weight and cost of the battery is significant because you need a big expensive battery to haul around a lot of mass that really doesn’t add to the utility of the vehicle.
in the same period this year they sold 6,467 hybrids and more than 500.000 fuel vehicles and that in spite of a severe economic crisis and 20% unemployment
all that thanks to technologies which make a lot of personal meetings aspects obsolete).
i truly love france, but trying to manage a bike on a high speed train is not much fun.
for $10,999, $2700 more than the gas version, it seems a reasonable premium for something that draws 1kw when charging, an easy load on my solar panels.
to convert the transportation portion of our economy to one driven by slower and lower cost public transportation (forget high speed trains).
even if we restrict it to currently available (in the u.s.) vehicles you have the vw jetta tdi which uses a bit more fuel than the volt but carries about 50% more weight (and can tow a 1000 pound trailer) while costing slightly over 50% as much (base price about $22,500).
in the north, where freezing and thawing is an issue, the roads will need to be repaired, regardless of how little traffic they have.
no car industry, whether electric or conventional – simply not needed.
i think all of the emphasis on high tech (use more coal and natural gas) solutions has kept people from thinking about solutions at a human scale level, that can really be maintained for the long term.
he is of the opinion that there is potential to increase the energy density by a factor of three in the immediate future, ~10 years.
here is the renault fr website for those comfortable in french: http://www.renault-ze.com/fr-fr/gamme-z.e./renault-kangoo-express-z.e./presentation-15.html and here is the full pdf of the prices for battery hire and so on for renault uk: http://www.renault.co.uk/resources/pdf/brochures/ze_pg.pdf a bit of calculation shows that off-setting battery hire and electricity against petrol in an urban environment and allowing 3 miles per kwh to cover the extra draw from heating etc and using £1.33/litre the petrol price at maybe 8 miles/litre or so you are several hundred pounds a year better off with the electric vehicle, enough very roughly to cover the excise duty payable on petrol, so in the us it would be pretty well a wash.
if international finance doesn’t “work,” international trade becomes much more cumbersome.
remember that there was trade between europe and china (the silk road) over 2000 years ago.
the current nissan leaf’s base list price (before subsidies) is $35,200, which includes the cost of a 24 kwh battery estimated to cost $15,600 (or $650 per kwh).
the cheapest toyota prius is $24565, and the cheapest vw jetta tdi is $24401.
it would be difficult to run the international companies without air travel.
the original vw beetle made do with 34 horsepower, even when first sold in the u.s.a. even the original ford v8 of the 1930s, praised by clyde barrow for its performance escaping from police, had only 65 horsepower.
there are no cars, but the countryside can be canvassed to hire one for these critical trips.
i am not sure that we can expect to have vehicles, for precisely this reason.
but resources ($, productivity, energy) flowing into other, new and yet to emerge industries which would provide the alternatives/similars.
marianne says: september 15, 2011 at 4:50 pm it would be better to make more high occupancy vehicle (hov) lanes than push ev too hard imho.
researchers such as mr. whitacre, the national academies of science and even some car makers aren’t convinced [the high cost of batteries will come down], mainly because more than 30% of the cost of the batteries comes from metals such as nickel, manganese and cobalt.
even the prius can carry over 800 pounds (though it is sold as a five-seater).
there may be other low tech approaches that would work as well, more barges, and upgrades to these.
hi gail, as much as i love bikes, i think we need the glorified golf carts (nev) for a variety of reasons: weather, disability, old age, babies and infants, etc.
the issue is that none of these things will last longer than the electric grid, and that may not be all that long.
using smart metering than electric cars even considering the costs of the batteries in cars.
not really needed for most of the workers, only old fashioned management styles keeps that concept alive http://www.teleworkresearchnetwork.com/outdated-management-practices-block-telework-and-flexible-work-styles/6127 (this is not so much fantasy, i and many folks i know can now work from anywhere – choosing home most often; i do not commute any more.
even though i think the gem nev’s are ugly, what stops me ultimately from buying its flatbed truck version is its reliance on high quality toads.
the small market is gone, as is the truck farming that supported it (they are now all dairy).
while the cruze is smaller than the vw jetta, it is still larger (inside) than the volt, and carries a larger load.
but none of them in my mind as low 2 wheel drive vehicles be able to survive what i believe the road will look like in 10 years.
i can tell you that everyone who is not in the far far leftist club in the bay area jokes about all the prius drivers and other hybrid and electric car drivers being smug, self absorbed types who are rude drivers.
the leaf and volt are both awesome science experiments, both culturally, and technologically.
if you want to run the car using 3/4 its power (150 hp) for 1 hour, that’s 150 x 745 = 112,000 watt hours.
no matter how much they insult us for not getting in line and wasting our money on an image.
as with everything in this descent (or step function down for a true doomer), working towards “local” xyz, community sufficiency, and very reduced expectations on comfort (i wear a real coat, gloves and a hat driving it in the winter), is what we should be doing now for ourselves and to help other people make that transition.
from what i can perceive (if we ignore for a moment that maintaining private transport as the primary means of travel is in big trouble, no matter how we try to do it) full-electric plug-in vehicles have so many disadvantages that they won’t make it in the market place.
the used ones won’t sell for $40,000.
at some point, it is necessary to check up on workers in person.
the economic cost is, in many ways, the least of the concerns investors should have about a break-up.
of course, if we simply compare the emissions of plug-in cars to emissions of cars with internal combustion engines (ice), there will be appear to be appear to be a co2 emission savings per car, with the amount depending on what fuel is used for electricity (coal, natural gas, nuclear, wind, etc.).
for instance no water for philly in a place which has water is different than no water for la in a place that is a desert.
for instance nyc is essentially gravity fed, as is harrisburg’s.
i don’t think it would permit our current bau lifestyle, though.
i think working with india would be the same.
allow more people to drive vehicles, and drive them further.
nev-hpv for local travel combined with public transportation for the rest.
let me start with a glimmer of hope, before i move on to the grim reality: there are reports the nissan leaf battery costs nissan much less than you state in your article: http://gas2.org/2010/05/05/report-nissan-leafs-battery-costs-a-staggeringly-cheap-375kwh-to-produce/ this article puts the cost of the leaf battery at $375/kwh.
these big, overpowered vehicles waste vast amounts of gasoline.
if the real issue is saving gasoline, it may be that use of cars such as today’s prius provide more “bang for the buck,” and are also be more salable to second-hand vehicle buyers.
the analysis of mpg, cost of ownership, affordability, status symbols, etc strikes me as a bit odd for a blog called “our finite world” – more like a consumer’s report analysis.
i would argue that for some people, a major motivation for buying a plug-in vehicle today is to be first in the neighborhood with such a car.
in china, we hear about companies with fraudulent financial statements.
hi dave, in our finite world of oil, your “national max speed of 35 mph with mandatory governors” done worldwide could kick the shortage problem down the road a good hundred years.
no car industry, whether electric or conventional – simply not needed.
without the electrical system, it is hard to transport oil (pipelines use electricity, pumps use electricity) and to refine oil.
second, there is technology advancement in battery technology that will provide 400 mile range probably sooner rather than later.
you said back in march: “i have signed a contract with springer to write a short (125 page) book, tentatively called “beyond hubbert: how limited oil supplies cause economic crises.”
chris harries says: september 8, 2011 at 1:23 am hi gail, here in australia a popular rationale for plug-in cars argues this: a very large numbers of plug-in cars can act as a giant sponge (electricity can be charged and discharged from them into the grid depending on the time of day or night) and via this means peaks in the larger electricty system can be ironed out and the power system can thus operate much more efficiently.
one of these reasons is that many people believe that plug-in automobiles will reduce co2 emissions.
fuel costs even for these “monsters” are a trivial part of the cost of owning and running them unless you are putting a lot of miles on them.
it would be nice if the system got fixed.
the chances of the whole thing working seem pretty remote.
slow travel; our passenger train was repeatedly shunted onto a siding so the lordly freight trains could take priority.
of course, this begs the question then why the leaf is still so expensive.
les d. says: september 7, 2011 at 12:39 pm gail, one point you haven’t touched on is how poor electric vehicles are at carrying loads.
the chevy volt, for example, has a load capacity of a little over 700 pounds.
first, most amerikans dont own or want to own efficent gas-burners, some to be sure, but not many.
the number of charge / discharge cycles is important.
for $10,999, $2700 more than the gas version, it seems a reasonable premium for something that draws 1kw when charging, an easy load on my solar panels.
just saying you missed my reducing the horsepower to 3/4 maximum for typical driving.
my entire town of 45,000 people is either 25 or 35mph and the rule of law operates there as well.
bicycle dave says: september 7, 2011 at 10:23 pm hi gail, although the use of bicycles on the ho chi minh trail has been somewhat romanticized and exaggerated, never-the-less, bikes moved a lot of material under very adverse conditions.
these costs will be shared very unequally among owners, with the early owners paying a disproportionate share of the costs.
this lower battery requirement keeps the cost of the vehicle lower, and keeps the replacement cost of the battery lower.
if there is a bike like with lots of regular bikes, and not too many electrics, i can see this would be a problem.
i see no compelling reason for high speed trains.
a nissan versawould lease for $200 month, with a $1999 initial payment.
i agree that it is not likely that battery powered vehicles will create any significant in-roads if one assumes that the mass of current vehicles remains the same.
i think the giant sponge idea has been disproved as impractical, and also that the quantity of storage would be too small.
according to the calculator i used, the market value of the (originally $35,000 car) after 4 years will be $19,600.
the used ones won’t sell for $40,000.
if we are entering into a period of fuel shortages, this might be a major reason for electric vehicles, if the price of electric vehicles can be brought down low enough.
the cost of installing the system for what i expect would be a fairly small number of users would seem to be prohibitively high as well.
so reducing battery costs may be a challenge.
hi gail: excellent post.
that said, the immense subsides the us has historically lavished on oil companies are probably not going anywhere, but i think its worth considering gas is only ‘cheap’ because amerikan and world taxpayers subsidize it so heavily in the first place.
but resources ($, productivity, energy) flowing into other, new and yet to emerge industries which would provide the alternatives/similars.
on a different administrative subject, the “star” rating on posts are currently messed up, (although i noticed some stars for this post suddenly appeared this afternoon).
thus, the monthly cost would be $48 higher with a nissan leaf compared to a versa at a fuel cost of $3.63 month.
the gem, polaris, and others who have been working in or towards those regulations may make that class more of a reality, but it is going to take more entrants with different designs (i think the gem is incredibly ugly for instance), and different price points.
for example, a small-scale steel mill may be set up, in a town where there is available coking coal and scrap iron, making products such as steel tubing for bicycle frames.
a hospital stay can buy truck loads of gasoline.)
the electric vehicle in cheaper in europe, likely comparable in the us, and as subsidies reduce there are good prospects of being able to still remain competitive whilst shouldering their full share of taxation, and low maintenance costs are thrown in as a freebie.
in addition, many people, like me, are driving gas guzzeling monsters (2000 expedition) because they like, and can still afford, big vehicles, or because they drive little, or got them used at a low price.
a wealthy individual benefits from a fuel efficient car much less than a poor individual does.
i think with this new prius plug in will help me give up on certain retail experiences and settle on closer solutions for pizza, milk, 2×4′s, whatever.
my argument is as follows: world oil production is basically maxed out.
i would argue that oil imports will decline, regardless of what we do.
carpool more, and 3) use more efficient modes of transportation.
the frame is really not an issue as bamboo is quite adequate (probably other woods also).
a few days ago, i read about a research group that invented a new gel lithium battery, which they claim will be better and cheaper to produce than the current ones.
and you get to pay 25% more for the opportunity to endure all that.
bottom line is, amerikan gas is at least 1/2 or maybe even a 1/3 if what is should be.
since your house circuit breakers won’t endure 466 amperes, you have to throttle down the amperes and take longer than 1 hour.
massless cars are deathtraps in an crash.
people don’t pay more for a car than the loan officer will approve for a loan, plus their available down payment.
a watt is 1 volt x 1 ampere.
this influences what kind of nev/lev plugins that i am interested in, we own a prius which i’ve contemplated giving to my step daughter, and buying something “better”, either the new prius hybrid or leaf/volt.
better lubricants, manufacturing methods, and materials make a big difference in durability.
1 lousy hour in a camry massed car takes 10 hrs to charge up, if you rewire your house, and if you have a non existent 100% efficient in/out battery.
personally, i like to think that there are still some opportunities to mitigate the worst consequences of peak everything.
for gem that is probably why they focused their initial marketing on campus’s, military bases, places like that.
the alternative fuel-saving option is an efficient internal combustion engine.
mass production, using ever more complex robots, can lower production cost.
hi owen, maybe everything you state above is true, if one drives there 200 hp camry full throttle 100% of the time.
compareing the cost of a pih@25.1 cents p/m, then saying an ‘efficent’ gas-burner comes in a 19.6 cents.
road maintenance and repairs average about 3 cents a mile or $30 month for 1,000 miles of travel, based on a comparison ofhighway and public street construction costs to vehicle miles traveled.
sure gas is makeing a colossal mess of everything too, but governments love oil and oil companies, and looks the other way at the damage they do.
the cost of fuel will be 12.1 cents per mile, at today’s price of $3.63 gallon, making the total cost (excluding interest on loans and vehicle maintenance) 19.6 cents per mile.
so don’t expect advancements either in using car batteries and smart grid to even out utility loads.
however, if as a society, you have sunk everything into long lasting, low energy consumption goods, your decline will be that much less painful as the rest of the world realigns with a resource constrained future.
only a few people realize the high cost of car-dependency does not lie strictly in the price of gas, or what a barrel of oil will go for in 10 years, but all the other costs of maintaining a car-dependant system are whats really going to drag us down.
unfortunately, social and political factors prevent such an efficient deployment of battery resources.
they just found an enormous copper deposit right near the southern alaska coast.
in the north, where freezing and thawing is an issue, the roads will need to be repaired, regardless of how little traffic they have.
i even used them where it was hilly.
he states that electric vehicles will use the same amount of energy per household as our refrigerators.
in spite of aid from the government of up to 6,000 euros per car, in a fund of 76 million euros.
however, they do contribute green feel goodness and less guilt in a civilization where the misery index in rapidly escalating, so maybe that is worth something.
if you want electricity for those sites as well, i think the ability to make a generator out of millions of spare alternators should be pretty simple.
there is quite a bit of local work that can’t be done long-distance.
all you would need is a single battery cycle test and a certified test result, much like a smog check, which is routine in california.
japan and german are taking nuclear off line now.
first, there are more efficient modes than personal vehicles, which require the transport of 3000 pounds of car to move 150-300 pounds of payload (1 or 2 passengers).
gailtheactuary says: september 8, 2011 at 9:44 pm i think a big part of our problem is that we can’t get any kind of agreement as to how we need to change.
at this point, i personally would not make a push for plug-in vehicles, but i can understand why some people might want to do so, especially if they are of the belief that costs can come down substantially in the future.
schoff says: september 19, 2011 at 3:34 pm i miss my 2.8l 4×4 extended cab 1985 s10 pickup, it had 110 hp.
we have a saying about walk before we run; regarding trains, we should try skootch before we crawl.
it is never going to work if we have to share the road with 70 mph, 3,000 lb steel boxes operated by people who may or may not be competent and not distracted.
bill simpson says: september 19, 2011 at 4:20 am the vast majority of cars on the road today are far more powerful than they need to be to get a few people (and often only one person) from one place to another.
i think with this new prius plug in will help me give up on certain retail experiences and settle on closer solutions for pizza, milk, 2×4′s, whatever.
if there was a system in place to encourage efficient distribution of battery resources, i would gladly participate in and support in.
in fact, inspecting a battery should be easier than inspecting a more complicated gasoline engine.
i did the math and they were prohibitively expensive and it just did not make sense.
of course, we all benefit when the poor have access to affordable transportation to get them to work.
but is a 2 seater, appropriate for hauling groceries, materials, and going to doctor’s appointments, no ac, no heat.
if you want electricity for those sites as well, i think the ability to make a generator out of millions of spare alternators should be pretty simple.
a camry engine is going to take the impact for you because it’s in front of you.
of course, this is a socialist idea that would never gain traction in the u.s. a (slightly) more acceptable alternative might be to give incentives to lower income buyers of second-hand plug-in vehicles.
second, amerika heavilty sudsidizies both the production and consumption of fossil-fuels in ways to numerous to list.
i think lev’s and nev’s offer an opportunity to get out of the detroit mentality that everything that you drive must be like an ice vehicle.
i am afraid we need to wait until everything falls apart, and then we use whatever is available, which may not be much at all.
i can envision widespread international trade even following a complete collapse of industrial civilization.
these big, overpowered vehicles waste vast amounts of gasoline.
you incur that risk for the joyous privilege of charging up a battery 10+ hrs to get 1 hour of use at a price 25% higher than a conventional vehicle, to extend oil supply a few days.
at another angle, with the availability of a number of electric motorcycles, i wonder when someone will simply use the trike angle and build an enclosed electric one.
for example (us centric): national max speed 35 mph with mandatory governors, elimination of half the public roadways, no new parking facilities, significant tax increases for private vehicle weight, etc.
i would imagine that the downtown environments of california like mountainview would work just fine as well since the speed limit of 25mph and the “rule of law” both operate there.
plug-in cars wont succeed,even if they appear to, because the problem with cars, as it turns out, is cars themselves.
i know that in china, there have been problems with electric bicycles going too fast relative to regular bicycles, and there being accidents.
if you or i don’t use a model with a gasoline engine, and instead buy a plug-in model, admittedly there will be a reduction in the gasoline that you or i would use.
i’d like to believe that i could drive them now in my town without problems; however, i will wait another five or so years of descent when half the traffic is gone….
to convert the transportation portion of our economy to one driven by slower and lower cost public transportation (forget high speed trains).
no doubt some will want to argue that renault have got their sums wrong, but for customers the answers are in.
anything that allows what liquid fuel supply we have to go farther, such as supplementing oil powered cars with cars powered by electricity, allows more people to drive cars, and to drive them further.
we have a saying about walk before we run; regarding trains, we should try skootch before we crawl.
like it or not, private cars will be part of the transport mix for the next umpteen years, but it seems that, unless there are incredible advances in electric technology, super efficient fossil fueled engines, coupled with downsizing of vehicle weight, will easily win the day.
very expensive delivery services (medical, materials, maintenance, goods) seem to be needed – and would this way be shared by many and use much less oil compared to our current regular driving to shopping sprees)… to me this looks like a potential way to decompress slowly.
i don’t think it would permit our current bau lifestyle, though.
even if i’m wrong about the time frame (say 100 years instead of 20), what kind of morality supports the idea that today’s generation of humans has the right to degrade the biosphere of our planet and deprive many future generations of a livable planet.
stravinsky7 says: september 9, 2011 at 10:11 pm the leaf and volt are both awesome science experiments, both culturally, and technologically.
i’m not saying that peak oil won’t be a big crisis.
he is of the opinion that there is potential to increase the energy density by a factor of three in the immediate future, ~10 years.
if one needs to account for interest issues, the average cost per gallon would need to be much higher than $6.75–perhaps be double this amount, depending on the interest rate.
we may have to go back to what people did before–ride animals, or have animals pull carts.
they just found an enormous copper deposit right near the southern alaska coast.
of course, one might ask whether bicycles might not work just as well, for the short distances under discussion.
taking all factors into account, the best solution would be to equip the most needy people with the least expensive vehicles.
a grandniece was badly burned by leaning against a wall by her seat; the heating system had gone postal.
the chevy volt has a base price of $40,280, which includes a 16 kwh batteryestimated to cost $10,000 (or $625 per kwh).
another small factory might be set up near a rubber plantation to make bicycle tires.
the small market is gone, as is the truck farming that supported it (they are now all dairy).
they are tied to one political ideological group and more specifically one class within that political ideological group (upper middle class and wealthy liberals…generally far left liberals which come across as smug to everyone else…south park did an excellent critique on this) and it turns off everyone else who isn’t in their camp, pretty hard core.
i could see glorified golf carts a lot more easily.
only 2% of businesses consider buying evs after studying their problems, and specially the resale value, next to nothing.
the frame is really not an issue as bamboo is quite adequate (probably other woods also).
while it is going to be a few more miles than that (15), i think the prius plug in could be a game changer over the next five years.
cheap fuel is nonrenewable and in increasingly short supply.
under the current structure and with the current membership, the euro does not work.
where we have railroad tracks, there may be simpler systems that could be used on the rail tracks, as long as these can be maintained.
pm ice is here to stay, agreed.
what is relevant (again in the absence of a larger action) is how best i can make use of the remaining driving infrastructure.
it may be that electricity supplies are as constrained as oil supplies.
lease comparison calculations–for those interested: a nissan leaf leases for $349 month, after taking full credit for the $7,500 rebate and a $1999 initial payment.
it would make an interesting table, taking the top 50 municipalities in this context and then their setting.
as i’ve said before, it is very hard to have effective solutions when the problem itself is not understood.
prices for these metals, which are set on commodities markets, aren’t expected to fall with increasing battery production—and may even rise as demand grows, according to a study by the academies of science released earlier this year and engineers familiar with battery production.
regarding the enclosed motorcycle, i think part of it may have to do with when a vehicle becomes too close to something that is regulated by crash-worthy tests.
where we have railroad tracks, there may be simpler systems that could be used on the rail tracks, as long as these can be maintained.
unfortunately, social and political factors prevent such an efficient deployment of battery resources.
in addition, many people, like me, are driving gas guzzeling monsters (2000 expedition) because they like, and can still afford, big vehicles, or because they drive little, or got them used at a low price.
gailtheactuary says: september 10, 2011 at 5:11 pm it would be possible to cut back, but there are limits.
people will be willing to pay for the value they get, and the small load capacity reduces the value of the vehicles.
in his home town, the 1500 square foot slaughter house doesn’t exist.
yes, i probably should have written about green feel-goodness too, but that would have offended some.
solutions has kept people from thinking about solutions at a human scale level, that can really be maintained for the long term.
we would no longer be looking for a “steady stream of new products”, but we could still get a steady stream of simple and durable products which are beyond the capabilities of local sources.
the gem, polaris, and others who have been working in or towards those regulations may make that class more of a reality, but it is going to take more entrants with different designs (i think the gem is incredibly ugly for instance), and different price points.
the lifetime cost of a chevy volt is similar, if we include the cost of an extra battery.
once enought of them are manufactured, a used vehicle market will develop.
many work trips will be able to be accomplished without using any gasoline or diesel.
it’s all silly and is going to kill people in car wrecks even before it kills people wasting energy on a non viable solution.
these are to some extent covered by gasoline costs, but are not included in the electric pricing.
for instance nyc is essentially gravity fed, as is harrisburg’s.
if there was a system in place to encourage efficient distribution of battery resources, i would gladly participate in and support in.
hi gail, here in australia a popular rationale for plug-in cars argues this: a very large numbers of plug-in cars can act as a giant sponge (electricity can be charged and discharged from them into the grid depending on the time of day or night) and via this means peaks in the larger electricty system can be ironed out and the power system can thus operate much more efficiently.
repairs will also need to follow major storms, with or without much traffic on the roads.
.zero-emission vehicles are eco-friendly vehicles such as electric vehicles evs and fuel-cell vehicles fcvs that have no tailpipe emissions of co2 or other gases..
it would be nice if the system got fixed.
the monthly gasoline cost of the nissan versa (assuming 1,000 miles of travel, a fuel cost of $3.63 gallon, and 30 miles per gallon for the nissan versa) would be $121, and the lease cost plus fuel cost would be $321.
a third view is that we need to plan on riding horses, or horse driven carts, but where would we raise all of the horses, and what would we feed them.
wonhyo says: september 11, 2011 at 12:06 pm gail, that’s an incredibly thorough and well-connected evaluation of plug-in vehicles.
i probably wouldn’t have written the post, except that some of the oil drum staff members had been discussing some related material behind the scenes, so i tried to work through the details, trying to figure out what the issues really were (rather than focusing on, say, whether better batteries could fix some perceived problem).
allow politicians to look like they are doing something.
although i would say a modest battery with 5 mile range would be useful for zeroing out gasoline consumption for most small trips.
i am an actuary interested in finite world issues - oil depletion, natural gas depletion, water shortages, and climate change.
taking all factors into account, the best solution would be to equip the most needy people with the least expensive vehicles.
bill, unfortunately, gas-guzzling monsters are still the logical choice for many americans.
gm needs to develop products that have the same cost structure and profit margins as their current vehicles and so they develop an expensive gas/plug-in electric hybrid vehicle which can maintain their profit margins and corporate structure.
they can be rewound without the need for much additional copper being mined.
only a few people realize the high cost of car-dependency does not lie strictly in the price of gas, or what a barrel of oil will go for in 10 years, but all the other costs of maintaining a car-dependant system are whats really going to drag us down.
i think i was an adult, living on my own, before i had a bike without gears.
i would put the likelihood of breakup higher than the report suggests, especially over, say, a two year time frame.
allow business as usual (bau) to continue longer.
also, long slow charging seems to be better for batteries than the quick charge approach.
the risk case, of break-up, is considerably more costly and close to zero probability.
again, thanks for committing your thorough and systematic analysis into a well-written article, and thanks to the readers who post insightful comments.
we have biked in a retirement community in florida that allows nevs but only within the city limit – plus some other restrictions.
to those of us that follow the peak oil literature, it is well-understood that electric or hybrid cars neither help the oil depletion nor the atmospheric co2 problem and probably make them worse.
wind and solar pv are mostly one-time investments, that don’t require much ongoing fuel supply (except for maintenance).
consequently it is probably more likely that a company like tata or a golf cart manufacturer with lower overhead costs will be the successful electric car manufacturer.
another small factory might be set up near a rubber plantation to make bicycle tires.
i would put the likelihood of breakup higher than the report suggests, especially over, say, a two year time frame.

in the same period this year they sold 6,467 hybrids and more than 500.000 fuel vehicles and that in spite of a severe economic crisis and 20% unemployment
gailtheactuary says: september 13, 2011 at 1:05 pm regarding the enclosed motorcycle, i think part of it may have to do with when a vehicle becomes too close to something that is regulated by crash-worthy tests.
it still works in places where there is no effective international finance system: as an example, look at iran, where even with most trade theoretically prohibited, foreign goods are widely available.
more likely, it just lets someone else use the oil, that would be pumped regardless of whether it was you or someone else using it.
people here are very happy with hybrids, the taxi drivers specially like the prius.
for the home, you are going to have lots of small legacy solar, like d.lights and sunwize systems for a little bit of lighting, and then some standalone pv homes that will have electricity for decades during the day, but not at night (unless you can manufacture sulfuric acide and refurb batteries).
chris i believe i’ve read that the additional charging and discharging would cause the batteries to wear out more quickly.
if you want to run the car using 3/4 its power (150 hp) for 1 hour, that’s 150 x 745 = 112,000 watt hours.
metals can be discovered and recycled.
ideally, the poorest car buyers should get the largest subsidies to purchase the most efficient cars.
electric motors can be easily replaced.
the rails were in miserable shape.
equipping everyone with priuses that get double the average fuel efficiency does nothing if consumers use that to double the miles driven.
my complaints are really with the idea that we can keep bau going with electric cars.
in spite of aid from the government of up to 6,000 euros per car, in a fund of 76 million euros.

these types of things definitely deter people like me and more moderates and conservatives from every joining the prius or other hybrid club.
for gem that is probably why they focused their initial marketing on campus’s, military bases, places like that.
only 2% of businesses consider buying evs after studying their problems, and specially the resale value, next to nothing.
the most efficient concept in urban environments is personal rapid transit (prt), which uses a 1500 pound pod on an electrified monorail to carry up to 6 passengers, a ratio of 250-1500 pounds of vehicle per pound of passenger (“v/p”), compared to 750-300 v/p for a typical passenger automobile.
all you would need is a single battery cycle test and a certified test result, much like a smog check, which is routine in california.
these costs, according to my calculations, amount to about 3 cents a mile.

food costs will skyrocket – but that also will probably drive folks to try growing stuff close to home.
some people had them in the family or whatever, and you borrowed them for the critical trip to the hospital, a medical specialist, or a relative’s death or a very very special event.
while the cruze is smaller than the vw jetta, it is still larger (inside) than the volt, and carries a larger load.
an electric world | scoop.it factoids: toyota camry is 170 horsepower in the base model.
the insurance on the ford is probably less than either of the fuel efficient vehicles because it will cost a lot less to repair if it is in an accident, and any mechanical repairs for the ford will cost much less.
to greatly encourage and provide safety for neighborhood electric vehicles (nev) which are basically weatherized golf carts and human powered vehicles (hpv) such as velo-mobiles, bikes and trikes.
now people can get 200,000 miles, or more, out of them.
if we use bicycles, we need ones that won’t need new tires, or some other important part, that you and your neighbors can’t put together quickly with local materials.
they are tied to one political ideological group and more specifically one class within that political ideological group (upper middle class and wealthy liberals…generally far left liberals which come across as smug to everyone else…south park did an excellent critique on this) and it turns off everyone else who isn’t in their camp, pretty hard core.
the point would be $$$ to rewire your house for 240 v (or higher) and 40 amp wires (you can’t just pound amperage through thin wires; they melt) as well as breakers, all so you can wait 10+ hours to have enough get up and go for 1 lousy camry equivalent hour.
for example, i can estimate that if i either rode a bike or commuted with my friend using her car that i could save at most $1000 a year in fuel costs.
with all of the vehicles, there is a problem of integrating them into the mix that is currently available.
although i agree that small amounts of fuel saved by individual actions are pretty futile, it seems to me that dramatic/extensive changes in public policy could make a real difference.
the chances of the whole thing working seem pretty remote.
although i would say a modest battery with 5 mile range would be useful for zeroing out gasoline consumption for most small trips.
the real power and glory of a bike comes from chains and gears (please – no rants from unicyclists).
schoff says: september 11, 2011 at 3:13 pm you have raised an interesting point which is part of my thinking, i don’t assume that the driving infrastructure will remain at its current quality (high), that it will decline dramatically.
gailtheactuary says: september 7, 2011 at 8:53 pm you make some good points.
the insurance on the ford is probably less than either of the fuel efficient vehicles because it will cost a lot less to repair if it is in an accident, and any mechanical repairs for the ford will cost much less.
remember that there was trade between europe and china (the silk road) over 2000 years ago.
i am unaware if that rationale has hit the us, but would be interested if the argument is based on solid logic or wishful thinking.
the high cost of plug in vehicles is not just the batteries–it is the cost of the cars themselves.
on a strictly dollars and cents basis, gas-o-line would be a clear loser on anything like an even playing field.zthis is not to say i think pih are a good idea, they are not.
if someone is going to run a day care, it can’t be done long distance (but it can be done in the home).
he also was arguing that things might get much better, cost-wise.
loan terms for a used cars are shorter than for new cars (often 36 months), putting the financing of expensive used cars out of the range of less well-off buyers, as well.
one condition of this second hand purchase incentive program should be that a government or independent agency inspect the battery for all vehicles resold under this program, to ensure that the second-hand buyer gets a battery in reasonably good shape.
a grandniece was badly burned by leaning against a wall by her seat; the heating system had gone postal.
millions of people drive pick-ups who never haul a thing.
i used to live next to a sewer lift station.
a more average engine (operative word average) at 200 hp will add, as will the typical automatic transmission, so the “typical” camry will weigh more (and carry more, so “curb weight” is probably the wrong comparison) than a leaf, but not a ton, as it were, more.
instead, the price of oil may drop by a tiny bit, and the oil will be bought by someone else.
there are no cars, but the countryside can be canvassed to hire one for these critical trips.
if a vehicle owner buys a 30 mile a gallon car for $15,000, and it also lasts for 200,000 miles, the cost of vehicle ownership will be 7.5 cents per mile.
the train station is gone, as are the tracks, but the bed is still there.
we may have to go back to what people did before–ride animals, or have animals pull carts.
i think roads will last much longer and need less maintenance (except from vegetation) if we only use them for nevs and hpvs.
but being smug about people being smug will not solve the transportation problem.
so we would be at risk of losing the oil (and probably natural gas) systems as well.
minorities i know in the bay can’t stand prius drivers either.
1 lousy hour in a camry massed car takes 10 hrs to charge up, if you rewire your house, and if you have a non existent 100% efficient in/out battery.
the chevy volt, for example, has a load capacity of a little over 700 pounds.
even gm can see the logic of this approach: the turbodiesel chevrolet cruze is expected in 2013 and will probably be even cheaper than the the vw.
the problem here it that the technology is likely not easily downward scalable.
chris harries says: september 12, 2011 at 5:51 pm from what i can perceive (if we ignore for a moment that maintaining private transport as the primary means of travel is in big trouble, no matter how we try to do it) full-electric plug-in vehicles have so many disadvantages that they won’t make it in the market place.
but many people do not make the comparison i make, and will want to purchase plug-in vehicles, on the assumption that because of the efficiency of electric engines, there is at least a small savings in co2, relative to ices, even with coal as a source of electricity.
gail, one point you haven’t touched on is how poor electric vehicles are at carrying loads.
the optimistic thought is that nissan is just exploiting its uniquely low battery cost, pricing relative to the competition, and reaping the additional profit.
but being smug about people being smug will not solve the transportation problem.
let me start with a glimmer of hope, before i move on to the grim reality: there are reports the nissan leaf battery costs nissan much less than you state in your article: http://gas2.org/2010/05/05/report-nissan-leafs-battery-costs-a-staggeringly-cheap-375kwh-to-produce/ this article puts the cost of the leaf battery at $375/kwh.
the world will extract as much oil from the ground as it is able.
the total cost is $50,280, or 25.1 cents per mile.
setting aside solutions other than personal automobiles, your analysis of various vehicle options is right on.
a few years ago we of the chicago branch of my wife’s extended family traveled to and from philadelphia, for a major family event, via amtrak.
fuel costs even for these “monsters” are a trivial part of the cost of owning and running them unless you are putting a lot of miles on them.
great comments from readers, too.
i don’t expect to be able to make use of any car for more than about 5-10 years, but during that time, having a plug-in maximizes the chances of my being able to make use of the car.
not everyone will see things this way, however, and the people who believe differently will want to purchase what they think will help for the long term.
bicycle dave says: september 8, 2011 at 10:32 pm hi gail, in a perfect scenario (most doubtful) we would conserve high energy sources (liquid fuel or big batteries) just for those activities that really need them.
slow travel; our passenger train was repeatedly shunted onto a siding so the lordly freight trains could take priority.
this is soon going to become a bottleneck and maybe a show stopper for vehicle sales other than old trucks.
we would no longer be looking for a “steady stream of new products”, but we could still get a steady stream of simple and durable products which are beyond the capabilities of local sources.
food transport would be a major concern.
panama corporation says: september 18, 2011 at 12:13 pm .zero-emission vehicles are eco-friendly vehicles such as electric vehicles evs and fuel-cell vehicles fcvs that have no tailpipe emissions of co2 or other gases..
downtothelastcookie says: september 8, 2011 at 1:46 am hi owen, maybe everything you state above is true, if one drives there 200 hp camry full throttle 100% of the time.
also, long slow charging seems to be better for batteries than the quick charge approach.
electric motors can be easily replaced.
the chevy volt will likely prove to fall into this situation.
even if the whole thing of storage could be worked out (and leave the person with electricity to drive the car when needed), adding and subtracting electricity would wear out the battery more quickly, and there would be an electrical loss in the round-trip.
and the huge monster may keep me out of intensive care if someone on the cell phone hits me.
i think you also have a problem with these cars now that they have an image problem.
i miss my 2.8l 4×4 extended cab 1985 s10 pickup, it had 110 hp.
they have a cab kit to enclose the vehicle and make it more weather friendly.
on a strictly dollars and cents basis, gas-o-line would be a clear loser on anything like an even playing field.zthis is not to say i think pih are a good idea, they are not.

interestingly, back in the 1930′s and 1940′s, mexican railroads worked well; back in the bad old days of the porfirio díaz dictatorship, mexican railroads were world class.
my v6 190hp tacoma 4×4 is definitely too much for the firewood, trailering, and towing that i do, except that when i get on the thruway they really expect me to go to 75mph.
i’d like to believe that i could drive them now in my town without problems; however, i will wait another five or so years of descent when half the traffic is gone….
electric motors can last decades.
this is because gasoline has been very cheap for the last 80 years.
so the actual costs for more amerikans is undoubtably not as good as 19 cents.
to have a 200 hp camry equivalent electric car requires 150,000 watts.
i see it here in pennsylvania with the disappearance of suburbans, big trucks, expeditions, etc as everyday vehicles.
bilateral trade between two such enterprises would be logical, and could be carried out by small sailing ships using practically no fossil fuel.
so don’t expect advancements either in using car batteries and smart grid to even out utility loads.
bicycle dave says: september 7, 2011 at 10:04 pm hi david, back in the good old days (maybe bad) when we jumped on a plane in blissful ignorance to go cycling in europe, we used trains in ireland and france.
some people had them in the family or whatever, and you borrowed them for the critical trip to the hospital, a medical specialist, or a relative’s death or a very very special event.
if a car is driven 12,000 miles a year and gets 30 miles to a gallon, it will use 400 gallons of fuel a year.
well perhaps local air quality *might* marginally improve over time, but even that is in doubt since imo, car-culture will collpse long before any of the benefits of so called plug-ins even become detectable.
from a cyclist perspective, i loved the trains in ireland – just roll your bike on the train with no extra preparation and no rush.
thats whats really crippling us, not ‘how’ the cars are powered.
however, even if cars were made marginally …..cleaner, i cant bring myself to call them green, b/c that would be a lie, none of the other problems created by personal, private 1 person per 4000 pound metal and plastic box get resolved-not one.
it would be far better to store electrical energy in hot water heaters using smart metering than electric cars even considering the costs of the batteries in cars.
this is a considerable saving, and renault should you choose to go for a maintenance contract do it for 80% of the diesel price.
gm needs to develop products that have the same cost structure and profit margins as their current vehicles and so they develop an expensive gas/plug-in electric hybrid vehicle which can maintain their profit margins and corporate structure.
i expect that using plug-in cars will raise co2 emissions.
i think you also have a problem with these cars now that they have an image problem.
second, amerika heavilty sudsidizies both the production and consumption of fossil-fuels in ways to numerous to list.
in addition, the nissan leaf will need to buy electricity over the life of the car, currently estimated to cost 2 cents per mile–probably more than this in the future, if electricity prices rise, in response to higher fossil fuel prices.
both nissan and chevy have put together better than market leasing arrangements for their new leaf and volt, in which they apply the full $7,000 rebate to the three-year lease term, and assume generous residual values.
plug-in works for a different class, call it 2 seater, 35 miles, 35mph using lead acid batteries.
i suspect that chains and gears can be salvaged from millions of unused bikes for the next 50 years or so.
there is no way to find a lot of minerals without drilling a hole and knowing what is coming out of it.
if we don’t have enough fuel for gasoline vehicles, perhaps electric vehicles will solve our problems, and we can continue to motor along for the next 50 or 100 years.
so using 40 amps, you can put 1 hour of camry driving into a battery over a period of 466 / 40 = over 10 hours.
that said, the immense subsides the us has historically lavished on oil companies are probably not going anywhere, but i think its worth considering gas is only ‘cheap’ because amerikan and world taxpayers subsidize it so heavily in the first place.
now your talking wet pants dave, i agree the happy motoring model seems to be scheduled for some reduction in the near term, and a lot of reduction in the medium term.

a lot of people seem to think of electric cars, wind turbines, and energy star refrigerators that can be operated with a little less electricity than last year’s model.
you make an important point using natural gas to make electric to drive cars allows us to deplete both oil and natural gas by driving.
cars and trucks have.
there might be a nice integration there to deal with peak solar power during the day.
it can still work, on a more limited scale, with more controls.
if we can use these instead of imported oil to power vehicles, the argument goes, it will reduce our dependence on imported oil.
the risk case, of break-up, is considerably more costly and close to zero probability.
there are more sophisticated ways of doing this too–tax structure, for example, can take from one group, to give to another.
better lubricants, manufacturing methods, and materials make a big difference in durability.
if by success, we mean “sell lots of vehicles” the answer is probably “no” unless the price comes down a lot–say 50% from today’s prices, so that price is in line with what common people can afford.
one condition of this second hand purchase incentive program should be that a government or independent agency inspect the battery for all vehicles resold under this program, to ensure that the second-hand buyer gets a battery in reasonably good shape.
that type of battery would make for a better hybrid that can get some range from the electric grid, especially if coupled to night time recharging using a simple charge timer when electrical power is generally dumped into resistors.
i would imagine that the downtown environments of california like mountainview would work just fine as well since the speed limit of 25mph and the “rule of law” both operate there.
europe’s “soft power” influence internationally would cease (as the concept of “europe” as an integrated polity becomes meaningless).
many work trips will be able to be accomplished without using any gasoline or diesel.
bilateral trade between two such enterprises would be logical, and could be carried out by small sailing ships using practically no fossil fuel.
unless there is a fairly large drop in price, there will be no drop in world oil production and consumption.
the conventional body-on-frame construction is simpler to repair and to service, and parts probably cost less.
if the leaf owner had to pay for road maintenance costs in addition, the total cost of the leaf would be $78 higher.
i can see, though, that my wording is probably too strong for a very “green” audience, that is hoping for plug-ins to save them.
that will save a lot of money to use to buy the car.
it will cause a financial mess as it destroys a lot of demand by decreasing disposable income.
but none of them in my mind as low 2 wheel drive vehicles be able to survive what i believe the road will look like in 10 years.
there may be other low tech approaches that would work as well, more barges, and upgrades to these.
i think roads will last much longer and need less maintenance (except from vegetation) if we only use them for nevs and hpvs.
i think working with india would be the same.

more likely, it just lets someone else use the oil, that would be pumped regardless of whether it was you or someone else using it.

gailtheactuary says: september 14, 2011 at 1:14 pm i am guessing what we should be using most of the solar panels for is pumping water for the cities that don’t have gravity fed sources.
the real power and glory of a bike comes from chains and gears (please – no rants from unicyclists).
furthermore, many people will eliminate them completely, because they don’t meet their family’s transportation needs.
even if the whole thing of storage could be worked out (and leave the person with electricity to drive the car when needed), adding and subtracting electricity would wear out the battery more quickly, and there would be an electrical loss in the round-trip.
it still works in places where there is no effective international finance system: as an example, look at iran, where even with most trade theoretically prohibited, foreign goods are widely available.
yes, i probably should have written about green feel-goodness too, but that would have offended some.
but i think the focus on recreating the ice experience is the problem, and this is due to the detroit mentality and its inability to bring out a different class of vehicles (at least since the mini-van).
the most efficient concept in urban environments is personal rapid transit (prt), which uses a 1500 pound pod on an electrified monorail to carry up to 6 passengers, a ratio of 250-1500 pounds of vehicle per pound of passenger (“v/p”), compared to 750-300 v/p for a typical passenger automobile.
i think things are kind of stalled–too many issues with summer vacations of critical people.
even though i think the gem nev’s are ugly, what stops me ultimately from buying its flatbed truck version is its reliance on high quality toads.
my v6 190hp tacoma 4×4 is definitely too much for the firewood, trailering, and towing that i do, except that when i get on the thruway they really expect me to go to 75mph.
given the constrained battery material supply, it’s much more effective to equipment many people with conventional hybrids than to equip a few people with all-battery plug-ins.
even if we restrict it to currently available (in the u.s.) vehicles you have the vw jetta tdi which uses a bit more fuel than the volt but carries about 50% more weight (and can tow a 1000 pound trailer) while costing slightly over 50% as much (base price about $22,500).
i mentioned the cost of maintaining roads, but didn’t say much about it because the post was getting long as it was.

you have raised an interesting point which is part of my thinking, i don’t assume that the driving infrastructure will remain at its current quality (high), that it will decline dramatically.
if there are 96 kwh of batteries available to reduce fuel consumption (the amounts are scalable): thus, if high battery costs present a problem from the point of view of automobile salability, or if battery supply is constrained, it would seem to make more sense to use batteries in prius-style hybrids, rather than in plug-in vehicles.
with expensive batteries, it just means a return to smaller and lighter cars which in the end will provide the same utility as current large vehicles.
the core of the solution has to be behavioral changes that transform our culture into one that requires very little energy-consuming activity in the first place, even before we start looking to efficiency.
i would argue that what electric cars do is allow us to raise our demand for other sources of energy (mostly coal and natural gas–sources of supply which are more elastic), so that we end up burning those sources faster, in an attempt to allowmore people to have cars, without exhausting our liquid fuel supply, or to allow people who have carsto drive them further.
because world oil production is now virtually flat (inelastic), regardless of oil price, the fact that we save oil doesn’t really make any difference in the whole scheme of things.
bicycle dave says: september 8, 2011 at 7:33 pm hi gail, as much as i love bikes, i think we need the glorified golf carts (nev) for a variety of reasons: weather, disability, old age, babies and infants, etc.
they likely will need cost decreases, just to be able to keep sales prices at their current levels, if they are to earn a reasonable profit.
gailtheactuary says: september 13, 2011 at 8:30 am the oil drum has more or less said they will not publish the post.
however, if as a society, you have sunk everything into long lasting, low energy consumption goods, your decline will be that much less painful as the rest of the world realigns with a resource constrained future.
while it is going to be a few more miles than that (15), i think the prius plug in could be a game changer over the next five years.
i checked on the wordpress tech support blog, and there were a large number of people complaining about rating stars on their blogs disappearing, for many older posts as well as current posts.
that’s not enough to carry four average american males (who weight 195 pounds unclothed) even with an empty fuel tank.
of course, we all benefit when the poor have access to affordable transportation to get them to work.
gailtheactuary says: september 9, 2011 at 4:56 pm i think things are kind of stalled–too many issues with summer vacations of critical people.
if saving gasoline is a goal non plug-in hybrids, such as today’s non-plug in toyota prius, require much less batter capacity than plug-ins–about 1.5 kwh compared to 16 kwh for the chevy volt, and 24 kwh for the nissan leaf.
many potential used car buyers don’t have garages for their cars, making charging more difficult if there is not a commercial charging location near-by.
the batteries would be the only thing that would need to be exchanged.
if this is correct, it would mean that more batteries would have to be produced, and this would necessitate additional resource consumption.
this influences what kind of nev/lev plugins that i am interested in, we own a prius which i’ve contemplated giving to my step daughter, and buying something “better”, either the new prius hybrid or leaf/volt.
basically they had mirrors, turn signals and such on top of the ev ranger.
the cars have other drawbacks–like limited range and the possible need for expensive battery replacement long after the warranty has expired–further cutting back on the marketability of the cars.
the difference is that electric vehicles require no gas have no tailpipe and therefore are free from emissions..
marianne says: september 19, 2011 at 3:31 pm you have a pretty strong point on fuel costs.
much like your ranger, no crash protection, no ac, no power windows, or anything that adds weight or uses extra energy.
however my polaris lev will, in fact i still use more offroad then onroad.
for example, i can estimate that if i either rode a bike or commuted with my friend using her car that i could save at most $1000 a year in fuel costs.
to greatly encourage and provide safety for neighborhood electric vehicles (nev) which are basically weatherized golf carts and human powered vehicles (hpv) such as velo-mobiles, bikes and trikes.
strange a blog called finite world wouldnt realize that cars, and the machinations of corporations and governments to keep them rolling along,are what are draining the world.
one of the current issues is the ability of the euro to stay together, because the current structure isn’t working (in part, because of rising energy prices and recession).
the rails were in miserable shape.
this would be no different than inspecting the engine on a gasoline car before resale.
and it is not just battery costs that are high–it is the rest of the car cost that is high-priced as well, especially for the volt, which runs on either gasoline or electricity (but only for 35 miles on electricity).
to bring the versa cost up to the cost of the leaf, a person would need a price of an average gasoline price of $5.07 during the three-year period, not including road maintenance costs, or $5.97 including road maintenance costs.
i recognized that the plug-in was a less effective use of battery resources than a hybrid.
even small economy cars such as the nissan versa (122hp), the ford fiesta (120hp) and the chevrolet cruze (136hp) have engines as powerful as the base engines offered with the full-size gas-guzzlers of the 1950s such as the 1952 ford customline (110hp) and the 1954 chevrolet bel air (123hp).
one thing you missed in your post is the cost of maintaing roads.
to have a 200 hp camry equivalent electric car requires 150,000 watts.
while it is possible that there will be no cars at all in a total doomer world, in descent i would say that there will be cars, and it will be what he described to me in the 30′s and 40′s.
that’s not enough to carry four average american males (who weight 195 pounds unclothed) even with an empty fuel tank.
i used to live next to a sewer lift station.
a few days ago, i read about a research group that invented a new gel lithium battery, which they claim will be better and cheaper to produce than the current ones.
without the electrical system, it is hard to transport oil (pipelines use electricity, pumps use electricity) and to refine oil.
i can see, though, that my wording is probably too strong for a very “green” audience, that is hoping for plug-ins to save them.
of course, this is a socialist idea that would never gain traction in the u.s. a (slightly) more acceptable alternative might be to give incentives to lower income buyers of second-hand plug-in vehicles.
an electric world | scoop.it owen says: september 7, 2011 at 11:25 pm factoids: toyota camry is 170 horsepower in the base model.
we know that metals costs are closely related to oil costs, because oil is used in their extraction.
but even at these prices, the cost of the lease plus the electricity for the nissan leaf is more than the cost of a nissan versa (the corresponding non-plug in electric car) plus the cost of gasoline, unless gasoline costs average higher than $5.07 per gallon over the three-year period (or $5.97 per gallon, if the leaf owner has to pay the cost of road repairs, in addition to electricity).
europe’s “soft power” influence internationally would cease (as the concept of “europe” as an integrated polity becomes meaningless).
my father following his day of work and my little league practice (in our small town), thought nothing of sitting on his front porch swing drinking a beer and talking to the neighbors who were passing by, or on their own porches.
it is also worth observing that almost no modern fiat currency monetary unions have broken up without some form of authoritarian or military government, or civil war.
so total costs (ignoring maintenance and other costs) are about 30 cents a mile, plus interest payments on debt.
that would be a much better use for the panels than running someone’s dishwasher or clothes washer (neither of which would do much without water).
we really do need 200,000 mile vehicles, if we expect to have vehicles.
20 amp breakers are typical for residences, but rewiring the house might double that.
bau will stop for whatever reason it stops–perhaps financial reasons.
speaking of which, a battery inspection program should become a routine part of any plug-in vehicle resale.
philadelphia is not, lose the grid for an extensive period and it is over (note this is not about treating the water, this is about pumping it into the city itself).
furthermore, at current pricing,it is doubtful that auto manufacturers are making money on the cars.
the analysis of mpg, cost of ownership, affordability, status symbols, etc strikes me as a bit odd for a blog called “our finite world” – more like a consumer’s report analysis.
the oil drum has more or less said they will not publish the post.
upscale 250 hp. 1 horsepower is 745 watts.
a wealthy individual benefits from a fuel efficient car much less than a poor individual does.
ideally, the poorest car buyers should get the largest subsidies to purchase the most efficient cars.
the cost is definitely rising.
i don’t expect to be able to make use of any car for more than about 5-10 years, but during that time, having a plug-in maximizes the chances of my being able to make use of the car.
second, there is technology advancement in battery technology that will provide 400 mile range probably sooner rather than later.
given the battery supply constraint (which you mention) there’s no point in nissan trying to increase volume with lower prices, since battery supply is not very elastic.
they have a cab kit to enclose the vehicle and make it more weather friendly.
for example, if a person starts with a $35,000 car and a $5,000 down payment (or a $40,000 car and a $10,000 down payment), the amount to be financed will be $30,000.
although i agree that small amounts of fuel saved by individual actions are pretty futile, it seems to me that dramatic/extensive changes in public policy could make a real difference.
i am afraid that the scenario we will be hitting is that we will lose most imported goods, and this could cause things to screech to a halt very quickly.
first, there are more efficient modes than personal vehicles, which require the transport of 3000 pounds of car to move 150-300 pounds of payload (1 or 2 passengers).
given the insecurity of petroleum based transportation, the plug-in vehicle gives me transportation security that a conventional hybrid does not.
providing subsidies (based on taxes of people less well off than the drivers of these vehicles) would seem silly if this is the main purpose for at least some of the cars.
so using 40 amps, you can put 1 hour of camry driving into a battery over a period of 466 / 40 = over 10 hours.
i also don’t like to goto church sweaty.
the alternative fuel-saving option is an efficient internal combustion engine.
thats whats really crippling us, not ‘how’ the cars are powered.
however my polaris lev will, in fact i still use more offroad then onroad.
like it or not, private cars will be part of the transport mix for the next umpteen years, but it seems that, unless there are incredible advances in electric technology, super efficient fossil fueled engines, coupled with downsizing of vehicle weight, will easily win the day.
the monthly payment will be $753.87 (assuming 6% sales tax on $35,000; 6% interest on loan, and 4 year term).
metals can be discovered and recycled.
as i’ve said before, it is very hard to have effective solutions when the problem itself is not understood.
my complaints are really with the idea that we can keep bau going with electric cars.
the electric vehicle in cheaper in europe, likely comparable in the us, and as subsidies reduce there are good prospects of being able to still remain competitive whilst shouldering their full share of taxation, and low maintenance costs are thrown in as a freebie.
i think all of the emphasis on high tech (use more coal and natural gas)
so we would be at risk of losing the oil (and probably natural gas) systems as well.
perhaps it extends oil supply a few days.
and the huge monster may keep me out of intensive care if someone on the cell phone hits me.
human bungling, cupidity and incompetence, whether governmental or private enterprise, is infinitely renewable and inexhaustible.
low emission vehicles (lev) seems to cover a pretty broad range but i’ve not actually drilled down on this – probably should.
unless these costs can be brought down, the use of batteries with lower capacity to recapture braking energy and to provide an acceleration boost, similar to the way today’s prius does today, may be a better choice, and is likely to produce a car which is salable to a wider range of potential buyers.
in the absence of such a system, i can only act in my own personal best interest, which was to buy the plug-in.
it would be better to make more high occupancy vehicle (hov) lanes than push ev too hard imho.
on a different administrative subject, the “star” rating on posts are currently messed up, (although i noticed some stars for this post suddenly appeared this afternoon).
dc says: september 8, 2011 at 2:38 am plug-in cars wont succeed,even if they appear to, because the problem with cars, as it turns out, is cars themselves.
in fact, if we save money by buying electricity instead of oil, we may ourselves use the leftover money to buy something else that uses oil.
consequently it is probably more likely that a company like tata or a golf cart manufacturer with lower overhead costs will be the successful electric car manufacturer.
but is a 2 seater, appropriate for hauling groceries, materials, and going to doctor’s appointments, no ac, no heat.
if there is a bike like with lots of regular bikes, and not too many electrics, i can see this would be a problem.
the long-term trend is probably up, because of high oil costs and lower number of private passenger autos relative to trucks, as the economy goes down hill.
and i do not need to travel a lot either although in my job a couple years ago one would travel >50% of their time.
i mentioned the cost of maintaining roads, but didn’t say much about it because the post was getting long as it was.
i am afraid that the scenario we will be hitting is that we will lose most imported goods, and this could cause things to screech to a halt very quickly.
the cost of a nissan leaf over a lifetime of 20 years (200,000 miles) is the cost of the vehicle, plus the cost of a second battery, for a total cost of $50,800, or a cost of 25.4 cents per mile.
but for really dystopian railroad transportation (freight or passenger), there is mexico.
i think i was an adult, living on my own, before i had a bike without gears.
more recently, the original vw beetle made do with 34 horsepower, even when first sold in the u.s.a. even the original ford v8 of the 1930s, praised by clyde barrow for its performance escaping from police, had only 65 horsepower.
once enought of them are manufactured, a used vehicle market will develop.
the bus stop (for between towns) went away in the 60′s, but interesting returned last year at least for going to the big city (of 45,000).
with the latest materials and coatings, the body of a car, in places where salt wasn’t used on the roads, could be built to last for 30 years.
and more than just transportation is involved, but the same vision still applies.
we have biked in a retirement community in florida that allows nevs but only within the city limit – plus some other restrictions.
the core of the solution has to be behavioral changes that transform our culture into one that requires very little energy-consuming activity in the first place, even before we start looking to efficiency.
i can tell you that everyone who is not in the far far leftist club in the bay area jokes about all the prius drivers and other hybrid and electric car drivers being smug, self absorbed types who are rude drivers.
personally, i like to think that there are still some opportunities to mitigate the worst consequences of peak everything.
given the constrained battery material supply, it’s much more effective to equipment many people with conventional hybrids than to equip a few people with all-battery plug-ins.
millions of people drive pick-ups who never haul a thing.
to those of us that follow the peak oil literature, it is well-understood that electric or hybrid cars neither help the oil depletion nor the atmospheric co2 problem and probably make them worse.
here is the renault fr website for those comfortable in french: http://www.renault-ze.com/fr-fr/gamme-z.e./renault-kangoo-express-z.e./presentation-15.html and here is the full pdf of the prices for battery hire and so on for renault uk: http://www.renault.co.uk/resources/pdf/brochures/ze_pg.pdf a bit of calculation shows that off-setting battery hire and electricity against petrol in an urban environment and allowing 3 miles per kwh to cover the extra draw from heating etc and using £1.33/litre the petrol price at maybe 8 miles/litre or so you are several hundred pounds a year better off with the electric vehicle, enough very roughly to cover the excise duty payable on petrol, so in the us it would be pretty well a wash.
gailtheactuary says: september 14, 2011 at 1:12 pm i grew up using bikes without gears.

and i do not need to travel a lot either although in my job a couple years ago one would travel >50% of their time.
it would be difficult to run the international companies without air travel.
when i was a kid back in the stone age, cars were junk after 100,000 miles.
a lot of people seem to think of electric cars, wind turbines, and energy star refrigerators that can be operated with a little less electricity than last year’s model.
it should be noted though that the first service occurs after a year or 12,000 miles, with services thereafter only at 25,000 mile intervals.
just saying september 8, 2011 at 2:00 pm you missed my reducing the horsepower to 3/4 maximum for typical driving.
of course, this begs the question then why the leaf is still so expensive.
most water treatment systems have storage at various stages, including the final product stage (various municipalities around pennsylvania seem to have a couple of days worth of treated water).
the cost of installing the system for what i expect would be a fairly small number of users would seem to be prohibitively high as well.
fragmentation of the euro would incur political costs.
the chevy volt will likely prove to fall into this situation.
or better yet, no fossil fuel use for passenger vehicle transportation.
i agree that trade would go on in the way you describe–bilateral trade, using small sailing ships, for example.
apartment building owners could theoretically add charging capability, and put in the capability to bill the costs back to the appropriate owner, but unless there are a lot of potential plug-in buyers looking for this service, it is difficult to see this happen.
mass production, using ever more complex robots, can lower production cost.
in my view, this belief is false–but this belief, as well as a number of other hopes and fears, are likely to lead a steady interest in plug-in automobiles by those wealthy enough to afford them, as well as support by politicians who want to appear to be doing something useful.
for example, i can get a brand new ford f-150 truck in houston for $21166.
again, thanks for committing your thorough and systematic analysis into a well-written article, and thanks to the readers who post insightful comments.
i own a lev (from polaris), it used lead batteries, and gets me where i need to go in rural pa, and could do the same in suburban (minus the law).
in his home town, the 1500 square foot slaughter house doesn’t exist.
that type of battery would make for a better hybrid that can get some range from the electric grid, especially if coupled to night time recharging using a simple charge timer when electrical power is generally dumped into resistors.
i probably wouldn’t have written the post, except that some of the oil drum staff members had been discussing some related material behind the scenes, so i tried to work through the details, trying to figure out what the issues really were (rather than focusing on, say, whether better batteries could fix some perceived problem).
these energy and transportation problems are not easy ones and each person the does something to aid this frail system is likely benefitting others in their community.
we only have the figures for the kangoo van at the moment, and unfortunately that does not qualify for a subsidy in the uk, so the purchase price is around 5,000 euros more than the equivalent diesel but in france they are about the same.

i know that in china, there have been problems with electric bicycles going too fast relative to regular bicycles, and there being accidents.
one thing you missed in your post is the cost of maintaing roads.
it is also worth observing that almost no modern fiat currency monetary unions have broken up without some form of authoritarian or military government, or civil war.
for instance no water for philly in a place which has water is different than no water for la in a place that is a desert.
if international finance doesn’t “work,” international trade becomes much more cumbersome.
everything else makes the problem worse.
it’s all silly and is going to kill people in car wrecks even before it kills people wasting energy on a non viable solution.
want 2 hours travel, charge it up over 24 hrs.
of course, one might ask whether bicycles might not work just as well, for the short distances under discussion.
that would be a much better use for the panels than running someone’s dishwasher or clothes washer (neither of which would do much without water).
there is also the possibility that the us’s debt problems (or those of the uk, or some other large power) could lead to payment problems among nations.
she just hated the gasoline station and wasting her money she said.
even after a collapse some parts of the world will want goods from another part, and have some other goods with which to pay for them.
from a cyclist perspective, i loved the trains in ireland – just roll your bike on the train with no extra preparation and no rush.
the issue is that none of these things will last longer than the electric grid, and that may not be all that long.
certainly we aren’t going to see the two to three cars per household that we’ve seen in the past because we all just aren’t going to have the same degree of material wealth.
equipping everyone with priuses that get double the average fuel efficiency does nothing if consumers use that to double the miles driven.
the difference is that electric vehicles require no gas have no tailpipe and therefore are free from emissions..
repairs will also need to follow major storms, with or without much traffic on the roads.
even after a collapse some parts of the world will want goods from another part, and have some other goods with which to pay for them.
food costs will skyrocket – but that also will probably drive folks to try growing stuff close to home.
for example, i can get a brand new ford f-150 truck in houston for $21166.
this is soon going to become a bottleneck and maybe a show stopper for vehicle sales other than old trucks.

all those roads, bridges, traffic cops, accidents, deaths, sudsides to oil and auto-makers.
we will be poorer in the future than we are today, but we won’t disappear anytime soon.
the train station is gone, as are the tracks, but the bed is still there.
these types of things definitely deter people like me and more moderates and conservatives from every joining the prius or other hybrid club.
i am afraid we need to wait until everything falls apart, and then we use whatever is available, which may not be much at all.
if we don’t buy the oil,the oil will not be left in the ground.
the one scenario i don’t find likely is one in which we worry about buying family vehicles that provide for 200,000 miles of motoring about in any manner that resembles today’s paradigm.
people will be willing to pay for the value they get, and the small load capacity reduces the value of the vehicles.
harvard business professor clayton christensen has written about how dominant companies can be displaced by disruptive technology because they are incapable of developing and nurturing less capable technology that competes with their current products.
the optimistic thought is that nissan is just exploiting its uniquely low battery cost, pricing relative to the competition, and reaping the additional profit.
the elites who purchase the new plug-in vehicles will then have some (a little) financial incentive to support this program and the poor would benefit.
in fact, inspecting a battery should be easier than inspecting a more complicated gasoline engine.
throughout the northeast there were plenty of manufacturers using water power to run machines in the 19th century, all of those sites still exist, i don’t even remember much of the tooling being steel, most seemed made of iron, but i could be wrong.
i think of the american bikes of the 30′s and 40′s and the modest means of the family’s that owned them, they didn’t have gears.
we only have the figures for the kangoo van at the moment, and unfortunately that does not qualify for a subsidy in the uk, so the purchase price is around 5,000 euros more than the equivalent diesel but in france they are about the same.
but for really dystopian railroad transportation (freight or passenger), there is mexico.
hi gail, although the use of bicycles on the ho chi minh trail has been somewhat romanticized and exaggerated, never-the-less, bikes moved a lot of material under very adverse conditions.
one of the current issues is the ability of the euro to stay together, because the current structure isn’t working (in part, because of rising energy prices and recession).
i think the giant sponge idea has been disproved as impractical, and also that the quantity of storage would be too small.
if you get 100% efficiency in the battery in and out, that’s the target number for a camry equivalent vehicle running 1 hour.
all those roads, bridges, traffic cops, accidents, deaths, sudsides to oil and auto-makers.
the point would be $$$ to rewire your house for 240 v (or higher) and 40 amp wires (you can’t just pound amperage through thin wires; they melt) as well as breakers, all so you can wait 10+ hours to have enough get up and go for 1 lousy camry equivalent hour.
the leaf and volt are heavy cars, with the big batteries.
gailtheactuary says: september 8, 2011 at 12:34 pm i agree that trade would go on in the way you describe–bilateral trade, using small sailing ships, for example.
it will cause a financial mess as it destroys a lot of demand by decreasing disposable income.
one reason given (by one of the staff members) was that resale value shouldn’t be brought up, because it isn’t an engineering issue.
these energy and transportation problems are not easy ones and each person the does something to aid this frail system is likely benefitting others in their community.
when i was a kid back in the stone age, cars were junk after 100,000 miles.
it would make an interesting table, taking the top 50 municipalities in this context and then their setting.
prius has had very good “lasting power” with its nimh battery, with batteries said to last up to 180,000 miles, but it is not as clear that lithium-ion batteries will last that long,according to this article.
low emission vehicles (lev) seems to cover a pretty broad range but i’ve not actually drilled down on this – probably should.
i own a lev (from polaris), it used lead batteries, and gets me where i need to go in rural pa, and could do the same in suburban (minus the law).
he also was arguing that things might get much better, cost-wise.
if this is their concern, and they can afford the high cost of a plug-in vehicle, they may choose a plug-in auto, even if the price is high relative to other cars.
this is a considerable saving, and renault should you choose to go for a maintenance contract do it for 80% of the diesel price.
if plug-in vehicles get to be any reasonable share of the total vehicles, governments will need to find a way to tax the owners to collect fees for road construction and maintenance.
fiscal confederation, not break-up our base case with an overwhelming probability is that the euro moves slowly (and painfully) towards some kind of fiscal integration.
not really needed for most of the workers, only old fashioned management styles keeps that concept alive http://www.teleworkresearchnetwork.com/outdated-management-practices-block-telework-and-flexible-work-styles/6127 (this is not so much fantasy, i and many folks i know can now work from anywhere – choosing home most often; i do not commute any more.
and you get to pay 25% more for the opportunity to endure all that.
the leaf battery is under your seat.
i am unaware if that rationale has hit the us, but would be interested if the argument is based on solid logic or wishful thinking.
well perhaps local air quality *might* marginally improve over time, but even that is in doubt since imo, car-culture will collpse long before any of the benefits of so called plug-ins even become detectable.
when i think of long lasting, low energy consumption goods, i think of things like wheel barrows, and pots and pans, and looms for cloth that can be operated without electricity.
i need to trailer 1000 lbs of feed from time to time.
