"new rail systems should serve as links to other transit modes, as is often the case in europe and japan," he says.

the article also mentions the cost of laying train tracks, but not the cost of laying and maintaining asphalt highways.
at that point the anti-car debate will be revealed for what it is truly: 'a class envy and lifestyle issue' rather than a pro-environment issue.
other issues which seem to get little press in the 'anti-car' debate are the amounts of taxes paid by car owners (likely far higher with higher salaries (likely paying much of the public transit burden) and more likely owning their own properties and thus more likely to be supporting the lion share of property taxes), not to say much of the job creation and technological innovation as a direct result of the auto industry.
while its widely recognised that car drivers are notoriously blind and insensitive to two-wheeled road users, it seems that the mental blind spot is even more pervasive.
as a result, full life-cycle emissions are  between 10 and 20 per cent higher than "tailpipe" emissions.
policies that encourage distant commuters and employers to locate themselves closer together, or to use other options such as telecommuting, walking, and cycling, would pay off many times over what efficiency and renewable energy could provide.

without a car, you are limited to how far you can walk and how much you can carry.
remember, you can fit more motorcyclists on a roadway than you can cars and if you build the motorcycles right, they are far more energy-efficient and less polluting.
if one is at all passionate about transport alternatives and pollution and actually want to do something about it, the "obvious" answer is downscale your vehicle(s).

public transport will always be neccesssary for the last two groups ,(yes, and for those on the lowest incomes), as long as our lives are so spread out as encouraged by car centric society.
unfortunately, urban sprawl in one form or another will constantly be with us.
if i relied on bus service for my daily transportation, i would need to put aside several hours a day for just standing around or sitting in a bus, and it would double the expenses.
let's say 1 in 10 want a car.
