for this reason travel insurance or ambulance membership is highly recommended for those travelling to remote areas as helicopter evacuation could cost thousands.towns with populations of 5,000 or more will have a small hospital capable of giving emergency treatment in serious emergencies, and larger towns will have a base hospital capable of routine and some kinds of emergency surgery.train travel between cities is, however, more scenic, and tourists are likely to see more of australia travelling by train than they would otherwise see, as well as cutting down on their carbon footprint.tourists are far more likely to be killed or injured as pedestrians, drivers or passengers on australian roads than all the other causes of death and injury combined.within the service sector, tourism is one of the most important industries in australia, as it provides employment, contributes $73 billion to the economy each year and accounts for at least 11% of total exports.in severe cases, particularly any kind of injury requiring microsurgery, you will need to be evacuated to one of the capital cities for treatment.this reduced indigenous populations drastically and marginalised them to the fringes of society.driving while affected by alcohol is both stigmatized and policed by random breath testing police patrols in australia, as well as being inherently dangerous.when travelling in remote areas, away from sealed roads, where the potential to become stranded for up to a week without seeing another vehicle is very real, it is vital that you carry your own water supply (4 gal or 7 l per person per day).it is also often a cost effective way of getting to regional towns and cities, which don't have the frequent and cheap flights found between the capital cities.crime rates in australia are roughly comparable with other first world countries: few travellers will be victims of crime.hotel services and hospitality are often excellent such as room cleaning services, free morning newspapers, meals to your door and a high-speed internet connection up to 24mb/s (often with a premium fee).in particular, it is safe to receive blood transfusions in australia, as donors are screened for hiv, hepatitis and many other blood borne illnesses.the operation of a motor vehicle while under the influence of prohibited drugs or alcohol will always result in arrest and a required court appearance many weeks from the date of arrest and it can comprehensively disrupt travel plans.australian police are approachable and trustworthy, and you should report assaults, theft or other crime to the police as soon as possible.
