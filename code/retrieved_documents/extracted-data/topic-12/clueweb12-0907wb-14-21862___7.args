however, one should keep in mind that "e" resources do not lead to learning if there is no associated and relevant practice for which at least some feedback is available somewhere, whether online or not (consider how effective can be the fact that my sister tells me whether my interpretation of the guitar tune watched on youtube is "good" and what she suggests i should improve, whether she is a guitar expert or not).
dokeos offers e-learning consulting based on the analysis of experience and best practices.
i should better describe things this way : "they should be able tolist main meeting management theories" (because listing is an action and i can build activities with that) or probably "they should be able tomanage a meeting" (and then imagine a role play game or any real-life based situation to practice).
truth is seldom simple but only simple ideas are usable.
(1) reminds us that e-learning is not necessarily an online activity; (2) informs us that e-learning can exist even if no dedicated course content was developed; (3) suggests that e-learning does not mean nobody sees nobody; (4) says that e-learning can exist when theory is online and practice is offline (and we can reasonably imagine the reverse situation); (5) describes something pretty obvious: many of us learn everyday in google速 without even noticing it or calling itlearning; (6)
to start with a simple approach, let's suppose we all are behaviorists and consider that learning means become able to do something new.
we are granted (2) with the opportunity to act so as to practice and improve on these skills.
publishing slides, pdf e-books, encyclopaedia articles does not mean i produce e-learning, as the criteria for e-learning does not lie in the resources i publish but in the activities i organize for the learners around these resources.

some will search google and read only.
just because i would not fly in a plane whose pilot learned this way.
but the advantage of the behaviorist definition is that it focuses on activities and feedback, hence suggesting a method for e-learning design.
the relevant activity here will probably be closer to pilot a flight simulator.
the most complex part of e-learning is due to the fact that "learning" is something complex, whether "e" or not.
(2) might include interpretation questions, categorizing questions, memory questions.
he would not get the skills.
consider also: mechanics, history of art, and more generally all disciplines dealing with visual supports conclusion e-learning is a rich and complex field of activity.
the most complex part of e-learning is due to the fact that "learning" is something complex, whether "e" or not.
designing relevant activities to drive learners from passive reading, viewing or listening to dynamically improving their skills is not an easy job.
and it is not obvious that the most sophisticated e-learning designs produce the most effective learning (consider how effective can be the simple fact that you imitate somebody playing your favorite guitar tune on youtube).
an empirical approach dokeos offers e-learning consulting based on the analysis of experience and best practices.
a third problem of the behaviorist definition is that it does not give a clear recognition to intellectual skills likeknowing history or becoming wise.
if i train on meeting management, i am not allowed to define my objectives by "they wouldknow what meeting management is" or they would "get familiar with meeting management", because "knowing" is a mental skill : i cannot check it, i cannot propose activities to improve that, i cannot give feedback on how theyknow it.
the name for it suggests that the person who learns, "the learner", is at the center of the process.

(3) might provide the learner with listening comprehensions, fill-in the gaps etc.
some others, with the same search information, will take notes, summarize, draw a mind map, produce something, explain to others etc.
people: although in variable extension, all these activities can be described as e-learning because they provide some learning experience through cd-roms or internet or telephones or any electronic device.
truth is seldom simple but only simple ideas are usable.
only the learner can decide to enter e-learning activities.
the behaviorist minimal psychology framework suggest that any information is directly or indirectly connected to the project of an action and implies that the learning process includes: information on how to do something but also practice opportunities and feedback we get (1) bits of information on how to do something.
another difficulty is that some of us will not consider themselves as behaviorists.
there are certainly much more than that and the organization could be different.
of course the criteria is a difficult one as a certain part of the intellectual activity is not immediately visible.

the 8 lines go from the most closed types of questions (easier for automatic correction) to the most open ones (the most open ones can only be corrected manually by the coach).

the topic, but also the level of the audience and the available media and e-learning softwares will help the e-learning author design the relevant questions.

look for the answer to their questions in google速; write blogs and try to clarify their own mind with the help third party comments; practice guitar by imitating youtube速 guitar experts videos; participate in sophisticated online training scenarios that take place in learning management systems (lms) where a coach accesses tracking data on their progress and helps them improve their skills through relevant feedback; play video games, serious games, online games, individually or collectively; send their productions to remote colleagues by email and expect feedback and corrections from them using for instance ms-word or open office correction features; listen to corporate management conferences podcasts on their mobile phone in the train.

one might suggest that the relevant activities should be as close as possible to real-life situations: (1) might lead to some group activities or role play.
sequencing is a matching where elements of the first set are named "first step", "second step", third step" fill-in-form is similar to fill-in-blanks but adds some graphical design to look like an existing form so as to simulate a real-life situation lab simulation can be a flash animation whose behaviour changes when user modifies some settings delineate zones on an image is noticeably relevant in medicine: delineate a cancer on a radiography for instance.
