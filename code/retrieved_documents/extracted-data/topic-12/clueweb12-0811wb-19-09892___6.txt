so as you think about your next product release, think long and hard about whether you want the trains to run on schedule or the airplane shuttle to be full.
so what  is the balance of the amount of content versus releasing for the sake of a  release?
in a software company a  product release affects everyone.
but i do have the firm belief that the only people who can deliver on this are engineers with a bit of business savvy.
while i may be oversimplifying the issue, the one that i like my companies  to subscribe to is the date driven one.
a mistimed release can severely impact  sales, cash flow, and the company.
the release runs like a train schedule, whoever makes it to the station on time is part of the release.
one of the important decisions a startup can make is how it chooses to manage its product releases.
while i may be oversimplifying the issue, the one that i like my companies to subscribe to is the date driven one.
(we generally announce new releases to promote new features we’ve incorporated recently that we think will help build sales, so they tend to be feature-driven…but i can see how a different kind of firm would prefer a date-driven focus.)reply “engineering, of course, needs to deliver product and not get distracted.”

while all of this  discussion on product releases sounds great, none of it really matters if you  do not have the experienced team that can manage them and instill the  discipline.
not because they’re incompetent, but because it’s harder than it looks, and you need to have a feel for what’s possible and what isn’t.

there are a couple of different ways to manage engineering releases.
i have to admit i was quite pleased with our new vp engineering as she put forth her methodology and process, shared below.
it seems the balance of the two is what should be considered.
everyone knows the ship date and sets their schedule accordingly to ensure that  all pistons are running as ga hits.

it  just forces the team to clarify the absolute minimum requirements necessary to  deliver the right product for the market.”

the other  release is content driven; the team knows what is in the next release, but does  not know the exact ship date.
so it also requires having the right management and  experience to balance the priorities to deliver the right product on time.
no amount of  “discipline” enforcing 80 hours weeks is going to change the laws  of physics.
of course, just because it is date driven does not mean that there isn't a highly focused theme.

perhaps the discipline of meeting a date is important for a young company but my experience is that you don’t want to go through the expense of a release unless you’re sure customer needs will be met.
in other words, are you releasing a product to meet a date, or are you releasing a product to meet a market need?

richard also has a great post on how schedules don’t make the trains run on time but people do.
we had a thorough discussion in a board meeting this week on this very topic.

reply steve-totally agree with your comment.
most importantly,  having a date driven release can get everyone at the company aligned.
i am just saying that too often companies get obsessed with filling the plane with too many features and requirements without doing the hard prioritization and analysis of what is most importantly going to make customers happy and drive new sales.
this eliminates the tension between date-driven and feature-driven approaches, as the better choice will generally be obvious once we have an answer to the question of why we feel the need to announce a new release.

sales knows when it can start telling prospects about the new product and time it appropriately so it can get customers lined up for the next quarter without delaying sales in the existing one.

5 responses to “the train is leaving the station” matt nov 20, 2004 at 6:25 am # one of the wonderful things about delivering “software as a  service” is that scheduling “releases” is purely a marketing  event…new features can be seamlessly deployed as soon as the code to  support them meets our quality and stability thresholds.
it also discourages feature creep and encourages highly disciplined prioritization.

this means marketing has to have its collateral ready, upgrade program in place, and product launch schedule set.
the release runs more like an airplane shuttle, it takes off only when full.
