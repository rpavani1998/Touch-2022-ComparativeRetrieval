following the wrong path [to an end] can disappoint many people, and discourage them from pursuing their astronomy, space exploration, and astroimaging goals.bilberry extract, available at your local health food store, is said to help your night vision, and help relieve eye strain from long guiding sessions.simple prime focus is always the best way to acheive the best images, but focal reducers can still be used effectively for wider-field imaging.remember that a shorter imaging train is always preferred because it's simply more solid, eliminating system flexure problems as you move from object to object.from over a decade of imaging experience at black forest observatory, we've found that using wide-field eyepieces for image locating in your top port, with simple push/pull secondary focusing (on all sliders and sidewinders) is much quicker and more efficient than any redundant helical focusing system (all sliders offer full aperture top port mirrors for those wide-field eyepieces).from over a decade of imaging experience at black forest observatory, we've found that using wide-field eyepieces for image locating in your top port, with simple push/pull secondary focusing (on all sliders and sidewinders) is much quicker and more efficient than any redundant helical focusing system (all sliders offer full aperture top port mirrors for those wide-field eyepieces).some will have more features, and be easier to operate, and others will be awkward and frustrating but, after reading this compendium, you will be better equipped to discern the "good stuff" from the bad.in hindsight, no barrel-nose format should have ever been used for imaging train applications because it wastes profile (except when inserted in a focuser) and can't be properly secured with one or even two thumb screws, thus the necessity to develop vse's new quad-lock system which allows the barrel-nose format to be as rigid and secure as any threaded format.in hindsight, no barrel-nose format should have ever been used for imaging train applications because it wastes profile (except when inserted in a focuser) and can't be properly secured with one or even two thumb screws, thus the necessity to develop vse's new quad-lock system which allows the barrel-nose format to be as rigid and secure as any threaded format.many people wear glasses to correct focus imperfections, and from year to year an eyeglass wearer needs to get his eyes examined and new glasses with a different rx, because your eye's focus point on your retina has changed.they always end up with eccentric or asymmetric rotational errors, because even the most accurate lathes or milling machines in the world still can't eliminate the worm's imperfections.this installation would provide comfortable right-angle viewing andcoarse focusing through your slr's viewfinder, with or without a beattie intense screen.even if you are diagnosed with 20-20 vision, critical camera focus is not achievable with your eye, because there is no such thing as perfect 20-20 vision.the software's capabilities are near unlimited, and the unsharp mask feature is very valuable for sharpening sky images.this type of device looks spectacular to the novice, but in reality is quite dysfunctional when trying to acquire your sky object and achieving final critical focus.
