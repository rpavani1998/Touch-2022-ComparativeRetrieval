in almost every category, planes and trains are far better for the environment than individual passenger vehicles.for example, the san francisco bay area's electric train-transit system known as bart is responsible for substantially less carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions per passenger mile than any plane.stand-by power can account for as much as 20% of home energy use.long commutes and trips to the mall from oversized houses out in the sprawl create environmental dilemmas no matter what the mode of transportation.yes, that a train might not be the ideal solution, and, yes, it could be a boondoggle in the name of environment if it doesnâ€™t have enough riders or requires intense construction efforts or is too dependent on fossil-fuel energy.it seems fairly obvious that if a train has few riders, it may well be burning more fuel per "passenger mile" and spewing out more pollution per mile than a packed airplane.so it all depends on the kind of train, what type of infrastructure is built to support it, where it's located, what kind of energy it runs on, and how many passengers ride.but comparing methods of travel gets a lot more complicated when you go beyond engine energy and look at the total environmental impact of everything from obtaining all the raw materials needed to manufacture everything involved, and to build and maintain roads, rails, and airports.after all, new york city's carbon footprint is only a third of the national average, thanks to its compactness, transit system, and apartments that average half the size of new houses in the suburbs.a ban on building in the middle of nowhere might be more important than the transportation we choose to get to and from it.but the fact that a commuter train, whether boston's or san francisco's is so much better than a car, makes it the best option for such areas.in fact, as these researchers point out, all comparisons can change drastically if energy sources, technologies, and demographics change.save both energy and money by unplugging your devices, or put them on a power strip that you can turn off when they are not in use.what these guys do is go way beyond comparing energy use and greenhouse gases from vehicles themselves, and look at the energy and pollutants (like sulfur dioxide, nitrous oxide, and carbon monoxide) generated by processes from the entire life cycle of planes, trains, and cars and the infrastructures that support them.but boston's green line light rail is responsible for slightly more carbon dioxide than midsize and large aircraft, but way less nitrous oxide.
