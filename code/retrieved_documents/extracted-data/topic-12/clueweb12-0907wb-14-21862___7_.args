we are granted (2) with the opportunity to act so as to practice and improve on these skills.although in variable extension, all these activities can be described as e-learning because they provide some learning experience through cd-roms or internet or telephones or any electronic device.designing relevant activities to drive learners from passive reading, viewing or listening to dynamically improving their skills is not an easy job.but the advantage of the behaviorist definition is that it focuses on activities and feedback, hence suggesting a method for e-learning design.people: although in variable extension, all these activities can be described as e-learning because they provide some learning experience through cd-roms or internet or telephones or any electronic device.the behaviorist minimal psychology framework suggest that any information is directly or indirectly connected to the project of an action and implies that the learning process includes: information on how to do something but also practice opportunities and feedback we get (1) bits of information on how to do something.publishing slides, pdf e-books, encyclopaedia articles does not mean i produce e-learning, as the criteria for e-learning does not lie in the resources i publish but in the activities i organize for the learners around these resources.look for the answer to their questions in google®; write blogs and try to clarify their own mind with the help third party comments; practice guitar by imitating youtube® guitar experts videos; participate in sophisticated online training scenarios that take place in learning management systems (lms) where a coach accesses tracking data on their progress and helps them improve their skills through relevant feedback; play video games, serious games, online games, individually or collectively; send their productions to remote colleagues by email and expect feedback and corrections from them using for instance ms-word or open office correction features; listen to corporate management conferences podcasts on their mobile phone in the train.however, one should keep in mind that "e" resources do not lead to learning if there is no associated and relevant practice for which at least some feedback is available somewhere, whether online or not (consider how effective can be the fact that my sister tells me whether my interpretation of the guitar tune watched on youtube is "good" and what she suggests i should improve, whether she is a guitar expert or not).the behaviorist minimal psychology framework suggest that any information is directly or indirectly connected to the project of an action and implies that the learning process includes: we get (1) bits of information on how to do something.if i train on meeting management, i am not allowed to define my objectives by "they wouldknow what meeting management is" or they would "get familiar with meeting management", because "knowing" is a mental skill : i cannot check it, i cannot propose activities to improve that, i cannot give feedback on how theyknow it.one might suggest that the relevant activities should be as close as possible to real-life situations: (1) might lead to some group activities or role play.(3) might provide the learner with listening comprehensions, fill-in the gaps etc.and it is not obvious that the most sophisticated e-learning designs produce the most effective learning (consider how effective can be the simple fact that you imitate somebody playing your favorite guitar tune on youtube).an empirical approach dokeos offers e-learning consulting based on the analysis of experience and best practices.
