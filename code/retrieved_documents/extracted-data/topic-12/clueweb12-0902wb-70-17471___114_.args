our courts have established that people in this country have the right to travel and associate without being monitored or stopped by the government unless they have been convicted of committing a crime or are suspected -- with good reason -- of having committed a crime.they have ruled that we cannot set up roadblocks and checkpoints to stop everyone who passes just to catch the few who have done something wrong, or to find the few who are suspected of intending to do something wrong.these policies are hurting the economy by decimating tourism.because of this lack of choice, the id order creates an envioroment that is diametrical to the right of all citizens to be “free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this movement".even though the above ruling strengthened thereasonableness of having the option to show id or submitting to a secondary screen, it did not weaken the right of all citizens to be “free to travel throughout the length and breadth of our land uninhibited by statutes, rules, or regulations which unreasonably burden or restrict this movement.being required to show an id to the screener or risk being denied the right to travel and the right to free trade is losing essential liberties.setting up a checkpoint at airports to stop everyone just to find the few criminals is un-american, and probably unconstitutional.keep in mind this will greatly inconvenience people, but especially those who are deaf, mute, has religious beliefs, and those who are autistic.note the court affirms it is the right of citizens to travel uninhibited by rules, regulations that are an unreasonable burden or restrict movement.this initiative is simply a way for us to better enforce the no-fly list and ensure the safety of the traveling public.lack of options and a punitive nature makes the new id order a burden that unduly restricts travel.and it's another excuse for tsos to badger and harass innocent people who forget their id, now that they can be officially denied travel based on a subjective judgment of "cooperation."the better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different states in this union,the free inhabitants of each of these states, paupers, vagabonds, and fugitives from justice excepted, shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several states; andthe people of each state shall free ingress and regress to and from any other state, and shall enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and commerce, subject to the same duties, impositions, and restrictions as the inhabitants thereof respectively, provided that such restrictions shall not extend so far as to prevent the removal of property imported into any state, to any other state, of which the owner is an inhabitant; provided also that no imposition, duties or restriction shall be laid by any state, on the property of the united states, or either of them.denial of access is now punitive in nature due to the fact the passenger is required to genuflect in order to be allowed a secondary screening instead of the presentation of an id.no unconstitutional restraints on anyone's right to travel is imposed by the challenged statutes and regulations.
