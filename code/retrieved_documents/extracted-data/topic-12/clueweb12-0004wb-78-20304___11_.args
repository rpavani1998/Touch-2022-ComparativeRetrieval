particularly for itineraries where the cities aren't far apart, the train may still be your most economical and even your quickest choice.discount airlines like ryanair and easyjet have made jetting around the continent quicker and cheaper; in fact, ryanair often offers sales with fares as low as 8 gbp (about $13.36 usd).in most cases you'll arrive at a train station near the center of each city, with quick, easy connections by subway to hotels and sightseeing.a few other caveats: beauvais is probably the least convenient airport for paris-bound travelers, requiring a shuttle bus ride of over an hour to get into the center of the city.while that's significant, keep in mind that overnight trains are an option; these allow you to save time (and money on a hotel room) by traveling while you sleep.though easyjet.com, ryanair.com and raileurope.com are relatively easy sites to use, it often takes a bit of manipulation to get the itinerary you want, especially when connections are involved.we tested fares on easyjet, ryanair and rail europe to see who had the lowest price, the most convenient connections and the quickest journey.easyjet may offer the cheapest fare for the first leg of your trip, but the next leg may be better served by train.the runner-up: rail travel comes in at a distant second place, at $481 for a eurail select pass, which allows five days of train travel in three countries and is several hundred dollars cheaper than booking point-to-point tickets.tips for finding cheap airfare finally, ultra-cheap flight offers aside, beware of the many hidden costs that could significantly boost your price tag -- everything from baggage fees and credit card surcharges to the price of transferring from one london airport to another.even if you do net an incredibly affordable flight, government taxes and fees bump the price up to at least $25 or $30.easyjet offers direct flights for each leg of our itinerary, so booking was a breeze, and the travel time was a little less than six total hours in the air.keep in mind that flights may look shorter on paper, but you'll also spend more time going through security and transferring into the city you're visiting than you would for a journey on the rails.on ryanair, there are so many that the airline has put together a handytable so you can see at a glance what you'll be charged for checked bags (with higher rates during the summertime and december holiday "peak" periods), online check-in, priority boarding, even purchasing a flight (you'll pay an "administration fee" of 6 gbp unless you make your booking with a mastercard prepaid debit card).the discount airlines, meanwhile, fly from stansted, luton or gatwick,not heathrow -- so be sure to allow plenty of time to transfer between airports if your itinerary so requires.
