rocket science it ain’t (though it helps when you’ve got trusted friends bothered to do the co2 maths).
i just don’t go for the idea that the fact that we lose in the end means we shouldn’t try hard to adapt and thrive (qualitatively, not necessarily quantitatively).
most travel agents and other sources of information are insanely biased towards air travel, so sites like this are hugely valuable.
i know it looks like hard work to anyone who prefers to find a perspective and stick to it, but it’s like breathing for me.
to me, endless worrying over the tiny ripples we make in moving through the world is truly futile.
« exploring the megalithic mind in malta bjm in europe » travelling without planes so, having signed up for the exciting metageum conference in malta this november, the question of travel arises.
i don’t think any butterfly i thoughtlessly gassed as a child died in vain, all three of them before i decided it was cruel hobby.
mark is clearly someone who would be doing this with or without an impending climate crisis: “many people would rather not fly, or like me, simply prefer a more civilised, comfortable, interesting, adventurous, romantic, scenic, historic, exciting and environmentally-friendly way to travel.”
the industry claims it can reduce its emissions by means of new technological developments.
jim bliss, my ex-engineer friend whose head for maths makes me dizzy, on moving to dublin last year, sat down to work outhow much worse it would be if he flew to london rather than taking a coach.
it’s great that people like john gray are reminding our progress-obsessed christian-hangover tech culture that in the end we are “as straw dogs”.
they farm fungi, raise aphids as livestock, launch armies for wars, use chemical sprays to alarm and confuse their enemies, capture slaves.
i’ve little truck with people who take action against climate change as some straw to hang on to to save their illusions about our supposed mastery over nature.
the people i know who dedicate a great portion of their waking lives to campaigning for such limits also apply this sense of collective morality to their own actions.
my trip to malta may inevitably end up entailing air flight, if for no other reason than no ferry services seem to operate in november (i’m a good swimmer, but not exceptional).

not so, unfortunately, with air travel: … every other source of global warming can be reduced or replaced [...] without a serious reduction in our freedoms.
it’s geared towards british travellers, but does include information on travel within other countries that people originating elsewhere may find crucial.
i think the knack is knowing what our real job is in the scheme of things.
we should just shut up and let it happen, before we no longer have the resources to escape the earth or before a huge meteorite hits us.
like the gigantic fruiting body we are, we should ripen and disperse into space and the singularity that awaits us.
i was talking about being true to what you believe and not fudging the issue to serve another master, since it’s only yourself you’re fooling, no-one else.
merrick just did some more diy carbon calculations, and worked out that – using aviation-friendly estimates – “every minute you’re on a plane is the same as a day’s worth of your electricity”.
we have nature to thank for the template.
the best we could do after all these millennia of evolution is probably to jettison little vials of our dna out into deep space, out of danger of the earth being no more.

obviously you value a megalith conference in malta more highly than your views on climate change.
we’ve traded a martian stepping stone to the stars for suburbs, endless toing-and-froing, and an oil-guzzling military system with which to kill each other over the last scraps of the oil we’ve wasted.
we are already fossils in rocks.
as for the rest, it’s not noble it’s mostly just posturing.
ants… we do seem more like a social insect (or virus) than monkeys.
honestly, i feel like punching people who beat themselves up over this, just to save them the trouble.
merrick just did some more diy carbon calculations, and worked out that – using aviation-friendly estimates – “every minute you’re on a plane is the same as a day’s worth of your electricity”.
real ants move bits of dead leaf from a to b and keep the aphids down.
bringing all our options to the table, seeing that it’s all futile and acting well anyway, the perception of futility as theground for acting well – that’s my position.
my darker wide-view is that fossil fuels were life’s ticket to go there – and we’ve pretty much blown it.
a great book i just read quotes lewis thomas as saying ants are “so much like human beings as to be an embarrassment.
i guess you might go by plane, though, just to annoy anyone who thinks that personal responsibility counts for anything… more wasted energy, though (in more ways than one).
and generally that’s because i’ve spent a little time while awake to think the shit through and find a good balance between moral ideals and day-to-day life.
the fact that this philosophy’s most famed branch, the slow food movement, itself began in italy as a reaction to fast food makes me even more inspired to take my time getting to malta.

it’s only like a plant withers and dies once it has spread its seeds.

i for one have found it a joyful thing each evening for the past few weeks to see the international space station burning brightly as the sun sets.
george monbiot the singular nature of air travel in this respect means that we just have to travel less by air.
the industry claims it can reduce its emissions by means of new technological developments.
a certain smugness in putting all one’s wine bottles in the recycling bin holds off for another day real thought about who we are and why we are here.
if we can make our way briskly past the noxious climate change denial industry (and associated amateurs), accepting that this stuff is actually happening and that our actions have consequences, we usually come to the arguments for “tech fixes”.
the people i know who dedicate a great portion of their waking lives to campaigning for such limits also apply this sense of collective morality to their own actions.
i don’t give a damn what people do, but i don’t like to see intelligent people lying to themselves.
yes, we each do our bit, every ant has its purpose.
but in the end i can’t help but recognize that only fools think they know for certain what the future holds – which to me means acting now in a way you think will contribute to a better future, even though that future (like the planetary collapse one) isn’t certain.
george monbiot the singular nature of air travel in this respect means that we just have to travel less by air.
if you want to go to malta to look at rocks because the rocks down the road aren’t good enough for you, just go and forget paying lip-service to “responsibility”, because if you really cared one way or the other about the damage your journey would cause you simply wouldn’t go.
we ants move a few thoughts from one place to another and imagine we are masters of the earth’s fate.

it may be foolish to think you know the future, good point there, even for one who has invested his time reading oracles, but it is even more foolish to think that we ants are affecting anything at all.
really, your punch would be a waste of energy cos i’m losing no sleep over this.
perhaps the ant we crush in the bathroom, afraid it is the advance scout of a future infestation, had the job of making us feel guilty so we would reappraise our attitudes towards insect life.
what’s important is the new seed.
if we destroy the planet to send our dna out into the universe then i expect we will have done our job.
i agree about about space (though obviously not enough to have been keeping up on the iss – must look out for it!).

but it may be possible to include a pleasant jaunt through italy as part of train travel most of the way, and discovering the best way to do this is made all the easier by this brilliant website: the man in seat sixty-one the hobby site of “career railwayman” mark smith, it details concise and helpful information for anyone who – for whatever reason – wants to travel without flying.

anyway, i thought you’d be the train-across-the-continent, catch some good italian cuisine along the way kind of guy.
