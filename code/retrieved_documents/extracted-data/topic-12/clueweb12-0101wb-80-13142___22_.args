therefore, from a real world useability standpoint, the ssd would be much better experience, because it improves in the areas where you have high expectations, and only falters in areas that you already have low expectations.in order to keep things light, ultra portables generally have tiny batteries and are built out of very lightweight materials - resulting in poor battery life and a hardly durable feel.at the same time, having a good keyboard, a killer form factor and keeping weight down were all more important than with a regular notebook.and finally we have the issue of price; the culmination of all of these sacrifices is a very light weight, very portable device...that also costs a great deal of money.they are downloading email often from remote locations so having 3g capability would be mandatory.in order to keep power consumption down, smaller screens with cramped resolutions are the norm in the ultra portable space.the durability issue is compounded by the notebooks being very thin, which only makes them feel more likely to break.this thing has to feel small in your hands when carrying it around, it has to feel just as natural and painless as carrying a paper notebook around.ultra low voltage cpus are generally preferred here and it’s only recently that we’ve seen ultra portables really get faster than 1ghz.since writing and basic internet access were the main duties of this machine, things like hard disk space, having an internal optical drive and absolute performance weren’t really concerns; running notepad or textedit just doesn’t require much.i can see the mba working for people who have the money to spend on a third computer (second laptop) and for anyone who does a lot of typing but needs a laptop that can be carried around.you give up performance because the cooling and power requirements of a high speed cpu just aren’t possible to satisfy given the form factor and weight requirements of an ultra portable.the screen is identical and the footprint is virtually unchanged.the overall thing with this device is that in order to achieve a baseline of functionality you are conceivably carrying around an ethernet dongle, possibly the super drive (probably not in college, but most definitely if you are traveling) a usb extension cord, plus some sort of 3g device if you really want to be mobile.the mba really does require a companion pc in order to assure the buyer that he/her can reinstall the os if problems arise.
