of course, we all benefit when the poor have access to affordable transportation to get them to work.anything that allows what liquid fuel supply we have to go farther, such as supplementing oil powered cars with cars powered by electricity, allows more people to drive cars, and to drive them further.unless these costs can be brought down, the use of batteries with lower capacity to recapture braking energy and to provide an acceleration boost, similar to the way today’s prius does today, may be a better choice, and is likely to produce a car which is salable to a wider range of potential buyers.taking all factors into account, the best solution would be to equip the most needy people with the least expensive vehicles.the electric vehicle in cheaper in europe, likely comparable in the us, and as subsidies reduce there are good prospects of being able to still remain competitive whilst shouldering their full share of taxation, and low maintenance costs are thrown in as a freebie.with expensive batteries, it just means a return to smaller and lighter cars which in the end will provide the same utility as current large vehicles.the elites who purchase the new plug-in vehicles will then have some (a little) financial incentive to support this program and the poor would benefit.i think all of the emphasis on high tech (use more coal and natural gas) solutions has kept people from thinking about solutions at a human scale level, that can really be maintained for the long term.i would argue that what electric cars do is allow us to raise our demand for other sources of energy (mostly coal and natural gas–sources of supply which are more elastic), so that we end up burning those sources faster, in an attempt to allowmore people to have cars, without exhausting our liquid fuel supply, or to allow people who have carsto drive them further.cheap fuel is nonrenewable and in increasingly short supply.it will cause a financial mess as it destroys a lot of demand by decreasing disposable income.that type of battery would make for a better hybrid that can get some range from the electric grid, especially if coupled to night time recharging using a simple charge timer when electrical power is generally dumped into resistors.if sales prices remain at their current levels, and the government is not able to keep up subsidies, monthly payments to buy the cars will put the cars out of reach for many buyers.the most efficient concept in urban environments is personal rapid transit (prt), which uses a 1500 pound pod on an electrified monorail to carry up to 6 passengers, a ratio of 250-1500 pounds of vehicle per pound of passenger (“v/p”), compared to 750-300 v/p for a typical passenger automobile.especially in view of the fact that a turbo charged diesel vehicle ends up arguably emitting less pollution whilst maintaining all the advantages of the traditional petrol engined car.
