a most important consideration is that, coupled with the production of "green" electricity, affordable electrified, passenger rail systems would add tremendous improvement to our air quality.train travel requires huge infrastructure compared to air travel and with a population as small and diffuse as that of canada, it cannot compete with air.8000 km of new track would equal a whole new opportunity for entrepreneurs to provide service to the population.road travel especially only pays about $5 billion in gas, consumption and road taxes annually, but is funded nationally and provincially to the tune of more than $16 billion across the country.to run a similar service for double or triple the number of passengers would require an enormous investment in infrastructure: double- and triple-tracking, more trains, more stops, split-second scheduling.because the trains 'tilt', they are able to take curves faster and because they have a lower centre of gravity, they are more stable.passengers would need to consider their journey as important as their destination -- an opportunity for fun, relaxation, and socializing.it's extremely effective and also saves the company immense amounts in travel time and costs.you could get speeds of close to 5000 kmph, all powered by electricity, at a tiny fraction of the energy required by jet aircraft.oil will be too scarce or too expensive, and you can't run a plane on electricity, as you can a train.by using tilt trains, one can decrease journey times by up to 40%.finland's high-speed link between kupio and helsinki (500 km) serves a sparse population of less than a million, but nevertheless manages to run 5 times a day - 7 hours by car, mostly in the dark, or 3 1/2 hours by train.even at an average speed of 200 km/h it would take 25 hours to reach toronto from vancouver and the cost of laying and maintaining the track would be astronomical considering it would have to be laid across the rockies and the canadian shield.the reality that regular cargo gets priority over passengers should come as no surprise, the cargo was paid for long ago and regularly and there is no passenger rail service anywhere any time that was not subsidised by cargo shipments.it's actually cheaper, in money and time, to take the train than to fight traffic out to an airport, park, get on the plane, and then reverse the process at your destination.
