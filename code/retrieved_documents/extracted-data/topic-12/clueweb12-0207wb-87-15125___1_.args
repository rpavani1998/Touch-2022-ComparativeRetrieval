policies that encourage distant commuters and employers to locate themselves closer together, or to use other options such as telecommuting, walking, and cycling, would pay off many times over what efficiency and renewable energy could provide.hence, the best way to reduce emissions from these modes of transportation would be to increase fuel efficiency and push for renewable fuels.roadways can be repaired incrementally without significant impact on the function of the transportation system which in turn has a lower over all cost to the system and it's users.the emissions generated by car travel increase by nearly one third when manufacturing and infrastructure are taken into account.if we can eliminate all forms of poverty and tribalism, then we can start talking about supplying people with things like clean water, sanitation , and personal transportation.there are plenty of parks within walking distance of anywhere and excellent transport links throughout the city for a low monthly fee.the researchers found that travelling 1 kilometre on a nearly empty bus during off-peak hours emits eight times more per person than taking the same bus at rush hour – suggesting peak-time commuters may suffer, but they do less harm to the environment.i envision a world where cars can no longer be the disproportionate whipping boy of of all that is purported wrong in the world and become an effective part of a diverse set of transportation options.more than half of the life-cycle emissions from rail come not from the engines' exhausts, but infrastructure development, such as station building and track laying, and providing power to stations, lit parking lots and escalators.highways (and i admit i'm guessing here) may have higher utilisation rates because they handle multimodal traffic (passenger vehicles, goods transport etc.) are on the clock whereas rail transport has relatively low transportation density (i.e. a few trains widely spaced) and is only efficient, as this article points out, during peak load.it is further interesting how these numbers will change as passenger vehicles start using greater amounts of non-carbon sources of energy and more of their components and infrastructure are increasingly recyclable.in my personal opinion, a backyard is the only way to healthily raise a child in an insecure and risk-laden world - and no parent should feel that they need to give up career dreams or goals to constantly supervise young children.rail track has onsistently degraded because of a lack of investment and a lack of redundancy.public transport will always be neccesssary for the last two groups ,(yes, and for those on the lowest incomes), as long as our lives are so spread out as encouraged by car centric society.setting up a public transportation system that only a small proportion of the population uses could generate more emissions than it cuts, he adds – especially if trains and buses are not well connected.
