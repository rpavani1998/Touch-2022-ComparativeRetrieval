seattle is like many cities in that we had competing rail companies who built competing passenger rail stations.
the seat width is as wide as the first class airplane ticket as well.
i went online and bought my tickets with a promotion code (never pay full price for amtrak, there's always a promo code somewhere).
i would think that vancouver bc to san diego would be one such line as well as boston to miami and chicago to nyc.
amtrak is not crappy rail travel, let me just say that right now.
to give some background before i start i have to say that i've logged about 15,000 miles on amtrak in the past and about another 5,000 to 10,000 miles on other train systems all over the world.
i'd estimate roughly 45 inches between seats or roughly equal to a first class airplane ticket.
the amtrak superliner experience is drastically different.
i started noticing business people taking the trains, grannies seeing family, workers commuting and more.
if you want more of a personal experience (and more costly) you can snag one of the attendants as they walk through the car and get a reservation to eat in the restaurant.
i remember times when i was passing through portland and had a layover when we'd run down the street to the burger king and buy a couple of $1.39 whoppers and take them on the train.
i like the rhythmic rocking motion and i like the fact that i can do other things on them.
a short walk to the chinatown station put us on the red line light rail.
the lower level also houses additional luggage storage although if i were you i'd lock my bags if i couldn't monitor them.
longer journeys the planes speed overcomes it's inefficiencies.
there's very little difference between first class and second so unless the ticket prices are close we always ride second class.
if the superliner could get up to speed or stay at top speed longer it could equal driving and still be more comfortable.
i spend a lot of time in europe and especially france where high speed rail has all but killed air travel and i have tosay that i love trains.
on arriving to portland we exited the always nice restored union station.
the lower level also houses additional luggage storage although if i were you i'd lock my bags if i couldn't monitor them.
the old lady's only waiting room may be made into a cafe or restaurant.
the tgv is an all business experience more like an airplane ride (but not so walmart).
the plane leaves at 6:30 and our comfort suites is going to start breakfast at 4 so off to count sheep i go.
each seat has power plugs which are a godsend and a quick stroll through the cars will show many people taking advantage of them with laptops and pods everywhere.
the whole process takes 15 minutes tops from the time i decide to take a train and get one one.
the seat reclines about 2-3 times more than an economy airline seat and a second lever props up a leg support and a third pops up a bar for your feet.
the tgv experience is about getting to your destination as quick as possible with relative comfort.
the restaurant car is complete with white table cloths and nice food but you have to be fast because there's several seatings and if you don't get a reservation you're limited to the bar car or bringing your own.
my first amtrak trip cost me $177 from washington to nevada round trip.
speaking of which if you get bored in your oversize seat you can take a walk.
however there are 4 trains a day from seattle south which isn't wonderful but it's good enough that you can choose a schedule.
immediately upon entering the train you will notice that you have an insane amount of room in your coach seat.
the idea of taking a taxi to some airport where i have to take my shoes off, scan my bags and then wait at a gate to be crammed into a tin can with a bunch of other half sick travelers coughing on me and babies screaming is very very unappealing.
when you fold down your tray you have to then slide it toward you about 6 inches before you can put anything on it.
a good bus can't compete with a bad train in my book.
downstairs from the observation car is the food counter where they have the usual cardboard pizzas and ampm quality hamburgers.
that was cheaper than any plane ticket then.
each seat has power plugs which are a godsend and a quick stroll through the cars will show many people taking advantage of them with laptops and pods everywhere.
thats right, a person is standing there with a map and a market to scratch off where he wants you.
i'd estimate roughly 45 inches between seats or roughly equal to a first class airplane ticket.
with amtrak having a ticket is only the beginning.
so in this country where we're afraid to pay one cent in taxes unless it's put to good use bombing a small country to protect our civil liberties we should think about just using rail for these high profit lines.
there is about 12 tables where you can sit an eat your food before returning to your seat.
and i'm not sure they can fix it is the train routes are generally slow and not very frequent.
because they're double decker the second level (the main level) doesn't have to deal with train wheels so there's 37 rows of seats in the car which is amazing considering the space between them.
inside the station they have a media board showing the future plans which include tossing out the water stained roof tiles, restoration of some of the marble pillars, a new walkway up to street level and a restoration of the outside of the building which will open up space for businesses etc..
i say do whatever to bring us up to the same level of japan, china, france and germany or leapfrog them.
i'm fairly impressed by how much light rail portland has put in compared to seattle.
let's start by the ridiculous and painful proces s of going from the idea of taking the train to actually walking on.
we've managed 1/5 the amount of mileage and only after two decades of talking about it and it still doesn't really go anywhere.
there used to be a beautiful wooden ticket booth which is no longer and a lady's waiting room which doesn't get used.
the coast starlight also has a bar/lounge car with observation deck which is where i love to just sit and read and watch the scenery pass by the wraparound glass windows.
now i can fly for less than that.
on the amtrak you feel like you can take as much time as you want to get where you need to be and for good reason, you have to.
because of the amount of time it takes to get to airports, get checked in and get your bags and get away makes any journey under 6 hrs subject for replacement by high speed rail.
but i think it could be profitable.
i measured 5 softbound novels from my upright setback to the one in front of me.
the plane leaves at 6:30 and our comfort suites is going to start breakfast at 4 so off to count sheep i go.
tgvs have about as much room per passenger in economy as airplanes have in business class.
i realized that normal people took the train.
for about the first day of the trip i felt a bit embarrassed because i always thought people who took mass transit were poor uneducated folks with little other choice.
the stairway from the street is closed off and the street level parking lot is a hangout for bums and trash.
when you fold down your tray you have to then slide it toward you about 6 inches before you can put anything on it.
the train ride goes by very casually and without disappointment.
it doesn't take a genius to figure out that is a lot of room.
the one nice side effect of this process though is you don't have conductor coming through to punch your ticket.
i remember times when i was passing through portland and had a layover when we'd run down the street to the burger king and buy a couple of $1.39 whoppers and take them on the train.
a modern train with right a way could do canada to mexico in 10 hours or less and would be full the whole way because unlike an airplane they pick up people on the way.
my perception may be skewed a bit but in france i show up at the train station 15 minutes early (or whenever to be honest) and walk up to a kiosk to buy my ticket after which i walk onto a train.
speaking of which if you get bored in your oversize seat you can take a walk.
union station got funding to renovate because it is used for the new light rail station.
my first amtrak trip cost me $177 from washington to nevada round trip.
the lower level is for first class and sleepers in addition to the bathrooms which also will surprise you.

seattle is like many cities in that we had competing rail companies who built competing passenger rail stations.
however, they're rarely on time, they're not fast and they're not always cheaper than flying.
the train would probably cost more.
before people jump on me about taxes and subsidies let me say one thing, the tgv system in france makes money.
i spend a lot of time in europe and especially france where high speed rail has all but killed air travel and i have tosay that i love trains.
you now have to stand in a long line to turn it into a boarding pass.

once you have your boarding pass you need to move to a new line which is waiting to get on the train.

i just spent 4 hrs on the coast starlight for the first leg of our journey so it's fresh in my mind.
king street station across the street is just starting the process of restoration and the venetian piazza st. marks style clock tower definitely looks better as does the new roof tiles.
the whole process takes 15 minutes tops from the time i decide to take a train and get one one.
the stairway from the street is closed off and the street level parking lot is a hangout for bums and trash.
you now have to stand in a long line to turn it into a boarding pass.
the ter (inter region) do not make money and need to be subsidized.

for about the first day of the trip i felt a bit embarrassed because i always thought people who took mass transit were poor uneducated folks with little other choice.
i just like riding trains.

however there are 4 trains a day from seattle south which isn't wonderful but it's good enough that you can choose a schedule.
a kiosk that can assign seats on purchase would replaced this entire thing.
also there's the feel element.
more trains, a bit more speed and keep them full so the ticket prices could be lower and i think we'd have a winner.
a modern train with right a way could do canada to mexico in 10 hours or less and would be full the whole way because unlike an airplane they pick up people on the way.

on a less idealistic dreamy note amtrak would do well with newer rails and more right of way.

what's worse is they actually chipped molding from the walls so they could plaster over it to get a smooth surface.
not only do you have way way more room than on an airplane the train gets going quickly because they can load all cars at the same time.
the interesting part is they built them across the street from one another.
i like the rhythmic rocking motion and i like the fact that i can do other things on them.

theoverhead luggage compartment has enough room for a rugby team and if that's not enough there's more space at the car entrance.
