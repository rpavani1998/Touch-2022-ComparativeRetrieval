compared with other modes of travel, family trips in efficient cars offer considerable eco-opportunity.moreover, unlike planes—which have much higher occupancy rates—motor coaches and trains are often underused and may offer what amounts to a carbon “free ride.”on a per-passenger basis, a car with four seats occupied is roughly four times more environmentally friendly than it is when the driver travels alone.another important factor that affects the eco-impact of plane trips is what class you’re traveling, since first class seats take up more room onboard and are therefore responsible for a greater share of the flight’s total emissions.the high fuel economies and low tailpipe emissions of the most popular hybrid models have made the technology synonymous with eco-friendly engineering.a 500-mile plane trip (non-stop, coach) emits slightly more than 300 pounds of emissions per passenger.while they are often overlooked when it comes to vacation travel, buses and trains can also make great sense from a carbon perspective, as they are among your lowest-emission options, especially on shorter (less than 500-mile) trips.in short, if an efficient hybrid car is used to move a family of four, it’s the most eco-friendly travel option around.and, perhaps surprisingly, a direct coach flight is a better travel option than driving solo in a hybrid if the trip is longer than 500 miles.per-passenger emissions from a 500-mile trip in a bus or train amounts to 84 and 215 pounds of co2, respectively.efficient hybrids, such as the toyota prius, have earned their right as environmental darlings of the passenger car market.the amount of carbon dioxide emissions from an airplane trip depends on numerous factors, including the type of plane(s) flown, how many layovers are taken (since takeoff and landing activities have their own sets of emissions), and how many miles are ultimately logged in getting to your final destination (which is affected by how far out of the way any layover stops might be).for trips with only two travelers, hybrids are still a pretty good option, coming in second only to buses.but, for solo trips efficient hybrids fall down to the middle of the pack—especially on longer-distance trips where lower-carbon options exist such as the bus or train.for a 500-mile trip, that amounts to 540 pounds of co2 pollution.
