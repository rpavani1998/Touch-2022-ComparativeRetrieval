appropriate use of pain relief eases the physiological strain and makes of a speedier recovery with fewer complications; this is amply documented in repeated scientific studies.animals, and people, recover faster and with fewer complications from surgery and injury if their pain is controlled.the reality is that pain killers are essential for a good quality of life for many people who deal with chronic pain.pain is an important feature of evolution and an entirely natural informative tool and as long as it does get out of hand and become debilitating any animal can and does use it effectively to help in the healing process.some animals do not show any symptoms of pain and their activity remains normal after procedures.but as time wore on people discovered on their own that his methods had problems and although they were used in thousands of barns later studies showed that they were in fact rather inhumane because it restricted the cows movements and often lead to severe injuries and even death, certainly losses in animal productivity.in defense of that clinic, it would be a violation of pharmacy laws — it would be illegal — for them to dispense this medication to anyone not their patient.which would matter more if, number one, hiding pain wasn’t a survival strategy for animals in the wild, where being impaired increases your chance of being dinner for another animal, and number two and most importantly, study after study in humans and animals hadn’t shown that recovery time is shortened and complications are lessened when pain is controlled.taking pain seriously as a medical issue is not about work ethic or values.it prevents re-visits and possibility of pain developing without having the “waste” that well managed time… also, country vets are more likely to be dealing with someone who is themselves more experienced with animals and vet care than the average urban pet owner.sorry, no. just because modern technology has given us new options doesn’t mean we can’t still get from the east coast to the west coast by well-stocked wagon train (and it’s been done, fairly recently); that the wagon train will still work, however, doesn’t mean that choosing to do that rather than taking a plane is “practical” or “pragmatic.”until management of livestock for food consumption is done humanely, regulation and enforcement how animals are being managed in their households is standardized, changes in the sheltering and animal service standards are consistent, this is just another mess to take up court time.the moral judgment of an individual who takes or fails to take pain seriously is absolutely dependent on their viewpoint, education, lifestyle, cultural issues, etc.these people have no less empathy for their animals than you do but have developed different strategies to deal with it that have proven themselves successful over an extremely long period of time.there has been a lot of work done on pain management by the glasgow university and they have produced a way of evaluating an animal’s pain based on their behavior.
