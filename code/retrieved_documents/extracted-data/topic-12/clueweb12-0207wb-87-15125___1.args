"new rail systems should serve as links to other transit modes, as is often the case in europe and japan," he says.
more than half of the life-cycle emissions from rail come not from the engines' exhausts, but infrastructure development, such as station building and track laying, and providing power to stations, lit parking lots and escalators.

while its widely recognised that car drivers are notoriously blind and insensitive to two-wheeled road users, it seems that the mental blind spot is even more pervasive.
as a result, full life-cycle emissions are between 10 and 20 per cent higher than "tailpipe" emissions.
policies that encourage distant commuters and employers to locate themselves closer together, or to use other options such as telecommuting, walking, and cycling, would pay off many times over what efficiency and renewable energy could provide.

buses turned out to be the most sensitive to how full they were – those with only five passengers were less efficient than cars; even large suvs and pick-up trucks.
i also believe we should encourage far more use of two wheeled vehicles in the form of scooters and motorcycles which give you most of the economic freedoms a car does if you build your infrastructure to support them.
the finding also underlined that electric trains and cars can contribute to emissions if the electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels.

without a car, you are limited to how far you can walk and how much you can carry.
remember, you can fit more motorcyclists on a roadway than you can cars and if you build the motorcycles right, they are far more energy-efficient and less polluting.
if one is at all passionate about transport alternatives and pollution and actually want to do something about it, the "obvious" answer is downscale your vehicle(s).
the occupation level of a vehicle is an important but often-overlooked factor, says chester.

in my personal opinion, a backyard is the only way to healthily raise a child in an insecure and risk-laden world - and no parent should feel that they need to give up career dreams or goals to constantly supervise young children.
yes, i know with a bicycle you can go further but you can carry less unless you're willing to go to the hassle of using a trailer but most people aren't being to do that because they aren't twentysomethings and they really don't care about bicycles.
in comparison to cars on roads and trains on tracks, air travel requires little infrastructure.
setting up a public transportation system that only a small proportion of the population uses could generate more emissions than it cuts, he adds – especially if trains and buses are not well connected.
so it is illuminating to notice that in the initial paper the only "cycle" mentioned is the life-cycle.
as a result, full life-cycle emissions are between 10 and 20 per cent higher than "tailpipe" emissions.
the need to have children will naturally mean the need to have a backyard and personal vehicle - which means a suburban infrastructure.
"although mass transit is often touted as more energy efficient than cars, this is not always the case."
having looked at the state of the world i am rather relieved we don't have any as they have only a small chance of a decent future considering the state of the planet and the number of inhabitants we will have in a few years time with all the constraints on resources that come with this.
public transport will always be neccesssary for the last two groups ,(yes, and for those on the lowest incomes), as long as our lives are so spread out as encouraged by car centric society.
unfortunately, urban sprawl in one form or another will constantly be with us.
if i relied on bus service for my daily transportation, i would need to put aside several hours a day for just standing around or sitting in a bus, and it would double the expenses.
so, i would advocate a car use if the car can be made more efficient than public transit because of the economic, personal, and societal freedom it brings.
highways (and i admit i'm guessing here) may have higher utilisation rates because they handle multimodal traffic (passenger vehicles, goods transport etc.) are on the clock whereas rail transport has relatively low transportation density (i.e. a few trains widely spaced) and is only efficient, as this article points out, during peak load.
news true or false: taking the commuter train across boston results in lower greenhouse gas emissions than travelling the same distance in a jumbo jet.
for a typical ride that costs 2.70...3€ (double rates at night), you could go three times the distance on a car on the same money with no wait times, no annoying co-passengers, faster and with the ability to carry your groceries somewhere else than on your lap.
so, due to a combination of economic condition, attitude of self-entitlement and the upper echelon being as far out of touch as they are, we're set to be in a bad way as a species in the coming decades...that is if we make it that far with psychopathic extremist countries such as n. korea and iran and their scientific devolution.

those that don't have access to cars directly are usually volountary abstainers (in cities ,for instance, they are unneccessary and innefficient due to clogged roads), children and the elderly.
aside from that - people live in suburbs because it's a nicer neighborhood to live in - kids or no kids.

now maybe some of those kids will end up being exceptionally smart and a boon to society at large and thus the species, but all too often these days the children of such parents suffer from poor nutrition, poor education, poor supervision and poor health, becoming vampires on the system that was only supposed to help them get a foot under themselves, not support them indefinitely (i'm all for giving a helping hand, but let's 'teach them to fish instead).

hopefully, people will leave the suburbs once their children have left -- thus keeping a low-density -to- high-density recirculation, as necessary - hopefully leading to some reduction in sprawl as only those who need a backyard will have one - perhaps a tax-incentive scheme to push out childless backyard owners.login and reply report this comment mon jun 08 04:02:08 bst 2009 by alex except, of course, everywhere outside north america kids grow just fine in urban or rural environments, and american suburbs are seen by foreigners as some kind of cemetery for the living.login and reply report this comment mon jun 08 04:18:08 bst 2009 by dr rob strange!
