these unthinking people are behaving irresponsibly endangering the lives of innocent people both those in the speed boats but also that of other water users (ie fishermen & boaters) in their vicinity .in many cases i suspect it would force many of the owners into having to obtain the necessary training.where errors or inaccuracies occur, we will endeavour to correct these as early as practicable afterwe are notified.had life jackets on either - it's an accident waiting to happen only it will not be an accident - such an event implies the element of chance - being in the wrong place at the wrong time - this will not be the case in these situations it is reckless behaviour akin to dangerous driving .alternatively, you can donate by laser, credit card or paypal if you're feeling generous or appreciative.to a previous poster, mandatory insurance is not a way of improving standards, its merely a way of driving up the cost of insurance.even then, the response may be inaccurate, misleading ...this forum is provided as a service by iwai to its members and others interested in the development and use of of our waterways.if the operator is aware of the excessive power and uses it appropriately ok, but in a lot of cases these boats are pushed to the limit most of the time ( or until the operator has his/her near death experience )- buying a lifejacket - checking a lifejacket - repairing a lifejacket - boating code of conduct - boating education - certificate of competency - boat surveyors - iwai shop - waterside walks - keep the children happy - waterside restaurants - angling/fishing - nature - official - discussion forum - photo gallery - opinion polls - friends of the ulster canal + links to agencies, clubs etc.website feedback, errors, corrections etc. are always welcome.this is an archive - these posts likely contain out-of-date-information all content is copyright Â© the inland waterways association of ireland - all rights reserved.this archive was auto-generated from emails - its also possible that important information may not have been transfered into the archive.i would argue that the examiner who issues the powerboat cert should be the decider, that person may feel a certain 12 year old has a better grasp of the issues then a 15 year old.information is provided by iwai in good faith.
