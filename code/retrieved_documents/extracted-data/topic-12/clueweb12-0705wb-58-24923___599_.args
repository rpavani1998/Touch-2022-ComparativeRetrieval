nuclear energy would provide the cleanest form of almost unlimited electrical energy allowing us to charge our vehicles.the batteries are almost entirely recyclable, and the power they store is generated far more cleanly and efficiently than gasoline can achieve.gas guzzlers both use oxygen and emit toxic gases, but not ev:s. that means serious savings in closed space ventilation costs, and also increased safety in accidents in tunnels.another idea is to use "powered guideways" that would isolate the vehicles from pedestrians and regular traffic, and fully automated to provide convenient, safe, rapid and efficient transportation between cities.cars are also otherwise safe too, there has been real life accidents already with roadster and those have shown that they are safe cars to drive.nuclear, hydro, wind, geothermal and solar are all clean sources of electricity.with almost instant recharging you should be able to recoup a significant amount of spent energy through the dynamic braking system, they have a longer life than any current battery and they're more efficient.for safety sake, it would need to properly vent the engine exhaust, have reliable electrical connections to the car, avoid overheating the fuel tank, and safely contain the fuel in case of an accident.multiple studies that measured actual exposure to low frequency electromagnetic radiation found no correlation between exposure and cancer risk, so it seems likely that something else about that particular area under the power lines was causing the leukemia, perhaps related to the local environment or lower income.they have relatively high energy density, are relatively cheap, easy to maintain, and have no capacity degradation over time.this will also make it more attractive for homeowners to opt for larger solar systems that would reduce or eliminate the use of commercial electricity in their home.but yes, the real solution will come when affordable, and especially cheap, batteries are developed that are truly practical in filling all the needs of a typical driver.there have been huge amount of scientific research going how to make roads better and traffic more safe, but most of them just aren't viable because it just costs too much.added benefit to this could also be the use of a heat exchanger to aid cockpit/battery heating in cold climate conditions which would aid reducing the demands on vehicle batteries as it could provide the power to it's own electric fan, boosting it own efficiency.the energy needed to power that refrigeration is several times greater than the small amount of power saved through improved motor efficiency, it would be a big step backwards.
