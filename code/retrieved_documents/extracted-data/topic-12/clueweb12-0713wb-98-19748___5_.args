many remain out of work, though some are taking jobs in asia and the middle east, where the shortage of pilots is most severe.the aim is to teach students from the beginning the skills they need to fly in a multicrew jetliner.alteon will continue to monitor their progress for several years to determine if their performance is as good as, better or worse than first officers who come up through the usual pilot-training process.students will spend much more time in ground-based simulators and far less time actually flying a plane -- and that has critics worried.china, india and many other countries that have a lot of new planes coming from boeing and airbus, as well as from the manufacturers of smaller regional jets, are not able to train enough pilots at home.we are trying to provide a program that is not only equally safe (as pilot training programs today), but more safe.the mpl program established by icao requires students to receive 70 hours of actual flight time, 10 hours of which must be solo.instead of accumulating a couple of hundred or more hours flying in a small, single-engine plane, the brisbane students will spend a lot of their training in a boeing 737-800 simulator.as the boeing co. and airbus sell more planes than ever, many of those planes are headed to parts of the world where airlines are desperate for pilots.from cessnas to simulators training pilots to fly commercial jetliners is difficult, expensive and time-consuming.about a month ago, six cadets from china started training that will land them in the right seat of a commercial jetliner in about half the time it takes today to be trained as a first officer.the middle east and africa will need an average of 1,205 pilots a year.the government there finally drew up a code of conduct that requires pilots to give adequate notice before leaving for another airline.in parts of asia, poachers have disrupted air travel.u.s. airlines laid off more than 10,000 pilots after the 2001 terrorist attacks.
