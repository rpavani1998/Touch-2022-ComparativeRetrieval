the co2 emissions from road transport are so high, the report says, that the best way to make a serious impact on it is to persuade people that having a high carbon footprint is as socially undesirable as drinking and driving or smoking in public.to improve passenger numbers, travel needs to be far cheaper (compared with road and plane travel), but more importantly far simpler with the previous principle of walk-on reasonable fares and a united railway system and fare structure.the car remains, the car produces a massive income through fuel duty, taxation, etc, giving a very good reason why the motorist will remain a target, and why providing a real alternative is not a financially attractive option to any uk government.this will free up capacity on the conventional network for the many more local & commuter trains we will need.put freight back on the railways; congestion on roads would be dramatically reduced, there'd be faster and safer journies, less traffic on arterial routes and less fuel used.the imeche doesn’t soft-pedal the difficulty of the task, either; it says that considerable investment will be needed in new infrastructure, including high-speed routes similar to the new channel tunnel line, following the east coast and west coast lines and segregating passenger services from freight trains; new rolling stock with wifi at every seat, to make rail travel more pleasurable and productive, and to ensure more frequent and reliable services; plus urban planning regimes encouraging high-quality development of the areas around railway stations.the extra time spent travelling would be acceptable given reasonably filled trains and regular, on-time services.while it’s very seductive to think of standard rail travel being an equivalent experience to business-class rail travel but a quarter of the cost, it’s going to take more than environmental arguments and extra taxes to get people off the motorway and onto the train.several recent studies have shown that manufacture, support and disposal have a far more serious effect.people should then be convinced, through information on the smaller emissions profile of rail travel and by new pricing policies, to take the train where previously they would have driven.the psychological connections of car travel and personal freedom are very strong in this country.car hire is simple, cheap and reliable.we are undoubtedly a small country compared say to the us, but that country long since accepted that to get from a to b was a necessity, and being a large country, they have an air-infrastructure that works, but only because the astute yanks have made it very simple to fly & drive.in terms of passenger numbers, they are high, and as already acknowledged nearly at the absolute maximum capacity that can be achieved.the simple fact is that, thanks to successive governments not investing in public transport over the years - and therefore not providing viable alternatives to the car - the public has become used to driving.
