this is a forum for bonding with your fellow catsters about the traits, quirks and idiosyncrasies of your favorite breed.however, i have read that russian blues become attached to one or two people and are really loyal.coop and felix are also both alike in the sense that they both are/were "one-parent cats" -- following me all over the house, showing me tons of affection, and generally just trying to involve themselves in whatever i'm doing.now the people we got him from had him for 7 years and he seems to be adjusting very well to new parents.he likes to have his belly rubbed and will "paw" us if we stop petting him and he isnt done yet.he's very shy, he hides when anyone comes, he even hides from my husband sometimes.he greets us when we come home and follows us around the house, talking to us.a few people he'll sniff after while and be okay with, but others he'll hiss at and hide from.he will only let me pet him and cuddles with me, and has finally recently started warming up to my husband.i was always afraid that maybe he was abused as akitten, but i thought i'd ask if it's normaly for most blues.felix would often hide when people came over to the house, and most of the time, coopurr does the same.he hasnt been around anyone else but us yet, so we will see if he gets shy and hides my posts | my page | msg me | gift me | become friends [notify] watch ask a cat lady photo slideshowshe gets startled very easily.i guess my "blue" doenst have a problem with new people.our blue really doesn't like it when people come into the house.
