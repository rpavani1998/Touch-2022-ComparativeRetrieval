furthermore, cats are great natural predators and left unchecked will decimate a bird population.also, parasites and spoiled food are two large contributors to weakened feral animals and inability to reproduce.this keeps cat populations at a much lower natural limit, as the cats will still keep other cats out of a territorial area but cannot produce new kittens that keep a colony growing and then go out to form new colonies.sick animals without treatment have a lower chance of survival.rape culture is the idea that our culture minimizes the damage of rape, marginalizes rape victims, blames the victims for being raped, and gives rapists the idea that they can safely get away with rape.others are killed through accidents, such as catastrophic intersections between the animal and vehicle vectors (i.e., run over).a stray cat in a suburban neighborhood may live very happily, as there are not many natural predators around (except humans).it's not logical to claim the feral cat population will decline because of adoption, when there are many perfectly ready cats already available for adoption at any given moment in time.if you don't care about any other wildlife then ignoring wild cat populations is a great way to see most of it decline.also, the breeding availability of feral cats is more limited than you assume due to competition for territory, mates and resources.they were never fed, but were still healthy and happy.wild cats don't have many diseases that kill them or prevent them from mating.the survival rates of feral cats are probably good, but they're not perfect.but, if there is a good food supply (rodents, birds, snakes, etc), they will reproduce more.if there are too many cats, not enough food, some cats die of starvation.
