dogs are social creatures, pack animals who naturally band together with their fellows (canine or human) against an outside threat.yet hollywood family fare has been so dismal for so long that, despite its shortcomings,cats and dogs still comes as a breath of fresh air.but there’s a particular breed of cat fancier who looks down at dogs precisely for qualities like their obedience, loyalty, and desire to please, explicitly preferring the fierce independence and proud impassiveness associated with cats.unlike shrek and doctor dolittle 2, both of which relied on low humor and off-color jokes,cats and dogs is good, clean fun, only occasionally slipping in material that might seem crass in another film but somehow works here.for all that we may appreciate cats for being what god has made them, the fact is that we ourselves are happier and better if we are, to put it bluntly, more like dogs.cats are naturally solitary creatures, each of whom tends to want to be the king of his own particular hill.and, in a story of anthropomorphic dogs and cats, especially if they’re battling one another, it’s more natural to identify with the dogs.the zany slapstick violence is in the classic old warner-brothers cartoon tradition, and much of the humor stems from familiar animal traits.that would give dogs an edge in the housepet wars; but an evil white persian named mr. tinkles (voiced by sean hayes) has a clever scheme that would give cats the ascendancy by instead making everybody allergic to all dogs.more importantly, it lacksspy kids’s engaging characterizations and winningly positive view of parenthood and family life."dogs," winston churchill once observed, "look up to us, cats look down at us, but pigs treat us as equals."there are no pigs in cats and dogs — though, if there were, i doubt they would be inclined to regard the film’s insipid human characters as their peers.in cats and dogs, this battle plays out in cartoony 007 or spy-vs.-spy scenarios covertly carried on out of sight from unsuspecting humans.that’s enough to qualifycats and dogs as a pretty decent family flick in its own right.by now, of course, we’ve all seen animals talking through the magic of digital post-production and high-end puppeteering, in movies from the classicbabe to the less-than-classic eddie murphydoctor dolittle flicks.
