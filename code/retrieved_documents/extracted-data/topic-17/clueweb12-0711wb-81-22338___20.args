this keeps cat populations at a much lower natural limit, as the cats will still keep other cats out of a territorial area but cannot produce new kittens that keep a colony growing and then go out to form new colonies.
starvation is definitely a limiting factor, at least in suburban areas.
most credulous people are actually quite cunning when it comes to selecting facts.
sounds more scientific that way.
since she was a pet, she had readily available food and water.
a really feral cat cannot be made a pet.
also, the breeding availability of feral cats is more limited than you assume
a stray cat in a suburban neighborhood may live very happily, as there are not many natural predators around (except humans).
if you actually have to force someone to have sex with you, you're raping them.
some may be trapped and sent off to the pound and subsequently euthanized.
i'll admit, it's easy to think that when you see the phrase abused.
share twitter facebook i wonder how many loccats that would end up being.
that could include... food supply.
that group doesn't count as "rape" in my book.
my brain hurts from trying to read that.
even basically "[citation needed]" doesn't help there, because some piece of bs (with statistics or not) that's been bouncing around for 30 years, can be a bitch to track to the actual source.
the groups posting these figures may be giving you a number somewhat too high but they are not as far off as you and other people thinking of statistics in simple terms seem to think.
i did lower the number of litters to 3 to account for some variance in how often a female cat could get pregnant.
i thought the chupacabra had spread all around the world, but they're still good at hiding themselves.
the cats that we domesticated were comfortable laying around the house (the porch was enclosed, but the doors were left open).

feral cats are rarely killed by coyotes, even if there were enough in urban populations to matter.
i heard [wikipedia.org] that the african elephant population has tripled in the past six months.
one might even end up with the idea that it's an inherently wrong idea, that we in no way have a rape culture.
the coyote population won't decline.
the best solution is to trap cats, spay/neuter, and then release them.
the resulting increase in blood flow would explode the mosquito quite nicely.
the environment needs more protection than it currently has.

lies, damned lies and cat statistics 175 posted by samzenpus on wednesday august 18 2010, @05:53pm from the nine-lies dept.
the problem with the "lies, damned lies, and statistics" argument is that it leads people to conclude that all statistics are invalid unless they happen to agree with our political proclivities, which is far more dangerous than bad numbers floating around out there.
i think the case can be made that people who accept sensationalist statistics without sufficient media literacy to understand the various biases involved in poorly conducted studies may, in fact, be only using 10% of their brain.
that way they continue disease, most likely.
the low end of your range is thus not realistic.
every time i smashed one fat with blood, i relished the idea that i had just killed a female mosquito who was about to lay thousands of eggs.
you could get close, and if they were curious, they'd let you touch them.
as a bonus, without cats to eat the coyotes would starve.
wild cats don't have many diseases that kill them or prevent them from mating.
there is something extremely patronising, or condescending, which presumes that people cannot be motivated by subtle or nuanced arguments – every problem doesn’t have to directly affect 98.43% of the population to count.
that varies tremendously by their local environment.

not every animal is born perfectly.
you can get a feral cat to take food from you but it's never going to be a pet.
some proponents even suggest that anyone challengi [feministing.com] the fundamental problem is that most people are credulous morons.
publication a cites official report b (see the politicians using them above,) which in turn has a footnote pointing at newspaper article c, which points to out-of-print book d, which even if you find a copy and read it, in turn points out to some study that's behind a paywall, and if you got even there, you find out it's really a meta-study quoting the numbers published in yet another article e. most people will give up somewhere along that chain, and assume it's actually a valid and proven claim.
the most "friendly" was that we could then get them fixed.
i've had a lot of cats over the years, and have paid attention to their behaviors.
all it took was for one guy to do a little digging into the stats, find the body of literature that criticized the methodology of that one source, and campus rape became a joke to half the community.
community, i found this column onhow a fabricated statistic takes on a life of its own interesting.
parent share twitter facebook exactly - and some bogus claims just feel too true to be false.
very ironic, considering that tfa was about how bumper sticker phrases spread so much bs.
as you are the first to have noticed my .sig, i'll give you the opportunity to tell me where it is from and what it relates to.
i'd have used more text, but the .sig field is limited.
the survival rates of feral cats are probably good, but they're not perfect.
it's that it isn't as outrageously bad as the stats that are being claimed.
the statistics can be dramatically swayed by who paid for the study to be done.
especially given that a number of women still do the "no means yes" game for testing mates.
" the unsterilized offspring of a cat will '...result in 420,000 cats in 5 years,' sounds like an opportunity for a new fast food chain.
and again, try to do that without sounding like a ct-er inventing reasons not to trust those guys, and without falling into "tl;dr" range either.
if you don't care about any other wildlife then ignoring wild cat populations is a great way to see most of it decline.
effectively shitting all over your home is not a wise decision, closing your eyes doesn't make it stink any less.
starting with the humane society of the united states' (hsus) claim that the unsterilized offspring of a cat will '...result in 420,000 cats in 5 years,' the author looks at other erroneous numbers, where they came from and why they won't go away."
if we were still using ddt there'd be no songbirds.
litters per year: 0 to 3 litter size: 1 to 8 so, using a changing multipler for newborns of year1= 0 to 12 offspring year2,3,4,5 = 0
if one cat turns into 420000 over 5 years, then if a single cat was abandoned or escaped 15 years ago in the usa, there should now be 13.8 quadrillion offspring accumulated, or 13.8 peta-cats if you will.
furthermore, cats are great natural predators and left unchecked will decimate a bird population.
of course, i suppose they could have been lying to me "no" means "no", you dope.
however if you have been trained to reject all statistical evidence, you no longer have any reasonable tools for sepa i'll rush to publish this statistic and start a new one on rodent population, stay tuned.
and that 20% "forced sex" study includes women who chose to have sex even though they didn't want to.
others are killed through accidents, such as catastrophic intersections between the animal and vehicle vectors (i.e., run over).
fact was that they'd just been a bit too subtle for my simple mind.
under ideal conditions i suspect you could breed a heck of a lot of cats from a single female ancestor in 5 years.
i actually rtfa), but according to the maths that i do from the unfashionable side of my mother's basement, the actual number of offspring after 5 years starting with a single unspayed female cat is zero.
so once you manage to get centenarian, your chances to ever die drop very low, and you're almost immortal!
we are not responsible for them in any way.
even people who wouldn't just believe it the first time, start falling for it when they hear it from 10 different sources as common knowledge.
one of them had a litter of kittens, and the population went up to about 7, but dwindled down on it's own to 4, which then became 3 when one of a healthy female cat is going to have a littler every year.
they'll also likely have access to food and water left outside for pets.
presumably, i'm told (many years ago) that if you pinch t i had a friend who would clench his muscle until the mosquito was getting ready to disengage, and then would release.
to get an idea how bogus that was, not only didn't the calculated numbers add up to "less likely than being killed by a terrorist" (they even admitted they made that up for sensationalism sake), but it was based on the critically flawed assumption that a woman would _only_ marry older men.
making ludicrously wild claims that simple logic will negate may get some attention initially, but in the long run it will damage your cause a lot more than it will help it.. real world example of self-limiting cat populations: barn cats.
in 5 years, 1 unspayed mouse will have 60,466,176 offspring.
" i should derive a bullshit statistic on how many pulitzer prize winners don't know the difference between the plural "women" and the singular "woman", though i'm pretty sure it is christie keith's own error in fai oh, drug policy is the proverbial low hanging fruit there.
the real reason though was so we didn't have wild animals fighting with our domesticated animals.
basically at some point some falsehoods have taken off so well, that you don't even have to be a gullible moron to just take them for granted.
if there are too many cats, not enough food, some cats die of starvation.
the area was almost infested with large snakes.
[cats-or-dogs.com]share twitter facebook now, if one starts with two cats however, the number could well be higher...
i worked with a phd student doing research on a specific strain of fiv unique to the country i live in - you should've seen some of the feral monsters she dissected.
maybe the number quoted is theoretically possible, but if this were as much of a problem as the statistic implies, we'd have been buried in cats long ago.
there are a ton of "x is better than y" or "a is 10% more scalable than b" pseudo-facts thrown around, that everyone just repeats and nobody questions them.
it's not just that people will believe some bs or another.
it practically implies that you have a scient "sort of how like in the article it wasn't just "cats sometimes have more kittens" or "cats kill a lot of birds" that got to be circulated into near impossible to debunk, but catchier stuff with numbers, like "an unspayed cat can produce 42,000 cats in 5 years" or "a cat can kill a billion birds".
especially almost nobody in management who heard it in some it-for-managers ragazine _and_ from the nice salesman using it to sell his snake oil.
yeah, if we're doing a top of domains where it happens the most, i'll have to admit that drug-related politics would be way up there.
if you're a dorf [magmawiki.com], you don't even need to leave.
and that was in a rural area, where easy access to food is harder to come by - in an urban or city environment a cat really doesn't need your handouts as much, because there is so much garb feral are wild.
i don't think they are - my numbers assume only that the cats get pregnant, not from who.
it's not logical to claim the feral cat population will decline because of adoption, when there are many perfectly ready cats already available for adoption at any given moment in time.
if that isn't what they wanted, that is their fault for not being clear.
sorry, we use all of it, nature isn't wasteful, the premise that we only use a fraction was invented before modern medicine/science, over a century ago.
to halt computing is to shackle the mind very ironic, considering that tfa was about how bumper sticker phrases spread so much bs.
and those mosquitoes would in turn breed and lay thousands of eggs
or you can take the myth that a woman who's not married by 35 is even less likely to marry than to be killed by a terrorist.
" and even if you got past that, you often find that a) they have the same gross misunderstanding of statistics as the journalists who mis-represented it in the first place, so good luck getting them to see why it doesn't actually say that, or b) you need to first teach them what an equivocation or amphibology fallacy is, before they're even equipped to understand why the study doesn't actually say what they think it says c) you'd need to first teach them a lot about the psychology and pitfalls of polling, i.e., that basically you can produce vastly different results from the same people and to essentially the same question, by just exploiting the tendency of people to say "yes" more than "no", or pick the answer which sounds more agreeable, or just pick the first one more in multi-choice polls.
the statistic counts an unf with cats that i've had, i've noticed a few different behaviors with food, including kills.
but, if there is a good food supply (rodents, birds, snakes, etc), they will reproduce more.
sick animals without treatment have a lower chance of survival.
a friend of mine had "barn cats" they were mostly domesticated, but not fixed.
there are an abundance of natural controls at work there.
serious polling companies know and compensate for that, but a pr agency can deliberately exploit that to skew the results.

if you get them really, really early as kittens (a few weeks old) you can, but after that - forget it.
they lived in the barn, and were perfectly happy catching mice.
lets assume that a cat can get pregnant after it's 0.75 years old (what i've read online says 6-9 months), that pregancy takes a quater of a year (seems to be an overestimate) and that each litter produces four kittens (the soruce i've read says 3-6 is normal)two of which are female (guess).
that's right, i saw you smoking that marijuana.

to give only the upper end of that range is misleading but not as bad as your range, which hides a real problem by saying that there may not be one.

they usually don't care much, but it's food so they eat it.
it's just not true - the washingdon post even managed to track down where the falsehood originated, and there's avery informative snopes entry [snopes.com] on the topic.
a bunch of warm fuzzy kittens running around make good snacks for birds of prey.
unlike hiv it spreads via bites and scratches btw.
not to mention shelters have to kill plenty of cats that are not feral to begin with, because there aren't even enough people to take cats simply abandoned...
in the absence of any other limit the population will grow to the limit of the food supply.
more seriously, it's not that feral cats are no problem or that it's a problem to just ignore.
a stray cat in a wooded area will have less of a chance.
and sometimes even if you make it all the way to the root source, you'll have trouble convincing anyone that that common knowledge is false.
i used a spade on one i found in my garage last month.
without a billion songbirds to eat those 420,000 cats would starve.
plus, as they say in tfa, eventually it even gets picked by some newspaper, or repeated by some politician trying to support some bill, and it kinda becomes official.
better to vasectomize the males.

my studies show that only about 80% of people are credulous morons, while 50% of people are moronic intellectuals.
if we can't believe that one cat can produce 420,000 more cats over the course of 5 years, then maybe we shouldn't believe any other statistic.
while that's still horrendous (as you point out) it's lower, and therefore sounds much better, almost like the actual rate had dropped by half, when the first number was just bullshit.
