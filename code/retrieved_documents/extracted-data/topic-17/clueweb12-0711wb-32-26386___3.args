but you get the idea- everyone would likely enjoy an animal name badge.)
lots of one animal name badges have personality, but the adorable pewter kitty tooth fairy name tag is really something!
i have customers with name badges from the magic zoo that are over 4 years old and the magnetic back is still in fine shape.
by far, my customers have chosen the magnetic backing over the pin backing.
very harmonious given the stereotype cartoon view of dogs constantly chasing after cats at every opportunity.
if you prefer silver over gold for accessorizing, i have the name plate itself available in stainless steel (silver tone).
i think this expressive pewter dog cat combination name tag would also make a wonderful gift for your favorite veterinary professional whether that is a veterinarian, veterinary technician, practice manager or assistant.

if you look closely at that little cat face, she has quite a winsome expression and the dog looks like a friendly sort as well.
by far, my customers have chosen the magnetic backing over the pin backing.
the pin backs are just not as long lasting, plus they put holes in your scrubs, jacket or shirt.
