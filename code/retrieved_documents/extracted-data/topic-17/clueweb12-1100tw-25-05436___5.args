dogs are tougher nuts to crack, mostly because breeds vary widely in size, vocal range and heart rate.
they can learn to recognize a sequence of notes, but if you transpose the notes to a different key, so that the sequence uses the same relative notes but the key is different, they can't recognize the relationships between the notes anymore.
by contrast, they calmed down and became unusually social in response to a "tamarin ballad," which incorporatedhappy monkey tones and a slower tempo.

dogs really do understand us best against the conventional wisdom that music is a uniquely human phenomenon, ongoing research shows that animals actually do have the capacity for music.
to animals, human music falls into that grating, unrecognizable category.
a tunepitched too high or low sounds grating or ungraspable, and music too fast or slow is unrecognizable as such.

"we have some work-in-progress where we've transposed music and put it in the frequency range for cat vocalizations, and have used their resting heart rate, which is faster than ours," he told life's little mysteries.

"people assume that if they like mozart, their dog will like mozart.
[dogs play the piano in new video] indeed, some dogs do appear to respond emotionally to human music.
my prediction is that a big dog might be more responsive to human music than a smaller dog such as a chihuahua," snowdon said.
but no matter how well composers perfect their dog, cat and monkey songs, the animals will probably never appreciate their species-specific music quite as much ashumans appreciate ours.
if they like rock music, they say their dog prefers rock.

"we have a very human tendency to project onto our pets and assume that they will like what we like," said charles snowdon, an authority on the musical preferences of animals.
