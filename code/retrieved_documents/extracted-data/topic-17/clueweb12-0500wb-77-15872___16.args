in fox's experiment (1975) with various wild and domesticated canines, there was a surge in aggressivity in male jackals and wolves at the onset of puberty which increased until it peaked at 2 years.
w w when it is raised in isolation in a closed environment (0.2 m² cage) the flight reaction does not develop; instead only inhibition or fear-provoked aggression develop (fisher, 1955; fuller, clark, walker, 1960 in scott and fuller, 1965).
male chihuahuas raised by cats until 16 weeks of age demonstrate preference for the presence of cats, and submission - or fear - in the presence of dogs (they also show no reaction to their reflection in a mirror).
puppies raised in surroundings poor in stimuli ("stimulus-poor puppies") and placed for the first time in a highly stimulating environment at 12 or 16 weeks are inhibited (fear) and search less complex environments.
a bibliographic study confirms there is a phylogenetic and/or epigenetic tendency for pre-puberty sensitization.
this reflects cyrulnik's (1991) remarks that the brain becomes atrophied when [an animal] is raised in sensorial isolation, and it develops more than average in an environment of hyperstimulation in noise, affectivity, odors, tastes, sight, etc.... neurobiological studies have showed that prolonged precocious isolation was responsible for long-lasting structural or functional cerebral modifications .
the cognitive process it entails leads to a dog'santicipating harmful situations that exist only in its mind (in a way, fear of being attacked) and thus behavioral strategies (defense mechanisms: flight, aggression, inhibition).
the acquirer (when he receives the 7-9 week old puppy) must then respect these socio-ecological conditions - he must limit the space available when the puppy is not under human control and provide the adequate elimination medium (why not a large litter box in an apartment?) placed at the right location (at least 2-3 meters from where the puppy eats and sleeps).
when put on the defensive a cocker's bite is "softer" than that of other breeds tested (basenji, terrier, beagle, sheltie).
in another station the mother was taken from the breeding kennel when her puppies were 5 weeks old; these puppies were not submissive to adults when they were first placed with the rest of the group at 12 to 16 weeks.
the identification phase at birth the puppy has not an innate recognition of members of its species; in a way it does not know it is a dog.
in this single-breed kennel (little variation in genotype) in a relatively deprived sensorial environment, there was a high degree of phenotype variation with, nevertheless, a large percentage (more than 50%) of dogs displaying inhibited behavior (more than 75% of the dogs were anxious).
he also accustomed wolf cubs to humans, then isolated them: in this case there wasde-socialization (instability of precocious socialization).young animals need continuous reinforcement.
enriched puppies are systematically dominant in the presence of stimulus-poor dogs.
food hierarchization is average in cockers and beagles with no predominance of either sex.
it no longer has the right to greetings, licking and other social attentions given by the other dogs.
this is probably linked to the social species' innate need for contact.
this is because in a group, the dominant members react and put the young dog in its place each time it tries to compete aggressively, barring its access (satellisation) to socially invested areas and sexual partners.
the lack of human contact between 3 and 12 ± 2 weeks fosters the development of fear/wariness of humans (feral dog).
elimination behavior (1) is preceded by sniffing around, probably in search of typical odors (urine, feces, chlorine, ammonia, etc.) that will spark the elimination reflex, (2) occurs almost every waking hour, (3) is not activated for several hours during sleep.
in dogs, precocious neutering can delay or preclude the emergence of wariness towards strangers (brunner, 1968, in fox, 1978), which could possibly confirm the tendency's hormonal cause.
our knowledge is partially extrapolated from ethology studies in birds.
active nerve endings are eliminated all the while the nervous system itself is expanding...
as cyrulnik wrote, "the world of each animal is built around the double constraint of genetics and development".
the wild canines all remained attached to the trainer, at least until they reached maturity, and then became less tolerant to contact with or proximity to the trainer all the while welcoming him with appeasement postures (whereas in the beginning he was welcomed with active postures: jumping, licking, nudging).
when the experimenters mimeplay-fights against these same dogs, they are able to recover a positive dog-dog interaction and complete integration in the same pack within a few days (fuller, 1961 in scott and fuller, 1965).
this attraction subsidesin an almost linear manner after the fifth weekuntil at least 9 weeks.
aggressivity was directed toward males (canines and humans).
from 3 weeks on, the elimination reflex disappears and the puppy tends to leave its bedding to eliminate.
barking is easy to condition.
an adult sheltie (who had lived with a cat and two children) showed sexual attraction for the cat and attacked all dogs (male and female alike); a beagle became "attached" to a vacuum cleaner bag; a basenji (who lived with a female dog) became a delinquent stray who attacked other dogs (scott and fuller, 1965).
in rhesus monkeys, thisdeprivation syndrome leads to high level of blood cortisol.
through species identification a puppy is able to recognize its parents ( filial imprinting), and develop preferential intraspecific social relations (fraternal imprinting) and the relations (sexual imprinting ) which mean the survival of the species (filial and sexual imprinting).
we thus have a phase of facilitated spontaneous learning that begins with a dog's sensorial opening and investigation of stimuli (3 ± ½ weeks) and ends when it develops fear of the unknown (12 ± 2 weeks).
we thus have a phase of facilitated spontaneous learning that begins with a dog's sensorial opening and investigation of stimuli (3 ± ½ weeks) and ends when it develops fear of the unknown (12 ± 2 weeks).
this interaction must last until at least, if not beyond, the 6th week.
it is thus normal to see the appearance of wariness towards strangers (or the unknown) or a loss of certain social experience and sensorial references between 4 months (as in foxes) and 2 years (as in wolves).
according to fox (1975, in fox 1978) this activates the parasympathetic system, facilitating relaxation, digestion and emotionalattachment, and thus socialization as well.
it no longer has the right to greetings, licking and other social attentions given by the other dogs.
the role of the veterinarian is essential because he/she sees the animal from 6 to 16 weeks for its vaccinations.
in fox's experiment (1975) with various wild and domesticated canines, there was a surge in aggressivity in male jackals and wolves at the onset of puberty which increased until it peaked at 2 years.
in a semi-open milieu, the dog tends to flee (and is impossible to catch after the age of 4 months) (scott and fuller, 1965).
the neonatal period we will only say a few words about this period, which arbitrarily ranges from birth to the opening of the eyes at approximately 13 days.
this attitude is extended towards other mother-young conflicts and adopted in the presence of other adults, as shown by the following personal observation.
the fight is rarely traumatic since adult fighting capacities are as yet undeveloped.
there follows avulnerable period of cognitive sensitization at pre-puberty or puberty during which minor trauma can occasionally entrench wariness or fear, (ill­)adaptations, and cognitive and emotional distortions that are undesirable in a dog living among humans in a city environment.
according to fox (1975, in fox 1978) this activates the parasympathetic system, facilitating relaxation, digestion and emotionalattachment, and thus socialization as well.
- failure to control the intensity of biting and risk of serious (wounding) biting in minor confrontations.
in rhesus monkeys, thisdeprivation syndrome leads to high level of blood cortisol.
nothing, however, enables us to affirm or deny that rapid habituation to close stimuli cannot be achieved after 12 weeks.
at pre-puberty, however, dogs emit pheromones that activate demonstrations of authority by the group's dominant dogs.
food hierarchization is average in cockers and beagles with no predominance of either sex.
this phase corresponds to the first surge of social aggressivity identified by pageat.
they learn slowly and forget easily (every trial is like a new experience).
this is because in a group, the dominant members react and put the young dog in its place each time it tries to compete aggressively, barring its access (satellisation) to socially invested areas and sexual partners.
the intensity and frequency of this vocalization normally diminish, to be replaced by intraspecific communication such as postures and rituals.
in clinical practice we have observed cases where phobic behavior (both towards the dog's immediate surroundings and towards humans with which the dog has little contact) and anxiety develop in pre-puberty.
in these cases biting is uncontrolled and the attacked puppy can be wounded (sometimes fatally).
(these young rats are raised by another mother that has not been placed under stress to preclude the possibility of postnatal maternal influence.)
thus before socialization can be acquired, the subjective (cognitive) element of fear must first mature.
the total absence of other dogs (own species) between 3 and 12±5 weeks fosters identification with another species that is closest (in general humans, but occasionally cats, rabbits, etc.) or an appropriate substitute (stuffed animal, vacuum cleaner bag, etc.).
vocalization is used to ward off strangers ('territorial' defense) from the age of 11-15 weeks (see below).
in conclusion, species identification (filial, fraternal and sexual imprinting) is acquired during a sensitive phase of development, and depends on "play-fighting" among puppies (litter-mates).
these experiments enable us to deduce that when a gestating pet is given a friendly and caring human environment (with affectionate physical contact), the domestication and emotional balance of her offspring is facilitated, as compared with an environment where there is no contact and interaction with people.
(these young rats are raised by another mother that has not been placed under stress to preclude the possibility of postnatal maternal influence.)
here we can directly see the overall differences between a city and rural environment of development.
living in a group and adapting to varied environments calls for a certain degree of emotional equilibrium (with minor fluctuations).
the result can be attachment, evenhyper-attachment, later engendering a separation anxiety syndrome.
the relationship risks reverting to one with a demanding-dominant dog and a obedient-submissive owner.
the puppies share and fight over what is left, and gobble it up rapidly, to the complete indifference of the dominant members who return to other activities.
the mother does not compete with her young (7 weeks of age) and allows them full access to the food (even if it is a bone) (scott and fuller, 1965).
the identification phase at birth the puppy has not an innate recognition of members of its species; in a way it does not know it is a dog.
the interactive presence of other animals leads to interspecific socialization and attachment, and it counters predatory behavior.
the main phases in neurological development like humans, dogs belong to a species that matures slowly after birth: the new-born is not completely developed and is incapable of surviving on its own.
to my knowledge, no experiments have been made to determine the duration of the food imprinting phase.
an adult sheltie (who had lived with a cat and two children) showed sexual attraction for the cat and attacked all dogs (male and female alike); a beagle became "attached" to a vacuum cleaner bag; a basenji (who lived with a female dog) became a delinquent stray who attacked other dogs (scott and fuller, 1965).
confinement and hand feeding enable it to accept contact with its laboratory handler(s) but not with strangers, and it still prefers the presence of dogs to that of humans (scott and fuller, 1965).
dogs raised in isolation and placed in contact with others of their species at 16 weeks are attacked and rejected.
among birds, imprinting lasts throughout parental care and this period is shortened when there is a danger of mixing species.
clinical practice shows that when a puppy is acquired at 6 weeks this is already a handicap in developing its adult social and sexual preferences.
the new-born puppy is a completely dependent being, and apparently hardly influenceable psychologically in classical conditioning tests.
a bernese sheep-dog (raised in belgium) developed intermittent anxiety (with pathological anticipations) around the age of 6 months, despite a social and sensorial enrichment between 3 weeks and 4 months.
in another station the mother was taken from the breeding kennel when her puppies were 5 weeks old; these puppies were not submissive to adults when they were first placed with the rest of the group at 12 to 16 weeks.
elimination elimination is a reflex present at birth (it is provoked when the mother licks the puppy's perineum) and becomes spontaneous around2-3 weeks.
without this contact the mother will reject her young in the last two cases (collias, 1956, in scott and fuller, 1965).
likewise for emotional and relational homeostasis we could also envisage the existence of a "sensoriostat ", "thymostat" or "sociostat" respectively measuring a being's sensorial perception, and emotional and social equilibrium.
the rising curve reflects aprogressive attachment to a familiar place (attachment location) while the descending curve after 7-8 weeks is a sign ofemotional maturing (more than habituation) and motivation to explore the unknown.
furthermore the lack of rituals lead to their malfunction, and even changes in their significance: if a dog in a submissive posture is petted (positive reinforcement) it will adopt this posture more often in the search for attention.
if guide dogs for the blind are placed in a foster family at 12 weeks, they generally adapt well, but placement at 14 weeks can prove to hinder performance in later training (scott and fuller, 1965).
it is possible, however, that the future holds surprising discoveries about the epigenetic importance of this neonatal period, especially as concerns the "manipulation" effect on neuro-hormonal development.
it is thus the dog breeder who conditions the location and medium favored for elimination.
this is why this phase is social, spatial and sexual.
they did not use the submissive posture (rolling over); the ritual was not acquired.
this phase corresponds to the first surge of social aggressivity identified by pageat.
the adolescent is pushed from areas occupied by the dominant members (high-placed positions, controlling passages, preferential sleeping areas, etc.).
in a one-on-one or one-on-two fight the bitten puppy is able to turn the tide of the 'battle' and bite its adversary(ies).
in conclusion, species identification (filial, fraternal and sexual imprinting) is acquired during a sensitive phase of development, and depends on "play-fighting" among puppies (litter-mates).
risk factors they are similar to those found among birds.
fear in the presence of a human that handled him decreased from 3 to 5 weeks, was minimal at 5 weeks, then increased again afterwards.
the boldest ones are generally the most dominant; they push back their submissive pack-mates, barring access.
in rodents always, precocious exposition to other species odors eases future interspecific socialization (decrease in aggressions, lowering of corticosteroïds hormones) (caston: 1993).
dogs raised in isolation and placed in contact with others of their species at 16 weeks are attacked and rejected.
from 11 to 15 weeks play-fighting recedes; it becomes less aggressive and more controlled.
the result can be attachment, evenhyper-attachment, later engendering a separation anxiety syndrome.
agonistic co-operation is directed towards outsiders who are investigated and attacked in a manner more "serious" than play-fighting.
in clinical practice we have observed cases where phobic behavior (both towards the dog's immediate surroundings and towards humans with which the dog has little contact) and anxiety develop in pre-puberty.
i was one of the people who helped spread this concept in french-speaking countries (dehasse and de buyser: 1983, 1989, 1991) by emphasizing on several occasions that the sensitive period in the behavioral epigenesis in puppies extended from3 weeks to 3 months of age.
at about 16 weeks the puppies must take their place in line for food, i.e. after the dominant and sub-dominant members, almost last.
fox (1975) experimented with puppies placed in contact with increasingly complex stimuli (enrichment) at 5, 8, 12 and 16 weeks: as they grow the puppies tended to seek out complex environments.
according to fuller (1961), puppies raised in isolation in a laboratory develop adequate socialization to humans if they receive two 20-minute periods of human contact per week.
play-fighting and learning to control biting play-fighting, which begins at 3 weeks, can sometimes be painful when a puppy begins cutting teeth, especially when its ears are bitten.
this effect, called the "gentling", "petting" or "caress" effect, can be prolonged by caresses to the new-born.
the relative absence of other dogs between 3 and 12±5 weeks leads to relative, total or no handicaps depending on circumstances: possible recovery of the dog's species identity at 9 weeks when it plays with other puppies, attachment to the identification species and disinterest or aggression towards canines, despite the (almost) normal capacity to reproduce, the imprinting effects of a mirror placed in the surroundings of a puppy isolated from other puppies have not been studied (to my knowledge).
their activity level is 6 times higher than average dogs raised in normal surroundings ( motor hyperexcitement).
in these cases biting is uncontrolled and the attacked puppy can be wounded (sometimes fatally).
this is probably linked to the social species' innate need for contact.
the human desire to give and receive attention is opposed to the normal (agonistic) parental behavior to wean the puppy, detach oneself and encourage autonomy.
in females, progesterone favors territorial defense behavior, just as it favors whelping and pseudocyesis.
if the dominant members fail to react, aggressivity is reinforced and the young dog rises in hierarchy.
advantages a puppy's malleability enables it to rapidly adapt to almost all human environments without undo stress.
let's look at a few experimental cases: puppies raised in a semi-open environment in (nearly) complete isolation from humans reacted differently towards an active unfamiliar observer depending on their age.
when the experimenters mimeplay-fights against these same dogs, they are able to recover a positive dog-dog interaction and complete integration in the same pack within a few days (fuller, 1961 in scott and fuller, 1965).
her sister acquired the same tendency in a completely different environment (netherlands), as did her brother (in switzerland).
superficial, limited observation of the new-born puppy could lead one to believe it did not even belong to the canine species: awkward, dragging itself around, oriented to contact, the mother's teats and the smell of milk, yapping in distress when isolated, cold, hungry or in pain, and having only a limited capacity to keep itself warm and to learn.
discussion and conclusions no quantitative studies have been made on intra-breed variability, and inter-breed studies have only concerned a few family lines in selected breeds.
enriched puppies are systematically dominant in the presence of stimulus-poor dogs.
various measurements (volume, weight, percentage of dry matter, oxygen consumption) of the brain show that growth is rapid until the 6-7th week when development suddenly slackens considerably.
this short contact, however, is not enough for basenji puppies; this variability is thus truly linked to breed (genetics) (scott and fuller, 1965).
barking from distress when left alone in an unknown place increases from 3 to6-8 weeks (maximum) then decreases until 12 weeks.
it is thus infra-species: it is a "type" socialization (human: man, woman, adolescent, child, baby, black, white, with/without beard, hat, white apron, etc.).
the emotional self-regulation (homeostasis) phase homeostasis is the ability of an organism to maintain an equilibrium in a variable environment.
to my knowledge, no experiments have been made to determine the duration of the food imprinting phase.
it is thus infra-species: it is a "type" socialization (human: man, woman, adolescent, child, baby, black, white, with/without beard, hat, white apron, etc.).
advantages this ease of conditioning can be put to an advantage in teaching dogs to eliminate in gutters and other sewer outlets.
this free access ends as the puppy becomes autonomous and takes its place in the adult hierarchy (pageat).
in rats, once again, manipulation (contact, exposure to cold, etc.) at a young age or before birth (manipulation of the pregnant mother) gives greater resistance to stress (cold, hunger) and disease (implanted tumors).
when a puppy is acquired at 7 weeks and left alone at night it will bark in distress.
risk factors interspecific communication with humans, also a vocal and verbal animal, reinforces the vocal element (learning by imitation), which then becomes preponderant, even disruptive.
- the threshold of socialization (number of interactions) is variable and depends on factors that are internal (breed, individual) or external (mother's fearful behavior, quality of the surroundings, etc.).
a bernese sheep-dog (raised in belgium) developed intermittent anxiety (with pathological anticipations) around the age of 6 months, despite a social and sensorial enrichment between 3 weeks and 4 months.
just as we have thermo-regulation (thermal homeostasis), we can also speak of emotional and relational homeostasis (vincent, 1986).
among birds, imprinting lasts throughout parental care and this period is shortened when there is a danger of mixing species.
the beagles were chosen for their anxious-inhibited (depressive) behavior.
the characteristics of this learning phase are the same as those of interspecific socialization (facilitated but requiring reinforcement, low level of generalization, etc.).the characteristics of this learning phase are the same as those of interspecific socialization (facilitated but requiring reinforcement, low level of generalization, etc.).
isolation leads to a diminution of the dendritic network in the monkey frontal cortex; it also induces a reversible diminution of the activity of the mesocorticofrontal dopaminergic pathways (with hyperreactivity to stress), associated with a slight increase of the activity of the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways (verdoux and bourgeois: 1991).
depending on the information presented (learning), he/she either continues (motivation) or stops (habituation, impregnation, or self-limitation) looking out the open window.
it is possible that this phase is similar to the self-regulation phase, both in its duration and characteristics, since it engenders a food or feeding preference that is persistent but changeable over time.
we should also mention that the first signs of humping (pre-imitation of future sexual behavior) appear as early as 3 to 4 weeks (scott and fuller, 1965).
this adaptation is possible only through habituation (disappearance of reactions) to certain stimuli.
puppies raised in surroundings poor in stimuli ("stimulus-poor puppies") and placed for the first time in a highly stimulating environment at 12 or 16 weeks are inhibited (fear) and search less complex environments.
fox (1978) studied primary and secondary socialization in wild dogs and other canines that were raised in identical environments and had daily contact with the trainer and intermittent contact with unfamiliar humans.
this referential determines the stimulation level at which the individual must begin to adjust by activating the appropriate emotion (fear, wariness, etc.) and adopting the most appropriate adaptive behavior (investigation, avoidance, flight, aggression, inhibition, etc.).
in a husky breeding station the presence of the mother beyond the 5th week led to her puppies' spontaneous submission to the adults of the pack.
in conclusion: "industrial" kennel conditions suffice to cause anxiety and inhibition (undoubtedly favored in this case by the breed and enclosure in a 9m² cage).
this barking disappears spontaneously after a few days as it becomes familiar with its new home (with reassuring significance), unless its behavior receives positive reinforcement from its new masters (who come to pet, calm or scold the distressed puppy, or take it into their room, all signs of attention - thus positive reinforcement).
a puppy raised in a deprived environment may be tempted to compensate for this lack of sensorial stimulation byself-stimulation: this is how certain stereotyped behavior develops, as well as self-centered behavior (fox, 1975), such as self-induced dermatoses.
note that, unlike goats and sheep, adult dogs show no parental rejection of their young!
the presence of the mother is thus favorable, even necessary, for the development of appeasement-submission rituals and for the puppy's hierarchization in the adult pack.
an overall inhibition index was established (4 tests each rated from 1 to 6, for a total ranging from 4 to 24 points, with 24 being the value for a normal dog).
- at the start of the experiment, all the dogs tested between 4 to 10 points.
at the mother's arrival the puppies assemble in the attempt to nurse and wait for their mother to regurgitate pre-digested food: they wag their tails, lick and bite at the mother's chops and try to take regurgitated food directly from her mouth.
nevertheless a mere daily contact, and handling every other week were enough to lower the level of inhibition and anxiety in this group of young adult dogs significantly.
here are a few examples: christy, a female puppy, was raised in complete isolation from other dogs by the "colony" of students at the jackson laboratory.
i also participated in a study on the effects of a serotoninergic psychotropic drug on the behavior of beagles raised in a kennel.
biting in minor confrontations.
he was placed with other dogs also raised in isolation; the dogs lived alongside each other, without aggression but also without interaction (fisher, 1955 in scott and fuller, 1965).
weaning-detachment and (food) hierarchization a mother's care and attachment towards her puppies are strongest during the first 3 weeks of life, and after that progressively recede.
this occasionally leads to an anxiety syndrome which i call "anticipated defense behavior" (dehasse, 1990a).
fox also pointed out that competitive aggressivity may not appear in wolves (males as well as females) until 4-5 years of age (maturity).
the fights become ritualized, a sign that stable hierarchical relations are being established.
these play-fights also lead to a certain hierarchization of relations (less than 25% among litter-mates at 5 weeks of age)
there follows avulnerable period of cognitive sensitization at pre-puberty or puberty during which minor trauma can occasionally entrench wariness or fear, (ill)adaptations, and cognitive and emotional distortions that are undesirable in a dog living among humans in a city environment.
risk factors differences in the quality and amount of stimuli a puppy receives in its environment of development as compared to its adult surroundings determine the degree ofrisk it may not be able to adapt its sensorial referential (thymostat) and thus achieve emotional homeostasis (this includes development of phobias and anxieties).
advantages the interactive presence of different types of humans between 3 and 12 ± 2 weeks facilitates a puppy's generalized socialization to humans.
risk factors if adolescent dogs do not undergo hierarchization-satellisation, they gain hierarchy - access to the privileges of the dominant member.
at 9 weeks she was introduced to other dogs: the adults growled at her but showed no further signs of aggression and the puppies (litter-mates) began to play-fight and she responded.
since no interaction is possible with a mirror image, this seems to be a poor substitute for suitable "imprinting".
risk factors if the puppy's owners fail to reproduce play-fighting postures and allow it to bite their hands, arms and legs, this can lead to: - the puppy's hierarchical dominance that can induce relational problems later on (competitive aggressivity, sociopathy).
indeed, the process of organizing stimuli from the outside world, classifying them as known or unknown, agreeable, disagreeable or indifferent (their "significance", meaning, socialization) is similar to the process ofinterspecific socialization.
the adolescent is pushed from areas occupied by the dominant members (high-placed positions, controlling passages, preferential sleeping areas, etc.).
advantages the interactive presence of different types of humans between 3 and 12 ± 2 weeks facilitates a puppy's generalized socialization to humans.
agonistic co-operation is directed towards outsiders who are investigated and attacked in a manner more "serious" than play-fighting.
to my knowledge, no statistical studies have been made on dogs raised in isolation, covering a broad range of breeds (for ethical reasons?), which means that crucial experimental data are lacking.
fear in the presence of a human that handled him decreased from 3 to 5 weeks, was minimal at 5 weeks, then increased again afterwards.
thecapacity to generalize varies from one species to another (dog and wolf, more than coyotes), breed (watchdogs less than other dogs, according to fox, 1978), the family line and individual (no statistical studies available).
puppies attempting to snitch food while the dominant members are eating are snapped at, growled at and threatened with being bitten.
play-fighting and learning to control biting play-fighting, which begins at 3 weeks, can sometimes be painful when a puppy begins cutting teeth, especially when its ears are bitten.
eventually, this is merely one element in the acquisition of self-regulation as regards particular stimuli because they areinteractive.
they did not use the submissive posture (rolling over); the ritual was not acquired.
this attitude is extended towards other mother-young conflicts and adopted in the presence of other adults, as shown by the following personal observation.
at pre-puberty, however, dogs emit pheromones that activate demonstrations of authority by the group's dominant dogs.
the intensity and frequency of this vocalization normally diminish, to be replaced by intraspecific communication such as postures and rituals.
advantages a puppy's malleability enables it to rapidly adapt to almost all human environments without undo stress.
this has been demonstrated in rodents: certain strains of mice (dbj/2j) have shown an innate hypersensitivity to certain sound frequencies which give them convulsions (dantzer, 1988).
it is possible that this phase is similar to the self-regulation phase, both in its duration and characteristics, since it engenders a food or feeding preference that is persistent but changeable over time.
this barking disappears spontaneously after a few days as it becomes familiar with its new home (with reassuring significance), unless its behavior receives positive reinforcement from its new masters (who come to pet, calm or scold the distressed puppy, or take it into their room, all signs of attention - thus positive reinforcement).
this occasionally leads to an anxiety syndrome which i call "anticipated defense behavior" (dehasse, 1990a).
the puppy learns to make an empathetic link between the opponent's squeal and the pain invoked.
this reflects cyrulnik's (1991) remarks that the brain becomes atrophied when [an animal] is raised in sensorial isolation, and it develops more than average in an environment of hyperstimulation in noise, affectivity, odors, tastes, sight, etc.... - neurobiological studies have showed that prolonged precocious isolation was responsible for long-lasting structural or functional cerebral modifications .
we should also mention that the first signs of humping (pre-imitation of future sexual behavior) appear as early as 3 to 4 weeks (scott and fuller, 1965).
and lastly, failure to develop a dog's general motor control encourages hyperkinetic forms of behavior.
for caston, sensorial and social deprivation has impeached the maturation of the brain: it can not exert an inhibitory influence on the mesencephalic reticular formation (mrf) anymore; mrf is becoming hyperactive, and produces unfocalised and unadaptative behaviors.
risk factors if the puppy's owners fail to reproduce play-fighting postures and allow it to bite their hands, arms and legs, this can lead to: the puppy's hierarchical dominance that can induce relational problems later on (competitive aggressivity, sociopathy).
he also accustomed wolf cubs to humans, then isolated them: in this case there wasde-socialization (instability of precocious socialization).young animals need continuous reinforcement.
it is thus normal to see the appearance of wariness towards strangers (or the unknown) or a loss of certain social experience and sensorial references between 4 months (as in foxes) and 2 years (as in wolves).
we shall also point out the risk factors that can undermine the harmonious interaction between humans and their dogs.
it is worth mentioning that the brain is totally unmyelinated at birth, except for the trigeminal nerve and the non-acoustic part of the auditory nerve which correspond to the new-born's orientation reflexes (herman 1958, in scott & fuller 1965).
the threshold of socialization (number of interactions) is variable and depends on factors that are internal (breed, individual) or external (mother's fearful behavior, quality of the surroundings, etc.).
it is my hypothesis that an optimal period of attraction-habituation (acquiring sensorial and emotion homeostasic referentials) closes with an emotional and behavioral phase of aversion-fear of the unknown (5-14 weeks).
a puppy raised in a deprived environment may be tempted to compensate for this lack of sensorial stimulation byself-stimulation: this is how certain stereotyped behavior develops, as well as self-centered behavior (fox, 1975), such as self-induced dermatoses.
although the behavioral signs are precocious, thesubjective element evolves gradually over a year (at least).
the redundancy is temporary.
it is worth mentioning that the brain is totally unmyelinated at birth, except for the trigeminal nerve and the non-acoustic part of the auditory nerve which correspond to the new-born's orientation reflexes (herman 1958, in scott & fuller 1965).
the new-born puppy is a completely dependent being, and apparently hardly influenceable psychologically in classical conditioning tests.
we can postulate an intra-uterine and post-natal food acculturation.
this attraction subsidesin an almost linear manner after the fifth weekuntil at least 9 weeks.
thisdelay can foster sociopathy and certainly does not facilitate obedience.
a dog's epigenesis engenders multiple temperaments that can be partially foreseen by controlling its environmental stimuli.
pageat (1984) demonstrated the existence of a triple surge of social aggressivity in dogs (male spaniels): - the first peaks around 4-5 months with the dog returning to normal around 6-6½ months, when it begins obedience lessons (the owners assert their dominance); - the second surge coincides with the production of sexual steroids (±5 months); - the third corresponds to a "second attempt to obtain reproduction rights" and only occurs in dogs who are allowed to live in the house.
one factor favorable to emotional and relational well-balance of a dog that must live with humans in a city context is enrichment in the breeding environment.
the attraction recedes under the influence offear of the unknown behavior which grows after 5 weeks; the puppy "recovers" from its initial fearful reaction instantaneously from 3 to 5 weeks (investigation behavior effect), and then it remains wary for longer periods as it grows older.
interspecies socialization (attachment) does not have the same characteristics as species identification: - it is easily acquired but requires permanent reinforcement to avoid de-socialization; - it is not generalized (generalisable) to all individuals of the species concerned, but remains relatively limited to the individual's characteristics.
the mother does not compete with her young (7 weeks of age) and allows them full access to the food (even if it is a bone) (scott and fuller, 1965).
this referential determines the stimulation level at which the individual must begin to adjust by activating the appropriate emotion (fear, wariness, etc.) and adopting the most appropriate adaptive behavior (investigation, avoidance, flight, aggression, inhibition, etc.).
the cognitive process it entails leads to a dog'santicipating harmful situations that exist only in its mind (in a way, fear of being attacked) and thus behavioral strategies (defense mechanisms: flight, aggression, inhibition).
put in the presence of a bitch in oestrus, they show a state of increased excitement but they direct it towards stereotyped habitual behaviors and not towards the stimuli coming from the bitch.
the motor cortex is the more developed at birth.
when put on the defensive a cocker's bite is "softer" than that of other breeds tested (basenji, terrier, beagle, sheltie).
the emotional self-regulation (homeostasis) phase homeostasis is the ability of an organism to maintain an equilibrium in a variable environment.
the prenatal period pregnant rats that have been placed under stress or injected with acth or adrenaline give birth to young rats that are emotive and perform less well than a control group.
they are tested at 10 months old.
risk factors interspecific communication with humans, also a vocal and verbal animal, reinforces the vocal element (learning by imitation), which then becomes preponderant, even disruptive.
her sister acquired the same tendency in a completely different environment (netherlands), as did her brother (in switzerland).
it is best to begin group courses around 3 months of age, so that the dogs can become familiar with each other and hierarchies before puberty.
the more "aggressive" the litter (line, breed), the greater the tendency for linear hierarchization.
the beagles were chosen for their anxious-inhibited (depressive) behavior.
this implies a structured and caring parental environment (caring for the young), reflexes that orient the young puppy to its parents, and the existence of optimal, even crucial, periods in the development of the animal's nervous system.
the characteristics of this learning phase are the same as those of interspecific socialization (facilitated but requiring reinforcement, low level of generalization, etc.).
hierarchization for food privileges thus occurs around 16 weeks.
when a pair of puppies not competing for maternal attention are given a bone there is aggressive competition ending with a winner and a looser.
the young dog develops an interest for the opposite sex and for areas occupied by the dominant members, who react by pushing the adolescent to the fringe of the group.
it reproduces the same characteristics as the second phase, only this time with all the weapons, strength and passions of a mature adult.
the wild canines all remained attached to the trainer, at least until they reached maturity, and then became less tolerant to contact with or proximity to the trainer all the while welcoming him with appeasement postures (whereas in the beginning he was welcomed with active postures: jumping, licking, nudging).
an overall inhibition index was established (4 tests each rated from 1 to 6, for a total ranging from 4 to 24 points, with 24 being the value for a normal dog).
the socialization-domestication phase a puppy is not programmed to interact socially with another species.
in a now classic experiment (by weisel and hubel from 1963, in changeux 1983) with monkeys, noticeable visual defects were caused when one eye was sewn shut during the first six weeks of life; the problems were reversible if the eye was re-opened after three weeks' time.
puppies manipulated this way show a greater tolerance to touching than dogs born of a mother who was not petted.
the second phase of hierarchization, puberty, is sexual, social and zonal-spatial.
an aggression-inhibition relationship - a dominant-submissive hierarchization - is then established between the mother and puppy for access to the mother's teats.
he/she thus theoretically has several occasions to assess the puppies' early emotional and behavioral development and can recommend preventive measures and training techniques.
the results mentioned are thus qualitative and speculative, as are the dates and periods.
the process is complex: sexual pheromones are awakened at puberty, activating "desire" (vincent, 1986), the dog exhibits courting behavior and is rejected outright by the dominant member of the same sex, the only one of the group with the right to exhibit his/her sexuality openly.
dogs have a cynomorphic approach to the human-dog relationship, seeing it first as one between puppy-adult dog, then as an interaction between pack-mates (pre-adult-adult).
the trainer must not only inculcate the bases for instrumental learning, he/she must also take advantage of having a group of dogs to continue their socialization and avoid de-socialization, both towards other dogs and towards humans.
i was one of the people who helped spread this concept in french-speaking countries (dehasse and de buyser: 1983, 1989, 1991) by emphasizing on several occasions that the sensitive period in the behavioral epigenesis in puppies extended from3 weeks to 3 months of age.
in other words, fear of the unknown has both an emotional and behavioral phase (starting around 5 weeks) and acognitive phase (near puberty).
thecapacity to generalize varies from one species to another (dog and wolf, more than coyotes), breed (watchdogs less than other dogs, according to fox, 1978), the family line and individual (no statistical studies available).
in a husky breeding station the presence of the mother beyond the 5th week led to her puppies' spontaneous submission to the adults of the pack.
fox also pointed out that competitive aggressivity may not appear in wolves (males as well as females) until 4-5 years of age (maturity).
the occipital cortex, however, then grows more rapidly than the motor and frontal lobes; it also contains several immature neuroblasts that reach full development only around 3 weeks of age (fox, 1965).
risk factors feeding a puppy solely on standardized food, invariable in taste and appearance (dry or moist) can lead to long-term preferences and rejection of other types of food (this has been clinically proven in cats).
according to charles and fuller (1956) (in scott and fuller: 1965) the alpha rhythm that appears at 21 days signals an activation of the sense of sight.
the total absence of other dogs (own species) between 3 and 12±5 weeks fosters identification with another species that is closest (in general humans, but occasionally cats, rabbits, etc.) or an appropriate substitute (stuffed animal, vacuum cleaner bag, etc.).
similar experiments on cats show there is a sensitive period for visual development between 3 and 7 weeks of age, and incapacity to recover vision after three months (weisel and hubel, in vastrade, 1987).
puppies attempting to snitch food while the dominant members are eating are snapped at, growled at and threatened with being bitten.
in adults this leads to: - courting behavior and attempts to copulate with the identification species (despite activation by pheromones of one's own species), no behavior of this type or else awkward attempts with a sexual partner of the same species, - social preference for the identification species, - rejection (flight or fight) of one's own species (including mirror images).
if the dominant members fail to react, aggressivity is reinforced and the young dog rises in hierarchy.
it is possible, however, that the future holds surprising discoveries about the epigenetic importance of this neonatal period, especially as concerns the "manipulation" effect on neuro-hormonal development.
on the other hand, puppies raised in a family from 4 weeks of age (becoming used to dogs, cats and/or children), without renewed contact with the laboratory dogs, show greater familiarity with people than with dogs.
in adults this leads to: courting behavior and attempts to copulate with the identification species (despite activation by pheromones of one's own species), no behavior of this type or else awkward attempts with a sexual partner of the same species, social preference for the identification species, rejection (flight or fight) of one's own species (including mirror images).
behavioural epigenesis is influenced by environmental factors, by the surroundings.
indeed, the process of organizing stimuli from the outside world, classifying them as known or unknown, agreeable, disagreeable or indifferent (their "significance", meaning, socialization) is similar to the process ofinterspecific socialization.
a dog's tactile capacities develop before birth, and it is possible that it already becomes used to contact in the uterus, when the mother is petted.
in conclusion: behavioral patterns develop over successive phases, according to internal and external factors that interact in a complex and continuous manner.
it is best to begin group courses around 3 months of age, so that the dogs can become familiar with each other and hierarchies before puberty.
the relative absence of other dogs between 3 and 12±5 weeks leads to relative, total or no handicaps depending on circumstances: - possible recovery of the dog's species identity at 9 weeks when it plays with other puppies, - attachment to the identification species and disinterest or aggression towards canines, despite the (almost) normal capacity to reproduce, the imprinting effects of a mirror placed in the surroundings of a puppy isolated from other puppies have not been studied (to my knowledge).
w biting is thus stopped, inhibited and controlled.
- dogs have a cynomorphic approach to the human-dog relationship, seeing it first as one between puppy-adult dog, then as an interaction between pack-mates (pre-adult-adult).
the immaturity of the nervous system at birth is obvious: cragg (1975) calculated that in cats the number of synapses per cortical neuron grows from a few hundred to nearly 12,000 in the 10th to 35th day after birth (in changeux, 1983).
in conclusion: behavioral patterns develop over successive phases, according to internal and external factors that interact in a complex and continuous manner.
similar experiments on cats show there is a sensitive period for visual development between 3 and 7 weeks of age, and incapacity to recover vision after three months (weisel and hubel, in vastrade, 1987).
the precocious learning-conditioning phase this is another variant of the phase sensitive to emotional development that occurs between 3 ± ½ and 12 ± 2 weeks.
this phase is generally accompanied by territorial defense behavior.
the dog's particular nature - a puppy has to learn to identify its own species - can serve to foster socialization with other species (called domestication when it involves interaction with humans).
this ability is an opportunity, but also a cause for risk.
the sheltie, on the other hand, develops a strong hierarchy in defending the nest (spatial-territorial) and submissive members (females) are pushed inside the nest.
this interaction must last until at least, if not beyond, the 6th week.
as the effects of the psychotropic drug were not significantly demonstrated compared to that of a placebo, the evolution towards 'normal' behavior could be imputed to the effects of the experiment itself, since the dogs were tested every other week (5 minutes maximum per dog) and given medicine twice a day.
a stressful environment (feral dog) will close this phase ahead of time (probably around 7 to 9 weeks).
experiments by cyrulnik with cats have shown that attachment depends on the cholinergic system; anti-cholinergics block the attachment process.
these risks are avoided when dog owners behave in a way that can be assimilated to the parent-dog relationship.
all puppies that are correctly socialized will "leap" towards humans who enter their area (bed, cage,...).
* stimulus-poor primates show a greater degree of attachment to their mother (pathological hyper-attachment), which led bobbitt (1968, in fox 1975) to propose thatdetachment from the mother is a continual process linked to a young being's attachment to the environment.
for caston, sensorial and social deprivation has impeached the maturation of the brain: it can not exert an inhibitory influence on the mesencephalic reticular formation (mrf) anymore; mrf is becoming hyperactive, and produces unfocalised and unadaptative behaviors.
the number of brain cells and their myelination reaches full adult maturity at 4 weeks.
"recovery" (improvement or disappearance of fear) after a week of interaction-socialization was more efficient at 3 weeks; it was roughly the same at 5, 7 and 9 weeks (freedman, king, elliott, 1961, in scott and fuller, 1965).
the referentials that come into play are level of noise, visual agitation, intensity of olfactory stimulation, number of vibrations, occupation of three-dimensional space, flexibility or rigidity of movements, etc.
risk factors differences in the quality and amount of stimuli a puppy receives in its environment of development as compared to its adult surroundings determine the degree ofrisk it may not be able to adapt its sensorial referential (thymostat) and thus achieve emotional homeostasis (this includes development of phobias and anxieties).
in rats, once again, manipulation (contact, exposure to cold, etc.) at a young age or before birth (manipulation of the pregnant mother) gives greater resistance to stress (cold, hunger) and disease (implanted tumors).
puppies manipulated this way show a greater tolerance to touching than dogs born of a mother who was not petted.
this has been demonstrated in rodents: certain strains of mice (dbj/2j) have shown an innate hypersensitivity to certain sound frequencies which give them convulsions (dantzer, 1988).
eventually, this is merely one element in the acquisition of self-regulation as regards particular stimuli because they areinteractive.
the same holds for dogs: when a normally socialized puppy is isolated from humans and placed in a kennel from 3-4 months of age to 6-8 months he becomes fearful in the presence of humans, even the trainer.
although the behavioral signs are precocious, thesubjective element evolves gradually over a year (at least).
all puppies that are correctly socialized will "leap" towards humans who enter their area (bed, cage,...).
the dog's relation with its master thus becomes ambivalent, withconflicting messages: demands (dominance) - tolerance (submission).
according to fuller (1961), puppies raised in isolation in a laboratory develop adequate socialization to humans if they receive two 20-minute periods of human contact per week.
a puppy - raised in the same type of surroundings - was placed 10 minutes a day with a passive observer, calmly sitting in the room and paying no attention to the dog (scott and fuller, 1965): - at 3 to 5 weeks, the puppy investigated the observer openly; - at 7 weeks, it took 2 days before it investigated (2 10-minute sessions) - at 9 weeks, 3 days; - at 14 weeks it no longer investigated the observer.
the same experiment on adult monkeys showed no effect on vision.
the human tends to fear for the puppy's health and thus pays particular attention to its appetite, watching it while it eats, indulging it when it begs, worrying about finicky appetites or loss of appetite, varying food, and hand-feeding, which become invested with the social symbol of dominance.
ducklings become attached to their mother between the 13th and 16th hour of life (hess 1959, in cyrulnik 1989), it takes 5 minutes of contact during the first hour after birth for a she-goat to become attached to the odor of her kid (bateson, 1981), and a ewe needs contact within 4 hours after the birth of her lamb.
the young dog develops an interest for the opposite sex and for areas occupied by the dominant members, who react by pushing the adolescent to the fringe of the group.
- human skin is more fragile than a dogs.
just as we have thermo-regulation (thermal homeostasis), we can also speak of emotional and relational homeostasis (vincent, 1986).
isolation leads to a diminution of the dendritic network in the monkey frontal cortex; it also induces a reversible diminution of the activity of the mesocorticofrontal dopaminergic pathways (with hyperreactivity to stress), associated with a slight increase of the activity of the mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathways (verdoux and bourgeois: 1991).
the lack of comprehensible appeasement rituals favors attitudes of competitive aggression (sociopathy) or substituting behavior (sometimes self-directed).
the media can also play a role in educating potential dog owners to adapt their relational needs to the dog's ecological and social reality, rather than their own personal wishes.
this effect, called the "gentling", "petting" or "caress" effect, can be prolonged by caresses to the new-born.
learning to control the intensity of its bite is actually part of a puppy's growing generalcontrol of its movements, enabling it to adopt postures and facial mimics which become the prevalent form of communication in animals having highly developed brains.
this is why this phase is social, spatial and sexual.
hierarchization for food privileges thus occurs around 16 weeks.
put in the presence of a bitch in oestrus, they show a state of increased excitement but they direct it towards stereotyped habitual behaviors and not towards the stimuli coming from the bitch.
superficial, limited observation of the new-born puppy could lead one to believe it did not even belong to the canine species: awkward, dragging itself around, oriented to contact, the mother's teats and the smell of milk, yapping in distress when isolated, cold, hungry or in pain, and having only a limited capacity to keep itself warm and to learn.
to my knowledge, no statistical studies have been made on dogs raised in isolation, covering a broad range of breeds (for ethical reasons?), which means that crucial experimental data are lacking.
thisdelay can foster sociopathy and certainly does not facilitate obedience.
feeding food conditioning studies have been conducted on cats that became vegetarian or imitated their mother who ate bananas.
advantages this ease of conditioning can be put to an advantage in teaching dogs to eliminate in gutters and other sewer outlets.
this adaptation is possible only through habituation (disappearance of reactions) to certain stimuli.
risk factors clinical observation shows that when some puppies are limited to one spot and medium until the age of 15 weeks (puppies kept in the house and elimination on newspapers, for example) it becomes almost impossible for them to learn to use other media and locations (conditioning) and they retain themselves for hours when walking outside until they can eliminate on their preferred medium and spot.
behavioural epigenesis (ethogenesis) is linked to the way neuronal connections areorganised (theory of selective stabilization ).
the precocious learning-conditioning phase this is another variant of the phase sensitive to emotional development that occurs between 3 ± ½ and 12 ± 2 weeks.
the master then obeys by petting it.
clinical observation has also confirmed that it is easier to transfer from an environment with a high level of stimulation (city) to an environment with a low level (rural) than the contrary.
according to klosovskii (1963), puppies and kittens that undergo periods of forced rotation for several days have vestibular neurons that are larger than those of animals that have not received this stimulus (in fox: 1965).
interspecies socialization (attachment) does not have the same characteristics as species identification: it is easily acquired but requires permanent reinforcement to avoid de-socialization; it is not generalized (generalisable) to all individuals of the species concerned, but remains relatively limited to the individual's characteristics.
in a semi-open milieu, the dog tends to flee (and is impossible to catch after the age of 4 months) (scott and fuller, 1965).
woolpy (1968, in fox, 1975) accustomed adult wild wolves to contact with humans in 6 months' time; he then isolated them somewhat from humans: in this case they retained their socialization experience.
note that canines are perfectly capable of distinguishing the sex of humans, even when they are dressed alike; this is probably through their sense of smell.
in a one-on-one or one-on-two fight the bitten puppy is able to turn the tide of the 'battle' and bite its adversary(ies).
the results mentioned are thus qualitative and speculative, as are the dates and periods.
the presence of other species during this period does not hamper identification with one's own species.
it is my hypothesis that an optimal period of attraction-habituation (acquiring sensorial and emotion homeostasic referentials) closes with an emotional and behavioral phase of aversion-fear of the unknown (5-14 weeks).
pageat (1984) demonstrated the existence of a triple surge of social aggressivity in dogs (male spaniels): the first peaks around 4-5 months with the dog returning to normal around 6-6½ months, when it begins obedience lessons (the owners assert their dominance); the second surge coincides with the production of sexual steroids (±5 months); the third corresponds to a "second attempt to obtain reproduction rights" and only occurs in dogs who are allowed to live in the house.
male dogs are raised in normally lightened cages for the 10 first months of their life, but without any contact with the outside world (restricted sensorial situation).
the intensity of the bite is (congenitally) variable depending on the individual, line and breed, and can be modified considerably by training.
puberty and hierarchization dogs are social animals that need company, living in a hierarchical pack (or family-pack).
in conclusion, puppies demonstrate an investigation-attraction behavior towards the unfamiliar as soon as they are able to express this attraction (almost adult motor capacity), in other words at3±½ weeks.
vocalization is used to ward off strangers ('territorial' defense) from the age of 11-15 weeks (see below).
the relative absence of human contact leads to relative handicaps, such as fear/wariness/phobia towards a type of human (children, men,...).
this implies a structured and caring parental environment (caring for the young), reflexes that orient the young puppy to its parents, and the existence of optimal, even crucial, periods in the development of the animal's nervous system.
at 9 weeks she was introduced to other dogs: the adults growled at her but showed no further signs of aggression and the puppies (litter-mates) began to play-fight and she responded.
from 3 weeks on, the elimination reflex disappears and the puppy tends to leave its bedding to eliminate.
"recovery" (improvement or disappearance of fear) after a week of interaction-socialization was more efficient at 3 weeks; it was roughly the same at 5, 7 and 9 weeks (freedman, king, elliott, 1961, in scott and fuller, 1965).
barking from distress when left alone in an unknown place increases from 3 to6-8 weeks (maximum) then decreases until 12 weeks.
without this contact the mother will reject her young in the last two cases (collias, 1956, in scott and fuller, 1965).
the intensity of the bite is (congenitally) variable depending on the individual, line and breed, and can be modified considerably by training.
this free access ends as the puppy becomes autonomous and takes its place in the adult hierarchy (pageat).
the attraction recedes under the influence offear of the unknown behavior which grows after 5 weeks; the puppy "recovers" from its initial fearful reaction instantaneously from 3 to 5 weeks (investigation behavior effect), and then it remains wary for longer periods as it grows older.
at the mother's arrival the puppies assemble in the attempt to nurse and wait for their mother to regurgitate pre-digested food: they wag their tails, lick and bite at the mother's chops and try to take regurgitated food directly from her mouth.
the boldest ones are generally the most dominant; they push back their submissive pack-mates, barring access.
in conclusion, puppies demonstrate an investigation-attraction behavior towards the unfamiliar as soon as they are able to express this attraction (almost adult motor capacity), in other words at3±½ weeks.
when a puppy is acquired at 7 weeks and left alone at night it will bark in distress.
this problem can be avoided by giving the puppy a variety of food.
he was placed with other dogs also raised in isolation; the dogs lived alongside each other, without aggression but also without interaction (fisher, 1955 in scott and fuller, 1965).
it is the breeder's role is to ensure temperamental selection and to enrich the development environment (under veterinary guidance).
the interactive presence of other animals leads to interspecific socialization and attachment, and it counters predatory behavior.
interspecific socialization counters predatory behavior towards the type of attachment individual.
w reciprocal biting negatively reinforces its intensity.
since puppies do not have such short periods of facilitated learning, we will use the term sensitive period.
we shall also point out the risk factors that can undermine the harmonious interaction between humans and their dogs.
in 4 days time her behavior was indistinguishable from that of the other puppies (scott and fuller, 1965).
our knowledge is partially extrapolated from ethology studies in birds.
each puppy was taken from the surrounding in which it was raised, placed in contact with humans for one week, and again tested.
* stimulus-poor primates show a greater degree of attachment to their mother (pathological hyper-attachment), which led bobbitt (1968, in fox 1975) to propose thatdetachment from the mother is a continual process linked to a young being's attachment to the environment.
depending on the information presented (learning), he/she either continues (motivation) or stops (habituation, impregnation, or self-limitation) looking out the open window.
lastly, stimulus-poor puppies run the risk of developing hyper-attachments to their biological or adoptive parents (transposition of hyper-attachment to its new human masters), which is a source of intolerance to isolation, attention-seeking behavior, reutilization of behavior acquired during illnesses, etc.
the concept of sensitive period the prenatal period the neonatal period the identification phase the socialization-domestication phase the emotional self-regulation (homeostasis) phase the precocious learning-conditioning phase weaning-detachment and hierarchization the cognitive sensitization-rationalization in pre-puberty puberty and hierarchization discussion and conclusions bibliography introduction in our western culture, the relation between humans and dogs is played out in a historical and socio-economic context that fosters the emergence of behavioral dysfunctions in animals (the discrepancy between the imagined dog and reality).many behavioral problems in dogs arise from a failure to recognize social and environmental constraints during their growth.
the media can also play a role in educating potential dog owners to adapt their relational needs to the dog's ecological and social reality, rather than their own personal wishes.
male dogs are raised in normally lightened cages for the 10 first months of their life, but without any contact with the outside world (restricted sensorial situation).
this type of learning presents several characteristics: it is stable, rigid and persistent (sometimes for life); it is easily acquired; sexual imprinting occurs on supra-individual and supra-breed characteristics, which permits species generalization; filial imprinting (attachment) seems to be more discriminating and is limited to parents; fraternal imprinting is the basis of sociability; attachment is an interactive process.
this breed has been shown to "respect" (accept) the female's priority to food.
furthermore the lack of rituals lead to their malfunction, and even changes in their significance: if a dog in a submissive posture is petted (positive reinforcement) it will adopt this posture more often in the search for attention.
a puppy - raised in the same type of surroundings - was placed 10 minutes a day with a passive observer, calmly sitting in the room and paying no attention to the dog (scott and fuller, 1965): at 3 to 5 weeks, the puppy investigated the observer openly; at 7 weeks, it took 2 days before it investigated (2 10-minute sessions)
the process is complex: sexual pheromones are awakened at puberty, activating "desire" (vincent, 1986), the dog exhibits courting behavior and is rejected outright by the dominant member of the same sex, the only one of the group with the right to exhibit his/her sexuality openly.
risk factors if adolescent dogs do not undergo hierarchization-satellisation, they gain hierarchy - access to the privileges of the dominant member.
nothing, however, enables us to affirm or deny that rapid habituation to close stimuli cannot be achieved after 12 weeks.
the puppy learns to make an empathetic link between the opponent's squeal and the pain invoked.
- behavioural epigenesis is influenced by environmental factors, by the surroundings.
the sheltie, on the other hand, develops a strong hierarchy in defending the nest (spatial-territorial) and submissive members (females) are pushed inside the nest.
an aggression-inhibition relationship - a dominant-submissive hierarchization - is then established between the mother and puppy for access to the mother's teats.
this breed has been shown to "respect" (accept) the female's priority to food.
the presence of the mother is thus favorable, even necessary, for the development of appeasement-submission rituals and for the puppy's hierarchization in the adult pack.
these conflicts revolve around access to the opposite sex (intra- or interspecific), but they can also arise over occupation of certain areas of the group's common space (in the house in cases of conflicts with the dog's owners, and rarely outdoors), in particular feeding and sleeping areas.
risk factors feeding a puppy solely on standardized food, invariable in taste and appearance (dry or moist) can lead to long-term preferences and rejection of other types of food (this has been clinically proven in cats).
the lack of comprehensible appeasement rituals favors attitudes of competitive aggression (sociopathy) or substituting behavior (sometimes self-directed).
in birds fear of the unknown is delayed when they are raised in isolation; this phenomenon thus appears to depend on experience rather than maturing of the nervous system (mcfarland, 1981) - one must first be able to refer to something "known" before fearing the unknown.
likewise for emotional and relational homeostasis we could also envisage the existence of a "sensoriostat ", "thymostat" or "sociostat" respectively measuring a being's sensorial perception, and emotional and social equilibrium.
a dog's tactile capacities develop before birth, and it is possible that it already becomes used to contact in the uterus, when the mother is petted.
in dogs, precocious neutering can delay or preclude the emergence of wariness towards strangers (brunner, 1968, in fox, 1978), which could possibly confirm the tendency's hormonal cause.
the fights become ritualized, a sign that stable hierarchical relations are being established.
in conclusion: this period leads to food hierarchization among litter-mates from 5 to 15 weeks (occasionally later), between puppies and adults from 4 ± ½ months, and reutilization of submissive postures (dorsal-lateral decubitus) towards adults (from 5 weeks) and appeasement postures(nibbling the chop and extending the paw) from 8 weeks.
the acquirer (when he receives the 7-9 week old puppy) must then respect these socio-ecological conditions - he must limit the space available when the puppy is not under human control and provide the adequate elimination medium (why not a large litter box in an apartment?) placed at the right location (at least 2-3 meters from where the puppy eats and sleeps).
these risks are avoided when dog owners behave in a way that can be assimilated to the parent-dog relationship.
in birds fear of the unknown is delayed when they are raised in isolation; this phenomenon thus appears to depend on experience rather than maturing of the nervous system (mcfarland, 1981) - one must first be able to refer to something "known" before fearing the unknown.
lastly, stimulus-poor puppies run the risk of developing hyper-attachments to their biological or adoptive parents (transposition of hyper-attachment to its new human masters), which is a source of intolerance to isolation, attention-seeking behavior, reutilization of behavior acquired during illnesses, etc.
we have seen that hierarchization occurs during a first "food" phase between puppies (from 5 weeks and is practically established, depending on the breed, between 3 to 12 months), then between adults and puppies (around 4 ± ½ months).
these experiments enable us to deduce that when a gestating pet is given a friendly and caring human environment (with affectionate physical contact), the domestication and emotional balance of her offspring is facilitated, as compared with an environment where there is no contact and interaction with people.
in conclusion: "industrial" kennel conditions suffice to cause anxiety and inhibition (undoubtedly favored in this case by the breed and enclosure in a 9m² cage).
in other words, fear of the unknown has both an emotional and behavioral phase (starting around 5 weeks) and acognitive phase (near puberty).
in rodents always, precocious exposition to other species odors eases future interspecific socialization (decrease in aggressions, lowering of corticosteroïds hormones) (caston: 1993).
some breeds have a greater tendency to bark than others (hounds, poodles, yorkshires, etc.).
*in rodents, postnatal temporary occlusion of the ears leads to subsequent difficulties to locate sounds in space and to reduction of discrimination of auditive patterns (caston: 1993).
from 7 weeks on puppies of a litter occasionally form groups to gang up on a lone puppy.
the result is frames of reference acquired for each isolated or grouped sense (multi-sensorial referential, or tolerance level (according to fox, 1975), or even "thymostat"), since each referential is probably a "mental object" identified by an activated assembly of neurons, according to changeux, 1983).
when they have learned some behavior, they reproduce it even when the rewarding factor has been removed (lack of the extinction process).
from the age of 5 weeks the puppies begin to growl to gain possession of their food.
when they have learned some behavior, they reproduce it even when the rewarding factor has been removed (lack of the extinction process).
since no interaction is possible with a mirror image, this seems to be a poor substitute for suitable "imprinting".
the main phases in neurological development like humans, dogs belong to a species that matures slowly after birth: the new-born is not completely developed and is incapable of surviving on its own.
according to klosovskii (1963), puppies and kittens that undergo periods of forced rotation for several days have vestibular neurons that are larger than those of animals that have not received this stimulus (in fox: 1965).
the puppies share and fight over what is left, and gobble it up rapidly, to the complete indifference of the dominant members who return to other activities.
here we can directly see the overall differences between a city and rural environment of development.
clinical practice shows that when a puppy is acquired at 6 weeks this is already a handicap in developing its adult social and sexual preferences.
nonetheless, you can talk about acoustic sensitivity in individuals or breeds.
woolpy (1968, in fox, 1975) accustomed adult wild wolves to contact with humans in 6 months' time; he then isolated them somewhat from humans: in this case they retained their socialization experience.
as cyrulnik wrote, "the world of each animal is built around the double constraint of genetics and development".
in this single-breed kennel (little variation in genotype) in a relatively deprived sensorial environment, there was a high degree of phenotype variation with, nevertheless, a large percentage (more than 50%) of dogs displaying inhibited behavior (more than 75% of the dogs were anxious).
it is thus the dog breeder who conditions the location and medium favored for elimination.
a family of briards (brie sheep-dogs) displayed the same tendency, despite differences in the surroundings in which they were raised.
the dog's particular nature - a puppy has to learn to identify its own species - can serve to foster socialization with other species (called domestication when it involves interaction with humans).
- the role of the veterinarian is essential because he/she sees the animal from 6 to 16 weeks for its vaccinations.
pageat explains this as follows: in a dog-pack, adolescent males at puberty are pushed to the fringe of the group (by the alpha male and the other older males).
various measurements (volume, weight, percentage of dry matter, oxygen consumption) of the brain show that growth is rapid until the 6-7th week when development suddenly slackens considerably.
a stressful environment (feral dog) will close this phase ahead of time (probably around 7 to 9 weeks).
fox (1978) studied primary and secondary socialization in wild dogs and other canines that were raised in identical environments and had daily contact with the trainer and intermittent contact with unfamiliar humans.
choosing a bold puppy (to avoid adopting a seemingly unsociable one who stays at the back of the cage) may thus mean selecting a dog that will be more aggressive to other dogs.
an arbitrary limit can thus be set for spontaneous socialization to another species, during afirst encounter, at 12 ± 2 weeks.
an arbitrary limit can thus be set for spontaneous socialization to another species, during afirst encounter, at 12 ± 2 weeks.
if guide dogs for the blind are placed in a foster family at 12 weeks, they generally adapt well, but placement at 14 weeks can prove to hinder performance in later training (scott and fuller, 1965).
the occipital cortex, however, then grows more rapidly than the motor and frontal lobes; it also contains several immature neuroblasts that reach full development only around 3 weeks of age (fox, 1965).
during the sensitive period, a small number of determining experiences have major effects (or damages) on future behavior.
according to charles and fuller (1956) (in scott and fuller: 1965) the alpha rhythm that appears at 21 days signals an activation of the sense of sight.
- the human tends to fear for the puppy's health and thus pays particular attention to its appetite, watching it while it eats, indulging it when it begs, worrying about finicky appetites or loss of appetite, varying food, and hand-feeding, which become invested with the social symbol of dominance.
elimination behavior (1) is preceded by sniffing around, probably in search of typical odors (urine, feces, chlorine, ammonia, etc.) that will spark the elimination reflex, (2) occurs almost every waking hour, (3) is not activated for several hours during sleep.
a dog views human behavior through the social lens of its own species and attempts to gain privileges as high as possible on the hierarchical scale.
the same holds for dogs: when a normally socialized puppy is isolated from humans and placed in a kennel from 3-4 months of age to 6-8 months he becomes fearful in the presence of humans, even the trainer.
ducklings become attached to their mother between the 13th and 16th hour of life (hess 1959, in cyrulnik 1989), it takes 5 minutes of contact during the first hour after birth for a she-goat to become attached to the odor of her kid (bateson, 1981), and a ewe needs contact within 4 hours after the birth of her lamb.
i also participated in a study on the effects of a serotoninergic psychotropic drug on the behavior of beagles raised in a kennel.
the fight is rarely traumatic since adult fighting capacities are as yet undeveloped.
he/she thus theoretically has several occasions to assess the puppies' early emotional and behavioral development and can recommend preventive measures and training techniques.
activity regulates neuronal development.
a fox terrier puppy (male) raised in complete isolation and introduced to other dogs at 16 weeks displayed inhibited behavior and was attacked by the other puppies that were normally socialized.
note that canines are perfectly capable of distinguishing the sex of humans, even when they are dressed alike; this is probably through their sense of smell.
a dog views human behavior through the social lens of its own species and attempts to gain privileges as high as possible on the hierarchical scale.
in 4 days time her behavior was indistinguishable from that of the other puppies (scott and fuller, 1965).
from 7 weeks on puppies of a litter occasionally form groups to gang up on a lone puppy.
the relative absence of human contact leads to relative handicaps, such as fear/wariness/phobia towards a type of human (children, men,...).
the same experiment on adult monkeys showed no effect on vision.
these conflicts revolve around access to the opposite sex (intra- or interspecific), but they can also arise over occupation of certain areas of the group's common space (in the house in cases of conflicts with the dog's owners, and rarely outdoors), in particular feeding and sleeping areas.
it reproduces the same characteristics as the second phase, only this time with all the weapons, strength and passions of a mature adult.
the more "aggressive" the litter (line, breed), the greater the tendency for linear hierarchization.
weaning-detachment and (food) hierarchization a mother's care and attachment towards her puppies are strongest during the first 3 weeks of life, and after that progressively recede.
the result is frames of reference acquired for each isolated or grouped sense (multi-sensorial referential, or tolerance level (according to fox, 1975), or even "thymostat"), since each referential is probably a "mental object" identified by an activated assembly of neurons, according to changeux, 1983).
a bibliographic study confirms there is a phylogenetic and/or epigenetic tendency for pre-puberty sensitization.
active nerve endings are eliminated all the while the nervous system itself is expanding...
a fox terrier puppy (male) raised in complete isolation and introduced to other dogs at 16 weeks displayed inhibited behavior and was attacked by the other puppies that were normally socialized.
from the age of 5 weeks the puppies begin to growl to gain possession of their food.
this behavior is provoked by pressing on the sternum or the stomach.
male chihuahuas raised by cats until 16 weeks of age demonstrate preference for the presence of cats, and submission - or fear - in the presence of dogs (they also show no reaction to their reflection in a mirror).
a family of briards (brie sheep-dogs) displayed the same tendency, despite differences in the surroundings in which they were raised.
woolpy's interpretation (for wolves) is that socialization is limited by fear of the unknown.
from 11 to 15 weeks play-fighting recedes; it becomes less aggressive and more controlled.
*in rodents, postnatal temporary occlusion of the ears leads to subsequent difficulties to locate sounds in space and to reduction of discrimination of auditive patterns (caston: 1993).
on the other hand, puppies raised in a family from 4 weeks of age (becoming used to dogs, cats and/or children), without renewed contact with the laboratory dogs, show greater familiarity with people than with dogs.
their activity level is 6 times higher than average dogs raised in normal surroundings ( motor hyperexcitement).
as the effects of the psychotropic drug were not significantly demonstrated compared to that of a placebo, the evolution towards 'normal'
at 12 weeks a puppy is easily frightened.
note that, unlike goats and sheep, adult dogs show no parental rejection of their young!
fox (1975) experimented with puppies placed in contact with increasingly complex stimuli (enrichment) at 5, 8, 12 and 16 weeks: as they grow the puppies tended to seek out complex environments.
a dog encouraged to pull at objects it holds in its jaws reinforces the biting reaction, which is undesirable in a family pet (although it may be useful for police and guard dogs).
one factor favorable to emotional and relational well-balance of a dog that must live with humans in a city context is enrichment in the breeding environment.
pageat explains this as follows: in a dog-pack, adolescent males at puberty are pushed to the fringe of the group (by the alpha male and the other older males).
in conclusion: this period leads to food hierarchization among litter-mates from 5 to 15 weeks (occasionally later), between puppies and adults from 4 ± ½ months, and reutilization of submissive postures (dorsal-lateral decubitus) towards adults (from 5 weeks) and appeasement postures(nibbling the chop and extending the paw) from 8 weeks.
that this process is essentially learned, rather than genetically acquired is a sign of the species' ability to conquer - and adapt to - varied and new environments.
- it is the breeder's role is to ensure temperamental selection and to enrich the development environment (under veterinary guidance).
living in a group and adapting to varied environments calls for a certain degree of emotional equilibrium (with minor fluctuations).
a dog's epigenesis engenders multiple temperaments that can be partially foreseen by controlling its environmental stimuli.
at8½ weeks it defecates in specific spots, usually at a distance from its eating and sleeping area.
at8½ weeks it defecates in specific spots, usually at a distance from its eating and sleeping area.
through species identification a puppy is able to recognize its parents ( filial imprinting), and develop preferential intraspecific social relations (fraternal imprinting) and the relations (sexual imprinting ) which mean the survival of the species (filial and sexual imprinting).
the rising curve reflects aprogressive attachment to a familiar place (attachment location) while the descending curve after 7-8 weeks is a sign ofemotional maturing (more than habituation) and motivation to explore the unknown.
when they are placed with other dogs at 16 weeks, they recover intraspecies socialization in two weeks; they now prefer dogs to cats and react to images of themselves in a mirror (fox, 1971, in pieters 1984).
the prenatal period pregnant rats that have been placed under stress or injected with acth or adrenaline give birth to young rats that are emotive and perform less well than a control group.
confinement and hand feeding enable it to accept contact with its laboratory handler(s) but not with strangers, and it still prefers the presence of dogs to that of humans (scott and fuller, 1965).
the relationship risks reverting to one with a demanding-dominant dog and a obedient-submissive owner.
- the trainer must not only inculcate the bases for instrumental learning, he/she must also take advantage of having a group of dogs to continue their socialization and avoid de-socialization, both towards other dogs and towards humans.
feeding food conditioning studies have been conducted on cats that became vegetarian or imitated their mother who ate bananas.
the referentials that come into play are level of noise, visual agitation, intensity of olfactory stimulation, number of vibrations, occupation of three-dimensional space, flexibility or rigidity of movements, etc.
behavior could be imputed to the effects of the experiment itself, since the dogs were tested every other week (5 minutes maximum per dog) and given medicine twice a day.
in other cases the windows close when a new point is reached.
aggressivity was directed toward males (canines and humans).
woolpy's interpretation (for wolves) is that socialization is limited by fear of the unknown.
during the sensitive period, a small number of determining experiences have major effects (or damages) on future behavior.
some breeds have a greater tendency to bark than others (hounds, poodles, yorkshires, etc.).
the growth of the nervous system underlies behavioral epigenesis.
elimination elimination is a reflex present at birth (it is provoked when the mother licks the puppy's perineum) and becomes spontaneous around2-3 weeks.
some puppies nonetheless manage through appeasement rituals to grab some food and escape with it to a corner.
the immaturity of the nervous system at birth is obvious: cragg (1975) calculated that in cats the number of synapses per cortical neuron grows from a few hundred to nearly 12,000 in the 10th to 35th day after birth (in changeux, 1983).
when they are placed with other dogs at 16 weeks, they recover intraspecies socialization in two weeks; they now prefer dogs to cats and react to images of themselves in a mirror (fox, 1971, in pieters 1984).
wariness of strangers develops: quickly in the solitary species (from 4 months in foxes), later in species of average sociability (around 1 year for jackals and coyotes), and much later in social species such as wolves (between 6 and 18 months) or dogs (beagle, pointer or chihuahua - between 1 and 2 years).
experiments by cyrulnik with cats have shown that attachment depends on the cholinergic system; anti-cholinergics block the attachment process.
each puppy was taken from the surrounding in which it was raised, placed in contact with humans for one week, and again tested.
puberty and hierarchization dogs are social animals that need company, living in a hierarchical pack (or family-pack).
the flight reaction does not develop; instead only inhibition or fear-provoked aggression develop (fisher, 1955; fuller, clark, walker, 1960 in scott and fuller, 1965).
the number of brain cells and their myelination reaches full adult maturity at 4 weeks.
in the absence of siblings, a puppy establishes identification through care-giving, care-searching and/or playful interaction with its parents or other dogs.
we have seen that hierarchization occurs during a first "food" phase between puppies (from 5 weeks and is practically established, depending on the breed, between 3 to 12 months), then between adults and puppies (around 4 ± ½ months).
an animal that is badly imprinted is lost for the species.
interspecific socialization counters predatory behavior towards the type of attachment individual.
the presence of other species during this period does not hamper identification with one's own species.
thus before socialization can be acquired, the subjective (cognitive) element of fear must first mature.
this short contact, however, is not enough for basenji puppies; this variability is thus truly linked to breed (genetics)
human skin is more fragile than a dogs.
in clinical practice we have observed dogs acquired at 3 or 4 months that had phobic behavior, whereas their siblings, acquired at 2 months, were emotionally balanced.
- and lastly, failure to develop a dog's general motor control encourages hyperkinetic forms of behavior.
here are a few examples: christy, a female puppy, was raised in complete isolation from other dogs by the "colony" of students at the jackson laboratory.
the lack of human contact between 3 and 12 ± 2 weeks fosters the development of fear/wariness of humans (feral dog).
risk factors clinical observation shows that when some puppies are limited to one spot and medium until the age of 15 weeks (puppies kept in the house and elimination on newspapers, for example) it becomes almost impossible for them to learn to use other media and locations (conditioning) and they retain themselves for hours when walking outside until they can eliminate on their preferred medium and spot.
the redundancy is temporary.
the dog's relation with its master thus becomes ambivalent, withconflicting messages: demands (dominance) - tolerance (submission).
choosing a bold puppy (to avoid adopting a seemingly unsociable one who stays at the back of the cage) may thus mean selecting a dog that will be more aggressive to other dogs.
- behavioural epigenesis (ethogenesis) is linked to the way neuronal connections areorganised (theory of selective stabilization ).
some puppies nonetheless manage through appeasement rituals to grab some food and escape with it to a corner.
at the start of the experiment, all the dogs tested between 4 to 10 points.
the second phase of hierarchization, puberty, is sexual, social and zonal-spatial.
clinical observation has also confirmed that it is easier to transfer from an environment with a high level of stimulation (city) to an environment with a low level (rural) than the contrary.
in exactly identical conditions, with limited human contact (kennel staff) it was easy to choose 16 dogs of 8 - 13 months in which the following symptomatic behavior towards the presence of humans could be observed: -expectancy posture (pageat, 1986) (locomotor inhibition, almost crouching, tail between the legs, head extended towards the stimulus presented), refusing, or cringing from, hand contact, lack of interest or catatonic immobility in the presence of a colored moving object, inhibited movements outside the kennel (limited city noise).
in clinical practice we have observed dogs acquired at 3 or 4 months that had phobic behavior, whereas their siblings, acquired at 2 months, were emotionally balanced.
they learn slowly and forget easily (every trial is like a new experience).
an animal that is badly imprinted is lost for the species.
let's look at a few experimental cases: puppies raised in a semi-open environment in (nearly) complete isolation from humans reacted differently towards an active unfamiliar observer depending on their age.
in exactly identical conditions, with limited human contact (kennel staff) it was easy to choose 16 dogs of 8 - 13 months in which the following symptomatic behavior towards the presence of humans could be observed: -expectancy posture (pageat, 1986) (locomotor inhibition, almost crouching, tail between the legs, head extended towards the stimulus presented), - refusing, or cringing from, hand contact, - lack of interest or catatonic immobility in the presence of a colored moving object, - inhibited movements outside the kennel (limited city noise).
this problem can be avoided by giving the puppy a variety of food.
- a dog encouraged to pull at objects it holds in its jaws reinforces the biting reaction, which is undesirable in a family pet (although it may be useful for police and guard dogs).
in females, progesterone favors territorial defense behavior, just as it favors whelping and pseudocyesis.
in the absence of siblings, a puppy establishes identification through care-giving, care-searching and/or playful interaction with its parents or other dogs.
nevertheless a mere daily contact, and handling every other week were enough to lower the level of inhibition and anxiety in this group of young adult dogs significantly.
the human desire to give and receive attention is opposed to the normal (agonistic) parental behavior to wean the puppy, detach oneself and encourage autonomy.
the neonatal period we will only say a few words about this period, which arbitrarily ranges from birth to the opening of the eyes at approximately 13 days.
at about 16 weeks the puppies must take their place in line for food, i.e. after the dominant and sub-dominant members, almost last.
learning to control the intensity of its bite is actually part of a puppy's growing generalcontrol of its movements, enabling it to adopt postures and facial mimics which become the prevalent form of communication in animals having highly developed brains.
since puppies do not have such short periods of facilitated learning, we will use the term sensitive period.
that this process is essentially learned, rather than genetically acquired is a sign of the species' ability to conquer - and adapt to - varied and new environments.
these play-fights also lead to a certain hierarchization of relations (less than 25% among litter-mates at 5 weeks of age)
discussion and conclusions no quantitative studies have been made on intra-breed variability, and inter-breed studies have only concerned a few family lines in selected breeds.
in a now classic experiment (by weisel and hubel from 1963, in changeux 1983) with monkeys, noticeable visual defects were caused when one eye was sewn shut during the first six weeks of life; the problems were reversible if the eye was re-opened after three weeks' time.
