in my view, animals are never deceitful, dishonest, manipulative, or malicious unless they are severely provoked or are in the wild, where darwinian influences matter.animals are often able to forgive humans for unspeakable treatment.it is my hope in my daily work as an animal doctor that i honor that trust and express my gratitude to them for their enrichment of the world in which those of us blessed to know animals live.i can't imagine that animals would ever take up hunting humans simply to entertain themselves, yetÂ hunting remains a popular "sport" among humans.i can't imagine that animals would ever take up hunting humans simply to entertain themselves, yet hunting remains a popular "sport" among humans.on some level, i find this a sad reflection on the nature of my relationships with humans, and i acknowledge that i'm simply more comfortable around animals than i am around people.my trust in animals softens the harshness and disappointment that my interactions with humans occasionally bring.i believe that animals are devoid of all of the malevolence that people inflict on each other.his characterization of animals behaving more like people violated my lofty beliefs.each of us could easily recite the myriad reasons that our animal companions hold such a special place in our hearts.i can seldom recall feeling let down in a similar manner by an animal.i suspect that if i had to choose between spending the next year on an island with either 10 random humans or an equal number of dogs and cats, i'd be looking for dog and cat food.all animals deserve respect, unfortunately i am starting to feel that not all humans deserve respect.i realized it was because he imbued all the animal characters with the aforementioned odious human qualities, which he apparently thought that we would find humorous.people have on numerous occasions caused me to feel disappointment and betrayal.
