they usually control the owners and become a dedicated part of the family.and both species have survived this long in the world so both have very good survival instincts.how can somebody say a dog isn't that smart because it will only listen to commands and act based on reward, are they not doing exactly what humans do when they were trained/taught for society.in my opinion and only mine, i do think dogs are smarter because they fit the criteria that i use when judging an animals mentality.cats can be stuck out in the wild and survive.just because a dog is much more trainable than a cat does not mean he/she is smarter.dogs are just more obiediant and loyal than cats.i think it's individual and that cats are just more independent than dogs are.they are more independent and less easily confused than most dogs i know.also, scientific studies show that the cat brain structure is similar to a humans.also, interdependence and being social is a trait that most humans have so if you want to argue who acts more like humans, dogs would win.a dog does what it is told or acts as if in a pack.one of my cats plays fetch - cats can be trained - they just need the right reward - dogs will do anything for any kind of reward.they manage to get folks to go to great lengths to try and win their affection, while remaining aloof and sometimes downright contemptous of them.to me dogs are smarter,they are able to learn stuff cats can never do...if well trained you can rely on it,but you can never rely on cat..cats do the job to keep my dog kennels free of any rats or mouse...
