my last little dog who died sat almost touching me hours every day while i worked on the computer.
we treat our dogs extremely well.
the cat was just recently dropped off on us.
we didn't think we would be able to handle another one for awhile, but it turns out that it was good for us to get a couple of puppies.
they've been considerable work as puppies - but worth every minute.

none of that kitty-kitty stuff for them.
he turns the touch lamp off at night for me and if i drop something on the floor will get it for me.
they follow us around and want to be with us doing everything.
posting a picture of your dog is just fine.
sometimes they appear to listen and grief with us, know what we need, or enjoy the view.
these little guys have already brought us a lot of joy.
logged be not weary in your serving; do your best for those in need; kindness will be rewarded by the lord who prompts the deed.
when i worked on my truck they would be there watching me.
i fed him mighty dog food and gave him lots of love, and so he managed to grow into a big dog, although the vet said he would be beagle sized.
my dogs and i explored the woods in winter and summer.
i love walking in the woods and enjoy the company of a big dog.

many of our dogs have lived to over 15, and that's pretty old for a dog.
trained not to harm animals we both gazed with wonder at deer and baby fawns, groundhogs, and turkeys and even fish in the streams.

i don't get out much because of disability, and he's been a great little companion for me when my wife is gone.
they give us a lot more than we give them.
i would say that the breed information was correct that they are wonderful companion dogs.
it took us awhile to get her over the grieving process of missing my brother but she has become a really great companion, too.
i'm positive that they already love us and we love them.
my little dog i have now has a white face, and he's a big baby.
but i enjoy the fact that if trained well, they listen well and are fun to be around.
she is just a baby but already very well behaved in just a few weeks.
our puppies are already well-established members of the family.
every once in a while though i've found a cat that behaves more like a dog.
we didn't think we would be able to handle another one for awhile, but it turns out that it was good for us to get a couple of puppies.
it was good for them also since they got out of those cages and had two humans to train.
you sound like a person who understands making a dog part of the family.
safety is often an issue anymore and usually people don't miss with you if you have a big dog at your side.
they would greet me at the door just like a dog would.
he was so ill the vet told me he was not expected to live.
we wanted healthy, non-shedding, non-allergenic, loving, companion type dogs that live a long time and are great with small children.
the loss of our last little dog after 18 years was really hard, but we have many special memories.

but, things worked together just right, and we found both breeds we were interested in at the same place - same day.
he cries every time we go anywhere even for a few minutes.
the bichon looks like a white toy poodle, and the shih tzu looks like a small ewok on star wars.
i'm positive that they already love us and we love them.
most of my life i have had pets, birds and turtles, and a few cats, but dogs are better companions.

she has been adopted by our female dog which has never had babies of her own.
dogs enjoy being with people and listen and respond better than cats.
we did some research about breeds and thought it would be some time before we would get another dog.
some who don't understand would say that my wife and i were silly, but i'll just say that we loved them.
watched them grow up, laughed at the silly things they did as kittens, and spent winter evenings helping my favorite cat raid the hen house in search of mice.
i too know the loss of a good dog that spent 10 years by my side.
he even makes a noise like singing from time to time when i pet him, and i do spoil him rotten.
the loss of our last little dog after 18 years was really hard, but we have many special memories.
if i worked in the garden one of them would climb on my shoulder and watch.
i am sure they will bring you such joy, as dogs do.
by the way, your dog is beautiful.
it is pretty heart-breaking when they pass away, but you at least know they had a good home and someone who loved them.
you sound like a person who understands making a dog part of the family.
we get home and he acts like we've been gone for days.
the few cats i had were outside cats we had on the farm.
yes, it's a medical fact that pets are good for us, and i've always thought that was particularly true for dogs.
we treat them really good, and i think that's one of the main reasons why they live so long.
it is pretty heart-breaking when they pass away, but you at least know they had a good home and someone who loved them.
however, the vet never told him.
those who have lost a little dog who was an old friend will understand.
we did lose one beautiful australian shepherd at 5 with congestive heart failure.
the other would even try to help me pull weeds yet even left the plants i wanted alone.
that seemed to help her a lot to get over my brother's absence.
hello brother joey, it's nice to hear from you.
so it was a real blessing to me when he managed to live for ten years.
