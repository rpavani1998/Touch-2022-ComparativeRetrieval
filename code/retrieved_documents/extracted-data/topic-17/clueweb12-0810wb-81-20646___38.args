queen kitty ruled the roost and everyone knew it, so when she died sadie went about life as if nothing had happened and all was perfectly normal.
dr. herron states that, "our study demonstrated that manyconfrontational training methods , whether staring down dogs, striking them, or intimidating them with physical manipulation such as alpha rolls [holding dogs on their back], do little to correct improper behavior and can elicit aggressive responses ."
if you don’t, though, we’ll know where you stand:  you’re ok with abuse to puppies and dogs.
education is key, which is why i am developing a project that will spread the word about dogs and child safety, particularly for new mothers-to-be.
jasmine snuggled up on the chair next to him and all was quiet.

it continues to confound me that there are still proponents of bsl given both the behavioral science which is now available and the abysmal track record of municipalities that have attempted to curb dog attacks by instituting bsl.
i think my mother was secretly hoping that i would meet a prince or the son of a wealthy land owner, but even though there were a few hopefuls, i never really fit in with that social set and much preferred to get into my muck boots and walk my clients’ dogs on wimbledon common.
i believe that dogs should learn just as much from constructive discipline as they do from reward.
that said, it is indeed possible to turn them into deadly weapons if they’re in the wrong hands, just as it is with any breed of dog.
the new shows will start airing in early january and i’m excited because i think this is going to be the best season yet.
baby justin was lying on the bed while his mother went to take a shower when the attack happened.

yes, at about 3 years of age or so, ricky, who seemed perfectly healthy – was diagnosed with feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hcm).
shortly after 9/11 we pulled a very sick maine coon cat from animal control with the intention of nursing her back to health and then putting her up for adoption.
unfortunately, this is another example of why the imposition of our human sensibilities on our dogs does not always translate successfully.
the dog might behave and do what the human asks but only because he has learned that not behaving will cause a negative reaction in his human and that needs to be avoided at all costs.
the only thing harsh punishment does achieve is to make the person feel better because they have gained control even if it meant dominating the dog into submission.
it is so much better to be able to influence an animal’s behavior without using force, which is why positive reinforcement methods really do offer a better alternative to outdated and abusive dominance theory.
for example a dominance trainer will often ‘flood’ a dog who is anxious and aggressive around other dogs, by forcing the dog into a situation where it is surrounded by lots of dogs it doesn’t know, forcing the dog to refrain from responding when inundated with that stimulus the dog fears most until the dog ‘submits’ to the fact that there’s nothing he can do.
the videos and evaluations have shown lennox to have substantial control of his behavior, that he is a sociable and pleasant animal despite his long isolation and confinement away from his home, and that he showed clear restraint when one evaluator pushed him into a trapped area in a threatening manner.
turns out he had put down some mole-killing poison in a section of his backyard where the moles had begun to wreak havoc, and our jasmine had sniffed it out and had one of the pellets in her mouth.
when the dog has finished sniffing and walks away from you, walk slowly away and tell an adult.
jasmine loves my daughter and likes nothing better than to wake her up in the morning, run around with her during the day and fall asleep in her arms at night.
i miss you, dad, and hope that wherever you may be, you are executing the perfect forehand or making your opponents crazy with the drop shots that you were so famous for.
after shooting 4 uk seasons and with the 3rd us season currently airing on animal planet in the us, victoria is thrilled to be returning to the new york metro area again to help dogs and owners achieve balance through her force-free, positive reinforcement dog training methods.

he wished us luck and told us if we made it through the next 24 hours, jasmine should be in the clear.
the last walk he took them on was an abject failure, as it was freezing cold and no one wanted to be outside anyway (including the dogs).
the problem might well be medical – so no amount of behavior modification will help.
i abhor people who hurt and bully others and will fight for justice.
here is the amazing story of a little dog that performed an enormous deed; he saved the life of his owner.
fortunately he had cupped his hand under her mouth and caught most of it in his palm.
she was not housetrained, which means she is now on a toileting schedule.
the evening opened my eyes even more to the incredible cruelty that animals face.
i did not relish the thought of turning up in the morning to find that he had frozen to death, but i did not know how he could possibly make it through another night of below freezing temperatures.
there are also many breeders that will defend their breeding practices by saying that ‘line breeding’, i.e. breeding grandparent to grandchild, cousin to cousin, uncle to niece etc. is ok as long as you are not ‘inbreeding’ (parent to child, siblings etc.)
nothing could be further from the truth so i thought it was time to lay out the facts about positive training and explain why dominance theorists and practitioners have it so wrong.
the message i want to give to the local dog-owning public is knowledge about the dogs, organizing thefido festival, training, seminars for learning dogs’ language, for a growing dog-culture.
either way, though, his case has helped highlight what’s wrong with bsl and we must make sure that his story has not been told in vain.
for this reason i am also organizing a fido festival called “qua la zampa” in barzio (lecco – italy) the 14th of august.
dogs and young children do not mix well and the combination can be a recipe for disaster.
jasmine began to make loud retching noises and as my husband desperately looked around for something to catch what he knew was coming out of her mouth, she vomited.
i also use the learn to earn program to quickly build a bond with any new dog i take in, as a first step for training anxious dogs they can look to their owners for guidance or help in scary situations, and for helping dogs who have lost their family members to guide them into a more structured situation.
where there was fear and sadness, the teachers could once again hear laughter, children running with happy dogs, and kelly elementary school moving towards a new normal.
i guess they missed the fact that the current bill was inspired from the recent rescue of 300 dogs from a north carolina puppy mill.
on tonight's episode, victoria helps a couple whose out-of-control dog has begun to have serioius consequences on their relationship.
i suppose i could have trained an alternative behavior – but people so loved it.
when i first started shooting, positive reinforcement was still the dog training philosophy with the most momentum in terms of educating the public about training methods based on modern behavioral science.
i am devastated at his loss and still can’t quite believe that he is gone.
from may 15th - 21st, i will be joining forces with the american veterinary medical association, the us postal service and other organizations to promote national dog bite prevention week.
the meeting was civil and positive, but it was clear that even though a lot of progress had been made, including work by the kennel club itself, they had to be more aggressive with implementing the changes.
the aggressive behavior might look confident and dominant but there is always an underlying discomfort.
treasure has a way of inspiring all those who meet her, but what she does best is to provide a welcome friend in a sometimes lonely world.
walking the red carpet is always a unique experience.
i’m not big on telling people what they want to hear just for the sake of a few egos, and no one has ever accused me of being too soft on those i don’t necessarily agree with.
obviously, education is the key to stopping this from happening.
my daughter named the dog ben and as we sat with him at the veterinarian he put his head into my lap and went to sleep.
you see, we have this idea that pets should go to the veterinarian when they’re sick only, but that’s not the best way to handle things.
disciplinary techniques such as removal, time outs, taking something of value away, ignoring behavior and interrupting negative behavior with a vocal interrupter can be extremely effective, and i use these techniques on all kinds of dogs with all kinds of issues.
so, you are right there with mom in getting the scoop.
for example, i have heard people say that positive reinforcement trainers only deal with obedience training, but when it comes to severe behavioral issues such as aggression, dominance training methods are the only ones that really work because they are more in tune with a dog’s basic psychology.
i’ve trained countless pit bulls, and have found them to be among the most loyal, smart and trainable dogs i’ve worked with.
i love being challenged, and  when i started filming the show six years ago i certainly never thought that after 120 episodes i would still be able to come up with new ways of doing things.
vs: giorgio, thanks so much for taking the time to chat with us today.
even though attacks of this nature are rare compared to the number of dogs in the united states, one fatality is too many.
when i went to sign the adoption papers, i learned that she’d been impounded four times previously.
as we approach her to stop her from eating, the pace of her chomping speeds up in a desperate effort to get every last scrumptious morsel of green in her gut before running off to the next patch.
i have said in previous articles that i believe people who train their dogs using dominance techniques show a great weakness within themselves.
it is the same for a dog so respect that a dog’s food is her food and you should not go near it.
so many adolescent and adult dogs who were great dogs, really fantastic ones.
i have said in previous articles that i believe people who train their dogs using dominance techniques show a great weakness within themselves.
that is, in the most exciting situations, the dog will jump, but in less exciting situations the dog may just push against the owner, or climb into the owners lap.
i may or may not choose to muzzle a dog that is unknown to me to do this if i have concerns about the body language that i have seen prior to this part of my assessment.
i had left the room to bottle feed the puppies when tyson and my son, joshua, were relaxing in the living room.
this is the story of one such dog that brought comfort to many after a horrific event.
the parents replied that the handler was not to worry because the child had a dog of her own and was therefore great with dogs.
i was attending the expo to receive the ‘excellence in journalism and outstanding contribution to the pet industry’ award.
many people don’t realize this, but in order to reward only the desired behaviors the humans have to be aware of all of their interactions with the dog.
i look forward to getting over to italy very soon and joining forces with you and giorgio in person to help spread the word that there’s a better way to train… positively – and that the concept of treating animals with the love, respect and trust that they deserve is a common language that we all share, regardless of nationality.
it is vital, however, that behavioral therapy and management are always given along with any medications in order to give the dog the best possible chance of rehabilitation.
duffy is not the sort of veterinarian that over dramatizes a situation and is always positive and encouraging, but when i saw the worried look on his face, i knew that this was a very serious situation and if the treatment didn’t work we might lose our precious girl.
and the public drink it up, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on these puppies only to find they have health problems, behavior problems or they are just too much work.
lennox’s family have done more than required by the law as responsible dog owners who also foster dogs for various northern ireland dog shelters.
he had been much too smart to go into the trap, preferring to sleep on the outdoor chairs instead.
many dog trainers in italy know victoria stilwell and the “it’s me or the dog” tv show and they are often surprised when i tell them about the vspdt and my membership.
do not take a bone or toy away from a dog if she is playing with it.
but we've known it for a long time, and yet the message isn't effective enough to make a significant difference.
the homeowner who had been feeding the dog welcomed me into her house and showed me where he had been sleeping and eating.
the nra want to protect the rights of hobby breeders, especially those that breed sporting hounds, while the pork council believe that the main goal of this bill’s backers is not so much about puppies but is actually a more sinister plot to eventually force the entire country to stop ever eating meat again!
the general theme is that the ultimate responsibility lies with the parents and/or dog owners, not the children.
the overwhelming majority of video evidence i saw supports the family’s claim that despite the incredibly challenging conditions he’s been forced to live in for the past year, lennox remains an innocent dog.
so as i’m giving thanks this thursday i thank god for my family, for having the chance to work with amazing animals and for giving me the opportunity to help show people in fifty countries the power of force-free training through my show.
all three wardens were found to have lied under oath, but even this did not stop the judge from reaching his decision.
for example, a cat who paws at the tv whenever and only when justin beiber is on.
so these trainers would say you had to wait until the dogs was mature enough.
appearing on espn's first take, a.j. was interviewed with his chihuahua todd to discuss his pride in owning and loving small dogs, despite the fact that he's one of the most fierce football players in the game today (and part of the reason why my husband's atlanta falcons had an early playoff exit).
too often, however, we fall short and fail to understand the intricate yet ultimately simple dynamic that exists between man and dog, transposing our human insecurities and weaknesses onto dogs and assuming that they’re capable of being treated like and judged as four-legged humans.
during this holiday season i think about my wonderful family, how fortunate i have been in my life and career and how lucky i am to have the opportunity to help others through what i do.
for some dogs this can be achieved relatively quickly but for others it can take a while, which is why it is important to see every dog and every situation as unique.
the public gallery looks right over the great room with a bullet proof glass window separating the public from the politicians.
the situation looked hopeless; we had run out of options.
but i see some dogs at crufts and other dog shows that look completely miserable, and if we are to be honest, showing that type of dog is not really for the dog at all.
i was a happy, outgoing child – relatively confident and able to fight my own battles.
the punishment is most likely to work there and then, but the experience of the punishment can make dogs feel more insecure and wary of their owners and it is common for dogs that are punished in this manner to keep reoffending because they haven’t been shown that there is another way to behave.
i seriously think that eric and people like him don’t want to neuter their dogs because not only are they worried how this will look to other people, they themselves will think differently about their dogs if they are castrated.
without extensive behavioural therapy and management strategies, phobias become deeply ingrained and even harder to change.
nevermind the bollocks posted by victoria stilwell - 04/21/11 at 08:04:07 am -41 comments since last week's episode of it’s me or the dog aired in the us featuring eric and his presa canario caspar, i have been inundated with people asking if eric listened to my advice and finally had caspar neutered.
if lennox intended to harm david ryan he could have easily bitten him while he lunged, before mr. ryan had time to react, but lennox chose to warn him (a complete stranger) out of his space instead, rather than inflict harm, and this was impressive to see…… lennox showed impressive restraint and lunged at david ryan with the intent to warn him to go away from him, without harming him.
but think about it – most aggressive response is not a dog’s attempt to usurp others, but a demonstration of a lack of confidence and insecurity.
celebrating and perpetuating a strict set of rules constituting breed conformation means that many breeds of dogs live with disabling physical characteristics and hereditary diseases that can cause acute suffering and in some cases premature death.
when her facebook page reached more than 20,000 incredibly supportive fans, she wanted to help even more people/animals and started "raise awareness wednesdays.”
i’m not condoning the vicious sport of bull baiting, long since banned (thank goodness), but our english bulldogs these days couldn’t take on a fly let alone a bull.
i started to find notes in my desk that contained unpleasant comments and threats towards me and my family.
no amount of food can disguise this behaviour and giving food to a dog with aggression issues can be extremely dangerous.
i shall win the battle in a much gentler but clever way throughout training.
whatever you decide to do, a reward is going to make learning fun for your dog, improve her confidence and build up a strong bond between you.
a dog should never be bribed into doing something for food but should obey their owners because they want to make their owners happy.
punishing that insecurity just serves to increase the insecurity even more.
on february 28th 2010, ashlynn was attacked and killed by a dog.
she is five years old with the most appealing eyes you have ever seen and the kindest nature.
chances are if you’re smart and want to survive, you are going to shut down and not do anything until you are out of that situation and in your comfort zone again.
if it's the latter, however, i have no patience for these people and view their rationale and motivations for such behavior as a sign of tremendous insecurity and weakness.
i’m not big on telling people what they want to hear just for the sake of a few egos, and no one has ever accused me of being too soft on those i don’t necessarily agree with.
no, they’ll end up in a shelter.

i’ve tried my command leave it, ignoring her, giving men treats to entice her, but nothing has worked!
but the most effective way to reduce the number of dangerous dogs is to stop irresponsible owners from raising their dogs to be aggressive, intimidating potential weapons.
he is neutered, has obedience training, is properly vaccinated and was legally licensed-yet he was summarily seized and has been condemned to die.
moreover introducing the channel to a dog when an owner is present will help provide a positive association between the content and the comfort that the person’s presence provides, making it easier for a dog to cope when their owner leaves.
but i guess i don’t know enough people or have severely misjudged the humane tendencies of human beings at large, because somehow, there are still those who oppose puppy mill reform to the point where they go out of their way to ensure that no new laws are passed to protect dogs from this form of cruelty.
me or the dog is making in helping people build more positive relationships with their pets as well as addressing issues such as pet overpopulation and the importance of spay and neuter.
when a person is attached to that good feeling there is more likelihood of the dog listening and responding to whatever that person asks of him.
for those of you who do not live in atlanta – this was how crazy it got.
jasmine had pooped in the crate.
still he was a tv and radio attraction, appearing on several national tv shows including programs on animal planet as well as “national geographic explorer,” and lots of chicago tv and radio show.
people who get dogs for protection don’t realize how much time and effort it takes to train a dog to do bite work and how much time you have to spend reinforcing the training as well as giving your ‘time bomb’ large amounts of physical exercise and mental stimulation (which of course caspar wasn’t getting).
hard punishments used by dominance trainers are not only cruel but are also potentially dangerous and damage the trust between dog and human.
diseases can be passed through a dog’s intestinal tract and into the feces.
utterly exhausted from his adventure, ben had finally come into the warmth for the first time in at least a week.
i advise owners to walk away from dominance trainers.
as i write this sadie is lying beside me wondering when this new woman is going to take her for a walk.
with only eight snow plows for a city of five million people, the city shut down.
it seems when dogs have behavior problems people are more willing to go the extra mile.
someone told me that this awareness is a sign that i am getting old.
to the contrary, the real value in dogtv can be found in those long hours when we are not around and our dogs are otherwise either completely understimulated or suffering from separation distress.

and every time, we all say and hear the same well-meaning and accurate but tired talking points about how devastating it is, how it could have and should have been avoided, who to blame, who not to blame and what to do about the problem.
eric wanted to own a big powerful dog and was even more excited at the prospect of training that dog for protection, as encouraged by the breeder.
the new owner would release him as soon as he struggled and by day 2 he was learning to growl when held.
i loved acting, walking dogs, riding horses and cycling with my best friend kate and that was all i really needed to be happy.
the feedback was really interesting and showed how these terms can be interpreted in such a broad way.
it was remarkable to think that i was walking in the footsteps of kings, queens and prime ministers who had come before me.
they need terrific drive, huge levels of trainability, and a great desire to work in tandem with a human handler.
punitive training techniques that center on gaining control of your dog by dominating her into obeying can damage the human/animal bond and cause your dog to mistrust you and essentially switch off.
it seems to me that thinking about the dog’s well–being comes second to breed conformation.
the show has been nominated for many different awards but this was a special one because it recognized the contribution thatit’s
what this may do, however, is provide a glimmer of hope that we may appeal to some heretofore unseen shred of humanity in the legal decision-makers of this case to spare lennox’s life by allowing him to be relocated to a jurisdiction that does not practice such draconian methods.
"boo remained calm as i panicked.
myth: positive reinforcement trainers only use food as rewards, which is a form of bribery.
food also has the power to help a fearful or anxious dog overcome his fears.
jumping while greeting is a great way for a dog to get your attention.
now i don’t have any problem with respectable breeders who breed for the love of their particular breed and are concerned about raising puppies in the best possible way, maintaining a full regard for all their dogs’ mental and physical well-being.
we only had about five inches of snow, but what made the roads so dangerous was the sheet of ice that developed on top of the snow from the freezing rain that fell afterwards.
you might startle him and he could react without thinking and snap at you.
that being said, because readers will just be learning the exercises, and trying to teach their dog at the same time, it will take longer for them.
march is my favorite month not just because things feel new and fresh but because it was the month when my daughter was born.
vs: it certainly is a fantastic book, but i know that most shelters and rescue groups are strapped for money.
pm: we wrote the book to both encourage adoptions and, as importantly, to increase the percentage of successful ones.
as i grew older i worked at the championship as a chauffer, driving players from their hotels to the stadium and during my final year at university i did personal security for all the tennis players including my idols, navratilova and the great steffi graf.
i not only feel sorry for the dogs that such people come into contact with but also sorry for those people for being so misguided.
if a dog is aggressive then often that aggression is attributed to a dog trying to be an ‘alpha dog’ or boss of all the other dogs.
in the meantime, fireworks phobia can be a tough condition to treat, but trying a variety of therapies and techniques can improve a dog’s ability to cope when the big ones come.
now i can tell you that i enjoy eating bacon as much as the next girl from time to time, and a good hearty debate about the right to bear arms is what americans’ right to free speech is all about, but i’m not going to get into that now because it’s not relevant to a blog post about puppy mills.
even at seventy plus years old he looked so handsome in his leather jacket, making the women around him swoon, reminding me of the actor sean connery.
part of our city, country and way of life had been threatened and disrupted, and we needed to help support those who were literally doing the heavy lifting both emotionally and physically.
allowing a dog to foul a public area and not clearing up after it poses a serious health risk to humans and other dogs.
all this excitement usually comes to an unseemly conclusion which usually results in me using my poop bag or two sticks to pull the inevitably stuck, grass-ridden poop from her behind while she looks around at me with a look that says “i kinda think i understand that you’re trying to help me here, but this is really awkward and no fun.”
it was a good thing i did; when we got downstairs my husband was unconscious on the floor.

dog bites in municipalities whose government have instituted bsl legislation have gone up across the board.
what i do have a problem with are people who go out of their way to actively oppose efforts to ensure the well-being of domesticated dogs.

their neighbour, who happens to be a good trainer friend of mine, took her in and knowing that we were looking to adopt a dog, called us with what she thought was the ideal candidate.

licking the face and around the mouth is a learned behaviour in our dogs and particularly prevalent in wolves, our dogs’ ancestors.
after stopping every couple of steps for the mountain of photographers to take your picture, it is time for print, tv, radio and on-line interviews.
if belfast city council and other governments like it really want to keep a community safe, go after the irresponsible owners who either raise their dogs in a violent manner, do not socialize them or integrate them into society in any way, allow their dogs to wander off leash and do not heed any warning signs or make any attempt to curb aggressive behavior.
i use food in an assessment to monitor the dogs stress levels and emotions at all times.
we treat and train dogs with kindness and respect because we know that only through practice, scientific research and discovery can we truly understand a dog’s behavior and help to mould and change it if needed without using forceful or punitive methods.
aggression is therefore deeply rooted in insecurity.

lack of socialization causes fear and insecurity, which is at the very heart of aggressive response.
i have been challenged and tested by the situations i have encountered, but every new experience, however hard, forces me to improve my skills as a trainer and allows me to think outside the box while coming up with new and creative solutions that will benefit the dog and the family.
the family stated that their dog was very friendly and had no previous incidences of aggressive behavior, not even towards their other child, a four year old boy.
misdiagnosing the reason for the aggression and suppressing that aggression with punitive training means that the dog is made even more insecure and that insecurity has the potential to surface again, possibly more violently than before.
it is also important that i talk to alex about what she is and what she is not allowed to do around the dog.
as a responsible pet owner i cautioned that though we may feel the need to love and care for every animal that comes along, it may not always result in what is best for the pet.
for lucy, i didn’t expect that she’d be good for my parents until they also learned how to reward the good behaviors and make sure she didn’t get rewarded for unwanted ones.
the dog might behave and do what the human asks but only because he has learned that not behaving will cause a negative reaction in his human and that needs to be avoided at all costs.

it will be interesting to see if some of the new products i saw being launched at the expo will make it into stores, because if they do, my girls will be very happy.
do not approach a dog from behind or pet a dog directly on the top of his head.
the global pet expo takes place in march every year in orlando and is so large that by the time you have walked the entire floor your feet are aching.

the homeowner who had been feeding the dog welcomed me into her house and showed me where he had been sleeping and eating.
however it continually amazes me that many owners still have very little knowledge about how to deal with their dog’s behaviour.
it doesn’t matter how she did it, this man’s family walked off – and began to hug one another, all in tears.
sy: one aspect of the book is my version of the learn to earn program where the puppy learns that the way he gets what he wants —praise, petting, to go outside, to come inside, to get bits of his meal, to play fetch—is to sit politely and ask you.
i have been challenged and tested by the situations i have encountered, but every new experience, however hard, forces me to improve my skills as a trainer and allows me to think outside the box while coming up with new and creative solutions that will benefit the dog and the family.
food also has the power to help a fearful or anxious dog overcome his fears.
bsl makes innocent dogs the criminals because of how they look, regardless of their actual temperament.
as soon as sadie stepped through the front door we knew she was the dog for us.
we took video footage of every foster and now and again watch the videos we made of the funny characters that stayed in our tiny manhattan apartment.
he or she also needs the humane and effective kind of training that you role model victoria, to be a polite member of the family.
it is also essential that if an owner is present, time be spent with the dog in the safe haven or attention given to the dog if it comes to seek comfort from its owner.
socialization is so important that i cover it in two chapters in the book and show pictures of the various situations and items the puppy must be socialized to.
she came with us everywhere we went and was the first to welcome our baby daughter home.
it seems like every few weeks, a fresh news story about a family pet seriously injuring or killing a baby hits the airwaves.
i also witnessed sarah fisher’s assessment on lennox and, again, most of her assessment won’t be shown because the world would then see how impressive lennox was with yet another complete stranger handling him.
so his physiological response to emotion is the same as ours, which means that our bodies have the same internal reaction to emotions such as fear, joy, excitement etc.  when a dog is suffering from anxiety or fear that provokes a negative behavior such as aggression, then it is sheer foolishness to profess that by punishing a dog, the dog is fixed.
i’d like to take every ceo, manager, worker and middle man that works in the pet store puppy industry to watch all the euthanasias of the dogs that they previously sold.
nine times out of ten the bully is the insecure kid.
she has known the sting of loneliness while waiting in a shelter for someone to notice her.
dog bites in municipalities whose government have instituted bsl legislation have gone up across the board.
therapy dogs bring comfort and companionship to people in all kinds of situations, helping the elderly, the sick and the disabled, relieving their pain and anxiety.
the great thing about using this puppy, lucy as an example within the book is that i can specifically tell people how long it took for her to learn habits such as automatically sitting to go through doors, to get petted and to play fetch.
this blog isn’t about how i helped eric train caspar, but is written to illustrate a real problem that people have (and i’m sorry to be sexist here, but statistically the problem is mostly with men) about neutering their pets.
they are definitely worth trying, and should be done in conjunction with behavior modification.
thankfully the area where the dog was located was not too far away, so i got in my car and drove carefully to the road where the dog had last been seen.
the winner will be selected randomly from all correctly completed contest entries and notified by july 20th, 2011.
while they often have a reputation for being harsh and rude, i've found that they're among the most warm and welcoming people i've ever been around.
so, maybe lucy just did it this time without the hand signal.
food is incompatible with fear and is therefore a valuable tool in modifying a dog’s fear, anxiety and stress.
in fact a responsible person who recognizes the importance of neutering both for health, behavioral and over population problems, is a lot more powerful in my book than a boy or a man that needs a big powerful dog to compliment and extend that part of their anatomy that is so obviously lacking.
in order to treat this aggression the dog will often be ‘put in its place’ with punitive methods such as ‘alpha rolls,’ where a dog is forcibly put onto its back or side and held there by the owner until it submits, so that it recognizes that it is not the alpha.
some may say that the dogs aren’t fearful of a dominance trainer, but when you really look at it, you can see the difference.
when i got him to the hospital his blood pressure was 55/30.
in the palm of his hand lay a nicely rounded ball of poop, her own poop that she had obviously eaten while she was in the crate waiting for him to return from the shower.
anyone can get a dog to behave using punitive training but it takes a real understanding of dog psychology to use discipline effectively without inflicting pain or fear and to guide a dog into not repeating negative behavior while maintaining trust between dog and person.
your dog will still be driven, trainable, workable and lovable without his dangly bits.
i could see his nose twitch as he caught the smell of the food and slowly he edged towards me, never taking his eyes off me as he approached.
i have lots of free downoadable posters on topics ranging from body language in dogs, how to appropriately greet a dog, how kids and dogs should interact, as well as many article and videos on behavior.
lennox was seized, not for behavior, but because he has a particular physical structure.
this may explain in part why my experience with lennox seems to fly in the face of other evidence presented before the courts.
by the end of it my voice was hoarse and my face hurt from smiling so much, but it was great to meet so many people and talk about why events like the genesis awards are so important.
a stick of gum can drop of 50-pound dog – it’s that dangerous.
the dog was fine with people and had never been aggressive to people before.
for 7 years this k9 good citizen has lent her extensive love for humans, intelligence, skills and strong work ethic not only to missing person operations & public demonstrations but to enthusiastically teaching fire-prevention and home-safety practices.
if a dog sees that there are pleasurable consequences for a behavior then he is more likely to repeat the behavior because doing so makes him feel good.
sadie has accepted jasmine into the household and i have noticed that there is a ‘pep’ in sadie’s step as if some of the younger dog’s energy is flowing into her.
myth: positive reinforcement cannot be used on more severe behavioral cases such as aggressive dogs.
when that was done, lennox continued to show many appeasement and pacification signals as well as signaling his stress, such as lip licking and turning his head and body away.

i have no doubt that soon our gentle ben, who survived against all the odds, will find his forever home.
introducing the audio at a low level again and slowly turning up the volume if the dog continues to be relaxed and able to concentrate on playing the game or eating the food allows the dog to habituate to the noise without a fear response.
that means the dog doesn’t get rewarded with the food every time he responds to a cue, but the next time he responds he might just get it.
people who get dogs for protection don’t realize how much time and effort it takes to train a dog to do bite work and how much time you have to spend reinforcing the training as well as giving your ‘time bomb’ large amounts of physical exercise and mental stimulation (which of course caspar wasn’t getting).
the first thing i do with my customers that use choke chains is to remove it and take a harness from my bag.
one night, my husband was sleeping downstairs in our living room; he was unable to use the stairs after his operation.
so basically they’re willing to let their fear of those in support of the bill dictate their stance on whether or not they’re ok letting dogs languish in abject misery in puppy mills.

fact: actually, this is where positive reinforcement methods are most effective.
my daughter alexandra is scared of dogs, possibly from the fact that she has watched mummy training the naughty puppies on tv and in her mind, every dog is a ‘naughty puppy.’
for example many “dog trainers” still use choke chains to teach the dog not to pull on leash and tie the dog till he can’t even breath.
from then on i learned to be direct, to tell the truth and to share my feelings with people i could trust.
the most popular boy in the group told her to leave me alone and that there would be consequences if she didn’t.
it’s an unfortunate fact that some dogs who are rehomed will have separation issues.
my friend laura janssen, director of animal cruelty investigations and cruelty prevention came to help me catch the dog armed with a humane trap that we set that up for the night.
and as you probably know, australian cattle dogs can have a tendency towards aggression if not socialized appropriately.

the dog doesn’t react when it is surrounded by all the other dogs and the technique is therefore labeled a great success – the dog is cured!
this disease is particularly dangerous in puppies.
keeping his calm he cleaned the crate up and went to work in his office.
i have found that these therapies are often not as effective as noise desensitization.

this might be a closet, bathroom or a basement, the best places usually being the ones that have no windows, but with plenty of artificial light (to mask flashes of fireworks).
because the video received so much attention, ricochet started raising funds and awareness for human/animal causes and has raised more than $75,000 in the last 17 months.
i also like to vary rewards so that the dog never knows what is coming next or use what i call ‘multi- motivators’ such as a food/ toy/praise combination for the desired response.
no, i don’t think sadie thinks she has a problem at all – in fact, she seems to be perfectly oblivious to our concern for her well-being.
we left the windows open so that if jasmine did happen to belch up any of the gas it wouldn’t cause any further harm to her or us.

my husband was on dog watch for the day as i was out rescuing a chained pitbull, and he went to take a shower.
line breeding is still classed as inbreeding and it weakens the gene pool considerably.
as we were packing up to leave our friends, we noticed something in jasmine’s mouth.
he was thin and nervous and even though neighbors had been trying for a week to catch him, he would skulk away when approached and not let anyone get close to him.

it’s kind of like what you do – but i don’t wear the high boots and my accent is form chicago.
what this breeder didn’t seem to care about is that his line of pups happens to have some fear reactivity (and believe me it’s not just how they were raised because genetics plays a part) and that teaching an unconfident dog bite work is like giving a toddler a loaded weapon and encouraging him to play with it with the safety off.
what makes dogtv different, however, is its steadfast commitment to providing both an aural and visual environment which is tailored specifically to the needs of today’s domesticated dog.

we were sure that something you could buy at your local garden center wouldn’t be a problem for domestic pets and that even if it weren’t great for her, jasmine couldn’t have eaten enough of it to cause real trouble.
another aspect of dogtv that helps break new ground is the fact that unlike other dog-targeted content, it does not simply attempt to calm the dog which might otherwise suffer from anxiety.
at the end of the day, the decision was made for us when my daughter and i spied jasmine in our local rescue shelter.
it is well documented that dogs improve a person’s health by lowering blood pressure, relieving anxiety and boosting immunity.
he was thirty years older than i was but his energy and enthusiasm was infectious and i never thought of him as an old man.
when i got him to the hospital his blood pressure was 55/30.
when he stops jumping wait for four seconds of four paws on the floor then reward this with your attention in a calm manner.
eric wanted to own a big powerful dog and was even more excited at the prospect of training that dog for protection, as encouraged by the breeder.
the second boxer was a neutered male who was aggressive to some people.

because of the fun and clear instructions, many puppy class instructors have told me they are going to use it for their classes, and at least one large puppy program will be revising their classes to follow theperfect puppy program.
this may progress to an inability to get up, hypersensitivity to stimuli, seizures, respiratory distress, excess salivation, and death.
a positive reinforcement trainer will recognize that most aggression is not a dog trying to be alpha but a dog that is aggressing because it is trying to control situations or stimuli around him that make him feel uncomfortable.

the belfast city council and the judge in charge of lennox’s case watched and heard expert testimony by some very accomplished behaviorists such as the wonderful sarah fisher, but they ultimately appear to have chosen to put more stock in what they heard from a dog handler named peter tallack and some of the dog wardens that took him from the family's home.
i believe that there are many fantastic methods and approaches that can be used to effectively change dogs' behavior, but i also firmly believe that all of those methods have one thing in common - a general basis in the principles of positive reinforcement and force-free training.
by that definition, pet owners do need to develop leadership skills.
things have changed so much now and the grounds are almost unrecognizable from when i was young, but those memories of watching tennis with my father on the most famous court in the world, are very special.
although our pains were different, we went through them together.
the dog was put down less then twenty four hours after the attack had happened, so i don’t believe that he was seen by anyone who was able to evaluate him properly and even if someone had seen him, twenty four hours is not enough time to do a thorough temperament test and an evaluation that would help determine why the attack happened.
if a dog is exhibiting controlling behavior in or out of the home, chances are that he hasn’t been taught how to behave appropriately.
