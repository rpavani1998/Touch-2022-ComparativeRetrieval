multiple cats can often lead to anxiety amongst the pack leading to other health issues that otherwise wouldn't present with a single or pair of cats.there are of course ways to make an ideal living situation for multiple cats: make sure that each cat has their own specific room or place to retreat from the other's.it is possible that more than 1 cat can coexist; however, cats are more likely to have personality conflicts than dogs.cats are independent and very self sufficient.having another cat makes up the difference in love whenever one cat(s) decides to indulge in his/her independence.owning more than one cat when one can barely afford one seems in my opinion both financially and emotionally irresponsible.because our shelters are full and the government seems to think the stray animal population is not their problem, indivduals that are caring and good try to do it on their own.although, admirable financially, emotionally and socially, it is best to leave the care to the shelters rather than taking the responsibility on your own.cats prefer to be independent and have a hard enough time adjusting to another new cat in the household, let alone more than 1.the rule of thumb according to some pet owners is that the affection and need of 1 dog is equivalent to 3 cats.when introducing a new cat to the family, keep him/her in a large crate until he/she is familiar and comfortable with the other cats and vice versa.i often have many customers call who i like to refer to as "collectors" who think that they're doing a charitable cause by rescuing many cats and housing them.if you want to do your part, most shelters welcome donations in the form of volunteer, money and or toys or foods.yes...it would be wonderful if you found a stray and took it to the shelter and it got adoopted but as many of us know, it does not always work that way.i can understand the need to have more than one cat as companionship.
