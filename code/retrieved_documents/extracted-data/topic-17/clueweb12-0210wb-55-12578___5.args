i have not seen the original research document so the conclusions as written up in newspapers may not be completely accurate.
if, as stated, socialisation creates larger brains over millions of years, surely the lion must have the biggest brain of all the cats as it is the only cat that lives in groups except for feral cats who have adapted to this social way of life when there is a food source that feeds the group.
the wild cat has to use its brain more than adomestic cat.
this is what makes it more intelligent and the wildcat hybrids are more intelligent than the wholly domestic cat breeds and moggies.
i would suspect that the wild cat is as intelligent as the wild dog and in any case we have to mention the lion.
if that happened things would dramatically speed up.
of course the dog should also become more intelligent but the dog takes commands unthinkingly.
it is also worth making the point that there is a fairly wide spectrum of intelligence between the cat breeds.
it is said that cats have less sophisticated brains than dogs.
if that happened things would dramatically speed up.
perhaps this attitude will develop into a more questioning approach from the cat and that too will speed up the development of the cat's brain.
we don't hear of dogsforetelling the death of a hospital patient and then comforting the patient, for example.
the human is the most intelligent animal on the planet.
however, i have seen nothing to support the notion that the lion is more intelligent than the solitary tiger.
i am not sure if the study measured intelligence in a complete way and went beyond brain size and problem solving abilities.

the domestic cat is adaptable and now lives with and interacts with his or her human companion.
the domestic cat thinks about it and then does what he or she wants to do.

one last interesting point, research indicates thatintelligent people prefer domestic cats to dogs.
it socialises with other lions.
the human is the most intelligent animal on the planet.
a million years of interaction with intelligent people will do the cat no harm in respect of brain size, i say.
one last interesting point, research indicates thatintelligent people prefer domestic cats to dogs.
indeed the general view is that thetiger fights smarter than the lion.
surely with millions of years of socialisation between cat and human the cat will become more intelligent.
the research was carried out by scientists at the university of oxford.

they also say that members of the dog family are good at problem solving - better than cats.
cat brains are smaller than dog brains because cats are solitary animals and dogs are social animals.

the lion lives in prides.

there is also the intriguing possibility that even if the research is accurate things will change over the next millions of years.
the research was carried out by scientists at the university of oxford.
of course the dog should also become more intelligent but the dog takes commands unthinkingly.
the more active wildcat hybrids are known to be more intelligent than the passive, relatively uninquisitivepersians, for example.
