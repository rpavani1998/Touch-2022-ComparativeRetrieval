the people surveyed explained their opinions with comments such as dogs are more loyal, cats only care about themselves, dogs want to please their owners, and cats are “1,000 times” smarter than dogs.second, there is no doubt that the social organization and communicative behaviors of dogs are much more similar to ours than are those of cats.after an initial stage of being a religious symbol and appreciated for their predatory behaviors that kept rodents out of food stores, cats went through a dark period of being associated with witches and witchcraft that has, unfortunately, never completely left them.we can more easily relate to the appeasement/submissive behaviors of dogs for example (even though we sometimes mistakenly assign “guilt” and other human motivations to them) and the more family like structure of a group of wolves than we can the more solitary life of many cats.these differences in social structure lead us to believe, as reflected in the comment from a poll participant that dogs are “eager to please”.looking at the domestication history of the two species, the latest thinking is that dogs were for the most part wanted for companionship (less likely as a cooperative hunting partner as had been previously thought).more accurately, dogs are more likely to be motivated by social rewards and punishers.as a general rule, dogs will respond more to petting and verbal praise; angry voices and threatening gestures than do cats.then become a member of ourbehavior education network ( www.behavioreducationnetwork.com) which makes scientific education about pet behavior quickly and easily accessible to both pet professionals and pet lovers.as a cat lover who once trained a mongrel from a dog pound thoroughly enough for her to pass the akc “companion dog” obedience test, i would like it very much if the internecine “dog versus cat” war would cease.the survey also found that 60% of adult said they liked both cats and dogs.consider the breeds with reputations for being aloof – such as basenjis and akitas, and compare that with many orange tabby male cats, who also have reputations for being extremely sociable – our late, great buffett being one.what’s unfortunate about this survey is that the data from non-pet owners weren’t reported separately.if the catholics and protestants in northern ireland can give it a rest, then so can american dog and cat owners.i prefer cats, but enjoy the occasional company of well-behaved dogs.
