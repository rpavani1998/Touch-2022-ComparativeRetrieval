we wanted healthy, non-shedding, non-allergenic, loving, companion type dogs that live a long time and are great with small children.yes, it's a medical fact that pets are good for us, and i've always thought that was particularly true for dogs.dogs enjoy being with people and listen and respond better than cats.we treat them really good, and i think that's one of the main reasons why they live so long.most of my life i have had pets, birds and turtles, and a few cats, but dogs are better companions.i don't get out much because of disability, and he's been a great little companion for me when my wife is gone.it is pretty heart-breaking when they pass away, but you at least know they had a good home and someone who loved them.but i enjoy the fact that if trained well, they listen well and are fun to be around.sometimes they appear to listen and grief with us, know what we need, or enjoy the view.i would say that the breed information was correct that they are wonderful companion dogs.we treat our dogs extremely well.but, things worked together just right, and we found both breeds we were interested in at the same place - same day.we did lose one beautiful australian shepherd at 5 with congestive heart failure.safety is often an issue anymore and usually people don't miss with you if you have a big dog at your side.i love walking in the woods and enjoy the company of a big dog.
