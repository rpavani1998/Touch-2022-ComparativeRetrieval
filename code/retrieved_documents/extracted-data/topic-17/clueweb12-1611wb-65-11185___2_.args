i feel sure that anyone who has known a dog with a good temperament, which has been properly brought up, will have come to appreciate just what companionship and affection that dog can offer us, in our own lives.they were used as guard dogs, and, of course to help with the flocks, but they were basically regarded as unclean, and there is certainly no biblical record of dogs as pets.after all, they have to be quite self-absorbed, with all that responsibility to keep themselves clean, and safe ,too, wherever possible.so let's never forget to thank god for his wisdom, in giving us animals to live with us, to be our trusted and trusting friends, with the capacity, also, to have some way of communicating with us, and sharing much of our lives.but they are still a delight, and to be fully accepted and trusted by a cat is really a lasting joy.of course they do sometimes misbehave – or should it be called 'trespassing'?- but they are sorry and ask forgiveness, with no attempt at justification, and certainly no questioning, or resentment.they are often very affectionate, and give us companionship as well, but whereas a dog is believer in us, i think a cat – not an atheist, for sure, but perhaps bit of an agnostic.it was an elderly priest i once knew, who spelt all this out to me, and i also remember how he added that it was easier for dogs than it is for us, because whereas a dog lives in the presence of his god, and can demonstrate his love and his dependence directly, we cannot see our god, and can only make contact with him through prayer.i think it was through him that i learned to love dogs, and it was with great joy that i first got my own spaniel, for my eleventh birthday.there is quite a lot we can learn from our dogs.you could say that we are to dogs, as god is to us, and they give us a picture of faithfulness, and obedience, which we might well see as an example of how we ourselves ought to be, in our relationship with god.it was my father's dog that i first knew; he was an irish setter called rambler, and he was a fantastic dog.create an account search the bible, see how the bible is changing lives and find out about the bible dogs and cats written by christine canti wednesday, 09 july 2008 21:09we always had a cat as well; they were always called dinah, and i was quite fond of them too, but it was nothing personal, like it was with rambler.and as for cats, we come across lions and leopards in the bible, but no word about cats, even though i believe they were actually worshipped in egypt.
