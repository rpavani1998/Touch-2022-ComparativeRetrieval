that would give dogs an edge in the housepet wars; but an evil white persian named mr. tinkles (voiced by sean hayes) has a clever scheme that would give cats the ascendancy by instead making everybody allergic to all dogs.

unlike shrek and doctor dolittle 2, both of which relied on  low humor and off-color jokes,cats and dogs is good, clean fun, only  occasionally slipping in material that might seem crass in another film but  somehow works here.
what it does have is a comparable level of rollicking energy, along with  some real laughs along the way.

cats and dogs may be playing the same game as spy kids, but it  isn’t in the same league.
the zany slapstick  violence is in the classic old warner-brothers cartoon tradition, and much of  the humor stems from familiar animal traits.
for one thing, it lacks the inspired set and  prop design that elevated the earlier film to luminous eye candy.
