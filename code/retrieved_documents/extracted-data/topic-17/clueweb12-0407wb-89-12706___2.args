toads, however, prefer their right, and pounce more quickly on morsels of food that enter their line of vision from their right.
the experts said: 'male and female cats differ in their behavioural patterns, for example hunting styles and parental care, and it is possible that these place different demands on motor functioning.'
dogs are the same - until they are spayed or neutered, when the difference disappears, suggesting hormones play a role in left or right-handedness.
humpback whales prefer to use the right side of their jaws to scape up sand eels from the ocean floor.
new scientist says: 'numerous studies have found that left-handers have an advantage in many sports involving a direct opponent, such as tennis or boxing, and the advantages may run to more serious encounters: many sports are forms of ritualised conduct, after all.'
