russian blue forum russian blue behavior or individual cat behavior?
11:05am pst hi, there -- i've had two blues -- my bridge baby, felix and my almost-year old, coopurr.
he will only let me pet him and cuddles with me, and has  finally recently started warming up to my husband.
but we're pretty certain he's arussian blue or at least part because he looks just like one.
he hasnt been around anyone else but us yet, so we will see if he gets shy and hides my posts | my page | msg me | gift me | become friends [notify] love cats?
a few people he'll sniff after while and be okay  with, but others he'll hiss at and hide from.
however, i have read that russian blues become attached to  one or two people and are really loyal.

he likes to have his belly rubbed and will "paw" us if we stop  petting him and he isnt done yet.
both of them are/were very attached to me.

this is a forum for bonding with your fellow catsters about the traits, quirks and idiosyncrasies of your favorite breed.
i guess my  "blue" doenst have a problem with new people.
he's very shy, he hides when anyone comes, he even hides from my husband sometimes.
felix would often hide when  people came over to the house, and most of the time, coopurr does the same.

coop and felix are also both alike in the sense that they both are/were  "one-parent cats" -- following me all over the house, showing me tons  of affection, and generally just trying to involve themselves in whatever i'm  doing.

i was always afraid that maybe he was abused as akitten, but i thought  i'd ask if it's normaly for most blues.

so i was wondering if most blues act like him.
our blue really doesn't like it when  people come into the house.
he is one of the most affectionet and vocal cats i have ever owned.
