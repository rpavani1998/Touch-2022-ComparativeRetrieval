when introducing a new cat to the family, keep him/her in a large crate until he/she is familiar and comfortable with the other cats and vice versa.
i often have many customers call who i like to refer to as "collectors" who think that they're doing a charitable cause by rescuing many cats and housing them.
- at 7:02 am, anonymous said... - i am also one of those people that have too many cats.
there are of course ways to make an ideal living situation for multiple cats: make sure that each cat has their own specific room or place to retreat from the other's.
owning more than one cat when one can barely afford one seems in my opinion both financially and emotionally irresponsible.
although, admirable financially, emotionally and socially, it is best to leave the care to the shelters rather than taking the responsibility on your own.
i know that all that will happen is they will end up putting that cat to sleep,so to me that is like signing their death warrent.
i did cover the financial cost in monday's blog stated that throughout the course of a cats lifetime it will cost $10,000 in vet bills and care.

if you want to do your part, most shelters welcome donations in the form of volunteer, money and or toys or foods.
wish that i had some place to take most of these cats.
the smell from accidental urination, you can kiss dinner parties and get togethers with human friends good-bye.
because our shelters are full and the government seems to think the stray animal population is not their problem, indivduals that are caring and good try to do it on their own.
i realize that most need to go to a place where they can be happy and run,however there is just no place around here.
cats prefer to be independent and have a hard enough time adjusting to another new cat in the household, let alone more than 1.
there is no shelter that will take cats now,and thank goodness that our apl is overcrouded and will not take them.
i to have a soft heart as well, however, hear so many customers on pensions trying to rescue cats when they can't even take care of themselves.

shelters are so over populated that they are turning people away...then what?!

most,since i cannot afford the vet bills have not even seen a vet,i don't want the cats to go to a shelter and then be put to sleep!
i really wish that there was a place i could take these cats where they could run.

in addition to the large vet bills, it will take more than an hour to clean up.
most places also won't take a cat unless it has had it shots.
anyway,i know that i have too many pets(21 cats in all indoors)and
having another cat makes up the difference in love whenever one cat(s) decides to indulge in his/her independence.

yes...it would be wonderful if you found a stray and took it to the shelter and it got adoopted but as many of us know, it does not always work that way.
my husband brought most of these cats home from work,i only had 1 ten years ago when i got married.
multiple cats can often lead to anxiety amongst the pack leading to other health issues that otherwise wouldn't present with a single or pair of cats.
it is possible that more than 1 cat can coexist; however, cats are more likely to have personality conflicts than dogs.

the rule of thumb according to some pet owners is that the affection and need of 1 dog is equivalent to 3 cats.

i can understand the need to have more than one cat as companionship.

i would be willing to be a million dollars that i do not have, that most people with 5 or more cats or dogs, did not intentionally go out and say..ummm...

cats are independent and very self sufficient.

i have a household with many cats and the one cat outdoors just had 5 kitties on memorial day eve.
if you have a heart, you cannot dump the poor animal on the street and if no shelter will take it...you end up with another cat.

think of a house full of cats as a reality show full of girls, there's a lot of drama amongst the pack.
