you sould become a writer if you already arent one.
also, interdependence and being social is a trait that most humans have so if you want to argue who acts more like humans, dogs would win.

how can somebody say a dog isn't that smart because it will only listen to commands and act based on reward, are they not doing exactly what humans do when they were trained/taught for society.
post one | permalink by gaia33 on august 18th, 2008 a cat can remember a maze 260 times longer than a dog...however, dogs do better on "social skills" than cats, although some cats (main coon,ragdoll, persians for example) are extremely sociable, and some dogs (many chows, for example), aren't.
they are way too intelligent to perform tricks to entertain us.
the cat being more cautious and curious does not make it smarter, thats a survival instinct.
they are also far too intelligent to think the world revolves around their person.
they actuall haave personality too.
the cat is they just dont show it.
maybe they don't want to be popular.
actually, i've seen a cat that acted like a dog before..that was so cute!
cats can be stuck out in the wild and survive.
wow, this is really funny.
i love all animals and have both a cat and a dog.
i think cats just don't care enough.
if i had to give an answer, it would be dogs because the only thing ive seen cats do is sit there and lick themselves, follow laser pointers and shiny things, climb up trees and not be able to get down (at least most of them) and get hit by cars after they escape from themselves and most likely cannot find their way back.
she came over, sniffed my hand, licked my hand, and 'stood up' like dogs do to get the person to pet them...it was so funny.
yeah, you will have some dogs that are smarter then cats and vise versa.
post one | permalink by glamorgirli on december 6th, 2006 my bird is smarter than both of them, but i'd have to say my cats are way smarter than my dogs.
i love dogs, they are such great companions.

post one | permalink by baileysmom12 coat of motherly love on february 7th, 2012 dogs have been described as little men in fur coats.
on the other hand a cat is nobody's fool.
they are more independent and less easily confused than most dogs i know.
but most dogs are just loyal, needy, cute little things.
one of my cats plays fetch - cats can be trained - they just need the right reward - dogs will do anything for any kind of reward.
post one | permalink by michalzor on july 21st, 2010 from all the research that can be done, it has been determined that cats and dogs are of equal intelligence levels.
also however, just because a cat is ignorant and too lazy to learn tricks does most definitely not mean he/she is smarter.

i've heard that the smartest dog is actually smarter than the smartest cat.
dogs watch spongebob and suck on lolipops.
i just know cats only obey you when they want to.
today i was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking.
they manage to get folks to go to great lengths to try and win their affection, while remaining aloof and sometimes downright contemptous of them.
they dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and i are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets.
just more easier to train.
by michalzor on july 21st, 2010 2 comments | post one | permalink by tinybubbles is sitting on the carpet read on december 9th, 2006 my cat is the smartest,because she is cute and very sneaky.
cleverer people than me have problems deciding how to measure and define it.
however, i could hear the noises and smell the food.
post one | permalink by kate_91491 on january 30th, 2007 the cat, in my opinion, is smarter in general.
i'll say a dog i've only seen cats sit around the house and lick themselves.
the cat i have now is smarter than any dogs i have owned.
also, scientific studies show that the cat brain structure is similar to a humans.
your death would grant a cat's fondest wish.
a human is trained through repetative teachings and rewarded for it in every aspect of life from the first time you went to the bathroom in the toilet or learned your muliplication tables to learning a new skill set at your job...reward, reward, reward!
i am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches.
just because you can't teach a dog to sit with a stupid hot dog over a week and it maybe takes two weeks to teach a cat, that doesn't mean cats are dumb.
they usually control the owners and become a dedicated part of the family.
just because a dog is much more trainable than a cat does not mean he/she is smarter.
the dog, i know many people will say cats because of how they act but the last i read, dogs were more popular, so if the cat was smart, they might act more like dogs.
both are smart in my opinion no comments.
overall they are the same "smartness".
by game masta on january 31st, 2007 1 comment | post one | permalink by jade on december 10th, 2006 the cat.
the cat,at least my cat.she is smarter then my dog.although you have to give my dog extra credit for being so
stray dogs, starving and getting ran over.
and both species have survived this long in the world so both have very good survival instincts.
i overheard that my confinement was due to the power of ‘allergies.’
he is regularly released - and seems to be more than willing to return.
they are quite well aware they are the centre of their universe.
the cat is obviously smarter.
dog.. i'd say the same by freshapples on december 6th, 2006 1 comment | post one | permalink by ggirl on february 10th, 2012 almost all dogs will eat cat crap from a litter box, but i've never heard of a cat eating dog crap.
i have had many cats and dogs but never one who is as smart as this cat.
i've seen many dead cats on the side of the road and i've also seen an entire street shut down because an intelligent cat climbed a tree and couldn't get down without the aid of a "trained" fireperson.
it's in the dogs breed to be taught tricks, that does not make them smarter.
by nice on march 4th, 2007 1 comment | post one | permalink by moley the contrary female dragon on february 7th, 2012 apparently cats have better problem solving ability.
they can learn so many tricks, and useful things as well.
overall, i think cats are a little bit smarter...i would say that perhaps "smarter" is not the word to describe them, but cunning!
on the other hand, it takes just about a dog's whole life to learn how to breathe!cats read harry potter and blow bubble pipes.
all of the dogs i know would be completely helpless without thier owners.
they dont have an owner.

i had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrates what i am capable of.
cats are more cautious and curious about their world.
however, they merely made condescending comments about what a ‘good little hunter’ i am.
just different style's - their spoiled no comments.
in my opinion and only mine, i do think dogs are smarter because they fit the criteria that i use when judging an animals mentality.
the dog receives special privileges.
in an attempt to disgust them, i once again vomit on the carpet.
cats are easier to clean up after.
a dog does what it is told or acts as if in a pack.
i think it's individual and that cats are just more independent than dogs are.
my captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects.
to me dogs are smarter,they are able to learn stuff cats can never do...if well trained you can rely on it,but you can never rely on cat..cats do the job to keep my dog kennels free of any rats or mouse...
cats have been described as little women in fur coats, therefore my answer is cats.
post one | permalink by disturbia on july 8th, 2008 oh cats def, i have that changes the tv channels on me, the lil shit lol no comments.
a cat can reason, choose for it's self.
i reall don't believe that one is smarter than the other.
although cats do bath themselves.
dogs are just more obiediant and loyal than cats.
today i decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet.
although i make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, i nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength.
my cats, on the other hand, trained me.
but i've known a lot of cats that were clowns too.
there are no tests at this moment in time that can clearly tell which animal is smarter.
i had a dog that could unlock and open doors.
ive seen way more dead cats on the side of the road than dogs.
for one reason,you can teach one to light a fuse in only 2 seconds.
kudos 2 u by cake007 on february 18th, 2009 gee thanks cake, but it's not my handiwork.
and in my opinion dogs are smarter.... props for counting out all those times by michalzor on july 21st, 2010 1 comment | post one | permalink by qeli on december 1st, 2007 my cat is by far smarter than any dog,she knows what you need or what she needs
but in general, i think cats are smarter.
