the domestic cat is adaptable and now lives with and interacts with his or her human companion.cat brains are smaller than dog brains because cats are solitary animals and dogs are social animals.the more active wildcat hybrids are known to be more intelligent than the passive, relatively uninquisitivepersians, for example.it is also worth making the point that there is a fairly wide spectrum of intelligence between the cat breeds.this is what makes it more intelligent and the wildcat hybrids are more intelligent than the wholly domestic cat breeds and moggies.one last interesting point, research indicates thatintelligent people prefer domestic cats to dogs.if, as stated, socialisation creates larger brains over millions of years, surely the lion must have the biggest brain of all the cats as it is the only cat that lives in groups except for feral cats who have adapted to this social way of life when there is a food source that feeds the group.surely with millions of years of socialisation between cat and human the cat will become more intelligent.it is said that cats have less sophisticated brains than dogs.i am not sure if the study measured intelligence in a complete way and went beyond brain size and problem solving abilities.we don't hear of dogsforetelling the death of a hospital patient and then comforting the patient, for example.they also say that members of the dog family are good at problem solving - better than cats.of course the dog should also become more intelligent but the dog takes commands unthinkingly.perhaps this attitude will develop into a more questioning approach from the cat and that too will speed up the development of the cat's brain.there is also the intriguing possibility that even if the research is accurate things will change over the next millions of years.
