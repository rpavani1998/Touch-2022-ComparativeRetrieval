this implies a structured and caring parental environment (caring for the young), reflexes that orient the young puppy to its parents, and the existence of optimal, even crucial, periods in the development of the animal's nervous system.in clinical practice we have observed cases where phobic behavior (both towards the dog's immediate surroundings and towards humans with which the dog has little contact) and anxiety develop in pre-puberty.these experiments enable us to deduce that when a gestating pet is given a friendly and caring human environment (with affectionate physical contact), the domestication and emotional balance of her offspring is facilitated, as compared with an environment where there is no contact and interaction with people.the media can also play a role in educating potential dog owners to adapt their relational needs to the dog's ecological and social reality, rather than their own personal wishes.lastly, stimulus-poor puppies run the risk of developing hyper-attachments to their biological or adoptive parents (transposition of hyper-attachment to its new human masters), which is a source of intolerance to isolation, attention-seeking behavior, reutilization of behavior acquired during illnesses, etc.this type of learning presents several characteristics: it is stable, rigid and persistent (sometimes for life); it is easily acquired; sexual imprinting occurs on supra-individual and supra-breed characteristics, which permits species generalization; filial imprinting (attachment) seems to be more discriminating and is limited to parents; fraternal imprinting is the basis of sociability; attachment is an interactive process.the interactive presence of other animals leads to interspecific socialization and attachment, and it counters predatory behavior.learning to control the intensity of its bite is actually part of a puppy's growing generalcontrol of its movements, enabling it to adopt postures and facial mimics which become the prevalent form of communication in animals having highly developed brains.a dog's epigenesis engenders multiple temperaments that can be partially foreseen by controlling its environmental stimuli.the relative absence of human contact leads to relative handicaps, such as fear/wariness/phobia towards a type of human (children, men,...).living in a group and adapting to varied environments calls for a certain degree of emotional equilibrium (with minor fluctuations).the dog's particular nature - a puppy has to learn to identify its own species - can serve to foster socialization with other species (called domestication when it involves interaction with humans).for caston, sensorial and social deprivation has impeached the maturation of the brain: it can not exert an inhibitory influence on the mesencephalic reticular formation (mrf) anymore; mrf is becoming hyperactive, and produces unfocalised and unadaptative behaviors.according to fuller (1961), puppies raised in isolation in a laboratory develop adequate socialization to humans if they receive two 20-minute periods of human contact per week.it is the breeder's role is to ensure temperamental selection and to enrich the development environment (under veterinary guidance).
