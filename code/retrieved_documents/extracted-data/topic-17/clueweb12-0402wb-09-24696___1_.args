alpha male jack russel terriers will kill just born puppies as they tend to view them as rats or other such things that they hunt and kill, not to eat just to kill.they’re more interested in welfare and drugs (cat chow and catnip) than in work (catching mice).on 19 aug 2011 at 1:39 pm # kalashnikat other way around, in my experience… i’d make the case that cats are democrats…expecting everything to be provided for them, including someone to clean up the litter pan after them…they don’t feel obligated to earn their keep by alerting to intruders or defending the home, they expect to be pampered and attended to by the hardworking homeowner.your opinions about my opinions are welcome in the comments and, as always, thanks so much for stopping by.cats are monarchists.once they get to be a few weeks old they are safe from the alpha male.cats are republicans, dogs are democrats an opinion piece from politico that’s actually amusing.am cats are republicans, dogs are democrats an opinion piece from politico that’s actually amusing.on 19 aug 2011 at 11:34 am # rich dustydog - i know that fish will eat their young its just food to them.democrats, on the other hand, are snakes, locusts.not that i don’t like dogs, just somebody elses dog.
