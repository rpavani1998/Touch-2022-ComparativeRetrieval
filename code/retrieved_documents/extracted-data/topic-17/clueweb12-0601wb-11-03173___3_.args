the only power any government has is the power to crack down on criminals.they are fun, independent, and know when you need some comforting.one, it's protects you from extremely aggressive cat behavior, and two, they calm down when they don't see anything.you just have to treat them like a toddler when they're scared, and you should do ok.we have 2 cats that we each had before we met and even though we have lived together for over 3 years now, the cats are still "mine and hers".next time your kitty gets spooked, make sure to talk to him/her in calm voice and already have your hand out, but out of reach, so you kitty knows you're trying to help.unfortunately, one of them didn't care too much for our kids, so we gave them back to the rescue organization, which quickly had them adopted out again.dogs that always jump on you annoy me, so dogs need to be trained real well.one declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes impossible to live without breaking laws.quotequote i voted cats because they are pretty much self sufficient and very low key for the most part.i like both cats and dogs but right now only have cats because our backyard is mostly pool and concrete and i am not home enough to properly care for a dog.i am not a big fan of cats because they like to climb up as high as they can get, their hair gets everywhere, and the litter box really stinks, regardless of when it was last changed.i love my cats and prefer them a touch over the dogs most because our dogs are nothing more then lap warmers.i like cats myself because of their independence.they can and will entertain themselves.
