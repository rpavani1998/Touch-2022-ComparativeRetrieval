all-in-all, the food was acceptable given the time we ate it at.there was an overwhelming onion taste to the sauce.not sure if we'd necessarily eat dinner here on a regular basis; but it's an option when one wants non-asian food early in the morning.although the pasta was not exactly al dente, it was far from being overcooked.it was crispy and slightly chewy while there was just enough toppings and cheese.it was quite crispy and not too oily; but the batter was quite thick.lots of noodles, sauce and cheese.part of his healthier diet, he ordered achicken salad.not particularly much in the way of meat, it was still a decent lasagna.noodles weren't too soft and surprisingly not that oily.no cucumber, no garlic, no taste, it was just yogurt.man, i personally haven't been to this place since my university days when dining at 2:30am was normal.for me, i call those places "desperate 24-hour food".averting disaster, i find out after the game we were indeed going out to eat.in fact, i enjoyed my pasta.
