so roxie, my friend lily, and i met up for dinner here last tuesday.
the italia was off the white side of the menu, meaning it had no sauce.
it was a good prosciutto-parmesan-arugula pizza, though the toppings didn’t blow me away.
the margherita was your classic, marinara sauce, mozzarella and basil.
i’m not always a huge fan of calimari, because i often find it too chewy.
i could have done with a little more basil, but i though the sauce was incredible… really bright tomato flavors.
the stand out on both pizzas, to me, was the crust.
looking around, the pizzas looked just slightly bigger than personal size– i could probably have finished a whole one with no appetizer, but i didn’t need one to myself.
the zucchini thrown in to the didn’t add a whole lot, but made me feel a tiny bit healthier.
i would highly recommend il canale for a nice meal out with your friends… it is budget-friendly, good for sharing, and has excellent food.
il canale get every new post delivered to your inbox.
this wasn’t chewy at all, however, and the batter was perfectly light and salty.
as expected on a tuesday, it wasn’t exactly packed, but i imagine it gets busier on weekends and i would probably make a reservation.
(potatoes, bread, pasta… yes, the spices love their carbs.)
so best for the area is good enough for me.

thankfully, we were soon proven wrong, and though the bread itself was pretty standard, the roasted garlic in the olive oil that came with it was awesome.

super chewy and really well flavored, it made me understand the cult of the neapolitan pizza.

$15 each for a filling meal… granted we didn’t get drinks or dessert, but it is undoubtedly very well priced (and certainly rivals the other italian eateries in georgetown in this respect).
the calimari came next, and totally blew me away.

we were a little worried at first that because “foccacia” was listed on the menu, we wouldn’t get free bread.
