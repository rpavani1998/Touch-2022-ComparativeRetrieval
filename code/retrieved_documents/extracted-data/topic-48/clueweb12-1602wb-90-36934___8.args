turn up the pan slightly and deglaze the pan with wine; leave to simmer for 5 minutes.
pick up the pastry carefully, using the rolling pin to transport it if necessary, and place in your flan tin (mine is 25cm and leaves me some pastry left over).
the last time i saw him was on saturday kitchen and i get way over excited at any sniff of celebrity so i practically forced him into a double-cheek kiss.
roll out to a round shape with a rolling pin to a thickness of around 0.5cm.
i have no idea why this is as i followed the (rachael ray) recipe to the letter, and even started the day by driving out to john lewis to purchase some brand-new digital scales.
the night was totally made by our waiter who used to work at shoreditch house and was the one who looked after us at our wedding reception in 2009.
i blame rachel ray again, along with the addition of a new hob with a hotter flame than i’m used to.

my fragile ego was rescued somewhat by the need to blind bake my pastry case.
it’s the least touristy place i’ve ever visited in greece; the onassis family own the next-door island and the summer season attracts wealthy greeks and italians rather than lager-lout brits.
gammon with peas and parsley sauce and rosemary roasted new potatoes.
admittedly it’s not the best recipe for weightloss, but i’m persevering with a lot of powerwalking when i go shopping.
the components are quite simply: pastry (shortcrust or puff, homemade or shop-bought), leftover roast meat (this week i used lamb), onions, 2 x veg, and gravy.
these lamb koftes are super easy to make, healthy and really delicious.

but i recently made the discovery that 0% fat greek yoghurt pretty much tastes the same as the fattening stuff.
i don’t like the preciseness of measurements of the ingredients or the fact you can’t really taste your cooking half way through.
the ambiance and social aspect of the place was welcoming and warm, i love the fact that the whole menu is available at the bar and you are welcome to drop in for not just a meal but drink, coffee (did i mention?
i have tried repeating it to myself over a dish of deep-fried calamari but it doesn’t work.
so in conclusion, i would and will definitely return.
pbj represents peanut butter and jelly; i recall the dish being different at maze as it was more sandwiched together than the separate ingredients on this plate, but it was delicious all the same.
cottage cheese with pineapple, cheddar biscuits, cherry tomatoes.
i never burn the onions so was obviously pretty distraught.
the english breakfast plate was interesting.
posh eating out is really important to us because it’s our couple time (apart from the frequent occasions elfie comes with us and
i love the modern tapas way of eating so we went with the small plates, and you can blame the sommelier for the fact i can’t recall how much they cost as she perfectly matched wines to each plate.

i haven’t  missed as many breakfasts as it looks here: a lot of the time i tend to grab a banana whilst elfie’s eating her toast or weetabix.
i used to lick my brother’s plate because it would make him totally freak out.
nobody’s internet connection is tough enough for all the photos that would necessitate.
start by combining all the pastry ingredients in a bowl; mix through with a knife, cutting and turning to make it cling together.
steak with homemade french fries, salad and roast tomatoes and onions) (l-r: lunch: (pub) starter – smoked salmon and prawn parcel (1970s style!), main – beer battered fish and chips.
our wine rack couldn’t hold three cases of wine, so we had to get a new one.
the in-laws lived on the beautiful island ofmeganissi for a long time and my father-in-law is buried there so we will continue to return for holidays as often as possible.
the highlight of the plates for me was the pork belly.
even elfie got involved (organix cheesy wheat puffs).

one of the best things about meganissi is the food.
the dough should be firm and pliable but not sticky.
you get the picture: we have a lot of wine right now.
jason atherton coming over to check on us at the end of the meal was a lovely touch.
i blame rachel ray again, along with the addition of a new hob with a hotter flame than i’m used to.
during pregnancy i put on three and a half stone.
whilst the dough is resting you can make the filling.
but these sorts of soulmate friends are bigger than supremely corked wine: they’re for life.
confusing to my poor boozed-up squinty eyes, it arrived looking like a plate of risotto.
fry off in oil on a medium heat and add your veg and herbs (if you’re using any frozen veg it should be added at the end).
tuna and sweetcorn quiche (thanks to delia for the great pastry recipe.
which is a shame, because i bloody love sandwiches, toast, pasta, cakes… i came up with some rules that i wanted to adhere to in order to become healthier, and hopefully slightly smaller-of-tum: - drink lots of water - don’t eat white bread, pizza or pasta (or refined carbs in general)
instructions start out by preparing your pastry and bringing it to room temperature.
lunch: cottage cheese with pineapple, cheddar biscuits, cherry tomatoes.
we get together with some very lovely friends of ours every month or so to eat, drink and laugh.

as i’m still trying to lose the last couple of pounds of baby weight i try not to indulge too much
after my pastry fiasco i didn’t trust that damned rachel ray and her quiche recipe.
place a layer of baking paper over the pastry, and add ceramic baking beans.
i’m not sure there is more of a decadent starter than steamed asparagus and homemade hollandaise (recipe will follow when i drag my face from the mixing bowl.
i have tried repeating it to myself over a dish of deep-fried calamari but it doesn’t work.
i’ve started keeping a weekly visual food diary which has really helped me stop and think about what i eat on a day-to-day basis.
lunch: avocado and tomato salad with balsamic syrup dressing.
crack the eggs into a large bowl, season, then add the milk and cream.
he must be smart because he hired my brother (who has a repultation for getting me hammered) to be in charge of the bar.
smoked salmon and avocado salad with greek yoghurt.
basically it was an amazing weekend but hangovers continue to increase in their brutality.
the drinking area is pretty lovely.
so now it’s going on everything; breakfast, posh prawn cocktail, pudding, and my personal favourite: tzatziki.
heat half a tbsp in a pan on a medium heat and cook the lamb sausages until browned all over, about 5 minutes on each side.
rupert and su were supposed to come and visit this friday but didn’t due to poor elfie getting rushed into hospital (more on that soon)
smoked salmon and avocado salad with greek yoghurt.
my mummy jelly belly is still well and truly in residence and i’ve come to the conclusion that i am slightly wheat intolerant; there ain’t nothing like my post-pizza bloat.
this reason for this week’s monday pie was simple: will let me have three lie-ins over the weekend.
in a smaller bowl mix together the remaining mint, cucumber, seasoning and yoghurt.
make up the wraps with the sausages, yoghurt mixture and sliced red onion.
cook at 180 degrees until golden brown on top – around 25 minutes.
cook for a further 25-30 minutes, or until the top of the quiche is golden brown.
i don’t like the preciseness of measurements of the ingredients or the fact you can’t really taste your cooking half way through.
it was bad – flaky and dry and no amount of trying to fix it with water worked.
it was a bit sloppy, a little weird, but good.
i chucked this lot and googled for a fail-proof delia recipe.
i knew i wanted tuna and sweetcorn (my aunt makes the most divine tuna and sweetcorn quiche), i threw in some dill i had in the fridge and used a mixture of egg and cream to get a richer finish than milk may have had.
there have also been occasions when i’ve tucked into my dinner, completely forgetting to take a picture, so all you get are my leftovers.
my mum used to make lovely victoria sponges for my brother and i (and she bought even better chocolate cakes from the deli in the next town); these cakes are an aspect of my childhood i will always remember really happily.
i love to cook and do it often, but baking… not so much.
the pastry now needs to rest in the fridge for a minimum of 30 minutes – something to do with gluten activation.
i guess just how it’s supposed to be because it tasted lovely.
will likes roast dinners in the winter, watching rugby on a sunday, bringing home the bacon and monday pies.
i like to use a fork or a knife to break up the meat, but then i get in there with my hands to smoosh it all together.
i have never blind baked anything in my whole life before, and it made me feel really quite special.
i was so busy fannying around with my failed pastry that i also burned the onions.
no comments happy birthday, will! saturday, may 21st, 2011 my husband’s birthday last weekend was everything a good birthday should be: friends, a full wine rack, food, babies, go karting and eurovision.

when the dough has rested for at least 30 minutes remove it from the fridge and place on a lightly dusted surface.
probably because i spent a whole £5 on my new ceramic baking beans.
there’s such a buzz about this place you’d probably end up eating in the toilet which would be no hardship as they’re a+!
we ended the evening with some insanely good coffee.
but there was more cheffy-deconstruction business going on here; the squid acted as the risotto paired with squid juice and cauliflower.
i have no idea why this is as i followed the (rachael ray) recipe to the letter, and even started the day by driving out to john lewis to purchase some brand-new digital scales.

i haven’t missed as many breakfasts as it looks here: a lot of the time i tend to grab a banana whilst elfie’s eating her toast or weetabix.
i always come home about 2 stone heavier with a renewed enthusiasm for feta, olives and greek yoghurt.
the gorgeous sea bass main course was cooked by the birthday boy as his wife was drunk and too absorbed in eurovision to spend 30 minutes in the kitchen.
if you wanted to make the quiche super rich you can substitute the milk for more cream.
i knew i wanted tuna and sweetcorn (my aunt makes the most divine tuna and sweetcorn quiche), i threw in some dill i had in the fridge and used a mixture of egg and cream to get a richer finish than milk may have had.
roast sweet potatoes, mushrooms and salad.
use your fingertips to judge if you will need to add any extra to the water.

i will note here that it’s a good thing my wine and pimms consumption has not been photographed.
my mood was saved by the next batch of pastry which turned out beautiful.
i guess just how it’s supposed to be because it tasted lovely.
start by frying off a finely chopped onion (until translucent, rather than black as above), which will take 8 to 10 minutes.

i chucked this lot and googled for a fail-proof delia recipe.
there’s a massive block of ice that is awesomely hand carved for the drinks (i’m easily pleased) and a gin-based menu of unusual cocktails, though they also take requests for all the classics.
heat half a tbsp in a pan on a medium heat and cook the lamb sausages until browned all over, about 5 minutes on each side.
this made it look not so delicious.
there is nothing like a massive load of cheese for breakfast to get over a hangover.
then there were spaces in the rack so we had to buy more wine.
you get the picture: we have a lot of wine right now.
i had something elderflower-based and refreshing in my chilled martini glass until it was time to go through to the dining room.
lamb, sweet potato, broad beans and peas, caramalized shallots.

i drink way too much to ever be a good restaurant critic.

the fois gras to me didn’t taste as gorgeously creamy as others i’ve tasted from borough market which was a let-down.
however, i was half cut by this point so it could well have been the booze coupled with my lacklustre knowledge on fois gras that was a fail here rather than the food.
the meat fell apart and i’m not ashamed to tell you my mouth is watering right now like nobody’s business.
i was so busy fannying around with my failed pastry that i also burned the onions.

i vowed never to wash my face again (i have) and he seemed like a genuinely nice guy.
this is a joke, i don’t have anything against vegetarians.
break up the tuna and sprinkle over the bottom of the case, and do the same with the onion and sweetcorn.
it was too much for me, the texture of it seemed odd for my provincial tastebuds.
this made it look not so delicious.
so i found myself with some left over vegetarian ingredients to cook with this week.
