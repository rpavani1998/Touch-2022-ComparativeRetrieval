while our attention to quality and dedication to service makes us good restaurants, our supporting of and giving back to communities in which we work makes us good neighbors.they have unbreakable standards and take pride in their products.yes, it’s labor intensive, and yes, our chefs arrive at our restaurants at ungodly hours to prepare the day’s ingredients; but we do it all for you.we purchase our ingredients from local vendors 9 months out of the year.we even offer an extensive gluten-free menu ranging from pizzas to pastas, beer, and molten chocolate cake.what we do know is that when it comes to creative, tasty, cutting edge dishes, folks in the know will still be coming to willow street.from the dough we use for our bread and pizzas, to our fresh mozzarella cheese, we do it all because we know that grandma’s way is best, so we do it the way she did.literally, almost everything…our pasta sauces, salad dressings, soups (including stocks), fresh mozzarella cheese, pizza dough, honey wheat bread, and desserts.which is why we do our best to give back to the cities and towns in which we work and many of our employees live.thanks to the folks at facebook and twitter, we can actually keep in touch with our customers 24/7.all homemade and all prepared in-house.well actually, if the truth be known, pizza may have started us on our journey but it’s what else we do that has kept us at the front of the pack for a generation.which brings me to my point; the saying goes “home is where the heart is”, and to produce truly amazing food, you must to cook with heart.i have the absolute pleasure of working for a company in willow street pizza that takes as much pride in homemade goodness as i do.there is a reason that you pay the money you do at fine-dining restaurants.
