here is what i did…quickly baked some garlic breads (click here for recipe,garlic bread), made pizzas n pasta with shrimps, tossed the boiled potato in yogurt, mayo, salt, pepper & sugar for a yummy creamy potato salad….

i am looking for some great food and wine blog writers.
add the drained pasta along with cooked prawns and toss into the masala and cook for 5 minutes.
note: you can use any topping that you like for the pizzas.
i work for a swedish social media company which has clients in india as well.
our members attend food and wine tasting events for free and blog about them and their blogs are linked to our european and indian websites.
layer the cooked pasta with sauce with grated cheese and bake for around 10 mts till the cheese is completely melted.

drain and then sieve through cold water (this retains the colour of the pasta, in case you are using multi-coloured pasta).
slice the mushrooms thin with the stalks and place them in a pan with 1 tbsp of water over high heat.
in a pan, heat olive oil, and saute the onions & capsicum, then add the chopped tomatoes and the chilli-garlic-sauce-paste.
arrange the capsicums on top and spread the mushrooms n other veggies n prawns over the capsicums.

remove the pizzas from the oven as soon as the cheese starts melting and the base turns light brown.
