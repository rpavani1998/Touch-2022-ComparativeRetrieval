with high mortality rates and lower cases of heart diseases among asians (particularly the japanese), it’s no secret that the traditional asian diet has numerous benefits both physically—helps maintain a healthy weight—and internally, as your body lower levels of unhealthy toxins.its health benefits have long been lauded, as it’s known to help prevent heart diseases, intestinal disorders and cancers as it contains antioxidants.soymilk is a healthier option, as it has the same amount of protein as cow’s milk, but with smaller amounts of saturated fat and no cholesterol.by comparing the eating habits in the u.s and east asia (mainly china, taiwan, korea and japan), we can understand why and how the typical asian diet can translate into a healthier lifestyle.much of what accounts for why asians are generally more slender and healthier than americans — who are currently dealing with widespread obesity — lies in the differences in diet.overall, asians mostly consume foods that are lower in carbohydrates and cholesterol.besides food products, a major contribution to the healthy diet of asians comes from their frequent consumption of tea, particularly green, oolong or black.according to oldways, rice provides 25 to 80 percent of the calories in the daily diet of 2.7 billion asians.since many asians tend to be lactose-intolerant, they often drink soymilk rather than whole milk.on the other hand, the main ingredient for americans is white bread, which in large amounts causes carb-overload, and unnecessary weight gain.another major ingredient in the asian diet is soy, frequently consumed in the form of tofu, which contains large amounts of iron, calcium and protein, while being low in carbohydrates and fats.in the u.s., on the other hand, coffee, whose health benefits are often questionable, remains the preferred source of caffeine.though it’s easy to eat as americans do, given we live in the states, you can try adhering to the eating habits of your parents and grandparents, since it seems to be working out quite well for a few billion people halfway across the world.it can mess up your hormones and your digestive system.eating style while americans usually eat from separate dishes, asians are accustomed to family-style dishes, where there is typically one small dish of each food group for everyone to share, paired with a bowl of rice and sometimes a bowl of soup.
