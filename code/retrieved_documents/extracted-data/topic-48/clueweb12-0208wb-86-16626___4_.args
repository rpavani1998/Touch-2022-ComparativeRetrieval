the new rules force all food sold in a school — including fundraising bake sales — to have high levels of essential nutrients and to be low in fat, sugar and sodium.at applewood heights, a test school for the peel district school board, healthier foods have been on the new menu for about a year.since schools are allowed only 10 days each year to bend the food rules, many groups were vying for an exemption to hold fundraisers such as bake sales or barbecues where they’d offer higher-fat fare, she added.while students may have been longing for some of the treats once available in the caf, they gave the thumbs-up to the new, healthy offerings now mandated by the province.but the changes are positive, she added, because “kids start to realize what is a treat, and what they can eat every day.”“you know it’s nutritious because it’s gone through the different tests, and because of the serving sizes,” said chan, who ordered the $5 pasta combo with a side salad and chocolate milk.teacher angela currie said cafeteria staff listened to student input when it came to changing the menu.as for school fundraisers, students had to think of ways to raise money without bake sales — when raising money for japan after the tsunami, for example, they sold paper cranes instead of baked goods.just one is left, and it sells water and juice.“it’s good for you, and it makes it easy that it’s available right in the school.he ate the same meal on tuesday and said it tasted great.she also likes the new pizza, with a non-oily, thinner crust and lots of veggies.one grade 11 student, sitting outside and sharing a big, $5 plate of sesame chicken from the chinese fast-food place with a friend, said she misses the school’s vending machines.“the fries tasted really good — a big improvement,” added grade 12 student daniel lee, who also raved about the chicken burger.“the only healthy food we could get before was at valu-mart,” the grocery store down the street, said nilani ananthamoorthy, 17.
