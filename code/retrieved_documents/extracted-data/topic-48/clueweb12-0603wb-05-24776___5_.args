in addition to lower disease risks and increased longevity, the mediterranean way of eating is tasty, enjoyable, flavorful, and results in an overall sense of well being and satisfaction.several epidemiological studies have investigated these dietary components in various forms and further support the positive health effects of the mediterranean diet.compared to the control diet with cardiac patients, the "mediterranean diet" has proven to lower cardiac and all-causes mortality.intervention studies in east finland and southern italy have convincingly shown that the coronary risk profile (lower ldl cholesterol and blood pressure levels) is improved by a mediterranean diet.the extensive use of olive oil is common in both diets, and as a monounsaturated fat is healthier than saturated fats--studies claim it helps lower cholesterol levels.overall, italian-american cooking lacks the essentials of a good, traditional mediterranean diet.the mediterranean diet is low in saturated fat and high in monounsaturated fatty acids, high in antioxidants (especially vitamin c and e), and high in fiber and folic acid.after studying countries of the mediterranean diet, a decrease has been seen in coronary heart disease, cancer and other food-rel.the italians consume large portions of fruits and vegetables, which is unlike the italian-style cooking habits in the united states where the most 'popular' italian food is pizza.in the middle east, unlike italy, pasta is not as common, so chick peas and other grains replace the pasta in their diet.in reality, only high-end italian restaurants in the united states offer a good variety of vegetables more similar to that of an authentic italian diet.you can see from the data that the english do not consume a large majority of fruits and vegetables, and cooking vegetables in the traditional "english style" results in even less nutrient consumption.mediterranean diets are characterized by olive oil, as the dominant fat source and a high to moderate consumption of fruit and vegetables, grains, fi sh, and legumes, in combination with a little meat and wine with meals.salads and pre-prepared dressings are unknown creations to italians and don't compare to the taste of fresh olive oil and a quality balsamic vinegar.however, the dietary principles are similar: it is a balance of simple and complex carbohydrates, proteins, and non-saturated (and some saturated) fats.
