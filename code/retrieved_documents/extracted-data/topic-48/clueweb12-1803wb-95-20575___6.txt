as i was packing up my gear for friday night hockey, i glanced over at my camera bag.
averting disaster, i find out after  the game we were indeed going out to eat.
it wasone dark, rainy vancouver night (isn't  it always???)
anyways, he asked for it to be medium-rare and it  came out past medium.
all-in-all,  the food was acceptable given the time we ate it at.
lionel hutz ended up with the lasagna and yes, it was quite  the meal.

not sure if we'd necessarily eat dinner here on a  regular basis; but it's an option when one wants non-asian food early in the  morning.
ever since polka king met polka dot, they have been  inseparable, which means he has not been eating out with us.
miraculously, the car did not hit  anything (other cars, people, curb, pole).
at least the chicken was plentiful and moist.
trying to be healthier (ha!), we went for the whole  wheat crust.

when i was driving along broadway with viv, costanza and elaine  in my ol' gti when i got cut off suddenly.
it wasn't exactly super tender; but it wasn't tough  either.
man, i personally haven't been to this place since my university days when dining at 2:30am was normal.
whatever, we all decided to celebrate it.
he managed to finish it all... and the baked potato too.
- parker pages - peter's food adventure - pho411
so we didn't have incredibly high expectations.
lots of noodles, sauce and cheese.
so i sacrificed and had thespaghetti bolognese.
turned out to be a  good choice since it was freakin' large.
it was quite crispy and not too oily; but the batter was quite thick.
in  fact, i enjoyed my pasta.
it wasone dark, rainy vancouver night (isn't it always???)
so once again, reaching deep  within my subconsciousness, i suggested gigi's out on broadway.
well, viv wasn't with me tonight, so i joyously recounted the story  to everyone instead...
well... itwas his birthday as we started the game.
swerving to the other lane, i lost control and did 2 complete 360's in the middle of broadway and ended up parking backwards in between 2 cars in front of mec.
knowing thatpolka king was going to pay for his dinner, milhouse milked  it for all it was worth by going for the10 oz.
although the pasta was not exactly al dente, it was  far from being overcooked.
once showered and changed, it would be nearing 1:30am...
in fact, it was a scene of a vehicular "incident" that viv will never let me forget.
so much so, that was all i could taste.
the crust was neither thin nor thick, somewhere in between.
all-in-all, the food was acceptable given the time we ate it at.
turns out it was milhouse's birthday.

it was crispy and slightly chewy while there was just enough toppings and cheese.
most places are only open until 2:00am.
on top of this, i shared a hawaiian pizza with gordo.
you can imagine viv's response!
the good: - open really late - lots of choice - food is generally alright the bad: - food is generally alright - some items are actually pricey 0 comments: post a comment newer post older post home search this site by: ifood.tv blog archive - ► 2012 (96) - ► april (20) - hi-nippon - kwan kee noodle house - cindy's palace - gino's - sawasdee thai - red card sports bar + eatery - king's chinese cuisine - dim sum @ gingeri - thai away home - anatolia's gate - chutney villa - pho linh - oscar's pub - jade dynasty - brioche - the charlatan - full house - manzo japanese restaurant (itamae) - nu greek (gastown) - onyx steakhouse & lounge (white rock) - ► march (22) - green bamboo - between two buns - good choice - cartems donuterie - hub restaurant & lounge - sunday brunch @ ebo (delta hotel burnaby) - golden ray bakery - golden harvest - thu hien

the crust was neither thin nor  thick, somewhere in between.
since we finished after  midnight, it was technically not his birthday anymore.
knowing thatpolka king was going to pay for his dinner, milhouse milked it for all it was worth by going for the10 oz.
so, i didn't get the evil eye...
part of his healthier diet, he ordered achicken salad.
anyways, he asked for it to be medium-rare and it came out past medium.
so i stopped and ran in  to get it.
since we finished after midnight, it was technically not his birthday anymore.
ultimately, it didn't detract from the final  product though.
first thing that came out of my mouth was, "at least the car is okay".
once showered  and changed, it would be nearing 1:30am...
for me, i call those places "desperate 24-hour food".

what a great decision that was.
for me, i call  those places "desperate 24-hour food".
can't go to a place that specializes in pizza and pasta and not try it!
no cucumber, no garlic, no taste, it was just yogurt.
it was crispy and slightly chewy while there was  just enough toppings and cheese.
you can imagine viv's  response!
now as for the  food, ginseng and sweet tooth decided to share thecalamari.
in fact, i enjoyed my pasta.
as for the tzatziki, it was well... not tzatziki.
so it was a total  shock he joined us tonight.

milhouse balked at knight & day, denny's and tops.
this was pretty much a solid pizza.
can't go to a  place that specializes in pizza and pasta and not try it!
miraculously, the car did not hit anything (other cars, people, curb, pole).
after all, the game starts at 11:30pm and doesn't end until 12:45am!
man, i  personally haven't been to this place since my university days when dining at  2:30am was normal.

it was a chicken salad...
when i was driving along broadway with viv, costanza and elaine in my ol' gti when i got cut off suddenly.
what's the harm in bringing the camera anyways?
not particularly much in the way of meat, it was still a decent lasagna.
only 24 hour joints came to mind.
so it was a total shock he joined us tonight.
it just wasn't balanced.
"should i bring it or leave it at home?"
ever since polka king met polka dot, they have been inseparable, which means he has not been eating out with us.
so, i threw my hockey bag into the suv and started to leave.
there was an overwhelming onion taste to the sauce.
noodles weren't too soft and  surprisingly not that oily.
