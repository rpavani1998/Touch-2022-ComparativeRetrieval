he does what i hope to do, make good cooking accessible to everybody, no matter who you are or how old you are.just because you find yourelf disabled or weaker due to aging doesn't mean that you have to resort to take-out or frozen dinners.share the dishes you love to cook the most and the recipes that go with them.most everybody knows how to make a taco i think, especially those who live in southern ca, where we have a mix of all ethnic races and tacos are becoming almost more popular than a burger...sometimes, sharing the wisdom you have learned in a business is better than sharing what worked.you can make taco salads or tostada salads with the leftover meat, or if you have a family of 4, this will do just fine.this site has more than just recipes but also decorating tips, inspirational stories, travel tips, and just plain "news you can use".you can also fill them with cooked seasoned chicken or fish, if you can find a good price on it.)you can also make these as they do in mexico, with wrap the meat mixture in a corn tortilla that you can either warm or serve as is-for a soft taco.substitute ground turkey for beef where possible and you will be eating healthier, saving a few bucks, and if you season the turkey, you won't even know-and your family won't know you made made a healthier substitution!if you are interested in an affiliate program, or having me help you advertise your food product or appliance, contact me at the above number or at carestaurantshowcase@gmail.com.add your choice of vegetables from onion, peppers, cooked potatoes and then add other seasonings to your liking of garlic, cumin, and even a cup of mild salsa would be awesome in this!a helpful note: check out latin american markets in your area or at least a well-stocked market like jonâ€™s marketplace, if you are lucky enough to live by one, or another family owned market.after all, all the photos i have ever seen of cows in the rural areas of america's heartland are cows grazing on grass-what they were made to do, not grazing in a pile of grain-that took farmer's time and money to grow.this is an outstanding seasoning and i use it on chicken breast or chicken thighs to make chicken tacos.
