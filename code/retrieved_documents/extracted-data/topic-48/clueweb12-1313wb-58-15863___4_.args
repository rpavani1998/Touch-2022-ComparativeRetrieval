the aim is to identify items on the menu which already meet the dietary guidelines recommended by the hsfsa and to offer suggestions on making small changes to menu items to make them more heart-friendly.look for the heart mark the heart and stroke foundation (hsfsa) has joined forces with some restaurants to include healthier meal options that are lower in fat, cholesterol and salt, and higher in fibre.get nutrition smart some fast-food outlets have started making the nutritional details of their meals available both on the internet as well as inside their stores.if you’re having steak, choose the smallest option (often, especially irritatingly for men who're not huge eaters, called a 'ladies' steak), grilled, and with visible fat removed.a 100g portion of roasted chicken with skin has 933kj and 13.5g of fat while 100g skinless chicken supplies only 640kj and 4.2g fat – quite a difference.eating out diabetic diet allergy & intolerance food allergy food intolerance healthy foods fruits a-z veggies a-z nuts seeds grains food-related disease microbiological poisoning chemical/metal poisoning vitamins & minerals water centre water1805 21 24 36 *please note that some of the fast-food outlets have done their nutritional analyses per 100g (indicated next to relevant menu items in the table), whereas others have worked with the total mass of the menu item.however, be careful of high-kilojoule salad dressings, yellow cheese and sour cream.(g) double crunch (per portion) 3000 29 69 43 grilled burger (per portion) 1535 5 51 30 twister (per portion) 2515 28 55 31 grilled twister (per portion) 1590 9 45 28 crispy strips with dip (per portion) 2055 25 29 37 crispy strips with no dip (per portion) 1805  21 24 36 *please note that some of the fast-food outlets have done their nutritional analyses per 100g (indicated next to relevant menu items in the table), whereas others have worked with the total mass of the menu item.skip the chips more fast-food outlets are adding salad to their menus.it's not true that healthy eating needs to be an all-or-nothing thing; homecooked meat-and-three-veg or a sugary greaseball.you could also have a coffee, tea or cappuccino with skimmed milk.also avoid creamed, sugared and buttered vegetables (ask for grilled or steamed options instead).if you’re having chicken, take the skin off, or order it skinless (this option is available at nando’s).planning a baby pregnancy babies and kids teens adult woman adult man ageing food as medicine the immune system how it works
