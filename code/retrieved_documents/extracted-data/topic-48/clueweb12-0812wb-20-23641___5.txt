auntybunny posted:3/22/2008  i loved this recipe....made half with pepperoni, half with  mushrooms for my husband.
used a mixture of bread crumbs and butter with the milk to bind the pasta  together, and tripled the recipe.

kayajane posted:12/24/2006  you could either use  pizza sauce or spaghetti sauce.
i didn't have enough tomato sauce, so i added a drained can of  petite diced tomatoes.
i used spaghetti sause and omitted the tomato sause and good  seasonings.
drain spaghetti; return to pan.
my family enjoyed it as well.

i put pepperoni on top of all of it to make it seem more like  "pizza" instead of a circle of baked spaghetti.
we fed 208 students at lunch time.
i added some broccoli before i sprinkled the  cheese - and i added more cheese!
cook spaghetti in large saucepan as directed on package.
next time i make it i will cut the seasoning packet  to half....it was a little too spicy/salty for my liking.
used the four cheese  italian shredded!
extra-lean ground beef 1 egg, beaten 1/4 cup fat-free milk 1 can (14 oz.)
i actually substituted the beef  for a pound of diced chicken breast.
i added green peppers and  mushrooms on top.
