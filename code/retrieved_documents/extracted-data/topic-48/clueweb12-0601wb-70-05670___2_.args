sometimes life gets so hectic with studying and socializing that you find that you have no time to prepare food yourself and so end up eating out or grabbing food on the run a lot.a lot of fat in sandwiches can come from butter, margarine, mayonnaise, or oil based dressing.frying any food in batter or breadcrumbs means it will absorb fat.thick crust pizza's are healthier than thin crust pizza's.skinless chicken is also a healthier choice than coated, deep fried chicken.the thicker the chip, the less fat it absorbs during the cooking.• fish is a healthy option, and with potatoes make a filling nutritious meal.for a healthier option tomato based sauces made with vegetables, fish or lean meat are the ones to go for, instead of the butter, cream and cheese based sauces.it is therefore advisable to grill or oven cook chicken.any coated and deep fried foods will be relatively high in fat.• potatoes are an excellent source of starch, and if eaten with the skins are a good source of fibre.the amount of fat your burger contains partly depends on how it's cooked.grilled burgers can actually be quite lean, but burgers fried will contain a lot more fat.they're more filling, so you'll eat proportionally more base and less topping.• don't forget there are plenty of sandwich fillings which are healthier choices e.g., lean meats like ham, beef, pork, turkey, chicken tikka, tuna without mayonnaise, sardines, sliced egg, cottage cheese and edam.
