as i was packing up my gear for friday night hockey, i glanced over at my camera bag.
averting disaster, i find out after the game we were indeed going out to eat.
anyways, he asked for it to be medium-rare and it came out past medium.
all-in-all, the food was acceptable given the time we ate it at.
lionel hutz ended up with the lasagna and yes, it was quite the meal.
not sure if we'd necessarily eat dinner here on a regular basis; but it's an option when one wants non-asian food early in the morning.
ever since polka king met polka dot, they have been inseparable, which means he has not been eating out with us.
miraculously, the car did not hit anything (other cars, people, curb, pole).
at least the chicken was plentiful and moist.
trying to be healthier (ha!), we went for the whole wheat crust.

when i was driving along broadway with viv, costanza and elaine in my ol' gti when i got cut off suddenly.
it wasn't exactly super tender; but it wasn't tough either.
man, i personally haven't been to this place since my university days when dining at 2:30am was normal.
he managed to finish it all... and the baked potato too.
so we didn't have incredibly high expectations.
lots of noodles, sauce and cheese.
so i sacrificed and had thespaghetti bolognese.
turned out to be a good choice since it was freakin' large.
it was quite crispy and not too oily; but the batter was quite thick.
in fact, i enjoyed my pasta.
so once again, reaching deep within my subconsciousness, i suggested gigi's out on broadway.
swerving to the other lane, i lost control and did 2 complete 360's in the middle of broadway and ended up parking backwards in between 2 cars in front of mec.
knowing thatpolka king was going to pay for his dinner, milhouse milked it for all it was worth by going for the10 oz.
although the pasta was not exactly al dente, it was far from being overcooked.
once showered and changed, it would be nearing 1:30am...
in fact, it was a scene of a vehicular "incident" that viv will never let me forget.
so much so, that was all i could taste.
all-in-all, the food was acceptable given the time we ate it at.
it was crispy and slightly chewy while there was just enough toppings and cheese.
most places are only open until 2:00am.
on top of this, i shared a hawaiian pizza with gordo.
better than most while not particularly exciting.
now, it wasn't a bad onion flavour.
since we finished after midnight, it was technically not his birthday anymore.

part of his healthier diet, he ordered achicken salad.

ultimately, it didn't detract from the final product though.
first thing that came out of my mouth was, "at least the car is okay".
once showered and changed, it would be nearing 1:30am...
for me, i call those places "desperate 24-hour food".

no cucumber, no garlic, no taste, it was just yogurt.

now as for the food, ginseng and sweet tooth decided to share thecalamari.
in fact, i enjoyed my pasta.
as for the tzatziki, it was well... not tzatziki.
so it was a total shock he joined us tonight.

milhouse balked at knight & day, denny's and tops.
this was pretty much a solid pizza.
miraculously, the car did not hit anything (other cars, people, curb, pole).
after all, the game starts at 11:30pm and doesn't end until 12:45am!
