the problem with agave is that it’s basically a glorified hfcs from a metabolic perspective, if not even worse.

maybe they’re not having the same weight loss problems that others are, but they are still going to incur negative effects of putting those chemicals into their system.
i would not eat packaged foods sweetened with stevia personally on any regular basis, though here or there they are probably okay.
you’ll love the challenge and you’ll feel great after.
as with all toxins that enter our system, they are stored in our fat cells.
what are your thoughts on coconut crystals and nectar?reply diane, i am interested in what you have to say about this too.reply they’re natural sweeteners, not chemicals, but still sugar.
check out my simple, real-food based program: the 21-day sugar detox .
it’s just $21 for the manual, supplement guide and faqs/what to expect guide (e-books/pdf downloads) and it’s filled with lots of paleo-friendly recipes.
http://amzn.to/ryueyr the liquid extract is okay, but i would just watch out for over-use/reliance on it for sweetness regularly.
i would also love more insight on agave.
granted, there are some people out there who are not overweight and who consume non-caloric/chemical sweeteners.
examples: kashi golean crunch cereal: 1 cup serving size, 37g carbs, 13g sugar (more than 1 tbsp!)
sweeteners that come from nature are always better to consume than those that come from a lab or factory.
it’s probably made from the alcohol version of the stevia which is how they make the extract, but i personally wouldn’t use it with any regularity.
non-chemical sweeteners are not necessarily “healthy,” it simply means that they’re refined from something that was found in nature and are not made from chemicals.
here’s how it goes… eat something sweet (regardless of calories) > insulin is released > body stores nutrients.
when our bodies process fructose, our liver needs to begin the metabolic process before the sugars are broken down into their usable form of glucose in the body.
regardless of the source, it’s always best to minimize your exposure to sweeteners.
for more on the subject, i would recommend checking out dorway.com and mercola.com and searching through some articles.
granted, there are some people out there who are not overweight and who consume non-caloric/chemical sweeteners.
when our bodies release insulin, we are in a storage-mode since insulin’s job is to put nutrients into your cells.
studies have shown that any sweet sensation can cause an insulin release in your body.
sweeteners that come from nature are always better to consume than those that come from a lab or factory.
a raw honey will be much more of a while/unrefined food and while relatively high in fructose as a percentage of it’s makeup, it’s much lower in fructose when compared to the refined sweeteners.
typically, non-chemical sweeteners can be metabolized by our bodies while chemical sweeteners cannot and are considered toxins within our system.
i was tempted to try it but thought i would so a little more research before i wasted the money.
non-chemical sweeteners include: we can also classify things like high fructose corn syrup (hfcs), agave and brown rice syrup as non-chemical sweeteners though that sort of makes me cringe to say it.
when our bodies release insulin, we are in a storage-mode since insulin’s job is to put nutrients into your cells.
the ingredients list inulin fiber and stevia extract as the only two ingredients and the box says it’s chemical free.
the ingredients are water and stevia.
maybe they’re not having the same weight loss problems that others are, but they are still going to incur negative effects of putting those chemicals into their system.
even if you don’t want to do the full detox, the recipes, tips & tricks are fantastic (if i do say so myself).
i have seen this pop up in a few recipes and just recently spotted it at the market.
so besides having the above-listed negative side-effects, the ramifications from the consumption of artificial sweeteners can be very far-reaching.

i wouldn’t advocate using any sweeteners with abandon, but most of the natural ones are fine here or there – not daily.
if we’re going to eat something sweet, calories should follow.
i would really appreciate your say on this because i consume that stevia.

thanks!reply read my post on truvia here: http://balancedbites.com/2011/01/there-is-nothing-honest-about-truvia.html i don’t recommend any stevia that’s white– the green powder or extract here or there is probably okay.reply your email address will not be published.
it may also contain additives and ingredients you don’t want to consume.reply thank you for this and for the links.
sweeteners: evaporated cane juice crystals listed 3rd after the grains and the added soy protein concentrate (which are both topics for another day), then brown rice syrup listed 4th and honey listed 8th.
i just don’t think they make much sense.
studies have shown that any sweet sensation can cause an insulin release in your body.
my guess is that the sweet taste will affect it.
i just avoid “foods” like that as a general rule anyway.reply i have a brand of stevia called sweetleaf.
thanks!reply it has a very high fructose content, leaving it very similar to hfcs in composition.

the bottom line: anything that comes from nature will always be better for you than something that was made in a lab or a factory.
yoplait strawberry yogurt: 1 container serving – 6oz sweeteners: sugar listed 2nd, high fructose corn syrup listed 4th.
fructose metabolism happens in the liver first, which is not ideal for us… taxing our livers with excess fructose isn’t something we want to do.
our livers are hard at work just trying to detox our system, so putting more pressure on them with refined sweeteners isn’t something we want to do.
i am thinking your 21-day sugar detox could be for me.
book a seminar or get details.
i have metabolic syndrome and started low carb in april, lost 10 lbs and no more but was using artificial sweeteners.
our livers need to work on so many metabolic and detoxification processes that lessening the blow in any way we can is a good plan.
all sweeteners, caloric or non-caloric, can contribute to weight-gain or prohibit weight loss.
agave is comprised in the greatest percentage of fructose (possibly higher in fructose than high fructose corn syrup depending on the brand/type/etc.).
all sweeteners, caloric or non-caloric, can contribute to weight-gain or prohibit weight loss.
i have also heard about some issues with ibs/ibd triggering from sugar alcohols.
the point was that you were avoiding consuming calories and maybe even trying to lose some body fat.
thank you so much, sophie …reply a girlfriend of mind likes using the sweat leaf stevia packets in moderation for a sweetener.
