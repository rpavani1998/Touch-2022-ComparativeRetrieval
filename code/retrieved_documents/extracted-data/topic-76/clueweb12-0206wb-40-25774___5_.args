in addition to antioxidants, honey also has some antibacterial properties.also, agave syrup is low on the glycemic index, meaning it doesn’t raise blood sugar quickly.raw sugar raw sugar comes from sugar cane, just like white sugar, but it’s less refined, so it’s coarser in texture and has a golden color (from the molasses it retains).besides its typical use on pancakes, waffles or french toast, maple syrup also works as a glaze on root vegetables, like sweet potatoes, acorn or butternut squash, turnips and carrots.“added sugar, no matter where it comes from, is added sugar -- and in excessive amounts, it could increase body fat,” says registered dietitian lona sandon, an assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the university of texas southwestern medical center.because it lends foods a rich, dark flavor as well as a touch of sweetness, it’s a good choice for baking spice cakes, gingerbread or ginger snaps.when researchers at virginia tech compared the antioxidant content of various sweeteners, they found considerable variability: most antioxidants: dark and blackstrap molasses some antioxidants: maple syrup, brown sugar, honey minimal antioxidants: refined sugar, corn syrup, agave nectar here’s a guide to how sweeteners otherwise stack up, along with directions for best using each one: agave syrup agave syrup is a natural sweetener made from the sap of the agave plant.it contains more antioxidants than all other natural sweeteners, and it also contains a small amount of iron, says sandon.well agave syrup, stevia, honey and other natural sweeteners are all the rage these days, as more people worry that white sugar and high-fructose corn syrup are making them gain weight and increasing their risk for type 2 diabetes.brown sugar made from molasses and white sugar, light brown sugar is best for baking (cakes, cookies, pies and sweet breads) or sprinkling on oatmeal.it also “gives a better texture to baked goods because of how it absorbs water and adds volume to whatever you’re preparing.”it contains the same calories as white sugar, but it’s considerably sweeter -- so you don’t need to use as much.stevia this sweetener is derived from the leaves of the stevia plant and contains almost no calories -- yet it can be used cup-for-cup as a replacement for sugar, says ginn.the dark brown variety, in contrast, gives foods (like baked beans, stews and gingerbread) a richer flavor, thanks to the extra molasses it contains, says ginn.but “because it has a higher percentage of fructose than what’s in high-fructose corn syrup, it may raise triglyceride levels in your blood, according to studies done at ut southwestern,” warns sandon.
