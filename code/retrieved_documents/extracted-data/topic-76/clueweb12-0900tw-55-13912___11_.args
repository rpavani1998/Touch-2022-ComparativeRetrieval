diabetes, heart disease, cancer, obesity and all the other diseases of lifestyle have multiple contributers including excess calorie and carbohydrate consumption, lack of exercise, low fruit and vegetable intake etc.more than any other kind of sugar, fructose raises triglycerides—a serious risk factor forheart disease.once we get a large amount of the added sugars out of our diets we will be a lot closer to having the good health we all desire.studies have shown that fructose produces insulin resistance in animals.rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain, and extra abdominal fat.while honey is a natural food, it is still a source of sugar, as it does affect your glucose and insulin levels.whether this makes a difference or not during digestion and absorption is still under debate, however some evidence indicates that fructose in the free form (hfcs) may bring about the harmful changes described in the article faster and/or more efficiently than chemically bonded fructose.more and more research is showing that it is actually an early warning sign of excess blood sugar, not too little and that it is a withdrawal symptom.largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as “diabetic friendly.”thanks for your good work, rosemarie stinnett honey is probably the best sweetener, made up of only monosaccaride (single celled and requires no digestion) sugars, but still is sugar.and will have negative effects on blood sugar and diabetes syndromes.etc. hfcs is a contributor to poor health, especially when ingested in large quantities, but it doesn’t “cause” anything all by itself…it takes several contributing factors together to cause those diseases.“fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses.while raw organic honey does have a few health benefits, it does affect blood sugar, same as agave.we agree that whole foods and less sugars is the key to health.in the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits (it’s considered a fiber).
