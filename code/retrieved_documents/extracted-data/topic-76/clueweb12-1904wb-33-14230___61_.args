it has been proved, however, that (1) sugar is a major factor in dental decay; (2) sugar in a person's diet does cause overweight; (3) removal of sugar from diets has cured symptoms of crippling, worldwide diseases such as diabetes, cancer and heart illnesses.natural sweeteners retain most of their vitamins and minerals, and many contain complex carbohydrates.sugars inhibit the function of our immune system, and increase diseases caused by poor immune function, such as colds, flu, aids, allergies, infections, ...this interferes with the function of a part of the body and is the beginning of degenerative disease.insulin also promotes the storage of fat, so when you eat sweets high in sugar and fat, you're making way for rapid weight gain and elevated triglyceride levels, both of which have been linked to cardiovascular disease.one of the major drawbacks is that sugar raises the insulin level, which inhibits the release of growth hormones, which in turn depresses the immune system.consequently, consuming large amounts of refined sugars places an extra burden on the body to supply the nutrients, specifically the b vitamins, chromium, magnesium, and zinc, needed to convert glucose (blood sugar) into energy.an influx of sugar into the blood stream upsets the body's blood sugar balance, triggering the release of insulin, which the body uses to keep blood sugar at a safe and constant level.sugar causes irritation and weakening of the mucous membranes of the body and robs the teeth, bones and blood of a great percentage of their minerals.in addition, sugar is worse than nothing because it drains and leaches the body of precious vitamins and minerals through the demand its digestion, detoxification and elimination make upon one's entire system.natural food can be instrumental in restoring health.a glucose tolerance test at any of these periods could alert parents and physicians and could save innumerable hours and small fortunes spent in looking into the child's psyche and home environment for maladjustments of questionable significance in the emotional development of the average child.the level of beta endorphins have a direct impact on a personâ€™s self esteem, tolerance for pain, sense of connectiveness and to the ability to take personal responsibility for action.according to usda biochemist richard anderson, refined sugar may also impair the absorption of trace minerals like copper and chromium present in some of the other foods we have eaten.any diet which does not consider the quality of carbohydrates and makes the crucial life-and-death distinction between natural, unrefined carbohydrates like whole grains and vegetables and man-refined carbohydrates like sugar and white flour is dangerous.
