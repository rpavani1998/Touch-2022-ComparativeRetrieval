they advertise that magnasweet "can be used in a wide range of applications to enhance, intensify and potentiate flavors; augment or modify sweetness; eliminate or modify bitterness; and mask unpleasant aftertastes."142
inulin may be standardized to an average dp of 22, which is considered to be long-chain inulin.159 these chains of fructose cannot be broken down by the human digestive system, but they can be broken down and consumed by the bacteria in the digestive tract.
for example, given the choice between treating a child’s ear infection with a course of antibiotics or with administration of a therapeutic dose of xylitol, the latter option would certainly be preferable.
the lo han fruit has been used by local people in southern provinces of china for centuries as a sweetener and a medicinal herb for the treatment of lung congestion, colds, sore throats and minor stomach and intestinal problems.
(stevioside, the most commonly-used extractive of stevia, is about 300 times sweeter than sucrose.)120 stevia leaves and stevioside are virtually calorie-free, beneficial in the prevention of cavities and do not trigger a rise in blood sugar.
glycerine (which is technically known as a trihydric alcohol) definitely deserves to be included in the macronutrient arena, even though it defies clear categorization.
to generalize, all of these substances share a relatively limited degree of market share, name recognition, general availability and usage by the food industry or at-home consumers, but they are still worth reviewing.
those who are trying to avoid carbohydrates and burn body fat should also know that sugar alcohols will immediately take the body out of ketosis, the state wherein fat reserves rather than dietary calories are being metabolized. . .
(it should be noted that the extensive scientific studies conducted on stevia by the japanese have not indicated any toxicity or reproductive hazards.)135 in september of 1995, after much thankless effort on the part of many parties, the fda finally relented by revising their 1991 import alert with the issuance of the dietary supplement health and education act.
the fda and ada consider nutritive sweeteners to include anything from raw honey, pure maple syrup, molasses, sorghum or other nutritious options, to such dietary dead-ends as white sugar, high fructose corn syrup and concentrated fruit juices.
clearly, sucralose consumption poses potential hazards which have not been sufficiently acknowledged or studied.
it accumulates within the cells, and reacts with cellular proteins such as enzymes and dna.
it is formed as a result of changes to lactose as heat is applied.
it does not affect blood sugar levels, and so is suitable for diabetics and hypoglycemics.
in 1901, queeny cashed in his personal savings and took out a loan to found a new corporation for the sole purpose of producing its own saccharin for the us market.
they chose it due to the fact that thaumatin molecules have a very unusual crystalline structure, suitable to the research that nasa was doing at the time.)114 immediately grasping upon the potential of this newly-identified sweetener, the british sugar multinational tate & lyle established massive katemfe plantations in ghana, liberia and malaysia in the 1970s.
both the metabolites and unchanged absorbed sucralose are excreted in urine, but some absorbed sucralose has been found to concentrate in the liver, kidney and gastrointestinal tract.76 not only does sucralose break down within the digestive system, but, as the fda notes, "[it] may hydrolyze in some food products…[and] the resulting hydrolysis products may also be ingested by the consumer."

the stevia was all burned and the company was instructed to cease and desist from any further importation.
xylitol has the additional claims of increasing absorption of b-vitamins and calcium, re-mineralizing tooth enamel and fighting/preventing ear infections,99 as well as possibly contributing to fresher breath, greater athletic performance, and recovery from sinus infections.100
this solves certain difficulties that the food industry encounters when trying to mechanically blend sweeteners.
[the] fda allows these nutritive sweeteners to be labeled as having fewer kilocalories per gram than other nutritive sweeteners. . . .
may recounts that he was told in a phone conversation with the fda that (once again) the nutrasweet company had been behind the complaint.
flaws notwithstanding, several pre-approval tests still indicated potential toxicity, although this was written off by the company as insignificant.
these people may experience intestinal distress after consuming foods containing trehalose, whether they be natural sources of the sugar or not.
mother nature clearly did not intend for us to have to suffer from the sugar-free blues.
in 1996, spherix granted a license to arla foods of denmark to produce and market the sweetener.
glycerine does not qualify as a fat since it does not contain fatty acids, and it does not qualify as a protein because it has no amino acids, so the only remaining macronutrient category is the carbohydrates.
there has never been a single documented case of adverse reaction to the consumption of licorice root in its whole, ground-up form.139 this is not quite the case with the extracted glycyrrhizin, which is still very safe for most people but may cause hypertension, edema, sodium retention and mild depletion of potassium when consumed excessively or by certain sensitive individuals.
lactitol frequently finds its way into blends with more potent sweeteners, such as aspartame, saccharin and acesulfame-k. whatever their intended usage, all of the sugar alcohols are touted as being safe for diabetics and hypoglycemics, lower in calories than sugar, and non-contributory towards tooth decay and the growth of intestinal yeasts.
after reviewing the data provided by hoechst’s product safety tests, the center for science in the public interest (cspi) concluded that the company had not done an adequate job with the testing and had ignored problematic data.
however, spherix is currently arbitrating a legal dispute against arla foods concerning the new sweetener, thus delaying the entry of tagatose into the us market.
to generalize, all of these substances share a relatively limited degree of market share, name recognition, general availability and usage by the food industry or at-home consumers, but they are still worth reviewing.
it is also released into the body when a person metabolizes body-fat reserves.
exercising after consuming these types of products may put one at risk for heat stroke, muscle cramping and cardiovascular problems.
more correctly, there are five separate sweet proteins which may be isolated and derived from katemfe berries--thaumatins i, ii, iii, a and b.
in addition, large doses of acetoacetamide, a breakdown product, have been shown to affect the thyroid in rats, rabbits and dogs."59
meanwhile, a st. louis company by the name of meyer brothers drug company had been importing saccharin from germany, and an enterprising young employee by the name of john f. queeny immediately recognized the sweetener’s great potential.
we will all see soon enough how neotame is received by the public.80,81,82 as a concluding remark on all five of the fda-approved non-nutritive sweeteners, it should be noted that many animal studies on these products only yield negative results when test animals are fed the equivalent of several hundred artificially sweetened products daily.
this may be why consumption of tagatose in large amounts reportedly causes gastrointestinal distress, including diarrhea, nausea and flatulence.
information taken from a personal e-mail exchange with overseal color, inc. 113.
notwithstanding the baseless nature of this complaint, sunrider knew that they did not have the economic resources to fight a legal battle with nutrasweet.
if the final product has 50 percent or more of maltitol or sorbitol, it is named accordingly as either a maltitol syrup or sorbitol syrup.
while natives of paraguay have used the stevia plant for many centuries, the western world has also had a few centuries of experience with this sweet plant, dating back much earlier than bertoni’s time.
this is a potential concern to those who consume a lot of low-carb, energy bar types of foods.
to further dispute the manufacturer’s claims, research indicates that about 20 to 30 percent of the absorbed sucralose is metabolized.
this is possible due to the fact that some high-intensity sweeteners form positively charged ions in certain solutions, whereas others form negatively charged ions.
one of these conditions is metabolic acidosis, which can lead to acid reflux and an increased risk of cancer of the larynx.
sulfonamide compounds have been shown to cause dermatological reactions in those who are allergic to sulfa drugs, especially in children.
both sugar alcohols and non-nutritive sweeteners can replace sugar sweeteners and are therefore termed macronutrient substitutes, sugar substitutes, sugar replacers, or alternative sweeteners.
if the final product has 50 percent or more of maltitol or sorbitol, it is named accordingly as either a maltitol syrup or sorbitol syrup.
it is here in the bowels that the "passive diffusion" mentioned by the ada takes place, meaning that the presence of the sugar alcohols draws water into the bowels.
one liter of a beverage sweetened with aspartame may contain as much as 56 milligrams of methanol.18 other sources also link aspartame consumption with parkinson’s disease, alzheimer’s disease and the gulf war syndrome experienced by u.s. soldiers after serving in iraq during operation: desert storm.19 according to dr. christine lydon, an accomplished aspartame researcher: "aspartame’s breakdown products, or metabolites, are even scarier than its components.
the neurotoxic effects of these amino acids, when consumed as isolates, can be linked to headaches, mental confusion, balance problems and possibly seizures.
this is possible due to the fact that some high-intensity sweeteners form positively charged ions in certain solutions, whereas others form negatively charged ions.
according to the splenda website, "sucralose, is made from sugar through a patented, multi-step process that selectively replaces three hydrogen-oxygen groups on the sugar molecule with three chlorine atoms.
this would have left the fda in the position of having to publicly defend its actions, something which they were unwilling to do.
the fda also admits that aspartic acid has the potential to cause brain damage at very high doses, but they assure us that "under normal intake levels, the brain’s mechanism for controlling aspartic acid levels ensures no adverse effects."
dried lo han fruit is frequently available in chinese and oriental markets, or may be ordered online at www.chinanaturalproduct.com/whole_dried_lo_han_kuo_fruit.htm.
in 1977, canadian scientists found that high doses of saccharin seemed to cause cancer in laboratory rats.
may, who had only been selling between $100 and $200 worth of stevia per month, says that he was also told by one fda agent that "if [the fda] wanted to make carrots [be] against the law, we could do it."128
when the final product contains 50 percent or more of hydrogenated glucose, it is called a hydrogenated glucose syrup.
flaws notwithstanding, several pre-approval tests still indicated potential toxicity, although this was written off by the company as insignificant.
in an amazing display of sweetening power, neotame hits the scales at 8000 times sweeter than sucrose, and its chemical name is a mouthful--n-[n-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-l-a-aspartyl]-l-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester.
in fact, it is one of the most commonly-used herbs worldwide.
the fda has also alluded to several south american studies which have supposedly questioned the safety of stevia, although they admit that they have never even been able to acquire copies of these studies.
by 1977 the maruzen kasei co., ltd. started extracting stevioside on a commercial basis in japan.
glycerine does not qualify as a fat since it does not contain fatty acids, and it does not qualify as a protein because it has no amino acids, so the only remaining macronutrient category is the carbohydrates.
tests performed by the japanese food sanitation council have found that as much as 40 percent of ingested sucralose is absorbed.
consumed in moderation as part of a nutrient-dense diet that includes plenty of good quality fats, these mineral-rich, naturally sweet foods allow us to enjoy the sweet taste while nourishing the body at the same time.
be categorized as sugar replacers because they can replace sugar sweeteners, usually on a one-to-one basis; offer less energy; and offer potential health benefits, such as reduced glycemic response and reduced dental caries risk.
these candy "licorices" are typically mixtures of corn syrup, sugar, flour, margarine and artificial flavorings.)
the burden of proving that such synthetic compounds are safe, from the process of their creation through the human digestive system and into our environment, should fall upon the purveyors of these chemicals.
there has never been a single documented case of adverse reaction to the consumption of licorice root in its whole, ground-up form.139 this is not quite the case with the extracted glycyrrhizin, which is still very safe for most people but may cause hypertension, edema, sodium retention and mild depletion of potassium when consumed excessively or by certain sensitive individuals.
sugar alcohols are not broken down in the stomach, so they make their way intact into the bowels.
the study documented only very scant information about the quantities of stevia which the mice consumed and how it was prepared.
key rat tests were afflicted by disease in the animal colonies; a mouse study was several months too brief and did not expose animals during gestation.
it is also released into the body when a person metabolizes body-fat reserves.
the reader is strongly advised to thoroughly research these plants before attempting to ingest any part(s) of them.
chlorinated molecules, which are used as the basis for pesticides such as ddt, tend to accumulate in body tissues.
it has reportedly captured over 50% of the japanese sweetening market,125 even though the japanese technically classify it as a food additive.
a person ingesting the tdi for some chemical may find that it causes cancer, or immune system or neurological problems, after many years or decades of use.
however, it is still used in 50 countries around the world--the major producers and exporters are located in china, indonesia, taiwan and spain86--so it almost certainly still finds its way into the us via products from these countries.
hayashibara’s trehalose is the only source currently in production, and japan is by far the largest consumer of products containing trehalose.
he wrote of the fruit's "extraordinary power on the palate," and clearly identified its capabilities "to enhance flavours and mask off-notes."112
fitness-conscious people may appreciate glycerine because it increases blood volume (thus helping delay dehydration when exercising), enhances temperature regulation and is claimed to improve physical performance in the heat.
the berries were frozen and shipped to its factories in the uk.
while sugar alcohols may indeed occur in nature, their usage as sweeteners also suffers from the same problem as many other sweeteners, pharmaceutical drugs and other substances today--one single factor from a natural food item is being isolated from its normal co-constituents and consumed at levels that are difficult to obtain when eating the food item itself.
of these, the author’s two product recommendations are slim & sweet from wisdom natural brands ( www.wisdomherbs.com) and sweetlife from chi fai’s inc. ( www.chifaisgourmet.com/cfsweetlife2.htm).
according to the ada website: "all [sugar alcohols] are absorbed slowly and incompletely from the intestine by passive diffusion.

glycyrrhizin is between 50 and 100 times sweeter than sucrose, but it also imparts a definite (and familiar) aftertaste of licorice.
in 1903, the monsanto corporation began to ship saccharin to a little-known company in georgia called coca-cola.
one of these conditions is metabolic acidosis, which can lead to acid reflux and an increased risk of cancer of the larynx.
when we took them over to the area where we had the stevia, the inspector dug out a bunch of red tags and started slapping them on everything."
the food industry, in their never-ending quest to increase their profits and jeopardize the safety of our foods, later found a way to use genetic engineering and gene splicing to produce the sweet thaumatin proteins from bacterial cultures, thus by-passing the need to cultivate, harvest, transport and process any katemfe berries.
apologists for non-nutritive sweeteners point to this as a way of dismissing negative test data.
and, as it is not metabolized by the body, it is excreted unchanged in the urine.52 it was discovered in 1967 by a german chemist, karl clauss, who was working with derivatives of acetoacetic acid.53 in what should now be a familiar theme, the sweetness of one particular derivative revealed itself one day when he licked his finger to pick up a piece of paper.54 at the time, mr. clauss was employed at a german chemical company by the name of the hoechst group.
saccharin is the most thoroughly tested of all the non-nutritive sweeteners--more than 2374 studies have been done, with aspartame coming in second at 598.49 even the most staunch critics are left to admit that no one has been able to draw a definite link between saccharin consumption (even at high levels) and cancer in humans.
the low level of sweetness has limited the applications of trehalose as a sweetening agent, but it has not stopped the food industry from finding other uses.
(this fermentation of intestinal bacteria can lead to or exacerbate problems with candida and other yeast problems.)
the low level of sweetness has limited the applications of trehalose as a sweetening agent, but it has not stopped the food industry from finding other uses.
as more and more us sugar was being sent across the ocean to the soldiers in europe, the sweetening needs of the populace at home were met with cheap and plentiful saccharin.
nhdc does not function well as the sole sweetening agent in food items due to its slow onset of sweetness and a lingering menthol or licorice aftertaste.
as mr. nielson himself recalls, "i thought it was strange because they asked specifically to see the stevia [whereas normally] they would just go through and have a look at everything….
clearly, sucralose consumption poses potential hazards which have not been sufficiently acknowledged or studied.
the fda stonewalled this information and dragged their feet until sadler, the ahpa and pendergast were finally forced to drop the matter, which was draining much time and money.
it is likely for this reason that some people experience gastric distress after consuming foods containing nonspecific blends of fos--if one already has a problem with the balance of the intestinal flora, a nonspecific blend of fos may exacerbate the problem.161 aside from feeding the bacteria of the digestive tract, all forms of fos act as dietary fiber.
the neurotoxic effects of these amino acids, when consumed as isolates, can be linked to headaches, mental confusion, balance problems and possibly seizures.
it almost certainly still finds its way into the us via products from these countries.
while neotame has not yet been introduced into any markets, critics surmise that all of the toxic effects of aspartame and more will plague consumers of neotame.
while sugar alcohols are certainly the lesser of two evils when compared to the non-nutritive sweeteners, they should be consumed with prudence if at all.
alike, whereas standardized extracts of long-chain inulin will selectively nourish only the friendly flora.
"20 supporters of aspartame claim that the levels of methanol are not high enough to be worrisome and that phenylalanine and aspartic acid are of only limited concern.
the product they created, at an impressive 600 times sweeter than sucrose, would be known as sucralose and marketed as splenda.
just because they have not been commercially utilized doesn’t necessarily mean that one could not attempt to cultivate them and do some personal experimentation.
the rest, as they say, is history.34,35 saccharin’s early history in the us was somewhat rocky.
additional concerns with sugar alcohols stem from the fact that they seem to increase the frequency of seizures in epileptics, and children are especially sensitive to the gastrointestinal side effects, possibly due to their propensity for bingeing on sweet foods.
neotame, another product of monsanto’s nutrasweet company and also the most recently approved sweetener, deserves several red flags of caution.
stevia is also used as a sweet food additive in south korea, brazil, argentina and paraguay, and as a dietary supplement in china, western europe and the u.s.126 stevia did not have a very easy entry into the u.s. market.
this appears to be the only safety issue with trehalose.
nutritive sweeteners include sugar sweeteners (e.g., refined sugars, high fructose corn syrup, crystalline fructose, glucose. . .
according to the ada website: "all [sugar alcohols] are absorbed slowly and incompletely from the intestine by passive diffusion.
for these and other reasons, it has found more favor as a component of sweetener blends and as a flavor-modifying/enhancing agent.
lynda sadler, president of the california-based traditional medicinals herbal-tea company, along with the american herbal products association (ahpa) and an attorney by the name of william r. pendergast, started to work on persuading the fda that the marketing of stevia should be permitted based on its having been used safely and widely in food prior to 1958.
it also takes the prize as the sweetener with the most bizarre application--a japanese company recently began to market a line of women’s t-shirts with xylitol infused into the fabric.
if anyone has bothered to specifically research the effects of hydrogenating sugars, that information is not readily available at this time.
they are not only safe for diabetics and hypoglycemics, but in some countries stevia leaves are even prescribed as a medicinal substance for these conditions because they normalize pancreatic function and thus aid in the metabolism of sugar.121
thus, consumption of fos may help to shorten fecal transit time, increase fecal bulk and reduces constipation.
the exception to this is its use in herbal tea blends, where the licorice aftertaste may be blended quite well with other tastes.
this cumulative reaction could spell grave consequences for those who consume aspartame-laden diet drinks and foods on a daily basis.
some chemicals are much more than 10 times more toxic in humans than in rodents (or will cause cancer in humans in low-dose, long-term exposure and do not cause cancer in rodents at all).
in 1901, queeny cashed in his personal savings and took out a loan to found a new corporation for the sole purpose of producing its own saccharin for the us market.
may recounts that he was told in a phone conversation with the fda that (once again) the nutrasweet company had been behind the complaint.
if a person has a neutral or positive state of general metabolic energy, glycerine may be (at least partially) excreted unchanged, metabolized into phoshoglycerides for use within cell membranes, or used in the conversion of extra dietary calories into body fat.
this is the holy grail of the artificial sweetener industry--compounds that taste sweet, are stable in prepackaged foods and beverages, and which are so foreign to the human diet that our digestive system cannot metabolize them to create any dietary calories.
for this reason, fos is considered to be a prebiotic--a substance which provides nourishment for the gastrointestinal flora.
(is) expressed as the acceptable daily intake (adi), that is, the estimated amount per kilogram body weight that a person can safely consume every day over a lifetime without risk.. . .
(this fermentation of intestinal bacteria can lead to or exacerbate problems with candida and other yeast problems.)
as with lactose (another disaccharide) which requires a special enzyme, lactase, to break it down, a small percentage of people are genetically prone towards deficiency in trehalase, the enzyme that metabolizes trehalose.
xylitol, like several other sugar alcohols, exhibits a cooling effect in the mouth.
this solves certain difficulties that the food industry encounters when trying to mechanically blend sweeteners.
xylitol has the additional claims of increasing absorption of b-vitamins and calcium, re-mineralizing tooth enamel and fighting/preventing ear infections,99 as well as possibly contributing to fresher breath, greater athletic performance, and recovery from sinus infections.100
independent studies have shown formaldehyde formation, resulting from aspartame ingestion, to be extremely common.
(of course it is also helpful for the compounds to be dirt cheap to produce in bulk.)
one of the next major targets would be the colorado-based tea company celestial seasonings.
modern scientific research has shown that lo han extracts help relieve gastritis, constipation and respiratory inflammations, and they also appear to inhibit the epstein-barr virus and display anti-carcinogenic properties.148 while the fda has not made any conclusive rulings upon the status of lo han and its extractives, they are currently available to u.s. consumers and have not been opposed in any way by regulatory authorities.
therefore, an excessive load (e.g., greater than 50 g sorbitol per day, greater than 20 g mannitol per day) may cause diarrhea. . . .
industry-sponsored tests did not find any safety issues with the use of nhdc, and also ruled that it does not promote cavities.
spanish conquistadors of the sixteenth century learned about stevia from the local guarani and mato grosso societies, who used it to sweeten teas and herbal medicines.
as with saccharin, the prudent consumer would be wise to seek out better options.
consequently, it triggers no rise in blood sugar levels and is completely safe for diabetics and hypoglycemics.
the european union, switzerland, the czech republic and turkey allow it to be used as a sweetener.
initially, may received confirmation that there would be no problems with importing the whole leaves of the plant or a liquid concentrate of stevioside.
the fda itself has stated that "increases in glycosolation in hemoglobin imply lessening of control in diabetes.
as so frequently happens when a nation has to buckle down for a protracted war, resources in the us had to be rationed in order to provide for the troops abroad.
in the final analysis glycerine is a sweetening option worth experimenting with, unless one is pregnant or has high blood pressure, diabetes or kidney disease.
this leads to the fermentation by undesirable bacteria and a resultant partial degradation or "metabolism" of the sugar alcohols.
after consumption, sucralose passes through the body without being broken down.
however, the inspectors did not take any samples of the stevia with them in order to test for contamination.
it accumulates within the cells, and reacts with cellular proteins such as enzymes and dna.
low, which mixed saccharine with cyclamate (to counter the metallic aftertaste of saccharin) in the small packet form that we still know today.
this leads to the fermentation by undesirable bacteria and a resultant partial degradation or "metabolism" of the sugar alcohols.
(it is not cheap, though--1 ounce of the dried fruit goes for $30.)
64 sucralose may have the strangest "accidental discovery" story of all.
hydrogenation of fats and oils is certainly detrimental to the nutritive qualities of said items, but the process must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
to quote from dr. joseph mercola’s website ( www.mercola.com/2000/dec/3/sucralose_dangers.htm): "although sucralose is being flushed down toilets [after human excretion]. . .
tagatose tagatose, known scientifically as d-tagatose, is very new to the sweetening scene and there is comparatively little to be said about it.
try to seek out glycerine available from a product line which is trustworthy--frontier natural products is one reliable source, available on the internet at www.frontiercoop.com/shop/merchant.mvc (search under the "glycerin" spelling).
world war ii again brought sugar rationing and a dramatic increase in saccharin usage, which this time did not decline with the war’s end.38 however, during that period, saccharin took on second-place status as cyclamate, another artificial sweetener discovered in 1937, came on the scene.39 in 1958, marvin eisenstadt, owner of cumberland packing company in brooklyn, ny, introduced sweet‘n low, which mixed saccharine with cyclamate (to counter the metallic aftertaste of saccharin) in the small packet form that we still know today.
additionally, independent reviewers of johnson & johnson’s tests have found them to be inadequate and methodologically flawed.
industry-sponsored tests did not find any safety issues with the use of nhdc, and also ruled that it does not promote cavities.
the final word on sugar alcohols as a group seems to be a mixed message.
while neotame has not yet been introduced into any markets, critics surmise that all of the toxic effects of aspartame and more will plague consumers of neotame.
the result is an exceptionally stable sweetener that tastes like sugar, but without sugar’s calories.
and diabetics and hypoglycemics should be aware that sugar alcohols do raise blood sugar levels, although not as much as sugar.
a native of paraguay and a member of the sunflower family, the stevia plant is botanically known as stevia rebaudiana.
while natives of paraguay have used the stevia plant for many centuries, the western world has also had a few centuries of experience with this sweet plant, dating back much earlier than bertoni’s time.
162 due to the relatively-low sweetness of fos and inulin, it is easier to use it for sweetening purposes in combination with another sweet substance.
any one of them just may turn up on a product label one day, and having some knowledge of what a substance is may help each of us to make informed purchases.
21 this dismissal of phenylalanine and aspartic acid as significant health hazards is a dangerous bit of sleight of hand.
the fda stonewalled this information and dragged their feet until sadler, the ahpa and pendergast were finally forced to drop the matter, which was draining much time and money.
on their own, they enter the central nervous system in abnormally high concentrations, causing aberrant neuronal firing and potential cell death.
indeed, the fda showed very little interest in saccharin until 1969, when researchers discovered that cyclamate was carcinogenic in laboratory mice.
they advertise that magnasweet "can be used in a wide range of applications to enhance, intensify and potentiate flavors; augment or modify sweetness; eliminate or modify bitterness; and mask unpleasant aftertastes."142
even if one does not consume any glycerine as an ingredient of any food items, it is normally liberated from various naturally occurring food sources during the digestive process.
as with saccharin, the prudent consumer would be wise to seek out better options.
those who suffer from candida or other yeast problems may find it especially beneficial.
since no specific monitoring practices or epidemiological studies of acesulfame-k are currently in progress, it is possible that relevant data may not be gathered for some time.
for example, given the choice between treating a child’s ear infection with a course of antibiotics or with administration of a therapeutic dose of xylitol, the latter option would certainly be preferable.
even if these "impurities" are within existing manufacturing guidelines, they are still all potentially dangerous to human health.77 sucralose production and consumption may also pose a threat to the environment in general.
in strict moderation, they can even be used by diabetics in conjunction with a nutrient-dense, high-fat diet.
even if products are consistently kept at cooler temperatures we are not safe.
independent studies have shown formaldehyde formation, resulting from aspartame ingestion, to be extremely common.
additionally, as the fda again acknowledges, sucralose may contain up to 2 percent of various impurities, such as heavy metals, arsenic, triphenilphosphine oxide, methanol, chlorinated disaccharides and chlorinated monosaccharides.
it is a heat-stable compound, 2000 times sweeter than sucrose, which could potentially be incorporated into any sweetened product.
the simple answer is that glycerine is utilized by the body in different ways (or not at all) depending upon the state one is in when one consumes it.
this author’s personal favorite stevia products are available from wisdom natural brands, found at www.wisdomherbs.com .
the number of fructose molecules which are bound together is called the "degree of polymerization," or dp, and it varies according to the plant source, type of climate, time of harvest, and the duration and conditions of post-harvest storage.

if a person has a neutral or positive state of general metabolic energy, glycerine may be (at least partially) excreted unchanged, metabolized into phoshoglycerides for use within cell membranes, or used in the conversion of extra dietary calories into body fat.
lynda sadler, president of the california-based traditional medicinals herbal-tea company, along with the american herbal products association (ahpa) and an attorney by the name of william r. pendergast, started to work on persuading the fda that the marketing of stevia should be permitted based on its having been used safely and widely in food prior to 1958.
even if products are consistently kept at cooler temperatures we are not safe.
while the johnson & johnson corporation claims that they have hundreds of self-conducted studies demonstrating the product’s safety, sucralose has the fewest independent scientific tests to its credit of all non-nutritive sweeteners.
lactitol in particular may be problematic in small doses, especially for lactose-sensitive individuals.103,104 stomach cramping and diarrhea are certainly not as serious as the conditions associated with some of the non-nutritive sweeteners, but the sugar alcohols can cause other more serious problems.
by 1977 the maruzen kasei co., ltd. started extracting stevioside on a commercial basis in japan.
the material safety data sheet on aspartame (cas# 22839-47-0) says that to work with the sweetener, one should wear chemical goggles, protective gloves to prevent skin exposure, a chemical apron and a nios/msha approved air purifying dust or mist respirator.16 whatever else one may say about refined white sugar, at least one doesn’t have to wear chemical goggles to work with it!
lactitol frequently finds its way into blends with more potent sweeteners, such as aspartame, saccharin and acesulfame-k. whatever their intended usage, all of the sugar alcohols are touted as being safe for diabetics and hypoglycemics, lower in calories than sugar, and non-contributory towards tooth decay and the growth of intestinal yeasts.
he observed that the local people used it "to improve sour fruit and bad palm wine."
to deal with this category, we must first rid ourselves of the silly idea that the word "nutritive" necessarily indicates that a substance will contribute anything positive to our general well being.
in an amazing display of sweetening power, neotame hits the scales at 8000 times sweeter than sucrose, and its chemical name is a mouthful--n-[n-(3,3-dimethylbutyl)-l-a-aspartyl]-l-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester.
[the] fda allows these nutritive sweeteners to be labeled as having fewer kilocalories per gram than other nutritive sweeteners.
it is formed as a result of changes to lactose as heat is applied.
in this case, that compound is known as glycyrrhizin (or also glycyrrhizic acid).
(it should be noted that certain individuals should avoid consuming excessive amounts of glycerine due to the very fact that it does increase blood volume.
johnson & johnson maintains that sucralose passes through the digestive system without any absorption or metabolization, but the fda’s own research has shown that 11 to 27 percent of sucralose is absorbed in humans, while the rest is excreted unchanged in the feces.
sugar alcohols also promote dehydration and loss of electrolytes, creating feelings of excessive thirst.
in this case and the previous attempts by pendergast et al., the fda ignored their usual protocol and refused to even file the petitions for approval.
so it seems that tagatose only occurs "in nature" to the same extent that heat-treated dairy products occur "in nature."
for this reason, it is traditionally consumed and served during the hot summer months in china.
the brazilian study involved an overly-small group of mice and suffered from a number of methodological and design flaws.
traditional chinese doctors consider it to be a yin substance, meaning that it releases excess heat from the body.
toluene is also used in the manufacture of certain dyes, pharmaceutical drugs and trinitrotoluene, the blasting agent more commonly known as tnt.26 saccharin is currently manufactured by a more cost-effective method, beginning with synthetically produced methyl anthranilate, a compound that also occurs naturally in grape and other fruit juices.
162 due to the relatively-low sweetness of fos and inulin, it is easier to use it for sweetening purposes in combination with another sweet substance.
157 fos is commonly extracted from chicory roots and jerusalem artichokes (as it occurs in relatively large quantities in these items), but it is also found in onions, leeks, garlic, common artichokes, bananas, rye, barley, dandelion leaves, burdock roots and honey.
the material safety data sheet on aspartame (cas# 22839-47-0) says that to work with the sweetener, one should wear chemical goggles, protective gloves to prevent skin exposure, a chemical apron and a nios/msha approved air purifying dust or mist respirator.16 whatever else one may say about refined white sugar, at least one doesn’t have to wear chemical goggles to work with it!
sweeteners from the hsh family commonly serve as viscosity or bodifying agents, humectants, crystallization modifiers, cryoprotectants, and rehydration aids.
in this case and the previous attempts by pendergast et al., the fda ignored their usual protocol and refused to even file the petitions for approval.
in strict moderation, they can even be used by diabetics in conjunction with a nutrient-dense, high-fat diet.
a cursory glance down the aisles of any grocery store these days will reveal a host of sugar-free, low-calorie products, all promising to be the dieter’s best friend.
"lo han: a natural sweetener comes of age,"whole foods, june 2003, by peilin guo and dallas clouatre.
this would include pregnant women and people who suffer from high blood pressure, diabetes or kidney diseases.)151 glycerine is also a source of lecithin and tocopherols (vitamin e).152 food-grade glycerine is produced from animal sources (usually tallow), vegetable sources (various vegetable oils) and from propylene alcohol.
the evidence does seem to support the positive claims made on behalf of these sweeteners, and perhaps this gives them a valid place in certain applications.
a case may certainly be made that lo han should be allowed as a gras substance due to its substantial history of safe usage prior to 1958.
the energy return from indirect metabolism is less than the direct route; thus, [sugar alcohols] are referred to as reduced-energy or low-energy sweeteners.
sugar alcohols (e.g., sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, isomalt, and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates).
it does not affect blood sugar levels, and so is suitable for diabetics and hypoglycemics.
while talin is not commercially available to the average consumer in this country, it is possible to order the dried, unprocessed fruit of the katemfe plant online atwww.bouncingb.com/thaumatococcus_danielli.php .
meanwhile, a st. louis company by the name of meyer brothers drug company had been importing saccharin from germany, and an enterprising young employee by the name of john f. queeny immediately recognized the sweetener’s great potential.
for these and other reasons, it has found more favor as a component of sweetener blends and as a flavor-modifying/enhancing agent.
this would include pregnant women and people who suffer from high blood pressure, diabetes or kidney diseases.)151 glycerine is also a source of lecithin and tocopherols (vitamin e).152 food-grade glycerine is produced from animal sources (usually tallow), vegetable sources (various vegetable oils) and from propylene alcohol.
it is safe for diabetics, but its lack of versatility as an all-around sweetening agent limits its potential applications.
jim may, founder and president of the company, had even gone so far as to submit test samples of stevia to the fda to assure that it would be okay to use it in the company’s products.
a team from the fda conducted its own study of searle’s data and on the corpses of aspartame-poisoned mice, and issued a scathing document called the bressler report.10 this report, however, did not spell the end for aspartame.
the plant of which licorice root is the root is the blue flowering pea plant, botanically known as glycyrrhiza glabra.
neotame neotame, another product of monsanto’s nutrasweet company and also the most recently approved sweetener, deserves several red flags of caution.
according to fahlberg’s account, he accidentally spilled some laboratory material on his hand and noticed the sweet taste later in the evening when he was eating dinner.
due to its low sweetness (in comparison to many artificial sweeteners) and strong aftertaste, it has not enjoyed much success as a commercial sweetener.
it is a heat-stable compound, 2000 times sweeter than sucrose, which could potentially be incorporated into any sweetened product.
some of the remaining sweeteners are not classified by the fda as being sweeteners at all, yet they undeniably possess some degree of sweetness.
it has also been shown to reduce both cholesterol and triglyceride levels and may provide improved absorption of minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron, and phosphate.
it is interesting to note that even the manufacturers and the official regulatory bodies hint at the potential problems with sugar alcohols.
tagatose is 92 percent as sweet as sucrose and is said to occur "naturally" in heated cow’s milk and some other presumably heat-treated dairy products.
the berries were frozen and shipped to its factories in the uk.
the two then performed similar experiments on other citrus derivatives and discovered several additional sweet compounds, but it was only the original product, nhdc, which would go on to have commercial application.
some sources say that glycerine from propylene alcohol is irritating to the skin and scalp when used in topical products.153 non-food-grade glycerine is a major by-product in the production of biodiesel fuels.
some of the end products do not contain a specific sugar alcohol in any clear majority; these are simply referred to by the generalized term--hydrogenated starch hydrolysate.
the two then performed similar experiments on other citrus derivatives and discovered several additional sweet compounds, but it was only the original product, nhdc, which would go on to have commercial application.
i know of no studies showing what happens to the chemical when the raw sewage is treated and then released back into the environment.
it has reportedly captured over 50% of the japanese sweetening market,125 even though the japanese technically classify it as a food additive.
the simple answer is that glycerine is utilized by the body in different ways (or not at all) depending upon the state one is in when one consumes it.
"lo han: a natural sweetener comes of age" article from whole foods, june 2003, by peilin guo and dallas clouatre.
methanol is also found in fruit juices, and our regulatory agencies have seized upon this fact to assure us that the methanol by-product of aspartame is not harmful.
cspi has also gone on record as saying that the hoechst scientists "followed inadequate protocols, which are greatly at variance with current standards for test design, execution and reporting required for the national toxicology program’s bioassays.
to quote from dr. janet starr hull: "saccharin is not genotoxic; the presumed mechanism of toxicity is the binding of saccharin to urinary proteins (not normally found in humans), creating a nidus for the formation of silicate crystals, which are cytotoxic to bladder epithelium (of rats)."50 however--and this is the important part--while the fda has chosen to say that it cannot be proven that saccharin’s effect on mice is relevant to humans, one could just as easily say that the studies have failed to prove that there is no link between saccharin and bladder cancer in humans.
chlorinated molecules, which are used as the basis for pesticides such as ddt, tend to accumulate in body tissues.
the number of fructose molecules which are bound together is called the "degree of polymerization," or dp, and it varies according to the plant source, type of climate, time of harvest, and the duration and conditions of post-harvest storage.
saccharin may be found in ingredient lists under three slightly variant forms--acid saccharin, sodium saccharin and calcium saccharin.27 unlike aspartame, saccharin is not metabolized by the human body and is excreted rapidly through the urine.28
however, the inspectors did not take any samples of the stevia with them in order to test for contamination.
some of the remaining sweeteners are not classified by the fda as being sweeteners at all, yet they undeniably possess some degree of sweetness.
products with sorbitol and mannitol may have the following statement on the label because high intakes increase the risk of malabsorption: ‘excess consumption may have a laxative effect.
they were found to be 3000 times sweeter than sucrose, thus making thaumatin the sweetest natural substance known to man.113 (thaumatin also has the unusual distinction of having been selected by nasa to be synthesized in a space lab orbiting the earth.
cspi has also gone on record as saying that the hoechst scientists "followed inadequate protocols, which are greatly at variance with current standards for test design, execution and reporting required for the national toxicology program’s bioassays.
once a petition is filed, the information submitted becomes available for public review during the same time period in which the fda is reviewing it.
magnasweet is currently only available to the food processing industry.
the difference is virtually irrelevant to your tongue, but the digestive system has no idea how to handle this unnatural molecule, just as the body cannot properly assimilate many synthetic vitamins, which are mirror images of their natural counterparts.
one of those resources was table sugar.
additionally, as the fda again acknowledges, sucralose may contain up to 2 percent of various impurities, such as heavy metals, arsenic, triphenilphosphine oxide, methanol, chlorinated disaccharides and chlorinated monosaccharides.
under continuing harassment, celestial seasonings relented on both counts.129 it would preserve some small measure of the fda’s dignity if these had only been isolated incidents, or even if they were the worst incidents of their kind…but it gets worse.
hayashibara’s trehalose is the only source currently in production, and japan is by far the largest consumer of products containing trehalose.
in 1963, nhdc was discovered by two researchers by the names of horowitz and gentili who were studying bitter compounds found in citrus fruits.
essentially, neotame molecules are aspartame molecules chemically combined with a neohexyl group.
the weston a. price foundation for wise traditions in food, farming, and the healing arts.
after the us cyclamate ban, would-be producers were legally obligated to prove its safety to the fda’s satisfaction if it was to be re-approved.
according to dr. christine lydon, an accomplished aspartame researcher: "aspartame’s breakdown products, or metabolites, are even scarier than its components.
prebiotics, like probiotics (such as live-culture yogurt--substances which actually contain the same bacteria which are the beneficial flora in the human digestive tract), help promote regularity, prevent yeast overgrowth and are beneficial for those with crohn’s disease, colitis or who are on kidney dialysis.
it is here in the bowels that the "passive diffusion" mentioned by the ada takes place, meaning that the presence of the sugar alcohols draws water into the bowels.
sugar alcohols (e.g., sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, isomalt, and hydrogenated starch hydrolysates).
initially, may received confirmation that there would be no problems with importing the whole leaves of the plant or a liquid concentrate of stevioside.
essentially, neotame molecules are aspartame molecules chemically combined with a neohexyl group.
while the author could not find any information commenting on this fact, the use of a hydrogenation process may or may not be of concern.
lactitol in particular may be problematic in small doses, especially for lactose-sensitive individuals.103,104 stomach cramping and diarrhea are certainly not as serious as the conditions associated with some of the non-nutritive sweeteners, but the sugar alcohols can cause other more serious problems.
when trehalose is ingested, it undergoes a similar digestive process as other disaccharides; it is enzymatically broken into individual glucose molecules which the body then metabolizes.
previously it had been too expensive to extract or produce commercially, but hayashibara biochemical laboratories of okayama, japan developed a feasible method using the action of soil microorganisms on starch.
"98 it should be noted that lactitol, mannitol and some of the hydrogenated starch hydrolysates have less than half of the sweetening power of sucrose, and for this reason are usually employed for other purposes.
some chemicals are much more than 10 times more toxic in humans than in rodents (or will cause cancer in humans in low-dose, long-term exposure and do not cause cancer in rodents at all).
while sugar alcohols are certainly the lesser of two evils when compared to the non-nutritive sweeteners, they should be consumed with prudence if at all.
the only explanation given by the inspectors for this action was "suspicion of adulteration," which usually means contamination of some sort.
"researchers at utah state university found that even at low levels aspartame induces adverse changes in the pituitary glands of mice.
usage of saccharin leveled off when sugar became available once again, but it had entered the scene to stay.
sucralose the fourth fda-approved non-nutritive sweetener is sucralose, chemically known as 1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-beta-d-fructofuranosyl-4-chloro-4-deoxy-alpha-d-galactopyranoside.
traditional chinese doctors consider it to be a yin substance, meaning that it releases excess heat from the body.
this would have left the fda in the position of having to publicly defend its actions, something which they were unwilling to do.
hydrogenation of fats and oils is certainly detrimental to the nutritive qualities of said items, but the process must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
it also takes the prize as the sweetener with the most bizarre application--a japanese company recently began to market a line of women’s t-shirts with xylitol infused into the fabric.
(it is not cheap, though--1 ounce of the dried fruit goes for $30.)
while the rats in the study did suffer from the effects of toxicity and from a reduction in the numbers of offspring, kuc points out that they were fed the entire stevia plant, not just the sweet leaves.
for this very reason, japanese and dutch regulatory agencies agree that the total daily consumption of glycyrrhizin should not exceed 200 milligrams.
the direct result of this chain of events is the severe stomach cramping and diarrhea that many people experience after ingesting too much sugar alcohol.
also, there has been talk of growing canadian stevia as a cash crop, possibly even replacing canadian tobacco.137 to summarize, while we will all have to wait to see what the future holds for stevia, we should not wait to begin using it and reaping its benefits.
this is a potential concern to those who consume a lot of low-carb, energy bar types of foods.
sucralose is also said to be diabetic-safe, as it does not increase blood sugar levels.
traditions may already know that the words "sugar-free" on a product label frequently translate into "do not take internally--contains aspartame," but what about all of the other sugar substitutes out there?
inulin may be standardized to an average dp of 22, which is considered to be long-chain inulin.159 these chains of fructose cannot be broken down by the human digestive system, but they can be broken down and consumed by the bacteria in the digestive tract.
nutritive sweeteners include sugar sweeteners (e.g., refined sugars, high fructose corn syrup, crystalline fructose, glucose. . .
not only does sucralose break down within the digestive system, but, as the fda notes, "[it] may hydrolyze in some food products…[and] the resulting hydrolysis products may also be ingested by the consumer."
although soft drinks account for more than 70 percent of aspartame consumption, this sweetener is added to more than 6,000 foods, personal care products, and pharmaceuticals.
certainly the best answer would be to give up soft drinks entirely in favor of a more health-promoting alternative, but this is much easier said than done for many long-time addicts of the sugar-water industry.
however--and this is the important part--while the fda has chosen to say that it cannot be proven that saccharin’s effect on mice is relevant to humans, one could just as easily say that the studies have failed to prove that there is no link between saccharin and bladder cancer in humans.
to further dispute the manufacturer’s claims, research indicates that about 20 to 30 percent of the absorbed sucralose is metabolized.
higher authorities in the fda quietly consigned the bressler report to the archives, and only made it public later, through a freedom of information act request.11 while the public remained ignorant, searle & co had maneuvered to bring in donald rumsfeld, previously the chief of staff in the ford administration and the then secretary of defense, as their new ceo.
fitness-conscious people may appreciate glycerine because it increases blood volume (thus helping delay dehydration when exercising), enhances temperature regulation and is claimed to improve physical performance in the heat.
to quote from dr. janet starr hull: "saccharin is not genotoxic; the presumed mechanism of toxicity is the binding of saccharin to urinary proteins (not normally found in humans), creating a nidus for the formation of silicate crystals, which are cytotoxic to bladder epithelium (of rats)."50
"74 it is not only diabetics who need worry about the safety of sucralose.
they fail to point out that the methanol content of a diet soft drink is 15 to 100 times higher than that of fruit juices."
more correctly, there are five separate sweet proteins which may be isolated and derived from katemfe berries--thaumatins i, ii, iii, a and b.
a person ingesting the tdi for some chemical may find that it causes cancer, or immune system or neurological problems, after many years or decades of use.
according to dr. lydon, "phenylalanine and aspartic acid are amino acids that are normally supplied by the foods we eat; however, they can only be considered natural and harmless when consumed in combination with other amino acids.
at cold temperatures, methanol will spontaneously give rise to a colorless toxin known as formaldehyde.
prolonged storage, particularly at high temperatures and low ph, causes sucralose to break down into other chemicals, including 4-chloro-4-deoxy-galactose, 1,6-dichloro-1,6-dideoxy-fructose and 1,6-dichlorofructose, none of which has ever specifically been tested in terms of safety for human ingestion.
so, if the manufacturer claims that the dose was equivalent to 50 diet sodas, then the tdi would be one-half (1/2) of a diet soda, and even that dose may or may not be safe.
children who regularly consume sugar alcohols also seem to have an increased incidence of childhood obesity.105
the finer point here which is frequently overlooked is that nonspecific extracts of fos will provide nourishment for friendly bacteria (lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, etc.) and pathogenic bacteria (e. coli, salmonella, staphylococcus, clostridium, etc.)
phenylalanine decomposes into diketopiperazine (dkp) a known carcinogen, when exposed to warm temperatures or prolonged storage.
"1 while one might justifiably quibble with the ada over its use of the term "nutritive" to describe many highly-refined sweeteners, that is how the diet dictocrats have structured the official terminology.
so it seems that tagatose only occurs "in nature" to the same extent that heat-treated dairy products occur "in nature."
sunrider, which had recently began marketing a stevioside sweetening product called trusweet, was informed of a trademark infringement complaint filed by the nutrasweet company against their product.
this may be why consumption of tagatose in large amounts reportedly causes gastrointestinal distress, including diarrhea, nausea and flatulence.
" 21 this dismissal of phenylalanine and aspartic acid as significant health hazards is a dangerous bit of sleight of hand.
after experimentally hydrogenating a particular citrus phenolic glycoside, they observed that the resultant compound was very sweet, 1500 to 1800 times sweeter than sucrose.
"20 supporters of aspartame claim that the levels of methanol are not high enough to be worrisome and that phenylalanine and aspartic acid are of only limited concern.
glycerine (which is technically known as a trihydric alcohol) definitely deserves to be included in the macronutrient arena, even though it defies clear categorization.
(stevioside, the most commonly-used extractive of stevia, is about 300 times sweeter than sucrose.)120 stevia leaves and stevioside are virtually calorie-free, beneficial in the prevention of cavities and do not trigger a rise in blood sugar.
after the us cyclamate ban, would-be producers were legally obligated to prove its safety to the fda’s satisfaction if it was to be re-approved.
. be categorized as sugar replacers because they can replace sugar sweeteners, usually on a one-to-one basis; offer less energy; and offer potential health benefits, such as reduced glycemic response and reduced dental caries risk.
consumption of saccharin by these sensitive individuals may result in pruritus (itching), urticaria (blotchy skin discolorations), eczema, photosensitivity, prurigo (a condition characterized by small, intensely itchy skin bumps), wheezing, nausea, diarrhea, tongue blisters, tachycardia, fixed eruptions, headache, diuresis (increased urination) or sensory neuropathy.47 also, regardless of sulfa allergies, consumption of saccharin-sweetened infant formula has been associated with irritability, hypertonia (abnormal increase in muscle tension with reduced muscle elasticity), insomnia, opisthotonos (an abnormal posturing condition characterized by rigidity and severe arching of the back) and strabismus (a condition in which the eyes uncontrollably deviate from the intended object of focus).
the burden of proving that such synthetic compounds are safe, from the process of their creation through the human digestive system and into our environment, should fall upon the purveyors of these chemicals.
"1 while one might justifiably quibble with the ada over its use of the term "nutritive" to describe many highly-refined sweeteners, that is how the diet dictocrats have structured the official terminology.
any adverse reaction to a food item that is regulated under the fda’s authority is supposed to be reported back to their adverse reaction monitoring system (arms).
glycerine glycerine (also spelled as glycerin or called glycerol) takes the prize as the most versatile and vexatious substance in our discussion.
since no specific monitoring practices or epidemiological studies of acesulfame-k are currently in progress, it is possible that relevant data may not be gathered for some time.
he may be contacted at yogaspectrum (at) yahoo.com .
try to seek out glycerine available from a product line which is trustworthy--frontier natural products is one reliable source, available on the internet at www.frontiercoop.com/shop/merchant.mvc (search under the "glycerin" spelling).
sugar alcohols are not broken down in the stomach, so they make their way intact into the bowels.
when aspartame is digested it breaks down into the amino acids phenylalanine and aspartic acid, plus methanol.
thaumatin is metabolized by the human body similarly as other proteins.
according to the splenda website, "sucralose, is made from sugar through a patented, multi-step process that selectively replaces three hydrogen-oxygen groups on the sugar molecule with three chlorine atoms.
the fda said that they needed more specific and scientific information, so the herbal research foundation did extensive scientific research to address specific fda concerns.
according to dr. lydon, "phenylalanine and aspartic acid are amino acids that are normally supplied by the foods we eat; however, they can only be considered natural and harmless when consumed in combination with other amino acids.
indeed, the fda showed very little interest in saccharin until 1969, when researchers discovered that cyclamate was carcinogenic in laboratory mice.
although soft drinks account for more than 70 percent of aspartame consumption, this sweetener is added to more than 6,000 foods, personal care products, and pharmaceuticals.
only about 20 percent of ingested tagatose is absorbed, this taking place by means of metabolism in the small intestine.106 tagatose manufacturers have presented their product as a virtual panacea, claiming that it promotes weight loss, is safe for diabetics, shows potential as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of type ii diabetes, reduces "spiking" of blood glucose levels, fights plaque and halitosis, is a prebiotic (provides food for healthy intestinal bacteria), fights colon cancer, combats certain types of pathogenic bacteria and microorganisms, and raises blood levels of the "good" hdl-cholesterol.
in 1977, canadian scientists found that high doses of saccharin seemed to cause cancer in laboratory rats.
while sugar alcohols may indeed occur in nature, their usage as sweeteners also suffers from the same problem as many other sweeteners, pharmaceutical drugs and other substances today--one single factor from a natural food item is being isolated from its normal co-constituents and consumed at levels that are difficult to obtain when eating the food item itself.
lo han kuo lo han kuo (sometimes spelled lo han guo) is a sweet chinese fruit in the cucumber, melon, squash, and gourd family which has the potential to be as good of a natural option as stevia.
they chose it due to the fact that thaumatin molecules have a very unusual crystalline structure, suitable to the research that nasa was doing at the time.)114 immediately grasping upon the potential of this newly-identified sweetener, the british sugar multinational tate & lyle established massive katemfe plantations in ghana, liberia and malaysia in the 1970s.
they are not only safe for diabetics and hypoglycemics, but in some countries stevia leaves are even prescribed as a medicinal substance for these conditions because they normalize pancreatic function and thus aid in the metabolism of sugar.121 the whole stevia leaves contain a number of beneficial compounds, including ascorbic acid, calcium, beta-carotene, chromium, cobalt, iron, magnesium, manganese, niacin, phosphorus, potassium, riboflavin, selenium, silicon, sodium, thiamin, tin and zinc.122 (it should be noted that only the whole stevia leaves have nutritive benefits.
saccharin was discovered in 1879 by constantine fahlberg, a chemistry research assistant working in the laboratory of professor ira remsen at johns hopkins university.29 according to fahlberg’s account, he accidentally spilled some laboratory material on his hand and noticed the sweet taste later in the evening when he was eating dinner.
even though this was not full fda approval, to quote splenda’s own website, the product was "approved for use in 15 food and beverage categories, the broadest initial approval ever given to a no-calorie sweetener."
apologists for non-nutritive sweeteners point to this as a way of dismissing negative test data.
the sweetness of these purified substances varies between 50 to 450 times that of sucrose.
prebiotics, like probiotics (such as live-culture yogurt--substances which actually contain the same bacteria which are the beneficial flora in the human digestive tract), help promote regularity, prevent yeast overgrowth and are beneficial for those with crohn’s disease, colitis or who are on kidney dialysis.
magnasweet is currently only available to the food processing industry.
as is also the case with stevia, the human digestive system is unable to break down the sweet compounds within lo han fruit.
this appears to be the only safety issue with trehalose.
(of course it is also helpful for the compounds to be dirt cheap to produce in bulk.)
to quote from dr. joseph mercola’s website ( www.mercola.com/2000/dec/3/sucralose_dangers.htm): "although sucralose is being flushed down toilets [after human excretion]. . .
modern scientific research has shown that lo han extracts help relieve gastritis, constipation and respiratory inflammations, and they also appear to inhibit the epstein-barr virus and display anti-carcinogenic properties.148 while the fda has not made any conclusive rulings upon the status of lo han and its extractives, they are currently available to u.s. consumers and have not been opposed in any way by regulatory authorities.
at cold temperatures, methanol will spontaneously give rise to a colorless toxin known as formaldehyde.
the direct result of this chain of events is the severe stomach cramping and diarrhea that many people experience after ingesting too much sugar alcohol.
lo han kuo (sometimes spelled lo han guo) is a sweet chinese fruit in the cucumber, melon, squash, and gourd family which has the potential to be as good of a natural option as stevia.
also, there has been talk of growing canadian stevia as a cash crop, possibly even replacing canadian tobacco.137 to summarize, while we will all have to wait to see what the future holds for stevia, we should not wait to begin using it and reaping its benefits.
therefore, an excessive load (e.g., greater than 50 g sorbitol per day, greater than 20 g mannitol per day) may cause diarrhea. . . .
the fda also admits that aspartic acid has the potential to cause brain damage at very high doses, but they assure us that "under normal intake levels, the brain’s mechanism for controlling aspartic acid levels ensures no adverse effects.
the company responded by formally petitioning for stevia’s gras status and presenting the fda with substantial evidence that stevia had a long history of safe usage.
by varying this manufacturing process, different end products may be created to meet different requirements of the food processing industry.
stevioside extracts merely function as a sweetener and pass through the body undigested, although they do possess anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties.)123 when applied topically, the stevia leaves also fight acne and speed wound healing while also reducing the formation of scar tissue.124
research conducted with rats, mice and rabbits has shown that sucralose consumption can cause shrinking of the thymus gland (up to 40 percent shrinkage), enlargement of the liver and kidneys, atrophy of lymph follicles in the spleen and thymus, increased cecal weight, reduced bodily growth rate, decreased red blood cell count, hyperplasia of the pelvis, extension of gestational periods in pregnancy, decreased fetal body weights and placental weights, and diarrhea.
products with sorbitol and mannitol may have the following statement on the label because high intakes increase the risk of malabsorption: ‘excess consumption may have a laxative effect.
jim may, founder and president of the company, had even gone so far as to submit test samples of stevia to the fda to assure that it would be okay to use it in the company’s products.
we will all see soon enough how neotame is received by the public.80,81,82 as a concluding remark on all five of the fda-approved non-nutritive sweeteners, it should be noted that many animal studies on these products only yield negative results when test animals are fed the equivalent of several hundred artificially sweetened products daily.
it is also used in other countries in sweetener blends, chewing gums, vitamin tablets, baked goods, dairy products and pharmaceuticals.117 while talin is not commercially available to the average consumer in this country, it is possible to order the dried, unprocessed fruit of the katemfe plant online atwww.bouncingb.com/thaumatococcus_danielli.php .

while the author could not find any information commenting on this fact, the use of a hydrogenation process may or may not be of concern.
the study documented only very scant information about the quantities of stevia which the mice consumed and how it was prepared.
by 1902, his new product was causing nervousness in the german sugar industry.
spanish conquistadors of the sixteenth century learned about stevia from the local guarani and mato grosso societies, who used it to sweeten teas and herbal medicines.
some of the end products do not contain a specific sugar alcohol in any clear majority; these are simply referred to by the generalized term--hydrogenated starch hydrolysate.
the company responded by formally petitioning for stevia’s gras status and presenting the fda with substantial evidence that stevia had a long history of safe usage.
even though this was not full fda approval, to quote splenda’s own website, the product was "approved for use in 15 food and beverage categories, the broadest initial approval ever given to a no-calorie sweetener."

64 sucralose may have the strangest "accidental discovery" story of all.
a case may certainly be made that lo han should be allowed as a gras substance due to its substantial history of safe usage prior to 1958.
the fda said that they needed more specific and scientific information, so the herbal research foundation did extensive scientific research to address specific fda concerns.
thus, consumption of fos may help to shorten fecal transit time, increase fecal bulk and reduces constipation.
additional concerns with sugar alcohols stem from the fact that they seem to increase the frequency of seizures in epileptics, and children are especially sensitive to the gastrointestinal side effects, possibly due to their propensity for bingeing on sweet foods.

under that law, stevia was cleared for import into the u.s., providing that it only be labeled and used as a dietary supplement and not as a sweetener.136 this allows u.s. companies to use and sell stevia, but only by walking the narrow line of not implicating it in any way as a sweetener.
sucralose is also said to be diabetic-safe, as it does not increase blood sugar levels.
any one of them just may turn up on a product label one day, and having some knowledge of what a substance is may help each of us to make informed purchases.
to deal with this category, we must first rid ourselves of the silly idea that the word "nutritive" necessarily indicates that a substance will contribute anything positive to our general well being.
notwithstanding the baseless nature of this complaint, sunrider knew that they did not have the economic resources to fight a legal battle with nutrasweet.
the difference is virtually irrelevant to your tongue, but the digestive system has no idea how to handle this unnatural molecule, just as the body cannot properly assimilate many synthetic vitamins, which are mirror images of their natural counterparts.
