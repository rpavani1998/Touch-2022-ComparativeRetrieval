i want to lose some weight (go from 210 to 190) by eliminating my refined sugar intake and reducing my fruit intake to those with low levels of natural sugar eg. berries.i don’t eat much refined sugar, and don’t keep it in my house, but i sweeten tea, granola, yogurt, and toast with way too much honey or maple syrup, so hopefully a purge will help me cut back in the long run.i have significantly reduced the amount of sweets i eat over the past few months anyway, but am continuously horrified to find sugar or corn syrup in all kinds of foods where it doesn’t belong.we do use honey, agave, and pure maple syrup in treats and on our occasional pancake nights.i don’t actually consume many added sugars — and most would be very easy for me to cut out, as they’re generally just a little added treat anyway.the only type they should stay away from is truvia because it is mixed with an artificial sweetener.i personally struggled to lose weight after my first baby and believe i eventually got into the best shape of my life after baby’s 2, 3 and 4 (still on my journey since #4 is only 6 months old) by cutting out sugars on a daily basis, period.we don’t add sweeteners to anything but there are some recipes that we cook that use them.there’s added sugar in just about all of them, even the “healthiest” ones.in the 10 ways to sweeten without sugar, it suggests using applesauce in place of sugar, however i know it can also be used in place of oil.and then at the grocery store they sell product after product, even savory items like bread and crackers, that can’t make it on the shelves without being sweetened.i’ve done a great job in cutting white sugar and artificial sweeteners from my diet.it is amazing where sweeteners natural & unnatural are hidden in our lives.but don’t feel discouraged because even if you only join us for a day or two, i promise it will still be an eye-opening experience proving just how sugar-obsessed our society really is.so after a little mental struggle on if i should or shouldn’t “roll the dice” by leaving out the sweetener all together i decided to add extra cinnamon just in case it could help make up for the loss of honey.
