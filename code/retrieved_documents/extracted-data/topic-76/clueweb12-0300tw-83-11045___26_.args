too much sugar can deplete levels of serotonin, the neurotransmitter whose deficiency is linked to depression.long-term sugar intolerance leads to type 2 diabetes and other complications like obesity and inflammation.excess sugar consumption also upsets the balance of intestinal flora in your digestive tract and can cause symptoms of intestinal distress such as bloating, cramping, and gas.this is important because for tens of millions of women, their diet soda or artificially-sweetened food is a keystone of what they think are healthy nutrition and food choices — both for themselves and for their families.recent studies in europe show that aspartame use can result in an accumulation of formaldehyde in the brain, which can damage your central nervous system and immune system and cause genetic trauma.while most polyalcohol sugars have no side effects, sorbitol is a natural laxative and can cause diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, bloating and flatulence.eating sugar shoots our blood sugar levels up and triggers a spike in the hormone insulin, which is needed to prep our cells to absorb the sugar.artificial sweeteners can be just as troublesome, with one exception: sugar addiction — those of us who simply cannot stop eating sugar once we start.most researchers agree that in sufficient doses, saccharin is carcinogenic in humans.the manufacturer’s own short-term studies showed that very high doses of sucralose (far beyond what would be expected in an ordinary diet) caused shrunken thymus glands, enlarged livers, and kidney disorders in rodents.women tend to notice this more during perimenopause, when excess sugar and other simple carbohydrates triggersymptoms of hormonal imbalance.they are never a good idea for pregnant women, children or teenagers — despite the reduced sugar content — because of possible irreversible cell damage.as food additives, artificial sweeteners are not subject to the same gauntlet of fda safety trials as pharmaceuticals.in my practice i’ve seen that many patients are better able to break their addiction to sugar and maintain weight loss with the help of sugar substitutes.sucralose has been implicated as a possible migraine trigger, for example.
