but they contend that the impact of those innovations upon the reported incidence of these central nervous system (cns) tumors had fully worked their way through before aspartame was introduced.
(searle is not obligated to monitor any adverse reactions.)
their second main finding is that there has also been a marked change in the incidence of particular types of brain tumors, with a reduction in the proportion of a relatively unaggressive (and often preliminary) type of tumor (astrocytomas) and a sharp increase in the incidence of a far more aggressive (and all too often terminal) type of tumor (glioblastomas).
firstly, the type of cns tumor found to be increasing most rapidly in the usa is the same kind of lesion as was found in one of the animal studies conducted on aspartame in the 1970s.(3)

before these imaging technologies were introduced, it was far harder to diagnose brain cancer.
both the public board of inquiry and the fda staff scientists were, however, over-ruled by the incoming fda commissioner, arthur hull hayes, who asserted that the brain cancer risk was minimal and that further research was not necessary.

scientists were, however, over-ruled by the incoming fda commissioner, arthur hull hayes, who asserted that the brain cancer risk was minimal and that further research was not necessary.
they reported that the nitrosated aspartame had significant mutagenic action.
the symptoms reported include headaches and blurred vision at the most mild through to epileptic-type seizures at the most severe.
but they contend that the impact of those innovations upon the reported incidence of these central nervous system (cns) tumors had fully worked their way through before aspartame was introduced.
consequently, it was often not until tumors developed into glioblastomas that they were diagnosed, and a relatively high portion of tumors at the earlier astrocytoma stage went undetected.
it has been found that methanol (free-form wood alcohol) can race through the system of a highly fit individual due to their high metabolic rate.
that implies that, in aggregate, artificial sweeteners are not acting as sugar substitutes but merely as supplements to sugar consumption.

drinking between 1-3 12 ounce cans or glasses of diet beverage that contains aspartame on a hot day after exercise can expose you to 8 times the environmental protection agency’s recommended safe limit for methanol.
the introduction and rapid diffusion of computerized tomography in the early to mid- 1970s, and of magnetic resonance imaging technology in the early to mid-1980s, certainly improved diagnostic precision.
it is, moreover, one of the most successful synthetic chemicals every produced.
the investigators argue, moreover, that the reported changes in tumor incidence were unlikely to have been artifacts of improvements in diagnostic technologies.
an fda task force showed, for example, that in one particular study it was impossible to identify the occasion on which a particular animals had died.
the public are entitled to be sure, in particular, that none of the experts advising the authorities are acting as paid consultants to the companies which either manufacture or utilize artificial sweeteners.
anecdotal evidence suggests that a larger proportion of 50 to 70 year old americans consume aspartame-sweetened products than is the case in the uk or in other european countries.
on the contrary, the bulk of the available evidence suggests that in relation to attempted weight loss, artificial sweeteners are at best ineffective and at worst counter-productive.
aerobic instructors and other fitness participants that consume diet beverages after exercise are at risk for absorbing high levels of methanol.
they found that the introduction of aspartame into the usa, into dry goods in 1981 and soft drinks in 1983, was followed by an abrupt increase (of approximately 10%) in the reported incidence of brain tumors.
aspartame removes the essential mineral chromium from the body, which is necessary in regulating the clearance of glucose from the blood while assisting insulin’ s capability for glucose regulation.
just about any food that once had sugar as an ingredient now can have aspartame instead.
there is no safe level of aspartame since it was originally classified by the department of defense as a neuro-excitatory toxin, and it is a cumulative effect in the body.

actually the increased intake of aspartame over the past twenty-five years since it’s fda approval are correlated with higher intake of sugar (over 150 pounds per year) and associated states of degenerative diseases that rack our country.

phenylalanine, for example, lowers or blocks production of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which sends messages from the pineal gland in the brain.
if the apparent increase in overall incidence had been due to improved diagnostics, then we should expect a marked change in post- diagnostic survival rates, but no such change was evident.
one died after 300 days of (aspartame) from here on referred to as “asp”, and five others had grand mal seizures.
exposures to those potential hazards are, furthermore, occupational linked and it is hard to see how they could explain why males and females seem to be equally affected.
that has proved difficult because while aggregate brain cancer statistics are readily available, information on tumors types is hard to obtain.

there is, in particular, evidence that artificial sweeteners are appetite stimulants, and while a particular mouthful of artificially sweetened food or drink may contain fewer calories than their sugar-sweetened analogues, the consumption of artificial sweeteners may provoke people into going on, what might be termed, ‘a calorie hunt’.
when the imaging technologies were introduced, brain tumors tended to be detected at the earlier stage, and consequently in the late 1970s the number of reported astrocytomas went up, while the number of glioblastomas exhibited a corresponding decline.
that evidence may be important because it suggests not only a mechanism through which aspartame could exert a possible carcinogenic action, but also why the interval between the compound’s introduction and the elevation of brain cancer rates appears to have been so brief.
