we suspect that eating zero-calorie sweeteners "prime" the body to look for the calories it thinks should accompany the consumption of sweets ... and that, when it doesn't find them, the cravings begin.there's good evidence the body handles hfcs differently than it does sugar, andmore and more articles are warning about its ill-effects.though we had no health issues associated with gulping down splenda -- in diet cokes, in diet rite drinks, in tea and coffee, in pre-packaged foods -- we elected to reduce (and eventually eliminate) sucralose from our diet, too.sodas are expensive, sweetened water, and you can drink a lot of tea for the price of a can of coke.when we do have something sweet, we have less of it ... because real sugar satisfies us in a way that artificial sweeteners and hfcs cannot.hfcs is super-sweet and super-cheap, which is why almost all soft drink manufacturers have switched to it from sugar.with our palettes unsullied by a constant barrage of sweet, sweet, sweetness, we're noticing more complex flavors in our food: the nutty taste of teas, the subtle cinnamon note in coffee, the touch of citrus in fresh vegetables.you'll have to look for more organic products and avoid more pre-packaged foods.instead of dumping splenda into our coffee, we're using just a touch of raw, unrefined sugar.but it's also in everything from health drinks to so-called "100 percent natural fruit juices."i'm a guy who makes his living by finding just the right words at just the right time, and i had noticed that, as my consumption of diet coke and nutrasweet increased, my bouts ofaphasia -- the inability to recall a desired word -- had also increased in their frequency and severity.that fast, dramatic difference made us wonder about the impact of the other artificial sweeteners we were consuming.the primary impact of this change has been financial: diet cokes and other sodas have dropped from our shopping list.we find that sugar regulates itself.real food tastes better.
