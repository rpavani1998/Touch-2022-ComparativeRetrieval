sugar is a great flavour enhancer.
it's not as sweet as the sugar syrup.
you can add the sugar directly, but because sugar is more soluble in water than in alcohol, it's usually better to make a simplesugar syrup... ...and add it to your infusion little by little.

another option is glucose syrup.
true danish flavoured schnapps should not contain more than 15 grams sugar per liter.
however, you can substitute white sugar for other sweeteners such as fruit sugars, brown sugar, cane sugar, a mix of different sugars, corn syrup, or honey.
also, if your infusion is too weak-flavoured you can certainly enhance the flavours by adding a little, little bit of sugar.
