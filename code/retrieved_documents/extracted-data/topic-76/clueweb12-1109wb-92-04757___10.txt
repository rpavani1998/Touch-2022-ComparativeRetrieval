high fructose corn syrup is used to sweeten lots of foods: - regular soft drinks - fruit drinks, such as fruitades and fruit punch - candy and gum - grain products, such as cakes, cookies, crackers, pies, and sweet rolls - cereals - canned fruits - milk-based desserts and products, such as ice cream, sweetened yogurt and sweetened milk - jams, jellies, and peanut butter - condiments, such as ketchup, mayonnaise, salad dressings (particularly low-fat)
whether or not artificial sweeteners are “safe” for our health, why consume an artificial product when a natural one if available?

she and co-authors conclude that possible mercury contamination of food chemicals like hfcs was not common knowledge within the food industry that frequently uses the sweetener.
these are the main ingredients of packaged, processed foods in america.
when do we admit that there is a correlation between the toxins we’ve  released into our environment, what we eat and drink, what medicines we take  and our overall health?
there are more questions than answers.
a separate study by the us institute for agriculture and trade policy (iatp) claims mercury was detected in nearly one-third of 55 brand name food and beverage products where hfcs is the first or second highest labeled ingredient, including, it claims, products by quaker, hershey’s, kraft and smucker’s.

fructose propels the liver into fat-promoting mode by activating the formation of enymes that lead to elevated levels of “bad” cholesterol and triglycerides.

of course there’s the problems associated with excessive drinking.
it turns up in some unlikely places, such as pizza, bread, hot dogs, boxed rice mixes, soup, crackers, spaghetti sauce, lunch meat, canned vegetables, fruit drinks, flavored yogurt, ketchup, salad dressing, mayonnaise, and some peanut butter.

if the ingredient list contains the words “shortening”, “partially hydrogenated vegetable oil” or “hydrogenated vegetable oil”, then the food contains trans fat.
the problem with hfcs is that the body handles fructose differently than all other sugars.
i cannot imagine how his parents coped.
pigs will scavenge and have been known to eat any kind of food, including dead insects, worms, tree bark, rotting carcasses, garbage, and even other pigs.

health authorities recommend that consumption of trans fat be reduced to trace amounts.

in making hfcs, caustic soda is used, among other things, to separate corn starch from the corn kernel.
the consumption of trans fats increases one’s risk ofcoronary heart disease by raising levels of “bad” ldl cholesterol and lowering levels of “good” hdl cholesterol.

the battle rages on about the presence of mercury in high fructose corn syrup (hfcs)… according to an article published in the journal, environmental health journal, mercury was found in nearly 50 per cent of tested samples of commercial high fructose corn syrup (hfcs).

even without the possibility of mercury contamination, i avoid it like the plague and have for years.
the pervasiveness of hfcs in prepared food products quite possibly means that exposure to mercury is greater for folks who eat those products on a daily basis.
when do we admit that there is a correlation between the toxins we’ve released into our environment, what we eat and drink, what medicines we take and our overall health?
the next time you go to the grocers, look at the list of ingredients.

the use of mercury cells to produce caustic soda can contaminate caustic soda, and ultimately hfcs, with mercury.

the presence of these diseases and parasites is one of the reasons why pork meat should always be well cooked or cured before eating.
in the same time period, the increases in sugar & sweeteners, vegetable oils, and cereal grains are dramatic.
- high-fructose corn syrup – manufacturers use hfcs because it’s cheap.
hfcs use has skyrocketed in recent decades as the sweetener has replaced sugar in many processed foods.
while the fda had evidence that commercial hfcs was contaminated with mercury four years ago, the agency did not inform consumers, help change industry practice or conduct additional testing.
