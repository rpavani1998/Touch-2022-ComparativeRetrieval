this led researchers to believe that foods with artificial sweeteners, such as saccharin and aspartame, lead to greater weight gain than the same foods sweetened with high-calorie sugar.surprisingly, however, switching from sugar to an artificial, no-calorie sweetener may thwart your attempts to cut calories and actually cause your metabolism to slow down, and slow metabolism can be a major factor in weight gain.how they work artificial sweeteners may weaken the body’s ability to identify the delivery of calories into the stomach.over time, your body loses the ability to gauge caloric intake, which leads to a tendency to consume more food than needed and thereby gain more weight.these excess calories lead to obesity.while the incidence of obesity and overweight americans have spiked over the years, so has the trend of consuming “sugar-free” foods.a recent study by purdue university found that rats given yogurt sweetened with saccharin (an artificial sweetener) consumed more calories and gained more weight than rats fed yogurt sweetened with glucose (a natural variety of sugar).in its natural state it is highly nutritious, since the molasses has not been removed.cane sugar—produced from the sugar cane plant • cane sugar does not go through the same refinery process as sugar, so it retains more of the nutrients.when the sugar is replaced by a no-calorie, artificial sweetener, and the calories never reach the stomach, the body is left in a state of confusion.your brain then prepares your stomach to take in the sugar, while your metabolism prepares the body for the incoming calories.honey—produced by honeybees • contains a number of nutrients that include sugars, such as fructose, glucose, sucrose, maltose, lactose and other disaccharides and trisaccharides.table sugar (sucrose)—white table sugar is empty of all vitamins, minerals, fiber, amino acids and trace elements, which are removed during the refining process.switching to natural sweeteners: replacing artificially processed sugars with natural sweeteners is the best solution, so consider adding one or more of the below to your diet: stevia —extracted from a plant grown in south america • does not raise blood sugar levels.agave nectar—juice is extracted from the core of the agave plant • has minimal effect on blood sugar and insulin release.
