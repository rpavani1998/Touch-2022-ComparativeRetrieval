in addition to weight control, alternative sweeteners can be useful for people withdiabetes.because stevia has anegligible effect on blood sugar it is popular with people on a low-carbohydrate diet.but for people who eat emotionally, artificial sweeteners can give them the space to deal with the reasons why they overeat before having to cope with a dramatically changed diet.”they provide virtually no calories and the same sweetness as sugar for much smaller volumes.these provide the base for many diet food products, such as low-calorie yoghurts, desserts, soft drinks, biscuits and diet jellies.lawler, who is also an exercise physiologist, said that some sugar immediately after a training session can improve muscle recovery.you may find that some low-calorie products using artificial sweeteners have a different mouth feel to their sugared counterpart, or an aftertaste.they tend not to raise blood-sugar levels because they are not carbohydrate.your teeth will thank you for making the switch too, because artificial sweeteners don’t contribute to tooth decay like sugar does.“if somebody has a lot of sugar in their diet and loves sweet food, they might still want to consume it while losing weight.there’s no research to suggest that sweeteners can reduce athletic performance butif you are doing a lot of cardio work you shouldn’t need to worry about eating some sugar.one common mistake is that slimmers sometimes think they can eat as much of a diet, sugar-free version of a product as they like and forget about the other nutrients.in that case it can be a simple process of swapping over to diet versions of their favourite foods, creating a calorie deficit and losing weight.”whether you choose table sugar, natural sweeteners or the artificial variety, don’t forget to include them in youronline diary to help you control your energy equation and nutrient profile.substituting your soft drink for the diet version or choosing a sweetener instead of sugar feels a little more civilised.
