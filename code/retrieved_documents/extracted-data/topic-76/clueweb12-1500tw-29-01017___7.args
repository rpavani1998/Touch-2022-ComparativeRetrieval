for a while, the pancreas can handle this workload; however, over time it becomes exhausted and unable to efficiently release insulin any longer.
another type of simple sugar is glucose, which is the most common form of carbohydrate.
the insulin binds to the glucose and carries it to the cells that need extra energy, storing any remaining energy in long-term storage (a.k.a. fat cells).
concentrated fructose in hfcs, agave, and crystallized fructose on the other hand, can cause a real health problem and should be avoided.
o health and beauty- which is very high in fructose (up to 97% fructose).
if people continued to eat fructose only in fruit and occasionally honey as our ancestors did, the body would easily process it without any problems.

likewise, fructose has a low glycemic index, meaning it has minimal impact on blood glucose levels.
for liquid sweetener needs, raw coconut nectar is great as it is only 10% fructose (compared to agave, which is up to 97% fructose) and is rich in minerals in amino acids.
at the same time, because insulin release is now inefficient, glucose is no longer being delivered to the cells that need it, resulting in cell starvation.

the problem with fructose is that when you consume large amounts of it in its concentrated form (agave, crystalline fructose, high-fructose corn syrup), it goes straight to your liver, avoiding the gastrointestinal tract altogether.
this can result in the chronically elevated blood glucose levels found in type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome.
it occurs naturally in fresh fruits, giving them their sweetness.
i sincerely hope that this information (please help spread it!) makes more people aware of the differences in sugar types, and makes more people know to avoid agave at all costs.
