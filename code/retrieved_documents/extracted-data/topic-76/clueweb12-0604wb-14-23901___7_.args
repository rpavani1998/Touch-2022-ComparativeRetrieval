artificially-sweetened and no-calorie sodas may indeed help consumers lose weight -- if they count calories and burn them through exercise, according to michael jacobson, executive director of the center for science in the public interest(cspi).their research showed that aspartame caused cancer – lymphoma and leukemia -- in laboratory rats.it has not caused cancer or significant other problem in the animal studies that have been conducted.common artificial sweeteners have very little name recognition, the poll found, so parents are unaware of what they’re giving their children.but the risk of illness to humans who consume small amounts of aspartame appears to be minimal.there's no epidemic of new cancers, so the risk is very low if these really do cause cancer.”jacobson said seltzer water, milk, or just plain water are safer and healthier options for drinks.and some of them may actually be harmful, depending on the medical study you believe.for example, according to poll results, acesulfame k, the sweetener that the cspi thinks should be off the market, is virtually unknown to parents.just because a product claims to be from a natural source does not prove that it is safe, according to thecspi.truvia and purevia, brand names of a sweet substance derived from the stevia plant, are too new on the market and inadequately studied, said jacobson.“sales of sugar have been steady.as for concerns about calories, hayes explains that a true teaspoon of sugar – not a heaping one -- has just fifteen calories that are easily burned off in sixteen minutes of sleep.that’s welcome news to pinckert, who said she eats fewer sweet foods throughout the day thanks to her splenda-saturated coffee.an incurable sweet-tooth, pinckert wanted to trade out real sugar, especially because her taste buds demanded so much of it.
