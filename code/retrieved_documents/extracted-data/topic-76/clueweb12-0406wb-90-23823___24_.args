on the contrary, the bulk of the available evidence suggests that in relation to attempted weight loss, artificial sweeteners are at best ineffective and at worst counter-productive.aspartame removes the essential mineral chromium from the body, which is necessary in regulating the clearance of glucose from the blood while assisting insulin’ s capability for glucose regulation.there is, in particular, evidence that artificial sweeteners are appetite stimulants, and while a particular mouthful of artificially sweetened food or drink may contain fewer calories than their sugar-sweetened analogues, the consumption of artificial sweeteners may provoke people into going on, what might be termed, ‘a calorie hunt’.there is however no reliable evidence to indicate that artificial sweeteners actually help people loose weight.actually the increased intake of aspartame over the past twenty-five years since it’s fda approval are correlated with higher intake of sugar (over 150 pounds per year) and associated states of degenerative diseases that rack our country.there is no safe level of aspartame since it was originally classified by the department of defense as a neuro-excitatory toxin, and it is a cumulative effect in the body.it has been found that methanol (free-form wood alcohol) can race through the system of a highly fit individual due to their high metabolic rate.anecdotal evidence suggests that a larger proportion of 50 to 70 year old americans consume aspartame-sweetened products than is the case in the uk or in other european countries.that evidence may be important because it suggests not only a mechanism through which aspartame could exert a possible carcinogenic action, but also why the interval between the compound’s introduction and the elevation of brain cancer rates appears to have been so brief.many of the products containing artificial sweeteners are labeled as ‘diet’ products implying that consuming artificially sweetened products helps people to control or even to reduce their weight.they found that the introduction of aspartame into the usa, into dry goods in 1981 and soft drinks in 1983, was followed by an abrupt increase (of approximately 10%) in the reported incidence of brain tumors.their second main finding is that there has also been a marked change in the incidence of particular types of brain tumors, with a reduction in the proportion of a relatively unaggressive (and often preliminary) type of tumor (astrocytomas) and a sharp increase in the incidence of a far more aggressive (and all too often terminal) type of tumor (glioblastomas).aerobic instructors and other fitness participants that consume diet beverages after exercise are at risk for absorbing high levels of methanol.sudden weight gains, water retention and flu like symptoms have been observed in fitness people, especially in aerobic instructors.that implies that, in aggregate, artificial sweeteners are not acting as sugar substitutes but merely as supplements to sugar consumption.
