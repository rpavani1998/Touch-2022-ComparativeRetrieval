in addition to its intoxicating qualities, alcohol can be used as a preservative and to sterilize medical equipment and wounds.xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, the sweet alcohols, are roughly as sweet as sugar and are useful both to sweeten food for diabetics and potentially as a tooth decay preventative.as many artificial sweeteners (notably neotame, aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose) are sweeter by volume than sugar, and store reasonably well, they may be easier trade goods than sugar itself.stevia is more promising because of its ability to grow as a houseplant, and could be an excellent target for cooperative extension projects and local nursery development.sugar is also very important in preserving food, where it creates a hostile environment for bacteria as well as a delicious treat.corn sweeteners corn-based sweeteners thrive today because of a combination of the import quotas noted above and subsidies for corn production.corn-based sweeteners thrive today because of a combination of the import quotas noted above and subsidies for corn production.however, it may prove useful as a household-scale sweetener, especially for people who have difficulties with other sweeteners.some farmers are experimenting with it in tompkins county as a cover crop and animal feed today, and it may be an appealing option if climate change extends the growing season.cane sugar's long history, however, suggests that it and its by-product molasses can still be valuable with reduced processing, as extracting sugar is relatively simple and can be fueled with the cane that created it[1].while whole fruits are, of course, a delicious way to enjoy fruits, juicing and similar processes make it much easier for people to consume fruits that are bruised, damaged, or simply useful as a background sweetener rather than as the primary flavor.competition between food and energy uses of sugar will likely increase demand (and prices) for sweeteners.even in less extreme cases, sweeteners can certainly add enjoyment to foods otherwise too bitter or too bland to be attractive.all of the natural sweeteners except stevia can be converted into alcohol through fermentation, possibly followed by more energy-intensive distillation.rain and snow can keep bees in their hives and prevent their collecting food, while drought can delay or hinder plants from flowering.
