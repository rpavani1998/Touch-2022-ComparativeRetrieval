excess amounts of this sweetener can contribute to high blood sugar, obesity, and have other unhealthy effects on the human body, it would seem likely that substituting stevia for sugar could have a positive effect on longevity.since stevia can substitute for sugar, and we know excess amounts of this sweetener can contribute to high blood sugar, obesity, and have other unhealthy effects on the human body, it would seem likely that substituting stevia for sugar could have a positive effect on longevity.this study shows that oral stevia is a well tolerated and effective modality that may be considered as an alternative or supplementary therapy for patients with hypertension.in our opinion, having reviewed all the safety studies published thus far, and considering the safe, centuries-old consumption in south america, and the two decades-plus use of stevia by japanese consumers, we conclude that stevia is safe for human consumption, particularly in the dosages normally consumed as a partial alternative to sugar, other natural sweeteners, and artificial sweeteners.this is a positive indication that stevia can potentially be beneficial to diabetics who substitute stevia in order to decrease their sugar consumption.stevioside reduces postprandial blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetic patients, indicating beneficial effects on the glucose metabolism.in other words, avoiding high sugar consumption, and high caloric consumption, could theoretically, over the years and decades, help our proteins stay healthier.it's also quite possible that artificial sweeteners may be safe in low amounts, but problems could arise when they are used in excessive quantities.i evaluated in detail all the published studies on stevia over the past few decades, and based on a thorough evaluation, i am confident to say that stevia, in my opinion, is safe and quite likely significantly safer than some of the artificial sweeteners currently on the market.this study shows that oral steviol glycosides, taken as sweetener are well tolerated and have no pharmacological effect.they could now enjoy a sweet taste and avoid the harmful consequences of excessive sugar intake.i am not concerned with stevia causing any medical conditions, in fact, from all the studies that i have reviewed, it is a very safe supplement and most likely much, much safer than many artificial sweeteners.those who have a predisposition to diabetes will have a marked rise in blood sugar levels.the herbal sweetener is heat stable and thus could be used for cooking and baking.it is an appropriate sweetener for many types of foods since it is stable in acid foods (like tomato, pineapple, and limes).
