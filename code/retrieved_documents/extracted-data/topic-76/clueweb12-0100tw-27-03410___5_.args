adding a limited amount of sugar to improve the taste of foods (especially for children) that provide important nutrients, such as whole-grain cereal, low-fat milk or yogurt, is better than eating nutrient-poor, highly sweetened foods.reducing the amount of added sugars we eat cuts calories and can help you improve your heart health and control your weight.added sugars contribute additional calories and zero nutrients to food.added sugars (or added sweeteners) can include natural sugars such as white sugar, brown sugar and honey as well as other caloric sweeteners that are chemically manufactured (such as high fructose corn syrup).in a daily calorie budget, the essentials are the minimum number of calories you need to meet your nutrient needs.any product that contains milk (such as yogurt, milk or cream) or fruit (fresh, dried) contains somenatural sugars.although sugars are not harmful to the body, our bodies don’tneed sugars to function properly.naturally occurring sugars are found in milk (lactose) and fruit (fructose).fats are the most concentrated source of calories.a report from the 2001-04 nhanes (national health and nutrition examination survey) database showed that americans get about 22.2 teaspoons of sugar a day or about 355 calories.the u.s. department of agriculture has identified some common foods with added sugars.for most american women, this is no more than 100 calories per day and no more than 150 calories per day for men (or about 6 teaspoons per day for women and 9 teaspoons per day for men).depending on the foods you choose and the amount of physical activity you do each day, you may have calories left over for “extras” that can be used on treats like solid fats, added sugars and alcohol.although you can’t isolate the calories per serving from added sugars with the information on a nutrition label, it may be helpful to calculate the calories per serving fromtotal sugars (added sugars and naturally occurring sugars).reading the ingredient list on a processed food’s label can tell you if the product contains added sugars, just not the exact amount if the product also contains natural sugars.
