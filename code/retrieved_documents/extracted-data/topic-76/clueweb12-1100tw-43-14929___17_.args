aspartame has been shown to cause birth defects, brain tumors and seizures and to contribute to diabetes and emotional disorders.in fact, children are the biggest consumers of nutritionally void junk food at a time when their brains and bodies are growing rapidly and in need of a nutrient-dense diet for proper development, both physically and mentally.some natural sweeteners, such as blackstrap molasses, unprocessed honey, fruit juice, brown rice syrup, and evaporated cane juice do contain low levels of nutrients, such as the b vitamins, and minerals such as iron, calcium and potassium.the neurotoxic effects of these isolated amino acids can be linked to headaches, mental confusion, balance problems and seizures.stevia is an extremely safe herb that is not only an excellent sweetener, but it actually lowers blood sugar levels in diabetics by helping to regulate pancreatic function.as a physician, i have found that reducing sugar intake is one of the most important ways to control hypoglycemia, diabetes, and intestinal yeast.and unlike sugar, which weakens the immune system, stevia has antimicrobial properties and actually helps the body fight off colds and flus.this can result in hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and sugar cravings.drawing on the body's nutrient reserves can also lead to chronic mineral deficits, especially in magnesium (a mineral required for more than 300 different enzyme activities) and chromium (a trace element that regulates hormones such as insulin), putting you at risk for dozens of diseases, from depression to attention deficit disorder to asthma.refined sugar also overworks the pancreas and adrenal glands as they struggle to keep the blood sugar levels in balance.most people do realize that sugar can cause hyperactivity, but what they don't realize is that sugar lurks where you least expect to find it and affects the human body in myriad ways.grains contain b vitamins and magnesium, these nutrients are important co-factors in hundreds of metabolic processes in the body.when these storehouses are depleted, the body becomes unable to properly metabolize fatty acids and cholesterol, leading to higher cholesterol and triglyceride levels.but some things, such as antibiotics and too much sugar in the diet, can cause the yeast to multiply, leading a number of health problems, from vaginal yeast infections to severe fatigue.this puts your pancreas into overdrive, making insulin (which carries glucose to your cells to be used for energy) to normalize blood sugar levels.
