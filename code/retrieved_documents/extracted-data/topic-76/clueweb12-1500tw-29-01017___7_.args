unfortunately, these sweeteners have their own health risks, are artificial chemicals, and are neurotoxic.high triglycerides are linked to increased risk of atherosclerosis and heart disease.artificial sweeteners many people recognize the inherent health risks of sugar and fructose, and thus turn to alternative forms of sweetness.at the same time, because insulin release is now inefficient, glucose is no longer being delivered to the cells that need it, resulting in cell starvation.this can result in the chronically elevated blood glucose levels found in type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome.eating excess levels of starches and simple sugars can break your body’s glucose management mechanism (metabolism), resulting in numerous health problems.likewise, fructose has a low glycemic index, meaning it has minimal impact on blood glucose levels.high fructose intake has been associated with: increased levels of circulating blood lipids obesity increased levels of uric acid (associated with gout and heart disease) liver scarring (cirrhosis)because of this, many people consider fructose “natural,” and assume that all fructose products are healthier than other types of sugar.in order to return your blood sugar to a normal level, the pancreas releases insulin, which is a storage hormone.many people recognize the inherent health risks of sugar and fructose, and thus turn to alternative forms of sweetness.additionally, fructose is converted by the liver into glycerol, which can raise levels of triglycerides.for liquid sweetener needs, raw coconut nectar is great as it is only 10% fructose (compared to agave, which is up to 97% fructose) and is rich in minerals in amino acids.when you eat starches, your body converts them to glucose, which raises blood sugar levels and supplies your body with energy.hyperglycemia over time has been related to: bottom line: your body will cull the glucose it needs from complex carbohydrate-rich foods including vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, and whole grains.
