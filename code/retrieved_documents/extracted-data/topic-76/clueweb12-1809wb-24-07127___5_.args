any chlorinated hydrocarbon in the world is toxic, carcinogenic.the results confirmed that aspartame breaks down in the body to formaldehyde, which breaks up the dna and leaves the body with double-strand breaks, most associated with cancer induction.this addiction makes us crave more and more sweet foods and can actually cause weight gain, rather than weight loss – which is the reason most people use these products anyway.studies also show artificial sweeteners are addictive.it’s sucralose, which is chlorinated hydrocarbon, which is toxic.so far i have believed this is a healthy, natural alternative to sugar or honey, with a lower glycemic index.the green – stevia: stevia is 100% natural, extracted from a plant in south america, it has a low glycemic index and there are no controversial reports on the health or safety of this natural sweetener.one of the big benefits is that it measures just like sugar – making it easier to use in baking.it also contains erythritol – a natural substance found in pears, melons, grapes, mushrooms and wine.my personal opinion: much better choices than artificial sweeteners, but i use them only in moderation to keep my weight and health in check.all cause increases in insulin, our fat storing hormone.this is a pre-biotic soluble fiber – something your body needs anyway.controlling this hormone, so that our food is burned as fuel rather than stored as fat, is a key tenant to my weight loss plan,sexy forever, so i moderate my use of all of these sugars.additionally, there is a small amount of fructose found in our inulin blend, but it’s such a low amount, we still boast 0 sugars per serving.not a good source for baking as it does not hold up to heat and leaves an aftertaste if you use a lot of it.
