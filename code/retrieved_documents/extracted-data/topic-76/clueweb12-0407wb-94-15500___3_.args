the sugar is not exploited to any great extent in the food industry, but research published in thejournal of agricultural and food chemistry indicates the potential of the sugar to find application in a range of products, most notably as a sucrose substitute.according to market researcher freedonia, overall sweetener prices are forecast to see erosion, following an increased dynamism in the sweetener industry, which is currently seeing a number of new options available after years of relative stability.it has 70 per cent the sweetness of sucrose, but also has functional properties like gelling activity, good flavour, as well as high antioxidation activity."thus, d-psicose could be used as a sweetener to develop a functional food with a high antioxidant activity and a low calorie content by controlling the colour change of the final products," they concluded."on the other hand, artificial intense sweeteners (such as aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, and cyclamate) are almost calorie-free, but their function is only to sweeten and inherently lack the bulk of sucrose."the excessive consumption of sucrose can be ill-advised because of the high calorie content and a high glycemic response," wrote lead author yuanxia sun from kagawa university.rare sugar may replace sucrose for bakery and beyond by stephen daniells, 09-jun-2008 related topics: formulation, ingredients and additives the rare sugar d-psicose may be an ideal substitute for sucrose, and have the added benefits of boosting antioxidant activity and boosting shelf-life, say japanese researchers.however, if you would like to share the information in this article, you may use the headline, summary and link below: rare sugar may replace sucrose for bakery and beyond the rare sugar d-psicose may be an ideal substitute for sucrose, and have the added benefits of boosting antioxidant activity and boosting shelf-life, say japanese researchers.according to the results, the foaming of the egg white protein was improved by the addition of d-psicose at a 15 per cent of sugar content.text size print email by stephen daniells, 09-jun-2008 related topics: formulation, ingredients and additives the rare sugar d-psicose may be an ideal substitute for sucrose, and have the added benefits of boosting antioxidant activity and boosting shelf-life, say japanese researchers.sweet potential the japanese researchers investigated the effects of d-psicose on the foaming properties of egg white protein and the quality of butter cookies."the antiradical activity and reducing power of the cookies are strongly related to the colour change of the cookie crust." "the results did not show a clear mechanism by which addition of psicose induced the high foaming property of egg white protein, but confirmed that the addition of psicose was much more effective than the addition of sucrose, especially in the case of a longer whipping," they wrote.under a longer whipping time, the researchers report that the d-psicose-egg white solution was"better in foaming capacity compared to sucrose- and fructose-egg white solutions.no significant changes in cookie quality were reported.
