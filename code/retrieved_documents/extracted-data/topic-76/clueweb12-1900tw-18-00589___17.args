so it’s really great for diabetics or hypoglycaemic or people who just have blood sugar fluctuation problems.
brown rice syrup is one of the best sweeteners because it's a fermented form of sugar and doesn't cause as much of a blood sugar swing as most others.
and then pureed fruits are really good at mixing things when you’re doing some baking as well.
and again, my favourite to used is fruit and anything else i just try to minimize as much as possible and keep as whole as possible when i get it.
splenda and other artificial sweeteners (nutrasweet, sweet n low, etc) are chemicals, and may not add calories or raise your blood sugar, but will have other negative effects.
it’s a good idea to try to minimize the use of sweeteners in general, but if you have a sweet tooth like me, choosing good ones lets you give in without throwing off your healthy eating plan.
so it’s always best when you’re looking at fruits to go for the whole food form as much as possible; and sweeteners are the same thing.
but if you want to, the liquid is okay as well.
the other things are the artificial sweeteners so those are ones where they say that because it doesn’t have an effect on blood sugar.
stevia is a leaf, which doesn't sound very much like a sweetener, but it's actually even more potent than sugar.
let me know by leaving comment and i will see you guys next time.
so my main example would be apple sauce, great to use in baking and you wanna go for the unsweetened kind because fruit has the natural sugars in it already.
so, i’m gonna go over my top ones but first thing i just wanna say that whenever you’re using sweeteners the best idea is to minimize how much you’re using.
but when you look at something like brown sugar, one thing i learned that was pretty surprising to me is that brown sugar is just white sugar same refined white crystals which is a bit of molasses added back to them.
just don't have too much at once and you'll be fine.
it’s the good part; it’s got a lot of iron, magnesium, stuff like that.
molasses as i mentioned, it has all of the nutrients from the sugar even though it is technically processed and a little bit refined because it comes off.
so my top sweetener is fruit, i loved to use fresh fruit on top of my morning porridge.
and it taste great in gingerbread cookies.
grain sweeteners brown rice syrup is one of the best sweeteners because it's a fermented form of sugar and doesn't cause as much of a blood sugar swing as most others.
in my opinion, the sweeteners above that are much closer to their whole food state are the better option.
i don’t know if you can see that very well on camera, but that’s just crystals that have been turned a little bit brown by molasses.
so, i think fruit, sucanat, stevia, brown rice syrup, molasses and maple syrup are the best sweeteners.
the name on the one i buy is sucanat, and wholesome sweeteners is a brand to look for at your grocery store.
dried fruits and baking so raisins, things like that can sweeten things up really nicely.
demerara, turbinado, 'raw' sugars – they've been refined, crystallized and coated in molasses to make them brown.
i’m talking about things like splenda, nutrasweet, sweet n low, all those things, they’re chemicals –so they’re- they’re not good.
unrefined sugar (sucanat) there are unrefined versions of cane, palm and other sugars.
now white sugar has had all of the nutrients stripped away and then the main thing they get stripped off is molasses so that’s another sweeteners that i like to used because it has all of those nutrients in it.
now, cactus is not naturally sweet and the syrup has to be heavily refined to get it there.
all of the nutrients from the sugar are in the molasses, so it's really high in things like iron, magnesium and b vitamins.
and again, my favourite to used is fruit and anything else i just try to minimize as much as possible and keep as whole as possible when i get it.

(note that this does not include the maple-flavored pancake syrups – those ones are terrible, stay away from them.)
any time you see a crystallized sugar, it's been refined and then formed into a crystal.
so while i like molasses okay, i don’t like brown sugar because it’s mainly just the white part; and then there’s some other types of refined sugars like this one is demerara.
molasses when sugar is refined into white crystallized sugar, part of what's taken away is molasses.
the other things are the artificial sweeteners so those are ones where they say that because it doesn’t have an effect on blood sugar.
unrefined sugar looks like grains of sand, not like crystals.
when sugar is refined into white crystallized sugar, part of what's taken away is molasses.

(note that this does not include the maple-flavored pancake syrups – those ones are terrible, stay away from them.)
today i wanna talked about the best sweeteners to use.
some other sweeteners that i used so there are some liquids brown rice syrup is a good one.
stevia is one non-sugar, zero-calorie sweetener that's actually natural and isn't harmful to you.
it is a little bit processed; they have to cook it for a really long time to get it sweetened up but in the big scheme of things, it’s a pretty decent sweetener to use.
just, it’s a cane sugar so it’s just a juice from the cane, the middle of the cane just dried, where every time you see a crystal it’s been refined in some way.
brown sugar is just white sugar with a bit of the molasses added back to it.
it is a little bit processed; they have to cook it for a really long time to get it sweetened up but in the big scheme of things, it’s a pretty decent sweetener to use.
i slice fresh fruit into my morning porridge, i use applesauce and blended banana in baking, and i use dried fruits like dates and raisins in anything from oatmeal to cookies to coleslaw.
you only need a tiny bit of stevia to sweeten, so be careful with it.
i slice fresh fruit into my morning porridge, i use applesauce and blended banana in baking, and i use dried fruits like dates and raisins in anything from oatmeal to cookies to coleslaw.
it is a processed product, but overall it has a lot going for it.
maple syrup is another liquid one, and when i talk about a maple syrup, i’m talking about like the pure stuff not the maple flavoured pancake syrups.
but if you want to, the liquid is okay as well.
so stevia is best when if you use it in the whole leaf form, so that would be, it comes as green leaves that look pretty much like tea leaf and you’ll see them in some tea bags, if you look in the ingredients sometimes.
so, i think fruit, sucanat, stevia, brown rice syrup, molasses and maple syrup are the best sweeteners.
it's not the best sweetener because it does give a kick to your blood sugar levels, but it's also not the worst and isn't refined too much.
unrefined sugar looks like grains of sand, not like crystals.
it's a really mild flavor, and will add a low level of sweetness to whatever you're making.
the white powder is a refined form, and isn't as good for you.
it’s a good idea to try to minimize the use of sweeteners in general, but if you have a sweet tooth like me, choosing good ones lets you give in without throwing off your healthy eating plan.
it's a really mild flavor, and will add a low level of sweetness to whatever you're making.
the best sweeteners are the ones that are as close to whole as possible, don't cause too much of a blood sugar swing and still taste good.
so, i’m gonna go over my top ones but first thing i just wanna say that whenever you’re using sweeteners the best idea is to minimize how much you’re using.
okay they used them, the green leaf to extract.
it is processed, but not so much that it loses all of its nutrients.
today i wanna talked about the best sweeteners to use.
same thing with muscovado sugar looks like just brown sugar and turbinado as well, it’s darker so there’s more molasses in there but it’s still crystals.
so my main example would be apple sauce, great to use in baking and you wanna go for the unsweetened kind because fruit has the natural sugars in it already.
and i store it in my apple sugar jar once i finished my apple sauce and if you can see there it looks like little grains of sand.
so again, you wanna look for this grainy looking, grainy looking sugar.
any time you see a crystallized sugar, it's been refined and then formed into a crystal.
stevia is the option, the natural option to use if you want a no calorie, no blood sugar or fat sweetener.
agave nectar is a syrup that comes from cactus.
dried fruits and baking so raisins, things like that can sweeten things up really nicely.
the best is to use the leaf, the powdered leaf or a liquid extract.
it's not the best sweetener because it does give a kick to your blood sugar levels, but it's also not the worst and isn't refined too much.
and then they also grind that up into a powder, if you wanna make sure you’re looking for the green powder because it comes from the leaf, where’s the white powder is somewhat the same as white sugar where things have been taken away.
so my top sweetener is fruit, i loved to use fresh fruit on top of my morning porridge.
maple syrup is another liquid one, and when i talk about a maple syrup, i’m talking about like the pure stuff not the maple flavoured pancake syrups.
but when you look at something like brown sugar, one thing i learned that was pretty surprising to me is that brown sugar is just white sugar same refined white crystals which is a bit of molasses added back to them.

the white powder is a refined form, and isn't as good for you.
there’s especially one brand of tea i forget which one it is now but they often use stevia.
the cool thing about stevia is that it doesn't affect blood sugar levels, so this is really great for diabetics and hypoglycemics.

a couple that i don’t use and that often get thought of in the healthy category, i just wanted to mention quickly, so agave syrup is very highly processed they comes from a cactus.
sucanat (unrefined cane sugar) is one of the best sweeteners this transcription will have some mistakes because it is partially automated.
