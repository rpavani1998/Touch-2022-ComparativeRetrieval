according to the results, the foaming of the egg white protein was improved by the addition of d-psicose at a 15 per cent of sugar content.
"the excessive consumption of sucrose can be ill-advised because of the high calorie content and a high glycemic response," wrote lead author yuanxia sun from kagawa university.
" "the results did not show a clear mechanism by which addition of psicose induced the high foaming property of egg white protein, but confirmed that the addition of psicose was much more effective than the addition of sucrose, especially in the case of a longer whipping," they wrote.
"on the other hand, artificial intense sweeteners (such as aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, and cyclamate) are almost calorie-free, but their function is only to sweeten and inherently lack the bulk of sucrose.
under a longer whipping time, the researchers report that the d-psicose-egg white solution was"better in foaming capacity compared to sucrose- and fructose-egg white solutions.

the rare sugar d-psicose may be an ideal substitute for sucrose, and have the added benefits of boosting antioxidant activity and boosting shelf-life, say japanese researchers.
