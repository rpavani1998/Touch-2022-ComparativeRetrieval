but for soda addicts in particular, the switch to diet may cut significant calories and be a good stepping stone to healthier beverages, such as water and occasional fruit juices.although this research is preliminary, it is part of a growing body of evidence that sweeteners are not a fool-proof alternative to regular sugar."artificial sweeteners can also activate the glucose sensor and increase the capacity of the intestine to absorb more sugar," soraya shirazi-beechey, lead author of the study and a professor of molecular physiology and biochemistry at liverpool university, tells the daily mail.in fact, the jury is still out on artificial sweeteners, as a recent study found theymay help prevent weight gain.when the sugars are inside the cane (or beat or corn or fruit), they come balanced with vitamins, fiber, water, and other nutrients, many of which we probably don't understand or haven't "discovered" yet.just as your taste buds can't differentiate between regular and artificial sweeteners (aside that chemically aftertaste), the receptors in your intestines aren't able to tell the difference either.other studies have found that sweetenersdon't satisfy the cravings in the brain the way real sugar does, meaning that after that diet soda you may still be craving something sweet.true, swapping a can of coke zero for the regular kind slices 139 calories from your daily intake, but research from the university of liverpool in england suggests thatyour body processes artificial, calorie-free sweeteners the same way it does regular sugar .reply artificial sweeteners are toxic.when we strip one thing out of its setting and concentrate it heavily (like extracting sugar crystals from the cane or beet or fruit or corn or anything else), we're making it much harder to maintain that healthy balance.so while science continues to debate, cut back on sugar and sweeteners all together -- everything in moderation is the real key to weight loss.once the intestines sense sweetness, they seek out glucose to absorb.my husband is a (non-insulin dependent) diabetic and has been using splenda for years with great success.if i ingest any of them by accident, within about an hour, i am dizzy, off-balance, fuzzy-headed and sometimes get a headache.so even though that equal is calorie-free -- your body may still take calories from somewhere else if these receptors are activated.
