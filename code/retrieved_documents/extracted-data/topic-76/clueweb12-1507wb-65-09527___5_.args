nonnutritive sweeteners, also called sugar substitutes or artificial sweeteners, do not provide calories and will not influence blood sugars.nutritive sweeteners provide calories or energy to the diet at about four calories per gram, just like carbohydrate or protein.when used in moderation as part of a healthy and wellbalanced diet, sugar substitutes can contribute to the enjoyment of eating.although its chemical structure is very close to that of sucrose or table sugar, sucralose is not recognized by the body as a carbohydrate and has no effect on insulin secretion or overall carbohydrate metabolism in healthy human beings.although technically considered a nutritive sweetener contributing four calories per gram, aspartame is 200 times sweeter than sugar and very little is needed to achieve sweetness.because sugar alcohols are absorbed and metabolized by the body more slowly, they were once believed to be good sugar substitutes for people with diabetes.however, sugar alcohols sometimes cause abdominal discomfort and, because they provide calories, they are not as popular a choice as artifical sweeteners.although non-nutritive sweeteners taste sweet and do not add calories to food, they often cannot be substituted directly for sugar in recipes.because it is stable even when subjected to extreme heat or cold, sucralose can be used in a variety of cold and hot drinks, pastries and baked goods, and frozen and canned fruits and vegetables.once they have been approved it means that they are suitable for use by all canadians, including those with diabetes.sugar alcohols also provide energy to the body and may affect your blood glucose.use moderation when used in moderation as part of a healthy and wellbalanced diet, sugar substitutes can contribute to the enjoyment of eating.this sweetener is heat stable, so it can be used in hot and cold foods.sugar alcohols because sugar alcohols are absorbed and metabolized by the body more slowly, they were once believed to be good sugar substitutes for people with diabetes.current research shows that it is the amount of carbohydrate eaten and the rate of its digestion that are the most important factors in blood glucose control.
