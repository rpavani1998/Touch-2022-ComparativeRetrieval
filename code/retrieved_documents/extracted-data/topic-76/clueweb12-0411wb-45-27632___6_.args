malt syrup is better tolerated by diabetics because it doesn’t stimulate insulin production.because of their high humectancy, syrups will attract moisture and keep products soft for extended periods of time.caloric values will remain high, and other ingredients have to be introduced that mimic the tenderizing qualities of white sugar.artificial sweeteners have no place in a yeast dough; common substitutes for sugar being lower levels of non-diastatic malt syrups or molasses which support yeast fermentation activity, and promote crust browning.maple syrup is limited as an inclusionary ingredient, but does provide excellent flavour profiles – both on its own, and with vanilla.over thousands of years, our bodies have used natural sweeteners such as fruit, honey, leaves and bark to satisfy the craving for sugar.the position of sugar in the ingredient list and the nutritional facts table will largely determine how the general public views the baking industry’s ability to supply nutritious and beneficial foods.as with all artificial sweeteners, consumption over extended periods of time, toxicology tests and long-term use will determine stevia’s safety in food products.these are natural sweeteners that do not trigger an insulin reaction (xylitol can be derived from birch tree pulp).formulating with substitutes at the retail level is error prone, and diagnosing how to fix inferior baked goods can be hit and miss.honey is available in light, amber and dark, with taste and colour determined by the surrounding flora.they have half the calories of sugar, and are not digested by the small intestine.rice or barley syrups are produced by using enzymes to convert the starch into a sweet syrup.as a retail baker, most of my recipes combine two or three sugar substitutes, the easiest to source being splenda® or splenda® sucralose – artificial sweeteners which can be bought either commercially or from a local supermarket.as a retail baker, most of my recipes combine two or three sugar substitutes, the easiest to source being splenda® or splenda® sucralose – artificial sweeteners which can be bought either commercially or from a local supermarket.
