produced by bees, it's a very natural form of sweetener that requires next to no processing before use.white sugar is processed from sugar cane to have the molasses removed, and then it's filtered, crystalized and dried.liquid honey will crystalize over time, but whipped honey will remain soft (like butter) indefinately.it's made by adding the molasses back to regular white sugar, which makes it much moister and more prone to clumping than white sugar.raw sugar raw sugar is very similar to brown sugar, except this is sugar that hasn't been processed into white.though many a good coffee connoisseur takes their brew strong and black, adding a bit of something sweet is a practice enjoyed by many.it's lighter than brown sugar in flavour, but the texture is more coarse (almost like kosher salt).it's actually an herbal product that is far sweeter than sugar.these are not literally identical, but they are the products produced at different stages of sugar processing.you can get white sugar in regular granulated form, or finer ground as icing sugar or confectioner's sugar.any added benefit from the extra molasses in either brown or raw sugar is pretty negligible, considering the small amounts added to your drinks.so it has its natural molasses content intact.honey of course, honey isn't a kind of sugar, but it's a popular sweet touch nonetheless.i have heard that a piece of white bread in the container will keep your brown sugar soft.brown sugar brown sugar is my personal favorite.
