as it turns out, i really like the taste of unsweet tea (and only very mildly sweetened coffee).
sodas are expensive, sweetened water, and you can drink a lot of tea for the price of a can of coke.
you'll also find it squeezed into baked goods, canned vegetables, breads, soups, ketchup, sandwich meats, hot dogs, jams and jellies, taco sauce, salsa, low-fat half-and-half -- you name it.
you'll have to look for more organic products and avoid more pre-packaged foods.
i used to feel these kind of compulsions all the time, and was glad to be free of them, so the craving really surprised me.
since we've made friends with sugar, we've discovered that a little sugar goes a looong way.

instead of dumping splenda into our coffee, we're using just a touch of raw, unrefined sugar.
we find that sugar regulates itself.
you'll have to start asking questions about the slop your favorite restaurants serve.

instead of eating artificially sweetened syrup on our pancakes, we're using pure sorghum syrup.
since we've switched to caffeine-free teas, we feel better ... but we've really, really noticed the difference in our wallets.
(it won't go away any time soon, though, even if it's killing us all -- because america's got a lot of corn, and the corn lobby in america is one of agriculture's most powerful political lobbies.)
the primary impact of this change has been financial: diet cokes and other sodas have dropped from our shopping list.
sodas and most fruit juices are laced with nutrasweet, splenda, hfcs, or, in some bizarre cases, all three.
i used to feel these kind of compulsions all the time, and was glad to be free of them, so the craving really surprised me.
because the best (and, really, theonly) way to avoid hfcs is to buy fresher, organic foods, we're also eating better food that's better for us.
later in the day, i found myself absolutely craving sweets.
that means there's more hfcs in that pizza than meat, tomato sauce, or cheese.)
i'm a guy who makes his living by finding just the right words at just the right time, and i had noticed that, as my consumption of diet coke and nutrasweet increased, my bouts ofaphasia -- the inability to recall a desired word -- had also increased in their frequency and severity.
clyde, too, had pounded down an artificially-sweetened beverage with lunch ... and, without knowing my story, he came home and said, "i don't know what's wrong with me, but, despite the fact i've eaten more today than i've eaten in weeks, i'm starving!"
while getting nutrasweet and splenda out of our diets was pretty easy ... getting hfcs completely out of our bodies is proving to be almost impossible.
also: i'm not a big eater of vegetables, but i have discovered that i love them cold and raw, dipped in newman's organic (hfcs-free) dressings.
last sunday, for the first time in months, i scarfed down a diet coke sweetened with nutrasweet with my lunch.
your conversation will flow.
start reading labels, and you'll be shocked at just how many products are laced with the stuff.
when we can, we're eating food sweetened with sugar or cane syrup instead of hfcs.
you'll have to get over your corporate-induced fear of a packet or two of raw sugar.
again, good news: once you swap home-brewed tea and fruit juices for pre-packaged sodas, you'll feel the difference in your wallet (and your head, and, very likely, your waistline) right away.

what we're up to this particular adventure really beganquite a while back, when we decided to stop consuming aspartame, also known asnutrasweet.

with our palettes unsullied by a constant barrage of sweet, sweet, sweetness, we're noticing more complex flavors in our food: the nutty taste of teas, the subtle cinnamon note in coffee, the touch of citrus in fresh vegetables.
what we're up to this particular adventure really beganquite a while back, when we decided to stop consuming aspartame, also known asnutrasweet.
that fast, dramatic difference made us wonder about the impact of the other artificial sweeteners we were consuming.
good news: within a week of going off of nutrasweet, my fluency with words returned, andmy aphasia went away entirely.
you'll have to get over your corporate-induced fear of a packet or two of raw sugar.
when we do have something sweet, we have less of it ... because real sugar satisfies us in a way that artificial sweeteners and hfcs cannot.
hfcs is super-sweet and super-cheap, which is why almost all soft drink manufacturers have switched to it from sugar.

we suspect that eating zero-calorie sweeteners "prime" the body to look for the calories it thinks should accompany the consumption of sweets ... and that, when it doesn't find them, the cravings begin.
while the name suggests that high fructose corn syrup is something native american maidens squeeze from whole ears of corn, the truth is far more sinister: hfcs is brewed in huge vats ina wicked stew of chemicals and enzymes.
