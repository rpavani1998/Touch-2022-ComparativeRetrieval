its reputation as a fat promoter has likely been overstated, and it is no more a culprit in the epidemic of obesity than any other refined sugar.nutritionally, refined carbohydrates (sweeteners) should account for no more than 10 percent or so of our daily calories.the problem, according to a 2004 study by s. j. nielsen, ph.d., and b. m. popkin, ph.d., reported in theamerican journal of clinical nutrition, is that fructose is digested, absorbed and metabolized differently than glucose and that difference may lead to obesity.insulin can reduce our desire to eat, either directly by its effect in the brain, or indirectly by increasing leptin release by fat cells in a delayed response.glucose stimulates insulin production.some studies indicate our bodies dont recognize sugary soft drink calories well enough to compensate naturally through eating less.the fda had earlier come to its defense, claiming, high-fructose corn syrup is as safe for use in food as sucrose, corn sugar, corn syrup and invert sugar.some studies indicate our bodies don’t recognize sugary soft drink calories well enough to compensate naturally through eating less.manufactures favor hfcs because its cheap, sweeter than sugar, more stable than sugar and can be labeled all natural.in this instance, insulin – the “fat storage hormone” – provides the mechanism that prevents us from overeating.hence the low insulin concentration from ingesting fructose yields a lower average leptin concentration, which would induce us to eat more.manufactures favor hfcs because it’s cheap, sweeter than sugar, more stable than sugar and can be labeled “all natural.”inside the cell, fructose is converted to fructose-1-phosphate, whereas glucose is converted by glycokinase to glycose-6-phosphate, which means that it’s a little easier for fructose to become glycerol, the backbone of triglycerides and phospholipids.inside the cell, fructose is converted to fructose-1-phosphate, whereas glucose is converted by glycokinase to glycose-6-phosphate, which means that its a little easier for fructose to become glycerol, the backbone of triglycerides and phospholipids.we offer processing best practices as well as new products, equipment and ingredients for food and beverage processors.
