saccharin is one of the most studied food ingredients and the totality of evidence indicates it is safe for human consumption.these sweeteners can be used with diabetes, but can mildly change blood sugar levels.pre-approval research has shown that long term or heavy use may contribute to serious chronic immunological or neurological disorders.some people are not necessarily "allergic" to glucose (sugar) or fructose (fruit sugar) , but are nevertheless intolerant of these sugars or have a metabolic difficulty processing them in their bodies.a glucose/insulin metabolism imbalance can be a cause of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia (diabetes).xylitol helps prevent sinus and ear infections, and may guard against osteoporosis.these sugars raise blood sugar and insulin levels more than others do and can pile on fat.studies have also suggested xylitol increases energy by enhancing atp production, increases utilization of fat, increases endurance, and has antioxidant functions.it is safe to use with no consumption limits other than some risk for gas or diarrhea with too high an individual dose, but xylitol causes less gastrointestinal symptoms than most of the other sugar alcohols.other symptoms of this imbalance can be cold hands and feet, disorientation, dizziness, fatigue, headache, nausea, and any of the other myriad of symptoms associated with too high or too low blood sugar.it is more nutritious re vitamins, minerals, and trace elements than most other sweeteners.a study showed that as many as 18% of premature births were caused by gum disease, an impact as strong as that of smoking or alcohol abuse.it is high in fiber and rich in vitamins and minerals.symptoms of fructose intolerance can be behavioral changes, depressed immune function, dizziness, fatigue, headache, and weakness.raw organic honey is not heated or processed and thus maintains the nutrients found in honey.
