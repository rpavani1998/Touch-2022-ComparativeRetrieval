these properties make sweeteners derived from reb a an attractive alternative to nutritive sweeteners for those with diabetes; studies indicate that sweeteners derived from reb a are just as effective as other artificial sweeteners.these nonnutritive sweeteners (also known as sugar substitutes) can help individuals with diabetes manage their blood glucose more easily while allowing them to consume many of their favorite foods.these products contribute no calories to the diet, pack high-intensity sweetness in a small amount of product, and elicit a negligible glycemic response, making them attractive to those with diabetes.aside from minimizing the metabolic effects to blood glucose levels that occur with the consumption of nutritive sugars, sugar substitutes can be extremely useful for weight management efforts, which in turn can help keep blood glucose levels in check.these natural sugars include table sugar (sucrose), fructose, honey, brown sugar, molasses, maple syrup, and agave nectar and are considered nutritive sweeteners, supplying 4 kcal per gram to the diet.sugars of this type are also metabolically active, raising blood glucose upon consumption and making prudent intake crucial for successful diabetes management.by helping their clients determine whether or not these products are in line with their disease management goals and personal preferences, rds can assist those with diabetes in achieving better glycemic control without placing undue restrictions on the types of foods consumed.sugar alcohols (eg, sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol) are reduced-calorie sweeteners that still provide calories (approximately 2 kcal/g) yet are less energy dense than natural sources of sugar due to their incomplete metabolism.they are not without side effects, though; because sugar alcohols are not completely digested and absorbed, they can lead to gastrointestinal distress for some individuals.while sugars may elicit a quicker metabolic response, it is total carbohydrate intake that is the predominant factor in blood glucose management, of which sugar intake is only one component.according to tammy randall, ms, rd, ld, cde, director of education at the diabetes association of greater cleveland and current ohio dietetic association president, one of the best ways rds can help clients with diabetes successfully incorporate sugar substitutes into their diet is by educating them on how to accurately evaluate the foods they consume and not make choices based on manufacturer packaging.these foods are no longer the ubiquitous “bad guys” and can be successfully incorporated into a diabetes management plan when consumed in moderation and included wisely.particularly appealing is sugar substitutes’ ability to add palatability to some low-calorie foods without substantially increasing caloric content.one compound isolated from the stevia plant (reb a) is calorie free (allowing it to be used like a sugar substitute) and 200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar, and it received generally recognized as safe status from the fda in 2008.2 however, it differs from artificial sweeteners in that claims can be made that it is from a “natural” plant source.dietitians seeking further discussion on the safety of sugar substitutes that is applicable to dietetics practice can refer to the ada’s position statement.1 additionally, the american diabetes association cautions that using sugar substitutes comes with a few additional concerns, including an often higher price tag for prepared products, a higher fat content for palatability, significant amounts of carbohydrates remaining in the product despite advertised claims, and potential gastrointestinal side effects (especially with sugar alcohols).
