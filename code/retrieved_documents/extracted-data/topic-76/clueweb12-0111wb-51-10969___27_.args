artificial sweeteners in general can cause all sorts of gastrointestinal side effects, from gas and diarrhea to severe cramping.soluble fiber (both foods and supplements) not only normalizes bowel function, it also helps stabilize blood glycemic levels, slows the rate of carbohydrate absorption, improves regulation of blood sugar, and lowers insulin requirements.soluble fiber also stabilizes blood glycemic levels because it regulates the rate at which food leaves the stomach, which helps keep appetite levels under control and is very helpful for diabetes.soluble fiber slows the rate of carbohydrate absorption, improves regulation of blood sugar, and lowers insulin requirements.sugar alcohols are so likely to cause gas, cramping, and bowel dysfunction that foods containing these sweeteners are labeled with a warning about their side effects, and cautions against eating a large amount.soluble fiber foods are always plant foods, and almost always high carbohydrate foods, but it is simply untrue that a higher carb/lower fat and protein diet is unhealthy or leads to weight gain or diabetes.alcohol is very dehydrating, and becoming even slightly dehydrated can seriously impact constipation and bloating.soluble fiber also decreases ldl ("bad") blood cholesterol levels, and therefore reduces the risk of heart disease, which is a serious risk for diabetics.this will dramatically increase the safety of these insoluble fiber foods in terms of the strength of the gastrocolic reflex they trigger (people with ibs suffer from irregular gastrocolic reflexes, and are prone to having the muscle contractions triggered by this reflex go violently out of control, resulting in cramps, diarrhea, and/or constipation).soluble fiber (both foods and supplements) not only normalizes bowel function, it also helps stabilize blood glycemic levels.they also have lower colon cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis rates.irritable bowel syndrome is estimated to affect 15-20% of the general population, but a much higher percentage of people with fibromyalgia suffer from ibs.soluble fiber is a miracle worker for many people in managing all ibs symptoms, whether cramping, diarrhea, and/or constipation.they can all cause digestive side effects ranging from gas and bloating to severe abdominal cramps and urgent diarrhea.soluble fiber also decreases ldl ("bad") blood cholesterol levels, and therefore reduces the risk of heart disease.
