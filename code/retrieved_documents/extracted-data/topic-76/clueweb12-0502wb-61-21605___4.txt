but the research indicates that d-psicose may be an effective substitute.
the sugar is not exploited to any great extent in the food industry, but  research published in thejournal of agricultural and food chemistry indicates the potential of the sugar to find application in a range of  products, most notably as a sucrose substitute.

according to the results, the foaming of the egg white protein was improved by the addition of d-psicose at a 15 per cent of sugar content.
"the excessive consumption of sucrose can be ill-advised because of the high calorie content and a high glycemic response," wrote lead author yuanxia sun from kagawa university.
"food formulators generally need to blend them with sugar to obtain successful end products.
" "the results did not show a clear mechanism by which addition of psicose induced the high foaming property of egg white protein, but confirmed that the addition of psicose was much more effective than the addition of sucrose, especially in the case of a longer whipping," they wrote.
"on the other hand, artificial intense sweeteners (such as  aspartame, sucralose, saccharin, and cyclamate) are almost calorie-free, but  their function is only to sweeten and inherently lack the bulk of sucrose.
under  a longer whipping time, the researchers report that the d-psicose-egg white  solution was"better in foaming capacity compared to sucrose- and  fructose-egg white solutions.
