it can be used in cooking, baking and beverages, does not affect blood sugar levels, and has zero calories.honey, agave, molasses, and cane sugar are also good substitutions but never cook with artificial sweeteners - your creations will taste like chemicals and your body will become intoxicated.the extract from stevia is 100 to 300 times sweeter than white sugar.splenda is horrible for you and should be avoided at all costs (as should all artificial sweeteners including sweet'n'low, equal, nutrasweet etc).it's actually the least processed of granulated sugars and easiest on your body.stevia is available in a powder or liquid form, but be sure to get the green or brown liquids or powders, because the white and clear versions are highly refined.stevia isn't approved by the fda in the us, canada, or the european union because of concerns re: toxicity levels so don't try it until they feed it to the mice for 20 years then tell us the mice died or grew long noses or something gross...oh poor mice!if the coffee shop doesn't have cane sugar then agave is also an okay choice.find pure cane sugar for coffee but try to cut back on sugar in coffee and if cooking/baking use maple syrup, molasses, honey, sweet fruits and vegetables or pure cane sugar.i think stevia is a better option than splenda so in general it is a good switch.since i don't have much of a sweet tooth i haven't experimented with other fun sounding items like rice syrup, barley malt, and date sugar.get creative with cooking and incorporate sweet fruits and vegetables - add mashed bananas, dates, dark chocolate, top something with applesauce, make sweet potato muffins!which reminds me of something...i was recently in line at a coffee shop and the woman in front of me ordered a turbo iced coffee with 6 artificial sweeteners, blueberry flavored syrup, and whipped cream on top.i gave up my splenda addiction about a year ago and always bring my own stevia packets to starbucks every morning.try to test yourself and put a little less and less in each week and see if you can cut it down to just a little cane sugar or none at all.
