not everyone is convinced that artificial sweeteners are good for the body.several years ago i read that it was not safe to consume it because it causes bladder cancer.according to mcneil nutritional llc, it indicated that â...there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for either sucralose or its hydrolysis products...’.other product and company names shown may be trademarks of their respective owners.between sugar from cane and sugar from beets, cane sugar is a better choice which makes me wonder if htb’s “pure sugar” is from beet sugar.according to mcneil nutritional llc, it indicated that â€˜...there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for either sucralose or its hydrolysis products...’.because in my opinion, htb surely is not a place for people who is trying to be on diet nor is it for those trying to get off diabetes.in smaller fonts, it had “pure sugar” printed on one side only, and showed no other information i.e. nutritional facts or net weight, and i wondered why.curiously, i pulled out each of the different colored packages and realized that they were artificial sweeteners.sweeteners i think if you mention home town buffet (htb) or the golden corral, most people may get excited simply for that wide selection of delicious food choices at a reasonable price.but if some day we don’t find real pure sugar on our table, then at least, we know the artificial sweeteners have won the war.out of the three, splenda is the only one says, âsuitable for diabetes’.but then again, it may just trigger a repulsive response in some people who are always counting their calories.it’s a good place with lots of food choices, and depending on the day, you may find your favorite dish served.then in december 14th, 2010, the epa eventually was convinced and publically announced that it is not a potential hazard.
