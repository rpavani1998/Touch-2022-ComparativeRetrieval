they stick less to food; they are corrosion proof; they are harder than metal knives and so stay sharp longer; they won't add metalic flavor to food; they don't react with foods such as lettuce and accelerate the browning of the food.disadvantages: can't sharpen at home when they do get dull; more brittle than are metal knives (but they are stronger than many people think); not as sharp as some of my steel knives, but sharp enough for most slicing jobs.__________________ retiredguy assistant cook join date: sep 2010 posts: 47  ceramic knives are a gimmick, good steel you can sharpen and will last you a lifetime.the bad things are that they are fragile and need special treatment.__________________ 12-27-2010, 01:29 pm #6 retiredguy assistant cook join date: sep 2010 posts: 47 ceramic knives are a gimmick, good steel you can sharpen and will last you a lifetime.i was supposed to be amazed at how sharp it was and how long it held its edge.but i also really like my ceramic knives and use both regularly.__________________ 'a good cook cleans as they cook'...overheard mom explaining to my sisters.i will stick to my carbon steel and /or stainless knives.so i did some reading and ended up buying a kyocera chef's knife.12-26-2010, 10:02 pm #2 andy m. chef extraordinaire join date: sep 2004 location: massachusetts posts: 27,978 i had always heard how great ceramics were.also you need to send them to kyocera for sharpening.__________________ andy m. chef extraordinaire join date: sep 2004 location: massachusetts posts: 27,978 i had always heard how great ceramics were.my henckels were sharper.mine have all been super sharp out if the box.
