to be effective, a cook should have quality, reliable tools, especially when it comes to knives, which are inherently risky if uncomfortable to use, dull or inefficient.gaps or seams in the handle or between the parts of the knife will cause deterioration and can also harbor harmful bacteria.a good knife will be durable: it should last for years with proper maintenance and regular sharpening.good knife skills are important, largely because the size, shape and consistency of cut foods determine cooking time, and thereby the taste, texture and even presentation of a dish.knife safety knives should come with one of those universal disclaimers stating the obvious: improper use can lead to serious injury.ceramic knives came on the scene about 10 years ago, and are prized for their sharpness and precision.being able to handle a knife effectively can be the determining factor in the taste, texture and presentation of a dish.while usually thinner and lighter, the design of stamped knives requires a firmer grip and more pressure when chopping, mincing and dicing.they sharpen easily, but are prone to corrosion and discoloration.holding the knife correctly is vital for safe and efficient cutting.the design of a knife directly affects its balance, sharpness and longevity.a high carbon stainless steel blade is an alloy combining the best of both worlds: it doesn't discolor or corrode, sharpens easily and holds an edge.the bolster should be integrated into the blade, not as a separate collar, so that it can provide adequate protection to fingers and knuckles.stainless steel blades won't rust or corrode, but are more difficult to sharpen.professional knives, which by their manufacture and design are sharp and well balanced, do just one thing very well: they cut.
