ootb most of them aren't real sharp.
i used it on a few other things since i happened to have it (the bf was under strict orders to keep his hands off it though ;) ), and it was very noticeably less sharp.
the downsides are that they are fragile and can shatter if misused or dropped.
my favorite j knife i was able to get so sharp that i could not imagine ever needing it any sharper.
they are very durable and stay sharp for a very long time.

i would rather have a decent steel knife, and a good sharpener any day.
disadvantages: can't sharpen at home when they do get dull; more brittle than are metal knives (but they are stronger than many people think); not as sharp as some of my steel knives, but sharp enough for most slicing jobs.
i don't think so, since no one would buy them in the first place.
my bf used it to cut up a chicken (with bones, which you are not supposed to do) and promptly broke off the tip.

some people have had good luck but it's a crap shoot.
it won't roll or bend to speak of- when subjected to enough shock or force it will simply snap.
tool steel, carbon steel and the best stainless steel knives will get much sharper than the ceramics you buy.

if you are used to a steel knife, definitely stick with it!
a few months later, i was going to be cutting up a bunch of lettuce for a nacho bar, and borrowed my mom's knife, since i happened to be at her house.
unfortunately, they are not sharpenable, and will most definitely break if they are dropped or even placed harshly onto a hard countertop.
i never heard of them before, and i saw this commercial for one, and thought to ask you dc peeps about them __________________ 01-04-2011, 01:36 pm #17 spork head chef join date: may 2009 location: landlocked in southwest u.s. posts: 1,060 not that they would, but it would be in kyocera's interest to make less than great ceramic knives that easily dull, so that customers would have to loyally and repeatedly return them for sharpening... for a fee, perhaps?
they charge $10 to sharpen 2 knives.

from what i have read from the knife experts here at dc, some japanese steel can actually be made sharper than ceramic if you know what you are doing.

i do not have to worry as much if i drop it on a hard surface or hit bone.
ceramic is extremely strong but not very ductile (meaning malleable).
it's just that you have to "special treat them" that has kept me from buying them.
i've seen tips break off and ceramics snap clean in two.
i used it on a few other things since i happened to have it (the bf was under strict orders to keep his hands off it though ;) ), and it was very noticeably less sharp.
however, just as the grand canyon was worn by running water, the knife won't stay sharp forever.
constant use and impact with the cutting board will dull it over time.
i suppose a butcher block would be ok.

it can be done if you have the right equipment, but ceramic isn't all that far from diamond in hardness; diamond is a 10 on the mohs scale while the hardest ceramics are actually between 8 and 9.
lemon always tastes bad in tea.
the safest knife you can have is one you are comfortable using.
also, i found the ceramic knives so sharp that they were actually difficult to use.
you also won't have much luck sharpening them yourself.

i have one and it was super sharp, the sharpest i've ever seen, smart guy!
they also can not easily be sharpened at home.

that means most of the things that can sharpen steel will hardly scratch ceramic.

ceramics are also relatively fragile.
especially glass cutting boards (glass can be nearly as hard as ceramic).
