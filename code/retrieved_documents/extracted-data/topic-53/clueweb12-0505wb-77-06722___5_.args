the downsides are that they are fragile and can shatter if misused or dropped.unfortunately, they are not sharpenable, and will most definitely break if they are dropped or even placed harshly onto a hard countertop.they are very durable and stay sharp for a very long time.from what i have read from the knife experts here at dc, some japanese steel can actually be made sharper than ceramic if you know what you are doing.it won't roll or bend to speak of- when subjected to enough shock or force it will simply snap.12-28-2010, 09:58 am Â  #13 join date: mar 2002 location: boston posts: 7,120 quote: originally posted bygoodweed of the north they stick less to food; they are corrosion proof; they are harder than metal knives and so stay sharp longer; they won't add metalic flavor to food; they don't react with foods such as lettuce and accelerate the browning of the food.12-28-2010, 09:58 am #13 jennyema master chef join date: mar 2002 location: boston posts: 7,120 quote: originally posted bygoodweed of the north they stick less to food; they are corrosion proof; they are harder than metal knives and so stay sharp longer; they won't add metalic flavor to food; they don't react with foods such as lettuce and accelerate the browning of the food.it can be done if you have the right equipment, but ceramic isn't all that far from diamond in hardness; diamond is a 10 on the mohs scale while the hardest ceramics are actually between 8 and 9.tool steel, carbon steel and the best stainless steel knives will get much sharper than the ceramics you buy.disadvantages: can't sharpen at home when they do get dull; more brittle than are metal knives (but they are stronger than many people think); not as sharp as some of my steel knives, but sharp enough for most slicing jobs.ceramic is extremely strong but not very ductile (meaning malleable).ceramics are also relatively fragile.jan 2011 location: southern new jersey, and allentown pa posts: 68 i recently took a class on essential knife skills, and learned a lot regarding knives.i never heard of them before, and i saw this commercial for one, and thought to ask you dc peeps about them __________________ spork head chef join date: may 2009 location: landlocked in southwest u.s. posts: 1,060 not that they would, but it would be in kyocera's interest to make less than great ceramic knives that easily dull, so that customers would have to loyally and repeatedly return them for sharpening...constant use and impact with the cutting board will dull it over time.
