kyocera advanced ceramic knives are made in japan.
first, it's dangerous if someone forgets about the knife or reaches in the wrong way.
you can resharpen your ceramic knife by using our resharpening service.
like forged steel scissors, however, you can break the tip if the scissors land on the tip (very uncommon).
these knives are made of an advanced, high-tech ceramic called zirconium oxide (also called zirconia).
ceramic is harder than all metals, so it is the ideal surface to re-sharpen these softer materials.
a black (hip) blade is made out of a black zirconium oxide and offers extra durability.
this material, which is second in hardness only to diamond, was originally developed for industrial applications where metal components failed.
finally, ceramic knives are very easy to clean with a hand washing or mild bleach solution (blade only).
even so, ceramic knives are intended to complement -- not replace -- your other cutlery.
a black (hip) blade is made out of a black zirconium oxide and offers extra durability.
zirconium oxide is extremely hard, wear resistant, and chemically inert.
we manufacture a wide variety of products including semiconductor packages, capacitors, thermal print heads, resistors, cutting tool inserts, circuit substrates, lcd panels, fiber optic components, car engine components, solar modules, laser printers, wielding nozzles, cellular/phs phones, pump components, synthetic gemstones, thread and wire guides, antenna mounts, and lots of other neat stuff!
ceramic scissors will not shatter when dropped.
second, you can break off the tip or snap off the handle if you use it to pry or twist.
second, violent motion against other objects, especially hard plates, could chip the objects and/or the knife.
we also offer a ceramic knife sharpener for kyocera knives.
you can store your kyocera ceramic knife in a conventional knife block, in an in-drawer tray, or in the package.
you can also damage ceramic scissors by trying to cut very thick material or by trying to bend the blades.

for slicing fruits, vegetables and boneless meats, a kyocera advanced ceramic knife has no equal.
third, dishwashers ruin wood handles.

even so, ceramic knives are intended to complement -- not replace -- your other cutlery.
these knives are made of an advanced, high-tech ceramic called zirconium oxide (also called zirconia).
this type of blade goes through an extra firing process called a "hot-isostatic press," creating a tighter weave between the ceramic molecules, thus creating a tougher blade.

you can also damage ceramic scissors by trying to cut very thick material or by trying to bend the blades.
all kyocera knives comes with a lifetimewarranty.
any knife, whether stainless steel or ceramic, will potentially break at the tip if its dropped on a hard surface at a certain angle.

kyocera advanced ceramic knives are made in japan.
for the technically minded, zirconium oxide has a hardness of 8.2 mohs (vs. steel at 5-6 mohs and diamond at 10 mohs).
it's a great at-home solution to refreshen and resharpen kyocera blades.

use steel knives for carving, prying, boning, cutting frozen foods, and slicing cheese.

the white ceramic blade is also made out of zirconium oxide but does not go through this expensive sintering process.
unfortunately, accidental damage can occur so we do offer resharpening services.

first, you can chip the edge if you cut into bones.
second, violent motion against other objects, especially hard plates, could chip the objects and/or the knife.
the ceramic sharpeners are used to sharpen all steel-based knives, including titanium because the same hardness principle applies.
the answers to these questions and more are readily available.
