this steel excels in toughness and wear resistance and with a good ability to resist corrosion it makes for a fine choice.stainless steel is known to "stain less", but can still show some evidence of corrosion if exposed to particularly acidic or corrosive environments.a "stainless" steel blade can still stain and even rust, although not at the rate a pure carbon steel blade would as the chromium aids in corrosion resistance.chromium added to steel increases the blades hardness and ability to withstand staining and corrosion.this increases the toughness of a steel and may play a role in corrosion resistance.this steel will suffer when used on abrasive materials and is not known for holding an edge well.this state is desirable and is the first step in altering the steelâ€™s properties to perform as needed.again, achieving just the right balance of trade offs between these different characteristics is the aim of the steelmaker and the "right" balance depends on the intended use of the steel.however steels at this level of hardness will also be more difficult to sharpen and will be more brittle and susceptible to chipping.vanadium like chromium, vanadium will also increase hardness but also will improve a blades ability to take a very sharp edge.other alloys can also be added and the presence of these alloys will add characteristics to the material which are useful according to the purpose for which it is being created.toughness is the ability of the blade to withstand shock and impact without cracking, chipping or snapping.inexpensive to manufacture and thus popular on low end knives, this steel is useful and has it place, but not as a top end product.this element also contributes to hardness as well as strength and wear resistance.it is the choice for diving knives which will come in contact with salt water or other highly corrosive environments.
