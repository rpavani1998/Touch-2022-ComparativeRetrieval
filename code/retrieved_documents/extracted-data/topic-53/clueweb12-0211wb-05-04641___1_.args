ideal for resharpening japanese knives which are no longer responding to a fine hone, or for maintaining german or other european style knives.this length is great for just about any kitchen knife, including large chef's knives.also consider the superaser to keep the rod clean and to make it last longer (eventually deposits from the blade will make it even smoother).and be sure to have a fine grit hone on hand before you buy this, to maintain the fine polished edge.this hone is equivalent to 300 grit, which is equivalent to about 800 grit in the japanese system, so it's coarse, but not overly so.language: login | register | contact us | help | view cart - home - sale & clearance - salt & pepper mills - knives - maha powerex - shopping cart this site requires javascript to function properly.works much like a regular butcher steel.if you use the fine hone regularly, you should not have to use this coarse one very often.home :: knife sharpeners :: idahone ceramic sharpening rod, coarse, 10" (26cm) idahone ceramic sharpening rod, coarse, 10" (26cm) view detailed images (1) coarse ceramic sharpening rod, 10".includes a quality black-finished wooden handle and steel hanger.20% details sku id-rb-10 quantity in stock 5 item(s) available retail price: $39.95 your price: $31.95 you save $8.00 (20%) quantity price *note: options quantity (from 1 to 5) 1 - add to cart add to wish list - ask a question about this product - related products - customers also bought edge pro apex knife sharpening system, kit #4 idahone ceramic sharpening rod cleaner, superaser idahone ceramic sharpening rod, fine, 10" (26cm) $258.95 $5.29 $31.95 wusthof chef's case, 12 slot, cordura microplane gourmet fine/spice grater misono swedish carbon steel chef's knife (gyutou), 9.5-inch (240mm) $46.95 $20.95 $197.95 wusthof classic ikon 7-inch (17cm)not responsible for typographical or other unintentional errors.20% details quantity in stock 5 item(s) available retail price: $39.95
