ootb most of them aren't real sharp.
i used it on a few other things since i happened to have it (the bf was under strict orders to keep his hands off it though ;) ), and it was very noticeably less sharp.

i would rather have a decent steel knife, and a good sharpener any day.

disadvantages:  can't sharpen at home when they do get dull; more brittle than are metal knives  (but they are stronger than many people think); not as sharp as some of my  steel knives, but sharp enough for most slicing jobs.
i've yet to own, or even try one, but i'm certain i someday will.
hope that this helps in answering some of your knife questions!
i don't think so, since no one would buy them in the first place.
