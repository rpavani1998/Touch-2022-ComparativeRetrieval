while it may be tempting to buy a  huge knife block gleaming with dozens of deadly implements, you will probably  be wasting your money.
the essential knives no cook should be without include a cook’s  knife (go as long as you can, up to 30cm — you’ll work faster once  you’re used to it); a 10cm paring knife; a boning knife, used like a  dagger to take bones out of meat; a filleting knife with a thin, pliable blade  for filleting fish; a serrated fruit knife (works for softer vegetables too);  and a bread knife.
the end of the blade that extends into the handle is called the tang.
the disadvantage is that it rusts easily, so you should wash it by hand and dry it quickly.
when it comes to materials, ceramic, carbon steel and  stainless steel all have their aficionados.
“you should go for as heavy a knife as you can cope with,  because it’s going to be better quality.”
and when it comes to knives, you get what you pay for, so expect your wallet to feel the pain.

for that reason, it’s probably sensible to get all your  knives from the same manufacturer.
global knives, the choice of many professional chefs, are made from ice-tempered steel and constructed on the same principle as samurai swords.

alas, despite its macho allure, a meat cleaver remains  strictly optional for the domestic cook.
yeah mm i kinda like my fingers i think i'll keep em a few more days ...
ceramic knives are the latest and grooviest addition to the knife block: light and lethally sharp, they hold an edge for years, but you cant sharpen them at home, so they will probably have to go back to the manufacturer when they need a new edge.
heft the knife in your hand to make sure it’s comfortable.
make sure it runs the whole length of the handle, for best balance and  strength.

it goes without saying that good knives should never see the inside of a dishwasher.
