excellent size for someone looking for a somewhat longer blade for home or professional use.
i really love these knives -- i'm sure you'll be thrilled and amazed by the quality, good looks, and high performance of these carbon steel blades, and what an amazing value!
the rosewood handle will be much longer-lasting than the softer and lighter magnolia wood usually seen on traditional japanese knives, and the stainless steel tang inside the handle means that any moisture will not result in premature pitting or damage to the handle.
you know i hate gimicks, but this is one fantastically engineered knife.

all orders subject to approval.
the blade  is made of aogami/blue #2 carbon steel, with a permanent seasoned rosewood  handle and a stainless steel tang.
for  regular everyday maintenance i suggest a fine ceramic hone (see below).
these blades will quickly and easily take a  super sharp edge and hold it like no stainless steel knife can.

it's all really true, so i... marsha schwartz (paul's mom) (feb. 2004)
i never used my behemouth henckel's knife because it's too heavy and didn't stay sharp.
and the "dimples" really work.
the finish is kuro-uchi (black) with a lacquer coating  -- this helps protect the steel and should not be polished off.
comes packed in a very nice gift box.
