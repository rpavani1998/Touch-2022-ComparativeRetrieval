the rosewood handle will be much longer-lasting than the softer and lighter magnolia wood usually seen on traditional japanese knives, and the stainless steel tang inside the handle means that any moisture will not result in premature pitting or damage to the handle.edge is 50/50 bevel, so it is fine for left or right-handed use, and is easily sharpened with any stone or hone or gadget suitable for japanese knives.these blades will quickly and easily take a super sharp edge and hold it like no stainless steel knife can.i really love these knives -- i'm sure you'll be thrilled and amazed by the quality, good looks, and high performance of these carbon steel blades, and what an amazing value!the finish is kuro-uchi (black) with a lacquer coating -- this helps protect the steel and should not be polished off.an especially great addition to a growing collection where you already have a smaller santoku or chef's knife but want something longer for those bigger slicing and dicing jobs.excellent size for someone looking for a somewhat longer blade for home or professional use.the blade is made of aogami/blue #2 carbon steel, with a permanent seasoned rosewood handle and a stainless steel tang.for regular everyday maintenance i suggest a fine ceramic hone (see below).i never used my behemouth henckel's knife because it's too heavy and didn't stay sharp.language: login | register | contact us | help | view cart - home - sale & clearance - salt & pepper mills - knives - maha powerex - shopping cart this site requires javascript to function properly.i love the santoku knife you talked me into buying.you know i hate gimicks, but this is one fantastically engineered knife.weight of knife: 171g 26% details quantity in stock 1 item(s) available retail price: $210.00not responsible for typographical or other unintentional errors.
