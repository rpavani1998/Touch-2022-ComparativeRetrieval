the edge pro is a nice system, if you have a number of knives to sharpen.
my brother has a knife branded by edward don that looks exactly like the sanelli right down to the two-tone coloration except that it's gray with red accents.
by creating the premana professional collection, the aim of coltellerie sanelli s.p.a. is to make a decisive contribution to improving safety, reliability and hygiene at work.
the cutting edge runs to the bolster.
it should not be a problem to find, a chef knife with kullens.
the plastic "bolster", or rather the front end of the handle, is very, very thick and molded at about a 45 degree angle.
this criticism can be made for most western knives, because of the bolster.
edge shape especially designed for professional use.
the exclusive ergonomic handle design is the result of special studies carried out at qualified university institutes (a research unit named epm: ergonomics of posture and movement at the milan polytechnic) and tested by computerized experimental tests.
the steel in japanese knives is harder then those typically found in european knives.
the convex shape of the edge guarantees an efficient support when the user has to exert considerable force.
knife makers put grantons or kullens on numerous styles of knives.
the material used will resist sudden temperature changes (from -40°c to +150°c), corrosive agents and detergents.
however, i just can't get comfortable with the flat edge.
the ergonomic shape brings a sharp reduction in user fatigue.
depending on the properties knife makers value, will effect their choice of steel and how they work with it.
it's impossible to sharpen the very heel, either on stones or belts.
the material used will resist sudden temperature changes (from -40°c to +150°c), corrosive agents and detergents.
no other collection of professional cutlery currently available has all these properties.
this criticism can be made for most western knives, because of the bolster.
the handles green colour makes the knife immediately visible on the work bench: greater safety at work.
the edge can still chip, but the knife won't break, like a ceramic.
all "traditional" euro-style knives with a bolster are fatally flawedre sharpening the 1/4" in front of the bolster.
no other collection of professional cutlery currently available has all these properties.
the handle is perfectly balanced with the blade.
well, my normal recommendation it to get a japanese knife, that's wafer thin with no bolster!
excellent sharpening potential.
the site advertises the green color as being easier to see on the cutting surface.
by creating the premana professional collection, the aim of coltellerie sanelli s.p.a. is to make a decisive contribution to improving safety, reliability and hygiene at work.
the material used is non-toxic and complies with the european rules.
but until you've seen that knife i don't thing you really "get" just how fat the handle is.
i believe there are also sharpeners you can buy to make the same angle.
the thing i can't figure out is how the heck you can sharpen all the way to the heel.
but if you have to cut corners you can at least get the best of an inferior breed.
if you only have the shun, then sending it out, makes more sense.
the knife is made of 440 steel hardened to 52-54 r. 440 is not the best grade of steel, and 52 is pretty soft.
we're talking almost 1" thick vs the 1/4" that you can't effectively sharpen on a traditional german boat anchor.

i need the rock and roll of a traditional chef knife.

a stainless blade with a black handle is pretty visible, and it is not a good idea to leave knives laying around anyway.

the soft, but slightly rough surface makes the handle non-slip and much safer to use.

to compensate makers will sandwich or clad the hard steel, between soft steel.
but if you have to cut corners you can at least get the best of an inferior breed.
the steel is folded so well it wont dull if you use a good cutting board.
the plastic "bolster", or rather the front end of the handle, is very, very thick and molded at about a 45 degree angle.
the 45 degree bolster would get in the way when using the knife to its outer limits of length, i.e halving a melon, and a with the bolster shape and materiel, would be difficult to sharpen without damaging the bolster.

if you use a wood cutting board, wash by hand, and don't drop it on the granite counter top, the edge will last a long time.

lemon always tastes bad in tea.
the edge is not subject to chipping.
a stainless blade with a black handle is pretty visible, and it is not a good idea to leave knives laying around anyway.
many magazine and individual reviews have not found that kullens don't add much, if anything to the performance of a knife.

if you're a little bit more serious than most, but don't want to spend enough to get a japanese knife, get a sab.
kanetsune and shun steels are very similar.
in short, these are the salient properties of the premana professional collection: blades resistant hardness (54-56 hrc).
the soft, but slightly rough surface makes the handle non-slip and much safer to use.
all in all, for my purposes and for the price, i think you would be better off with a commercial grade forschner or dexter, or a german henkels or wusthoff, or for a little more, a japanese vg 10 blade.
the shape of the handle was designed at the computer.
the part about the folding steel or doing it so well, makes a knife with good retention, in general isn't true.

just make sure whoever you send the knife to, is familiar with japanese steel and shuns.
