its good toughness makes it a frequent choice for combat knives.
wear resistance becomes more important for edge holding when very abrasive materials, such as carpet, are being cut.
as an air-hardening steel, don't expect it to be differentially tempered.
normally hardened to around 60 rc, it holds an edge very well and is tough enough even at that high hardness.
it has a fairly high chrome content (12%), but not high enough to classify it as stainless.
we usually want knife-grade steel to have >.5% carbon, which makes it "high-carbon" steel.
if you want to make an educated decision about steels, try to learn the basics of steel properties, and go from there.
the following steels will provide bright lines: l-6 and 15n20 (the swedish version of l-6) -- nickel content o-1 -- chromium content astm 203 e -- nickel content nickel the following steels will provide dark lines: 1095 1084 5160 52100 w-2 d. non-steels used for cutlery talonite - stellite 6k - boye dendritic cobalt (bdc)
my guess is that with the moly gone, more chromium is tied up in carbides -- which means less free chromium for rust resistance, and softer chromium carbides replacing moly carbides for less wear resistance.
the different metals etch at different rates, and depth and color contrast are revealed.
bg-42's biggest difference with ats-34 is the addition of vanadium.
strength: the ability to take a load without permanently deforming.
and for many jobs, where corrosion- inducing materials are contacted (such as food prep), corrosion can affect the edge quickly, so corrosion resistance has a role to play as well.
the advantage of the better steel is that it is strong and tough enough to hold up with a small edge angle -- and smaller edge angles radically out-perform bigger edge angles.
well, the answer depends so much on what the steel is being used for, and how it's heat-treated, that the questioner can never possibly get an accurate answer.
adding a bit of vanadium is an easy way to get a fine-grained steels.
bob's catalog is a must-see for everyone, even for just collectors, as it contains a wealth of information on all kinds of great knife subjects.
nickel: adds toughness.
if you're going to sharpen all your knives at the same angle regardless of steel, you might de-emphasize steel choice somewhat.
but the following steels, by virtue of their > 13% chromium, have much more rust resistance than the above steels.
a maker who has really mastered one particular steel (e.g., dozier and d-2) might be able to make that steel work well for many different uses.
it is an excellent steel, that takes and holds an edge superbly, and is tough (although not as tough as, say, 5160).
a-2 an excellent air-hardening tool steel, it is tougher than d-2 and m-2, with less wear resistance .
distribution of carbides within the steel is what determines wear resistance.
the knifemaker will usually know which steels he can make perform the best.
to start viewing messages, select the forum that you want to visit from the selection below.
any time something hard is being cut, or there's lateral stress put on the edge, strength becomes a critical factor.
it's a little more stain resistant, tougher, holds an edge a little better.
toughness: the ability to take an impact without damage, by which we mean, chipping, cracking, etc.
this steel gives a-2-class toughness and almost-s90v class wear resistance, at reasonable hardness (~59-60 rc).
but, both bg-42 and s90v get a bit harder (and stronger) than s30v. the jury is still out, but it may end up this week's ultimate high-end all-around stainless steel, due to high performance coupled with easier machineability and sharpenability than the other steels in this class.
heat treatment, blade geometry, handle geometry and materials all effect how a knife performs for a particular job.
also tougher than ats-34, and more stain resistant.
it is an oustanding choice when maximum wear resistance is desired, but not super toughness.
a very good stainless steel, with a bit less wear resistance and strength than ats-34.
also strength & wear resistance.
they are very stain resistant, and are tough due to being very soft.
425m and 420hc trail the rest, though the highest-carbon versions of 420hc may compete with next group.
vascowear a very hard-to-find steel, with a high vanadium content.
when done right, it may be a slighter better choice than 440a and its ilk.
tungsten: a carbide former, it increases wear resistance.
sulfur: typically not desireable in cutlery steel, sulfur increases machinability but decreases toughness.
it is slightly tougher, and is slightly more wear resistant, than d-2.
for example, cutting through cardboard (which often has hard embedded impurities), toughness becomes extremely important, because micro-chipping is often the reason for edge degradation.
if that same user would take advantage of s30v's superior toughness and drop the edge angle to 15-degrees-per-side, they would see a large leap in cutting performance, along with the extra wear resistance.
the knifemaker will be making a tradeoff of strength versus toughness.
generally speaking, they retain excellent stain resistance properties, though ats-55 sticks out here as not particularly stain resistant.
stellite 6k has been around for years, but was expensive and very difficult to work, and so is only rarely seen.
s60v has by far the best wear resistance of the group, though consensus is becoming that it should be left around the same hardness as 440c (56ish rc), which means it will be relatively weak compared to ats-34, 154-cm, and vg-10, and so it will indent and lose its edge quickly when strength is required.
however, they are also very weak, and not very wear resistant.
s60v is the winner here when pure abrasion resistance is much more important than edge strength.
edge toothiness: some steels seem to cut aggressively even when razor polished.
as the knifemaker moves from one steel to another, it is often possible to modify the design of a particular knife to take advantage of the newer steel, and raise performance.
but the user is only half the equation; now we will look at what the knifemaker might do with a higher- performance steel.
many people have reported that they are able to get knives using steels that include vanadium, like 8a, sharper than they can get non-vanadium steels like ats-34.
154-cm is the original american version, but for a long time was not manufactured to the high quality standards knifemakers expect, so knifemakers switched over to ats-34.
stainless steels are not differentially tempered.
it rusts easily, however.
the alloying elements have a strong influence on the amount of chromium needed; lower chromium with the right alloying elements can still have "stainless" performance.
toughness: the ability to take an impact without damage, by which we mean, chipping, cracking, etc.
stain resistance (rust resistance): the ability to withstand rust (oxidation).
when combined properly with chromium or molybdenum, tungsten will make the steel to be a high-speed steel.
when maximum toughness is desired, with very good wear resistance, 3v is a great choice.
it is also user-sharpenable, and holds an edge incredibly well.
cpm 10v crucible's somewhat-stain-resistant 10v provides incredible wear resistance with d-2-class toughness.
the cleaner steel will often be stronger and tougher, having less inclusions.
if the same maker moves to much-tougher s30v, he might be able to thin out the edge, thin out the entire knife, and raise the hardness, bringing up performance as a whole.
b. stainless steels remember that all steels can rust.
so never go just by charts and properties; make sure you also consider what the knifemaker can do with the steel.
titanium newer titanium alloys can be hardened near 50 rc, and at that hardness seem to take something approaching a useful edge.
due to the vanadium content, vg-10 takes a killer edge, just like other vanadium steels like bg-42 and aus-8.
present in many steels, and air-hardening steels (e.g., a-2, ats-34) always have 1% or more molybdenum -- molybdenum is what gives those steels the ability to harden in air.
well, what we are looking for is strength, toughness, wear resistance, and edge holding.
i've also read plenty of articles on steels, but here are the ones that i actually had in front of me: bob engnath's blades and stuff catalog.
400 series stainless before cold steel switched to aus-8, many of their stainless products were marketed as being of "400 series stainless".
generally speaking, the amount, type, and distribution of carbides within the steel is what determines wear resistance.
for these steels, even when they're polished for push-cutting, their carbides form a kind of "micro serrations" and slice aggressively.
toughness is obviously important in jobs such as chopping, but it's also important any time the blade hits harder impurities in a material being cut (e.g., cardboard, which often has embedded impurities).
but different jobs require different properties for edge holding.
understanding these properties will get you started to fundamentally understanding steels and how choice of steel can effect performance.
finer-grained steels just seem to get scary sharp much more easily than coarse-grained steels, and this can definitely effect performance.
whittling very hard wood, strength becomes very important for edge-holding, because the primary reason for edge degradation is edge rolling and impaction.
ats-34 is a hitachi product that is very, very similar to 154-cm.
with steel, however, you can get a full listing of its alloying elements, something measureable and somehow satisfying.
so never go just by charts and properties; make sure you also consider what the knifemaker can do with the steel.
this, it's possible for a softer, weaker steel (measuring low on the rockwell scale) to have more wear resistance than a harder steel.
because any particular stainless steel is often heat treated to around the same hardness (i.e., 440c is usually around 57 rc, ats-34 is 59-61 rc, s60v is getting consensus at around 56 rc, etc.) even by different manufacturers, it's a bit easier to give a general feeling of the performance you'll get from different classes of stainless steels, without introducing too many inaccuracies.
it is reasonably tough and holds an edge well, and is easy to sharpen.
both steels are very high in vanadium, which accounts for their incredible wear resistanceg.
c. damascus steel -- see www.dfoggknives.com for much more detail damascus steels are made by forge-welding two or more different metals (usually steels).
note that there can be good reasons that a knifemaker might not change the blade profile even though the steel has changed.
if you want to make an educated decision about steels, try to learn the basics of steel properties, and go from there.
outside salt water use, it is too soft to be a good choice for a utility knife.
so work with the maker to understand the choices being made with the different steels being offered.
if you're going to sharpen all your knives at the same angle regardless of steel, you might de-emphasize steel choice somewhat.
it's easy to get a 10-to-1 perform advantage for certain cutting jobs by cutting 5 degrees off your sharpening angle.
if this is your first visit, be sure to check out the faq by clicking the link above.
s30v backs off on the wear resistance of s90v, but is significantly tougher and easier to sharpen.
maybe instead of higher cutting performance, the maker would rather offer the same cutting performance but in a knife that can take more abuse.
aus-10 has roughly the same carbon content as 440c but with slightly less chromium, so it should be a bit less rust resistant but perhaps a bit tougher than 440c. it competes with higher-end steels, like ats-34 and above.
as such, s90v is in the running with steels like bg-42 as among the best general-purpose stainless steels; however, s90v is even more expensive and difficult to work than bg-42, so it's strictly in the realm of custom makers currently.. cpm s30v: the newest stainless steel from crucible, purpose-designed as a cutlery steel.
a maker who has really mastered one particular steel (e.g., dozier and d-2) might be able to make that steel work well for many different uses.
w-2 reasonably tough and holds an edge well, due to its .2% vanadium content.
as a result, it's easy to fall into the trap of putting too much emphasis on the steel itself.
cpm 3v cpm's incredibly tough 3v gives excellent wear resistance and good stain resistance as well, although when it does stain, it is said to pit rather than surface rust.
it is, like o-1, a forgiving steel for the forger.
b. sharpening for performance that doesn't mean that significant performance advantages can't be had by choosing the right steel for the job.
in fact, choosing a steel can significantly impact the performance of a knife.
present in most cutlery steel except for a-2, l-6, and cpm 420v. molybdenum: a carbide former, prevents brittleness & maintains the steel's strength at high temperatures.
in the section above, we highlighted what the user can do to bring out the best performance in a high-performance steel.
at its most simple, steel is iron with carbon in it.
japanese stainless steels, roughly comparable in carbon content to 440a (aus-6, .65% carbon) and 440b (aus-8, .75% carbon) and 440c (aus-10, 1.1% carbon).
to make sure the ats-34 will take the kind of stresses it might see in this environment, the edge might be left a bit thick (sacrificing cutting performance), or the hardness brought down a touch (sacrificing strength and wear resistance), or both.
a. introduction steel is the heart of the blade.
these steels provide a high-end performance benchmark for stainless steels, and hold an edge well, and are tough enough for many uses (though not on par with good non-stainlesses).
elements of steel c. non-steel used for cutler iv.
obviously, this property can be helpful in corrosive environments, such as salt water.
vg-10 another vanadium-containing high-end stainless steel.
in addition, some types of materials are acidic (e.g., some types of foods), and micro-oxidation can lead to edge loss at the very tip of the edge, over a small amount of time.
l-6 a band saw steel that is very tough and holds an edge well, but rusts easily.
but s60v is often left very soft, around 55-56 rc, to make up for a lack of toughness.
edge holding: the ability of a blade to hold an edge.
the addition of vanadium and the clean manufacturing process (vim/var) also gives bg-42 better toughness than ats-34.
you can't tell by looking at it how well a blade has been heat-treated, and you can only make educated guesses on how well the blade and handle geometry will work.
often, the last numbers in the name of a steel are fairly close to the steel's carbon content.
s90v is cpm's follow-on to 440v, and with less chromium and almost double the vanadium, is more wear-resistant and tougher than s60v -- and, in fact, is probably more wear-resistant than any other stainless steel used in the cutlery industry.
generally speaking, within the hardness range that the steel performs well at, as hardness increases, strength also increases, but toughness decreases.
edge holding is job-specific.
in addition, many modern steels perform so well, that knife decisions can often be made based on other factors than marginal increases in steel performance.
like manganese, it makes the steel more sound while it's being manufactured.
because of choosing the right sharpening angle, the more expensive s30v knife now gives an impressive return on investment.
if you're willing to put up with the maintenance, this may be one of the very best steels available for cutlery, especially where toughness is desired.
for a knife lover, it's worth spending a little time understanding steel properties -- only by doing so well he really understand what the "best steel" might be for his application.
manufacturing process: cleaner, purer steels perform better than dirtier, impure steels.
440a and 12c27 are the leaders of this group, with solid heat treat both perform okay.
they are used in less-expensive knives due to their ease of machining.
silicon: contributes to strength.
moving to differentially-tempered 5160 might allow the maker to re-profile even more for performance.
so to really take advantage of the higher-performance steel, we want the knifemaker to adjust the knife design to the steel, wherever he thinks it's appropriate.
generally speaking, within the hardness range that the steel performs well at, as hardness increases, strength also increases, but toughness decreases.
the billets are heated and welded; to get an idea of the process, see don fogg's url listed in the bibliography.
stainless steels can be forged (guys like sean mcwilliams do forge stainless), but it is very difficult.
it's easy to get a 10-to-1 perform advantage for certain cutting jobs by cutting 5 degrees off your sharpening angle.
maybe instead of higher cutting performance, the maker would rather offer the same cutting performance but in a knife that can take more abuse.
please note, though, that the act of grouping differing steels in classes definitely does oversimplify, and some of these steels might more properly fit between the class it's in, and the following (or previous) one.
in addition, it is possible for different heat treat formulas to leave the steel at the same hardness, but with properties such as toughness, wear resistance, and stain resistance significantly differing.
ceramics numerous knives have been offered with ceramic blades.
the s60v user can leave the edge more obtuse (raise the sharpening angle) to put more metal behind the edge to make it more robust, but now the s60v will suffer serious cutting performance disadvantages versus the thinner ats-34 edge.
if that same user would take advantage of s30v's superior toughness and drop the edge angle to 15-degrees-per-side, they would see a large leap in cutting performance, along with the extra wear resistance.
vanadium: contributes to wear resistance and hardenability, and as a carbide former (in fact, vanadium carbides are the hardest carbides) it contribute to wear resistance.
maybe his customers tend to only buy thicker knives regardless of performance.
you may have toregister before you can post: click the register link above to proceed.
these steels are made with crucible's particle metallurgy process, and that process allows these steels to be packed with more alloying elements than traditional steel manufacturing methods would allow.
because of choosing the right sharpening angle, the more expensive s30v knife now gives an impressive return on investment.
the now-defunct blackjack made several knives from o170-6, and carbon v may be 0170-6.
this material is tough and has great wear resistance, but is relatively weak.
the carbon content (and hardenability) of this stainless steel goes up in order from a (.75%) to b (.9%) to c (1.2%).
it is used often for hunting knives and other knives where the user is willing to trade off a little of 5160's toughness for better wear resistance.
a steel popular with forgers, it is popular now for a variety of knife styles, but usually bigger blades that need more toughness.
contrary to popular belief, both steels are manufactured through the argon/oxygen/decarburization process (aod), not vacuum remelted.
toughness is obviously important in jobs such as chopping,
note that with the rockwell test used to measure hardness in a steel, it is the hardness of the steel matrix being measured, not the carbides.
this leads to the general rule: to really see the advantages of a better steel, exploit that steel in your sharpening program.
many of the 10-series steels for cutlery, though 1095 is the most popular for knives.
it is more stain resistant than the carbon steels mentioned above, however.
maybe his customers tend to only buy thicker knives regardless of performance.
with the molybdenum removed, ats-55 does not seem to hold an edge quite like ats-34, and reports are that it's less rust-resistant.
all 3 steels have some vanadium added (which the 440 series lacks), which will improve wear resistance and refines the grain for both good toughness, and the ability to sharpen to a very keen edge.
aesthetically, the choice of materials is important.
if your knife is marked with just "440", it is probably the less expensive 440a; if a manufacturer had used the more expensive 440c, he'd want to advertise that.
as a result, it's easy to fall into the trap of putting too much emphasis on the steel itself.
as such, you'll see 1060 and 1050, used often for swords.
it is more wear resistant than bg-42.
the high-speed steel m-2 has a high amount of tungsten.
12c27 is said to perform very well when carefully heat treated, due to its high purity.
this is a steel very popular with forgers, as it has the reputation for being "forgiving".
so both steel choice, and the way that steel is handled, can effect cutting performance.
in addition, an objective of the forging process is to end up with a finer-grained steel.
in "stainless" cutlery steels, stain resistance is most affected by free chromium -- that is, chromium that is not tied up in carbides.
if a weak, brittle steel can perform the job when sharpened at 25-degrees-per-side, a strong, tough steel might give you some marginal performance improvements if it, too, is sharpened at 25-degrees-per-side.
6a trails those two steels, though with its vanadium content, can take a razor edge.
boker and kyocera make knives from this type of ceramic.
for example, the 50xx series are chromium steels.
and for many jobs, where corrosion- inducing materials are contacted (such as food prep), corrosion can affect the edge quickly, so corrosion resistance has a role to play as well.
m-2 a "high-speed steel", it can hold its temper even at very high temperatures, and as such is used in industry for high-heat cutting jobs.
generally speaking, expect these steels to lose their edge quickly through abrasion and impaction.
despite the name, all steel can rust if not maintained properly.
finer-grained steels just seem to get scary sharp much more easily than coarse-grained steels, and this can definitely effect performance.
however, to really bring out the performance of the better steel, trying bringing it down to 20-degrees per side, or less.
popular as expensive dive knives these days, because the seals use it as their knife when working around magnetic-detonated mines.
it also refines the grain of the steel, which contributes to toughness and allows the blade to take a very sharp edge.
most files are made from w-1, which is the same as w-2 except for the vanadium content (w-1 has no vanadium).
it has good wear resistance, but is known especially for its outstanding toughness.
but, to really bring out the performance of a particular steel, you need to take advantage of the better steel in your sharpening plan.
but s60v is often left very soft, around 55-56 rc, to make up for a lack of toughness.
for example, cutting through cardboard (which often has hard embedded impurities), toughness becomes extremely important, because micro-chipping is often the reason for edge degradation.
the knifemaker will be making a tradeoff of strength versus toughness.
so both steel choice, and the way that steel is handled, can effect cutting performance.
you can't tell by looking at it how well a blade has been heat-treated, and you can only make educated guesses on how well the blade and handle geometry will work.
but, to really bring out the performance of a particular steel, you need to take advantage of the better steel in your sharpening plan.
8a is also worth a mention, with some vanadium content, it can take an extremely sharp edge very easily, but is also the weakest and least wear-resistant of this group.
note that with the rockwell test used to measure hardness in a steel, it is the hardness of the steel matrix being measured, not the carbides.
there are other properties that significantly effect how a steel performs: ability to take an edge: some steels just seem to take a much sharper edge than other steels, even if sharpened the exact same way.
in addition, carbon steels can be differentially tempered, to give a hard edge-holding edge and a tough springy back.
of course, carbon steels will rust faster than stainless steels, to varying degrees.
randall knives uses o-1, so does mad dog knives.
the knifemaker will usually know which steels he can make perform the best.
bg-42 has better wear resistance than all the previous steels except for s60v. it is tougher than ats-34, and more stain resistant.
heat treatment, blade geometry, handle geometry and materials all effect how a knife performs for a particular job.
mission knives uses titanium.
vg-10 can be thought of as being like ats-34 and 154-cm, but doing just about everything a hair better.
however, with the continued improvement of 52100 heat treat, this steel is starting to show up in larger knives and showing excellent toughness.
adding chromium in high amounts decreases toughness.
it is less tough than 5160.
this is a simple steel, which contains only two alloying elements: .95% carbon and .4% manganese.
the properties of different steels will be laid out below.
understanding these properties will get you started to fundamentally understanding steels and how choice of steel can effect performance.
in place of some of the carbon (infi contains .5% carbon), infi has nitrogen.
this steel is a good cutlery steel but a tier behind ats-34 and its closest competitors (other steels in ats-55's class might be gin-1 and aus-8).
this steel performs well over a wide range of hardnesses, showing great toughess when hardened in the low 50s rc for swords, and hardened up near the 60s for knives needing more edge holding.
in your buying decisions, you might want to take into account the difficulty of sharpening these steels.
if the same maker moves to much-tougher s30v, he might be able to thin out the edge, thin out the entire knife, and raise the hardness, bringing up performance as a whole.
8a is a competitor of middle-tier steels like ats-55 and gin-1.
and as pointed out above, heat treat is absolutely critical to bringing out the best in a steel.
so, the more chromium tied up in carbides, the less free chromium there is, which means more wear resistance but less stain resistance.
vg-10 is also tougher and more rust-resistant than ats-34, and seems to hold an edge better.
it has excellent wear resistance.
maybe the higher-performance steel is not available in the next stock thickness down.
wear resistance: just like it sounds, wear resistance is the ability to withstand abrasion.
but different jobs require different properties for edge holding.
s90v (cpm t420v) two steels that hold an edge superbly, world class type edgeholding, but it can be difficult to get the edge there in the first place.
kevin mcclungcame out with a ceramic composite knife blade that much tougher than the previous ceramics, tough enough to actually be useful as a knife blade for most jobs.
s60v, even at 56 rc, still has more and harder carbides than ats-34 at 60 rc, and thus the s60v is more wear resistant, while the ats-34 would be stronger.
the result is a non-stainless steel that is nevertheless extremely stain resistant (informally reported at close to d-2, or even better), incredibly tough for a high-alloy ingot steel, and with extremely good wear resistance.
this leads to the general rule: to really see the advantages of a better steel, exploit that steel in your sharpening program.
manufacturing process: cleaner, purer steels perform better than dirtier, impure steels.
the resulting replies can never be totally accurate, because depending on the jobs the knife will be used for, the blade geometry, and the quality of the heat treat, what is "best" and what is "worst" can be very fluid.
a good chrome-vanadium steel that is somewhat similar to o-1, but much less expensive.
the ability to withstand rust (oxidation).
well, the answer depends so much on what the steel is being used for, and how it's heat-treated, that the questioner can never possibly get an accurate answer.
note that there can be good reasons that a knifemaker might not change the blade profile even though the steel has changed.
in addition, some types of materials are acidic (e.g., some types of foods), and micro-oxidation can lead to edge loss at the very tip of the edge, over a small amount of time.
not as rust resistant as the 400 series above.
maybe he's particularly good at heat-treating one steel or another, so that the differences between disparate steels are minimized.
any time something hard is being cut, or there's lateral stress put on the edge, strength becomes a critical factor.
so, the more chromium tied up in carbides, the less free chromium there is, which means more wear resistance but less stain resistance.
the combination of great wear resistance, almost-stainlessness, and good toughness make it a great choice for a number of knife styles.
so, the next general rule: knowing the uses you'll put your knife to, and exactly how those uses cause edge degradation, will allow you to make a much better choice of steel, if you generally understand steel properties.
for example, it is possible to make a hard-use "tactical/utility" knife from ats-34.
even left that soft, an abundance of well-distributed vanadium carbides gives s60v superior wear resistance to ats-34, at acceptable toughness levels.
bg-42 bg-42 is somewhat similar to ats-34, with two major differences: it has twice as much manganese as ats-34, and has 1.2% vanadium (ats-34 has no vanadium), so look for significantly better edge-holding than ats-34.
b. sharpening for performance that doesn't mean that significant performance advantages can't be had by choosing the right steel for the job.
it is similar to 5160 (though it has around 1% carbon vs. 5160 ~.60%), but holds an edge better.
the other factor affecting beauty is of course the welding pattern.
steel by itself isn't the sole determiner of knife performance, of course.

there are other properties that significantly effect how a steel performs: ability to take an edge: some steels just seem to take a much sharper edge than other steels, even if sharpened the exact same way.
the properties of different steels will be laid out below.
improves the steel (e.g., deoxidizes) during the steel's manufacturing (hot working and rolling).
one shiney steel and one darker steel etch out to show the most striking pattern.
as the knifemaker moves from one steel to another, it is often possible to modify the design of a particular knife to take advantage of the newer steel, and raise performance.
okay, on to the steels in more detail: 420 lower carbon content (<.5%) than the 440 series makes this steel extremely soft, and it doesn't hold an edge well.
even left that soft, an abundance of well-distributed vanadium carbides gives s60v superior wear resistance to ats-34, at acceptable toughness levels.
it is extremely rust-resistant, and is non-magnetic.
on the internet, i'll often see someone posting about wanting to upgrade from their ats-34 folder to one that has s30v, and then in a different post, declare that they sharpen all their knives at 20-degrees-per-side.
these steels will usually be stronger than the previous group, and more wear-resistant.
52100 is ~1.0% carbon.
aus-6 is used by al mar, and is a competitor to low-end steels like 420j. cold steel's use of aus-8 has made it pretty popular, as heat treated by cs it won't hold an edge like ats-34, but is a bit softer (and therefore weaker) and tougher.
so to really take advantage of the higher-performance steel, we want the knifemaker to adjust the knife design to the steel, wherever he thinks it's appropriate.
in addition, an objective of the forging process is to end up with a finer-grained steel.
is said to be particularly pure and can perform very well when heat treated properly.
for a knife lover, it's worth spending a little time understanding steel properties -- only by doing so well he really understand what the "best steel" might be for his application.
the various kabars are usually 1095 with a black coating.
good at heat-treating one steel or another, so that the differences between disparate steels are minimized.
wear resistance: just like it sounds, wear resistance is the ability to withstand abrasion.
well, what we are looking for is strength, toughness, wear resistance, and edge holding.
moving to differentially-tempered 5160 might allow the maker to re-profile even more for performance.
the resulting replies can never be totally accurate, because depending on the jobs the knife will be used for, the blade geometry, and the quality of the heat treat, what is "best" and what is "worst" can be very fluid.
wear resistance becomes more important for edge holding when very abrasive materials, such as carpet, are being cut.
i should point out that there doesn't appear to be consensus on what percent of chromium is needed for a steel to be considered stainless.
however, to really bring out the performance of the better steel, trying bringing it down to 20-degrees per side, or less.
for those users, even though s60v is more wear-resistant, s60v is also so soft and weak that they will actually see better edge retention with ats-34!
however, m-2 rusts easily.
if we're talking about a fighter, moving from 1095 to 3v might allow the maker to make the knife much thinner, lighter, and faster, while significantly increasing cutting performance and maintaining edge integrity.
for those users, even though s60v is more wear-resistant, s60v is also so soft and weak that they will actually see better edge retention with ats-34!
and as pointed out above, heat treat is absolutely critical to bringing out the best in a steel.
usually, those blades are very very brittle, and cannot be sharpened by the user; however, they hold an edge well.
tygrys makes a knife with a steel edge sandwiched by titanium.
obviously, this property can be helpful in corrosive environments, such as salt water.
420hc 420 modified with more carbon, to be roughly comparable to 440a. 440 a - 440 b - 440c
for many types of jobs, strength is extremely important.
in "stainless" cutlery steels, stain resistance is most affected by free chromium -- that is, chromium that is not tied up in carbides.
but the user is only half the equation; now we will look at what the knifemaker might do with a higher- performance steel.
chromium: added for wear resistance, hardenability, and (most importantly) for corrosion resistance.
50100 is basically 52100 with about 1/3 the chromium of 52100, and the b in 50100-b indicates that the steel has been modified with vanadium, making this a chrome-vanadium steel.
adding a bit of vanadium is an easy way to get a fine-grained steels.
they aren't very stain resistant, however.
the general feeling is that 440a (and similar steels, see below) is just good enough for everyday use, especially with a good heat treat (we've heard good reports on the heat treat of sog's 440a blades, don't know who does the work for them).
in addition, better heat treat can move a steel up in performance significantly.
so, the next general rule: knowing the uses you'll put your knife to, and exactly how those uses cause edge degradation, will allow you to make a much better choice of steel, if you generally understand steel properties.
it is wear resistant to the point where it can be difficult to sharpen.
maybe the higher-performance steel is not available in the next stock thickness down.
so 1095 is ~.95% carbon.
for these steels, even when they're polished for push-cutting, their carbides form a kind of "micro serrations" and slice aggressively.
if a weak, brittle steel can perform the job when sharpened at 25-degrees-per-side, a strong, tough steel might give you some marginal performance improvements if it, too, is sharpened at 25-degrees-per-side.
whittling very hard wood, strength becomes very important for edge-holding, because the primary reason for edge degradation is edge rolling and impaction.
for example, it is possible to make a hard-use "tactical/utility" knife from ats-34.
these cobalt alloys have incredible wear resistance, and are practically corrosion resistant.
well, many users will find edge rolling and impaction the primary causes of edge degradation for everyday use.
to make sure the ats-34 will take the kind of stresses it might see in this environment, the edge might be left a bit thick (sacrificing cutting performance), or the hardness brought down a touch (sacrificing strength and wear resistance), or both.
for many types of jobs, strength is extremely important.
spyderco offers at least one model in cpm s60v. spyderco, one major user of s60v, has cut back hardness down to 55-56rc, in order to keep toughness acceptable, but that sacrifices strength so there is a tradeoff.
(.6% carbon) is a scandanavian steel used often in finish puukkos and norwegian knives.
edge toothiness: some steels seem to cut aggressively even when razor polished.
if we're talking about a fighter, moving from 1095 to 3v might allow the maker to make the knife much thinner, lighter, and faster, while significantly increasing cutting performance and maintaining edge integrity.
5160 is ~.60% carbon.
phosphorus: present in small amounts in most steels, phosphorus is a essentially a contaminent which reduces toughness.
carbon steels are also often a little bit less of a crap shoot than stainless steels -- i believe all the steels named below are fine performers when heat treated properly.
this, it's possible for a softer, weaker steel (measuring low on the rockwell scale) to have more wear resistance than a harder steel.
also increases the strength of the steel but, added in isolation, decreases toughness.
but it's also important any time the blade hits harder impurities in a material being cut (e.g., cardboard, which often has embedded impurities).
if the maker is going more for beauty than performance, he might even go with nickel, which is bright but does not perform as well as steel for cutlery applications.
440-b is a very solid performer and 440-c is excellent.
they can be hardened more than the previous group, for better strength, and they are more wear resistant, though wear resistance is just getting to the point of acceptability.
chromium is a carbide-former, which is why it increases wear resistance.
these materials are essentially very hard carbides suspended in a very soft matrix (40s rc), which gives the great wear resistance but lack of working strength.
here are the important steel alloys in alphabetical order, and some sample steels that contain those alloys: carbon: present in all steels, it is the most important hardening element.
edge holding: the ability of a blade to hold an edge.
carbon v performs roughly between 1095-ish and o-1-ish, in my opinion, and rusts like o-1 as well.
in the section above, we highlighted what the user can do to bring out the best performance in a high-performance steel.
he amount of free chromium (chromium not tied up in carbides), because free chromium is what forms the chromium oxide on the blade surface that offers stain resistance.
with steel, however, you can get a full listing of its alloying elements, something measureable and somehow satisfying.
other alloys are added to make the steel perform differently.
manganese: an important element, manganese aids the grain structure, and contributes to hardenability.
for knives, 1095 is sort of the "standard" carbon steel, not too expensive and performs well.
the cleaner steel will often be stronger and tougher, having less inclusions.
so work with the maker to understand the choices being made with the different steels being offered.
d-2 is much tougher than the premium stainless steels like ats-34, but not as tough as many of the other non-stainless steels mentioned here.
the s60v user can leave the edge more obtuse (raise the sharpening angle) to put more metal behind the edge to make it more robust, but now the s60v will suffer serious cutting performance disadvantages versus the thinner ats-34 edge.
