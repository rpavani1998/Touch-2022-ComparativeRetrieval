to restore a dull edge (when the steel no longer does the job), you can use a ceramic or diamond "steel" (see thewusthof fine and medium), or one of the easy to use and pretty foolproof sharpening systems bychef's choice.
the santoku is the traditional japanese cook's knife, so you can rest assured that it functions just fine as an everyday knife, and as you can see by many celebrity chefs on tv, this style of knife is gaining many converts outside of the asian community now.
mind you, if you really prefer the profile of the traditional cook's knife, then by all means go with an 8" chef's knife if you're comfortable with that -- i'm sure you'll be pleased.
anthony bourdain recommends this style of knife, as does famous pastry chef sherry yard, and i keep seeing chefs on food network canada using offset serrated knives too (i just saw several on one night's episode of iron chef america for example).
everything ships from my montreal-area location, so there are no cross-border delays and headaches, no duty, brokerage fees, or service/warranty hassles!
if you like to prepare fresh fish and larger cuts of meat, be sure to also invest in a boning knife or fine fish fillet knife.
the 8" chef's knife is certainly still the best-selling size, but if you're a professional chef or culinary school student or if you already have a santoku and want something bigger to complement it, then it can make sense to move up to a 9" or 10" (or 240mm/9.5" in the case of japanese knives) chef's knife.
i do my best to offer the lowest prices i can, everyday (no need to wait for a "sale" like in the stores), with personal service and fast shipping: order by noon est and your order will shiptoday!
now that i've gotten used to the ceramic, well, i just like how consistent and gentle it is... read on... - ceramic honing rods: much has been said about ceramic and steel honing rods by ill-informed north-american japanese knife distributors and importers.
now, a ceramic rod does work, but you have to understand that a fine ceramic is very fine -- almost not abrasive at all, and japanese knife steel is normally harder than german knife steel, so you have to use it regularly (daily, or at least a few times a week), or else it simply won't do a darn thing.
a truly great knife, that i everyone is thrilled with.
your mileage may vary.
and if you want something really high-end with superb steel and incredible balance and the best construction quality, check out thetakayuki 63-layer and misono ux10 santoku and see why these are now my #1 best seller among professional chefs and serious home cooks.
- secondary knife: a small paring knife for fruit and vegetable peeling, paring, slicing and other small jobs, and a utility knife.
popular with men and women, it's great for just about any cooking style.
the misono long slicers are also superb, with the one wielded by tv's "top chef" being popular, and the sakai takayuki line offers a number of superb japanese slicers at quite reasonable prices.
a sharp edge cuts better than a dull edge (!), so it follows that a sharp knife is a better tool.
again, the wusthof are superb and constantly winning awards and "best bets" from major publications because they work well, they're rugged, and they're easy to maintain and sharpen -- a real no-brainer if you just want a no-nonsense knife to cook dinner with.
thetakayuki 5.3" utility knife is very good-looking and an excellent performer at a great price -- my #1 most popular such utility knife now, and very handy for smaller slicing/dicing jobs like onion, ginger and garlic.
basically, a sharp knife lets you concentrate on the job at hand, without worrying about putting tons of pressure on the blade or about ruining a delicate item you're trying to prepare.
these are very nice knives: sharp and durable and very well made with great fit and finish, at a truly fantastic price -- all-around great values without a doubt (don't let the affordable prices fool you!).
a good sharp knife is a good cutting tool, so let it do its job -- there should be no need (most of the time) to push down really hard, and this is especially true with a serrated edge, which is designed to cut just fine with gentle and steady pressure and movement, without hacking away!
thinner, sharper, harder steel, affordable: if you're thinking of trying a real japanese knife, i'd have no hestitation in recommending amisono molybdenum santoku or a sakai takayuki santoku.
or again, if you're thinking of trying a japanese knife because you want something lighter and thinner than a german knife but prefer a traditional shape, the misono molybdenum and ux10 chef's knives are light, strong, and an abolute pleasure to own and use.
this way your knife will stay sharp and won't need a serious re-sharpening by a pro or by some sharpening system.
with a butcher's steel can do wonders.
and remember, don't just push down; let the sharp edge do its job by using a nice steady slicing action.
a good knife blade is extremely strong when used vertically in a normal cutting motion, but with very hard steel sharpened to a fine edge (as it will be on most good japanese knives!), it could chip or could even snap if you try to use if for something like prying.
this is what you'll probably end up using 90% of the time in your everyday home or professional kitchen.
take your time, remembering to always keep your fingers of the guiding hand (not holding the knife) tucked inwards, away from the blade, and your thumb tucking in behind your fingers and not sticking out as most of us do without thinking!
mind you, if you really prefer the profile of the traditional cook's knife, then by all means go with an 8" chef's knife if you're comfortable with that -- i'm sure you'll be pleased.
i love the new classic ikon and would definitely choose that model if i had to pick one today.
again, the wusthof are superb and constantly winning awards and "best bets" from major publications because they work well, they're rugged, and they're easy to maintain and sharpen -- a real no-brainer if you just want a no-nonsense knife to cook dinner with.
similarly, a 4-5" "utility knife" is also a great second knife choice if you already have some paring knives that are doing the trick.
and again, if you do need to touch up your blade (which is normal), go slowly and avoid the theatrics of swiping the blade over the steel in a swash-buckling manner like you'll sometimes see tv chefs do when in full "performance" mode.
one thing: don't just jump in and hack away with your old coarse sharpening steel.
if you like the look and it's not much more money, then fine (i'll admin, they do look kind of cool!), but i wouldn't let dimples affect my decision on a particular knife purchase .
razor sharp and versatile -- a super choice for home cooks: trust me, you'll never go back to the old chef's knife style once you switch to a santoku and learn to appreciate the smaller size and increased versatility of the blade shape.
thetakayuki 5.3" utility knife is very good-looking and an excellent performer at a great price -- my #1 most popular such utility knife now, and very handy for smaller slicing/dicing jobs like onion, ginger and garlic.

update: as of 2009 i am now using my10" fine ceramic hone on all my knives and have all but retired my trusty old steel.
so get the best, sharpest knives you can afford, treat them with care, keep them sharp, and they should last you a lifetime.
that's why i prefer to sell bread knives that are at least 9" in length, which in my mind is the ideal size for home use.
secondary knife: a small paring knife for fruit and vegetable peeling, paring, slicing and other small jobs, and a utility knife.
one very sharp, very strong and very big serrated knife which makes a killer bread knife and yet isn't too expensive is thewusthof gourmet 10" confectioner's knife -- if you want a big serrated knife but don't want to spend the extra big money, this one is certainly a nice option (and it cuts like crazy).
yes, it's shorter, but in a way it's really a more versatile knife, capable of dealing with all kinds of breads and other crusty items, including roast meats, veggies, etc.
with the internet and cable network food shows, i could clearly see that both professionals and serious home cooks had moved beyond these old brands and were discovering real gems from around the world, both in terms of brands, and also in terms of styles, shapes, and overall design.
so keep in mind that a sharp knife is a safe knife, because it allows for more precise control and effortless slicing, chopping and cutting, resulting in fewer opportunities for slippage and accidental mishandling.
if you like the look and it's not much more money, then fine (i'll admin, they do look kind of cool!), but i wouldn't let dimples affect my decision on a particular knife purchase .
beautiful carbon steel blades, direct from japan.
in my opinion, the easiest way to do this is simply with a steel.
similarly, a 4-5" "utility knife" is also a great second knife choice if you already have some paring knives that are doing the trick.
i import knives direct from japan, so you're not paying another middle-man.
bread knife/roast knife: unless you're a dedicated sliced-bread person, every household should have a good bread knife.
andsakai takayuki 3.2" paring knives-- it's a knife you'll see professional chefs use a lot when they want something for preparing small or delicate items where a full-size chef's knife is overkill.
chinese cleavers / chef's knives wenger knives i used to find it frustrating to see the same low-end lines of "brand-name" knives and accessories at my local kitchen shops.
with the internet and cable network food shows, i could clearly see that both professionals and serious home cooks had moved beyond these old brands and were discovering real gems from around the world, both in terms of brands, and also in terms of styles, shapes, and overall design.
wusthof cook's models (all professional-level knives), or a 9.5" japanese knife, like the top-of-the-line misono ux10 or one of the many excellentsakai takayuki models.
and so i'm very proud and happy to make these incredible knives available to my fellow canadians at truly fair every-day discounted prices!
the added length and curve of the blade can be very comfortable if you're used to the traditional "rocking" motion.
so if you have a japanese or other knife with a similar polished edge (the misono japanese knives have polished edges), then a ceramic is a good choice.
in terms of care, try to wash your knife as soon as possible after use (never leave it in a sink with dirty dishes), dry it and then put it back safely in a proper knife block or magnetic strip, and not in a drawer where it'll bang around or where someone could stick their hand in by accident.
even more savings on many best-selling knives.
they were designed for thin slicers, but manufacturers put them on everything now because they look cool and help sell knives.
you don't need the fancy handle of the more expensive models -- this one works just fine, and the nice 10" length means it's big enough to sharpen even a serious chef's knife blade easily.
home :: knife information knife information discount canadian prices, great service & fast shipping from canada on top-rated knives from around the world i work hard to bring in the best knives i can find, so my fellow canadians can have easy access to high quality knives and accessories from around the world.
this is the same sort of steel included in all "sets" and in 99% of the kitchen stores out there, but in a more versatile 10" length for sharpening longer chef's knives.

, or if you want the control and quality that only a stone and hand sharpening can give you, go forjapanese water stones, or for a stone-style edge but with ultimate angle control, the stone-basededge pro system gives you the quality and control of hand sharpening on a stone, combined with the control over angles of a machine (this is also the best choice if you have both japanese and german knives, since you can change the angle).
this might have been fine to restore some semblance of an edge on your old knives, but it can seriously junk the razor-sharp and precisely-ground edge on your new japanese knife, so don't just go at it, and don't let your well-meaning friend or family member (why does it always seem to be a brother-in-law?!?)
now, a ceramic rod does work, but you have to understand that a fine ceramic is very fine -- almost not abrasive at all, and japanese knife steel is normally harder than german knife steel, so you have to use it regularly (daily, or at least a few times a week), or else it simply won't do a darn thing.
the slicers and bread knives i sell are all fine for the job, with nice thin and sharp blades, which make short work of crusty bread or meats.
fact: dimples do not reduce "suction" and "sticking" like some people and sellers claim -- it's really just about reducing friction: since there is less material for the food to contact with as it passes the cutting edge, theoretically you should be able to get paper thin slices a bit more easily.
take your time, remembering to always keep your fingers of the guiding hand (not holding the knife) tucked inwards, away from the blade, and your thumb tucking in behind your fingers and not sticking out as most of us do without thinking!
or for the more standard "carving knives" like we're all used to, check out the fine wusthof models.
if you like to prepare fresh fish and larger cuts of meat, be sure to also invest in a boning knife or fine fish fillet knife.
paul's knife hints & tips remember, a knife is a tool designed for cutting.
hardest steel, super sharp, best looks and performance:
- you know, if you don't already have a good steel, before you do anything else, go ahead and get one like the standard high qualitywusthof steel, good for just about any knife out there (except serrated knifes, which should be sharpened by a professional).
you should actually give your knife a few light strokes on the steel once a week (or every few days even).
i personally think that some knives with a ground edge (most german knives) can keep that nice "bite" in their edge better with a traditional steel (metal), but the difference can be subtle.
and remember, don't just push down; let the sharp edge do its job by using a nice steady slicing action.
mind you, i also use a steel on global and other knives, and it works fine for me (with a gentle touch!).

or if you're in love with the idea of a granton edge (dimples) japanese knife and want something really nice without breaking the bank, the sakai takayuki (8.3" or 9.5") are fantastic and a great value (they're made with excellent and hard steel, and very durable handles).
price comparisons: i try to be as competitive as possible with suppliers outside of canada.
that's really too small to be useful for slicing larger loaves or artisan-bakery bread, or even for doing pretty common baking jobs like slicing cake layers.
don't put tons of pressure on the blade.

then the "offset serrated" knife is a great option.
or again, if you're thinking of trying a japanese knife because you want something lighter and thinner than a german knife but prefer a traditional shape, the misono molybdenum and ux10 chef's knives are light, strong, and an abolute pleasure to own and use.
again, the japananese misono molybdenum utility/petty knives are really nice, and different in shape than a wusthof utility knife, in that they are shaped more like mini chef's knives rather than large paring knives -- not that one is necessarily better than the other, but it's something to think about.
okay, back to ceramic: i was tired of the small and cheap junk sold by the north american japanese knife distributors, so i sought out a quality manufacturer and imported them directly.
but a good chef just needs a good sharp knife and a little practice to get precise and thin slices, not gimmicks.
so keep in mind that a sharp knife is a safe knife, because it allows for more precise control and effortless slicing, chopping and cutting, resulting in fewer opportunities for slippage and accidental mishandling.
slicer (also called carving knife): if you like to purchase and prepare larger cuts of meat yourself (whole chickens, etc.), then a slicer/carving knife is a great knife to have.
all in all, a thin-bladed serrated slicer is an incredibly useful tool to have around the kitchen.
this is what you'll probably end up using 90% of the time in your everyday home or professional kitchen.
otherwise, the most popular traditional "bread knife" i sell is thewusthof classic 9" (forged, very nice, very strong, perfect length; also available in theother handle styles).
