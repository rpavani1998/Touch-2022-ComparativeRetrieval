any knife, whether stainless steel or ceramic, will potentially break at the tip if its dropped on a hard surface at a certain angle.ceramic is harder than all metals, so it is the ideal surface to re-sharpen these softer materials.the ceramic sharpeners are used to sharpen all steel-based knives, including titanium because the same hardness principle applies.these knives are made of an advanced, high-tech ceramic called zirconium oxide (also called zirconia).a black (hip) blade is made out of a black zirconium oxide and offers extra durability.even so, ceramic knives are intended to complement -- not replace -- your other cutlery.this type of blade goes through an extra firing process called a "hot-isostatic press," creating a tighter weave between the ceramic molecules, thus creating a tougher blade.unfortunately, accidental damage can occur so we do offer resharpening services.unfortunately, accidental damage can occur so we do offerÂ resharpening services.finally, ceramic knives are very easy to clean with a hand washing or mild bleach solution (blade only).these scissors are made of an advanced, high-tech ceramic called zirconium oxide (also called zirconia).this material, which is second in hardness only to diamond, was originally developed for industrial applications where metal components failed.you can also damage ceramic scissors by trying to cut very thick material or by trying to bend the blades.it's a great at-home solution to refreshen and resharpen kyocera blades.for slicing fruits, vegetables and boneless meats, a kyocera advanced ceramic knife has no equal.
