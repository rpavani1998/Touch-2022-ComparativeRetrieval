blunt knives require more force, and more force means less control – particularly if you slip.keeping your kitchen knives sharp is one of those jobs where a little bit of effort every now and again saves a lot of trouble in the long run.a safer way (and easier, if you’re unused to honing knives) is to place a towel on your worktop or kitchen table and (using your non-knife wielding hand) hold the steel in front of you with the tip firmly on the towel, pointing straight downwards.a safer way (and easier, if you’re unused to honing knives) is to place a towel on your worktop or kitchen table and (using your non-knife wielding hand) hold the steel in front of you with the tip firmly on the towel,while you can do it that way – and many professionals do – it’s difficult, and involves a certain amount of risk that you’ll cut yourself if your attention wanders.with a bit of practice, you’ll soon have it down to a fine art – and you’ll find your cooking becomes more enjoyable as a result.it takes a lot more effort to cut food using a blunt knife than it does with a sharp one.but it’s not recommended and it’s quite an easy way to give yourself a nasty cut if you’re not careful.the diamond and ceramic steels last longer, but they’re for sharpening rather than honing.this also explains why it’s best to have a really sharp knife when chopping onions – the sharper the knife, the less you cry.i am a quick learner and only cut myself once in my early days, not using the steel but testing the blade the wrong way after honing it.our knives regularly enough, you’ve just motivated me to do something about it.when i worked in a professional kitchen, i used the steel every day before using any knife for work.showing off is something i never give thought to as i’ve been using a steel so long it’s of a second nature to me, thinking back to last christmas though and the grandchildren’s faces has just made me laugh, i must have looked like a samurai warrior.that force gets spread more widely throughout the food, bruising it around the cut.
