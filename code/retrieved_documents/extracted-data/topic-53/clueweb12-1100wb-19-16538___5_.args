you can get what's called an "arkansas stone", which is sold in fine knife stores; an arkansas stone is typically used after a regular stone when sharpening knives because it is very fine-grained and applies a very smooth finish to the cutting edge.what's important here is that it have a razor-sharp edge; a sharp edge is essential to make your gouge better rather than worse when sharpening.the problem with these things is that they typically have rows of holes all over the surface, which may help sharpening knives somehow but it just causes grief honing gouges.the cutting edge on a gouge nib needs to have comparatively blunt angles to be strong enough to push into rubber and pry pieces out without getting damaged.if you can't find a ceramic knife the only possible substitute known is a flexcut slipstrop, which is a honing kit designed specifically for sharpening carving tools.i haven't used one, but i understand they are made of wood and use a fine rouge or polishing compound to provide a cutting action.i have tried both ways, with a flat bottom and with a rounded bottom, and in my opinion the flat bottom works as well or even slightly better; the gouge has less tendency to fall into the groove you just cut.it's probably cheaper and easier to buy the ceramic knife, since it'll last essentially forever -- and if it does get dull, you can sharpen it with a diamond hone (but not an arkansas stone; rub your ceramic knife against an arkansas stone and the stone loses!).you will need a very fine knife hone; a common "knife sharpening stone" won't do, they are usually far too coarse for this job even if they have a side described as "fine".for one thing, if you're using a powered grinder, you'll most certainly burn the metal; the thinner the edge gets, the easier it is to overheat it.if the wood in the slipstrop has a sharp edge that'll be good, but if that edge gets dull with use you're either going to have to figure out how to sharpen it or keep buying new slipstrops every now and then.these cuts do not affect the cutting edge at all; the cutting edge is not involved -- that's why it doesn't matter if you use the hone or grinder.if you choose to use sandpaper, be sure to pull your gouge across the sandpaper rather than push it; pushing can cause the sandpaper to curl up a bit just ahead of the gouge and dull it rather than sharpen it.even if it doesn't permanently deform it, it can bend it enough that the hone isn't creating the edge you're looking for; it's not polishing the edge itself because the edge has moved out of the way.if you honed a knife at similar angles, it would end up with a pretty blunt edge indeed and wouldn't cut well at all.
