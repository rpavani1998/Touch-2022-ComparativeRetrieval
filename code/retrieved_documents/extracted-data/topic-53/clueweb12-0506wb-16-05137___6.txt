the bad things are that they are fragile and need special treatment.
they stick less to food; they are corrosion proof; they are harder than metal knives and so stay sharp longer; they won't add metalic flavor to food; they don't react with foods such as lettuce and accelerate the browning of the food.

i was supposed to be amazed at how sharp it was and how long it held its edge.
disadvantages: can't sharpen at home when they do get dull; more brittle than are metal knives (but they are stronger than many people think); not as sharp as some of my steel knives, but sharp enough for most slicing jobs.
more is more and more is fabulous.
