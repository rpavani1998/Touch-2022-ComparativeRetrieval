diamond steels do actually sharpen some of the edge, and they do hone too, so they too have some advantages.many hone their knives before each use - why - because it keeps their knives sharper, longer.it seems to slice very well, but it's a little disconcerting, since i think they're more fragile than steel knives.you really put my mind at ease and i can now enjoy my new knives without worry.my hands are big and my grip firm, so i have not found them to be so comfortable, but have had students with small hands that swear by them.for cutting vegetables and fish, they're awesome, but for tougher work, they feel too fragile.if you use your knife a lot every day, then honing everyday is the absolute best thing you can do.i damaged some nerves in my right hand years ago and have switched over to using my left hand for many different maneuvers, including transitioning knife chopping duties over to my left and using the right hand as the guide.for the past 18 years i have cut everything with meat scissors or forced my husband to do it.he's even agreed to buy me a good chef's knife after i prove i am going to try to use it instead of wimping out and going back to my old habits.in the past, i could not figure out how to hold things down and feel that they were secure enough for me to chop away with confidence that i won't be bleeding into my pile of vegetables and what-not.sharpening creates an edge once it's lost from use.this guy that is going to do my knives does all the commercial hotels and restaurants around town and says that once i see what he can do with my knives that i won't want to use a steel, i'll just pay the $3 that he charges to get them resharpened.and every knife will begin to lose it's edge with use over time.i found this particularly usefull as i quite often switch hands while cooking, being ambidextrous has it's advantages at times.. :-) - paul how worried should i be about honing my knife with a steel?
