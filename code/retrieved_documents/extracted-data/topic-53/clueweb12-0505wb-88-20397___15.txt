the edge pro is a nice system, if you have a number of knives to sharpen.
my brother has a knife branded by edward don that looks exactly like the sanelli right down to the two-tone coloration except that it's gray with red accents.
by creating the premana professional collection, the aim of coltellerie sanelli s.p.a. is to make a decisive contribution to improving safety, reliability and hygiene at work.
i looked online to see what the recommended for sharpening and they said you should only sharpen it twice a year!

the cutting edge runs to the bolster.
it should not be a problem to find, a chef knife with kullens.
the plastic "bolster", or rather the front end of the handle, is very, very thick and molded at about a 45 degree angle.
this criticism can be made for most western knives, because of the bolster.

edge shape especially designed for professional use.
the exclusive ergonomic handle design is the result of special studies carried out at qualified university institutes (a research unit named epm: ergonomics of posture and movement at the milan polytechnic) and tested by computerized experimental tests.
i've used it for 4 months now, and it is still amazingly sharp.
the steel in japanese knives is harder then those typically found in european knives.
the convex shape of the edge guarantees an efficient support when the user has to exert considerable force.
knife makers put grantons or kullens on numerous styles of knives.
the material used will resist sudden temperature changes (from -40°c to +150°c), corrosive agents and detergents.
and they should be avoided if you know what you're doing.
however, i just can't get comfortable with the flat edge.

but until you've seen that knife i don't thing you really "get" just  how fat the handle is.
i believe  there are also sharpeners you can buy to make the same angle.

the thing i can't figure out is how the heck you can  sharpen all the way to the heel.

not sure that would make a difference.
if you only have the shun, then sending it out, makes more sense.
the knife is made of 440 steel hardened to 52-54 r. 440 is not the best grade of steel, and 52 is pretty soft.

the soft, but slightly  rough surface makes the handle non-slip and much safer to use.
all "traditional" euro-style knives with a bolster are fatally flawedre sharpening the 1/4" in front of the bolster.
to compensate makers will sandwich or clad the hard steel, between soft steel.
but if you have to cut corners you can  at least get the best of an inferior breed.
the steel is folded so well it wont dull if you use a good cutting board.
all times are gmt -5.
the plastic "bolster", or rather the  front end of the handle, is very, very thick and molded at about a 45 degree  angle.
the 45 degree bolster would get in the way when using the knife to its outer limits of length, i.e halving a melon, and a with the bolster shape and materiel, would be difficult to sharpen without damaging the bolster.

jan 2008  location: richmond, va  posts: 937  after looking at the  specs, design, and price of this knife, it seems to me to have very little to  offer.
kanetsune and shun steels are very similar.
in short, these are the salient properties of the premana professional collection: blades resistant hardness (54-56 hrc).
the soft, but slightly rough surface makes the handle non-slip and much safer to use.
all in all, for my purposes and for the price, i think you would be better off with a commercial grade forschner or dexter, or a german henkels or wusthoff, or for a little more, a japanese vg 10 blade.
the shape of the handle was designed at the computer.
the part about the folding steel or doing it so well, makes a knife with good retention, in general isn't true.
the exclusive ergonomic handle design is  the result of special studies carried out at qualified university institutes (a  research unit named epm: ergonomics of posture and movement at the milan  polytechnic) and tested by computerized experimental tests.
is your  recommendation then to pick up a stamped steel knife such as a forschner?
if you're a  little bit more serious than most, but don't want to spend enough to get a  japanese knife, get a sab.
if we're not supposed to eat animals, then how come  they're made out of meat?
just make sure whoever you send the knife to, is familiar with japanese steel and shuns.
my brother has a knife branded by edward don that looks exactly like the  sanelli right down to the two-tone coloration except that it's gray with red  accents.
this means that the knife can be cleaned in a dishwasher and sterilized.
