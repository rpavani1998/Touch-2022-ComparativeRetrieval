if you aren't interested in having to maintain your blades, kyocera ceramic knives are a great option, as the non-porous material doesn't dull like steel.they're inexpensive and seriously come in handy.you'll find you have little use for much else and don't have to replace things as often, if at all, when you invest in a few quality items.the big drawback of ceramic is that they're a bit delicate.they do require a bit of extra care to maintain the "seasoning" that keeps them non-stick, but trust me, it's worth it.it works amazing and you can control the slice thickness with an exterior switch instead of the hassle of taking it apart.you'll save yourself time, effort, money in the long run, and yourself from possible trips to the emergency room.good quality kitchen knives even if you only purchase a chef's knife and paring knife, please buy good quality blades.they work best for browning, frying, camp cooking, and pretty much anything else you'd use a skillet for.i use it for sauces, dips, dough, chopping, mincing, slicing, and blending.you can also find them at second hand stores, if you don't mind the extra work of re-seasoning them.their sharpeners are set to hone the edge to the specific angle of their knives.using a sharpener from a different company will offset your blade.i use mine for steaming homemade seitan, savory and sweet dumplings, and for quick and easy steamed veggies on nights when i'm not in a cooking mood.i also suggest some heavy duty baking sheets and pans, a silicone collapsible strainer, a counter top compost bin, and a good quality blender.
