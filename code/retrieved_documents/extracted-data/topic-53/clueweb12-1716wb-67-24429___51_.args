in addition, many modern steels perform so well, that knife decisions can often be made based on other factors than marginal increases in steel performance.the combination of great wear resistance, almost-stainlessness, and good toughness make it a great choice for a number of knife styles.these steels provide a high-end performance benchmark for stainless steels, and hold an edge well, and are tough enough for many uses (though not on par with good non-stainlesses).they can be hardened more than the previous group, for better strength, and they are more wear resistant, though wear resistance is just getting to the point of acceptability.if a weak, brittle steel can perform the job when sharpened at 25-degrees-per-side, a strong, tough steel might give you some marginal performance improvements if it, too, is sharpened at 25-degrees-per-side.these cobalt alloys have incredible wear resistance, and are practically corrosion resistant.all 3 steels have some vanadium added (which the 440 series lacks), which will improve wear resistance and refines the grain for both good toughness, and the ability to sharpen to a very keen edge.as the knifemaker moves from one steel to another, it is often possible to modify the design of a particular knife to take advantage of the newer steel, and raise performance.it has good wear resistance, but is known especially for its outstanding toughness.toughness is obviously important in jobs such as chopping, but it's also important any time the blade hits harder impurities in a material being cut (e.g., cardboard, which often has embedded impurities).this material is tough and has great wear resistance, but is relatively weak.because of choosing the right sharpening angle, the more expensive s30v knife now gives an impressive return on investment.it is wear resistant to the point where it can be difficult to sharpen.in addition, some types of materials are acidic (e.g., some types of foods), and micro-oxidation can lead to edge loss at the very tip of the edge, over a small amount of time.so, the next general rule: knowing the uses you'll put your knife to, and exactly how those uses cause edge degradation, will allow you to make a much better choice of steel, if you generally understand steel properties.
