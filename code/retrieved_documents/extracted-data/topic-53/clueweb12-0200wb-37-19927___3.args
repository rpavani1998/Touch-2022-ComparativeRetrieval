finally, ceramic knives are very easy to clean with a hand washing or mild bleach solution (blade only).
the ceramic sharpeners are used to sharpen all steel-based knives, including titanium because the same hardness principle applies.
the white ceramic blade is also made out of zirconium oxide but does not go through this expensive sintering process.
this material, which is second in hardness only to diamond, was originally developed for industrial applications where metal components failed.
first, you can chip the edge if you cut into bones.
use steel knives for carving, prying, boning, cutting frozen foods, and slicing cheese.
you can resharpen your ceramic knife by using our resharpening service.
these knives are made of an advanced, high-tech ceramic called zirconium oxide (also called zirconia).
these scissors are made of an advanced, high-tech ceramic called zirconium oxide (also called zirconia).
first, it's dangerous if someone forgets about the knife or reaches in the wrong way.
ceramic is harder than all metals, so it is the ideal surface to re-sharpen these softer materials.
to check for the nearest retailer, go to where to buy.
it's a great at-home solution to refreshen and resharpen kyocera blades.
always use them on a plastic or wood cutting board and avoid cutting on marble, stone or inappropriate surfaces like plates or kitchen tile.
you can store your kyocera ceramic knife in a conventional knife block, in an in-drawer tray, or in the package.
second, you can break off the tip or snap off the handle if you use it to pry or twist.

for slicing fruits, vegetables and boneless meats, a kyocera advanced ceramic knife has no equal.
only kyocera advanced ceramic knives can be sharpened with this service.
this type of blade goes through an extra firing process called a "hot-isostatic press," creating a tighter weave between the ceramic molecules, thus creating a tougher blade.
second, violent motion against other objects, especially hard plates, could chip the objects and/or the knife.
even so, ceramic knives are intended to complement -- not replace -- your other cutlery.

you can also damage ceramic scissors by trying to cut very thick material or by trying to bend the blades.
a black (hip) blade is made out of a black zirconium oxide and offers extra durability.
third, dishwashers ruin wood handles.
any knife, whether stainless steel or ceramic, will potentially break at the tip if its dropped on a hard surface at a certain angle.
for the technically minded, zirconium oxide has a hardness of 8.2 mohs (vs. steel at 5-6 mohs and diamond at 10 mohs).
use steel knives for carving, prying, boning, cutting frozen foods, and slicing cheese.
these scissors are made of an advanced, high-tech ceramic called zirconium oxide (also called zirconia).
zirconium oxide is extremely hard, wear resistant, and chemically inert.
unfortunately, accidental damage can occur so we do offer resharpening services.

ceramic blades are strong, but not flexible.
this type of blade goes through an extra firing process called a "hot-isostatic press," creating a tighter weave between the ceramic molecules, thus creating a tougher blade.

like forged steel scissors, however, you can break the tip if the scissors land on the tip (very uncommon).
