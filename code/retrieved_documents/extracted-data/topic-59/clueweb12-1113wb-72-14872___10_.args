adults should also supervise children when skiing or snowboarding, especially beginners, and make sure that young skiers who are not able to read are familiar with trail signs and their color-coding to prevent going down a trail too difficult for them.young children are of special concern since their motor skills have not yet fully developed, making it harder to react quickly in an emergency situation.every resort has a ski patrol to make sure everyone is following the rules and to aid anyone who is injured.while this is not required yet, it can help lower the risk of head injury, should you fall in hard, icy conditions or lose control in wooded areas.remember that skiing and snowboarding can be exciting and fun, but make sure you follow the rules and use common sense when participating in these sports.even advanced skiers would be wise to "brush up" on their skills with occasional lessons, especially when going on the first trip of every season.young children just learning how to skate may want to wear a helmet to avoid head injury - a hockey or bike helmet, etc. - since falls are common.it is always good to have new skiers/snowboarders go for professional lessons, which are often offered in package deals when renting ski equipment at the resort/mountain.this alerts the patrol, as well as other skiers, that someone is in trouble and needs immediate medical assistance.skates that are too big or small can cause falls and other injuries.by following all these rules, you should be able to avoid most injuries, however, sometimes accidents do occur.most outdoor accidental injuries happen during the winter season.many ski shops or resorts offer equipment inspections and "tune-ups," to make sure every nut and bolt is working properly.a lake or pond must have at least three inches of ice on top before it is safe to skate on for fun or sport.check with your local parks or recreation office for designated sledding areas in your town, to further ensure a safe path when sledding.
