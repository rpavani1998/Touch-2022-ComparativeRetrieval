foot orthoses nearly always can be made to make the skier more efficient since the foot orthosis can be used to optimize the foot-boot sole interface to allow more efficient weight transfer between the medial foot to the ski.however, many ski shops don't like doing this because it may alter the release mechanism of the binding which may increase the liability of the ski shop if an injury occurs with the canted binding.the force that the snow exerts on the ski, orsnow reaction force (srf) will bend the ski, which, along with the frontal plane angle of the ski relative to the snow surface, will help generate the forces necessary to allow the skier to make a turn.by joining ourfree global community of podiatrists and other interested foot health care professionals you will have access to post podiatry topics (answer and ask questions), communicate privately with other members (pm), upload content, view attachments, receive a weekly email update of new discussions,earn cpd points and access many other special features.because of this lean, the skier's legs will naturally have an angulation with the snow surface in order to counteract the effects of the centripetal force from the turn.most of these feet will have difficulty initiating and maintaining a ski turn since, in order to generate sufficient srf on the medial edge of the ski, they must internally rotate and adduct their knee excessively to try to get their medial forefoot to generate enough force on the boot bottom.basically, in order to be an effective alpine skier, the individual must be able to generate force between the medial edge of the downhill ski and the snow surface.the best "natural" alpine skiers tend to have rigid forefoot valgus type feet or, another way of saying this, is that their foot have increased medial column dorsiflexion stiffness.in 17 years of working with skiers of all levels from novice to world cup racers casting in a neutral postion with an orthoses designed for skiers has always worked for me alpine (downhill) skiing is a very interesting sport when it comes to the function of the foot.and any time i used a lab built orthoses the best successes have been with full forefoot correction and a narrow grind, never the less i still see clients with some massively over sized orthotics from their doctor to put into ski boots, as a plea to these doctors please either learn to understand the biomechanics and fit of a ski boot or reffer your patients to someone who does.biomechanics, sports and foot orthoses foot orthoses and skiing welcome to thepodiatry arena forums, for communication between foot health professionals about podiatry and related topics.firm medial forefoot force transmitted to the boot, binding and then to the medial edge of the ski is necessary to initiate and hold an edge during a alpine ski turn.one of the worst types of feet for alpine skiiing are those that have "overflexible" medial columns where the medial forefoot will simply dorsiflex with increasing plantar force acting on it (i.e. low medial column dorsiflexion stiffness).when making a ski turn, the skier must lean into toward the center of the turn's radius in order to keep their center of mass (com) in line with the srf vector.along with some of my skier students, we also did some preliminary research on ski biomechanics during my biomechanics fellowship.
