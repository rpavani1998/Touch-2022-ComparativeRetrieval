snow can be extremely unstable, often leading to avalanches.free ride snowboarding, where the focus is on riding cleanly and enjoying the freedom to go and explore anywhere is influenced significantly bysurfing.freestyle snowboarders typically use shorter boards and softer boots than other snowboarders, as the shorter board length reduces the weight andmoment of inertia, making it easier to spin and maneuver, and the softer boots make the board more forgiving to control for the particular demands of freestyle riding, such as slower speeds, high landing impacts, quick turns, and imperfect landings.powder also makes for softer landings and reduced chances of injury compared to man made terrain parks, though landing in deep snow can take some practice.the hard plastic boots stiffens the ankle joint up significantly, making it more difficult to make small ankle adjustments while making skid turns, but making the board much more stable and powerful at higher speeds and the much higherg-forces typically felt by an alpine snowboarder in carved turns.other risks with skiing or snowboarding in powder includeavalanches, injuries when falling on hidden obstacles such as rocks or tree stumps snowed over, loss of equipment, and the difficulty of getting oneself out of deep powder snow after a fall.without a split-board, snowboarders who want to experience backcountry terrain, bear a little extra burden by carrying their snowboards with a backpack and using snowshoes or cross country skis to ascend.backcountry riders are advised to take extreme caution in all conditions, to carry avalanche equipment including a probe, beacon, and shovel, and never to ride alone in the backcountry.the free riding is mostly for periods of relaxation, due to the relative "calmness" one feels going down a slope at one's own speed.softer boots and boards also allow riders more flexibility in body movement and the ability to reach very convoluted or stretched out, stylish body positions (known astweaks).powder is known as being the most fun and challenging condition for skiing and snowboarding, solely because it is so soft.most snowboarders aspire to be free riders and will explore the mountain through trees, in powder bowls or anywhere else they feel comfortable riding.this is exceptionally frustrating since it slows the board down rapidly, and if it is hit at high speed, a fall usually occurs.free riding is using the natural terrain of the mountain for recreation, without focusing on technical tricks or racing.as on a free ride board, this can make turn initiation more forgiving and help float the tip in powder and variable snow.
