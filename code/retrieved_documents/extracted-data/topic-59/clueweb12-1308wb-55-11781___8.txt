some freestyle snowboards are true twins, with the side cut radius being equal on both rails of the board and the stance centered on the board.
powder makes for much smoother turns and smoother riding.
snowboarding in deep powder snow doesn't actually require a sharply tuned edge at all as there is nothing to 'grip' in the lightly compacted snow.
many free ride purists attach an almostspiritual connotation to carving down  the mountain.

many ski  resorts operate terrain parks which often simulate the urban skateboard  environment, complete withhalf pipes, handrails, boxes, and machine-formed  jumps.
if powder snow sits undisturbed for too long it may become compacted and hard, sometimes icy.
alpine boards are usually, but not always, longer and much stiffer than free ride boards, as the particular demands of carving usually require as much usable edge length as possible.
some  freestyle snowboards are true twins, with the side cut radius being equal on  both rails of the board and the stance centered on the board.
powder is best to ride when it is fresh, before other riders "track it out" and make ruts in the smooth surface.
this is considered more difficult  terrain to negotiate.
riding a twin-tip board makes it easier to land switch and compensate for changing riding conditions.
courses in avalanche safety are also available.
in places where almost all of the runs are groomed, and powder is a rare  find, you must venture into the tree trails.
backcountry this type of boarding started out with fresh powder-craving snowboarders  who, most likely, didn't have the cash to spend at crowded upscale ski parks.
powder also makes for softer landings and reduced  chances of injury compared to man made terrain parks, though landing in deep  snow can take some practice.
an analogy made by some alpine enthusiasts is that free ride and freestyle snowboards are like dirt bikes, and alpine/carving snowboards are like road bikes.
freestyle snowboarding is arguably the most popular discipline, and is certainly the focus of most of thelifestyle marketing in the snowboarding industry.
softer boots and boards also allow riders more flexibility in body movement and the ability to reach very convoluted or stretched out, stylish body positions (known astweaks).
softer boards allow the snowboarder to press, or  butter, with ease, but many freestyle snowboarders, especially half pipe  riders, use stiff boards that have a lot of "pop" to allow them to  jump higher and absorb hard landings.
also in the early 1980s, films bywarren miller and greg stump began to feature clips of snowboarders, boosting the popularity of the sport among the skiing community.
the hard plastic boots stiffens the ankle joint up significantly, making it more difficult to make small ankle adjustments while making skid turns, but making the board much more stable and powerful at higher speeds and the much higherg-forces typically felt by an alpine snowboarder in carved turns.

powder is known as being the most fun and challenging condition for skiing and snowboarding, solely because it is so soft.
without a  split-board, snowboarders who want to experience backcountry terrain, bear a  little extra burden by carrying their snowboards with a backpack and using  snowshoes or cross country skis to ascend.
powder is best to ride when it is fresh, before  other riders "track it out" and make ruts in the smooth surface.
there are four primary sub-disciplines or sub-styles within snowboarding  with each favoring a slightly differentsnowboard design.
(hence riding a freestyle snowboard on groomed slopes is like riding a  dirt bike on a road track or what is calledsupermoto.)
alpine riders use hard plastic snowboarding boots, which resemble ski boots, except that they tend to be less stiff in the ankles and have a shortened heel, to minimize hanging over the edge of the snowboard.
freestyle snowboarding is arguably the most popular discipline, and is  certainly the focus of most of thelifestyle marketing in the snowboarding  industry.
free riding is also known as all-mountain snowboarding.
some of those more cash-endowed  riders can even hire snowcats or helicopters to take them where they want to  go; this is known as cat boarding or heliboarding respectively.
tricks can either occur on the ground (e.g. jibbing, bonking, grinding, pressing, buttering etc.) or in the air (e.g. spins, flips, grabs).
most snowboarders aspire to be  free riders and will explore the mountain through trees, in powder bowls or  anywhere else they feel comfortable riding.
often snowboarders use snowmobiles to make jumps into the powder.
however, it is preferred to have a tuned effective edge in case the terrain  suddenly changes and grip is required.
in places where almost all of the runs are groomed, and powder is a rare find, you must venture into the tree trails.
freestyle snowboarders often 'detune' or dull the edges of their snowboards  so as not to catch them on rails or boxes when jibbing.
jake is the founder of burton snowboards, one of the largest and most well-established snowboard companies in the world.
alpine snowboarding is the practice of turning by carving the snowboard (such that the board turns by using the radius side cut of the edge), as opposed to skidding the snowboard (where the board is traveling in a different direction than it is pointing).

a split-board is a snowboard cut in half along its length.
when apart, the two halves can be used likecross-country skis to ascend a hill.
today, backcountry snowboarding is often for those who have  enough cash to afford trips to alaska or the mountain ranges of the west, to  ride outside resorts.
softer boots and boards also allow riders more flexibility in body  movement and the ability to reach very convoluted or stretched out, stylish  body positions (known astweaks).
when the snowboarder is ready to descend, the halves are mechanically secured together, and thebindings are repositioned for a snowboarding stance.

most freestyle boards are directional, in that the tip is typically softer than the tail, and with the bindings and center of the side cut located slightly aft of center.
the powder snow will hold consistency if the temperature stays as cold or colder than when the snow fell, however when the sun melts it the so called "slush" is formed.
snowboarding in deep powder snow doesn't actually require a sharply tuned  edge at all as there is nothing to 'grip' in the lightly compacted snow.
free ride snowboarding, where the focus is on riding cleanly and enjoying the freedom to go and explore anywhere is influenced significantly bysurfing.
in fact, before snowboarding was allowed at resorts, this was the only form of  snowboarding;jake burton, one of the original pioneers of snowboarding, never  even considered resorts; backcountry was what he envisioned as the future of  snowboarding.
other risks with skiing or snowboarding in powder includeavalanches, injuries when falling on hidden obstacles such as rocks or tree stumps snowed over, loss of equipment, and the difficulty of getting oneself out of deep powder snow after a fall.

freestyle snowboarding is the practice of doing different kinds of tricks on a snowboard, hence the name freestyle.
as on a free ride board, this can make turn initiation more forgiving and help float the tip in powder and variable snow.
freestyle snowboarders typically use shorter boards and  softer boots than other snowboarders, as the shorter board length reduces the  weight andmoment of inertia, making it easier to spin and maneuver, and the  softer boots make the board more forgiving to control for the particular  demands of freestyle riding, such as slower speeds, high landing impacts, quick  turns, and imperfect landings.
