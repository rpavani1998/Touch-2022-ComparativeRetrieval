australia gavin watt wrote (on the rec.skiing.nordic group):  the main nordic skiing sites in australia are the victorian high country resorts of falls creek (where thekangaroo hoppet race is held in late august), mount hotham (they also have a biathlon range), lake mountain and in new south wales, perisher blue.
perhaps the problem is that dramatic peaks are surrounded by steep slopes which are not appropriate for cross-country ski trails -- so might want to be prepared to rent snowshoes to hike to, or ride a mechnical lift up to see bigger views (but then also make inquiries about avalanche danger).
see ski info - story1 but lots of the trails i skied in norway did not have so many interesting curves + fun dips + rolls as favorite ski centers in france and italy (though not so different from average trails in france + italy).

in addition to race camps, they've been holding actual elite races here before the end of november.
i assume there must be more interesting fun ski trails in norway, so if it's important to you to ski that sort of style, i'd suggest do some more specific research in advance, rather than assuming you'll find it on the obvious trails at the obvious places.
in the northern alps, we like: la féclaz for wonderfully fun trails; les saisies for hillier fun trail design, views of big mountains, late-season snow; bessans for gentle trails amidst dramatic mountains with late-season snow.
