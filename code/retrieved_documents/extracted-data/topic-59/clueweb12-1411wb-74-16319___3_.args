therefore, if twice as many people ski and snowboard than play hockey in canada, then the two activities have similar rates of injury.excluding motor vehicle collisions, falls on ice were the most common cause of hospital visits in winter, accounting for 7,138 in the 2010/11 season.of course, few people are performing 1080s on a superpipe, but downhill activities are one of the main causes for hospital stays, according to data released last week from the canadian institute for health information.the vast majority of snowmobile injuries - 752 of 1,126 - involved adults 20-49.about twice as many injuries result from skiing and snowboarding than hockey each year, according to a study released last week.women accounted for 56 per cent of those hospitalized from falls on ice.last winter, skiing and snowboarding accounted for 2,329 hospital visits, for one night or longer, in canada.without question, it reduces the risk of serious head injuries in case of a crash.”last year 135 head injuries from skiing and snowboarding were reported.staying off the slopes, ice rink, snowmobiles and toboggans does not remove the dangers involved with snow and ice.“wearing a helmet is important for all ages to prevent a fun day in the snow from ending in tragedy.“there is a lot to enjoy about canadian winters, but safety and precautions are important across all age groups,” said greg webster, director of primary health-care information and clinical registries at the institute, in a media release.“when it comes to winter, it’s important that canadians get outside to play and enjoy our slopes,” said dr. natalie yanchar, associate professor of surgery and emergency medicine at dalhousie university and medical director at iwk trauma care in halifax, in the release.the sidewalk can be just as dangerous, according to the study.“these numbers do not include visits that involve only the emergency department or a doctor’s office or deaths at the scene, so the total number of injuries is actually much higher.”
