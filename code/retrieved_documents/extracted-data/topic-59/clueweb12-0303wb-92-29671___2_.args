skiing and snowboarding can be risky and injuries are common, even for the most experienced riders.ski resorts are often held liable for all winter sports activities within their boundaries and so they take time to make sure the runs are groomed, the instructors are competent and any dangerous conditions like heavy snow, ice, and avalanche risks are properly managed or marked as closed or out of bounds.skiing causes a lot of medical claims and as pretty as the white stuff looks, it can be dangerous so let's be careful out there.even if you’re with a guide or you’re an experience backcountry skier, if you go into closed areas or outside the resort boundaries, our insurers may decide you’ve put yourself at needless risk and it’s likely you wont be covered.faq's cover yourself skiing and snowboarding skiing and snowboarding can be risky and injuries are common, even for the most experienced riders.if you're thinking of more extreme skiing it's important to check with us and read the policy wording carefully because some of our insurers can't offer cover - they find it very difficult to verify the individual's ability and level of risk.in general, cover is available for recreational skiing or snowboarding on piste and in areas designated 'safe' by ski resort staff within the resort’s boundaries.where you've bought a plan which includes the type of snowsports you'll be doing, there is cover for emergency medical treatment undertaken by qualified resort staff and any air evacuation or road ambulance transport to get you to the nearest suitable medical facility, all subject to theemergency assistance team’s approval.your gear wont be covered if you simply forget it or leave it anywhere where the general public has constant access or where items can be taken without your knowledge, including ski racks or roof racks (secured or not), unattended while you get lunch or in resort lockers in public areas.some plans also cover off piste skiing and snowboarding, provided it is not done in restricted or unsafe areas.intoxicated or have taken illegal drugs where your ability and decision making is probably compromised.again, our insurers have different terms of cover, dependent on which country you are from, so check out the policy conditions carefully to make sure that the cover is right for you and your particular winter sporting adventure.your winter sports equipment isn’t covered while you’re using it, but it may be covered if stolen from an official resort storage (where you’ve checked it in, kept the receipt and have a police report within 24 hours of it being stolen).if you stay within these safe areas and keep within your ability, then we can help if you have an accident.not all of our plans automatically include cover if you’re in an accident on the hill, so check the list ofcovered adventure sports and activities and read the full description of cover before you hit the slopes.
