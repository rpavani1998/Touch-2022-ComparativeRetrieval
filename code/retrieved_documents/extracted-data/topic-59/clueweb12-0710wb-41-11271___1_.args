open, wide, fringed with trees, and with great views out to mt. rainier, snoqualmie pass area peaks, and mt. stuart, and down to kachess lake and the yakima river valley.there had been gusty east winds on the road approach, but the climb was protected and the sun came out occasionally, softening the breakable crust in open areas.the photos are from a backcountry skiing trip to kachess ridge via silver creek, in the wenatchee national forest of washington: difficult backcountry skiing conditions but a nice ridge with extensive views list galleries over 180 photo galleries from pacific northwest backcountry snowboarding and skiing trips are available onturns all year cd-rom.the run down the ridge was fun, with a variety of not bad snow conditions - powder, light tree-drip, and, in exposed areas, stiff wind-pack.like the gallery below, each cd-rom photo gallery contains a thumbnails page linked to captioned full-sized photos, and usually a trip report.the ski back to the lip of the hanging valley was fast, and the waxless skis allowed me to climb the little rises along the way but get long glides as well.full-sized photos are available for browsing in the gallery below.photos by charles eldridge associated trip report: although i usually go up into silver creek valley to ski in the spring, when the trail which climbs up to the hanging valley is mostly bare, i thought that there might be enough snow now to ski all the way.i gave up skiing the trail about 100vf from the trailhead because my tips kept getting caught on shrubs protruding from the dwindling snowpack, but had a fast glide/skate/double-pole ride back to the car on the forest roads.a pole could be pushed in 15-20" before hitting a crust, but trail breaking wasn't bad as my skis only sank in a few inches at most.or rather, i side-slipped along the uphill side of the trail cut, the snow being way too fast to just point 'em, and this was easily the most tiring part of the trip.when i reached the lip of the hanging valley (~3600') and the start of the nice old-growth forest, the trees were suddenly holding lots of snow in their branches, and the quality of the snow became better - more powdery, though dense and still crusted in places from tree-drip.i have always had as my destination the meadows and short runs at the head of the valley, but i didn't think i would make it that far (another 4 miles) this day, so i decided to skin directly up the ne-facing valley slope to the top of kachess ridge.then i got into an area with many more small trees, and had to do some traversing to the left before i could climb again.the 4818 road was closed by about 2' of snow at the lake kachess snowpark (~2200'), so i fishscaled the 1.5 miles to the actual trailhead on forest roads nicely groomed by snowmobiles (none out today, fortunately).
