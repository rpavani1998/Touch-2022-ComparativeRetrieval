some of the "alpine downhill" ski trails (and alpine ski mountaineering tours) are more likely to have dramatic views than the cross-country ski trails -- but alpine downhill skiing (or ski mountaineering) requires different skills and equipment than cross-country skiing.perhaps the problem is that dramatic peaks are surrounded by steep slopes which are not appropriate for cross-country ski trails -- so might want to be prepared to rent snowshoes to hike to, or ride a mechnical lift up to see bigger views (but then also make inquiries about avalanche danger).lots of people already know about the incredible beauty and range of the downhill resorts and ski mountaineering.note: the glacier is at a much higher altitude than most folks normally do their xc skiing, so it's worth considering how your body is going to handle acclimatization.and most of the scenery is not dramatic in the obvious way of some places in the alps, so if you're looking to ski with a view of something more obviously dramatic than the wide spaces of the overall "plateau" environment, do some specific advance research.requires different skills and equipment than cross-country skiing.i assume there must be more interesting fun ski trails in norway, so if it's important to you to ski that sort of style, i'd suggest do some more specific research in advance, rather than assuming you'll find it on the obvious trails at the obvious places.some of the "alpine downhill" ski trails (and alpine ski mountaineering tours) are more likely to have dramatic views than the cross-country ski trails -- but alpine downhill skiing (or ski mountaineering)sovereign lake -- british columbia, canada (near vernon and the kelowna airport) -- notably technically interesting cross country ski trails, and connects to the silver star trail network (which also has alpine downhill skiing with lifts).mt bachelor also has lift-served downhill skiing and snowboarding.norway a place some american racers have tried is sognefjellet, near the sognefjord.Â  note that this place is near a very large body of water, which influences its weather.but it's worth doing some advance research: the fun interesting trail designs are not necessarily near the dramatic views or the obvious tourist destinations.silver star also has lift-served downhill skiing and snowboarding.lots of skiers you meet on the trails speak english, though you might not guess that from the websites.nearest airport is salzburg, but could also drive there from munich.
