combine this with a pronated orthotic and you get some really interesting results the point about ff varus posts has always caused an argument, however as pf3 says the foot remains in midstance.
basically, in order to be an effective alpine skier, the individual must be able to generate force between the medial edge of the downhill ski and the snow surface.
when making a ski turn, the skier must lean into toward the center of the turn's radius in order to keep their center of mass (com) in line with the srf vector.
the best "natural" alpine skiers tend to have rigid forefoot valgus type feet or, another way of saying this, is that their foot have increased medial column dorsiflexion stiffness.

i will use polypropylene orthoses, generally about 3/16" thick, with full length spenco topcover, flat rearfoot posts, casted in stj neutral, and often times with a forefoot varus extension to get the medial forefoot to be able to bear good weight onto the boot bottom.
registered users do not get displayed the advertisments in posted messages.
along with some of my skier students, we also did some preliminary research on ski biomechanics during my biomechanics fellowship.
foot orthoses nearly always can be made to make the skier more efficient since the foot orthosis can be used to optimize the foot-boot sole interface to allow more efficient weight transfer between the medial foot to the ski.

in 17 years of working with skiers of all levels from novice to world cup racers casting in a neutral postion with an orthoses designed for skiers has always worked for me alpine (downhill) skiing is a very interesting sport when it comes to the function of the foot.
one of the worst types of feet for alpine skiiing are those that have "overflexible" medial columns where the medial forefoot will simply dorsiflex with increasing plantar force acting on it (i.e. low medial column dorsiflexion stiffness).
however, many ski shops don't like doing this because it may alter the release mechanism of the binding which may increase the liability of the ski shop if an injury occurs with the canted binding.
if they don't, then they will become unstable and fall.
firm medial forefoot force transmitted to the boot, binding and then to the medial edge of the ski is necessary to initiate and hold an edge during a alpine ski turn.
most of these feet will have difficulty initiating and maintaining a ski turn since, in order to generate sufficient srf on the medial edge of the ski, they must internally rotate and adduct their knee excessively to try to get their medial forefoot to generate enough force on the boot bottom.
the most common problem i see is people in this position with badly made ski shop orthoses (sorry footbeds in most cases) with pain from the medial ankle and the lateral forefoot hitting the shell of the boot.
biomechanics, sports and foot orthoses foot orthoses and skiing welcome to thepodiatry arena forums, for communication between foot health professionals about podiatry and related topics.
the force that the snow exerts on the ski, orsnow reaction force (srf) will bend the ski, which, along with the frontal plane angle of the ski relative to the snow surface, will help generate the forces necessary to allow the skier to make a turn.
unfortunately, to my knowledge, this paper from 19 years ago is still the only paper published in the podiatric literature on ski boot fitting (santoro jp, kirby ka: boot fitting problems in the skier.
because of this lean, the skier's legs will naturally have an angulation with the snow surface in order to counteract the effects of the centripetal force from the turn.
the shell of the boot (i.e. boot cuff) may, in some alpine ski boots, be able to be adjusted in the frontal plane relative to the boot bottom.
and any time i used a lab built orthoses the best successes have been with full forefoot correction and a narrow grind, never the less i still see clients with some massively over sized orthotics from their doctor to put into ski boots, as a plea to these doctors please either learn to understand the biomechanics and fit of a ski boot or reffer your patients to someone who does.
thanked 2 times in 2 posts one of the interesting and often annoying things about most ski boots is that the shaft (cuff) of the boot is set at an angle, not the forward lean angle but a lateral angle of (depending on the make and model) approx 1-2.5 degrees inverted the average on a mens boot being 1.5degrees.
see the attached lecture slide from 20+ years ago when we used this antiquated technology called 35 mm kodachrome for our lectures.
