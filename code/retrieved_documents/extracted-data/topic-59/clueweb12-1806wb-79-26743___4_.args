there is no credible evidence that catastrophic injuries are increasing at a statistically significant rate.in both skiing and snowboarding, beginners suffer almost three times more injuries than the more experienced participants.the most critical determinants of injury, however, are still skier ability, relation of speed to athletic proficiency, and improper adjustment or poor functioning of equipment.injury patterns snowboarders have an increased rate of head injuries at 10% compared with skiers at 5%, but skiers are five times more likely to suffer a fatal head injury.other factors that affect injury rates include snow conditions, visibility, number of skiers on the slopes, skier fatigue, and the use of alcohol and other drugs.along with generally slower speed, this shortened "fall zone" (the area which snowboarders will probably slide if they fall) partly explains why snowboarders suffer fewer fatal and catastrophic injuries than skiers.in 1997, there were 17,500 head injuries (3,400 "potentially serious") associated with skiing and snowboarding.first-time snowboarders sustain a significantly higher incidence of emergent injuries (such as fracture, concussion, dislocation, lost teeth) necessitating immediate intervention.snowboard bindings lock both feet in the same plane and create an entirely different spectrum of injury than seen in skiing with its independent movement of each leg.wrist guards have been shown to be very effective in preventing wrist injuries in in-line skaters.head protection gear for all skiers and snowboarders can be considered protective as long as it is recognized that wearing a helmet does not confer invincibility or invulnerability to the user.falling is the leading cause of skiing (87%) and snowboarding (75%) injuries.this equates to a fatality rate of 0.57 per million skier/snowboarder visits or 2.88 deaths per million on-slope participants.avalanches kill by causing massive trauma or asphyxiation.collisions account for 10% of all injuries but 67% of hospital admissions and most of the fatalities.
