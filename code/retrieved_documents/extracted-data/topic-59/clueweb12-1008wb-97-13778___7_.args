ski bindings also offer good adjustability, not only to accommodate people with different boot sizes, but they are also set to accommodate the skier’s weight, strength and skiing ability - important points if you’re to avoid knee ligament injuries.modern skis are fitted with safety bindings so that the boot releases quickly from the ski when excess pressure is exerted or when the foot twists; ultimately helping to avoid injury when you fall.the neutral, forward-facing stance adopted by skiers as they carve their turns down the mountain comes more naturally to most; it eases the burden on the joints and muscles, working with more natural movements.snowboards do have adjustability but it is much more limited, enabling users to change the angle of their feet on the board according to their preference but not much else.the winter holiday experience has undoubtedly improved dramatically over the last 20 years thanks to the consideration given to the anatomical limitations of skiers and the subsequent effects on design of the equipment.we can all appreciate the improved thermal environment provided by enclosed gondola lifts that you sit inside, instead of totally exposed ‘all-weather’ chairlifts.ski bindings hold your boots on the skis, and transfer the pressure you put on your boots to the skis, allowing you to control their direction.ski boots have a huge array of adjustments that help you to get just the right fit to transfer your weight to the right part of the ski.however, knee injuries are less common in boarders than skiers because their legs can’t slide apart.without a quick release mechanism it means that snowboarders are attached to their boards until the bindings are manually undone - not a desirable prospect if you find yourself tumbling down the mountainside or sliding uncontrolled on a patch of ice.skiers also have extra tools to hand which can help in this situation - ski poles.snowboarders have the luxury of soft boots, something that after a full day on the slopes has a lot going for it.at that time of year when those of us with the bug for skiing and other snow sports set our sights on those powdery white slopes, i find the ergonomist in me emerging and begin to think about my hobby in a new light… i imagine that the seasoned ski bums and boarders amongst you will recognise the anecdotes.being able to gain momentum by pushing along is something that skiers gloat about as they leave the snowboarders in their wake.and having the head always turned so you can look down the slope, can lead to muscular fatigue in the neck.
