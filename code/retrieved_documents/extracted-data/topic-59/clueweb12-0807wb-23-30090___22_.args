the main findings of the present study were that beginners, snowboarders, children and adolescents were at increased overall risk of injury.alpine skiers, beginners, males, children and adolescents are at a higher risk of lower leg fractures, telemark skiers, males and adolescents are at a higher risk of shoulder injuries, while knee injuries occur more frequently among alpine skiers, females and beginners.the results of these studies showed that injury risk factors were quite consistent between less and potentially more severe cases, which means that a reporting bias was unlikely.sacco et al24 found that alpine skiers and snowboarders were equally prone to injury in an evaluation of skiing and snowboarding injuries admitted to the local level 1 trauma center over a 6-year period, but without any control material their conclusion is difficult to interpret.in the present study, the authors found that snowboarders had twice the overall injury risk of alpine and telemark skiers, and a three times higher risk for potentially severe injuries.however, while snowboarders had a higher injury rate than skiers for injuries to the upper body, they sustained fewer lower limb injuries than alpine skiers.snowboarding was associated with a two-fold higher risk of injury than alpine skiing, while there was no significant difference in injury risk between alpine and telemark skiing (table 2).previous section next section limitations recent studies on the risk factors of skiing and snowboarding injury have to some extent been inconclusive because they lack an appropriate control group or the number of injuries has been too small for multivariate analyses.rented equipment and skiing instruction did not seem to influence the overall risk of injury, while skiing instruction decreased the risk of potentially severe injuries.nevertheless, lower leg fractures are still common in young alpine skiers (17% of all injuries in alpine skiers up to 12 years old).beginners were at a higher risk of injuries compared to the intermediate, good and expert skiers (or ranging from 2.12 to 3.47), and non-nordic skiers were at a higher risk than the nordic skiers (or 1.37 to 2.36).female skiers and snowboarders had a significant lower risk of injuries in the crude model, but this was not statistically significant in the adjusted test.collision with another person or obstacle was reported in 12.9% of all cases, and the remaining injuries were the result of a fall or a jump.the strength of the current study is that the authors could assess key risk factors in alpine skiing and snowboarding by comparing injured cases to an uninjured, representative control group, while correcting for important confounders.the injury often occurs as a combination of compressive loading and twisting of the knee.19 this mechanism is typical in the alpine skiing discipline, when the skier loses balance or the ski edge catches during a turn.20 21 upper limb and head injuries are often associated with falling from a jump.22 23 thus, more cautious skiing may be an explanation for why female skiers and snowboarders have a lower risk for upper limb and head/neck injuries.
