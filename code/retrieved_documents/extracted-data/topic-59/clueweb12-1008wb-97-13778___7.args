for my part, i have always skied rather than snowboarded; it’s nothing personal, just that i was pushed down the mountain at a young age on two planks instead of one.
ski bindings hold your boots on the skis, and transfer the pressure you put on your boots to the skis, allowing you to control their direction.
boarders’ boots have laces.
or the way that manual dexterity problems have been overcome by the installation of automated lift pass systems where an electronic chip in the card is detected by the machine from a distance.
as we (skiers) view the run out from the top of the piste and negotiate the start of the schuss (skiing straight down) to ensure that we can gain enough speed to cover the ground, spare a thought for the boarders.
the one area where snowboarding can take a point away from skiing is the design of the boots.

being able to gain momentum by pushing along is something that skiers gloat about as they leave the snowboarders in their wake.
we can all appreciate the improved thermal environment provided by enclosed gondola lifts that you sit inside, instead of totally exposed ‘all-weather’ chairlifts.
(the combination of gloved fingers and a slippery card often resulted in a stinging slap from the recoil of the elastic cord attaching the lift pass to your jacket!)
ski boots have a huge array of adjustments that help you to get just the right fit to transfer your weight to the right part of the ski.
good plan, but they were ‘designed’ for two people to ride them together side by side.
at that time of year when those of us with the bug for skiing and other snow sports set our sights on those powdery white slopes, i find the ergonomist in me emerging and begin to think about my hobby in a new light… i imagine that the seasoned ski bums and boarders amongst you will recognise the anecdotes.

and having the head always turned so you can look down the slope, can lead to muscular fatigue in the neck.
the neutral, forward-facing stance adopted by skiers as they carve their turns down the mountain comes more naturally to most; it eases the burden on the joints and muscles, working with more natural movements.
ski bindings hold your boots on the skis, and transfer the pressure you put on your boots to the skis, allowing you to control their direction.
ski bindings also offer good adjustability, not only to accommodate people with different boot sizes, but they are also set to accommodate the skier’s weight, strength and skiing ability - important points if you’re to avoid knee ligament injuries.
however, knee injuries are less common in boarders than skiers because their legs can’t slide apart.

the bar was more likely to end up around your knees or halfway up your back.
skiers also have extra tools to hand which can help in this situation - ski poles.

snowboarders have the luxury of soft boots, something that after a full day on the slopes has a lot going for it.
and anyone who’s ever experienced the anthropometric disaster that is the t-bar lift will not be sorry to see its decline!
still, it helped to hide the humiliation of falling off the lift (as it was usually in full view of the queue).
the bar was more likely to end up around your knees or halfway up your back.
this means that you can go straight through the turnstile without having to root around in the wrong pocket for a swipe card.

the winter holiday experience has undoubtedly improved dramatically over the last 20 years thanks to the consideration given to the anatomical limitations of skiers and the subsequent effects on design of the equipment.
the external hard shell of ski boots makes them much more difficult to walk in.
i now know - snowboarding is not as ergonomically friendly as skiing!

the chances of getting someone next in the queue with a bottom at the same height as your own were remote to say the least.

the theory was that the cross bar sat comfortably behind your bottom and dragged you up the mountain.
in addition to these anatomical issues, there is also the practicality of overcoming areas of flat piste (run outs).

like most skiers, i do admire the cool and effortless glide achieved by boarders but still i cannot bring myself to convert.
still, all boots now are far removed from the leather boots you had to nail to the wooden planks that counted for skis.
without a quick release mechanism it means that snowboarders are attached to their boards until the bindings are manually undone - not a desirable prospect if you find yourself tumbling down the mountainside or sliding uncontrolled on a patch of ice.

snowboards do have adjustability but it is much more limited, enabling users to change the angle of their feet on the board according to their preference but not much else.
the posture of a boarder, with one shoulder leading the way, puts more strain on the upper body due to the twisted position.
they may have to unclip their bindings and walk, sometimes with one foot still attached - a very ungainly action - until a suitable gradient kicks in again where the board can slide on its own.

modern skis are fitted with safety bindings so that the boot releases quickly from the ski when excess pressure is exerted or when the foot twists; ultimately helping to avoid injury when you fall.
