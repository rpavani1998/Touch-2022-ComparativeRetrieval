while milk is unquestionably a superior food product which supplies us with calcium, protein, potassium, and calories (a critical consideration in some parts of the world), raw milk is often subject to contamination by e. coli, salmonella, campylobacteriosis, and listeria.there is some evidence that lactose intolerance (as well as a host of other conditions such as asthma, diabetes, allergies, arthritis, heart disease, etc.) is reduced or eliminated through drinking raw milk.pasteurization and refrigeration together make milk safe for those without access to fresh milk.poor refrigeration and/or handling of raw milk, as well as poor health of an animal, can cause microorganisms to grow and multiply, with the potential to cause disease.it ain't the government's business if someone prefers to drink raw milk, and it's in a dairyman's best interests to supply raw milk to his customers that is clean, fresh, and sanitary.contamination can occur either from a sick animal or, more often, from mishandling of the milk (including handling by sick people).pasteurization has allowed dairy farmers to distribute their milk to wider markets.the process of heating milk in order to kill pathogens will also naturally kill some of the beneficial bacteria, vitamins, and enzymes found in fresh milk.refrigeration could keep milk fresh for up to a week, but until recently refrigeration as a means of keeping products fresh was expensive and unreliable.diseases passed by milk can include tuberculosis, diphtheria, strep throat, scarlet fever, and typhoid fever.even those who personally choose to drink raw milk cannot dispute the benefits pasteurization has offered to the public at large.milk contamination can occur sporadically and unevenly, so testing may miss contaminated milk.additionally, if anyone in your family has a compromised immune system, pasteurization adds an extra level of safety to their diet.putting aside the extremist claims that pasteurized milk is the cause of everything from cancer to dust bunnies under the bed, there are indeed drawbacks to pasteurization.raw milk should also be distinguished from organic milk, which is defined as milk from cows raised and fed in prescribed ways (no growth hormones or antibiotics, access to pasture, etc.).
