why is raw milk better?
heat alters milks amino acids lysine and tyrosine, making the whole complex of proteins less available; it promotes rancidity of unsaturated fatty acids and destruction of vitamins.
info about goat milk: normal goat milk fat has a much higher concentration of so called medium  chain fatty acids (mct), caproic, caprylic, capric, lauric, myristic (33%)  verses cow milk fat (17%), and lower in stearic and oleic (27%) lower than cow  milk fat (45%) .

pasteurization is the sterilization of liquids such as milk, orange juice,  wine, and beer, as well as cheese, to destroy disease-causing and other  undesirable bacteria/organisms.
you need some fat in your diet, but you need to keep in mind that too much of anything (including a good thing) can be bad for you.
raw milk contains beneficial bacteria as well as lactic acids that allow these beneficial bacteria to implant in the intestines.
lipase in  raw milk helps the body digest and utilize butterfat.(3) butterfat has a cortisone-like factor which is heat sensitive (destroyed by  heat) that prevents stiffness in the joints.

this, and the fact that pasteurized milk puts an unnecessary strain on the pancreas to produce digestive enzymes, may explain why milk consumption in societies that drink pasteurized milk has been linked with diabetes.(3) pasteurization destroys all the enzymes in milk -- in fact, the test for successful pasteurization is absence of enzymes.

once heated, milk becomes rotten, with precipitated minerals that cant be absorbed (hence osteoporosis), with sugars that cant be digested (hence allergies), and with fats that are toxic.
much documentation exists showing the uniquely beneficial effects of those mct, medium chain fatty acids in various medical problems, disorders and diseases, such as those suffering from malabsorption syndromes chluria, steatorrhe, hyperlipoproteinemia intestinal resection, coronary bypass, premature infant feeding, childhood epilepsy, cystic fibrosis, gallstones, angcontributeto general thriftiness of children.(5) goat milk provides 13% more calcium, 25% more vit b-6, 47% more vit a, 134% more potassium and 350% more niacin than cow milk.

if you pasteurize the milk,  thus killing the good bacteria, then any bad bacteria that may manage to get  into the milk will multiply and grow quickly, because pasteurized milk is the  prefect medium for bacteria to grow and there is no longer any good bacteria  present to fight the bad bacteria off.

the fat can be more readily digested and absorbed because lipases attack ester linkages of these fatty acids more readily than those of longer chains (cow) and unlike cows milk, goat milk does not contain agglutinin; as a result the fat globules in goat milk do not cluster, again allowing the ease of digestion and absorption.(6) what about fat content?
