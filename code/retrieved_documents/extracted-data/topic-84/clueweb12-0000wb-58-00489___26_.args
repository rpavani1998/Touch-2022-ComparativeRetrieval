many people have come to the conclusion that milk is valuable as a food only for the young, or as a food-medicine for invalids and those suffering from tuberculosis, anemia, neuritis, rheumatics, and for nervous wrecks and neurasthenics.they are free from disease-creative constituents but are deficient in the important elements contained in milk fats and other fats, and become dangerous to health if wholly substituted for dairy butter in the dietary of children and invalids.besides being an almost perfect food (lacking only in cellulose), milk is a remedial agent whose use alone has been the means of eliminating various ailments, particularly those caused by the toxins and acids with which the system has become filled by the use of too much meat and denatured foods.young animals fed on milk develop rapidly and normally, show strength and vitality; those fed on substitutes for milk, however perfect these substitutes appear to be, are usually more or less weak, sickly and in some manner undeveloped.milk contains the organic mineral elements and an abundance of the vitamins, both of which are essential to the normal health and growth of children; it is also the ideal basic diet for those who are suffering from "deficiency" or "wasting" diseases, but when prescribed for these ailments, the whole milk must be used as most of the vitamins are contained in the butterfat.although these substitute foods are rich in organic mineral elements, they cannot take the place of milk as a child's food and this is the reason why the death rate is usually extremely high among children who are deprived of milk.milk contains warmth and energy-creating material, protein and casein, which renew or build nerves and tissues, and the large percentage of cell salts vital for repair and equalization of the entire organism.the casein content of the buttermilk does not vary greatly from that found in skim-milk; the amount of organic mineral elements is about the same; therefore, practically in all respects it is just as valuable as a food, is more readily accepted by some stomachs than skim-milk, and, due to the greater neutralizing qualities of the lactic acid not present in skim-milk, is more desirable in the treatment of some ailments.it is a food of great value to children and adults not only because of its energy-producing power in concentrated and easily digested form, but also because it is the carrier of an animal or vitalized vitamin which is found in sufficient abundance in no other fat; vegetable and nut fats contain it to a slight degree.though a perfectly balanced food, milk alone is too concentrated to maintain health in grown people - cellulose is needed and eliminating agents; these are secured by the free use of vegetables, and of fruit between meals.it repairs and builds tissue, stimulates the cells of the body to greater activity and acts as a natural tonic without stimulation; to the nerves and brain it is a food beyond compare.these foods supply all the vital mineral elements, material for nerve and brain development; growth proceeds normally, and it is practically impossible for mental or physical weaknesses to develop.due to this fact, it is best that fresh milk be served to children and invalids, and if it is still so fresh as to be warm from the cow, it is at its best for all cases in which vitality is extremely low.casein easily replaces all other forms of protein and this is the reason for its great value as a fundamental constructive agent in the diseases mentioned.if milk and butter are entirely unobtainable, then animal fats and the richest kind of fish should be plentifully supplied as a basic food to old people, invalids, and even children; fish, especially, will help to make up the deficiency.
