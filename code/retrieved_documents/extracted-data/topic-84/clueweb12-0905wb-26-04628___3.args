we have friends who have a cow and they are willing to let us have raw milk, however i question whether, as a christian, it would be right to take it.

i researched raw milk, and wanted to try it, since he rejected all the substitutes.
my husband is in the military and we are now living in okinawa.
if you have a different container from which you can’t skim as i mentioned, i would try transferring it to a gallon jar and then allow it to sit for awhile in the fridge and then skim as described.

sometimes i don’t communicate too well.
