goat milk is valued for the elderly, sick, babies, children with cow milk allergies, patients with ulcers, and even preferred for raising orphan foals or puppies.goat milk is higher in vitamin a, niacin, choline and inositol than cow milk, but it is lower in vitamin b6, b12, c and carotenoids.however, goats are also valued for precisely the same reasons - for example, browsing by goats can help to reduce bush encroachment in grazing areas dominated by cattle and sheep.goat's milk compares favourably in nutritive value with cow's milk.goats are able to survive on browse in situations where other livestock, cattle in particular and also sheep, cannot.it has performed well in terms of adaptability and milk yield.the goat odour is, however, a detriment to goat keeping and milk consumption if not properly controlled.feeding and nutrition goats are able to survive on browse in situations where other livestock, cattle in particular and also sheep, cannot.because of this ability to survive under harsh conditions, goats have been kept by man in numbers that are greater than some environments can sustain.in the latter case it is most likely that there has also been some degree of direct selection, even if only for those individuals that appeared to survive better than others, were easier to handle, or that best fitted the herders' or socio-cultural requirements.it contains smaller fat globules and as a consequence it is easier for some people to digest and does not require homogenisation.also unlike sheep, goats easily revert to feral or wild condition given a chance, and populations of feral goats occur in many parts of the world.see the section on tree fodder the resulting over-grazing has destroyed many tree and woodland areas which was then blamed on the goats rather than man.spanish and south african goats are best known for meat producing ability (e.g.the south african boer goat ), whilst indian and nubian derived goat breeds are dual-purpose meat and milk producers.they function in stimulating oestrus in male and female goats, improving conception.
