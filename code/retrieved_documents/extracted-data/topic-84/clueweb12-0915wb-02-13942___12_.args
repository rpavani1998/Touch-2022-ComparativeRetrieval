this can eliminate a whole host of environmental odors, microbes, contaminations and assure a truly quality milk.practices which assure safe and wholesome quality of goat milk are based on dairy cow experiences but must be confirmed for applicability to goat husbandry, not only for microbiological safety, but also for acceptability of taste and odor, which so far has been a widespread major deterrent to public acceptance of goat milk, and therefore impedes its use in human nutrition where medical reasons indicate its value.it is in the farmers' direct financial interest to take advantage of this technology, which can deliver milk from the mammary gland of goats to the cooling tank and processing plant without ever coming in contact with barn air, with other animals or the workers.besides their unique flavor, which has serious consequences in improper handling of goat milk, these medium chain fatty acids (mct) have become of considerable interest to the medical profession, because of their unique benefits in many metabolic diseases of humans (babayan, 1981).however, technology requires its own proper care and sanitary management, otherwise it will lead to oxidation, contamination, bacteria invasion, and loss of the quality of milk it was meant to assure.standards based on research with dairy cows are discriminatory to dairy goats in many aspects and must be replaced by suitable goat milk standards.a popular therapy among pediatricians is the change to vegetable protein soy-based formula; however, an estimated 20 to 50 percent of all infants with cow milk protein intolerance will also react adversely to soy proteins (lothe et al., 1982).however, absolute scc numbers rose much higher in normal goat milk than expected from cow milk, which suggests that the goat udder responds to pathogens much more actively than cow udders do.to safeguard quality milk production, at least 5 major parameters are routinely monitored by various agencies which have jurisdiction over the production of milk through commercial channels: these five parameters need to be at optimum or it will cost the farmer money, directly or indirectly.swedish studies have shown that cow milk was a major cause of colic, sometimes fatal, in 12 to 30 percent formula-fed, less than 3-month-old infants (lothe et al., 1982).medical research evidence for goat milk powerful justification for goat milk can come from medical needs, especially for infants afflicted with various ailments, including cow milk protein sensitivities.the various components of milk fat, fatty acids, differ in carbon chain length and saturation, which has nutritional and medical significance.if milk composition is below minimum market standards, if somatic cell counts and bacteria levels indicate mastitis or unclean and improper handling, if milk is off in appearance, flavor, taste and temperature, if milk contains water or veterinary or sanitary treatment or pesticide residues or traces of toxic molds from feeds, then entire loads of milk shipment or tanks can be unsalable, can be condemned and a big financial loss to the farmer, jeopardizing even future milk sales.quality assurance recently, the national milk producers federation joined forces with the american veterinary medical association to develop a "quality assurance protocol" plan and campaign, that should ensure freedom from drug residues in milk such as sulfamethazine, other sulfonamides, antibiotics gentamicin, erythromycin, oxytetracycline, other pesticides and even toxic mold residues, etc.research has established that the scc in cow milk is indicative of, although less than equal, the number of leukocytes in milk, which of course indicates subclinical or clinical mastitis.
