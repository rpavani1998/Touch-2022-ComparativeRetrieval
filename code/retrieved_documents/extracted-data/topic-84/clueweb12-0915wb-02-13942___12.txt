it was also concluded that if cmt scores were used for legal thresholds, at  cmt-1, a misclassification of 52percent of normal goat milk would occur.

this has led to the unfortunate application of cow milk standards by regulatory  sanitary officials to goat milk in commerce, in the absence of established  separate goat milk standards, and to the detriment of goat milk producers.
often it is difficult to  overcome seasonal breeding and the then common late stage of lactation in all  goats, which means that at some time of the year most members of a goat herd  are in late lactation with naturally high levels of salt, solids and somatic  cell counts in their milk.

it seems apparent that in this area is great potential for identifying a unique importance and role for goat milk, specifically goat milk fat and probably goat milk butter, which has not received much attention at all.
thus, taste quality of goat milk is directly affected by the status of udder health.
this discussion is limited to the effects the farm producer can and will  have on the quality of milk, which is a most perishable and most fragile  product, easily affected negatively by improper feeding of the animals,  improper handling of them prior and during milking, improper handling of the  milk during and after milking including improper equipment handling, cooling  and transportation (haenlein, 1987b).

this is a critical question to be asked and answered by all who are trying help establish a dairy goat business and industry.
by george f. w. haenlein cooperative extension dairy specialist university of delaware abstract mounting evidence indicates several basic differences in goat and cow physiology, biochemistry, microbiology and in the composition of their milk.
as the milk supply from cows is more plentiful and cheaper, we have the challenge to demonstrate why there are good reasons to produce goat milk; if not, we are strictly only in the pet business.
biochemical differences between goat milk and cow milk goat milk proteins have many significant differences in their amino acid compositions from the milk of other mammalian species, especially in relative proportions of the various milk proteins and in their genetic polymorphisms (jenness, 1980; boulanger et al., 1984; addeo et al., 1988; ambrosoli et al., 1988).

this in turn indicates and may explain significant differences to cow milk in digestion by infants and patients (mack, 1953), which traditionally have been explained by the "homogenized" nature of goat milk fat.
although goat milk has a higher content of the strong smelling caproic, caprylic and capric acids in its milk fat, with good milking practices they are enclosed within the fat globule membrane.

standard plate counts (spc) of bacteria should be less than 10,000 per  milliliter.
approximately 40 percent of all patients sensitive to cow milk proteins tolerate goat milk proteins (brenneman, 1978; zeman, 1982), possibly because lactalbumin is immunospecific between species (hill, 1939).
the important question of whether these three worldwide adopted methods and the legal threshold set by public health officials of 1 million scc/ml milk apply to cow and goat milk equally accurately and validly, despite the many mentioned differences in the physiology and composition of milk of the two species has only recently begun to be studied (haenlein, 1987a, b; hinckley, 1991; kalogridou-vassiliadou et al., 1992).

once  cool, quality goat milk must be held in the 36 to 42o f range without  interruption nor variation to maintain its quality and long shelf-life.
that is why good goat udders look  much more collapsed and empty after milking than cow udders.
however, technology requires its own proper care and sanitary management, otherwise it will lead to oxidation, contamination, bacteria invasion, and loss of the quality of milk it was meant to assure.
thus, only scc methods which specifically identify dna, give valid counts of leukocytes in goat milk.
this can eliminate a whole host of environmental odors,  microbes, contaminations and assure a truly quality milk.
also, prevalent bacteria and pathogens  in goat udders are often of different species than in cow udders.
actually, the composition of goat milk fat may be much more important than  the prevalence of large numbers of small fat globules, because it too differs  significantly from the composition of cow milk fat under average feeding  conditions (haenlein, 1992).
often it is difficult to overcome seasonal breeding and the then common late stage of lactation in all goats, which means that at some time of the year most members of a goat herd are in late lactation with naturally high levels of salt, solids and somatic cell counts in their milk.
thus, at various times of the year, dairy goats are all in early, or middle, or late stage of lactation, accentuating normal seasonal milk composition changes, that are related to stages of lactation, to estrus and low amounts of milk.

thus it is high time to include in these developments the sanitarians for establishing quality standards, and the medical profession for evidence on the medical and nutritional benefits of goat milk.

and all this adds even more importance to the establishment of acceptable practices and standards for quality goat milk production, which so far has been lagging behind those for dairy cows, but which require separate establishment because of the many unique physiological and metabolic characteristics of goats compared to cows (haenlein, 1980, 1987a, 1991; hinckley, 1990; kalogridou-vassiliadou et al., 1992).

capric, caprylic and other mct have been used for treatment of malabsorption syndromes, intestinal disorders, coronary diseases, pre-mature infant nutrition, cystic fibrosis, gallstone problems, because of their unique metabolic abilities of providing energy and at the same time lowering, inhibiting and dissolving cholesterol deposits (schwabe et al., 1964; greenberger and skillman, 1969; kalser, 1971; tantibhedhyangkul and hashim, 1975, 1978).

practices which assure safe and wholesome quality of goat milk are based on dairy cow experiences but must be confirmed for applicability to goat husbandry, not only for microbiological safety, but also for acceptability of taste and odor, which so far has been a widespread major deterrent to public acceptance of goat milk, and therefore impedes its use in human nutrition where medical reasons indicate its value.

the  california mastitis test (cmt), obtainable from any feed or supply dealer is an  excellent farm-side monitor, even for goats, and should be used often and  regularly on each goat and each udder half.
not surprisingly, the compositional differences are also part of physiological differences in the secretion process of milk from inside the udder from the alveolar cells.

many sources can be identified for off-flavors in cow milk and the same  applies to goat milk: feeds (molasses, citrus pulp), forages (rape, rapeseed  meal), weeds (onions, garlic), environmental odors (oil, gasoline, moldy rags,  lime, cement, active bucks); normal physiology (early lactation colostrum, late  lactation high salt contents, estrus, mastitis, sickness); improper handmilking  procedures; improper equipment and handling (oxidation due to risers in milking  pipelines, vacuum slips and searches, sun exposure, filthy clogged strainers  and pipeline connections, unclean milking equipment, wash water not hot);

" somatic cell counts equipment for monitoring somatic cell count (scc) levels in cow milk includes the cmt applied in the barn, and electronic automated machines in labs, the so-called coulter counter, or the fossomatic, which use different chemical principals to achieve supposedly the same scc evaluations.

this has led to the unfortunate application of cow milk standards by regulatory sanitary officials to goat milk in commerce, in the absence of established separate goat milk standards, and to the detriment of goat milk producers.
good procedures exist about how to best achieve acceptable milk flavor and with it production of quality milk: quality testing to monitor the concerns for quality milk production, a number of gauges and tests can be routinely used on dairy goat farms.
this will then be expected to further increase the absolute levels of scc in  normal goat milk above those reported in the studies so far.
