according to this researcher, all these conclusions reveal that regular  consumption of goat milk – a natural food with highly beneficial  nutritional characteristics - “has positive effects on mineral  metabolism, recovery from ferropenic anaemia and bone mineralisation in rats.
goats' milk was found to help with the digestive and metabolic utilization of minerals such as iron, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium.
although there is no doubt that these findings may be a base for further in depth study of the multiple health benefits of goat milk, the ugr researcher warns that “studies in humans are still required in order to confirm the findings obtained in rats and to promote goat milk consumption both in the general population and in the population affected by nutritional ferropenic anaemia and pathologies related to bone demineralisation.”
to carry out this study, the metabolic balance technique has been used both in rats with experimentally induced nutritional ferropenic anaemia and in a control group of rats.

they found reason to believe that goats' milk could help prevent diseases such as anemia and bone demineralization.
among these properties it helps to prevent ferropenic anaemia (iron deficiency) and bone demineralisation (softening of the bones).
better results with goat milk results obtained in the study reveal that ferropenic anaemia and bone demineralisation caused by this pathology have a better recovery with goat milk.

goats' milk was found to help with  the digestive and metabolic utilization of minerals such as iron, calcium,  phosphorus and magnesium.
due to the higher bioavailability of iron, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium, the restoration of altered haematological parameters and the better levels of parathyroid hormone (pth), a hormone that regulates the calcium balance in the organism was found in the rats that consumed this food.
among these properties it helps to prevent ferropenic anaemia  (iron deficiency) and bone demineralisation (softening of the bones).
javier díaz castro points out that the inclusion of goat milk with  normal or double calcium content in the diet “favours digestive and  metabolic utilisation of iron, calcium and phosphorus and their deposit in  target organs - parts of the organism to which these minerals are preferably  sent - involved in their homeostatic regulation.”
in addition, and unlike observations in cow milk, its calcium enrichment does not interfere in the bioavailability of the minerals studied.”

this project, conducted by doctor javier díaz castro and directed by  professors margarita sánchez campos, mª inmaculada lópez  aliaga and mª josé muñoz alférez, focuses on the  comparison between the nutritional properties of goat milk and cow milk, both  with normal calcium content and calcium enriched, against the bioavailability  of iron, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium.

in order to know how the nutritive utilisation of these minerals may affect their metabolic distribution and destination, the ugr researcher has determined the concentration of these minerals in the different organs involved in their homeostatic regulation and different haematological parameters in relation to the metabolism of the minerals.
