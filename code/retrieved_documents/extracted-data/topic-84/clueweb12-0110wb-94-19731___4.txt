they suggested that the higher levels of mct's (medium chain tricglycerides) in goat milk could account for the improved absorption of iron, and that the higher levels of amino acids cysteine and lysine could also be a factor - natural homogenization: goat milk is already homogenized: the natural homogenization of goat milk is, from a human health standpoint, much better than the mechanically homogenized cow milk product.
