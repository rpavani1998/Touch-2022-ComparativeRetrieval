contamination can occur either from a sick animal or, more often, from mishandling of the milk (including handling by sick people).
while milk is unquestionably a superior food product which supplies us with calcium, protein, potassium, and calories (a critical consideration in some parts of the world), raw milk is often subject to contamination by e. coli, salmonella, campylobacteriosis, and listeria.
pasteurization has allowed dairy farmers to distribute their milk to wider markets.
but to those people who are concerned about the dairy industry's additives such as antibiotics, growth hormones, and even bleach (to whiten the milk), the entire commercial dairy industry begins to seem, well, yucky.
although every email is read, busy schedules generally do not permit a personal response to each one.
this meant milk had to be trekked into the city from outlying areas and sold in stores.
and the trouble with contaminated milk is it may look, smell, and taste just fine.
understand i'm talking about home milk production, not milk being sold in stores.
raw milk should also be distinguished from organic milk, which is defined as milk from cows raised and fed in prescribed ways (no growth hormones or antibiotics, access to pasture, etc.).
putting aside the extremist claims that pasteurized milk is the cause of everything from cancer to dust bunnies under the bed, there are indeed drawbacks to pasteurization.
additionally, if anyone in your family has a compromised immune system, pasteurization adds an extra level of safety to their diet.
organic milk is sometimes pasteurized, sometimes not (it will say so on the carton).
it ain't the government's business if someone prefers to drink raw milk, and it's in a dairyman's best interests to supply raw milk to his customers that is clean, fresh, and sanitary.
personally i would not buy unpasteurized milk products from a store.
by the time the milk is consumed, it could be rife with problems.
they must, because they are under the eagle eye of both government inspectors (many of whom are biased against raw milk consumption) as well as customers.
organic milk is sometimes pasteurized, sometimes not (it will say so on the carton).
you don’t need an expensive pasteurizer for home use.
we can always count on the news media to whip these concerns into frenzy whenever a true case of e. coli or salmonella come to light (forgetting that these cases are news-worthy because of their rarity).
give the customer what he wants.
there was once a time when livestock could be kept within city limits, and the job of many children was to herd their family cow to the outskirts of the city to graze for the day.
even those who personally choose to drink raw milk cannot dispute the benefits pasteurization has offered to the public at large.
the lewises live on 20 acres in north idaho with their two homeschooled children, assorted livestock, and a shop that overflows into the house with depressing regularity.
while doubtless there have been incidences of this, on the whole commercial dairies are vigorously inspected for sanitation standards.
but i absolutely believe customers should be able to buy raw milk from farmers.
we have milked cows, horses, goats, yaks, buffalo, camels, and probably a bunch of other mammals (anything in a pinch, right?).
quite simply, it's the rapid heating and subsequent cooling of milk to kill off microorganisms that might be residing in milk.
but the fact of the matter is, we have some of the safest food in the world.
the reason is because i know what my cow eats, how she's treated, and how i handle her milk.
and even when refrigeration works, raw milk simply goes bad faster than its pasteurized counterpart.
but to those people who are concerned about the dairy industry's additives such as antibiotics, growth hormones, and even bleach (to whiten the milk), the entire commercial dairy industry begins to seem, well, yucky.
by the way, pasteurization should not be confused with homogenization, which is simply breaking up the fat globules into smaller sizes so they no longer separate in the milk.
in the slow method, milk is heated between 140 and 150° f and held for 30 minutes.
poor refrigeration and/or handling of raw milk, as well as poor health of an animal, can cause microorganisms to grow and multiply, with the potential to cause disease.
i seldom hear people say store-bought milk tastes better after drinking cold fresh raw milk.
the process of heating milk in order to kill pathogens will also naturally kill some of the beneficial bacteria, vitamins, and enzymes found in fresh milk.
if you've grown up on a diet of pasteurized milk, you'll notice a taste difference right away when drinking raw milk (and vice versa).
i've also read accusations that pasteurization allows commercial dairies to get a bit sloppy in the cleanliness department because pasteurizing renders dirty milk safe.
but it's not hard to pasteurize your own milk.
in the flash method, heat the milk to 161° f and hold that temperature for 15 to 20 seconds, then cool.
set the pot in ice water (replacing the ice when necessary) and stir the milk constantly until the temperature reaches 60° f, then stir occasionally until the temp reaches 50° f. a sterile stainless steel spoon is recommended.

there is even evidence that abraham lincoln's mother, nancy, died of "milk sickness" after drinking contaminated milk from cows that had eaten the poisonous white snakeroot plant.

milk contamination can occur sporadically and unevenly, so testing may miss contaminated milk.
your average family cow is fed much differently than your average commercial cow, with a diet much richer in grass and less full of grain.
it doesn't help that we can detect ever-smaller quantities of these microscopic terrors with the aid of modern technology.
contamination can occur either from a sick animal or, more often, from mishandling of the milk (including handling by sick people).
nothing's perfect, after all, and in the quest for "safe" milk, many of the benefits of raw milk are sacrificed.
we became more and more disconnected from the source of all our dairy products...as well as more concerned about the quality of those products as dairies became enormous, commercialized enterprises.
and even when refrigeration works, raw milk simply goes bad faster than its pasteurized counterpart.
pasteurization and refrigeration together make milk safe for those without access to fresh milk.
government dairy inspectors will seldom admit that raw milk can be healthy.
i've also read accusations that pasteurization allows commercial dairies to get a bit sloppy in the cleanliness department because pasteurizing renders dirty milk safe.
by the time the milk is consumed, it could be rife with problems.
diseases passed by milk can include tuberculosis, diphtheria, strep throat, scarlet fever, and typhoid fever.
refrigeration could keep milk fresh for up to a week, but until recently refrigeration as a means of keeping products fresh was expensive and unreliable.
the advantage of a commercially-manufactured pasteurizer is obvious (consistent results).
in the slow method, milk is heated between 140 and 150° f and held for 30 minutes.
milking matilda on a chilly morning the benefits of pasteurization it is impossible to overemphasize the importance pasteurization (and refrigeration) has had on public health in developed nations in the last hundred years.
in both methods, rapid cooling is essential.
on the other hand, i have no doubt that most dairies which supply raw milk to stores have ultra-clean facilities, uber-healthy cows, and extraordinarily sanitary handling procedures.
the process of heating milk in order to kill pathogens will also naturally kill some of the beneficial bacteria, vitamins, and enzymes found in fresh milk.
don't go above 161° f or the milk will taste cooked.
set the pot in ice water (replacing the ice when necessary) and stir the milk constantly until the temperature reaches 60° f, then stir occasionally until the temp reaches 50° f. a sterile stainless steel spoon is recommended.

if your milk-handling procedures are not the cleanest or you lack suitable refrigerationor you're simply squeamish at the thought of raw milkyou may wish to pasteurize.
but as cities grew larger and laws regarding urban livestock (and their "by-products") changed, cows could no longer be kept by urban families.
the drawbacks of pasteurization putting aside the extremist claims that pasteurized milk is the cause of everything from cancer to dust bunnies under the bed, there are indeed drawbacks to pasteurization.
also, while bacterial contamination may be below the detectable limit at the time of testing, bacteria are well-known for proliferating rapidly.

unless milk smells sour or has turned to sludge, you can't detect the presence of e. coli or listeria by taste.
