too much cow's milk in a child's diet can put him at risk for iron-deficiency anemia (because milk can interfere with the absorption of iron) and decrease the child's desire for other foods.goat milk is also deficient in folic acid, which can lead to megaloblastic anemia.babies who are exposed to cow's milk before their first birthday are more likely to be anemic, have diarrhea or vomiting, and/or experience an allergic reaction (the proteins in milk are more numerous than those in other milk products, such as the yogurt).goat's milk is high in sodium (like cow's milk) and is very high in chloride and potassium, which makes the renal solute load too high for babies.of course, if baby has a cow's milk allergy or there is a strong history of allergy to cow's milk in the family, yogurt, cheese and all other foods made with cow's milk should be avoided until 12 months or later.anumber of studies have also indicated that early introduction of cow's milk may contribute to the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.the excessive protein load in cow's milk can also overload a baby's kidneys.while it's true that whole goats milk (and whole cow's milk) was commonly used prior to the advent of infant formulas it is also true that the infant mortality and morbidity rate during the times of such substitutions was very high.this can cause gastrointestinal bleeding and can result in anemia and poor growth (these problems are usually undetected until months later).between six and twelve months, supplementing with solids (instead of formula) or very small amounts of cow, goat, soy or rice milk is less of a problem, as long as baby is still nursing for themajority of milk intake and baby is not allergic.many infants still have problems with cow's milk formula (allergies, gi problems, etc.).he also suggests that supplemental milk of any kind is not all that necessary if the baby is allowed to nurse frequently when with mom.however, babies under a year are more at risk for allergic reactions (see below) so it can be a good idea to wait.also, infants who are allergic to cow's milk protein are often allergic to goat's milk too."goat milk is touted as having exceptional nutritional value over cow's milk, but for tiny tummies it just doesn't measure up."
