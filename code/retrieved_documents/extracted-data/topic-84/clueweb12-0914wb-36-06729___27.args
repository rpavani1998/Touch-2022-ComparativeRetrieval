mct, especially caprylic (c8:0) and capric (c10:0) have become accepted treatment for patients with malabsorption symptoms, a variety of metabolic disorders, cholesterol problems and infant malnutrition, because of their unique roles of providing energy to the human metabolism instead of lipids to adipose tissues, and because of their ability to limit and dissolve serum cholesterol (kalser, 1971; tantibhedhyangkul & hashim, 1978).
many components in ewe or goat milk as in cow's milk, especially fat and protein, are high in colostrum in early lactation, much lower thereafter until they rise again markedly at the end of lactation, when yields are low (anifantakis & kandarakis, 1980).
it must be emphasized that cow's milks, when ewe or goat milks are compared with them, also have a wide composition range due to breeds, e.g. average holstein milk fat at 3.4 percent versus average jersey milk fat at 5.1 percent, and milk protein from 3.3 percent to 3.9 percent (anifantakis, 1986), besides other breeds.

energy shortage in the diet can change the fatty acid composition of milk fat towards more medium-chain fatty acids, while daily milk yield may decrease and fat content increase (moran-fehr, 1981).
starchy supplements like cereal grains or fats and fatty seeds from sunflowers or roasted soybeans increase the energy density of the daily diet, and oil meals increase the protein density.
in freezing of cheeses the ph and proteolysis may change (fontecha et al., 1994).
this provides, therefore, considerable potential to tailor-make ewe and goat milks according to the needs and preferences of consumers, and to provide an alternative to cow's milk, where this is economically or medically advantageous.

the incidence of cow's milk allergy has been found to be about 8 percent or even more in 1-year old infants (host et al., 1988), but goat milk can be a successful treatment in most cases of direct or indirect cow milk allergy (walker, 1964; brenneman, 1978; grezesiak, 1989).
however, milk secretion in goats is apocrine, while in cows it is merocrine, which explains why goat milk may have very high counts of somatic cells, especially in late lactation milk or in the last strippings of milk, without any relationship to mastitis (park & humphrey, 1986; haenlein, 1993).
the mediterranean region produces 66 percent of the world's ewe milk (table 1) and 18 percent of the world's goats milk (table 2) (fao, 1994).

a typical serving size of milk is 1 cup with 245 ml content, which is used as a standard in the usa for comparison of nutrient intake (gebhardt & matthews, 1991; nrc, 1968).
when grain concentrate supplementation makes up more than 50 percent of the daily dry matter intake by goats, decreased chewing, less rumination and a shortage of salivation of rumen contents occurs (kawas et al., 1991).

ultrafiltration removal of glycine increased acetaldehyde production in goat milk.
goats and ewe like other ruminants require a daily minimum of long fiber in the diet to prevent acidotic rumen conditions, which lead to fatal parakeratosis and enterotoxemia, or at least to laminitis, significantly depressed milk fat contents, but also possibly increased milk protein contents (merin et al., 1988).
this gives much support to the contention that improved ewe and goat milk production is one of the best strategies to relieve human starvation, undernutrition and malnutrition and therefore has great market growth potential, incentive and justification, especially in areas where pasture conditions, climate, mountainous terrain and economic conditions favor small ruminants.
a major portion of this variation includes negative correlations between milk yield and composition, i.e. low yields have higher contents and vice versa.

a more intensive feeding system can be appropriately devised with a complete diet of hay, silage and concentrates mixed together loose (tmr, total mixed ration) or in a pelleted or cubed form (cavani et al., 1991).
to prevent a decreased rumen ph, the feeding of buffers like sodium bicarbonate and magnesium oxide is beneficial.
fermentation during yogurt processing and cheese ripening also causes significant changes in the composition of the products due to proteolysis, lipolysis, glycolysis, development of flavor compounds and liberation of non-protein n-compounds, free amino acids, free fatty acids and ammonia as extensively documented by anifantakis (1991) (table 8 ).

this will be even more important in the future, when it becomes better known how to change original farm milk composition by manipulating e.g. the feeding of goats and ewes in order to tailor-make milk to the needs of diet conscious and disease afflicted consumers and their children, and to satisfy consumers with higher incomes, who have developed a sophisticated connoisseur taste for goat and ewe milk products.

besides the differences in milk proteins, which have commercial importance in cheese making and medical significance in digestion and allergies, the considerable differences in milk lipid composition have not been studied much in relation to human nutrition.
generally, subclinical or clinical mastitic infections cause the milk contents of casein, lactose and cheese yields to decrease, milk serum albumin, immunoglobulins and salt (nacl) contents to increase.
energy shortage in the diet can change the fatty acid composition of milk fat towards more medium-chain fatty acids, while daily milk yield may decrease and fat content increase (moran-fehr, 1981).

some goat and sheep breeds differ significantly in the frequencies of the polymorphic loci of milk protein types (jordana et al., 1995) (table 7), with considerable processing and nutritional consequences.
effect of freezing and frozen storage on the physico- chemical, organoleptic and microbiological characteristics of a semi-hard ewe milk cheese.
goat milk casein has the same four proteins, alpha-s-1, alpha-s-2, beta and kappa, as cow's milk casein, but genetic differences by breeds and individuals in alpha-s-1 casein range quantitatively from zero or "null type" ( o ) to "low types" ( f, d ) and "very high types" ( a, b, c ), with intermediate classes ( e ).
low alpha-s-1 casein types of goat milk have shorter coagulation time and weaker resistance to heat treatment than high types.

curd firmness at 30 minutes of high type milk is greater than that of low type milk.
the incidence of cow's milk allergy has been found to be about 8 percent or even more in 1-year old infants (host et al., 1988), but goat milk can be a successful treatment in most cases of direct or indirect cow milk allergy (walker, 1964; brenneman, 1978; grezesiak, 1989).
* refers to countries in the mediterranean area (1) includes all milk from cows, buffaloes, ewes and goats.
fat contents in goat milk changed from 2.7 percent in mid-lactation to 4.6 percent during the last week 42 of lactation, protein contents from 3.0 percent to 4.2 percent (voutsinas et al., 1990).
this causes usually higher milk yields, changes in milk fat and protein contents and also different cheese making properties.
it must be understood that in general: (1) milk is the main and hard-to-replace source of dietary ca in human nutrition regardless of whether it is from ewes, goats or cows; (2) milk was never meant to be an adequate source of some minerals like fe or vitamins like c, b12, or folate, which are routinely and cheaply supplemented to daily infant diets from other sources anyway.
the market of ewe and goat milks and their products has essentially three aspects: knowledge of the nutritive values of ewe and goat milks, what causes them to be different or to change, and comparison with cow's and human milks will help each of these markets.
nevertheless, published average data of milk of different species have to be used with caution, because within each species there are great genetic differences due to breeds and selected families, which can be used to market advantage.
in order to produce acceptable yogurt viscosity from cow's milk, firming agents or as much as 5 percent skim milk powder are usually added, which however can increase greatly the lactose content of yogurt to undesirable levels in view of today's' consumers' concern with lactose intolerance (kosikowski, 1985).
somatotropin also will increase milk yield, milk fat content, short-chain and medium-chain fatty acids significantly, while decreasing milk protein percentage, long-chain fatty acids and net energy balance (disenhaus et al., 1995).
many components in ewe or goat milk as in cow's milk, especially fat and protein, are high in colostrum in early lactation, much lower thereafter until they rise again markedly at the end of lactation, when yields are low (anifantakis & kandarakis, 1980).
however, milk secretion in goats is apocrine, while in cows it is merocrine, which explains why goat milk may have very high counts of somatic cells, especially in late lactation milk or in the last strippings of milk, without any relationship to mastitis (park & humphrey, 1986; haenlein, 1993).
contents of total solids, total proteins, casein and phosphorus are higher in high type milk and ph is lower.
this may be the reason, why the popular literature is full of reports of benefits derived from better digestion of goat milk compared to cow's milk.
goats and ewe like other ruminants require a daily minimum of long fiber in the diet to prevent acidotic rumen conditions, which lead to fatal parakeratosis and enterotoxemia, or at least to laminitis, significantly depressed milk fat contents, but also possibly increased milk protein contents (merin et al., 1988).
influence of forage-to-concentrate ratios on intake, digestibility, chewing and milk production of dairy goats.
in order to sell goat and ewe milks and their products for human consumption, their needs and tastes, it is of considerable market advantage to know the factors that cause milk composition to vary and to what extend.
ewe milk is generally much higher in solids contents than goat, cow's or human milks, but composition categories and contents of individual minerals, fatty acids and amino acids vary in different directions between the species, and without relation to higher or lower solids contents.
interest in the nutritive value of goat milk includes all fractions and how they may differ from those in the milk of other species.
contribution to the study of the composition of goat milk.
ewe milk is generally much higher in solids contents than goat, cow's or human milks, but composition categories and contents of individual minerals, fatty acids and amino acids vary in different directions between the species, and without relation to higher or lower solids contents.
it must be emphasized that cow's milks, when ewe or goat milks are compared with them, also have a wide composition range due to breeds, e.g. average holstein milk fat at 3.4 percent versus average jersey milk fat at 5.1 percent, and milk protein from 3.3 percent to 3.9 percent (anifantakis, 1986), besides other breeds.
a major portion of this variation includes negative correlations between milk yield and composition, i.e. low yields have higher contents and vice versa.
the high solids content of ewe milk enables production of superior yogurt compared to cow's and most goat milks.
the composition of ewe and goat milks varies over a wide range because of genetic differences between species, between breeds within species and within breeds.
na from 50 to 56; mg 13 to 15; except k decreased from 170 to 144; and citrate from 145 to 81 mg/100 g. daily variation between morning and evening milkings on the same day the gross composition of milk may also change (simos et al., 1991), which again may be confounded with milk yield levels, when the milking interval between evening and morning milking has more or less hours than between morning and evening milking.
the contents of essential fatty acids also differ in ewe and goat milks compared to human milk, which could be of significance to nursing infants (wright & bolton, 1989; jackson & gibson, 1989) (table5, 6, 9).
the same is true for meeting the needs of essential amino acids, except for methionine, phenylalanine, magnesium, thiamine and niacin, as far as requirements are known.
furthermore, the stage of lactation, daily variation, season, parity, type of diet, physiological status, health of the udder and processing procedures change the contents and levels of major and minor constituents in the milks and its products.
effects of recombinant bovine somatotropin on goat milk yield, composition and plasma metabolites.
mct, especially caprylic (c8:0) and capric (c10:0) have become accepted treatment for patients with malabsorption symptoms, a variety of metabolic disorders, cholesterol problems and infant malnutrition, because of their unique roles of providing energy to the human metabolism instead of lipids to adipose tissues, and because of their ability to limit and dissolve serum cholesterol (kalser, 1971; tantibhedhyangkul & hashim, 1978).
when grain concentrate supplementation makes up more than 50 percent of the daily dry matter intake by goats, decreased chewing, less rumination and a shortage of salivation of rumen contents occurs (kawas et al., 1991).
