i have heard many stories of human babies not being able to handle cow milk, where i know for a fact, that not only can these babies handle goat milk, but they thrive on it.the extra-label use of any medicine in a food producing animal is illegal without a prescription from a veterinarian.goats are so much easier for the small homesteader to handle and they produce, i believe, more milk then a cow for what you put into them (grain, hay & water).any person making the decision to act upon this information is responsible for investigating and understanding the effects of their own actions.also, because not all of the cream rises in goat milk, the milk that has been skimmed of it's cream still tastes just as good as whole milk and can be used for drinking or to make cheese.you can build an inexpensive milkstand from left over wood that will hold the goat for milking and medical care.a cow can be kept on steep land, but because of their weight and size, they will tear the land up, where a goat does not cause much damage to the land itself.goats can be kept on steeper, rougher, land that has trees and brush (they will eat the trees and brush).i know that goat milk has saved human infants lives.this information does not represent the management practices or thinking of other goat breeders and/or the veterinary community.you can have a close, loving, pet relationship with a goat; you cannot, in my experience, have this kind of relationship with a cow.also, bucks (male goats) are much safer than bulls (male cows).the information provided about herbs and the products on this site is not intended to promote any direct or implied health claims.i personally believe that goats are a better choice for a family milker.the statements presented on this site regarding the use of herbs, herbal supplements and formulas have not been evaluated by the food and drug administration.
