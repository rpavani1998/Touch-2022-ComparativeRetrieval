a farmer who boiled or sterilized the milk intended for a calf would be adjudged more or less insane or wholly ignorant - not fit to be a farmer.
casein the nerve and brain builder because casein has been classified with albumen found in milk
in the human kingdom, man is as yet unenlightened or refuses to believe that diet is of supreme importance to human welfare - he is far more concerned with the appearance and taste of what he eats than with its relation to health, normal development of the body, spirituality, success, and happiness; therefore there are being born an increasing number of deficient and deformed children whose parents, otherwise enlightened and cultured, are ready to blame any and every cause for the tragedy, except the right one: food.
for children, the usual procedure is to give lime water directly or add it to the milk.

in a quality of milk there is found nearly one per cent of the organic mineral elements per hundred weight, in the form of calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, iron, etc., cell salts required for the normal functioning of the body.
cottage cheese costs less than one-half the price charged for meats and, considering its food value, would be cheap if three or four times the price of meat were charged for it.
as already stated, cottage cheese is almost a pure casein and is rich in all the essential elements such as the organic mineral elements and vitamins.
these elements, termed cell salts, are tissue builders, tissue preservers, creators of vital energy, stimulators of the ductless glands, and the preventors of disorganization and putrefaction, in much the same manner as ordinary table salt - chloride of sodium - preserves meats and other foods.
when milk is used as a basic food with but little else containing fat included in the diet (as, for example, a menu composed of milk, baked whole potatoes, or whole cereal bread with plenty of vegetables), then whole milk should be used.
when correctly used, it quickly changes the intestinal flora, destroys noxious germ life in the intestinal canal, and is abundantly supplied with mineral elements.
the vital value of a quart of good milk may be estimated to equal that of one pound of the best beef.
the symptoms of poisoning and fever with raising of temperature even to 103 degrees, indicate the normal action of the milk in neutralizing the bodily acids and toxins, eliminating the poisons which had resulted from this neutralization, and equalizing the vital forces.
milk, being coagulated by the digestive juices as a first process of digestion, is actually a more "solid" food than meat.
too many who claim to understand dietetics, have made the mistake of prescribing whole milk in ample quantity and with other foods rich in fats, or of prescribing skim-milk without other basic foods rich in fat.
this fault could be obviated if all feed were first analyzed.
when super-acidity is indicated, a sub-acid fruit such as orange of pineapple, eaten half an hour previous to the milk, will in part counteract the extreme acidity.

milk is considered one of nature's most perfect foods.
when children of one or more years of age cannot take milk, the procedure is more simple, fruit juices being used in the same manner as for adults.
milk contains the organic mineral elements and an abundance of the vitamins, both of which are essential to the normal health and growth of children; it is also the ideal basic diet for those who are suffering from "deficiency" or "wasting" diseases, but when prescribed for these ailments, the whole milk must be used as most of the vitamins are contained in the butterfat.
when it is impossible to obtain a sufficient amount of butterfat, the consequent shortage in vitamin and the organic mineral elements must be offset by the use of a greater amount of milk and a larger proportion of fresh vegetables and fruits; children should be served more tomato and fruit juices between meals.
from all that we have said the conclusion may be arrived at that it is always necessary to serve the whole milk if it is to be a complete substitute for meat.
a rash breaks out on her body, with itching, and she has gone into convulsions, even when milk was modified according to the prescribed formula."
the acid present caused too rapid coagulation with excessively large lumps of curd; and this condition may be so severe as to cause gas and the distension of the stomach, which in turn induces fever and convulsions.
many soups may be prepared with milk as a base but care should be taken that the milk is added just before serving; if it boils, the albumen is coagulated and over-heating might also destroy the vitamin though it would have little or no effect on the organic mineral elements.
when mother's milk, which of course is best, is unavailable, goat's milk should be substituted; failing this, cow's is the next best.
buttermilk differs but slightly from skim-milk.
casein easily replaces all other forms of protein and this is the reason for its great value as a fundamental constructive agent in the diseases mentioned.
in this respect it is radically different from all manufactured sugars which are only partly absorbed and are actually, in most cases, treated in the system as foreign substances.
this fault could be obviated if all feed were first analyzed.
milk is a sub-acid food and if the system is in a sub-acid state then it is not acceptable and may not even be coagulated in the usual manner by the digestive juices, the digestion being so long delayed that it becomes almost like a poison.
then one-half hour before the next feeding give the lime water and when it is time for feeding, give the milk and lime water, this method, plus a little patience and common sense, will overcome the worst case.
it is a food of great value to children and adults not only because of its energy-producing power in concentrated and easily digested form, but also because it is the carrier of an animal or vitalized vitamin which is found in sufficient abundance in no other fat; vegetable and nut fats contain it to a slight degree.
the albumen in the milk would probably be partly coagulated."
the process therefore is proved to be useless and destructive.
it is rich in carbon and hydrogen.
in malnutrition, tuberculosis, intestinal affectons and especially toxo-absorption, if skim-milk is not easily accepted by the digestive organism, buttermilk is the ideal food-drink.
these foods supply all the vital mineral elements, material for nerve and brain development; growth proceeds normally, and it is practically impossible for mental or physical weaknesses to develop.
it contains practically all the elements required by the economy of man to build bone, muscle, nerves, and brain; in sugar of milk are found the elements which furnish heat and energy sufficient to keep the human machine functioning.
young animals fed on milk develop rapidly and normally, show strength and vitality; those fed on substitutes for milk, however perfect these substitutes appear to be, are usually more or less weak, sickly and in some manner undeveloped.
the skim-milk is allowed to sour or clabber and then heated to body temperature until it separates from the whey; it is drained, salted to taste, and softened with a little sweet milk or cream.

in some cases of milk intoleration the action of the liver may be at fault, being either sluggish or over-active.
due to this fact, it is best that fresh milk be served to children and invalids, and if it is still so fresh as to be warm from the cow, it is at its best for all cases in which vitality is extremely low.
they are free from disease-creative constituents but are deficient in the important elements contained in milk fats and other fats, and become dangerous to health if wholly substituted for dairy butter in the dietary of children and invalids.
albumen is found also in the white of eggs and if the eggs are fertilized, it is even more vital and concentrated, provided the eggs are fresh.
the real cause is seldom found in the milk, though occasionally a stomach is found which will not tolerate it and in which toleration cannot be established.
a physician who has had experience will know that instead of being a poison, the milk is actually acting beneficially for the patient.

deformity in a young child or animal, except when caused by accident, indicates that during the period of gestation the mother subsisted on food deficient in these vital elements, this lack preventing the unborn body from developing harmoniously.
it is a far more complete food than meat.
therefore, if the milk is wisely continued for a sufficient length of time, the symptoms will gradually subside, rash disappear, temperature go to normal, and it will be found that toleration has been established.
milk contains warmth and energy-creating material, protein and casein, which renew or build nerves and tissues, and the large percentage of cell salts vital for repair and equalization of the entire organism.
these elements are found in abundance in many vegetables, grains, legumes, fruits, and nuts, but are contained in their richest state in cow's and goat's milk.
when super-acidity is indicated, a sub-acid fruit such as orange of pineapple, eaten half an hour previous to the milk, will in part counteract the extreme acidity.
in some cases of milk intoleration the action of the liver may be at fault, being either sluggish or over-active.
it repairs and builds tissue, stimulates the cells of the body to greater activity and acts as a natural tonic without stimulation; to the nerves and brain it is a food beyond compare.
the acid present caused too rapid coagulation with excessively large lumps of curd; and this condition may be so severe as to cause gas and the distension of the stomach, which in turn induces fever and convulsions.

in either case, results are disastrous, and the diet is condemned rather than the real cause - the food combinations.
eggs, peas, beans and lentils contain these elements but they are not as easily digested not as readily assimilated.
though a perfectly balanced food, milk alone is too concentrated to maintain health in grown people - cellulose is needed and eliminating agents; these are secured by the free use of vegetables, and of fruit between meals.
milk and other fats: the difference between milk fat and other fats in their relation to the growth of the young and the health-controlling qualities in the case of adults, is due to the presence in the mild fat of a larger proportion of the elusive but active substances known as vitamins, as well as of a more abundant supply of organic mineral elements.
sugar of milk is one of the most desirable of all the energy-producing agents, because, like whole milk, it does not long remain in the stomach but mixes readily with water and albumen, and the system quickly absorbs it.
