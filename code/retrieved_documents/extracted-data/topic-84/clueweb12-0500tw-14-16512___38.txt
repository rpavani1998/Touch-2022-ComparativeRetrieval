there are far worse things in milk than growth hormones.
another important thing is, hormones are proteins which we know proteins are unwound and broken down in our stomach so it would not have any effect on the rest of our body because we break it down then use it for what we need it for.
if you think bgh has no effect on you, go look at girls in south america who are nowdays developing breasts at age 10.
when it comes to building muscle, though, whole milk may  be your best choice: scientists at the university of texas medical branch in  galveston found that drinking whole milk after lifting weights boosted muscle  protein synthesisâ€”an indicator of muscle  growthâ€”2.8 times more than drinking skim did.

how about this: you lot can go ahead and swallow the "information" the food-companies are feeding you and eat your genetically modified meat-products and produce.

it is not difficult to deduct the problems associated with the industries who expose innocent americans to the poisonous promulgation of a product that should be condemned.
ehm, it is this thing ...
i just belive that whatever cow or goat you want milk from, its not good for you.
at least they didn't preach to stop drinking milk, just to drink organic milk if you can afford it.
i still drink right from the sourse.
i know milk is not good for human comsumption
they then went on to suggest that it might just be from what we feed/give to our cattle (such as hormones), which directly goes into the milk that we drink.
good health to you all...milk free of course.
i'm sure there are things everywhere that we add to our environment that aren't good for us.

the (igf-i) which is what we would be looking at is the same in bst treated cows as in regular cows.
my point: men have improved on nature.
and the argument that "what other animals drink milk after infancy?"
you won't see any because mothers stop lactating naturally.
when you grow up you have to drink beer.
i would only drink/eat milk if affordable & i wasn't fearful of the stuff.
however, it's worth noting that these men drank six 8-ounce glasses a day, an unusually high amount.

primitive tribes have none of the problems that we have owing to our 'western' diet.
i can and will drink up to a gallon of milk every two days.
so, calves aren't the only mammals that were intended to suck on cows?

i can do 50 push-ups per set and i have done up to 20 sets at a regular workout at a time and still run 5 miles a day and do my other exercises with no problem.
what other animals drink milk after infancy?
i went to the notmilk site and am sick that we continue to buy into this "does a body good" marketing campaign.
now i wouldn't say to stay away from milk completely, i have sinus issues and milk makes them worse, but i'll have yogurt nearly everyday.
people can be so easily manipulated/brainwashed into believing bs and will never believe anything else on the topic that isn't what they want to hear.
if milk is as bad for your health as some people want you to believe then anybody that drinks it should be dead by 30 and if not they would have serious health problems.
every animal deserves a free, long life...not to be stockpiled by us only to be eaten.
human beings are the only mammals on the face of the planet that drink the milk of another animal, for nutritional value.
and you nut who says genitically modified food is good should go bury your head in the sand because you are totally wrong.
that letter really nails it all.
off my high-horse now.
are there any disadvantages inherent to drinking it instead of regular milk?
i agree that there is way too much concern over things like pesticides and hormones in our food.
milk has very high concentration of nutrients that is necessary for the growth of baby.
if you cotinue to drink at the same time eating regular amount of solid food you end up taking in too much of fat and colesterol that will cause many health problems such as heart attack, stroke and cancer...
the only nutrient thats good for you in it is protien.
when mum told me that it ringed a bell in my head that there is a reason that most humans are alergic for milk.

if milk was so bad, there would serious sickness everywhere.
i don't drink milk, but i love cottage cheese (lots of casein).
how many 'death by milk' results have anyone heard of?
you probably did not consume enough water and gym atmospheres tend to have a cool air temperature, perfect for sinus drainage when not warmed up.
in fact, i've kinda got an hankerin for it now... notmilk.com is a little radical.
please, please, please tell me that you did not just publish, "you can purchase antibiotic-free (and typically hormone-free, as well) milk..."
well i have been drinking milk and i have been eating cheese since i was a little boy,and i am 51yrs old.
you will notice though that this ad is published in tons of online journals, and is really similar to tv commericals about cows milk.
until i find out how i;m doing i will try and refrain from eating any of the above, or at least a minimal amount of usage we don't need the hormones or antibiotics that milk has and we can't digest the lactose and the calcium in it is casinate which 99% of people can't absorb any way....
seriously, backing up your claims with wikipedia.
the prostate/breast cancer statistics are indicative of the beef/milk connection, the path being, (a) women on the pill, who excrete "their" hormones along with (b)"urine" from the hormone laden beef/dairy "cattle," into the "surface water" which "cannot" be eliminated.(popular science).
the thing is a train wreck: unprofessional, in poor taste, and a little bit sad.
when it comes to building muscle, though, whole milk may be your best choice: scientists at the university of texas medical branch in galveston found that drinking whole milk after lifting weights boosted muscle protein synthesisâan indicator of muscle growthâ2.8 times more than drinking skim did.
however i am still here typing this as healthy as a horse never went to hospital except when i was 8 to get my tonsils out.
ah, found this http://www.rawfoodexplained.com/why-we-should-not-eat-animal-products/the-d igestion-of-milk.html i don't know if these are claims you've already refuted.
of course, that's easy in today's sensationalistic society.
young girls are also over-developed for their age category while keeping in mind that the human brain matures at 25.
you have an interesting set up of the article.
@carlos oliveira, lol.
in summary i have come to the conclusion that cow's/goat's milk is totally unnecessary for human consumption.
not only that, but he conducts research and has articles published in peer reviewed journals.
but with that arguement, we could all smoke for most of our lives and live to 100 like george burns.
it's a long letter but his findings also agree with what i have discovered/uncovered all this time.
in nature baby stops drinking milk as soon as their tooth grows.
btw, they make soya milk which is just as good as cow milk., actually better, it even lasts longer so yeh.
get off the milk and live healthy, stop consuming everything the fda says is healthy, people!
are any of the effects/benefits of milk altered through consumption of lactose-free as opposed to regular?
i was worried when one of my profs at university tried to connect how there seems to be an increase in the amount of young boys growing exceptionally quickly today, when compared to the past.
only two of the five subsections actually deal with things about milk that are unhealthy.
what a load of crap!
calvs have to go up like 45 kg in one summer.
while you've probably always been told to drink reduced-fat milk, the majority of scientific studies show that drinking whole milk actually improves cholesterol levels, just not as much as drinking skim does.
we don't have this big health care controversy right in this country now because we are so healthy.
i am so tired of hearing that everything that we eat, or drink is bad for us.
that said, all milk contains hormones!
which is healthier........
i am more likely to believe that your 'stopped working out' had more to do with it disappearing than cutting out the milk.
medical billing and coding of course americans are unhealthy but it's not because of milk.
i can't be bothered with this debate anymore.
also, as i said before that the china project was conduct 30 years ago, knowledge and scientific methods in just about every field has evolved immensely in that time period.
how about the fact that that bovine hormones increase the amount of pus in excreted into your milk.
so if you need milk for cereal or baking then get fat free lactose free milk and lactose free ice cream and there is now lactose free string cheese.
too much of a good thing can be bad.
what about lactose-free milk?
what would you do if your lady just gave her milk to cows?
how can you not be concerned about what you eat?
that is until she wakes up and slaps me.....
from now on, i shall delete all mail from men's health without opening it.
to date the biggest information i have had about milk is that it can lead to cancer, depending on the one you choose.
all that concern about hormones in our foods are coming from the uneducated.
they have the majority or people over 50 on tablets every day that they don't even need and are bad for their health.
they all say that milk makes the skeleton stronger, but vegetables does that, not milk, thats what ive heard.
included are research and news articles from a diverse group of sources including those who would benefit from the sale of milk and milk products.
pus...yes pus, bacteria and hormones are rife in this white cocktail for calves.
it depends on your taste.
dean above is a prime example.
by the time they reach 11-13 years of age, they are already over 6' tall, which they think is "unnatural".
rather than restating aspects of milk that are healthy, you should debunk the ideas people publish that are detrimental to milk's image.
oh the hype... it's so sad how far removed the majority of people are from agriculture.
well now i know that was a load of horsesh*t
i had no idea there existed such a wealth of reaearch about milk and it's potential negative health effects.
go eat some fruits and veggies folks!
however, it's worth noting that these men drank six  8-ounce glasses a day, an unusually high amount.
so smoking must not be bad for your health either?
but milk, it is good.
the study relied heavily on recall questionnaires and many of the study's conclusions were derived from data, that was by the study's own admission, not statistically significant.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/somatic_cell_count this is not the first time i have seen misinformation in this publication, i begin to wonder if men's health is not owned by people with interest in meat and dairy industries...it should be called "men's un-health"!
my friend's asthma improved a lot when he swapped cow's milk for goat's milk.
thank you, men's health.
and from what i've sen and read, guys need dairy as much as women, especially to keep their bones stronger when old age sets in.
how is saying "milk is not natural" propoganda when you are watching all these milk and dairy adverts on tv, trying to sell products and believing in everything they say?
but here is a question: why does the nation that promotes, produces, and consumes the most milk on planet earth, have by far the highest rate of osteoporosis of any other nation?
thanks for the great article.
then why would you drink milk from other animals ???
to cut a long research story short, readers here should check out "dr. kradjian milk letter" and yes it is also listed on notmilk.com web site.
i always appreciate your no-nonsense research based articles.
try soy milk, or better yet, almond milk!
you can either beleive the industry about how good milk is for you or go and research the countries where milk is consumed in greater quanties and analyse the data for osteoporosis, breast cancer, prostate cancer etc.
with milk as a staple of this so called great diet, it does contribute to these illnesses.

surely if mother nature wanted "us" to drink milk as adults, we'd be visiting our mother with much greater frequency.
there is a good amount of calcium and other important nutrients in veggies like broccoli, kale, spinach, etc. also, not trying to sound all hippy-like here, bit does anyone ever think about the fact that we are stockpiling these cows in extremely unsanitary conditions, feeding them crap, with them lying and rolling around in their own crap, and then eating them and drinking what comes from there nasty infected utters?
and i have not been told that i have cancer, or anything else wrong with me.
for those who are really concerned about milk with bovine growth hormones and the like you can avoid this by going to whole foods and purchasing their 365 store brand milk.
briefly, we drink/drank milk out of habit from childhood.
no one seems to be able to make up their minds as to what is good or what is bad for us humans.
seth and all who agree with him: i am appalled by the statement that "there is too much concern about what's in our food."
there are some good alternitive milks you can buy and they aren't from a cow.
@gary, you are right that america is an embarrassment to the world in terms of health because of the diet they have, but you can't just say it is because of milk.
while you've probably always been told to  drink reduced-fat milk, the majority of scientific studies show that drinking  whole milk actually improves cholesterol levels, just not as much as drinking  skim does.
ps: i also will no longer buy your mag.
we over the years have adapted to drink milk into adulthood becuase we realize the use of milk as a source of nutrition.
it's amazing how supposedly educated people can make comments like "if milk was really unhealthy, we would have all types of health problems"...
alan is a respected and well educated member in the nutritional field.
not only is the dairy industry the largest in america, i believe that now our government is the dairy industry.
so don't attribute it to milk.
people are forgetting that milk is for babies who do not have their teeth yet.
how about the increased phlegm associated with drinking dairy?
http://lookforbedbugs.com/yeast-free/ robert w is absolutely right!
americans are lazy and fat.
prove, proved, proven scientists have proven ....
we think it's okay to drink cow's milk, but not human milk!
some people have a vested interest in scaring people; some people are just paranoid.
they are not going to tell you the negative side of dairy.
also, would drinking the hormone free options remove the need to drink lactose-free milk?
i personally had a liver transplant and have heart problems and was told in both instances to drink about 1 quart of milk a day in order to strenghten my heart and boost my immune system as it is weakened due to medication.
we'll see who's healthier 30 years down the road.
milk is acidic to the body...cancer feeds on acid.
i also agree that mens health should start listing references...
drinking a gallon daily will probally cause problems but i would trade any food or drink for milk.
you spoke about the colored toxic water the fda approves as "milk".
good to see that there are some smart and successful people from there (unlike the misc section).
fact is, humans are the only mammals who continue to drink milk past infancy, and it's not even milk from our own species!
the bottom line: drinking two to three glasses of milk a day, whether it's skim, 2 percent, or whole, lowers the likelihood of both heart attack and strokeâa finding confirmed by british scientists.
i am still skeptical about both sides.
and for the 50 year old...wow it's great that you can drink all of that milk and be healthy.
i am 50 years old and am in the best shape of my life.
thank you for this article i can finally have my milk in peace.
but it sucks because im lactose intolerant and i puke.
if milk is that bad for your health then i should be dead 20 years ago.
so much so i can hardly believe they have any real science at all.
i have been drinking milk for 50 years.
horse milk, monkey milk, rabbit milk?
i have studied the "milk" issue for the past two years.
the only reason antibiotic use is a problem is because bacteria in the animal can adapt.
we are all going to die of something so let judy call it
they also happen to be an environmentalist, so i am not really surprised.
so when you people that want to say that something is bad for us to consume, please post all of your proof before you go and make these allegations.
for example, how many people even think about drinking out of plastic and what the plastic may give off?
text size it depends on your taste.
so the antibiotics become less effective with that bacteria in humans and animals.
so yes just about everything else stops drinking milk, but we don't rely on instinct nearly as much.
that pretty much sums up where we are as a society.
it's called "unsubscribe" all i can say is if milk was in fact as horrible for you as some people make it out to be, i think we as a society would know this by now and be able to clearly link consuming milk to certain diseases or what have you.
male fish have been and are developing "female characteristics."
regardless of whether or not r-bst is injected in any cow in this country, or world for that matter, you will never know because r-bst is a hormone naturally created by the cow and it is undetectable.
just something to think about...
the ones who want to cut world population to half what it is currently.
yeah, i suppose they're especially interested in educating the public about milk, milk products and their friends.

if you care about your health you should read "the china study" people, i drink milk like a bandit.
or have heart surgery?
funny how milk is promoted as being good for osteoporosis...and to say that there is no hormones in milk lol not only is there hormones, there is also measureable amounts of blood and pus and there is a leaglly permitted amount so if there wasnt then they would not stipulate an acceptable amount...
when do you think the cancer will show up?
so, i don't think that milk is for us humans.
you're nothing but a shill for the dairy industry, mr. aragon.
:i i was never much of a milk drinker growing up (still had some, i was raised in the midwest, so it was nearly impossible to avoid), and since i have went to college, graduated and moved on (playing multiple sports all the way through, mind you), i have never broken a bone.
