pasteurization destroys enzymes, diminishes vitamin content, denatures fragile milk proteins, alters vitamin b12, and vitamin b6, kills beneficial bacteria, promotes pathogens and is associated with allergies, increased tooth decay, colic in infants, growth problems in children, osteoporosis, arthritis, heart disease and cancer.(2) heat alters milk’s amino acids lysine and tyrosine, making the whole complex of proteins less available; it promotes rancidity of unsaturated fatty acids and destruction of vitamins.pasteurization destroys enzymes, diminishes vitamin content, denatures fragile milk proteins, alters vitamin b12, and vitamin b6, kills beneficial bacteria, promotes pathogens and is associated with allergies, increased tooth decay, colic in infants, growth problems in children, osteoporosis, arthritis, heart disease and cancer.(2)this, and the fact that pasteurized milk puts an unnecessary strain on the pancreas to produce digestive enzymes, may explain why milk consumption in societies that drink pasteurized milk has been linked with diabetes.(3) pasteurization destroys all the enzymes in milk -- in fact, the test for successful pasteurization is absence of enzymes.if using raw milk, it must be handled correctly, everything must be sanitary and the animals that the milk comes from should all be healthy and happy.pasteurization is the sterilization of liquids such as milk, orange juice, wine, and beer, as well as cheese, to destroy disease-causing and other undesirable bacteria/organisms.there is some evidence that pasteurization alters lactose, making it more readily absorbable.goat milk is more completely and easily absorbed than cows milk leaving less residue behind in the colon where it can literally ferment and cause problems.the milk has good bacteria which can fight off any dangerous or bad bacteria present in the milk or that may fall into the milk.pasteurization alters milk’s mineral components such as calcium, chlorine, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, sodium and sulfur as well as many trace minerals, making them less available.goat milk contains more essential fatty acids (linoleic & archidoic acids) and higher proportion of short chain and medium chainfatty acids than cows milk.mechanically homogenized milk has been linked to heart disease.(2)without them, protein and calcium are more difficult to utilize and possibly toxic.if you pasteurize the milk, thus killing the good bacteria, then any bad bacteria that may manage to get into the milk will multiply and grow quickly, because pasteurized milk is the prefect medium for bacteria to grow and there is no longer any good bacteria present to fight the bad bacteria off.once heated, milk becomes rotten, with precipitated minerals that can’t be absorbed (hence osteoporosis), with sugars that can’t be digested (hence allergies), and with fats that are toxic.goat milk provides 13% more calcium, 25% more vit b-6, 47% more vit a, 134% more potassium and 350% more niacin than cow milk.
