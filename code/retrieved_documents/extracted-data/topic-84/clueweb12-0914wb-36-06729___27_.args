this provides, therefore, considerable potential to tailor-make ewe and goat milks according to the needs and preferences of consumers, and to provide an alternative to cow's milk, where this is economically or medically advantageous.this gives much support to the contention that improved ewe and goat milk production is one of the best strategies to relieve human starvation, undernutrition and malnutrition and therefore has great market growth potential, incentive and justification, especially in areas where pasture conditions, climate, mountainous terrain and economic conditions favor small ruminants.this will be even more important in the future, when it becomes better known how to change original farm milk composition by manipulating e.g. the feeding of goats and ewes in order to tailor-make milk to the needs of diet conscious and disease afflicted consumers and their children, and to satisfy consumers with higher incomes, who have developed a sophisticated connoisseur taste for goat and ewe milk products.the incidence of cow's milk allergy has been found to be about 8 percent or even more in 1-year old infants (host et al., 1988), but goat milk can be a successful treatment in most cases of direct or indirect cow milk allergy (walker, 1964; brenneman, 1978; grezesiak, 1989).the high solids content of ewe milk makes it generally superior to goat or cow milk for processing into cheese and yogurt, because of higher yield and firmer processing quality without additives.in order to sell goat and ewe milks and their products for human consumption, their needs and tastes, it is of considerable market advantage to know the factors that cause milk composition to vary and to what extend.goat and ewe milk exceed cow's milk significantly in most short, medium chain, mono-unsaturated, poly-unsaturated and essential fatty acids (table5 and 6), which are valuable to today's health conscious consumer.it must be understood that in general: (1) milk is the main and hard-to-replace source of dietary ca in human nutrition regardless of whether it is from ewes, goats or cows; (2) milk was never meant to be an adequate source of some minerals like fe or vitamins like c, b12, or folate, which are routinely and cheaply supplemented to daily infant diets from other sources anyway.therefore, goat or ewe butter, ghee and related products, with their enriched concentration of mct and other fatty acids, have considerable market potential (hachelaf et al., 1993), and their unique roles in nutrition and medicine should be a thankful area for researchers to explore (haenlein, 1992).goat milk on the other hand, in some countries, is consumed as fluid milk, even on a commercial basis, besides being processed into dairy products.some goat milk has low casein contents and unsatisfactory rennet coagulation ability, which affects cheese yield (remeuf & lenoir, 1986; ambrosoli et al., 1988).high type has higher cheese yield, better curd firmness, which is associated with lower ph. despite longer coagulation time, goat milk of the high alpha-s-1 casein type is more suitable for cheese making because of firmer curd, higher casein content, less intense goat flavor and smoother cheese texture, yet it may be that low type has the advantage in human digestion.winter climate can affect milk yields and composition, and both are negatively correlated.in order to produce acceptable yogurt viscosity from cow's milk, firming agents or as much as 5 percent skim milk powder are usually added, which however can increase greatly the lactose content of yogurt to undesirable levels in view of today's' consumers' concern with lactose intolerance (kosikowski, 1985).however, milk secretion in goats is apocrine, while in cows it is merocrine, which explains why goat milk may have very high counts of somatic cells, especially in late lactation milk or in the last strippings of milk, without any relationship to mastitis (park & humphrey, 1986; haenlein, 1993).
