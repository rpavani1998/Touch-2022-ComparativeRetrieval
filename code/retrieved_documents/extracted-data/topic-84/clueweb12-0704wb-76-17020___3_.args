perhaps one of goat milks most famous attributes, low allergenicity, is vital to keeping each patient in optimum health.goat milk has a similarity to human milk that is unmatched in bovine (cow) milk, which may be at the root of goat milks healing properties.in addition to highly digestible protein, goat milk contains far more digestion-friendly oligosaccharides (prebiotics).14 goat milk also has an abundance of the energy substrate adenosine triphosphate(atp) that far exceeds bovine milk.15 atp is the energy currency that our metabolism is constantly manufacturing, used for every cellular reaction in the body.biological resemblance to human milk: goat milk has a similarity to human milk that is unmatched in bovine (cow) milk, which may be at the root of goat milk’s healing properties.evidence points, however, to the lower allergic potential of goat milk when compared with cow milk.4, 6, 9 one study found that nearly 93 percent of infants suffering from cow milk allergies were able to tolerate and thrive on goat milk.7 another animal model study concluded that "goat milk, when used as the first source of protein after a breastfeeding period, is less allergenic than cow milk."8in addition to highly digestible protein, goat milk contains far more digestion-friendly oligosaccharides (prebiotics).14 goat milk also has an abundance of the energy substrate adenosine triphosphate(atp) that far exceeds bovine milk.15 atp is the energy “currency” that our metabolism is constantly manufacturing, used for every cellular reaction in the body.goat milk, like human milk, contains low levels of allergy-causingalphas1 casein and high levels of alphas2 casein, which is non-allergy-causing.while soy milk has been touted as a safe alternative to cow milk, some studies show that those with a cow milk allergy have a 47-percent chance of also being allergic to soy milk.10 digestion is defined as catabolism (break-down) of food into elemental food particles (fats, proteins, carbohydrates) in the stomach, while absorption is the uptake of the food particles in the small intestine.hives, wheezing, vomiting, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, skin rash (commonly near and around the mouth), runny nose, watery eyes, colic in infants and even anaphylactic shock can all be signs and symptoms of a cow milk allergy.allergies to foods such as cow milk also affect adults.goat milk has extensive healing properties.these prebiotics are on the cutting edge of digestive health.research shows that goat milk has better digestibility, buffering capacity and alkalinity than cow milk.1,12 several properties testify to the superiority of goat milk.while soy milk has been touted as a safe alternative to cow milk, some studies show that those with a cow milk allergy have a 47-percent chance of also being allergic to soy milk.10 rapid digestion and complete absorption: digestion is defined as catabolism (break-down) of food into elemental food particles (fats, proteins, carbohydrates) in the stomach, while absorption is the uptake of the food particles in the small intestine.as chiropractors, we must keep ourselves on the cutting edge of nutritional supplementation.
