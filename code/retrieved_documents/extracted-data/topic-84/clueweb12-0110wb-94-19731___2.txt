type i (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and cow milk: casein variant consumption.
a softer  casein curd with smaller flakes could be expected to result in more rapid  digestion of milk proteins, and this was confirmed in vitro by jasinka  (1995).

it appears that when fat globules are forcibly broken up by mechanical means, it allows an enzyme associated with milk fat, known as xanthine oxidase to become free and penetrate the intestinal wall.
these results are not surprising when the impact of alpha-s1-casein is considered on cheese manufacture.
commercial  efforts are now being made to select and farm cows which only contain a2  beta-casein, which is considered the safe variant of beta-casein.
this was attributed to the greater level of  beta-casein, and lower level of alpha-s1-casein, in human and goat milk  casein.
this is a key reason why goat milk is considered more easily digestible than cow milk.
these smaller sized fat globules provide a better dispersion, and a more homogeneous mixture of fat in the milk - higher amount of shorter-chain fatty acids in the milk fat of goats:.
goat milk protein reduces the chances of contracting diabetes and  other health problems: goat milk contains a2 beta-casein, not the a1  beta-casein that cow’s milk contains.
goat milk is 2% curd (which  precipitates in the stomach) as compared with 10% curd in cow milk.
digestion of milk proteins from cow or goat milk infant formula.
diabetologia, 42:292-296.
goat milk only contains the a2 variant of beta-casein, and is therefore a natural choice for those seeking to avoid a1 beta-casein - natural homogenization: goat milk is already homogenized: the natural homogenization of goat milk is, from a human health standpoint, much better than the mechanically homogenized cow milk product.

they suggested that the higher levels of mct's (medium chain tricglycerides) in goat milk could account for the improved absorption of iron, and that the higher levels of amino acids cysteine and lysine could also be a factor - natural homogenization: goat milk is already homogenized: the natural homogenization of goat milk is, from a human health standpoint, much better than the mechanically homogenized cow milk product.
goat milk protein is more easily digested than cow milk protein: the curd in goat milk is small and light, hence easily digested.
this is a key reason  why goat milk is considered more easily digestible than cow milk.

recent research published in  february, 2003 has implicated the protein a1 beta-casein as a trigger for type  1 diabetes and other health issues (elliott et al, 1999).
once xanthine oxidase gets through the  intestinal wall and into the bloodstream, it is capable of creating scar damage  to the heart and arteries, which in turn may stimulate the body to release  cholesterol into the blood in an attempt to lay a protective fatty material on  the scarred areas.

furthermore, glycerol ethers are much higher in goat than in cow milk which appears to be important for the nutrition of the nursing newborn.

- alkalinity vs. acidity: the reaction of goat milk is alkaline, the same as mother's milk.
this can lead to arteriosclerosis.
similarly, park et al (1986) showed that anemic rats fed goat milk had  higher liver weights and efficiency of hemaglobin regeneration than those given  cow milk, consistent with the greater bioavailability of iron in goat  milk.

a firmer curd is required for cheese  manufacture in order to achieve desired consistency and yields, as with  cow milk and its high level of alpha-s1-casein.
