according to real milk: pasteurization destroys enzymes, diminishes vitamin content, denatures fragile milk proteins, destroys vitamins c, b12 and b6, kills beneficial bacteria, promotes pathogens and is associated with allergies, increased tooth decay, colic in infants, growth problems in children, osteoporosis, arthritis, heart disease and cancer.homogenized milk has been linked to heart disease.coconut milk contains amounts of coconut oil in it, which has wonderful anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-cancer and thyroid and weight loss benefits.high phytate diets have caused growth problems in children.finding a local source to purchase raw milk straight from the cow or goat are the best alternatives.we feel good about this decision, and that we are well within the boundaries of obeying our authorities and yet still doing the best we can for our family.unless you have your own cow and know for yourself about the hygenic methods used to milk it and store it you cannot be certain it will not harm you and your children.evidence shows that store-bought milk is actually more harmful than raw.it is a struggle for us because we firmly believe that not only is raw milk better, but that conventional milk is actually harmful.yes, it may very well be better for the environment, and a means of taking better care of the animals, but are the health claims correct?raw milk can save money for many because it has multiple uses – you can make homemade butter, yogurt, kefir, and the like.they would pay weekly or monthly to be part owner of the cow and, naturally as owner, get some of the milk.when my son was two weeks old i noticed a lot of digestive problems and through elimination discovered he had a sensitivity to cow’s milk and soy.i have heard that pasteurized conventional milk can cause milk allergies.that way you could own say 1% of the cow and since you own part of it, you could enjoy the milk legally.
