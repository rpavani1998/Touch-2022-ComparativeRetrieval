it also supports a more natural, sanitary and less stressful environment for the cow, the farmer and the world at large while promoting local foods and respect for and connection to the animals and their farms we consume from.it is also a good idea to sometimes 'refresh' your grains by giving them some good whole fat milk every month or so just to increase the likelihood that they will maintain their strength and health in their other liquid (though this is not always necessary - some people have had great success doing just purely soy etc - just watch your grains and adjust to their needs).as far as we're concerned it only makes sense that milk in its natural form has more to offer and is sometimes better digested or tolerated.some people with cancer have even experimented fermenting human milk as a medicinal therapy.besides the fact that it will most likely be coming from a cow that is not confined (thus less stress and other issues like growth hormones), raw milk is much healthier and some argue it tastes much better, too.you will want to be sure that the cow is healthy and the owner is using sanitary methods to ensure your milk is safe.it contains many more enzymes and natural healthy bacteria of its own, the proteins have not been cooked, and the fat has not been homogenized.raw milk is really the optimal way to consume milk if you can find a reliable trusty-worthy local source.this way your grains themselves are never in contact with your other liquid, and continue to grow and thrive in their milk, while at the same time producing a starter you can use in the other liquid.if you need to have the other liquid (rather than milk) and your grains seem to struggle, you will mostly likely have to keep a 'mother source' in the milk, creating new healthy grains that you can continuously use in the new liquid and dispose of.these enzymes and bacteria are sensitive to heat and unfortunately destroyed during the pasturization process.its possible to ferment all forms of mammalian milk (mare, goat, sheep, cow, buffalo, camel etc).artificial sweeteners will not provide kefir with the calories or nutrients it needs to live.yes, but experiment carefully as some things may hinder or even harm the grains (some foods contain natural antibacterial properties, such as grapefruit).kefir can also in a pinch be made from re-hydrated dry milk, or uht (ultra-pastuerized) milk, though they are not the best options for continued grain health.
