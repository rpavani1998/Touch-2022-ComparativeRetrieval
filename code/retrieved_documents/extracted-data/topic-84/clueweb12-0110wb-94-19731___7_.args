furthermore, glycerol ethers are much higher in goat than in cow milk which appears to be important for the nutrition of the nursing newborn.they suggested that the higher levels of mct's (medium chain tricglycerides) in goat milk could account for the improved absorption of iron, and that the higher levels of amino acids cysteine and lysine could also be a factor - natural homogenization: goat milk is already homogenized: the natural homogenization of goat milk is, from a human health standpoint, much better than the mechanically homogenized cow milk product.goat milk protein reduces the chances of contracting diabetes and other health problems: goat milk contains a2 beta-casein, not the a1 beta-casein that cow’s milk contains.they suggested that the higher levels of mct's (medium chain tricglycerides) in goat milk could account for the improved absorption of iron, and that the higher levels of amino acids cysteine and lysine could also be a factor natural homogenization: goat milk is already homogenized: the natural homogenization of goat milk is, from a human health standpoint, much better than the mechanically homogenized cow milk product.goat milk only contains the a2 variant of beta-casein, and is therefore a natural choice for those seeking to avoid a1 beta-casein natural homogenization: goat milk is already homogenized: the natural homogenization of goat milk is, from a human health standpoint, much better than the mechanically homogenized cow milk product.goat milk only contains the a2 variant of beta-casein, and is therefore a natural choice for those seeking to avoid a1 beta-casein - natural homogenization: goat milk is already homogenized: the natural homogenization of goat milk is, from a human health standpoint, much better than the mechanically homogenized cow milk product.this is a key reason why goat milk is considered more easily digestible than cow milk.similarly, park et al (1986) showed that anemic rats fed goat milk had higher liver weights and efficiency of hemaglobin regeneration than those given cow milk, consistent with the greater bioavailability of iron in goat milk.- goat milk protein reduces the chances of contracting diabetes and other health problems: goat milk contains a2 beta-casein, not the a1 beta-casein that cows milk contains.a firmer curd is required for cheese manufacture in order to achieve desired consistency and yields, as with cow milk and its high level of alpha-s1-casein.a firmer curd is required for cheese manufacture in order to achieve desired consistency and yields, as with cow milk and its high level of alpha-s1-casein.it should be noted that this effect is not a problem with natural (unhomogenized) cow milk - superior micronutrient absorption compared with cow milk.once xanthine oxidase gets through the intestinal wall and into the bloodstream, it is capable of creating scar damage to the heart and arteries, which in turn may stimulate the body to release cholesterol into the blood in an attempt to lay a protective fatty material on the scarred areas.goat milk protein is more easily digested than cow milk protein: the curd in goat milk is small and light, hence easily digested.goat milk is 2% curd (which precipitates in the stomach) as compared with 10% curd in cow milk.
