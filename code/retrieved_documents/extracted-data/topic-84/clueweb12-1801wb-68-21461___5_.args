the predominant milk protein (casein) in goat milk is slightly closer in composition to human milk than cow milk is, and thus may be easier to tolerate and digest for some individuals.goat milk is significantly lower in folic acid and vitamin b-12 than cow milk, so make sure you eating plenty of leafy greens and foods such as meat and chicken, or supplement if relying on goat milk for nutrition.it is the most comprehensive resource out there on the differences in milk allergies and intolerances and what people can do to regain their health.there aren’t any firm numbers, but it’s been estimated that roughly 20 to 40% of milk allergic individuals do not react to goat milk products.the milks from different mammals have slightly different compositions, which is why some people may be allergic to cow milk but able to tolerate goat milk.human milk is obviously the least allergenic milk for humans, as it is “designed” specifically for our bodies.however, that leaves a whopping 60 to 80% of us who do, so it is best to get an allergy test before trialing a challenge with goat milk, particularly where severe allergies are a concern.there are some other factors in goat milk that make it easier to digest for some people (see go dairy free: the guide and cookbook for details), but if you are quite lactose intolerant, chugging back glasses of goat milk probably wouldn’t be a nice thing to do to your stomach.the closer a milk is in composition to human milk, the lower the probability of being allergic.everyone is different though, so i asked alisa if she could help explain the differences and similarities of various mammal milks and why they may or may not be “safe” for those with dairy allergies/intolerances.someone who is lactose intolerant may even be intolerant to the lactose in human milk.of course, it's not made any easier when you don't have a "true" dairy allergy (especially if you don't notice any overt symptoms like me).if you are testing dairy-free living via an elimination diet, you may be doing yourself a huge injustice if you consume goat milk during the cow milk elimination.right from the get-go let’s clear the air…in general all mammal milks (sheep, goat, camel, etc.) and their related products (cheese, sour cream, etc.) are classified as dairy.a friend and i who try to stay dairy free always commiserate with each other after eating another friend's homemade goat cheese.
