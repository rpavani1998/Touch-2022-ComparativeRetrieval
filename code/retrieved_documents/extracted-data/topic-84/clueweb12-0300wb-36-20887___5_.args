milk yields can differ more than ten times between breeds and within breeds, and lactation lengths can vary by 100%, which is a considerable potential for genetic selection and improvement.their medical and nutritional values have been the subject of at least 102 publications during the past 10 years demonstrating real benefits in malabsorption syndroms, chyluria, steatorrhea, hyperlipoproteinemia, and in cases of intestinal resection, coronary by-pass, premature-infant feeding, childhood epilepsy, cystic fibrosis and gallstones, because of their unique metabolic ability to provide energy instead of contributing to adipose tissues as other lipids do.promotion of sheep milk and its products could be much better organised and a greater market share realised, not just a special niche for connoisseurs, but also for medical needs, if producers, at least in developed countries, would make a regular percentage check-off money of their product sales available for a central agency for advertisements and research.of particular interest to dairy sheep farmers is the possibility of using sheep milk as an alternative to cow milk in cases of cow milk allergy.this can lead to sheep dairying alongside the cow milk industry as a unique and justified niche industry in many countries with considerable growth potential, that has been estimated in england alone to be worth more than us $100 million.medical research, however, has not adequately pursued the many practical experiences and anecdotal reports of benefits to patients suffering from cow milk allergy.on the other hand, milk is presently a better avenue to make a living in many parts of the sheep world (table 2), since wool has a poor market return, and sheep meat, mutton and lambs is in a tight profit position except for ethnic markets.on the other hand, milk is presently a better avenue to make a living in many parts of the sheep world (table 2), since wool has a poor market return, and sheep meat, mutton and lambs is in a tight profit position except for ethnic markets.they do show, however, the superiority of sheep milk composition, in relative terms compared to the composition of human, cow and goat milk ( tables 12, 13, 14); and in such critical nutrients as protein, calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin b6, vitamin b12, vitamin d, medium chain fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, linolenic acid, and all 10 essential amino acids.they do show, however, the superiority of sheep milk composition, in relative terms compared to the composition of human, cow and goat milk ( tables 12, 13, 14); and in such critical nutrients as protein, calcium, iron, magnesium, zinc, thiamin, riboflavin, vitamin b6, vitamin b12, vitamin d, medium chain fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, linolenic acid, and all 10 essential amino acids.low-fat sheep milk apparently has not been tried in marketing, but because of its high protein content and full taste, it should have potential.the unique richness in short chain and medium chain fatty acids in sheep milk, sheep cheeses, sheep butter (so far very neglected commercially), and their special values in human health and as treatment for many disease conditions is discussed extensively.in this effort, much is needed to improve the genetic ability of many dairy sheep populations to have longer lactations and to focus on much better udder morphology.however, the large population size of sheep breeds, their wide adaptability to climates and forages make sheep much more widely accepted and genetically of greater potential.the unique content of about 25% mct in total sheep milk fat and its possible quantitative modification through feeding has not been exploited commercially nor explored in research.
