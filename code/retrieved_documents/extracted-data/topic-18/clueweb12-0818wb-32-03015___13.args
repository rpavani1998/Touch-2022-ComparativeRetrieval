this cheapo blade has a thin flexible dangerously sharp blade, a wicked sharp tip, and it's only about $16.
put the drip pan on the bottom of the cooking chamber under the cooking grate.
the ideal setup is to place the bird on a rack 2 to 3" above the pan so heat and smoke can travel between them.
this is no ordinary turkey preparation, pilgrims.
then pick the boiled meat off the carcass and add it to the other leftover meat.
flip the carcass over so the backbone is facing up.
i have a nice messermeister meridian elite 5 knife set but, don't tell my professional chef friends, the knife i reach for most is my cheap rapala soft-grip 7.5".
melt 1 stick of butter (4 ounces) over a low heat.
digital thermometers are inexpensive, fast, and accurate.
the good news is that you don't need a smoker, although having one helps.
but ice crystals will still have formed.
1) once the guests are gone (or the next day if you're beat), wash your hands well, and begin pulling all the remaining meat off the carcass.
then the meat won't overcook while waiting for the stuffing to heat up.
the plunger that pops up is anchored in metal that melts at 185°f.
you don't want a beer can type arrangement or anything with solid sides because the metal blocks airflow to the cavity and impedes smoke and heat.
to make matters worse, some grocers allow turkeys to thaw a bit so theyfeel fresh.
that's the deep center and the last part to thaw, so removing them will help insure that the interior is melted.
the bird was excellent, only thing we goofed on was not having a big enough platter!
if you do add wood, you can toss it right on the coals.
starches are large molecules and they can't penetrate the tiny pores in the meat.
it doesn't matter if you have table salt, kosher salt, or sea salt.
had a bit of a scare when the bird was done a full 90 minutes early, but dialed back the grill, and in spite of coming off at 175 deg, the meat was still very tender and juicy!
the first time you try this recipe i beg you to go easy on the smoke wood.
if you have a good cooler, it should stay safe for up to 3 hours.
as instructed, i let the bird get up to 160 at the thickest part of the breast (multi-probe digital thermometer...one probe for the grill temp, one for the meat) and then pulled it out, set it in my cooler and let it work its way up to 165 and stay there for awhile stewing in its juices while i prepared the "gravy," which was freaking amazing.
the prizes will be awarded solely on the merits of the photo and the judge is a man with a masters in fine arts and who has in the past made his living as a professional photographer.
you may decide after tasting it that you want more on your next cook, but don't ruin the first one with too much smoke.
the herb rub added a lot to the flavor as well (just sage and thyme).
the authors are human and capable of mistakes, omissions, or errors, so we make no guarantees as to the accuracy, completeness, or safety of the information.
and doing so has the added bonus of letting the crotch area brown.
the bags should be tight so that when the ice melts it doesn't dilute the brine.
the method we use to mix the brine doesn't care what type of salt you use becuse we are going by weight not volume.
sometimes you can buy truly fresh turkeys with no ice crystals and no purge from a farmer or specialty butcher who has chilled them to between 32°f and 38°.
now catch this: if a bird has had salt and water injected, the law still allows it to be labeled "natural" because salt and water are natural ingredients!
if you can't get your bird above the pan, you should start it breast side down and turn it over after an hour.
move the bird around and get the air bubble out of the cavity.
put it into a deep pot, cover with water, and toss in 2 chopped carrots, 2 chopped onions (skins and all), a few celery leaves, a bay leaf, and some herbs.
it doesn't have much more of this essential amino acid than other meats.
you can serve the drumstick whole for the cavemen like me, or you can stand it on the meaty end and slice downward, removing the meat.
they will cook faster and be more tender and juicy.
i've never cooked a turkey on a grill, so i supposed i violated one of your [tenets] above by doing it for the first time for the big day, but apart from a few other minor deviations i stuck to the plan and it came out moist and tasty.

when it is dull i hone it and when it no longer holds a razor edge, i chuck it and get a new one.
turkey poses several problems that we can solve by thinking scientifically.
benchmarks °f °c dark meat has about 9% fat, 33% more than white meat, so it tastes and feels best at about 175°f.
2) cut off the wing tips and toss them in the drip pan, too.
do this 1) after the bird has thawed, open the bag it came in and pour the juices into the pan in which it was sitting.
at that point it is pretty hard (remember, freezing temp of water is 32°f), but not rock solid because of the proteins and other compounds in the liquids, not to mention the injected salt, prevent it from freezing completely.
the trick is to get the center to the target temp without overcooking the exterior.
they will pay for themselves in one steak dinner or one trip to the doctor.
most turkeys are grown by "independent" farmers who work under contract to big brand marketers like butterball and perdue.
the broad breasted white used by butterball, perdue, smithfield, jennie-o, and most other major brands has been bred smaller to fit modern family sizes, with larger breasts to satisfy the demand for white meat, with a metabolism that lets them grow to market size rapidly, and with all white feathers because dark feathers make black spots on the skin.
because processors are allowed to inject up to 8% of the weight of the bird, this also adds to their profit.
even though the oven was 325°f, the liquid never reached boiling temp in the time it took to cook a turkey.
but most of us don't have expensive calibrated sous-vide water bath cookers, and even then, if you aren't careful, there is risk.
then roll your wrist so it is halfway between 45° and the steel, about 22.5°.
oxidized white wine is fine; in fact i think it adds depth.
tucker submitted two shots, this facy fella ready to go out on the town dressed in spats, and another sitting on the beat up old weber genesis that has clearly served him well.
pour the slurry into a very clean container large enough to hold the meat and 2 gallons of water.
the old fashioned method has you cuttingwith the grain, and slices cut with the grain is always chewier than slices cutacross the grain.
they put cut up turkey parts in plastic bags, vacuum seal them, and place them in water baths at 150 to 160°f for 2 to 3 hours and the results are incredibly tender, tasty, and safe.
he is besides, though a little vain & silly, a bird of courage, and would not hesitate to attack a grenadier of the british guards who should presume to invade his farm yard with a red coat on.
the skin will still be brown because the maillard reaction can still take place at lower temps, but at a much slower pace.
by the time the heat penetrates that far, the breast will be overcooked and void of moisture.
go ahead and parade the whole bird around the room and take a few bows, but do the carving in the kitchen, not on the dining table.
this gravy/drip pan should have at least 3.5 quart capacity and must be large enough to fit under the entire bird.
as instructed, i let the bird get up to 160 at the thickest part of the breast (multi-probe digital thermometer...one probe for the grill temp, one for the meat) and then pulled it out, set it in my cooler and let it work its way up to 165 and stay there for awhile stewing in its juices while i prepared the "gravy," which was freaking amazing.

usda inspectors allow up to 2°f tolerance when testing birds in commerce, so a "fresh" turkey can be held as low as 24°f.
and most cookbooks tell you to tie them up if they didn't come that way.
you can substitute a small handful of celery leaves for the celery stalk.
the problem is that, when an animal dies the muscles can't get the blood laden oxygen they expect so they get stiff.
that's the deep center and the last part to thaw, so removing them will help insure that the interior is melted.
another technique is to cook low and slow.
thanksgiving 2011 was most profound for me.
2) slowly pour 1 cup [56 ml] of the smoked gravy into the roux, whisking it over medium heat as you pour, and keep whisking until it thickens and all lumps are gone.
these "slow-twitch" muscles fire slowly and fatigue slowly, so they need more oxygen for fuel.
you will need a cutting board with gutters to catch the ample juices, and a serving platter or 2.
turkey is unforgiving and your guests are unforgetting.
i would rather have a bird that was flash frozen right after slaughter than a so-called "fresh" bird that has been chilled to 26°f and is really only partially frozen, or a truly fresh bird chilled to 34°f that has been sitting around in the fridge for a couple of weeks.
simmer just below the boiling point for at least 2 to 6 hours.

they account for 99% of all turkeys on the market.
there is plenty of heat in the meat that it will not go cold in 15 minutes or longer.
for this recipe, we replace the water in the pan with the fixins for our special gravy and it will collect dripping further enriching the gravy.
