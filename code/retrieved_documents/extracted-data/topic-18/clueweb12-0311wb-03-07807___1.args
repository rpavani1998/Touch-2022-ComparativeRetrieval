the person who buys this grill probably didn't do their research and most likely
while relatively small this charcoal grill gives you enough room for many grilling tasks, but is limited in indirect grilling space.
so i am working to get a credit from home depot to get something else.
the btu output is low for the size (the char-griller version has 40,800 btus), but the barrel shape and thicker steel body holds in heat well enough to give you some good grilling power.
this brinkmann model as home depot is such a blatant knockoff of the char-griller duo sold at lowe's that you would think it would be too embarrassing to put out on the showroom floor.
since the competition between home depot and lowe's is so tight it would appear that they have to carry the same products, for the same price, but from different companies.
on the charcoal side you get a typical barrel shaped charcoal grill.
the cast iron cooking grates are good for heat transfer and the dual layer bottom holds in the heat and protects the painted finish.
first the girll was not put together properly by home depot, then there is a part on the lid that breaks.
one 402 square inch charcoal cooking chamber one 402 square inch 3-burner, 36,000 btu maximum output gas cooking chamber 1176 square inches of total grilling space 10,000 btu brass capped side burner under a flush mounted lid turn and click piezoelectric ignition on control knob stainless steel tubular gas burners porcelain coated cast iron cooking grates barrel shaped thermal painted steel body and lid hood mounted thermometers on each cooking chamber made in china by brinkmann exclusively for home depot stores.
basically this version is two grills, one gas and one charcoal mounted together on a single cart.
the gas grill side is a 36,00 btu 3-burner gas grill with medium weight porcelain coated cast iron cooking grates and a low powered, 10,000 btu side burner.
after all if the gas components of this grill rust out and make that side useless you have a 5 foot long charcoal grill with limited cooking area.

while some of these components are not the best quality they are not necessarily that bad for the price.

other than this, it is a typical low cost gas grill.
obviously home depot felt they were missing something so they got brinkmann to make this grill to the almost exact specifications.

the truth is that this grill isn't that well built.
