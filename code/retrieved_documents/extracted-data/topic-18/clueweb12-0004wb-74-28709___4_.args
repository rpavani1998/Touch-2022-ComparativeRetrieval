charcoal grills burn charcoal, produce smoke, and if they have a lid and a good design, can hold low temperatures for long periods of time.because of the high airflow in most gas grills, they are not good at capturing smoke and can cause foods to dry out over long periods of time.the smoke provides flavor, color, and aids in the breakdown of connective tissues (collagen) and fats.a good smoker does all this efficiently and provides the space necessary to produce the amount of barbecue needed.gas grills are designed to pump heat through the cooking chamber.many purists will say that the lower the temperature the better the barbecue, but in recent years, many barbecue competitors have moved to higher temperatures, partly because the technology of modern smokers makes this possible.charcoal grills, on the other hand, can make good smokers.this low and slow cooking process allows the tough connective tissues in these meats to breakdown, turning to sugar and water.at the same time, fats are slowly melted, providing moisture that prevents the meat from drying out.most charcoal grills are too small to produce a lot of barbecue, so if you want to smoke more than two racks of ribs or a pork roast, then you will need something larger, or in other words; a smoker.the trick tosmoking on a charcoal grill is to have a grill large enough to place the meat away from the direct heat of the charcoal fire.since barbecue is cooked at such low temperatures, the cooking times are very long.this means that a 10 pound beef brisket can easily take 10 hours to smoke.gas grills do not make good smokers.this is done either by cooking indirectly or by using some kind of baffle (more on this later).
