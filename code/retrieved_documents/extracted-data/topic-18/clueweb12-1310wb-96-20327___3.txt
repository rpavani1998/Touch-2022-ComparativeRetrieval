achieving a juicer cut of steak is done by letting the meat set for a short period which will allow the juices that have moved to the middle of the meat redistribute throughout the meat evenly which keeps much of the juices from running out when it is cut.

anyway, the connection of the points is just a subjective opinion, but i do have a lot of verified information to back up the fact that there is a lot of water vapor in gas grilling and the effects and methods of searing to achieve the maillard effect are well known and do in fact require dry heat to achieve properly according to all the expert opinions ive read.

i wasn’t trying to link gas grilling  to braising or stewing, i was trying to show that wet heat cooking was reserved  for tougher meats that are generally braised or stewed.
i dont understand what you mean, i was talking about dry heat as the best method for acheiving the maillard effect, thats all.
i think those wiki articles are looking too deep into the different methods of cooking.
look up the maillard effect  in wiki, i couldn’t add all the links that support the conclusion i came  too.

studies have shown that much of the "charcoal" flavor obtained from grilling is due to the vaporization of meat juices dripping onto hot coals/lava rocks/flavorizer bars.
the contrast between the crispy  flavorful exterior and the tender juicy soft interior is what makes a great  steak truly special and different.
in fact it is still hard to achieve  properly on a charcoal grill with widely spaced grates as only a portion of the  surface of the steak is in contact with the hot metal of the grill.
personally i can tell a pronounced difference and more complex flavor and texture when the maillard reaction has been properly achieved.
i think most restaurants use a  salamander to cook steaks.
it’s  my understanding that this is the reason most top chef’s use a  sauté pan on the oven top to sear their steaks as they have full contact  to the meat surface plus the fond is used for a sauce after deglazing which is  far more effective then any flavorizing bars or meat juice vapor. .
any moisture that is developed from the burning of lp is  irrelevant to grilling, imho.
it also helps a great deal to bring a steak to room temp before grilling.

as for the smoke flavor i dont think it is all that pertinent since it is well known that smoking wood chips can be done on both types of grills and smoke flavor should overpower and obscure any hardwood lump charcoal flavoring which is also a smoke flavor.

a charcoal grill will give  you dry heat as well but the difficulties of heat control and the extra time of  waiting on the coals to reach optimum temperature is more of a pain then most  busy kitchens can afford.

either that or you must get out the chemistry set and test the flavornoids before and after to see if the simple acids and molecules have broken down and formed new ones.

you  are correct about the importance of resting the cooked meat.
so i had to edit all of  them out, and there were several good ones.

so technically if you want the best prime cooked steak it will either be done on a stovetop and finished in the oven or on a charcoal grill with someone who really knows what their doing and how to sear properly.

the fact that many cant tell the difference between gas and charcoal and why some serious outdoor cooks claim a better flavor with charcoal may be because of the following: my guess as to why many cant tell the difference has nothing to do with the charcoal flavor but has to do with the maillard reaction and subsequent caramelization that is far easier to achieve with dry heat cooking.

i simply made the stretch (not much of one) that the wet heat from gas grilling would make it harder to achieve.

if you can't get good carmelization (maillard) on a gas grill, you need to change your approach or replace the unit you're cooking on.
in addition, searing does not seal in the juices, that is a myth, in fact it  does the opposite.

btw, wide grate spacing makes it very difficult.

also from what i  understand it’s not just a little moister that comes from gas grilling,  it’s a lot, almost 60% water vapor which steams the meat and makes it very  difficult to achieve the maillard effect.

maybe you have never acheived this on any grill and have no reference unless you compare it to a steak done on a stove top and finished in the oven.
lp gas creates a large amount of water vapor when it ignites and creates what is known as wet heat which is said to be a poor choice for cooking lean tender cuts of steak and should only be used for roasts and tougher cuts of meat that are often braised or stewed because of the amounts of collagen that needs to be broken down.

this is probably why no top chef at any  respectable restaurant will use a gas grill, most will pan sear and finish off  in an oven, both of which are “dry” heat.

most havent learned to properly sear a steak to begin with nor do they even know how and why to do it, so many of these tests are probably invalid if the test cooks dont know any better.

most importantly the flavor difference between the two.
the resulting smoke flavors the meat.
