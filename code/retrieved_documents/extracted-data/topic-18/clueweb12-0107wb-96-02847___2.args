yes / no by kirk the griller from cordillera, co on 07/08/2009 did not fit as well as told the cover is well designed just needed to be bigger as a very tight fit which makes it hard to take on and off for grilling.

the bottom is so high that rain bounces off the patio and gets into the bottom compartment via the vents.
this 3" wide, 2' long vent lets in rain, dust, dirt, crud, and everything else floating through the air.
weber grills are very dependable and last for years.
i didn't want to return - because it was a easy fix for me.

product proved durable enough to stay in place, unscathed in a 70 mile per hour gust of wind!!
just like the $100.00 grill i bought 15 years ago from ace.
one side of the cover was not stitched properly.
cover is top vented to allow for evaporation & circulation.
mainly protects against dust and dirt.
weber, the company that touts itself as the premier grill company cannot even make a decent grill cover.
also this cover has a vent running along the middle of the cooking compartment.
