gas barbecues produce less smoke and soot than charcoal, wood or coal fired barbecues but there are environmental issues with regard the production and transport of the gas.disposable barbecues are easy to use, highly portable and cheap, but they are only for single use and you have very little control over the cooking temperature.both gas barbecues and charcoal bbqs are environmentally friendly but with a charcoal barbecue, it is important to burn smokeless fuels.charcoal barbecues work in much the same way as fires do; air is drawn up through the coal which helps to breathe life into the flames.gas barbecue grills are easy to light and you can control the heat easily.this will ensure the food is cooked thoroughly and evenly.closing the lid when cooking on a barbecue will keep the heat in and keep the barbecue at a constant temperature.you can cook any food on a charcoal barbecue that you would cook on a gas barbeque and some people prefer the smokier taste that a charcoal barbecue produces.charcoal barbecues create a 'smoky' taste, it is easier to manage the temperature of the coals but you do have to wait for the coals to heat up until they are ready to cook on.a gas barbecue can also be extinguished immediately by turning off the gas supply and stopping the flow of gas to the burners.they are ready to cook on sooner than charcoal barbecues, and they are cleaner as they do not produce as much soot and smoke.charcoal barbecues burn charcoal to generate their heat.the best way to clean a charcoal barbeque is to brush the grilling surface down with a wire brush whilst it is still quite hot.the burners on a gas barbecue are also evenly spaced giving an all over, even heat.combine this with a non-abrasive detergent or soap and rinse with water until the grill is free from food debris and grease.
