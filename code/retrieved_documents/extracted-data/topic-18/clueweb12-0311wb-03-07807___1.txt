bought it on impulse.
i purchased one exactly 4-months ago.
this model has been discontinued.
manufacturer's site user reviews 1 out of 5 falls apart, member jsdanow1
the questions you should be asking yourself is do you really need both a  charcoal and a gas grill and if you do would it make more sense to buy one of  each separately.
while relatively small this  charcoal grill gives you enough room for many grilling tasks, but is limited in  indirect grilling space.
so i am working to get a credit from home depot to get something else.

the btu output is low for the size (the  char-griller version has 40,800 btus), but the barrel shape and thicker steel  body holds in heat well enough to give you some good grilling power.

recently there have been a few side by side grills.
this brinkmann model as home depot is such a blatant knockoff of the char-griller duo sold at lowe's that you would think it would be too embarrassing to put out on the showroom floor.
since the competition between home depot and lowe's is so tight it would appear that they have to carry the same products, for the same price, but from different companies.
on the charcoal side you get a typical barrel shaped charcoal grill.
the cast iron cooking grates are good for heat transfer and the dual layer bottom holds in the heat and protects the painted finish.
over the years several companies have attempted to blend the convenience of gas with the flavor of charcoal.

first the girll was not put together  properly by home depot, then there is a part on the lid that breaks.

the real question is, do you really need this 5 foot long, 120 pound all in one grill or would you be better served with separate grills.
basically this version is two grills, one gas and one charcoal mounted together on a single cart.

propane tank and cover sold separately guide review - brinkmann dual zone charcoal gas grill
the gas grill side is a 36,00 btu 3-burner gas grill with medium weight porcelain coated cast iron cooking grates and a low powered, 10,000 btu side burner.
after all if the gas components of this grill rust out and make that side useless you have a 5 foot long charcoal grill with limited cooking area.

while some of these components are not the best quality they are not  necessarily that bad for the price.
sound too good to be true?

other than this, it is a typical low cost gas grill.

my recommendation would be to purchase aweber charcoal grill for  around $100 that will last you a good decade and perhaps a lower endchar-broil  gas grill for around $150 that will last a few years.

brinkmann dual zone charcoal gas grill model# 810-3821-s. this gas/charcoal dual grill is almost an exact copy of the char-griller duo  that sells at lowe's home improvement stores.
obviously home depot felt they were missing something so they got brinkmann to make this grill to the almost exact specifications.
the gas grill side is a 36,00 btu 3-burner gas grill with medium weight  porcelain coated cast iron cooking grates and a low powered, 10,000 btu side  burner.
the btu output is low for the size (the char-griller version has 40,800 btus), but the barrel shape and thicker steel body holds in heat well enough to give you some good grilling power.
the brinkmann corporation the bottom line
add in a side burner, albeit a weak one and you have what would appear to be a complete package, and all for about $300usd.

the lids do not seal and the gas does not come out evenly.
