it acts as a heat sink, absorbing energy and moderating fluctuations.a water pan also puts humidity in the atmosphere to reduce evaporative cooling and helps keep the meat moist.they are highly competitive because they know that we shop for bargains so they use efficient, inexpensive, mass production farming methods.the advantage of a vertical roaster is that you get much better airflow up into the cavity than when the bird is reclining and that means better smoke penetration from the inside as well as more even and faster cooking.it is an "essential nutrient" which means it is necessary for good health and you must ingest it because your body doesn't make it.only by using a food thermometer can one accurately determine that a meat has reached a safe temperature.excessive salt consumption can be hazardous, but not moderate consumption.by holding the thighs and drums tight to the body, it prevents them from cooking properly and keeps the skin in the bird's crotch from darkening and crisping.when overcooked, as it often is, the dry meat is neutral and unexciting.you can add herbs and spices such as garlic and pepper, but they can overwhelm the meat's natural flavor.this will help the skin crisp during cooking because it breaks down the structure of the skin and dries it out.this gravy is a thin, flavorful broth that penetrates the meat, making it incredibly moist and tasty.even "free range", "pasture raised", "natural", and "organic" birds are easily contaminated because they scratch and peck in dirt and grass that is teeming with bacteria, and because they eat insects, worms, larvae, seeds, etc.grill manufacturers compete to undercut each other's prices so they are not about to install a high end thermometer, especially when most of their grills are used for hot dogs and burgers.it takes time because the meat is a combination of water, fat, and protein, and they are good insulators.
