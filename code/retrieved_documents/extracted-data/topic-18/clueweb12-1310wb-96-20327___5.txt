i wasn’t trying to link gas grilling  to braising or stewing, i was trying to show that wet heat cooking was reserved  for tougher meats that are generally braised or stewed.
in addition, searing does not seal in the juices, that is a myth, in fact it  does the opposite.

what to do with leftover dark...
a charcoal grill will give you dry heat as well but the difficulties of heat control and the extra time of waiting on the coals to reach optimum temperature is more of a pain then most busy kitchens can afford.
either that or you must get out the chemistry set and test the flavornoids before and after to see if the simple acids and molecules have broken down and formed new ones.
stewing and braising involve meat's being partially or fully submerged in a liquid.
i think those wiki articles are looking too deep into the different  methods of cooking.
but it has as much to do with taste as flavor, temperature, smell and looks do.
studies  have shown that much of the "charcoal" flavor obtained from grilling  is due to the vaporization of meat juices dripping onto hot coals/lava  rocks/flavorizer bars.
i think most restaurants use a  salamander to cook steaks.

if you can't get good carmelization (maillard) on a gas grill, you need to change your approach or replace the unit you're cooking on.
rice pudding - the inconsistencies »
i think most restaurants use a salamander to cook steaks.
because of this i am guessing that the maillard reaction is difficult at best to obtain with wet heat from a gas grill using direct open flame where the water vapor is directly exposed to the cooking surface (wiki quote) propane burns to form water and carbon dioxide
this is probably why no top chef at any  respectable restaurant will use a gas grill, most will pan sear and finish off  in an oven, both of which are “dry” heat.

sorry i couldnt site the links that support my research, but the forum rules wont let me
from u.s. domestics to european saloons.
its my understanding that this is the reason most top chefs use a sauté pan on the oven top to sear their steaks as they have full contact to the meat surface plus the fond is used for a sauce after deglazing which is far more effective then any flavorizing bars or meat juice vapor.
the resulting smoke flavors the meat.
this effect would  be available on gas and charcoal grills but not in a skillet or outdoor gas  griddle.

any moisture that is developed from the burning of lp is  irrelevant to grilling, imho.
the contrast between the crispy flavorful exterior and the tender juicy soft interior is what makes a great steak truly special and different.

it’s  my understanding that this is the reason most top chef’s use a  sauté pan on the oven top to sear their steaks as they have full contact  to the meat surface plus the fond is used for a sauce after deglazing which is  far more effective then any flavorizing bars or meat juice vapor. .
people dont put enough stock into texture or maybe many are not that sensitive to texture
in addition, searing does not seal in the juices, that is a myth, in fact it does the opposite.

the only 4 star restaurant near me (the mansion at turtle creek dallas) uses of all things, a hasty bake charcoal oven for their award winning steaks and their one of only a few top high rated restaurant that bother with charcoal at all.
also from what i  understand it’s not just a little moister that comes from gas grilling,  it’s a lot, almost 60% water vapor which steams the meat and makes it very  difficult to achieve the maillard effect.

i simply made the stretch (not much of one) that the wet heat from gas  grilling would make it harder to achieve.
so technically if you want the best  prime cooked steak it will either be done on a stovetop and finished in the  oven or on a charcoal grill with someone who really knows what their doing and  how to sear properly.
achieving a juicer cut of steak is done by letting the meat set for a short  period which will allow the juices that have moved to the middle of the meat  redistribute throughout the meat evenly which keeps much of the juices from  running out when it is cut.
the fact that many can’t tell the difference between gas and charcoal and  why some serious outdoor cooks claim a better flavor with charcoal may be  because of the following: my guess as to why many can’t tell the  difference has nothing to do with the charcoal flavor but has to do with the  maillard reaction  and subsequent caramelization that is far easier to achieve  with dry heat cooking.

wet heat vs dry heat after much research and wiki articles i was able to find some evidence as to the possible reason why many seem to prefer a charcoal grill over a gas grill.

personally i  can tell a pronounced difference and more complex flavor and texture when the  maillard reaction has been properly achieved.
i dont understand what you mean, i was talking about dry heat as the best method for acheiving the maillard effect, thats all.
i have  cooked on both gas and charcoal grills and can obtain the appropriate browning  and degree of doneness on both.

as for the smoke flavor i dont think it is all that pertinent since it is well known that smoking wood chips can be done on both types of grills and smoke flavor should overpower and obscure any hardwood lump charcoal flavoring which is also a smoke flavor.
this in no way compares to a higher humidity level in a gas grill vs a charcoal grill.

most havent learned to properly sear a steak to begin with nor do they even know how and why to do it, so many of these tests are probably invalid if the test cooks dont know any better.

you  are correct about the importance of resting the cooked meat.

searing only tastes better because of the maillard reaction.

in fact it is still hard to achieve properly on a charcoal grill with widely spaced grates as only a portion of the surface of the steak is in contact with the hot metal of the grill.
i wasnt trying to link gas grilling to braising or stewing, i was trying to show that wet heat cooking was reserved for tougher meats that are generally braised or stewed.

lp gas creates a large amount  of water vapor when it ignites and creates what is known as “wet  heat” which is said to be a poor choice for cooking lean tender cuts of  steak and should only be used for roasts and tougher cuts of meat that are  often braised or stewed because of the amounts of collagen that needs to be  broken down.
btw, wide grate spacing makes it very difficult.

they are not the same thing.
this results in a beautiful sear from the stovetop and a gentle finish in the oven that yields a juicy interior.
