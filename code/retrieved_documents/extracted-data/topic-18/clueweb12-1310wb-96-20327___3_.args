lp gas creates a large amount of water vapor when it ignites and creates what is known as “wet heat” which is said to be a poor choice for cooking lean tender cuts of steak and should only be used for roasts and tougher cuts of meat that are often braised or stewed because of the amounts of collagen that needs to be broken down.lp gas creates a large amount of water vapor when it ignites and creates what is known as wet heat which is said to be a poor choice for cooking lean tender cuts of steak and should only be used for roasts and tougher cuts of meat that are often braised or stewed because of the amounts of collagen that needs to be broken down.a charcoal grill will give you dry heat as well but the difficulties of heat control and the extra time of waiting on the coals to reach optimum temperature is more of a pain then most busy kitchens can afford.studies have shown that much of the "charcoal" flavor obtained from grilling is due to the vaporization of meat juices dripping onto hot coals/lava rocks/flavorizer bars.anyway, the connection of the points is just a subjective opinion, but i do have a lot of verified information to back up the fact that there is a lot of water vapor in gas grilling and the effects and methods of searing to achieve the maillard effect are well known and do in fact require dry heat to achieve properly according to all the expert opinions i’ve read.the fact that many can’t tell the difference between gas and charcoal and why some serious outdoor cooks claim a better flavor with charcoal may be because of the following: my guess as to why many can’t tell the difference has nothing to do with the charcoal flavor but has to do with the maillard reaction and subsequent caramelization that is far easier to achieve with dry heat cooking.the fact that many cant tell the difference between gas and charcoal and why some serious outdoor cooks claim a better flavor with charcoal may be because of the following: my guess as to why many cant tell the difference has nothing to do with the charcoal flavor but has to do with the maillard reaction and subsequent caramelization that is far easier to achieve with dry heat cooking.so technically if you want the best prime cooked steak it will either be done on a stovetop and finished in the oven or on a charcoal grill with someone who really knows what their doing and how to sear properly.anyway, the connection of the points is just a subjective opinion, but i do have a lot of verified information to back up the fact that there is a lot of water vapor in gas grilling and the effects and methods of searing to achieve the maillard effect are well known and do in fact require dry heat to achieve properly according to all the expert opinions ive read.most haven’t learned to properly sear a steak to begin with nor do they even know how and why to do it, so many of these tests are probably invalid if the test cooks don’t know any better.achieving a juicer cut of steak is done by letting the meat set for a short period which will allow the juices that have moved to the middle of the meat redistribute throughout the meat evenly which keeps much of the juices from running out when it is cut.most havent learned to properly sear a steak to begin with nor do they even know how and why to do it, so many of these tests are probably invalid if the test cooks dont know any better.the contrast between the crispy flavorful exterior and the tender juicy soft interior is what makes a great steak truly special and different.this is probably why no top chef at any respectable restaurant will use a gas grill, most will pan sear and finish off in an oven, both of which are dry heat.this is probably why no top chef at any respectable restaurant will use a gas grill, most will pan sear and finish off in an oven, both of which are “dry” heat.
