this little powerhouse has been a god send, in addition to being ready to use, it adds great charcoal flavor provides adequate grill space for most any application, it's quick firing and easy to clean.the charcoal heated quickly and provided the proper heat for grilling.its high quality cast iron and offers a good amount of grill space.however, it uses less fuel (real charcoal is best because it leaves less ash), starts quickly because the heat is contained, and its high heat is ideal for a perfect rare steak or seared hors d'oevres.this cajun cookware grill weighs 40 pounds and is great for camping.it heats evenly, cleans easily, and takes up hardly any space.the high heat also means cooking must be constantly monitored - not a problem at table top.it is solidly built which is a plus for table-top cooking and does not come with a cover because it is not appropriate for slow cooking.we use this small hibachi for heating saki or tea water out doors in our tea house, or for taking the chill off on a cool evening when we want to enjoy the stars, the small size is prefect for us.no true hibachi has a lid but it would be nice to expand cooking versatility, for slower cooking.the hibach grill must be used on a table top and is therefore messier than a stand-alone grill.the cajun cookware grill is pre-seasoned cast iron and round in shape.a big kettle grill is fine when you have a big party, but if you're just having a few friends over or grilling for a small family, this is the way to go.because it's made of cast iron it's heavy (40 lbs), so while it's portable, it's not going to knock over.shipping dimensions & weight: shipping width: 16 inches shipping height: 16 inches we have the best customer service (read our customer service testimonials)
