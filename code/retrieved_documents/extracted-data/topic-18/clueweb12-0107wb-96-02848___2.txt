compared to other weber grill covers i have had in the past, i was surprised that this one isn't as heavy & thick as described, but it protects the grill like it is supposed to and
cover is top vented to allow for evaporation & circulation.
i know others have complained about the location of the vents being on the sides of the cover instead of the front and back as other weber covers are designed, but a cover needs to allow air to circulate.
