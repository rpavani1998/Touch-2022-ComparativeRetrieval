if you spend the extra money of the offset firebox you can use this unit as a smoker as well.

member pndxtr1 after spending hundreds on this ""dual"" monstrosity, and spending 2 hours assembling it, i find that it is missing a part of the igniter.
this grill is being dumped on the market by lowes and others for $225, not the $399 or $499 msrp.
if this works for you then this is a grill to consider at since it sells at some locations for around $300usd (try lowes home improvement stores) it won't put you out that much.
the attached side burner is powerful enough to heat a good sized pot though the mounting is a little weak so you can't put a lot of weight on it.
the gas grill side is a nearly 40,800 btu 3-burner gas grill with medium weight porcelain coated cast iron cooking grates.

the cast iron cooking grates are good for heat transfer and the dual layer bottom holds in the heat and protects the painted finish.
on the charcoal side you get a typical barrel shaped charcoal grill.
