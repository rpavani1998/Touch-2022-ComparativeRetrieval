construction: gas grills come in many different sizes and shapes.
the reason is  that to cook barbecue, one needs to use charcoal/wood coals cooking over long  periods of time (6 to 12 or more hours) in dry heat.
so make sure the favourites are within reach at all times.

and they simply stand there turning the meat as it cooks and letting both sides experience the flame.
the best idea we have seen are thick full deflecting shields which cover the entire flame (not just a portion which can find the flame) and are thick enough to radiate some good even heat.
this allows the meat to be grilled on each side the exact amount of time you desire and will keep the meat from being cooked too fast with temperatures that are too hot.
except with the possibility  of delicate meats such as fish, we recommend keeping the lid open.
pork and lamb chops should be close to room temperature or a little cooler before cooking.
