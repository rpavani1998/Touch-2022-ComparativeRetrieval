by lisa (staten island, ny) hi, i just bought my husband a charcoal smoker for his birthday; we,re all about grilling and deepfrying turkey and want to spread our wings.i smoke for weddings and graduations.if your like me and are on the run all the time, the electric smoker fits my needs.the gas smoker holds an even temp and woprks great!!!don't usually have to watch temps that much.
