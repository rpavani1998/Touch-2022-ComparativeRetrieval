by lisa (staten island, ny) hi, i just bought my husband a charcoal smoker for his birthday; we,re all about grilling and deepfrying turkey and want to spread our wings.
harold depends on  how much time you have.

the gas smoker holds an even temp and  woprks great!!!
as beginners should we have started off with propane?
i smoke for weddings and graduations.
