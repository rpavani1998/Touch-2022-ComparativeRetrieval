char-griller duo gas/charcoal grill model #5050 char-griller the bottom line char-griller has been making charcoal grills and  smokers for a few years.
this grill is being dumped on the market by lowes  and others for $225, not the $399 or $499 msrp.
i probably won't purchase one of their items again, after this frustrating customer service experience.
pros - inexpensive gas/charcoal combo - can be used as a smoker if you buy the optional side smoker box cons - lower quality gas grill components - lightweight construction description - one 438 square inch charcoal cooking chamber - one 438 square inch 3-burner, 40,800 btu maximum output gas cooking chamber - 1260 square inches of total grilling space - 12,000 btu brass capped side burner under a flush mounted lid - aa battery electronic igniters - porcelain coated cast iron cooking grates - barrel shaped thermal painted steel body and lid - hood mounted thermometers on each cooking chamber - propane tank and cover sold separately - made in china by char-griller (a&j mfg) and sold through several retailers guide review - char-griller duo gas/charcoal grill model #5050
while some of these  components are not the best quality they are pretty good for the price.
beware of this company!
if  you are in the market for both gas and charcoal grilling (or you can't decide  which way to go) this is a unit to take a look at.
the question you have to ask yourself is, do you really want two grills bolted together?
while relatively  small this charcoal grill gives you enough room for many grilling tasks, but is  limited in indirect grilling space.
recently they introduced a small 3-burner gas grill.
if you add on the optional  offset firebox you can use this charcoal grill as a smoker.
user reviews 3 out of 5 bad customer service, member pndxtr1 after spending hundreds on this ""dual"" monstrosity, and spending 2 hours assembling it, i find that it is missing a part of the igniter.
this gives you a 3-burner gas grill and a similar sized charcoal grill mounted on a single frame with a 12,000 btu side burner on the side.
other reviews regarding rust, dripping, and other issues are reported on other reviews of this grill.
if you must  have this grill, shop around!

the char-griller duo is a combination of theirchar-griller grillin pro gas grill and a smaller version of their popular charcoal grills.
this grill is being dumped on the market by lowes and others for $225, not the $399 or $499 msrp.
numerous calls to their ""customer service"" dept.  and their corporate office yielded nothing more than uncaring people who found  a need to explain their idiotic procedure that requires a week to send out a  one-ounce part costing 50 cents.
the btu output is a little low for the size, but the barrel shape and thicker steel body holds in heat well enough to give you some good grilling power.

user reviews 3 out of 5 bad  customer service,
on the charcoal side you get a typical barrel shaped charcoal grill.
the cast iron cooking grates are good for heat transfer and the dual layer bottom holds in the heat and protects the painted finish.
of course with more parts you have more  to go wrong with it and since the gas grill side relies on some lightweight  components you might end up with a working charcoal grill attached to a failed  gas grill.

if you spend the extra money of the  offset firebox you can use this unit as a smoker as well.

the  attached side burner is powerful enough to heat a good sized pot though the  mounting is a little weak so you can't put a lot of weight on it.

while relatively small this charcoal grill gives you enough room for many grilling tasks, but is limited in indirect grilling space.
if this works for you then this is a grill to consider at since it sells at some locations for around $300usd (try lowes home improvement stores) it won't put you out that much.
other than this, it is a typical low cost gas grill.

typically selling for $300  to $400usd this isn't an expensive combination unit and with over 1200 square  inches of cooking space it is a very large grill, though you probably will only  use one side at a time.
a part of the new york times company.
other than  this, it is a typical low cost gas grill.
imagine it something really important was  missing!
the gas grill side is a nearly 40,800 btu 3-burner gas grill with medium weight porcelain coated cast iron cooking grates.
