it is very heavy and if you are placing it on a wooden deck i suggest something to put under it so that it doesn't dent the wood.

the main grate has a hinged door in the front for the same purpose.
the cooking grates are 3/8-inch welded 304 stainless rod and the remaining stainless steel pieces are cnc laser cut plate.

the lid would literally be too heavy to lift but the covered spring mechanism makes the lid virtually weightless.

manufacturer's site 5 out of 5 the best do-it-all cooker, member greg_r i've owned and used a komodo kamado (or kk) for the past 6 years for all kinds of food in every kind of weather imaginable.
you buy this grill because it is attractive, extremely well built, and because you can (i personally can't).
the kk is one of the few cookers that can cook slow-and-low (225 for bbq) and also achieve very high temperatures for breads and pizza (800+ degrees).
there is even a space to install the popular bbq guru airflow control mechanism that lets you control the temperature of this grill with computer precision.
this grill comes standard with three cooking grates, giving you up to nearly 1,000 square inches of potential cooking space.
the kk is a luxury item with the customization, fit & finish and the customer support to match.
kk is also great if you have small children around...
the main grate has a hinged door in the front for the same purpose.
the cookers have increased in price and features over the years but this cooker still represents a good value when you consider the looks and required space for potential replacements.
you get to choose the color of the tiles or stones along with the grout so it can match other objects in your backyard.
the cooker is extremely efficient, i have bbq'd up to 20hrs straight without ever having to refill the charcoal.

the insulation makes the surface slightly warm to the touch, even if you are running at very high temperatures.
this 23-inch version will run you nearly 5 times what a comparable egg would cost at around $3,600usd.
