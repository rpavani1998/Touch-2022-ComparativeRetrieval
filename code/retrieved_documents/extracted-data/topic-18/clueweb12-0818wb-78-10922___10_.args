when propane combusts it makes more steam than charcoal, and that may help keep meat moist giving gas an advantage for some meats.because most gas grills cannot achieve the same high heat as charcoal, charcoal is superior for getting that great dark crust on steaks that is much more flavorful than tan meat.they are easy to start, they heat up within 10 to 15 minutes, they hold temperatures steadily yet we can crank them up and cool them down in a hurry, they can be configured for indirect and multi-zone cooking, and they are easy to clean.charcoal makes more smoke than gas, although, when lit completely, when ashed over, good charcoal produces little smoke and besides, it is not likely to penetrate deeply into food that is cooked quickly such as hot dogs, burgers, or steaks.propane gas is ideal for grills because, when pressurized, it compresses and turns to liquid, making it easy to store in tanks.the combustion gases from charcoal when mixed with smoke from wood chips or chunks makes a distinctive flavor typical of traditional southern barbecue.since charcoal grills do not have temperature dials to raise or lower temp, it is important to learn how to set up a2-zone fire which helps you regulate heat by moving meat from the hot to the medium zone, and learn how to control the energy of the fire by closing off the oxygen intake vents.because the mechanisms are more complex, gas grills tend to be more expensive than comparable charcoal grills, assembly of new gas grills is more complex than charcoal grills, and there are more parts to break and be replaced.grillgrates can be added to most any gas grill and can significantly improve the cooking characteristics.the most important reason to buy a charcoal grill is that charcoal can get hotter thanstandard gas grills, and heat is what you need to get steaks and lamb crisp on the outside and red or pink on the inside.most gas grills cover the flame jets with metal plates, lava rock, or ceramic rocks that absorb the heat and radiate it.charcoal is dirty to handle; it can be hard to light; it takes about 15 minutes longer to get up to temp; there can be flare-ups that can burn the food andflareups may be a health risk; it is hard to tell what temp you are cooking at; the temperature cannot be turned down rapidly; during long cooks it slowly loses heat and you need to add more charcoal; charcoal grills rarely have rotisseries; and there is a lot of ash to clean up after.most gas grills use metal plates, lava rocks, and ceramics to radiate heat, so there are no open flames, no flareups, and cleanup is easier because drips are usually vaporized.infrared burners use a gas flame to superheat a ceramic or metal plate that radiates much more heat than standard burners.there is also a minor difference in the flavor imparted by combustion gases, the volatile by-products given off by the burning of the charcoal or the gas.
