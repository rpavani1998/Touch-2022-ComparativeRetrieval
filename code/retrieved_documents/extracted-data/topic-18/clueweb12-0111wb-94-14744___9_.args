propane is inexpensive, convenient, and safe as long as you take the right safety precautions.however, in today's modern homes, which come equipped with a central furnace for heat, their appeal is mostly aesthetic and nostalgic (for looks) rather than practical (for warming a large living area).the heat provided by these units can make autumn evenings out of doors much more cozy and enjoyable.just as the hearth can be a wonderfully enjoyable focal point in the winter months, the grill area can be the social highlight in the months of june, july, and august.by contrast, vent-free gas logs lower heating costs in two ways: they require about half the fuel, and they operate with the damper closed.but always the goal is to control the fire and to tame it to your purposes which is, most likely, to produce heat for warmth and perhaps cooking, and also to create an ambiance of cozy comfort.similarly, patio heaters are stand-alone units with dome tops that radiate heat well in all directions, taking the chill out of spring and fall evenings if you sit close enough to them.once again, these come in many different shapes, sizes, and price ranges, depending on how large an area you want to heat.remember, a typical backyard grill is constantly exposed to massive heat and extremes of weather.these logs can cost slightly more and produce smaller flames than vented units.so a little extra money goes a long way toward ensuring quality and durability.other models are called firepits and are simpler in design but still provide much enjoyment.traditional fireplaces the most familiar type of indoor fireplace is the typical "wall-mounted" model found in dens, living rooms, even bedrooms (though in some structures, such as large contemporary homes and ski lodges, it may be free-standing and centrally located in the room, with openings on two or more sides).some people like them just to look at and to fill up a blank space in a wall, but rarely use them because of the work involved in acquiring fuel and keeping them clean.needless to say, cooking outdoors is not only practical when the thermometer is pushing 90, it's also fun.
