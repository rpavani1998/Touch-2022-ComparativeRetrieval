i might add that there is no need to buy and use charcoal lighter fluid.
propane scares me to death.
we have both a weber charcoal grill and a commercial grade gas grill and a charcoal and an electric smoker, and i use them all.
roll them up adding more strips of paper until it's about half to three quarters of an inch thick, and tie with candle wick leaving an extra 2 inches of wick.
for the most part, however, i have two cookshack smokers, (superb); one platinum weber summit gas grill, and also run a charcoal smoker when i have the chance, in addition to two portable grills.
great grilling can be had over  either gas or charcoal flames.
it's really nice, but i dont ever use it.
dip in the wax 3-4 times for 5-10 seconds, making sure to get the extra wick too without getting your fingers in the wax.
since you can't dial down the heat of white-hot coals,  it's a good strategy to leave empty spaces on the lower grill grate (areas  without briquettes).
and something that runs on gas or electricity to cook it with.
charcoal is superior in my opinion.

i'm female grill fanatic & real charcoal's always my way 2go!
these cool spaces allow for better control, letting you sear food first over the hot spots before transferring it to cooler parts to finish cooking.
i learned that both in science class, with a particular classmate who likes making battery acid eat through foil, and on girl scout campouts with toast on a stick.
you can get charcoal irons, which turn red hot, and are designed for lighting the charcoal.
then i coat them with bbq sauce and cook them on high in the crock pot with nothing else until they are ready to almost fall off the bone.
the main thing is, use what you like, don't listen to nay sayers and enjoy cooking out of doors.

now we're in fl we love to gather downed orange trees and use chips on the grill.

also you don't have to endure that nasty lighter fluid smell !!!
a bag of charcoal can easily be chucked into the car and taken to the  park or beach.
find out how to do it right!
calvinrjones29 aug. 19, 2010 5:39 pm i grill whenever i get a chance and there is nothing like that coal smoke,and the food just tast better with coal instead of gas.
so it doesn't flare up.
i have done briskets , chicken and prime ribs like this and as long as you keep the foil packs working, they will in fact almost replace the flavor imparted by good lump charcoal.
charcoal/open flame purist, what can i say.
one day, while at his house, we decided to have hamburgers for lunch.
bigunn aug. 11, 2011 7:11 am i have both gas and charcoal.
the verdict ultimately, any determination of what's best comes down to  considerations of convenience, cost, flavor and practicality.
cost of the chimney is appox 12 bucks.
yes, it is easier but the clean up is better for me.

when we have people over or not going to games and have plenty of time to grill, charcoal is the way to go.
they all come out good but charcoal & wood has been far the best, quoted from different guest whom i have entertained.
i personaly use a gas grill and a wood only grill.
so now that we've settled that, what's the barbeque capital of the world?
cdub may 4, 2010 8:55 pm i have both.

i needed to control the temperature of heat better than just moving the pile to one half and placing the meat over the less intense side (i usually put the "pyramid" towards the hinge/back area leaving the front/handle area free of charcoal).
then i bought a large gass grill with a smoker tray on the side.
i decided to use one of my boards (again, not treated, i didn't wanna go poisoning anyone) to prop the lid open (it looked like a giant pac-man) to desired height by using the board as a wedge.
brotherthomas randyo aug. 10, 2011 11:56 am i am from the southwest and "grilling" has been a tradition for as long as i can remember..
catid3 may 23, 2011 4:36 pm i have grilled for many years and initially i would use briquette and lighter fluid, until i discover a charcoal chimney.
really quite superior to charcoal bricketts to me..
if you want true smoke flavor, use some wood chunks instead.

chrisanderin jun. 21, 2009 10:16 am i learned (by mistake/trial and error, whatever you want to call it) a great way to add flavor without putting wood in with the charcoal, yet still using it.
suffice to say this, anything that alters the flavor of that meat except a good char is not welcome.
cookie monster jun. 17, 2009 5:24 am charcoal seems to be best, love the smoky flavor but i know it has hazards such as the chemical in the lighting fluid will also ruin the bbq if not properly burned off papabob jun. 18, 2009 9:16 am use a chimaney to light the charcoal thers no fluid flavor throw a piece of dried hard wood or any fruit wood and you have extar layer of flavor just don't over do it play with your fire learn to cook indirectly and you have wonderful grilled juicy pork with a nice smokey flavor you can do all that with a gas grill also
i still use his grilling tricks today.
i have both and use both.
i assume it would be nice with other meats.
i light it up, hang out in the back yard with our daughter, its an event , its awesome.
i only use the gas if we get home late from baseball games and need to cook somthing quick.

something you can't do in your gas grill.

heart of the matter dec. 23, 2011 11:23 pm my late husband had the answer to nasty un healthy lighter fluid that he was adamantly against.
r e l a t e d kenneth jul. 18, 2009 9:29 am i have both a gas grill and a charcoal grill and when it come to one of my favorite thinks to do cooking on a grill i have to say that charcoal is the way to go.
but you don't have the lighter fluid taste.
i think that this is the best way to get a full smoked flavor it what ever you are cooking, and the lower cooking temp.
i barely ever use my gas grill.
i gutted an old gas grill and burn wood in it.
not starter fluid smell or taste.
charcoal is the only way to go.
no more smelly lighter fluid, no more lighter fluid tasting food.
i did the charcoal route and the taste is so much better.

i have a tel-tru on my gas grill that has proven to be accurate over years of use, so i know when it says 700 that's what it means.
is there a substitute?
again, you have a reliable and instantly changeable, regulated by you heat source, so your temps will stay very tight and your steaks (or whatever you cook)will be uniform, even from week to week.
before we talk about flavor and taste, let's talk about accuracy.
i suppose gas is easier but there's nothing like playing with fire.
but now have a gas grill.
playing with fire is fun.
8 hours later when you get up, open your grill to perfectly smoked, fall off the bone bbq.
the lint is extremely flammable and the wax keeps the starters from burning out too quickly.
they are not even in the same league.
on the other hand on winter time you do the cooking along and here in arkansas sometime is real cold and that when the gas grill is the champ.
you want great flavor go charcoal !!!!!
remove any outer covering on them.

pain in the butt to control the temps, but it's cheap
and i have gas and charcoal and i love both.
i had the choice to light the gas grill or take a few extra minutes and light some charcoal.
since you can't dial down the heat of white-hot coals, it's a good strategy to leave empty spaces on the lower grill grate (areas without briquettes).
(of course, this can be a plus or minus, depending on who's behind the flame.)
