the cookers have increased in price and features over the years but this cooker still represents a good value when you consider the looks and required space for potential replacements.this insulation also makes cooking in wind, snow or rain very easy...this grill comes standard with three cooking grates, giving you up to nearly 1,000 square inches of potential cooking space.these cookers range in quality from junk to decent with varying levels of customer support so buyer beware.weighing in at nearly 600 pounds of which 82 pounds are stainless steel, this is the space age of charcoal grills.the insulation makes the surface slightly warm to the touch, even if you are running at very high temperatures.the bottom grate fits down inside the grill and has an open space in the front to feed the fire.these would be primarily used for smoking, giving you plenty of space for lots of barbecue.you get to choose the color of the tiles or stones along with the grout so it can match other objects in your backyard.you buy this grill because it is attractive, extremely well built, and because you can (i personally can't).the kk is one of the few cookers that can cook slow-and-low (225 for bbq) and also achieve very high temperatures for breads and pizza (800+ degrees).the lid would literally be too heavy to lift but the covered spring mechanism makes the lid virtually weightless.of course there is very little comparable between the two, other than the fact that they are both kamado style grills.the cooker is extremely efficient, i have bbq'd up to 20hrs straight without ever having to refill the charcoal.there is even a space to install the popular bbq guru airflow control mechanism that lets you control the temperature of this grill with computer precision.
