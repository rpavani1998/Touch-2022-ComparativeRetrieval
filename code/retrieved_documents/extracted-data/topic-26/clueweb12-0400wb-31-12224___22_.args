the four-door coupe style is awesome, and i think they make great alternatives to the traditional sedan/saloon.the whole “four door coupe” thing is an oxymoron, and the engineers and designers put too much work into the cars and made them too stylish to be force-fit into an oxymoronic name.the sedans, especially the 2-door ones, were considered rather low in prestige; the hardtops cost more and were seen as much cooler, tho yes, the windows would soon rattle or leak and hardtops were structurally awful in a roll-over.they’re not to my taste (if i wanted a car that large, i’d want something more practical), but it’s nice that they’re a part of the marketplace.it makes for the most solid structure and while great strides have been made, the fact is frameless windowed doors will rattle before framed ones.the headlights on it look a little odd but it was just the overall shape and the emotion, strong, sleek, yet romantic and feminine.if i’m going to drive a car large enough to warrant a usable back seat then i want 4 real doors and maximum practicality.they’re stylish, yes, so people who care about style should buy one.as far as an alternative to 4 dorr coupe, which is retarded, sportback is not a bad alternative, not great, but better than 4 door coupe.if a manufacturer is too lazy and too ignorant to come up with an accurate and appropriate name they don’t deserve my business.they’re what i look forward to buying someday with the excuse to my wife that it’s still has four doors, so we could fit some kids in there if we need to.i loved it so much, if i were a billionaire, i would go after that car just to put it in my garage, even if i could never drive it.it’s probably the most iconic sedan shape ever and there’s a reason that shape is so iconic.if you trade every 3 or 4 years or aren’t going to put a lot of miles on a car,it’s not much of a consideration, if you drive the wheels of vehicles then you’ll want to keep it in mind !i wish we would dig up some great name from the early days of the car that means the same thing, or re-tool something, like how some automakers are tempting the idea of bringing back the idea of a shooting brake here in the u.s. just give me a new name to call them, that sounds simple and reasonable, and i’ll be cool.
