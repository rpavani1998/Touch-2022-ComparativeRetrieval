very disappointing road test.
i agree that it makes little sense for bmw uk to supply cars in such specs for testing, but for some years now they have been obsessed with stupidly big, heavy wheels with stupidly slender tyre sidewalls, usually in full blown sport spec, and with the runflats making things worse* i suppose that's what happens when the marketing folk take over from the engineers.
nov 18, 2009 8:55 am contrary to the knockers this will be a success.
from personal experience earlier in the year, it was impossible to find an existing six cylinder five or three diesel on standard se spec on standard se wheels.
sadly, the ultimate driving machine looks like remaining the uncomfortable jarring machine.
j as is the case with many bmw's nowadays think long and hard about speccing those big alloys ( doubtless with runflats) as they may well ruin the ride.

i'm not so sure about the point of the hatch cum boot either as surely a hatch would be lighter and more practical .
it is also the cars that the uk operation is choosing to bring in to move on into the nearly-new market - i.e. all those "direct bmw" pre registered cars with a few thousand miles' use on as demo cars or which bmw uk marketing people have drivern for a couple of months as company cars.
would choose an equivalent bmw after test driving both.
lupe, don't blame autocar - they can only road-test the vehicle that bmw uk is prepared to provide for testing.
making the perfect car (e39) only happens once in a blue moon, the only way is down after that.

*incidentally it's not just the press fleet that is so afflicted.
this is a real shame about the gt because we were told it was bmw getting out of the stupid 'sporty' fad and back into what they did best - go for a ride in any e39 on standard rims to understand what that means.
£40k for a 7-series sized motor that can do a smidge over 6 secs for 0-60mph and return 40mpg.

they were all sports or, in the case of the few se fives available, were on "optional" bigger wheels.
just like with so many other car co's its just a matter of short years before bmw is taken up by toyota, honda, vw, mb or nissan/renault.
although they are trying as best they can, they simply cannot copy nor compete with vw/audi/porsche and it isn't even close.

bmw is in free fall.
the front somehow reminds me of buck-toothed mater, the old tow truck in "cars" now i should be called 44 cars so far ... and 21 motorbikes !

they must believe that most people buy their cars on the basis of looks alone, and perhaps they are right, which if true would be depressing.
okay, so (a) there's the bmw badge, whose appeal to green-eyed types is immediate and undeniable, and (b) the jag looks and feels like an old fart's car, but the way it turns down the volume on every bump and imperfection to the point that they're barely noticeable, all the while leaving the car feeling fully connected to the surface without any hint of float, is pretty bloody astonishing.

spec the standard 18" wheels with higher profile tyres.
