positioned as the sportiest luxury sedan, it was quickly seen as a welcome alternative to former bmw customers alienated by that brand’s polarizing styling and idrive system.a hatchback sedan based on the a5 coupe, it will be a niche vehicle and play up audi's emphasis on design.styling and r&d are working in harmony, and our feeling is that if audi can continue to produce the types of vehicles we’ve seen recently, bmw and mercedes will have a lot to worry about—and soon.significantly longer than the a5 sportback and more independent in style, it will be positioned between the a6 and the a8.another possibility is a version powered by a conventional combustion engine that could achieve well over 110 mpg in the european cycle.unlike its somewhat plump competitor, the upcoming bmw 5-series gran turismo, the a5 sportback looks sleek, with low, sporty lines.audi wants to play up the design theme, and the aluminum-structured a8 will be another large step forward for the brand, particularly inside the cabin.in our talks with audi engineers and designers, their mood is noticeably upbeat despite the current economic crisis.according to one audi insider, the main reason for delaying the a8 is the economy; it’s not a good time to be launching ultraluxury cars that you expect to sell in high volumes.it flopped because it was expensive and because it wasn’t particularly sporty; for most of its life, the top two engines made a measly 75 hp.audi added more powerful engines late in the a2’s life, but they weren’t enough to spur success and the car was axed.with the next model, audi wants to catch up in the u.s. and the rest of the world, too.launching the new a8 away from an auto show will make sure the new car isn't buried among a flurry of international unveilings.the conversion looks so good that you might think the r8 was styled with a topless version in mind from the beginning, which wasn’t the case, according to chief exterior designer stefan sielaff.far bigger news for 2010 is the a1, a compact, three-door hatchback that shares many components with the new volkswagen polo.
