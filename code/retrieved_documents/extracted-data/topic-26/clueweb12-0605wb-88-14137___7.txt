the 113bhp 116i petrol model has just enough punch, but was greatly improved in 2007, when power was increased to 120bhp and is the petrol engine to go for.

other reported problems include petrol engine ecus failing, windows seizing shut, airbag faults - generating a warning light on the dashboard - and an issue with the electronic stability control, causing it to shut down.
the entry-level model comes with four electric windows and a cd player, but no alloy wheels or air-con.

"there are significantly more diesel models on the used  market, but don't automatically dismiss the smaller petrol engines.
what are the running costs?
the 113bhp 116i petrol model has just enough punch, but  was greatly improved in 2007, when power was increased to 120bhp and is the  petrol engine to go for.
the pinnacle of the range is the 261bhp six-cylinder 130i.
so far, the 1 series has been the subject of just a handful of recalls: one concerning a rear axle problem, an issue with the power-assisted brakes and a possible fault with the front side airbags and seat belt tensioners.
the 120d averages 49.5mpg to 58.9mpg and 128g/km to 153g/km  of co2.
this coincided with a mild face-lift and  the introduction of more powerful, yet economical engines, and bmw's efficient  dynamics technology.
there are also some reports of faulty manual gearboxes and  clutches, making it difficult or impossible to select a gear.
