by phil berg on sale: fall 2010 expected pricing: $75,000-$85,000 the audi a8 has been casting a growing shadow behind bmw, mercedes-benz and lexus, and this fourth generation of audi's flagship luxury car features high-tech equipment not yet available in the bigger, more powerful, more popular mercedes s-class.
the a8 will offer a system audi calls autonomous partial braking, which uses a forward-facing camera to detect shapes of pedestrians, other vehicles, and rapidly approaching objects.
audi dynamic steering will vary the steering ratio, making the car easy to  maneuver at slow speeds, and change to firm and responsive at high speeds.
the system combines what it sees ahead with information from other sensors, including speed, weather, driver inputs, and vehicle dynamics.
on sale: fall 2010 expected pricing: $75,000-$85,000 an all-new audi a8 goes on sale late in 2010 as a 2011  model.

that means there is no conventional low/high beam switch, the car searches for and illuminates all dark areas without blinding oncoming traffic.
however, the audi v8 is expected to return 18 mpg in the city and a respectable 25 mpg on the highway.
that's a  significant 3 mpg better than the bmw and 4 mpg better than the mercedes.

audi says the a8's all-aluminum unit-body, introduced in 1997, accounts for 1.2 mpg of that advantage.
the all-aluminum 2011 audi a8 will boast a sumptuous interior and  the latest in driving dynamics and active safety technology.
unless you have four brake pedals and four  right feet, you can't brake this good.
this information is used to control the shape of the headlight beam to fill in the dark parts of the road.

the 2011 a8 promises a leap ahead in refinement, efficiency, comfort,  and style.
unless you have four brake pedals and four right feet, you can't brake this good.
that's a significant 3 mpg better than the bmw and 4 mpg better than the mercedes.
that's sufficiently quick for most drivers, though less than what's  available from bmw and mercedes v8s.
the 2011 a8 will come with a 4.2-liter aluminum v8 engine making 372  horsepower, which audi promises will launch the car to 60 mph in well
but  it is also coupled to the electronic stability control system of the a8, and if  the car should slide or drift unexpectedly on a difficult road surface, it will  actually apply counter steering to the front wheels to keep the a8 in control  of the driver.
the 2011 a8 will come with a 4.2-liter aluminum v8 engine making 372 horsepower, which audi promises will launch the car to 60 mph in well under six seconds.
that  means there is no conventional low/high beam switch, the car searches for and  illuminates all dark areas without blinding oncoming traffic.
although there will be one v8 and two v6 diesel engines  available in europe, audi will offer only the gasoline v8 in the u.s. 800-for-audi new search   |  free price quote home | car reviews | pricing |  comparisons | awards & advice | finance & insurance | about us |  license our reviews | privacy copyright © 1994-2012 new car  test drive, inc.
high-tech headlights developed in-house by audi are composed of 66 white  leds that use sensors to determine if the car is going straight, up or down a  hill, or whether there's oncoming traffic.
but it is also coupled to the electronic stability control system of the a8, and if the car should slide or drift unexpectedly on a difficult road surface, it will actually apply counter steering to the front wheels to keep the a8 in control of the driver.
all of that information makes the car react by braking each wheel optimally and automatically.

a new infrared-based thermal imaging pedestrian detection and warning system intended to be used in dark and inclement weather conditions when vision is a problem can detect pedestrians ahead and alert the driver, using a warning tone, a jolt of the brakes, and a visual display on a seven-inch led information screen in front of the driver.
