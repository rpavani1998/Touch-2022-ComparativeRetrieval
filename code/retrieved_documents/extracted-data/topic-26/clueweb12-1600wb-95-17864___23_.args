the 2.0-litre tdi engines, with between 118bhp and 168bhp, are the best option - not only for availability, but for running costs and residual values, too.the four-wheel-drive 261bhp 3.2-litre is more of a car for keen drivers, but rare on the used market.predictably the diesel a4s are cheapest to run, with stronger residual values and much better fuel economy than the petrols.servicing costs are on a par with those of rivals, but audi dealers tend to have some of the highest labour rates.visibility is good, and the driver's seat is easily adjustable to suit most people.entry-level specification is good with stability control, electric windows all round, climate control and remote central locking, while se adds alloy wheels, parking sensors, and upgraded stereo and cabin trim, and multi-zone climate control.the 2.0-litre diesels average between 55.4 and 47.9mpg, with the 2.7-litre at 44.1mpg and the 3.0-litre managing 42.8mpg.they share many of the engines and gearboxes, so should be able to carry out any work.the handling is balanced and there's good grip through bends.audi has a good reputation for building classy wagons, and the a4 avant lives up to that.heavily kerbed alloys could mean the steering alignment is out, and tyres will wear faster than expected.the a4 is no longer the class leader in terms of fit and finish, but the cabin is still build with high quality, solid feeling-materials.the ride is on the firm side, if not quite as severe as that of the bmw 3 series - although the a4 avant struggles on poor surfaces.there are some complaints about notchy or noisy gearboxes, but this doesn't appear to affect their performance.it is a desirable car, too against the estate car is poor over bumps and is potentially pricey.
