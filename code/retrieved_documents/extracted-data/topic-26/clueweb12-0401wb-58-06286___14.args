revive the mark coupe using the mustang platform with multilink rear suspension and 7 or 8 speed auto or 6 speed manny for the lsc version, this should be v8 only.
step three introuduce a small city car in the 140 -175 inch range.
it may not sound nice to say it, but part of a upmarket brand is buying into an image or snobby factor if you will.
i put my mks up against any luxury vehicle (sold around the same price range) in america any day.
lincoln needs to go the route of hyundai and offer bang-for-your-buck.
if it doesn’t pop into one’s head when heard, that is a real problem, especially for people that follow the auto industry as most posters here likely do.
minus, you don’t understand vehicle buyers preferences (what they will and won’t buy, for you my child, to understand…): * coupés and convertibles tend not to sell well, even in luxury brands, and they have to be brought with caution; a two-seater next-gen mustang-based coupé-convertible (let the 4-seater for the mustang), replacement to the last gen t-bird might do some lincoln sales (and it’d be basd on a then-existing platform to justify [$$] it).
also bring back the ford gt perhaps in lincoln form because that would look hot!!!
i’m referring to ford having a small to mid-size domestic pickup, period.
i’m a ready buyer and suspect there would be many 1000′s of others!
step two bring back the continental name plate and make the mark series a big s class fighting sedan and a four door convertible flag ship.
you don’t drive a lincoln mkz because you want a chromed out fusion….you drive a lincoln because you can.
these are very respected nameplates and very solid cars.
if they want to kick-start the lincoln brand into relevance then it is going to take resources initially.
in 2010, lincoln sales were 3.6 percent higher than in 2009.
lincoln should tap into ford of australia’s rwd platforms for a new continental to replace the mks.
this car would be v8, have all the most uptodate technology and exude refinement, reliability and be rear wheel drive also (or 4 wheel drive).
noone is old at heart, not even people who are 90 so don’t design a brand to appeal to the higher end buyers parents design it to appeal to them and there very much alive sence of mystique, excitement and cutting edge/next step vibe.
i like ford, and i’ve been very impressed with the company for the past couple of years.
in peoples minds, you make a pickup and you are appealing to the working guy/gal.
also would give lincoln very unique vehicles in the ford portfolio, make the dealers happy and give consumers a real reason to return to lincoln dealers.
what they need to do is make them look differnt front to back just like they do, also put names back on the cars.
that division needs to get their heads in the game and really design their cars (inside and out) around the people purchasing in that category, or dump the line all together.
the only thing people would be interested is if it had awd, especially for those living in the north.
i’m 38 years old and have owned and currently drive the lincoln town car.
the funny thing is, most of the consumer population doesn’t car about rwd, nor do they realize when they are driving one (case in point: i know mt did an article on bmw about the 1 series and being thought of as a fwd).
going down to a new continental supreme luxury sedan and then creating a cts fiighter as well.
legendary, celebrated names.
come on lincoln, you guys should be smarter than that.
i would produce an old-fashioned, rwd sedan that can fit 5 adults comfortably.
they are folks that work for global market companies, invest internationally, and reside in homes/condos, etc.
ford falcon would be perfect.
it sounds like they know this and that is their plan already so i just wish them luck in pulling it off.
first off make sure at the redesign all models do not look like a ford in any way.
rwd plus longitudinal engines means excessive weight.
just look at cadillac…though i think their designs are bordering on garish, they’ve made an unbelievable splash in the lux car segment.
with lots of international influence.
also, put names on the cars, not letters.
the larger platform could be used for a town car replacement.
ford vows to stop neglect of lincoln scion partners with ibiquity to offer hd radio ford to bring more diesel tech into future crop of ecoboost engines mulally dishes on lincoln’s future, promises ford-like turnaround 50 comments ford, mazda and volvo shared platform of their cars, but each brands able to keep its differentiation.
bring the maverick back, as a smaller version of the mustang, and bring back at least one 2-door suv or introduce a 2-door cuv.
i would make a performance series with v-8′s, rwd, and awd yes to differentiate the look from ford, they will now have the grill work of the 70s era oldsmobile cutlass.
i don’t think they can just survive or compete, they need to dominate or they will die.
lincoln needs some major work ford.
the field is too crowded for any other option.
and as a topper they could actually call it the mark x like the concept shown in 2003 that was a great looking car but was never produced.
smaller platorm for small fuel efficient sporty car going up to mustang size.
it should be luxurious, and part of being a legitimate luxury brand means having a halo vehicle and a coupe of some kind.
ford will also need lincoln to become more “youthful” in terms of brand culture.
that means rwd, and available v-8 for the top tier vehicles.
i would stay away from the ancient i-6 they use and use the ecoboost v6 and turbo a downsized (4.4 or so) version of the coyote 5.0.
ford having a new pickup is a totally different thing of course, makes a lot more sense.
also a smaller vehicle to compete with jeep would be nice, just make a raptor without the box, that would be small enough with some 40 inch tires and we’d have a jeep killer!!!
this will get buy in from the service people and make them proud of the brand.
as an avid ford man i just don’t get it.
many of these vehicles could be sent to austrailia and used to make smaller rwd cars in austrailia as well.
in 2010, lincoln sales were 3.6 percent higher than in 2009.
[g+] on january 13 2011 10:00 am ford took the detroit auto show as an opportunity to remind us of plans to dramatically differentiate thelincoln brand from ford vehicles in both design andtechnology offerings.
“the strategy isn’t just new products, but full differentiation from the ford brand in not only design, but intechnology,” said derrick kuzak, ford’s group vice president of global product development, to automotive news and others at the detroit auto show.
with rwd and v-8′s they are just leather lined mustangs and crown vics.
details such as an adjustable suspension system, different engines (a specially-tuned ecoboost v-6, perhaps), and upgraded all-wheel drive could help establish lincoln as definitively upscale in comparison with ford.
i can honestly say if lincoln actually styles a different looking car than a ford rather than just grafting on a new nose and tail, i might actually consider one.
zephyr, navigator, town car, cosmopolitan(51), premier(57)etc. agree 100% with getting rid of the letter monikers.
ford also kept the latest technology for the jaguar and aston back then.
i find it funny on how everyone seems to be intent on rwd.
“the strategy isn’t just new products, but full differentiation from the ford brand in not only design, but intechnology,” said derrick kuzak, ford’s group vice president of global product development, to automotive news and others at the detroit auto show.
chrome wheels and grilles can’t cure ugly, and in my opinion, they make a plain design look even cheaper, not more upscale.
they need to stop with the cheap looking cliche things (like when they were trying with the retro interiors…yuck!), and pay more attention to styling (aka, huge steering wheels containing a giant airbag foot print shared with ford brands have to go, should not even be in fords!).
i agree, get rid of the alphabet soup and name the car.
they could also bring back the continental as the flagship to replace the town car, and a new lux-coupe.
if official bmw need pay attention to official ford motor will might make discontinue to mustang and f-series.
elwood engle and others convinced him “one more” chance and produced the fabulous 1961 lincoln continental which basically put them back on the map and made lincoln a force to be recognized in the automotive world.

if i were ford i would engineer two all new worldwide rwd platforms that are adjustable to create small sporty cars and small rwd sedans to a town car/ crown vic replacement.
lincoln needs to make awd and 4 and 6 cylinder ecoboost engines its calling card.
with this many cars in that many markets the cost of the platform would be less and would be paid off faster then is just for one market and one car.
on the vehicle front, make some plug-in hybrid and ev variants to sell with decent profit margins to cover developement expenses.
a return to continental “trade marks” of rear fender skirts and fancy rear access spare tire would be a clear design identification of it’s linage.
if they can’t build enthusiasm with the dealers… this is crap.
upgrade the navigator’s powertrain.
they could get away with introducing one because of the iconic american view of pickups once they are at the top of the heap, say if they were looked at in the same light as bmw (or whatever brand you consider one of the leaders of the segment), but not anytime in the near future.
dashes of sportiness but never at the expense of seeming immature or beneath their station.
they also need a modern up to date v8.
are you kidding, they are expecting their dealerships to invest (comparatively) huge sums of money on a promise.
long, low, in both glasstop and convertible 4 door models, take the gorgeous 1939 continental and bring it up to date.
home » wot » future lincolns to receive upgraded technology and design to distinguish from ford written by: zach gale
with standard awd and ecoboost engines they will be competing with audi instead of acura.
the buyers with money want “new and high tech”.
with mercury gone, ford may have more money (and attention) to devote to lincoln.
if they design the cars for 60-80 year olds that is the only market they will get, and that market is one that is dying quick.
maybe because it was before we were inundated with luxury brands from overseas.
the current big lincoln (mks isit?) is not a bad looking car but needs its butt out of the air and it should have a more road worthy stance.
a nip here and a tuck there these cars could be best sellers in their segment.
and should receive new tech first, not ford (and maybe have of its own special tech, like premium radio systems).
but lincoln needs to consider that in order to get back to those roots, they need to offer a vehicle that offers something no other import brand does.
i like the mkz appearance as it is, although by all means freshen it.
they dont need a rwd look at acura and audi they do just fine.
names make a lux brand look cheap in the eyes of current high end purchasers.
there’s another thread here on mt’s forums (from a better source) that rumored that two different-size ecoboosted (t-gdi or 2t-gdi for the uniciated) engines might roll first: a 2.2l i4 (most likely for the production version of the mk-c focus-based sedán, a larger version engine of the 2.0l other f products will get) and a 2.7l v6 (brand-new size in this era, f doesn’t offer in noam any 6 below 3.0l).
it also wouldn’t hurt to have a calling card, a bit like audi’s quattro, making all their models awd – though it doesn’t have to be that in particular.
they should lincolnize the mustang as well and sell it as the mark ix.
* give the green light to build the production version of the mk-r (might get another name) mid-size rwd sedán (next-gen mustang-based, also to spawn the next-gen oz falcon and needed for the coupé-convertible i mentioned above).
lincoln has tried light pickups before (blackwood, mk-lt) and failed (only could find takers in mx), so no lincoln version of raptor.
but still would be very cool.
lincoln can improve its product line just like all the other hundreds of car companies you are competing with these days
so far lincoln has really only done that with a higher price point but that is not enough.
the brand, at the very least, models not part of the ford lineup.
right there and then i think what they’ve laid out is basically a good starting point but lincoln desparately needs some sporty sedans.
whatever it is, they are going to have to do something drastic to get the image of tarted up fords out of peoples minds – i can think of no other brand that has their mass market and ‘premium’ brand cars so closely mimicking each other.
if you’re under the age of 65 and haven’t lost your marbles, you’ll go with the cts.
just as cadillac defined an “art and science” style with the cts, ford will need to do the same.
make it quiet and more refined than the mustang, load it up with technogoodies and have it compete with the mb sl class at a lower price point.
in many ways, i think the ford counterparts of lincoln vehicles actually look better and more upscale.
automax, the only one left who knows how to save the auto industry!!!
all the lux brands have a sporty offerings, except lincoln ( mks ecoboost doesnt look sporty at all )
give it more power (ecoboost v6, and ecoboost i-4) with the base line 4 giving about 250 horsepower and extremely good fuel economy at us turnpike speeds.
that vehicle needs to be exclusive in the eyes of the lucky ones that purchase it.
down the line a fullsize competitor to the 7 series and s class.
if popular are worried about if ford need saving ford mustang , ford f-series and australian ford falcon future.
they need to really look at competitors and the market.
if lincoln expects to compete with any of its so called peers such as caddy and merc etc, then who -is responsible for the brand needs to get their head ootb and observe the competition.
really would like to see lincoln restored as the premier elegant vehicle manufacturer in the usa market.
even more extreme styling changes (especially the interior).
only the rednecks and super old want retro (see camaro / mustang…and now i’m not saying all camaro / mustang drivers are rednecks…but they are the ones boosting sales high enough to justify).
i think it would do lincoln a world of wonder to release a 2 door rwd coupe based on the mustang with a 4 wheel independant suspension and aluminum chassis parts to seperate it from the mustang.
give it adjustable suspension, with better handling (the goal should be audi or bmw levels), and go absolutely nuts to make it quiet.
i hear the whole “american” them…but again…folks in that price catagory don’t care.
lincoln first of all needs a flag ship with rear wheel and all wheel drive.
aside from the name there is not much to set the lincoln far ahead of the ford.
as one who sells lincoln vehicles i can say from personal experience that lincoln customers want something that sets them apart from ford customers.
although the platform is dated, it’s somewhat modern.
they need to be more detailed oriented and remember the market they are courting and the amount of money they are asking buyers to spend.
* lincoln and both sports car and muscle car don’t mix, so don’t make them be anything that they aren’t (a defined image is so important for any car brand, more so for luxo-brands).
as someone already said on here if lincoln wants to be truly successful and set itself far ahead it has to look to be a competitor to the likes of audi and bmw in quality and engineering and not be afraid to take some pages from those companies play books!
make a ford large sporty sedan used to be then new p.i.
design and quality sells cars.
they look like hell and don’t have anything but decent interiors to back up the “luxury” claim.
with mercury gone, ford may have more money (and attention) to devote to lincoln.
i actually think it would be cool for ford to even have a flagship that is a kind of ‘global’ model in the style department more than actual platform.
ford vows to stop neglect of lincoln scion partners with ibiquity to offer hd radio ford to bring more diesel tech into future crop of ecoboost engines mulally dishes on lincoln’s future, promises ford-like turnaround 2011 chrysler 200 convertible alternatives to big family cars five most expensive repairs
i just want a continental with awd (closest i’ll get to rwd) and the suicide doors.
electronic gizmos don’t sell cars.
because you have attained that level of financial comfort, that you want to go out and do something nice for yourself and award yourself for all your hard work.
use the for a miata type car for na and europe, 3 series fighter for lincoln, a new mark viii sport coupe with serious sporting pretentions.
i like the fact that i can use regular gas and have better techology then cars that cost double the price of my mks.
i wouldn’t think it would be possible to come up with a platform architecture that could support a small sporty sedan and a midsizer as well as the next mustang.
now borrow a little swagger from apple stores and make lincoln showrooms a jewel and not a smoke smelling, built in the 1960′s, used to be a mercury dealership experience.
the two brands should never see each other products, sharing platforms is going to happen obviously but get them to produce their own models from the ground up if they are their own ‘premium’ brand.
v6 is ok for the lower food chain lincolns but not the top dog.
acura, lexus, audi, bmw, mb, jag, caddy, all use letters rather then names.
vw always put technology ahead in audi before putting it vw models…why not ford do such game plan i think for american buyers this would be a great option, look at the line up, add a more luxurious paint coat option, emblem treatment, special edition model like a olympic edition, bring back the presidential edition, maybe a sports enthusiast edition something like a billiard se with a pool cue and carrying case green felt stiching or something less bland.
as for acura, they’ve already gobbled up the marketshare, of consumers seeking near luxury regardless of drive wheels.
i think folks with all that surrounding them would like to see the same in their vehicle.
details such as an adjustable suspension system, different engines (a specially-tuned ecoboost v-6, perhaps), and upgraded all-wheel drive could help establish lincoln as definitively upscale in comparison with ford.
to revitalize the lincoln brand ford with first need to “define a style” and build momentum at the major autoshows.
it seems like most don’t care if its front wheel drive or rwd but they do seem to care if its awd.
you could spread this platform worldwide, sending a new crown victoria to not only here but china as well.
lincoln would have to directly compete with acura.
i honestly think that if ford killed of lincoln, no one would really care.
front wheel drive for the most part is a turn off to me.
a lincoln should emit confidence and class and be unmistakable.
i hope all of you that are making these comments about lincoln at least drove one or better yet even sat in one.
next name your models, don’t blend in with the other brands with this mkz, cts q27i, toaster oven model number boredom.
im sure if they did that and gave it an “lincoln” eco boast v6 with one of those 6 speed trannies not only would it stur life back into the long forgoten “hot rod linclon” idea but get more people into linclon show rooms.
that is the last thing a ‘premium’ car maker needs, does mb have one, bmw, infiniti, no – and for good reason.
make the customer feel like they are in the presence of a great automobile culture.
if popular will be very mad at ford.will change green vehicles like cheap .
a rwd larger sedán (can be smaller than a town car, but not much) is needed to mantain a beach-head in certain industries (limo/taxi/hearse…), as long as it has the latest large car engine, suspension and tranny technology.
if lincoln is going anywhere it’s going to have to be through differentiation, and if they produce that hatchback thing i’ve been seeing in concept photos then i’ll puke.
strained finances or not its going to take at least a couple rwd/awd sporty sedans to make lincoln relevant.
another pr stunt that crain’s “reporters” slipped worse that with that gooey stuff (the one that a full-size van couldn’t go through it…) that appeared on a “modern marvels” doc-show, sheesh!
automax says make rear wheel drive or buy big crane and knock down lincoln dealers as they are a waste of space with no rear wheel drive models.
fomoco needs a new pickup in the mid-size/compact range.
