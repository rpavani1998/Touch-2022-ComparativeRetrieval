the a4 is cheaper to own than to rivals, taking depreciation into account, and should prove as reliable.the 2.0-litre diesels are popular with fleet buyers because of their economy and low group 12 insurance rating.this is dangerous, and could cause permanent engine damage.audi has been known to contribute to the cost of repairing some cars out of warranty, so you shouldn't expect to pay for fixing cars that are less than three years old.with precise handling and good roadholding, the audi is entertaining to drive, and unsettled by only the bumpiest surfaces.the more powerful versions of the a4 come with four-wheel drive, which noticeably improves traction but lowers fuel economy.an early version of audi's multi-media interface (mmi) is a desirable option, and like bmw's idrive, lets you control the radio, cd player, ventilation system and sat nav.this a4 retains audi's tradition for clarity, quality and comfort inside the cabin.controls are logically laid out and feel durable, and four people can sit in comfort.the 4.2-litre models may have the performance of junior supercars, but running costs will reflect this, with an insurance group rating of 20, a special servicing schedule and only 20mpg.large diesels comprise 2.5-litre, 2.7-litre and a 3.0-litre v6s diesel models have better residual values, but if you want a petrol car the turbo-charged 2.0-litre fsi engine is a sensible choice.the 3.2-litre petrol-engined version is rare and not that exciting, as opposed to the 4.2-litre which produces up to 414bhp, and rivals bmw's m3.main dealers have a reputation for higher prices, but stick to independent specialists and you can cut up to 35% off your service bills.the central locking can fail, and dealers aren't always able to fix it quickly.the 2.0-litre diesel models can burn oil over time and some owners don't check the level, relying instead on the oil warning light.
