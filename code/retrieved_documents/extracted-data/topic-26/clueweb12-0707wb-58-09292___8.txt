i just got back from the dealership and it is worst..
we finally had to drive it to the dealer with the front down and leave it on to  prove what was happening.
also anyone please let me know if there is change in 2012 audi q7 looks.
the car  is a great vehicle to drive with all of the bells and whistles.
i just hope that our problems are over!
they state audi will not allow them to repair the mmi issue i had.
audi just makes this navigation really difficult for customers to use.
the first was ultimately traced to the ecm(engine control module).
any feedback would be great.
we had trouble replicating this for the dealer as it would then correct itself when we turned the vehicle back on.

finally, if you are considering a 3.6 liter engine, you need to check out the resonant vibration problem that has occurred at 50 to 60 mph.
hi, i have an 09 q7 3.6 premium s line with  nav for about 2 1/2 yrs now, no problem so far yet except for the poor brake  noise since the beginning.

i offered to pay the $1200 for the repair to be fixed and they declined saying they are scared i will take them to small claims..
i found that all those options aren't that useful since its better  for us to look for the names because it is easier.

here is a video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2bpngfyquy horrible horrible customer service on both sides... what a shame.
they have  had a lot of vibration problems at speeds between 50 to 70 mph.
i am not sure which  is one is technically a better one.
the issue was that the left side mmi buttons  would not workwhen it rained sometimes...
my preference is audi q7 considering into its interior and the exterior.
instead of  letting you pick a name for a poi, you have to pick those criteria that they  give or the address.

other smaller problems include a defective  assembly for the rear roof sun screen.
the dealer has never acknowledged a problem in this area.

occasionally, when turning of  the car, the from would deflate, completely lowering the front of the car while  the back remained at the original height.

i'm not certain  about the q7 or what type of reliability you're looking for, but if you look at  jd powers vds from2005 compared to 2011 you'll see newer vehicles across the  board are much more reliable.

what is this discussion about?
i am just to the point of needing new pads on the front brakes and have  learned that the rotors on these cars are relatively soft and generally require  replacement with each new set of pads.
there have been a number of major problems.

escondido audi has ruined any enjoyment of owning an audi.
audi does not give me that option to manually spell out my  destination.
for example, if  the rotor and brake problem has been fixed for 2009 will the new parts be a  part of the 2007/2008 models?

audi's current score of 161 (which is below average) would rank higher than the 2005's ranking of honda, toyota, acura, infiniti...
so if you trust jd powers...and  want the reliability of a 2005ish toyota...then the q7 would fit.
