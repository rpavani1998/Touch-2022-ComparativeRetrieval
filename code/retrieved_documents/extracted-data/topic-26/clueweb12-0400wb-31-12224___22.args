if a manufacturer is too lazy and too ignorant to come up with an accurate and appropriate name they don’t deserve my business.
i like them, but if i need a sedan, i prefer having the solid b pillar and framed door glass.
they’re what i look forward to buying someday with the excuse to my wife that it’s still has four doors, so we could fit some kids in there if we need to.
combine the words “four-door” with “coupe” and you incite controversy, as mercedes-benz quickly found out with its cls-class.
it’s probably the most iconic sedan shape ever and there’s a reason that shape is so iconic.
i remember first hearing about that and getting all excited that someone was finally building a phaeton again, only to be hugely disappointed when i saw it and the top didn’t go down.
so in a hardtop, if the windows were down, you could run your hand from the wing window to the c-pillar without hitting anything.
the passat is the only practical one, for the rest i’m not wealthy enough to treat cars as fashion accessories, so no.
if i’m going to drive a car large enough to warrant a usable back seat then i want 4 real doors and maximum practicality.
as far as an alternative to 4 dorr coupe, which is retarded, sportback is not a bad alternative, not great, but better than 4 door coupe.
if you trade every 3 or 4 years or aren’t going to put a lot of miles on a car,it’s not much of a consideration, if you drive the wheels of vehicles then you’ll want to keep it in mind !
i agree with most here, i love the aesthetic, but hate the name.
report: four-door baby amg will get supercharged v-6, not turbo four 2010 geneva:
i like the sleeker sedans too, but then i love the sedans of the late 1950′s when they all sported long low profiles.
i was just blown away by the shape if that car.
funnily enough, with the exception of the am rapide, the cls, the cc and the gran coupe concept look more like normal sedans with their flattened.
they look so sleek, when done correctly of course!
however, a coupe is “a 2 seat, closed vehicle, smaller than a sedan according to mr. webster.
instead of just calling them coupes though, they need to affirm that they are sports sedans.
i refuse to have my intelligence sniffed at by anyone.
it does things to my innards that cars arent supposed to do.
i am also growing fond of the panamera as well.
i wish we would dig up some great name from the early days of the car that means the same thing, or re-tool something, like how some automakers are tempting the idea of bringing back the idea of a shooting brake here in the u.s. just give me a new name to call them, that sounds simple and reasonable, and i’ll be cool.
the four-door coupe style is awesome, and i think they make great alternatives to the traditional sedan/saloon.
as long as i’m the driver and not a rear passenger.
it is still a sedan like it or not, coups are 2 doors, sedans are 4 doors, for people with small families, who don’t want to be caught in a station wagon.
they can also catch others off surprise.
the cars aren’t too bad, but they’re all german.
they look very nice.
to me, it seems that the germans don’t like the word sedan or saloon for the four door vehicles.
coupes will always be 2 doors in my book.
it makes for the most solid structure and while great strides have been made, the fact is frameless windowed doors will rattle before framed ones.
but vehicles like the porsche panamera or the new hyundai sonata do it all wrong lol looks > practicality.
i agree with uraniumdragonn…they need not invade the coupe name.
the cc looks very plain when not next to other boring vw’s on the dealer lot, and the cls has a very anonymous front end.
sedans have 4 doors; that’s what makes them sedans.
on another note, the window sticker for my 1992 mercury cougar claims it’s a 2 door sedan.
its as stupid as the sports activity vehicle crap from bmw.
if sedan doesn’t fit, make up a new name for the class, like “crossover” instead of “tiny suv”.
but then you see them for the first time in person, and it all makes perfect sense…..they are all (including the vw cc) beautiful cars.
they certainly look nice, but they’re not really for me.
i sat in one and it was so so terrible it totally took away from the sleek styling… i like the new bmw the best.
i loved it so much, if i were a billionaire, i would go after that car just to put it in my garage, even if i could never drive it.
the sedans, especially the 2-door ones, were considered rather low in prestige; the hardtops cost more and were seen as much cooler, tho yes, the windows would soon rattle or leak and hardtops were structurally awful in a roll-over.
am still builds real coupes after all.
the aston martin is beautiful, but i not even thinking of one day owning it.
vehicles that the aston rapide or the mercedes cls have done it perfectly.
and i like them much better than their more upright looking siblings.
whatever it is, that car is probably the most beautiful 4-door i have ever seen.
they’re stylish, yes, so people who care about style should buy one.
the bmw concept looks pretty plain overall, and i’d consider the aston a true 4-door supercar, not a coupe.
my wife loved it to and she hates four door cars.
the cls amg is awesome.
a car with a greater interior volume is technically a two-door sedan, not a coupé, even if it has only two doorshttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coup%c3%a9 love them especially the old ones the 1957,58 cadillac eldorado broughams.
if it has 4 doors it’s a sedan.
marketing departments can call it whatever they want, but it will always be a sedan.
i think they (especially the bmw) look much better than “ordinary” sedans.
it just meant a 2-door car with a pillar between the side windows, as opposed to a 2-door hardtop, which didn’t have one.
i can’t really picture those cars with only 2 doors.
so long as they look good.
however, i think the terminology, “four-door coupe”, is mostly helpful in the design studio as a descriptor of design intent, but should stay there.
combine the words “four-door” with “coupe” and you incite controversy, as mercedes-benz quickly found out with its cls-class.
they’re not to my taste (if i wanted a car that large, i’d want something more practical), but it’s nice that they’re a part of the marketplace.
the whole “four door coupe” thing is an oxymoron, and the engineers and designers put too much work into the cars and made them too stylish to be force-fit into an oxymoronic name.
you can get a cheaper version of their “sedan” counterparts.
by that definition, i don’t like coupes because i don’t want a small back seat.
if the automakers can find a better names for themlike audi whith the sportback that would be much better than a four door coupe and iwould love to have one of these its nice and bractical they’re so dumb!
the headlights on it look a little odd but it was just the overall shape and the emotion, strong, sleek, yet romantic and feminine.
i’ll accept 4 door coupes when i see a 2 door sedan.
they are beautiful moving pieces of artwork.
