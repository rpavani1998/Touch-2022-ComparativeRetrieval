i know some other luxury brands offer this feature and it comes in handy, especially when traveling on freeways where the speed limit can fluctuate between 65 and 70.it also offers nice perspective and can be customized to your viewing preferences.in the case of our x3, bmw provides these handy guide lines that show the immediate space behind the vehicle if you back straight up and yet another set of guidelines that depict where it will end up if you crank the wheel one way or the other.the screen has rich color, the picture is large enough to show more than the half block i happen to be on, and it has plenty of room to show street names even when zoomed pretty far out.by ed hellwig | march 9, 2012 our x3 is equipped with bmw's driving dynamics control (ddc) system which bundles various adjustments together into driver selectable normal, sport and sport+ modes.our x3 has bmw's latest take on headlight design and it's slightly more complicated version of its traditional design.although it may not make much difference from a strictly functional perspective, aesthetically it's a nice touch.the back-up camera is part of the technology package that will debit your checking account by $3,200(!!).this x3 is very much a 3 series on stilts, so it turns, accelerates and stops like a small sport sedan.the lights themselves work well and they don't look half bad when they're glowing eerily after you hit the unlock button.other drivers might not feel the same way and find these guide invaluable.the x3 was pretty memorable for its inebriated throttle response and the subtlety of its efficient dynamics initiative (only a sticker on each rear window and the blue/red fill gauge monitoring my eco habits every time i lifted off-throttle).last time i drove one, more than a year ago, it was nice and steady and competent.it's got surprisingly good range.that's why i have to tip my hat to cars, like our 2012 bmw x3, that automatically detect your phone's name when you connect it.
