according to all the reviews i found, reliability is average, and customer satisfaction with the a3 is outstanding.it is a shame because they have always served my family well and the cars have become the new benchmark with many others trying to keep up.all cars in fact have significantly improved their vehicles in terms of quality.sadly,german cars of all makes are suffering from the effects of the 'making them at the lowest cost' process.the cars have always been the best option when you are looking for something a little more comfortable and unique over other german brands.in fact, my opinion of the other two major german builders, mb and bmw, has diminished with my also having reliability issues with each model i have owned.cost cutting and no concern for the history of the brand is destroying the german car market.the cost of a quality german luxury sedan is much too high when compared to the prices asked by acura, infiniti and lexus.the car gets 25 to 30 mpg and is a technical and design tour de force.although on paper the body designs, engine specs and interior ambiance really appeals to me, the extremely poor reliability of these machines keep me from even considering them again for purchase.the quality of audi and that of bmw needs to be improved .what i want in a high-end car is to be able to drive it each day and not simply wait for the shop to repair it.except for the '74 100ls and '85 gt, all have been exceptionally reliable.these cars are built to last 400-500,000 milesin terms of build quality i will always think german engineers are top notch.
