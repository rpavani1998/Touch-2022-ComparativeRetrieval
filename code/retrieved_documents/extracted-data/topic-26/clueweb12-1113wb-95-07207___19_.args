mounting inline engines in a longitudinal manner would encroach not only in safety but also in the interior cabin, as far as interior dimensions are concerned.a lot of hybrids today would actually perform a lot better if the gas and electric worked together whena lot of hybrids today would actually perform a lot better if the gas and electric worked together when launching.a lot of the reason people are moving to smaller turbo engines is the fuel economy that can be had, remember there is a mandate for cars to have a minimum epa rating.problem is, luxury and fuel economy are usually at odds with each other, as anyone truly concerned with fuel economy is less concerned with pampering oneself, showboating and seeking prestige by blowing money.they will also appeal to the practical mass that want to drive something nice but still get good mileage.luxury is about being able to do as you wish, about not having to worry about the little things and about enjoying life.and it's actually probably a hinderance for audi's fwd cars but a significant part of audi's engine block hangs over and in front the front axle which increases "plowing" and nose-dive effect when cornering and/or braking.i get your point but the popularity of the a4 and audi's ever increasing sales seems to suggest that the 4-cylinder engine isn't holding back sales despite the price.with volvo's desire to go more upmarket, they do need a power train with more cylinders than four.they need to come in just under the above mentioned price points and do so with more standard features.i understand that a small displacement engine (e.g. 4-cyl) can be tuned to have high output, but a 4-cyl power delivery and sound is just not sophisticated.on the other hand, our engines (up to this point) have always been inline (with the exception of the 4.4l v8) whereas audi uses v6s and v8s.there are 'performance hybrids' as well, meaning the hybrid tech is used to augment the gasoline engine, ie: porsche cayenne hybrid drive-train; or the ill fated honda accord hybrid.forced induction/di be what it may, pushing that much air into small engines will cause more long-term problems and work the engine that much harder.
