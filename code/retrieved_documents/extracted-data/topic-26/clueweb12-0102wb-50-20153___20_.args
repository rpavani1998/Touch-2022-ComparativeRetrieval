they are very reliable and good quality.the honda accord v6 is a great choice–the styling is exceptional for a non-luxury brand.it will attain 29-30 mpg at 80-85 mph and handles well.the lexus’s were very reliable, comfortable great for long trips, etcit’s reliable and gets 32 mpg on the highway, but it’s super delicate, has tons of rattles, and i’ve never been able to get comfortable with the way it drives.every car company has vehicles that go wrong eventually, no matter how good their reputation is.it does cost some money to keep it running to audi specs, but the thrill and quality can be priced.it would help the economy being made in america.i might also look at hyundai’s and kia’s as well as nissan’s and other ford’s as my family have owned those vehicles in the past and have had good experiences with all of them.most cars, especially now are up to a standard that will surpass anything from 10 years previous to that model year.replacement tires are very expensive, an oil change is right at 100 dollars, a complete four wheel brake job is north of $500.00 and since i live in lower alabama where virtually all terrain is flat, there is no need for exceptional handling, not to mention the high cost of insuring it.that way i can plow, haul, tow, and drive in the snow easier.those companies make the best vehicles on the planet.my friend has a 2002 and it’s been really reliable for him, but the fuel economy is pretty bad.let me add that they have been very reliable, and that the saab gets 27.5mpg 40/60 city/hwy, while accord gets 30.5mpg 20/80 city/hwy !!!!
