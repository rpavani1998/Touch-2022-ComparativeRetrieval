i couldn’t go the rest of my life without an suv or a sports car so i say: 1.
(yeah, lets load up some home improvement supplies in an aventador.
this is for me and the goobstar yo listen, we love the hood.
one that has been driven daily since new?
written by: christian seabaugh [g+]  on february  23 2012 5:00 pm earlier this week we played desert island in our thread of the day, and  asked you to pick five cars – three cars for you, one for your  significant other, and one for your teenager – that you’d want to  be trapped on a desert island for all of eternity with.
awd beast i love the new 2013 ford escape with all new intelligent access push button start and hands free liftgate.
i hear it’s a blitzkrieg of speed.
an m3 isn’t practical.
lmao that’s really gonna impress all the f150-driving contractors over at lowe’s.
the 505 hp race track edition one with all the sports goodies and luxurious goodies and carry myself and him, and maybe a friend in ease.
with gray rocker panels awesome ford wheels and a moonroof/sunroof
say what you want, it has never failed me or prevented me from getting to where i have to go.
lots of nice choices so far, too.
fast, gorgeous, convertible with power top, four seats (not that the back are big enough to fit anything but children), good size trunk, excellent looks, and german reliablity (which some would debate, but in my experience with bmw products, excellent) and not horrendous gas milage.
+1…im with ya bro-ham.
sporty looks and performance, awd for bad weather, seats 4, 5 in a pinch, and does have some carrying ability, at least for the things i would be hauling.
jeep grand cherokee srt8
if you had to choose just one car, what  would it be?
looks good, sounds awesome, goes fast, has plenty of passenger and cargo room, can go almost anywhere to do anything, and did i mention the sound?
if offroad wasn’t in question, then it’s a tie between a 911 and an m3.
all the car you could possibly ever need actually nvm on the gt-r. i just imagined spending every day in a nissan and it was a miserable thought.
i’d take ford mustang with 5.0l v8, neither svo nor shelby.
hate to see $5 plus a gallon gasoline.
in that case, with maintenance costs not considered, i would go with a range rover sport in autobiography trim.
i rode in the 6.1 at the srt track expierence and was nothing but impressed and can only imagine the new 6.4 is even better.
how’s that for practicality?
well, assuming i hit the mega millions or something, the car i would have in my driveway would be the new panamera gts.
my life would be that car, i’d make love to it, kiss it daily, buy it flowers, anniversery gifts each year, my wife would probably leave me for spending too much time with my other girl (gtr), etc.. i’ve been in love with skylines since i was a kid, i’ve waited for years for them to be released stateside, and now that they finally are, i’d literally give away a kidney for one..
so that i can personalize it to my own.
programmed obsolescence.
and if it’s snow you’re concerned about then move to where it isn’t so crappy in the winter and buy a car that’s actually fun to drive, and not be stucck with a big clumsy truck that’s trying too hard to make it’s owner look macho.
i’ll drive it and only it for ever and ever with a kool-aid smile on my face.
are u kidding 2013 srt viper!!!
here are the rules: before we turn things over to you, a couple things to keep in mind – this will be theonly car you will ever have for the rest of your life.
although, a 1974 de tomaso pantera-l would be nice.
1947 chevy pickup, 1935 coffin nosed cord ,army jeep old easy to work on.2007 subaru legcy 5 door,and finley 1979 toyota pickup.
lol all you guys that said sports cars, good luck when holidays season comes around…lol only a chick would be concerned about having enough room for holiday gifts and mall runs.
hey, they picked my topic for ‘thread of the day’.
but i don’t have the garage space.
2012 dodge charger srt8 i already own it.
not even a camry solara.
plus if the apocalypse comes i know it will still continue running.
it has plenty of room in the rear seats for a family, has a decent to large trunk for anything you might need to transport, its a convertible
super power, practicality and driving dynamics.
final answer= cts v sedan.
a ram 2500 larime longhorn crew cab, the diesle version cause it will last forever range rover.
for every driving purpose, a sports car works great for me.
would consider wagon but won’t need it when kids get older.
nothing like a hemi!!!
range rover evoque coupe dynamic in that light green color w/ a black roof eww leave a reply cancel name (required) email (required, but never shared) web 2012 cadillac cts-v suggested price $63,215
if they make scuff marks, they’ll have to live in the cupboard under the stairs without food for a week!
since these only get about 14 miles to the gallon.
i can rup in it with my buddies and if gas gets expensive, the goob can let me borrow his smart for two skyline r34 v spec.
so you could truly enjoy it your entire life, it has probably one of the most timeless looks you could possibly imagine and its is an absolute joy to drive.
the 2012 dodge charger sxt awd 8-speed auto in black with the 20″ wheels no doubt a 2012 ford expedition el green (yes they offer green for 2012)
v60 plug in hybrid over 300 hp and 480 lb-ft of torque to go along with my 129 mpg should do me quite well… plus, no one said i couldn’t modify the hell out of it!!!
asfrisky_dingo said, “if you pick a veyron now, and five years down the road have a family, you’re walking everywhere, or cramming them in the luggage compartment.”
not to mention that i’d take it with hard top, not convertible… too girly for me.
the ones with kids all drive suburbans or euro wagons.
and it’ll hit 163…while still looking great 25 years from now!
before we turn things over to you, a couple things to keep in mind –  this will be theonly car you will ever have for the rest of your life.
asfrisky_dingo said, “if you pick a veyron now, and five  years down the road have a family, you’re walking everywhere, or cramming  them in the luggage compartment.”
my choice would be an infiniti fx 50s, white with a black interior.
matte black lamborghini aventador.
sorry if my comment sounds like “fanboy”.
alternatively i would like a range rover sport because it can tow and go off road like a big suv but is also sporty like an m5.
the car that i would pick if i had to have only one car for the rest of my life would be the audi rs6 avant.
cts-v wagon gets the honorable mention.
figure kids are too big for back seat of a sedan then its time for them to move out…lol either the caddy wagon, v version of course, or the jeep srt8.
i’d get the automatic mybach exellero with that i can buy all the cars i want i would have to go with the lexus is-f 400+ rhp, and a very beautiful car.
i’ll stick with my 2007 nissan xterra off road.
a cts-v wagon with a 6 speed!
i prefer more of a roomy 5 seater like the new audi s6.
a hummer h1 alpha open top.
perfect size, shape, entertaining and decent mileage.
moving on, my choice was a panamera turbo s.
plus if it isn’t really windy out i can get 22 mpg on a 16 year old truck.
that said i was thinking a suburban ltz would do the trick, but then i thought about something i’ve always wanted.
…while decimating any car to race next to it** hmm..
the kiddos will be required to take off their shoes and climb in the back seat very carefully.
the ferarri ff is another candidate.
one car for the rest of my life 1959 rambler 4 door,lay back seats,has a lot of room.
if i had endless resources, than it would have to be the ferrari ff, blood red with camel interior.
didn’t expect so many reasonable answers.
nice choice except for the color choice, and i would also of added a 6 speed manual since your adding a crate motor anyway might as well have a little fun cost no object?
thread of the day: what is gm’s very best vehicle?
1970 plymouth superbird with the hemi 426 in petty blue!!!
to me, just one car means it needs to do just about everything i want it to – decent mileage, fun to drive, hauls stuff and moves people when needed and fits on crowded intercity streets.
so im hoping to see future focuses get an overall avg of 40 or better with a stock 200hp engine – will love it even more ford black 1986 lamborghini countach qv,totally impractical,totally outrageous,still the definitive supercar chevrolet equinox.
probably with the candyapple red, or presidential blue paint, two timeless colors as well.
plus what cant a m3 not do than an m5 cant, the m5 is to heavy while the m3 is just perfect did you not see the word ‘practical’?
if you had to choose just one car, what would it be?
it has the style the speed, the handling, and i can use it for everything.
both would have to be red of course!
and for the record, i’m guessing the cts-v will be the most popular answer.
if u need a car for more than 2 people…..(as a ford guy i can’t believe i’m saying this) the cadilac cts ur not a ford guy if u want a caddy can i get a whoa raptor!!
[g+] on february 23 2012 5:00 pm earlier this week we played desert island in our thread of the day, and asked you to pick five cars – three cars for you, one for your significant other, and one for your teenager – that you’d want to be trapped on a desert island for all of eternity with.
but i never see gay guys driving them.
mercedes benz g55 amg.
of course i would have to do some extensive customization to make the interior a little more comfortable and roomy, as well as converting it to bio-diesel, and maybe adding four wheel steering (i love my current suburban and the quadrasteer is the reason i won’t give it up).
i recently purchased a 2012 focus sel.
the car i’ve enjoyed driving more than any other i’ve owned on a day to day basis, is my 1965 thunderbird convertible.
probably a subaru wrx 5 door.
i’ll take the bus 6 days a week just so i can drive my aston martin on saturdays around the island on which i live…maui.
the shift paddles need to be fix before buying i buy one lol, and the magnetic ride just kills it, its also roomy and very good looking, the regular cts v just looks as if it was cut with an axe while the wagon has some good style and performence
thread of the day: choose one car from each decade for your own garage thread of the day: if you were a billionaire, what would you drive? 2011 chrysler 200 convertible alternatives to big family cars five most expensive repairs
….or just give me a camaro zl1 …caddy xts ( -v if available) black diamond edition.
the one i have now, 2004 pilot, smooth, comfortable easygoing transportation from point a to point b and it does everything i could ask of it without complaint, even at 8 years of age.
twin turbo 2.8 liter pushing 500 hp.
i would drive my ford f150 fx4 supercrew-ecoboost amen bentley continental gtc.
it’d get pretty bad gas mileage, but it can outrun most everything out on the roads and it can go off-roading too!
vw jetta sportwagen tdi.
a 1958 black impala with white roof and 60k original miles.
911 turbo s a 2011 white/gold two tone chevy silverado 1500, crew cab,4wd.
and do not have to worry about replacing transmissions with the allison
it’ll go anywhere, tow anything, carry anybody, while decimating any race next to it.
wide open throttle thread of the day:
for me… 2013 nissan gt-r black series!!!
ferrari 250 gto, but i’d settle for a 250 gt swb.
i mean, it’s got everything.
indeed range rover what i have now, a 2006 nismo equipped 350z, i’d love to go small like a range rover evoque, but i need more room for the kids, dogs and towing capacity.
as an added bonus i won’t have to worry about the body disintegrating on the hummer!
i would have to go with a cts wagon as first choice with mustang gt as second choice.
mt classic home » wot » thread of the day:
with a ls1 5.7l create engine , instead of the 5.3l.
1st choice; 997 911 turbo s- before they mutilated the steering.
the g-wagen is bulletproof already, brabus makes it better.
s65 amg lexus lx5700, not fun to drive, but do everything.
in dash touch screen navigation all options……… awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
actually, since this is reality, i would go with my weekend cruiser.
it’s gorgeous, turns heads everywhere, and it has a “cool” factor that only gets better with time.
while the bmw m3 is funnier and faster it has a tiny trunk and back seat.
saw one the other night in the movie “tony rome” with frank sinatra.
and there we all go suggesting cars that get crap for mileage… which is an imminently practical consideration, no?
there is no correct answer to this question.
here are the rules: it has to be a factory-offered production vehicle, so concepts,  prototypes, and modified vehicles (likefrisky_dingo’s “g37 with a gt-r driveline” example) don’t count.
it’s a tough choice between the mb e63 wagon or the jeep grand cherokee srt8!
that thing’s a beast!
my wife said a porsche cayenne turbo s!!!
what does this have to do with my ultimate car choice?
panamera turbo s and the cts-v (coupe and wagon) are both on my list coincidentally.
that’s a practical answer to the question at hand.
well, practically speaking, it’s only going to be me and my significant other, with no chances of kids.
i would pick some supercar im not saying it is not a reliable engine, but it has only been out a few years, we do not know what it will do once it starts to age lol u guys nailed it, the cts-v wagon, mine is in red though rolls-royce phantom drophead coupe bentley continental gt camry!
what the funk is autobiography trim on a range rover??
it doesn’t handle like a sport car, and i’ve owned faster vehicles, but it’s one of the most comfortable cruisers i’ve ever driven.
black audi quattro s1 e2.
the brabus g v12 s biturbo would be my pick.
i like awd fast cars!!!
besides, who wants to go through life with a car that every time the proper rr pulls up next to you your embarrassed?
thread of the day: 2011 bmw 5 series, mercedes e-class, or audi a6 — choose one thread of the day: what cheap coupe would you choose?
if i’m living in a warm climate (no snow)
plus, i could live with that turbo-5 every day of the week land rover 110 series iii diesel, post 1982.
mercedes e63 wagon hands down, it’s fast, it’s comfortable on long trips because it’s a big mercedes, handles well, and it’s a wagon that seats 7
with that in mind initial responses from the staff include thecadillac cts-v wagon, audi rs4 avant, and porsche panamera turbo s – all practical, yet fun.
maserati granturismo sport.
i also wouldn’t mind a dodge challenger srt8 for my weekend driver.
so if you squint it’s kind of a mini van.
i’d pick the new cayenne turbo.
still looks awesome years after it when out of production money an object….
991 porsche 911 turbo s….gotta love the porsches!
yo goob where are you at?
cadillac coupe deville.
fast, gorgeous, luxurious, and has four doors so its still practical a new 2013 bmw m6.
the fun of a convertible, the torque to tow whatever i want, the ability to go anywhere, and room for the family.
written by: christian seabaugh
money no object… ford gt.
the other thing is it is basic, yes it does have some electronically controlled parts but it is nowhere near the amount that is on the cars today, plus if the electrical system ever wears out (i doubt it) just bolt up a carbureted small block and convert the fuel delivery.
eh, i’ll take the e63 wagon.
today’s thread of the day is a play on that theme.
can’t buy a new head light bulb, they’re discontinued now almost 7 years.
there’s a lot of offroading going on where i live so it’d have to be an suv.
going work to home in a mustang is so cool.
haha, i like awd fast cars too
inluding repair and maintenance costs?
good pick — they were pretty cars.
porsche 911 (991) carrera s is-f mercedes e-class coupe.
gt-r with prices rising at the pump, and me on the highway all the time id pick.
is that even a questions?
blue 1969 yenko camaro 911 turbo s….ill have short kids i hope.
no automobile has even been manufactured to last decades.
enough about us though, have at it in the comments below.
cadillac cts-v wagon.
easy my chevy k1500 ext-cab small block v8.
and has room for a family!
it’s fun, fast, and practical.
good for any stage of the rest of your life.
aston martin rapide people can’t be serious when answering with an exotic sports car.
i’ll take a ford raptor.
i thought everyone would be answering cts-v, e63 amg or m5 wagon.
don’t need to say much more than that
covered-headlights ferrari 250 gt tour de france: a thing of beauty is a joy forever.
aston martin rapide if i can pay for the insurance and gas.
without a doubt a 2012 mercedes-benz s65 amg designo mystic white edition.
to me, this is one of those apocalypse situation questions where you have to think what would be the best car given any possible situation.
raw power and beauty.
mercedes cl65 amg or e63 amg wagon….
6.2l v8 has proven to be a solid engine along with the super duty rear diff and axles with the weigh of an f150 and the 600% stronger suspension will last for ever!!!!
any old or new bentley would do in a pinch!
xd i once knew a young lady who, if you looked at her objectively, was not very attractive, yet she exuded a sensual aura that made every male in any room she entered take notice.
but, i would suffer… ha ha.
jeep wrangler unlimited rubicon, go anywhere, do anything!!
it can fit 6 people and still carry what is needed.
i’d have to say, my all time favorite.. 2013 nissan gtr (specv or some other special version preferably), black on black..
i’d take an m5 over an m3 sedan 7 days a week.
money no object..hopefully that would include upkeep and gas…then i would want to have a 76 cadillac eldorado biarritz ragtop… ct-v wagon!
practical for you====laughable horseshit for myself.
oh i could live with that cts-v wagon but would prefer the cts-v coupe.
i think so… how is that gay?
with that being said, it would have to be a jaguar xj-r, i believe.
cts-v black on black wagon and since it will be for the rest of my life
ooooh, those are tasty.
you guys must be chicks!!
and in 60 years it will still look like something that just rolled off the production line what about tuned cars?
thread of the day: more straight-line speed or better handling?
toyota supra twin turbo ::.
then again it only has 22,000 miles on it.
you can’t put a 4×8 sheet of plywood in the back of a real range rover, much less a sport!
gas is going to 5 bucks a gallon
couldnt agree more,, it is very rare to see a cts v wagon in th street, but what a magnificent car, i would take it automatic, because is faster.
no breakdown worries?
categories: audi, cadillac, porsche, thread  of the day related motor trend articles thread of the day: 2011 bmw 5 series, mercedes e-class, or audi a6 —  choose one thread of the day: what cheap coupe would you choose?
but a cts-v sedan is very, very close.

golf tdi ford excursion with 7.3 diesel lancia delta integrale evoluzione ii.
i test drove a 2011 cts v sedan and was very impressed.
aston martin dbs of mclaren mp4-12c or not of i would desire a rolls royce phantom.
what more could i want?
seriously all u need is a raptor 4 door fast, fun, looks awesome, fits a ton of stuff!!!
gmc sierra denalli, i do a lot of hunting and fishing, and it is a decently fast truck supercharged range rover, fast, fun and big.
the cts-v because it is like a station waggon dragster.
plus you can never get bored adding stuff, lifts, headers, tires, bull bar, heck you could turbo or supercharger it for all i care, but the point is the list is endless
for today’s thread of the day, frisky_dingo asks the question, “if you had to choose justone vehicle to own for the rest of your life, to be used for every purpose and driving need, what would it be?”
jeep wrangler cod/mw3.
srt8 jeep grand cherokee.
i’ll hire a limo anytime i need to carry people or luggage..or have my wife drive.
i have yet to find a german car that can provide more usability than the rs6 avant.
if i’m living in a cold climate (four wheal drive needed) then i’d have to go with porsche cyanne turbo.
2nd choice; nissan gt-r (r35) 3rd choice; db9/s figuring out a practical sports car wasn’t as hard as i thought it would be.
brabus is a factory, so i abide by the rules.
im thinkn one of the bmw m550d awd wagons.
1969 mustang convertible with the 351 windsor, four on the floor.
can’t believe only 1 person said ford raptor!!!
there’s a ’66 hardtop for sale near me
the question is which car you yourself would want most.
big, beautiful, comfortable, and literally big enough to live in! aston martin v-12 vantage in black please new 2012 bmw 328i sedan.
but if you have a wife and 3 kids a gtr won’t work.
hey 40rouge, not everyone is a bob villa wannabe, ok?
i change my answer to a 2009 honda s2000.
it has room, i can do whatever i want with it, less chance of getting stuck, and it may just run forever.
a smart for two for the goobstar and me: i changed my mind..a caprice classic for ever.
bentley mulsane all the way, big luxurious, and fast.
1st option was a brabus g55… 2nd is a koenigsegg agera r, the best looking and most exciting car to date.
can’t buy the retrofit headlight kits that ford used to offer to install conventional halogen bulbs, they have been discontinued for 5 years now.
it’s the brabus version of the g-wagen.
wait… “what cant a m3 not do than an m5 cant” lolwut the car in the picture!
cadillac cts-v sedan.
nice, i would take it if it was a 2dr model.
the car can be new or old, it doesn’t matter; keep in mind it will  be your only car, for the rest of your life and maintaining something like a  vintage jaguar e-type might be troublesome.
the m5 cant cut it being only rwd and the amg e-class wagon is for men who have a burning desire to be a woman at heart!
there’s one for sale right now on ebay motors, go check it out.
the question was one car for every driving purpose.
m5 touring (wagon) cts-v & e63 amg both in wagon form.
mclaren f1 lm a 3500 silverado with diesel.
that’s realistically other wise
for today’s thread of the day, frisky_dingo asks the  question, “if you had to choose justone vehicle to own for the  rest of your life, to be used for every purpose and driving need, what would it  be?”
1955 studebaker president speedster.
its very suburban household.
you’re left with shade tree engineering to make something work, either that, or you just don’t drive after dark.
some like myself live just fine and dandy with a two seater that hauls nothing but ass.
one of the few hyperexotics.
i wonder why… even if you try to maintain a car meticulously, the manufacturer will step in and purposely stop making parts to dash all hopes to keeping the thing in good running condition: exhibit a: the 97-98 lincoln mark viii.
since it’s late and i can’t make up my mind.
the m3 kills the m5, have you heard of the # 200 fuse, is a disgrace to bmw m’s
a smart for two would do a perfect job btn me and the goob.
how many of us are driving a car from the 80s at this point?
sporty, roomy and endlessly classic looks.
okay, it wouldn’t be practical, but what a pretty car.
1975 ford f-350 crew cab, 460 c-6 with air conditioning blue and white two tone paint job a 2003 mercury marauder (and there’s no way a vehicle i own isn’t getting modified for increased performance and fuel efficiency some way or another).
i can drive my family to the mall and go out on the track.
space inside for people and stuff and extremely luxurious.
it’s got the size, engine, and awesome interior.
i can’t think of any gay guy i’ve ever met who drives a camry.
awd for crappy weather, convertible for good weather.
with that in mind initial responses  from the staff include thecadillac cts-v wagon, audi rs4 avant, and porsche  panamera turbo s – all practical, yet fun.
if it had to be for the rest of my life keep improving on it.
better all-around type of car.

get me on the waiting list for the lambo aventador.
both will shock an untrained eye and can turn rubber into smoke with ease aston martin rapide.

if i was able to do minor modifications, corvette zr1, i’d put a towing rig on it, that car wouldn’t have trouble on power, just need to strengthen the frame and suspension.
and since it has the 1 of the 100 million small blocks produced in the past half century, i don’t think parts are going to be hard to come by.
