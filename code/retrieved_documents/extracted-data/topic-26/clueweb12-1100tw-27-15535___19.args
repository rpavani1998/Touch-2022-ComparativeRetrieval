when it comes to the interface for the cabin's electronic comfort and convenience features, the audi gives up its leadership, as mmi is awkward to use relative to both bmw's idrive and mercedes' comand systems.
we might beat you to the next stoplight with the 328i, but we wouldn't fault you for your choice.
at 21.6 mpg over 684 miles, the all-wheel-drive audi isn't as miserly.
the automatic transmission is slow to respond and no complement to the least powerful engine in this group.
our tester was fitted with the standard six-speed manual transmission.
and from mt just last month; a4 - 5.8 to 60 and 14.4 1/4 328i - 5.6 to 60 and 14.2 1/4 and also from that test, for those of you who complained about the 19" wheels/tires bmw doesn't offer, as if that is audis fault for doing so and for thousands less too; a4 with 18" wheels/tires - 0.91 g and 25.9 sec.
the c250's 24.7 mpg came during 680 miles of mixed driving, but the 328i wasn't far behind at 23.6 mpg over 1,455 miles.
the a4, which is the most controlled car here when tossed around, is downright snappy by comparison.
the c250's 24.7 mpg came during 680 miles of mixed driving, but the 328i wasn't far behind at 23.6 mpg over 1,455 miles.
it won't surprise anyone to know that the slowest car in the group earns the best fuel economy.
place: 2012 bmw 328ithe most powerful and best all-around driving car here, the 328i also offers a sublime mix of efficiency and luxury.
it's this resourcefulness in combination with enduring quality that makes the 2012 bmw 328i so profoundly effective in this segment.
the winner that we're giving the win in this contest to the 2012 bmw 328i is a product of its do-all abilities.
hooklyn says: 10:23 am, 03/20/2012 @ mcmiskulin i am calling them biased because that sole fact you illustrated is seemingly why it won.
there's less athleticism in the c250 than either of the other cars, although the problem isn't so much the chassis as the powertrain.
this is a product of the same optional s line plus package that gives the a4 the interior detailing we love.
he doesn't know how much power each car is putting to the ground.
the return is there, however, with epa numbers offering a 5-mpg increase in combined fuel economy for the turbo-4 versus a normally aspirated inline-6 (27 mpg vs. 22 mpg).
the interior provides the same familiar feel of a recent-generation 3 series with a touch of updating, and to our eyes the exterior styling easily makes it the best-looking car here.
the bmw recorded 66.7 mph in the slalom while the benz reached 66.2 mph, and both pulled 0.88g around the skid pad.
just the fact that the 3 series 6 speed manual trans now gets better economy than the 8 speed auto is suspicous no matter what you think of the bmw.
the audi's superior grip showed itself again in our braking test, where it stopped from 60 mph in only 108 feet.
combine these stats with a power advantage and the bmw is easily the quickest car here in a straight line.
there are also brushed aluminum inlays and a black cloth headliner.
choose either the six-speed manual transmission — as in our tester — or the eight-speed automatic (a $1,300 premium) and you'll get all-wheel drive as standard equipment.
we'll make this simple: when it comes to drag racing, the right physics will win.
i just always remember the germans as not having the best electrical systems in their cars...
also, the benz offers the least headroom in the group by about a half inch.
(an eight-speed automatic is a zero-cost option unless you opt for paddle shifters, which add $475.)
the 2012 bmw 328i sweeps both straight-line tests by hitting 60 mph in 5.9 seconds (5.5 seconds using a1-foot rollout like on a drag strip) and passing through the quarter-mile in 14.1 seconds at 98.9 mph.
six-speed shift-it-yourself a4s — like our test car — are rated at 25 mpg epa combined.
a continuously variable transmission (cvt) is available in front-drive models only.
six-speed shift-it-yourself a4s — like our test car — are rated at 25 mpg epa combined.
the bmw gets better fuel economy ( and don't bring up the numbers in test reviews because they all admit that they disable the start/stop feature and never run it in the economy mode).
of course, you can forget about adjustments in cornering attitude from the chassis when you're in the middle of the corner, but these matter less when the other cars are already dots in the rearview mirror.
so we drove on, dug deep into our quiver of hair-splitting tools and began to tally the notes.
the c250 and 328i recorded stops only 4 feet and 7 feet longer, respectively.
the bmw doesn't inspire you to attack any back roads, but it offers a prudent degree of mountain-road-handling prowess to complement bmw's classic formula for all-around success.
of course things like gearing, and drivetrain loss, and what have you will effect it but my point is that church doesn't know that information either.
i am not ignoring gas mileage either because it is unfair to compare the 21.7 mpg figure for the 3,662 lb awd audi with the 23.7 mpg figure of the 3,427 lb rwd bmw...
but if your vertical dimension pushes the 6-foot mark, the missing inch will make a difference on longer trips.
what's more, bmw's turbocharged, direct-injected 2.0-liter inline-4 is rated at 240 horsepower and 255 pound-feet of torque, which amounts to 10 hp and 55 lb-ft more than last year's normally aspirated 3.0-liter inline-6.
of course this fee includes some stupendous options, the most costly of which is the $3,600 premium package.
still, we could option this car with more restraint and keep it competitive with the a4 and c250, and yet still lop nearly $6 grand from its sticker price.
most of the public knows their consumer report reliability rankings, but they keep gobbling them up.
the bmw rides better then the audi.
we have to ask why the audi handles best and if the benz's anvil-like solidity is important.
the bmw won because it is a bmw.
it's ironic that the audi, which comes standard with all-wheel drive and provides the most sophisticated suspension configuration in the group, offers the lowest base price.
audi's a4 is the next most expensive car here, although its $45,675 bottom line is $5,070 less costly than the bimmer.
the new 2012 bmw 328i wasn't walking away from its competition, as have so many 3 series models in pastinside line comparison tests.
character counts perhaps the most defining trait of the mercedes-benz c250 is the simple, honest way it goes about every task.
a continuously variable transmission (cvt) is available in front-drive models only.
the benz approach to this four is similar in concept to bmw, and this turbocharged, direct-injected 1.8-liter inline-4 cranks out 201 hp and 229 lb-ft of torque.
truth is, you won't go wrong with any of these cars.
pathos says: 10:24 pm, 03/19/2012 hooklyn, get a live girlfriend and you might find that you are posting less.
in fact, this entry-level 3 series has been equipped as a showcase of bmw options, so our 328i tester tips the scales at a wage-crushing $50,745.
but if your vertical dimension pushes the 6-foot mark, the missing inch will make a difference on longer trips.
so you should know, then, that part of the reason the audi handles the best is because it's fitted with the widest, stickiest tires wrapped around the biggest, heaviest wheels.
objective handling tests, though, fall largely in favor of the audi, which has the quickest slalom speed at 69.2 mph and best lateral acceleration at 0.92g.
the mix yields a 25-mpg combined rating from the epa.
this now gives the bmw parity with the audi a4, which increased the length of its all-wheel-drive platform in 2009 in an effort to achieve handling dynamics more like a rear-wheel-drive car.
although the c-class lacks the cruise-missile speed of those bigger cars, it delivers the same carefully controlled body motions when you're behind the wheel.
the benz, hampered by its automatic transmission off the line, is slowest.
as different as the bmw and mercedes-benz might seem in concept, the 328i and c250 were much the same in these tests.
bmw's fear is justified.
the economy/power compromise the ever-tightening noose of corporate average fuel economy (cafe) is no doubt responsible for shanghaiing two cylinders from this most established bmw model.
it handles better, brakes better, has a nicer interior (so says i/l), has equal or more features, and costs $5k+ less with the addition of awd.
the audi was better in every single other way.
the interior provides the same familiar feel of a recent-generation 3 series with a touch of updating, and to our eyes the exterior styling easily makes it the best-looking car here.
the bmw looks better then the audi (my opinion and the authors).
fact is that both cars are 100% equipped meaning the bmw doesn't come with high performance 19" wheels/tires.
by our estimation, the honor falls squarely to the audi.
if you're of average build, you'll have no trouble finding room in the back of the benz.
this sea change aligns the entry-level version of the 3 series with its four-cylinder competitors, the 2012 audi a4 and 2012 mercedes-benz c250.
all three systems integrate navigation, phone and audio controls into a menu-based knob-and-button interface, but audi's system is less elegant and integrated in its design than the others.
inside the cabins with a 2-inch stretch, the wheelbase of the bmw 3 series now measures 110.6 inches.
the audi's superior grip showed itself again in our braking test, where it stopped from 60 mph in only 108 feet.
the victory, though, comes with the caveat that your needs might demand other priorities better served by the supremely good audi or benz.
the c250 and 328i recorded stops only 4 feet and 7 feet longer, respectively.
even with the advantage of all-wheel drive during the launch, the a4 couldn't hold its edge in getaway quickness all the way to 60 mph.
there's less athleticism in the c250 than either of the other cars, although the problem isn't so much the chassis as the powertrain.

the cost goes up very quickly from there — way up.
so you should know, then, that part of the reason the audi handles the best is because it's fitted with the widest, stickiest tires wrapped around the biggest, heaviest wheels.
dollar-for-dollar, the bmw cannot nearly compare to the audi for features and equipment.
but bmw isn't alone in introducing a four-cylinder power plant to this segment of premium sedans.
the new electrically assisted steering isn't communicative on a granular level, but it isn't going to repel anyone either.
2nd place: 2012 audi a4standout handling, interior quality and an awd powertrain make the a4 unique, but they don't make it better than the 328i.
credit for this accomplishment goes to the s line plus option package, which adds faux suede to the a4's standard leather on most critical seating surfaces.
sixty mph arrives in 7.3 seconds (6.9 seconds with rollout) with all 1,320 feet passing in 15.3 seconds at 90.7 mph.
even when you limit the options on the bmw to match the audi's price, the bmw is still the better all around car.
just because they prefer the bmw to the audi doesn't mean the bmw is a better car.
$50k 328i mcmiskulin says: 04:22 pm, 03/21/2012 @hooklyn again, you fail to actually read the article and you ignore the facts.
of course, the downside to bedrock solidity is, in this case, a less engaging driving character.
the manufacturers provided edmunds these vehicles for the purposes of evaluation.
even the bmw website (which is conservative both on 0-60 times and hp) shows the manual at 5.7.
this sense of overbuilt purpose is a kind of dna trickle-down from the small benz's larger, heavier brethren, the e-class and s-class.
all it does better, according to this test, is get to 60mph and through the 1/4 5% faster.
the new electrically assisted steering isn't communicative on a granular level, but it isn't going to repel anyone either.
if we lived in colorado, we'd buy the 2012 audi a4 and ditch the 19-inch wheels and tires in favor of a choice with lighter wheels and better-riding rubber.
the 2012 mercedes c250 is marginally more costly than the a4 at $45,900 including the premium and multimedia packages.
this is a product of the same optional s line plus package that gives the a4 the interior detailing we love.
but bmw isn't alone in introducing a four-cylinder power plant to this segment of premium sedans.

and by "sporty feeling" we mean stiff, because the car's ride quality is compromised by this setup.
my current car is rated at 16/24 and i get 22-23 in very spirited mostly city driving.
a downshift, which requires a lateral slap of the shift lever on the console, slurs between gears with a throttle blip that's only marginally effective in speeding the process.
choose either the six-speed manual transmission — as in our tester — or the eight-speed automatic (a $1,300 premium) and you'll get all-wheel drive as standard equipment.
the a4 is marginally slower to 60 mph at 6.2 seconds (5.9 seconds with rollout) and is a half-second back at the quarter-mile with an effort of 14.6 seconds at 94.1 mph.
meanwhile, the 328i included driving dynamics control, bmw's own electronic overseer of throttle, steering and damping, and the optional adjustable dampers of the adaptive m suspension certainly helped this 3 series be all things to all people.
the 2012 mercedes-benz c250 has a wheelbase of 108.7 inches, and while the 1.9-inch difference hardly makes this car small, it does translate into about an inch less rear legroom.
there are also brushed aluminum inlays and a black cloth headliner.

the 2011 audis should have the same times as the 2012.
for some reason , i'm not really even interested in test driving them , either.
i know which car is objectively better and after all of this info you should too.
at 3,427 pounds the bmw is 98 pounds lighter than the c250 and 235 pounds lighter than the a4.
also, there's the $2,550 technology package and $2,500 sport line trim.

and go to bmw and audis websites and build each of the cars.
the benz also wins the timeless contest in door-slam quality with a heavily damped thud that sounds like play doh landing on bedrock.
also, since early dyno testing of the bmw show it's hp to be understated, it makes it less likely that bmw would lie about the epa numbers.
the c250 also could have benefited from the optional $1,530 dynamic handling package, which adds adjustable dampers and a variable steering ratio to the c-class, but it wasn't fitted to our test car.

audi drive select, a $2,950 option, would have mitigated the impact of the big wheels and tires by tuning the throttle action, steering assist and damper action to suit different driving circumstances, but it wasn't a part of this a4's option package.

3rd place: 2012 mercedes-benz c250less capable as a driver's car, but bedrock-solid build quality and trickle-down driving character from its larger siblings make the c250 a solid choice.
what's more, bmw's turbocharged, direct-injected 2.0-liter inline-4 is rated at 240 horsepower and 255 pound-feet of torque, which amounts to 10 hp and 55 lb-ft more than last year's normally aspirated 3.0-liter inline-6.
figure-8 and; a4 quattro as tested mileage - 16.6mpg 328i rwd as tested mileage - 16.8mpg rwd and that audi was almost $7,500 cheaper in that test.
with 18" wheels/tires - 0.90 g and 25.9 sec.
all-weather ability, for example, might be necessary.
combine these stats with a power advantage and the bmw is easily the quickest car here in a straight line.
the 2012 mercedes c250 is marginally more costly than the a4 at $45,900 including the premium and multimedia packages.
of course, the downside to bedrock solidity is, in this case, a less engaging driving character.
the a4, which is the most controlled car here when tossed around, is downright snappy by comparison.
if you're of average build, you'll have no trouble finding room in the back of the benz.
it won't surprise anyone to know that the slowest car in the group earns the best fuel economy.

these are all very good cars.
objective handling tests, though, fall largely in favor of the audi, which has the quickest slalom speed at 69.2 mph and best lateral acceleration at 0.92g.
sixty mph arrives in 7.3 seconds (6.9 seconds with rollout) with all 1,320 feet passing in 15.3 seconds at 90.7 mph.
and secondly, you say the bmw won because it is a better car.
no matter where we drove the bmw, we liked the experience, even if the car might have lacked a little something compared to either the audi or mercedes.
my 2000 bmw 323 was epa rated at 21/26 and i got 26-27 combined all of the time and almost 30 on trips that were all highway.
audi drive select, a $2,950 option, would have mitigated the impact of the big wheels and tires by tuning the throttle action, steering assist and damper action to suit different driving circumstances, but it wasn't a part of this a4's option package.
i want it progressive ,direct, and adjustable w/ my right foot and hands.
the a4 is decidedly the most sporty-feeling sedan in the group as a result.
the benz approach to this four is similar in concept to bmw, and this turbocharged, direct-injected 1.8-liter inline-4 cranks out 201 hp and 229 lb-ft of torque.
