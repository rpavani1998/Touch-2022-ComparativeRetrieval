sure... everyone wants to sound like an expert...
the "fair" comparison is not that easy; s4 may be between 335 and m3 and not necessarily a direct competitor to either.
so spending the $46-60 grand puts you as well in the bmw 335i territory...so thats a bunch of pesos for the bmw as well, not only for the audi.

it dlu says: 05:44 pm, 10/13/09 you can't get an m3 for less than $65-70k in the boston area; the early s4's out now are between $55k to $60k here.
but still can't see spending the $46-60 grand on it when its bumping into m3/is-f price territory.
earlier reports hinted that the s4's supercharger might make it slow off the line -- this comparison test made me a fan of the new s4 alman08 says: 07:08 pm, 10/13/09 i like how hondacura4 has to define "direct competitors" for every car.
the latest challenger is the 2010 s4, a newly supercharged, all-wheel drive sedan that has been realigned to better match up with bmw top 3 series four-door.

however, the quattro audi just punched the rwd bimmer in the gut as validated by this comparison test.

if you want to see a direct audi vs bmw m3 comparison you will have to wait until the audi rs4 debuts.
s4 is nice but that price is steep.
so you have to take the as-tested price difference with a grain of salt.

latest poll gas prices are on the rise again and are expected to hit $5/gal again.
3 series, the s4 vs 335 comparison is perfectly logical and valid.
the audi may be the better performer but it's not worth the extra coin in my eyes.
i can get a 335i 6mt sedan the way i want it for around $46k, which i consider pricey.

i like the 3l supercharged motor though.
lexus is-f i never said you couldn't compare the 2 but its obvious the m3 would have the advantages right out of the box.
the s4's performance is impressive but its price isn't.
what i got out of this (and c&d's) article is that the awd is easier for someone like me to exploit its abilities and get more fun out of.

according to car & driver, when you option the bmw up to match the standard equip on the audi, then add the sport package to both cars they are within a few hundred dollars of each other, and the audi has awd (a $2k option for the bmw).
it sevenbob says: 12:56 pm, 10/13/09 crcr_driver i just went to the bmw site and put every option on it for $70,770 you can get it with the double clutch transmission and premium package for $60,075.
it was only a few years ago when audis would give you more for your money than mbs and bmws.
but i wouldn't pay $60k for the audi or the 335 if it were that expensive.
