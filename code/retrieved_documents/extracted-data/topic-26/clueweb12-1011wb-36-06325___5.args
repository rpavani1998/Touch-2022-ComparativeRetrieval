the x3's cruise speed up/down button (rocker switch on left wheel spoke) works like an auto down/up power window switch.
out of curiosity, i checked out other long-termers that had that automatic-closing tailgate feature to see if they offered the same locking convenience.
i checked the audi's manual to see if it would clarify how you can lock the car by just hitting that close button but all itsaid was "press the button in the rear lid.
but i had to capture the moment when tech-savvy, 20-something matt couldn't figure out that this was a mobile phone dock.
there are instances where it's nice to soften the ride up a little or quicken up the shift speed on the transmission, but it's often very subtle.
only thing that would make the x3's system even better is if it, like the fiat, didn't have a limited number of slots to fill.
press it briefly and beyond the initial travel (through the "click") and the preset speed automatically moves up or down to the next multiple of 5mph.
that's why i have to tip my hat to cars, like our 2012 bmw x3, that automatically detect your phone's name when you connect it.
while engaging in a rare driving condition recently (an open freeway in l.a.) i engaged the x3's cruise control.
but i'm sure that's an issue families wouldn't take umbrage with.
our 2012 bmw x3's is my current favorite in our fleet.
i like it because i don't have to dig out the key fob in my bermuda triangle of a purse to secure the car.
our x3 has bmw's latest take on headlight design and it's slightly more complicated version of its traditional design.
our long-term 2012 bmw x3 xdrive35i (say that 5x fast) has a fancy-pants back-up camera system.
fancy, in that you can personalize several of the settings throught the idrive controller.
so, if you have a third passenger who is sitting in the middle, you are out of luck.
that's how i thought i'd feel after driving our x3 for the first time.
driving around in "normal" mode i never once felt the need to sporty things up a little.
in | follow inside line 2012 bmw x3: bump it up by john dipietro | march 16, 2012 while engaging in a rare driving condition recently (an open freeway in l.a.)
as some of you know, one of my hobbies is a geeky gps-based activity called geocaching.
by john dipietro | march 8, 2012 after popping the x3's hood to check the oil (before realizing it has an electronic oil level monitor), this warning showed up both within the instrument cluster and on the navi's monitor.
the lights themselves work well and they don't look half bad when they're glowing eerily after you hit the unlock button.
elastic strap thingie, stationary tiedown anchors, sliding tiedown anchors, flip-down grocery bag hooks, watertight well (lower right), ac 12v power outlet.
hard to tell as this point, although as leds become more flexible, the designs are only going to get more complicated.
made me wonder, though, how much the average buyer really cares.
by ed hellwig | march 9, 2012 our x3 is equipped with bmw's driving dynamics control (ddc) system which bundles various adjustments together into driver selectable normal, sport and sport+ modes.
push it lightly and you can adjust the speed by one or more mph, depending on how long you hold it there.
press it briefly and beyond the initial travel (through the "click") and the preset speed automatically moves up or down to the next multiple of 5mph.
the editors got a breaking news tip for the inside line editors?
the x3's cruise speed up/down button (rocker switch on left wheel spoke) works like an auto down/up power window switch.
this x3 is very much a 3 series on stilts, so it turns, accelerates and stops like a small sport sedan.
for a compelling video on how easy it is to connect an iphone, hit the jump.
it's got surprisingly good range.
last time i drove one, more than a year ago, it was nice and steady and competent.
in the case of our x3, bmw provides these handy guide lines that show the immediate space behind the vehicle if you back straight up and yet another set of guidelines that depict where it will end up if you crank the wheel one way or the other.
the technology is there.
other drivers might not feel the same way and find these guide invaluable.
instead, i would go slow, look over shoulder, adjust my line as i went in and largely ignore whatever the guide on the screen said.
the x3 was pretty memorable for its inebriated throttle response and the subtlety of its efficient dynamics initiative (only a sticker on each rear window and the blue/red fill gauge monitoring my eco habits every time i lifted off-throttle).
now, just about vehicle has some signature light cue up front, some more interesting than others.
by ed hellwig | march 12, 2012 you may have noticed a greater number of new vehicles with odd looking headlights.
it also offers nice perspective and can be customized to your viewing preferences.
additionally, the new x3 was designed in california.
usually, the defroster's heating elements (the orange lines) run horizontally across the rear window.
i know some other luxury brands offer this feature and it comes in handy, especially when traveling on freeways where the speed limit can fluctuate between 65 and 70.
in fact, all x3s -- regardless of the country for which they're destined -- are built in spartanburg.
although it may not make much difference from a strictly functional perspective, aesthetically it's a nice touch.

i then tried just standing there til the lid closed.
this is when i noticed the cruise's bump up/down feature.
i tried the sport and sport+ modes on our x3 and didn't find them much better than the "normal" mode.
the one thing i do know is that i don't really trust them much.
by albert austria | march 15, 2012 bmw manufacturing co in spartanburg, sc, produced its first vehicle, a 318i, on september, 8, 1994.
the screen has rich color, the picture is large enough to show more than the half block i happen to be on, and it has plenty of room to show street names even when zoomed pretty far out.
i've generally been of the opinion that a well-tuned suspension/transmission/throttle setup shouldn't really need or even offer adjustments.
push it lightly and you can adjust the speed by one or more mph, depending on how long you hold it there.
as you can see, the x3's are arranged in concentric fashion, echoing the sweep of the wiper.
i mean, he uses an ipad as his store's cash register!
when you lower the center console in the rear seat, you can access two pop-up cupholders.
along the way we encountered sand, rocks, and the three w's of the desert: washboard, washouts and whoop-de-doos.
this is when i noticed the cruise's bump up/down feature.
i wanted to be underwhelmed - especially after driving the new f30 sedan and soaking up the new turbo-four and revised chassis.
i really like this feature in our 2012 bmw x3; that you can just hit that lock button which will not only lower and close the liftgate for you, but will also lock up the car.
our x3 costs twice the price of our mazda 3, so you naturally get twice the screen.
personally, i like that bmw hasowner's manual videos.
kidding aside, it's nice to know that bmw cares.
the leather color that i mention is officially called nevada chestnut.
a group of eleven of us piled into three vehicles and headed out into the undeveloped triangle of open desert between highway 395, highway 58 and interstate 15 for a day of short hikes split up by miles and miles of driving on faint tracks that barely register on aerial photographs and satellite images.
the reason i'm not sure is becausesometimes when i hit that close tailgate button the audi will make that sharp, high-pitched beep that the car is locked but it won't do this every time.
by donna derosa | february 28, 2012 as i mentioned yesterday, our mazda 3 has one of my least favorite map screens.
next thing you know, you'll see warnings on coffee cups cautioning java junkies that indeed that beverage is hot...
by dan edmunds | february 27, 2012 this is one of the better and more established roads our 2012 bmw x3 traversed this past saturday.
but at least this area's very sparse rainfall and a tendency for high winds keeps the size of the plants in this area down to where the paint wasn't at much risk -- if i was careful.
i know some other luxury brands offer this feature and it comes in handy, especially when traveling on freeways where the speed limit can fluctuate between 65 and 70.
the back-up camera is part of the technology package that will debit your checking account by $3,200(!!).
the rear lid moves to the closed position by itself and soft close locks it automatically."
i tried hitting the button and walking a little bit aways.
so much for changing a bulb in front of the auto parts store.
