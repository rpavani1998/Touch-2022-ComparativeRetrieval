just a shame the car didn't drive that well.....
i don't claim i need a top system in a car, but i've had the optional upgraded speakers, to get decent sound reproduction.
my e39 had the comms pack and the sound was terrible until i fitted a sony sot amp, even then it was just passable.

my e61 has good bass and reasonable quality sound, i have purchased the l7 tweeters to make it a bit better but it really isn't that bad.

audi always have had top sound quality from day one even on my old audi 80 coupe on a d plate the sound was fantastic and never bothered to upgrade as there was need to ..
do a google search as it has been covered loads...

i'm going to look at the little tweeter upgrade soon (assuming i don't already have them).

this is a far inferior system to the e39.

my 530d is perfectly fine although it does go to pot if i turn it up too loud.
utc i have no idea if mine is in any way "upgraded" from stock or not, but i came from a saab which has the worse stock system ever fitted to a motor vehicle in the history of the gramaphone!!

so i dont understand what's happened to yours maybe you need some new speakers?
the e60/1 cars i've driven have all been the basic systems and do lack, imo, and need an upgrade option.

i'll pop in the tweeters detailed in a guide here, but the door speaker - ist it a £2 chinese one and is there mileage in upgrading it?
and i have to say that the e60 has a very poor set up for a premium car.
fri, 23 mar 2012 11:00:56 utc i have to agree.

happened before here unlike the e61 the e39 included tweeters and mid range door speakers that didn't fall apart with bass and start hitting the end stops and buzzing in the doors - i'm using the same disk here (tiesto ) - and it didn't run out of puff and flat line on every bass hit at reasonable perky volumes .

but i do come from the time when bmw didn't even fit a standard radio, and you chose the system anyway.
i'm very critical of it sorry - probably more so as i do a lot of sound mixing work in my job.
i have had the audi bose system before and that was brilliant, enough to convert me back from ipod to cd's, but the bmw setup just seems to have no depth.
not a cat in hells chance i am spending £600 on an upgrade to it.

the sub's under the seat are in an excellent place, but there are loads of forums showing you what you can do for about £600 - upgrading to a proper amp, better subs and speakers generally.
is it possible to keep the controls on steering and still show i drive when on display?

the ml was truly awesome.
top of the range car my ar$e - the system is below basic competence.

i'll try to input the e39 into the newly discovered 'secret' options list finder - but by top of the range car stds e61 is just not good enough.

if played quietly it really sounds impressive to the point you want to turn it up and that impressiveness will maintain at high volume but it doesn't it turns to mud.
