these two german rivals are (and have been) close in performance and the nod for value has often gone to audi.audi interiors are so good, one would expect the japanese would simply copy them as they have, historically, copied so many other things.with this new platform, i think audi is poised to make a serious run at the segment leader bmw.now, who knows, the audi quality meter is certainly at a relative zenith but we need at least a few more years of the kind of reliability these c6's seem to represent to cement this with the us buying market.the new segment a7, which is covering the space between a6 and a8 is till now been good in impressing all the luxury seekers in its long distinctive look as well as its soothing features.audis reputation for unintended acceleration, its financial woes at the time and a better bmw dealer body by far far farmore performance (year round) better warranty and service agreements, lower lease payments and tail lights shown to the bmw due to far more torque from the audis (at lower dollars and for equal dollars.)its rivals like bmw gt and mercedes benz cls seem to be on different tracks and offer a varying platform.hopefully we can discuss the need for audi to increase horsepower in the 6 cylinder range, with light turbo charging as well, ala bmw, or the older, but excellent 2.7t motor.anyway, audi has a lot of stuff in the pipeline that looks exciting and quite possibly class leading (at least for 15 minutes) -- and i for one continue to believe audi is more like the cars it is often compared to than it is different.reading history, the bmw reliability was not heads and tails better than the audis over the years.the s6 beating the m5 in two magazine comparos is certainly a reason to consider audi as a serious competitor.the a4 segment is quite awesome in both performance as well as value for money.i would argue the quality and fit and finish and design often favored the audi line.the fact that they often outsell each other is, at the very least, suggestive.
