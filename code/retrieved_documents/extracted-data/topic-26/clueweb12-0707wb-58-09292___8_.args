they have had a lot of vibration problems at speeds between 50 to 70 mph.it was then towed to the nearest dealer where it took them a week to diagnose the problem and get the necessary parts from europe to fix the car.audi just makes this navigation really difficult for customers to use.audi's current score of 161 (which is below average) would rank higher than the 2005's ranking of honda, toyota, acura, infiniti...finally, if you are considering a 3.6 liter engine, you need to check out the resonant vibration problem that has occurred at 50 to 60 mph.i'm not certain about the q7 or what type of reliability you're looking for, but if you look at jd powers vds from2005 compared to 2011 you'll see newer vehicles across the board are much more reliable.other smaller problems include a defective assembly for the rear roof sun screen.i also feel that the seal coat of the paint is soft leading to a finish that is more easily chipped with road debris..of course if you trust jd...and only care about reliability then it looks like a lincoln mkx (going by manufacturer) would be the winner.escondido audi has ruined any enjoyment of owning an audi.i found that all those options aren't that useful since its better for us to look for the names because it is easier.so if you trust jd powers...and want the reliability of a 2005ish toyota...then the q7 would fit.the car is a great vehicle to drive with all of the bells and whistles.audi does not give me that option to manually spell out my destination.audi q7, suv messages page 67 of 67 search this discussion go to msg # - « previous - 1 - ... - 63 - 64 - 65 - 66 - 67 - next » - last #659 of 668 certified preowned q7's by dpix oct 15, 2009 (8:18 am) i've been researching the 2007 & 2008 q7's here on edmunds and i see that people seemed to have issues with the brakes and rotors going bad at about 18k.
