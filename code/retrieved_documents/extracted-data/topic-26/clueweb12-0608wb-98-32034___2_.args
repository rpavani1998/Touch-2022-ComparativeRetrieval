its torsen centre differential directs power to all four wheels, on-road and off-road, which means fast-reacting power to whichever wheel can best deploy it and excellent lateral stability - the prerequisites for optimum driving dynamics and safety.steel spring suspension and twin-tube shock absorbers are designed for sporty driving and superior comfort, even off-road.this features a state-of-the-art common rail injection system with piezo inline injectors helping it to a peak power figure of 240bhp, a substantial torque rating of 500nm and reasonable fuel economy.the driver benefits - also thanks to virtually balanced axle load distribution - from even better agility and steering precision that remains practically free of torque steer.one can't really underestimate the importance of this vehicle to audi, a company that looks set to belatedly diversify into some previously profitable market niches.there's also a trailer stabilisation system which reduces the risk of fishtailing via targeted brake intervention.this sits below a powerful 4.2-litre v8 petrol unit also featuring fsi direct injection which cranks out a healthy 350bhp with a peak torque figure pitched at 440nm.with an all-wheel drive pedigree to be proud of, and enough badge equity in the tank to drive premium sales, audi have seen rivals such as bmw, mercedes, porsche and volvo clean up.the chassis of the audi q7 contains numerous aluminium components - independent wheel suspension with double wishbones at the front and rear - also excels with its all-round qualities.the tilted position of the rear spring and shock absorber unit reduces overall height and creates more room at the rear.with a length of 5,086mm and a wheelbase of 3,002mm, the q7 isn't the most nimble rock hopper, but it does feature variable ground clearance (from 180 to 240mm), hill descent assist and an off-road mode whereby the esp stability control system backs off to allow for loose surfaces.it runs on a stretched version of the volkswagen touareg chassis and features a seven seat configuration, making it ideal for bigger families.audi even offer contrasting body colours in a bid to emphasise the car's shapely profile.i always liked the allroad, a pragmatic vehicle that was more competent than most would require off road and had a reassuringly car-like feel on the tarmac.this is a car which has a sensibly tarmac-biased set-up, from its 60:40 torque split to its 18-inch alloy wheels.
