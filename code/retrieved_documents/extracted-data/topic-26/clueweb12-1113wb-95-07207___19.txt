and of course, still no clue at all  on the premium for their hybrid powertrain.
what luxury features does a current volvo not have?
maybe volvo should think of dropping cloth and going to the fake leather as standard also?
i'll bet most people don't even get 'r' anymore or know where it came from.
gnarsh_darkwatchreply with quote well said, and i can answer your question directly: first, rear wheel drive and secondly, 400+ horsepower.
there are 'performance hybrids' as well, meaning the hybrid tech is used to augment the gasoline engine, ie: porsche cayenne hybrid drive-train; or the ill fated honda accord hybrid.
touring 5mt 1996 ram 1500 i didn't really think about that and don't really know the implications between the two different front wheel drive setups.
mounting inline engines in a longitudinal manner would encroach not only in safety but also in the interior cabin, as far as interior dimensions are concerned.
we all know the 2.5t and the v8 get very similar mileage figures on a  tank of fuel.
audi actually offers a true s, bmw a true m, and mercedes the amg.
the collaboration  with polestar might one day evolve into more, but for now sport volvo's are out  of the question.
suggests to me that volvo does not want to invest in an aging platform that will replaced before long.
problem is, luxury and fuel economy are usually at odds with each other, as  anyone truly concerned with fuel economy is less concerned with pampering  oneself, showboating and seeking prestige by blowing money.
it's a feeling/aspiration that they're really something better.
i don't think they think the xc60 and s60 are lagging behind the luxury brands but the other automobiles like the s80 need to be redone to catch up with the times.
we all know the 2.5t and the v8 get very similar mileage figures on a tank of fuel.
i would not place an s audi on the same level as an m or amg vehicle.
a lot of the reason people are moving to smaller turbo engines is the fuel economy that can be had, remember there is a mandate for cars to have a minimum epa rating.
the whole r-design thing is something everyone does - sport  look packages are offered by many manufacturers, including the amg package from  mb (not the actual amg cars).
the s4 falls in between the 335i and the m3 but it's closer to the 335i.
1st off, fwd architecture is usually transverse, but subaru and the upper-echelon of audis use a longitudinal configuration and still offer fwd base models.

my wife who is not a car enthusiast at all commented that the audi [really 4-cyls in general] sounds like every 16-year old's honda.
it has been officialised by ceo stefan jacoby.

i don't agree with the "bottom feeders" part but this raises a good point.
they need to come in just under the above mentioned price points and do so with more standard features.
although, of course, i don't think anybody has answered yet exactly where volvo's currently are falling short in the luxury dept.

its unremarkable in its outward appearance, just another two-story warehouse-type building tucked in along a wide, tree-lined parkway.

another debate is just how 'established' the r name even was given that of all the brands, it was at the bottom of the list and never really ever taken that seriously.
on the other hand, our engines (up to this point) have always been inline (with the exception of the 4.4l v8) whereas audi uses v6s and v8s.
this  company cannot make up it's mind what it wants to do.

the only different is that they aren't limiting their models to the smaller engines (except the a4), just offering them. .
they are the future so i am glad i like them.

the previous  4-banger-exclusively announcement will keep them out of consideration, except  on the compact-car front, with the c/s/v 30-50 cars.
but for the last twenty-five years, this place, better known as the volvo monitoring and concept center, has been the american home for a small handful of the swedish carmakers best thinkers.
there hasn't been an r for a while.
and yet today's t6 r-design is in many people's eyes the sportiest volvo ever.
they are too  enviro for that and will focus on efficiency instead.
hyundai has this, nav, rear camera, and heated seats front band rear, bluetooth, and infotainment in the new azera at low 30s.

full story stefan jacoby revealed that the companyâ€™s next wave of products will move upmarket to compete with other established luxury brands (bmw, mercedes-benz and audi in particular).
and it's actually probably a hinderance for audi's fwd cars 06
volvo isnt going to skim off many hardcore audi or bimmers folks.
what gives with only a na 6 cylinder in a vehicle of the xc90's size?

i don't know who would spend 30-40-50k for a car with a 4-cylinder engine.

audi also has a 4-cylinder in the a6 and bmw has one in the 528i.
the only different is that they aren't limiting their models to the smaller engines (except the a4), just offering them.
they need to focus on style, simplicity, luxury features, and economy and win.
problem is, luxury and fuel economy are usually at odds with each other, as anyone truly concerned with fuel economy is less concerned with pampering oneself, showboating and seeking prestige by blowing money.
and it's actually probably a hinderance for audi's fwd cars but a significant part of audi's engine block hangs over and in front the front axle which increases "plowing" and nose-dive effect when cornering and/or braking.

i'll bet many will think that just having the extra letters somewhere on their car along with the styling will to others maybe look like the real thing.
i think that volvo needs to work on its interiors to make them more on the level that you mention.
but does the california volvo monitoring and concept center in camarillo have a lobby with any public displays or mounted drawings of their concept vehicles?
the new bmw 328i is also a turbo 4 (and i really hate the way it sounds).
the power delivery and sound of my t6 are worth the price of admission.
and when they read their magazines and drool over the s, m, and amg reviews, and then they go to buy a regular model car, but then see a cosmetic 'package', well, they know the meaning behind it.

i understand that a small displacement engine (e.g. 4-cyl) can be tuned to have high output, but a 4-cyl power delivery and sound is just not sophisticated.

worrying about 2 mpg here and there is not luxury.
same with the 335is/m3 coupe and the s5.

and a key part of the article is just about getting down to only 4 cyl engines.
forced induction/di be what it may, pushing that much air into  small engines will cause more long-term problems and work the engine that much  harder.
