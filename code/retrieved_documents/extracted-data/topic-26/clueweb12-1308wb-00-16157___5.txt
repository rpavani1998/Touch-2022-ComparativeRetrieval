the a4 is a revelation; it’s our new class-leader.
it has better body control than any of its rivals and feels sure-footed in corners.
ergonomically, it’s superb, and there’s lots of steering  wheel and seat adjustment, plus ample stowage space.
the layout, quality and feel of the cabin, which features the same dash as the  a5, is smarter than any rival’s.

it is a fantastic car to live with on a daily basis and i think it is a wonderful vehicle on the motorway.
other engines include an impressive 1.8-litre turbo petrol, plus v6 diesel and  petrol powerplants.
list prices undercut a 3-series, insurance  ratings are competitive, retained values are impressive and fuel economy strong  (although the exceptional bmw beats it on this score).

the audi is streets ahead of both of them in comfort, handling, looks and performance the best car i have owned well done audi by lynchie on 22 december, 2009, 10:40am i bought a new a4 exec s line 2.0 tdi in november and having had an a4 se
if we were being critical, the plastic  panel on the dash-mounted cd changer is a bit shiny, although it only stands  out because everything else is so impressive.
i have had lots of comments about what a good looking car it is

the most popular engine is likely to be the 2.0-litre tdi, and it too has an impressive range of abilities.
small trim line-up, not quite as economical as a 3-series driving dynamically, the latest a4 is a  revelation.
the newcomer has  a distinctively sporting appearance, but it’s still unmistakable –  not just as an audi, but as an a4.
natural rivals are the bmw 3-series and mercedes c-class; these german models dominate the compact executive saloon sector, but rejuvenated ‘mainstream’ machinery such as the ford mondeo and mazda 6 will also claim to be good-value alternatives.

and i have to agree, it is.
if we were being critical, the plastic panel on the dash-mounted cd changer is a bit shiny, although it only stands out because everything else is so impressive.
an avant estate sits alongside it in the line-up.
it’s firm but not harsh, and excellent damping means the a4 is taut  without being unforgiving.
the newcomer has a distinctively sporting appearance, but it’s still unmistakable – not just as an audi, but as an a4.
owning the sense of luxury and attention to detail continues inside; it’s similar to audi’s top-of-the-range a8 limo.
the audi strikes a good balance when it comes to ride quality,  too.
power arrives quickly, is delivered smoothly and it’s also quiet and refined, too.

previously i immediately thought that the suspension on the s line was going to be too firm for me, having had the car for a few months i love it.
it’s been transformed over older models, and seems so much more grown up.
the layout, quality and feel of the cabin, which features the same dash as the a5, is smarter than any rival’s.

the steering is sharp and the turn-in positive, and  while it isn’t as dynamic as a 3-series, it’s far more composed  than a mercedes.
