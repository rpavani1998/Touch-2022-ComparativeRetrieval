and of course, still no clue at all on the premium for their hybrid powertrain.
there are 'performance hybrids' as well, meaning the hybrid tech is used to augment the gasoline engine, ie: porsche cayenne hybrid drive-train; or the ill fated honda accord hybrid.
mounting inline engines in a longitudinal manner would encroach not only in safety but also in the interior cabin, as far as interior dimensions are concerned.
we all know the 2.5t and the v8 get very similar mileage figures on a tank of fuel.
audi actually offers a true s, bmw a true m, and mercedes the amg.
suggests to me that volvo does not want to invest in an aging platform that will replaced before long.
problem is, luxury and fuel economy are usually at odds with each other, as anyone truly concerned with fuel economy is less concerned with pampering oneself, showboating and seeking prestige by blowing money.
we all know the 2.5t and the v8 get very similar mileage figures on a tank of fuel.
i would not place an s audi on the same level as an m or amg vehicle.
a lot of the reason people are moving to smaller turbo engines is the fuel economy that can be had, remember there is a mandate for cars to have a minimum epa rating.
the whole r-design thing is something everyone does - sport look packages are offered by many manufacturers, including the amg package from mb (not the actual amg cars).
the s4 falls in between the 335i and the m3 but it's closer to the 335i.
1st off, fwd architecture is usually transverse, but subaru and the upper-echelon of audis use a longitudinal configuration and still offer fwd base models.
my wife who is not a car enthusiast at all commented that the audi [really 4-cyls in general] sounds like every 16-year old's honda.
they need to come in just under the above mentioned price points and do so with more standard features.
although, of course, i don't think anybody has answered yet exactly where volvo's currently are falling short in the luxury dept.

i don't think suv's need to get much bigger than 6 cyclinders.
its unremarkable in its outward appearance, just another two-story warehouse-type building tucked in along a wide, tree-lined parkway.
wasting gas, otoh, is a good way to show prestige by blowing money.
four cylinders *might* be even be more stupid than turbo fives, unless they are going to start competing with hyundai and kia for the bottom-feeders of the luxury market.
i don't know how successful volvo will be without offering something larger, especially on the s80 and xc90.
if so, we have to analyze just how it is that hyundai and kia are pulling this off, and if volvo is capable of going that far.
1st off, fwd architecture is usually transverse, but subaru and the upper-echelon of audis use a longitudinal configuration and still offer fwd base models.
the 4cyl only things bothers me, as we all know, a small engine needs to work much harder to push a larger car then a slower working larger engine.
i didn't even know the executive package was available on the xc90 since it isn't on the site (unless it is now gone for 2012).

on the other hand, our engines (up to this point) have always been inline (with the exception of the 4.4l v8) whereas audi uses v6s and v8s.
this company cannot make up it's mind what it wants to do.
i would add to that list ventilated/cooled seats seats in more cars and a larger nav screen.
the only different is that they aren't limiting their models to the smaller engines (except the a4), just offering them. .
they are the future so i am glad i like them.

the previous 4-banger-exclusively announcement will keep them out of consideration, except on the compact-car front, with the c/s/v 30-50 cars.
they are too enviro for that and will focus on efficiency instead.
hyundai has this, nav, rear camera, and heated seats front band rear, bluetooth, and infotainment in the new azera at low 30s.

full story stefan jacoby revealed that the companyâ€™s next wave of products will move upmarket to compete with other established luxury brands (bmw, mercedes-benz and audi in particular).
volvo isnt going to skim off many hardcore audi or bimmers folks.
it was quite clear for some time now that the r will not return as that is not the direction the company wants to head into.
and of course, still no clue at all on the premium for their hybrid powertrain.
it is really odd that the ventilated seats are only available on the s80 (i think).

there are other areas where they could improve their interiors, but i am not one to like long winded posts.
capitalizing on the r name was a smart move as it used an established name to give credit to the package where before there was none.
i don't know who would spend 30-40-50k for a car with a 4-cylinder engine.

and it's actually probably a hinderance for audi's fwd cars but a significant part of audi's engine block hangs over and in front the front axle which increases "plowing" and nose-dive effect when cornering and/or braking.

with volvo's desire to go more upmarket, they do need a power train with more cylinders than four.

i'll bet many will think that just having the extra letters somewhere on their car along with the styling will to others maybe look like the real thing.
i think that volvo needs to work on its interiors to make them more on the level that you mention.
the new bmw 328i is also a turbo 4 (and i really hate the way it sounds).
the power delivery and sound of my t6 are worth the price of admission.
and when they read their magazines and drool over the s, m, and amg reviews, and then they go to buy a regular model car, but then see a cosmetic 'package', well, they know the meaning behind it.

"horsepower will range from 150 to 300 for gasoline engines and up to 400 with electrification" originally posted by pattyweb i'm just guessing, but i would think audi is more rear wheel bias whereas volvo is more fwd wheel for the awd setups.
imo, the whole r, r-design, and r-design polestar thing is a marketting screwup.
more durable leather is a case in point.

and with the los angeles auto show just around the corner, it seemed the perfect venue for the newly independent brand to show off just a hint of what its future holds.
i wouldn't care if volvos future is 4 cylinders as long as it's a robust 4 that can put down 300+hp otherwise i'll pass.
i understand that a small displacement engine (e.g. 4-cyl) can be tuned to have high output, but a 4-cyl power delivery and sound is just not sophisticated.
what irks me is that the t6 is available on the xc60 and not on the xc90.
i get your point but the popularity of the a4 and audi's ever increasing sales seems to suggest that the 4-cylinder engine isn't holding back sales despite the price.

it's crazy o me that a $50000 xc60 can't be had with ventilated seats.
luxury is about being able to do as you wish, about not having to worry about the little things and about enjoying life.

hyundai is doing this and i think it will ultimately force fewer and fewer "options" with toyota and honda.
they dropped the r many moons ago, so the performance thing hasn't been part of volvo for many years now.
reply with quote 2011 xc-90 with the executive package has ventilated and massaging seats.

worrying about 2 mpg here and there is not luxury.
same with the 335is/m3 coupe and the s5.
wasting gas, otoh, is a good way to show prestige by blowing money.
it will render the already sad and pointless base toyota avalon, even more sad.
it was quite clear for some time now that the r will not return as that is not the direction the company wants to head into.
forced induction/di be what it may, pushing that much air into small engines will cause more long-term problems and work the engine that much harder.

using my 2007 v70 as an example, i also think that they could change the shift linkage so that it has less of a "cheap" feel when you use the "girltronic."

the reason i bought my s60 over an a4 was the lack of 6-cyl on the a4.
