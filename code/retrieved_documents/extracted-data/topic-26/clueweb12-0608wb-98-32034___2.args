if you had to design what an audi 4x4 would look like, chances are it wouldn't be too far off how the q7 has turned out.
this allows audi to not only lay claim to the most generous second row legroom in the class but also - with the second row slid forward and the rear folded - to also pinch first prize for luggage capacity, a huge 775 litres.
the q7 is equipped as standard with quattro permanent four-wheel drive.
the driver benefits - also thanks to virtually balanced axle load distribution - from even better agility and steering precision that remains practically free of torque steer.
i always liked the allroad, a pragmatic vehicle that was more competent than most would require off road and had a reassuringly car-like feel on the tarmac.
with an all-wheel drive pedigree to be proud of, and enough badge equity in the tank to drive premium sales, audi have seen rivals such as bmw, mercedes, porsche and volvo clean up.
audi even offer contrasting body colours in a bid to emphasise the car's shapely profile.
there's also a trailer stabilisation system which reduces the risk of fishtailing via targeted brake intervention.

this features a state-of-the-art common rail injection system with piezo inline injectors helping it to a peak power figure of 240bhp, a substantial torque rating of 500nm and reasonable fuel economy.
the q7 is a little brasher, although it's still hardly in the military surplus mould.
its torsen centre differential directs power to all four wheels, on-road and off-road, which means fast-reacting power to whichever wheel can best deploy it and excellent lateral stability - the prerequisites for optimum driving dynamics and safety.
one can't really underestimate the importance of this vehicle to audi, a company that looks set to belatedly diversify into some previously profitable market niches.
the twiddling stopped a while back, when audi started work on a secret project.
this sits below a powerful 4.2-litre v8 petrol unit also featuring fsi direct injection which cranks out a healthy 350bhp with a peak torque figure pitched at 440nm.
it runs on a stretched version of the volkswagen touareg chassis and features a seven seat configuration, making it ideal for bigger families.
if you really want to bring the bling, 19 or 20-inch rims are also offered.
let's not kid ourselves here though.

this is a car which has a sensibly tarmac-biased set-up, from its 60:40 torque split to its 18-inch alloy wheels.
the air suspension system could turn your suave estate car into a mud plugger in a matter of seconds without the negative social connotations of larger 4x4s.

the tilted position of the rear spring and shock absorber unit reduces overall height and creates more room at the rear.
the entry-level petrol unit is the six cylinder 3.6 fsi, developing 280bhp.

the q7's off-road aspirations aren't anything much greater than muddy tracks and wet grass.
the allroad was a clever distillation of audi's brand image - cool, well built and ever so slightly self effacing.

the coupe-like dipping roofline isn't standard 4x4 fare, nor are the resolutely horizontal shoulders.
if you can get away from the rugged mud plugging mentality and instead think of it as a multi-purpose estate car on growth hormone, you'll bond with the q7 a whole lot quicker.

if you had to design what an audi 4x4 would look like, chances are it wouldn't be too far off how the q7 has turned out.
the chassis of the audi q7 contains numerous aluminium components - independent wheel suspension with double wishbones at the front and rear - also excels with its all-round qualities.
steel spring suspension and twin-tube shock absorbers are designed for sporty driving and superior comfort, even off-road.
although some may point to the fact that audi have arrived at the 4x4 party just as the richest pickings have thinned, there's still a massive demand for 'sports utes' in the usa and besides, the q7 may be long but it isn't as in-your-face as many 4x4s.
