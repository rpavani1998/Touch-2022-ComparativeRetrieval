theoretically, the rear pipes and the muffler would also get pushed back the length of the spacers, and i figured that would put pressure on the exhaust hangers and move the pipe close to my new springs.
now that i've done it, this isn't ridiculously difficult with the right tools.
the front end installation involved the drilling of 14 holes, the mechanized removal of two bump stops and the intentional destruction of two brackets.
unlike the suspension link bolts, the u-bolts can be torqued to their final tightening spec right now.
now the driveshaft can go back together.
the jeep looks great.
but this way isn't wrong, it's just more time consuming.
i would pretty much have to give the wife the rest of the house in order for her to agree on it.
you've built yourself a raptor... minus a useful back seat, towing capacity, power windows, good ride, pickup bed, leather seats, rearview camera, v8, and oh yeah - a roof.report itreport it eclogite says: 06:01 am, 03/19/12 looks great.
give me an m3 or an evo that will do 95% of that performance, and i can still get a car seat in the back.
here the trailing link has been installed with its mounting bolt also running through the new track bar bracket.
mopar's kit comes with the special tool that helps get a retaining nut up in behind the spring seat...
switchbacks, the fact that most of these trails were not made for vehicles that had engines.
like the front, the rear axle is located by 4 trailing links and a lateral track bar (a.k.a.
i live where we have real winter with a capital w (although not so much this year).
if you don't want your top cut, do not leave valuables in plain sight.
if you don't get jeep's, say, "i don't get jeeps" and leave it at that.
i'll spend a lot of time crawling around underneath to get it done, but three extra inches of newfound lift make it fairly easy.
stabilizer bar ball joints and many strut tops feature an internal hex you're supposed to hold still while you tighten the nut, and it's always a bit of a hassle.
reading this and its prequel were the best hour and thirteen minutes i've spent so far this week.
ratcheting end wrenches work, too, but you have to buy them one size at a time.
the whole point of the jeep is that it's a small, open top, solid axle 4x4.
both ends of the one on the passenger side can be bolted (loosely,) but the one of the driver side needs to hang out for a couple steps while i do something else with its rear mounting bracket.
this spring retainer holds the spring in place at the top, and the bolt goes into an existing hole.
it's time to install the rear half of the mopar stage 3 lift kit with fox racing shox on our 2012 jeep wrangler.
once again their 10 bolts are to be loosened, but not removed.
i'll spend a lot of time crawling around underneath to get it done, but three extra inches of newfound lift make it fairly easy.
you gain a level of knowledge about your ride that you need to have with a 4x4.
a 3-inch suspension lift requires the driveshaft to hang down at a steeper angle.
the wheels work perfectly with the jeep.
there is no logical reason why one would not lock a jeep but will lock a miata or boxster.
work dictates the truck.
the new ones are longer in order to keep the rear differential pinion angle at the proper angle with respect to the driveshaft.
clockwise from the left we have: upper trailing link (with the lower one partially hidden below); limit strap; abs signal wire; bump stop (with the spring partially hidden behind); track bar and in new bracket; fox racing shock; rubber brake hose; stabilizer bar and link.
removing the nub, they say, allows the y-pipe to telescope into the rear pipe a little bit, and the flex in the rubber hangars would make up the rest.
many of us could not comprehend even doing this work ourselves.
this is good advice for any car, soft-top or hard roof.
the rear shocks are the component that defines how far the axle can hang, so they need to come off right away.
the front end installation involved the drilling of 14 holes, the mechanized removal of two bump stops and the intentional destruction of two brackets.
but, i'll counter that by saying many people often need a car now - like when their other one craps out and isn't worth fixing.
mopar later told me this cut wasn't necessary, that removing the nub was enough on it's own and i could do that with the y-pipe still in the car.
you can't take your polaris atv on an off-road thru park camping trip (i.e. where your destination is different than your starting point).
but pushing the y-pipe back has knock-on effects farther downstream.

mopar later told me it's also possible to unfasten the upper end of the hose from its factory mount and
as for the jeep, you can get heated leather seats, power everything, the ride on road is not as bad as you want to pretend you know about it.
first i need to reposition the two tall jack stands and lower the jeep's rear axle onto them with ourrotary lift until the axle's weight is supported and the rear shocks are compressed ever so slightly.
report it report it smilez says: 10:50 am, 03/19/12 i like the versitility of a soft top, but so much more to deal with.
my exhaust hangars will hang exactly as they did before and the pipe slip-joint will engage exactly the same amount.
raptor is a great vehicle but totally different vehicle.
as for the rest, i'll leave it alone.
but for those we must lift the jeep high up on the lift and retire our trusty orange floor jacks.
not everyone has a garage or wants extra vehicles (which entail extra cost, insurance, registration, upkeep, etc.)
i do have to reshape the hard part of the brake line by hand to make sure it clears the stabilizer bar end link, though.
once the brake brackets are loose it's time to raise the lift enough to take the weight off the coil springs and open up a gap so i can pull them out.
scott and i had this plan for a dramatic action shot, with me swinging a hammer while holding a chisel.
your girlfriend already has planty to be embarassed about.
it bolts into existing holes.
and the magnitude of that shift is exactly equal to... ...the length of the short spacer, which goes on the driver side where the pipe points straight back.
ratcheting end wrenches work, too, but you have to buy them one size at a time.
these are exhaust spacers.
about the only vehicle you leave unlocked so that no one cuts into your soft top.
so, after careful study of the parts and the vehicle, i'm making this up as i go along.
a jeep i'd want to own.
unlike the suspension link bolts, the u-bolts can be torqued to their final tightening spec right now.
the raptor is a completely different vehicle (desert runner vs. rock crawler).
it bolts into existing holes.
you act as though you need two people to keep it straight going down the road and that it hops side to side when it goes over a pebble.
um, yeah.report it report it compressor says: 11:06 am, 03/19/12 smilez says: i like the versitility of a soft top, but so much more to deal with.
these parts are fairly new, and their installation isn't described in the draft set of instructions i'm working from.
last: we all want a rotary lift in our garage.
and the 2dr doesn't feel like any other car, on-road or off.
i'm sure it could be done without such a lift, but it wouldn't be easy.
but first i need to put a dab of fresh thread locking compound on the bolts.
owning a whole range of them is not cheap.
i made the steering drag link adjustment to re-center the steering wheel while you weren't looking.
so, after careful study of the parts and the vehicle, i'm making this up as i go along.
that's right; i still haven't cut or drilled anything at the rear axle.
they're destined to be replaced with longer ones, so they can go in the trash can alongside the shocks.
so i can install this spring retainer.
after 3-4 years of ownership, they may now have the money to improve their vehicle should they want.
but for those we must lift the jeep high up on the lift and retire our trusty orange floor jacks.
the brake line retaining brackets are disconnected, too, but no parts will be thrown away here.
plus, as you said $16k is nothign to sneeze at for most folks.
it's a purpose-built track car that happens to be street legal.
the real engineering and design challenge is to make it all work to high standards together.
no, the old bump stop is not in there.
it's time to install the rear half of the mopar stage 3 lift kit with fox racing shox on our 2012 jeep wrangler.
mopar later told me it's also possible to unfasten the upper end of the hose from its factory mount and reposition it with tie-wraps, but my hands wouldn't fit up in there.
on an unrelated note, all of the trailing arm bushing bolts, front and rear, get these rectangular positioning shims where they bolt to the axle.
the long spacer goes on the passenger side, where the exhaust pipe runs at a downward angle.
these brake bracket extensions drop the hoses down so they'll still work with the lifted suspension.
new upper trailing links go in next.
the rear differential breather hose (yellow) doesn't like it much, but i'll deal with that later on.
if you know what's going on, it's always easy to problem-solve.
but pushing the y-pipe back has knock-on effects farther downstream.
this concludes the driveshaft detour part of our show.
that blue tape contains a scratch mark for the next step.
the parking brake cables will still be long enough once the 3-inch mopar lift is installed, but only after i remove and discard the factory retaining bracket so they can hang down a bit more.
once the brake brackets are loose it's time to raise the lift enough to take the weight off the coil springs and open up a gap

the jeep posts are interesting, but it's a bizarre project.
the rear shocks are the component that defines how far the axle can hang, so they need to come off right away.
the girlfriend comment was just to point out that the vehicle isn't good at anything besides off-roading.
if you thought the rear installation looked easier than the front, you're right.
there's a simple trick that makes it easy: compress the shock fully on the floor, then quickly swing it into the lower bracket and let the internal gas pressure "grow" the shock into the upper mount.
and the magnitude of that shift is exactly equal to... ...the length of the short spacer, which goes on the driver side where the pipe points straight back.
i always hear this about wranglers but nobody brings up the same issue with any other ragtop.
once again their 10 bolts are to be loosened, but not removed.
technically speaking i bought fuel line hose, but it's the same size.
drive one, and take the top off, then you will get it.
this spring retainer holds the spring in place at the top, and the bolt goes into an existing hole.
and my date wouldn't be embarrassed to be seen in the comfortable pickup.
the reason people on this blog have responded the way they have is because your first post was mostly irrelevant and took an attacking tone on what is a very interesting blog post.
this is only an issue with 2012 wranglers like ours, the ones with the new pentastar v6 engine.
in the process it's costing $27k.
notice how the y-pipe's cross tube runs just ahead of the frame cross member.
the wrangler is a lot cheaper than the raptor.
the only adjustment needed is a small change in the length of the drag link to re-center the steering wheel, and that's a cosmetic adjustment that can be eyeballed.
the new ones are longer in order to keep the rear differential pinion angle at the proper angle with respect to the driveshaft.
for 27 grand, i could get a polaris side by side atv, a trailer to tow it, and a cheap, comfortable pickup to get it to the trailhead.
i have one of the best and most luxurious vehicles i've owned.
the lower end of the spring drops easily onto its seat.
and you just payed a base price of 42k to diminsh everything that makes a truck a truck.
all of the trailing arm and track bar bushings get tightened and torqued once the jeep is back down on its tires.
if you are any kind of gearhead, you will spend $20k on any vehicle you buy.

keep your eye on the urethane bump stop because it's about to disappear.
the max axxess socket set is a lot less expensive, and it works great as a regular ratchet, a deep socket alternative, as well as this particular situation.
and our rotary lift certainly helped.
notice how the y-pipe's cross tube runs just ahead of the frame cross member.
what you end up with is a vehicle that is purpose-built, has no creature comforts, and on-road it rides like a jeep.
they bolt to the forward legs of the central y-pipe in order to push it back and allow the driveshaft to clear.
anywaym, with the logic you displayed you should stick with your comfortable truck.
because of this angle, only a portion of its length contributes to a shift to the rear.
the parking brake cables will still be long enough once the 3-inch mopar lift is installed, but only after i remove and discard the factory retaining bracket so they can hang down a bit more.

the rubber spring cushion seen on the uppermost coil will be reused, but the springs are now boat anchors.

all of the trailing arm and track bar bushings get tightened and torqued once the jeep is back down on its tires.
they may end up with something that cost $27k, but many people cannot pay that all upfront.
for people that scoff at that; a) i'm not saying it will rival an a8, b) try sitting in one of these, they're amazing.
another thing we agree on: the raptor and project jeep can do amazing things.
reposition it with tie-wraps, but my hands wouldn't fit up in there.
a 3-inch suspension lift requires the driveshaft to hang down at a steeper angle.
these brake bracket extensions drop the hoses down so they'll still work with the lifted suspension.
and the new wrangler with the pentastar is pretty capable both on and off-road.
i'm sure it could be done without such a lift, but it wouldn't be easy.
incidentally, the hole i drilled made it necessary to remove one of two clips (orange) holding the abs wire in place.
this new bracket moves the left pointing point of the track bar up three inches so it will run at the same angle (nearly flat) after the three inch lift is installed.
both ends of the one on the passenger side can be bolted (loosely,) but the one of the driver side needs to hang out for a couple steps while i do something else with its rear mounting bracket.

this concludes the driveshaft detour part of our show.
one of its mounting holes (yellow) will share the bolt used to mount the link we saw in the last photo.
silicone spray helps it snap into place.
a new longer microcellular urethane bump stop will snap into the original bracket; the cup's job is to keep it lined up vertically.
lift kit: $2400 6 hours of dealer labor if they installed lift kit: $600 tires: $1166 wheels: couldn't find the price, let's assume $50 each = $200 total: almost $27000.
i really like the wheels and tires you chose.
2007-2011 jks with the older engine don't have the same exhaust routing and there's no interference.
the editors got a breaking news tip for the inside line editors?
but this way isn't wrong, it's just more time consuming.
but first i need to put a dab of fresh thread locking compound on the bolts.
the larger point is it's easy to skew to one aspect of performance when you ignore everything else.
there's a simple trick that makes it easy: compress the shock fully on the floor, then quickly swing it into the lower bracket and let the internal gas pressure "grow" the shock into the upper mount.
i'm not getting personal, it's just that your logic is seriously flawed, you have blinders on about your raptor (which is a great truck) and don't know as much about the jeep as you think.
the extra length also keeps the wheelbase from shrinking.
mopar says these lock the links into just the right position so no wheel alignment is necessary after the kit is installed.

and personally, i'd rather have a soft top cut than a widow broken, or worse yet, body damage due to an over jealous theif with a punch and screwdriver.
