all-wheel-drive is also an enabling technology to allow full optimization of the 355 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque produced by the 3.5-liter ecoboost v-6 in the mks and mkt models.that level of power in a front-wheel-drive vehicle would likely result in poor driveability and control characteristics.adding leather, awd and nicer interior materials is nothing in cost compared to the amount of money that goes into engine and chassis development, but they still charge premium prices.both realized over a decade ago, that a luxury car is more than plush seats and traction control: it is about having a true, balanced rwd platform.enough brand equity is in the name to make it worth saving.lighten up the mks, change the name to mark-s. engines would range from a turbo i4 bored out a little from fords own ecoboost so that it is unique and produces around 250hp.engines range from ecoboost 3.7 to a range topping ecoobost 5.0 with 600hp.with a mb or bimmer or even infiniti there is a look that screens out luxury & prestige.between ford’s weaker powertrain warranty (compared to gm and chrysler) and my difficulty in getting them to honor their own extended warranty, i probably would not buy a ford, though half my vehicles over the past 40 years have been ford or mercury.all they need is a rwd portfolio and a fresh design language for lincoln and audi would have an american competitor on its hands… at this point, lincoln is looking a lot like the chrysler brand of the 1990s (remember the super-k imperials and fifth avenues) and cadillac of the late 1980s and early 1990s.sure it wont be a s class competitor but it will satisfy the current market for the car (fleets, and senior citizens) and may even bring in a few from the chrysler dealers ( 300c)in terms of sales mix, the ostensible town car replacement mkt is trending at 72 percent all-wheel-drive, followed by the mkx and navigator, both at 62 percent, the mks at 46 percent, and the mkz with 25 percent.it needs its own design language to distinguish them from fords and clearly more support from ford (the company).lincoln’s biggest problem isn’t the fact that its essentially a ford add-on (same could be said about audi, lexus and buick), its the fact that ford relies way too much on tradition, rather than passion.a lot of customers want awd instead of fwd, considering the weather we have around the whole world, surely it would be more appropriate!
