even though it involved some creative driving techniques, a figure of 31.5 mpg out of a multi-ton, seven-passenger crossover is, quite simply, astonishing.
some could argue that, but not me.
audi a6 shoppers probably won't use a second mortgage to buy one, but with a starting price of $57,000 (for the 4.2-liter v8 version) you wouldn't be out of order to consider that option.
it's one of the hottest cars on the market right now.

like most diesels i've driven recently, this one performed exceptionally well.
am like so many audis (and, really, so many modern luxury cars) you can't think too carefully about the price tag when considering the new2008 s5 coupe.
interior materials, performance, high-tech features, heck even exterior styling and "presence" were all up to audi standards.
you'd think there's no getting around that 4,200-pound curb weight, but somehow the eggheads in ingolstadt have imbued the a6 with a lithe manner, even when flinging it through my favorite set of twisties.
of course it's cheaper than a $75,000 bmw 650i and quicker than that two-door as well, so maybe it's a bargain?

like every audi from this century, the a6 marries sleek exterior design with sumptuous cabin accoutrements, and places it all on a stout-yet-supple achitecture driving all four wheels (the smaller, 3.1-liter v6 can be had in front-wheel drive).
