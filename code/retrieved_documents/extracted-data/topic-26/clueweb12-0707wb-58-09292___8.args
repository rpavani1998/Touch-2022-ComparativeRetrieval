it was then towed to the nearest dealer where it took them a week to diagnose the problem and get the necessary parts from europe to fix the car.
i just got back from the dealership and it is worst..
we finally had to drive it to the dealer with the front down and leave it on to prove what was happening.
also anyone please let me know if there is change in 2012 audi q7 looks.
the car is a great vehicle to drive with all of the bells and whistles.
they state audi will not allow them to repair the mmi issue i had.
audi just makes this navigation really difficult for customers to use.
any feedback would be great.
we had trouble replicating this for the dealer as it would then correct itself when we turned the vehicle back on.
i know this might sound lame but am i the only one that finds this special destination in the nav a pain in the ass.
finally, if you are considering a 3.6 liter engine, you need to check out the resonant vibration problem that has occurred at 50 to 60 mph.
hi, i have an 09 q7 3.6 premium s line with nav for about 2 1/2 yrs now, no problem so far yet except for the poor brake noise since the beginning.
reply #668 of 668 audi escondido by 08q7 dec 02, 2011 (3:25 pm) i love, love my 2008 q7 but took it to my local dealer and after 3 weeks of them having my car.
i offered to pay the $1200 for the repair to be fixed and they declined saying they are scared i will take them to small claims..
i found that all those options aren't that useful since its better for us to look for the names because it is easier.
they have had a lot of vibration problems at speeds between 50 to 70 mph.
the issue was that the left side mmi buttons would not workwhen it rained sometimes...
the other major problem was the system that controls the height of the vehicle.

i also feel that the seal coat of the paint is soft leading to a finish that is more easily chipped with road debris..
if they did honest business they would not have to worry about smart customers...wtf??

other smaller problems include a defective assembly for the rear roof sun screen.

occasionally, when turning of the car, the from would deflate, completely lowering the front of the car while the back remained at the original height.

the car stopped in the middle of a street and would not restart.
that will st you back more that 1000 dollars at the audi dealer for the front rotors.
now none of the mmi lights work and the round thingy doesnt move anything on the screen and it is not raining.. i am livid.

i'm not certain about the q7 or what type of reliability you're looking for, but if you look at jd powers vds from2005 compared to 2011 you'll see newer vehicles across the board are much more reliable.

i am just to the point of needing new pads on the front brakes and have learned that the rotors on these cars are relatively soft and generally require replacement with each new set of pads.
such fun cars but not worth $55,000 to be treated horribly... messages page 67 of 67 search this discussion go to msg # to post a message, please sign in.
of course if you trust jd...and only care about reliability then it looks like a lincoln mkx (going by manufacturer) would be the winner.
escondido audi has ruined any enjoyment of owning an audi.
audi does not give me that option to manually spell out my destination.

i have a 2007 with the 4.2 liter engine.
that problem is well documented on this site and audi doesn't seem to have an answer #661 of 668 special destination in nav by dino2k may 10, 2011 (4:30 pm) hi, i have an 09 q7 3.6 premium s line with nav for about 2 1/2 yrs now, no problem so far yet except for the poor brake noise since the beginning.

audi's current score of 161 (which is below average) would rank higher than the 2005's ranking of honda, toyota, acura, infiniti...
so if you trust jd powers...and want the reliability of a 2005ish toyota...then the q7 would fit.
