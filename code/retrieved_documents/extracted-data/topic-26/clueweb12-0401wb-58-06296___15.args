cadillac is just more upscale in my opinion.
cadillac just seems to be a little more high-end.
they seem to be quite rewarding to drive, as well.
the new style is not only bold – a nice departure from the herd – but gets better with every new model.
caddy has done a marvelous job of reinventing itself and now makes really world-class luxury cars.
the cts-v is one of maybe 5 or 6 american cars actually worth spending hard earned money on.
lincoln seems to only know how to redesign ford grills and tail lights.
lincoln was made simply to be profitable (explained by mass sub-luxury platform sharing)
even the current dts looks great – a very nice job (though not the most up-to-date model, of course.)and.
the cts is sexy as hell, especially the coupe.
cadillac was recreated to recapture the soul of american luxury.
lincoln has a brand new mkz, mks, mkt and coming soon a refreshed mkx, which are every bit if not better than 90% of what is coming out of japan.
cadillac, way better i’m a cadillac guy, classic and modern, although i love both.
there is something about the town car’s refusal to die that makes it such an awesome reminder of what american luxury once was.
each is bred from a major automaker hoping to provide an avenue for their loyal buyers to aspire to.
lincoln’s lineup now is better organized in terms of design and mission but i would like to see at least one rwd performance based sedan and coupe.
cadillac cts makes the cadillac brand.
wow your defensive, both vehicles appeal to different demographs, and if you’ve seriously looked at the new lincolns, you’d realize what fomocofan
if they still existed today, it would be obvious who was the best.
i’m sure they are nice with ford making such a big turnaround, but i just look at them and wonder who would pay for something that looks that cheap.
i bet that you wouldnt see a similarity between the cars you mentioned if you had them in front of you.
until caddy brings out its new upcoming lineup, it can’t compete merc or bmw.
lincoln and cadillac appeal to different consumers.
but i still prefer cadillac for its performance, interior and exterior design, and its uniqueness.
when it comes to quality and luxury the winner is lincoln hands down.
cadillac definitely has pulled off the retro look much better than lincoln’s attempt.
the super-epsilon caddy flagship won’t be rwd as most wanted but in the time being if done right might be able to bring some true luxury to caddy (soft ride a la s-class and ls).
anyways, i have to say caddy, both cause i prefer cadillac, and because lincoln no longer makes lincoln.
the family oriented/non-performance luxury cars.
caddilac easily…lincoln vs. buick might get lincoln a few more votes but it’d still lose that comparison too imo.
the interior of the lincoln has a much higher quality of materials and comfort!
that being said, caddy wins this challenge by a landslide.
i do believe that lincoln is only a year or 2 from getting up there.
plus, lincoln can only get better.
cadillac has the rwd platform to it’s advantage, imho.
and it definitely shows in the products.
lincoln just makes nicer versions of ford cars.
i agree that caddillac has a more uniqueness to their vehicles, but even though lincoln is a badge engineered for, they are well done.
lexus’ may be boring, they are worlds more luxurious than any lincoln and are actually worth something when you trade them in.
definitely caddy, the cts and escalade really pushed new design.
they look the part and have the kind of engines u would pay that money for.
lincoln cars are just too much like their counterparts, nice yes, but too much like them.
i’d definitely take any lincoln over any lexus, infiniti, or honda whoops i mean acura.
lincoln seems like a new player in the luxury segment after their horrendous 90s and early 00s.
while lincoln’s are fine luxury cars, they’re still not quite up there on the level of cadillac.
lincoln makes some sharp looking cars like the mks, but lacks the sporty driving characteristics that i prefer over “soft” luxury.
cadillac is arguably the builder of more competitive luxury vehicles, but i personally like lincoln vehicles more.
right now cadillac competes with bmw, audi, and mercedes benz.
they allowed the sts and xlr to languish.
they were always ahead of lincoln; for example the fins in cadillac .
when you figure in the cost difference, lincoln, but overall, i do like lincoln better.
i know, caddy seems to be doing better, but lincoln is making a come back, one that i like more so than cadillac.
also i feel that lincoln has built higher quality cars and suv’s than cadillac for many years !
least caddillac has/had semi unique cars: cts, dts, sts, old srx.
lincoln’s classy design and abundance of tech and space suite my needs better than the bling bling of caddy but seriously, i’d pick cadillac because its not just a remake of a chevy.
i might give you the new acura’s are ugly, but they are in a completely different league of mechanics, reliability and driving experience.
thanks to thesavagepony for today’s totd.
like remdog said, i’m rooting for both and hope to see them go head-to-head one day with mb, bmw, lexus, and audi.
as he said, lincolns approach is very similar to that of audi’s, all lincoln needs is a rwd flagship for their comeback to be complete.
lincoln cars are to closely related to their ford counterparts.
i’ve liked cadillacs since they came out with the original cts and even more so with the most recent cts.
they were the first to put them in their cars and they were copied by every other luxury brand.
sit inside the mks and cts and they’re a world apart in terms of quality, functionality and fit and finish.
they have dated escalades and a fancy pants chevy equinox.
hell, the new taurus is nicer than most acuras.
they may not be fast or handle well, but they are by far one of the best rides i have ever experienced.
i think lincoln should take that old crown vic platform back out, and keep making nice american boats.
for fomoco fan….. the reason the cts is a sport sedan is because that is what everyone wants speed and lux period!
motor trend said the lincoln mkt had a better interior than an audi (you know the brand that wins the number one interior every single year).
just because they share basic, essential components does not mean they are rebadged.
lincoln definitely, lincoln is pure luxury, not a sport sedan in a luxury sedan guise like the cts.
lincoln’s are very nice cars, but i go for cadillac, why, because cadillac is produces great looking cars and is the only american luxury brand that is a huge rival towards lexus, infiniti and bmw
the lincoln’s are just ugly and ackward looking.
cadillas are the way to go, i’d never buy a lincoln (where’s the luxury?).
first of all: microsoft sync is one of the best infotainment systems out there.
only granpas want a floater like the towncar or mks that is why bmw is doing so well is they bring a full package not just a soft ride and lux!
not so long ago, cadillac wasn’t exactly thought of as competitive.
i’ve never really liked any lincolns but glad to see they seem to be turning the corner lately.
cadillac is also building high quality cars and suv’s, but cadillac also thinks they have to build high horse power high perfomance cars like the 6.2l 556 h.p.cts-v series!
so, cadillac is not the standard of the world, but by 2017 they will have a full line up of pure luxury cars.
the more personal performance luxury cars.
it’s hard to not like gm these days, when they’re putting out real driver’s cars like the g8 and cts.
then their title will remain true.
also ford and lincoln take their time to make sure they get it right on every new model they introduce!
i love the vertical tailights on the cts and other models.
until lincoln offers rear wheel drive products, v-8′s, and a 500 plus horsepower supersedan they will never be in the same league as cadillac or any other luxury car maker’s for that matter.
hey shelby- the g8 and the cts are not built on the same platform.
i saw a 75th diamond jubilee anniversary lincoln continental (it was late ’70′s), and it was an awesome looking car.
they’re still spinning their wheels and have a ways to go but starting to gain some traction.
panhard was the best, with superior enginnering, finish trim levels cadillacs were the standard of the world.
that is one of the best looking cars on the road.
it also has the option of awd, thenagain, so does cadillac, i think.
i own a mark viii which may as well be a luxo mustang cobra with automatic.
i like too much the lincoln ls, too bad was discontinued.
what that would do is only make room for improvements to the ecoboost in the future models, that way ford moco will be years ahead of the competition while gm will be at the starting line.
@coasterkidsorry, but what lincoln is doing is called platform-sharing, not rebadging.
each is bred from a major automaker hoping to provide an avenue for their loyal buyers to aspire to.
pound for pound if i was going to buy one or the other i’d buy the cadillac.
navigator i like too, but today, the products of cadillac are far better.
i would by an mks if i had the money, thats all i know.
even though they are no longer around, packard cars were the last word in luxury.
in the mainstream marketplace, cadillac once again gets respect when in competition with europe’s best (bmw, mercedes, audi).
president’s car and the biggest, most powerful american luxury brand.
however, cadillacs upcoming lineup with a true 3-series fighter would give cadillac some real depth rather than just being the cts.
but classically, i really like packards and duesenbergs.
they are trying to build american acuras as far as i can tell.
as a ford fan, i’m really pushing for lincoln.
and to me, cadillac is really the only true american luxury brand, lincoln to me is more like a premium brand that more competes with buick.
cadillac cars are so much better in terms of quality and power.
g8 is autralian, developed 7000 miles away.
and, if you’re gonna knock ecoboost, please also show me a stat or review that sees our new powertrain in a remotely bad light probably cadillac, but lincoln is not bad.
lincoln does not yet get the same amount of respect.
style is debatable, but then again, cadillac only has one car.
cadillac would say dang we should of done this a lot sooner.
however, both of these companies pale in comparison to the ultimate king of american luxury, packard.
