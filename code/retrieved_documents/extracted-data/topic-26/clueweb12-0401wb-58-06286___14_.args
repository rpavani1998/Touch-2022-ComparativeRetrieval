details such as an adjustable suspension system, different engines (a specially-tuned ecoboost v-6, perhaps), and upgraded all-wheel drive could help establish lincoln as definitively upscale in comparison with ford.this car would be v8, have all the most uptodate technology and exude refinement, reliability and be rear wheel drive also (or 4 wheel drive).make it quiet and more refined than the mustang, load it up with technogoodies and have it compete with the mb sl class at a lower price point.with this many cars in that many markets the cost of the platform would be less and would be paid off faster then is just for one market and one car.a lincoln should emit confidence and class and be unmistakable.the two brands should never see each other products, sharing platforms is going to happen obviously but get them to produce their own models from the ground up if they are their own ‘premium’ brand.a rwd larger sedán (can be smaller than a town car, but not much) is needed to mantain a beach-head in certain industries (limo/taxi/hearse…), as long as it has the latest large car engine, suspension and tranny technology.it should be luxurious, and part of being a legitimate luxury brand means having a halo vehicle and a coupe of some kind.in 2010, lincoln sales were 3.6 percent higher than in 2009.as one who sells lincoln vehicles i can say from personal experience that lincoln customers want something that sets them apart from ford customers.they are folks that work for global market companies, invest internationally, and reside in homes/condos, etc.chrome wheels and grilles can’t cure ugly, and in my opinion, they make a plain design look even cheaper, not more upscale.also would give lincoln very unique vehicles in the ford portfolio, make the dealers happy and give consumers a real reason to return to lincoln dealers.as for acura, they’ve already gobbled up the marketshare, of consumers seeking near luxury regardless of drive wheels.as someone already said on here if lincoln wants to be truly successful and set itself far ahead it has to look to be a competitor to the likes of audi and bmw in quality and engineering and not be afraid to take some pages from those companies play books!
