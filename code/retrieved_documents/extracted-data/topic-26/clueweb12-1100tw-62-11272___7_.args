due to the fact that this is a public bmw forum, bmwland cannot be held responsible for information contained within and you should not assume forum posts to be factual.the e60/1 cars i've driven have all been the basic systems and do lack, imo, and need an upgrade option.all times are utc bmwland is a bmw forum for uk owners, but is not part of bmw nor affiliated with bmw in any way.i have had the audi bose system before and that was brilliant, enough to convert me back from ipod to cd's, but the bmw setup just seems to have no depth.this bmw forum is provided as an expandable discussion library for owners and future owners of bmw cars.by k10 dbc Â» sun, 11 mar 2012 18:45:33 utc the only thing bmw have neglected is the sound system, so tinny and poor sound .i don't claim i need a top system in a car, but i've had the optional upgraded speakers, to get decent sound reproduction.bmwland does not actively monitor the contents of posted forum messages and are not responsible for any forum topic contents.please note bmwland reserves the right to remove all material from this bmw forum which we consider inappropriate.audi always have had top sound quality from day one even on my old audi 80 coupe on a d plate the sound was fantastic and never bothered to upgrade as there was need to ..my e39 had the comms pack and the sound was terrible until i fitted a sony sot amp, even then it was just passable.my e61 has good bass and reasonable quality sound, i have purchased the l7 tweeters to make it a bit better but it really isn't that bad.and i have to say that the e60 has a very poor set up for a premium car.sun, 11 mar 2012 19:36:34 utc i dont think bmw have neglected their sound system as mine sounds great and its got bass.no i agree it's poor if it's standard and not upgraded.
