very disappointed the once i turned it up a bit.
utc i would agree, terrible sound quality.
just a shame the car didn't drive that well.....
i don't claim i need a top system in a car, but i've had the optional upgraded speakers, to get decent sound reproduction.
my e39 had the comms pack and the sound was terrible until i fitted a sony sot amp, even then it was just passable.
my e61 has good bass and reasonable quality sound, i have purchased the l7 tweeters to make it a bit better but it really isn't that bad.

audi always have had top sound quality from day one even on my old audi 80 coupe on a d plate the sound was fantastic and never bothered to upgrade as there was need to ..
sun, 11 mar 2012 19:36:34 utc i dont think bmw have neglected their sound system as mine sounds great and its got bass.
falls apart and the door speakers buzz and rattle.
my 530d is perfectly fine although it does go to pot if i turn it up too loud.
utc i have no idea if mine is in any way "upgraded" from stock or not, but i came from a saab which has the worse stock system ever fitted to a motor vehicle in the history of the gramaphone!!
the e60/1 cars i've driven have all been the basic systems and do lack, imo, and need an upgrade option.
and i have to say that the e60 has a very poor set up for a premium car.
happened before here unlike the e61 the e39 included tweeters and mid range door speakers that didn't fall apart with bass and start hitting the end stops and buzzing in the doors - i'm using the same disk here (tiesto ) - and it didn't run out of puff and flat line on every bass hit at reasonable perky volumes .
i'm very critical of it sorry - probably more so as i do a lot of sound mixing work in my job.
i have had the audi bose system before and that was brilliant, enough to convert me back from ipod to cd's, but the bmw setup just seems to have no depth.

seriously, it was like having an old nokia phone on speaker and trying to listen to music, absolutely zero bass at all
no i agree it's poor if it's standard and not upgraded.

by k10 dbc » sun, 11 mar 2012 18:45:33 utc the only thing bmw have neglected is the sound system, so tinny and poor sound .
the sub's under the seat are in an excellent place, but there are loads of forums showing you what you can do for about £600 - upgrading to a proper amp, better subs and speakers generally.

i'll try to input the e39 into the newly discovered 'secret' options list finder - but by top of the range car stds e61 is just not good enough.
if played quietly it really sounds impressive to the point you want to turn it up and that impressiveness will maintain at high volume but it doesn't it turns to mud.
