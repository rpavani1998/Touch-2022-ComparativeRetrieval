the s4's performance is impressive but its price isn't.according to car & driver, when you option the bmw up to match the standard equip on the audi, then add the sport package to both cars they are within a few hundred dollars of each other, and the audi has awd (a $2k option for the bmw).the latest challenger is the 2010 s4, a newly supercharged, all-wheel drive sedan that has been realigned to better match up with bmw top 3 series four-door.it was only a few years ago when audis would give you more for your money than mbs and bmws.the "fair" comparison is not that easy; s4 may be between 335 and m3 and not necessarily a direct competitor to either.3 series, the s4 vs 335 comparison is perfectly logical and valid.latest poll gas prices are on the rise again and are expected to hit $5/gal again.this information was extracted from www.insideline.com and is subject to the terms of the visitor agreement at www.edmunds.com/help/about/visitoragreement.html.few cars have rules their class like the bmw 3 series.i can get a 335i 6mt sedan the way i want it for around $46k, which i consider pricey.a nicely equipped m3 will set u back $70 grand....but i wouldn't pay $60k for the audi or the 335 if it were that expensive.if you want to see a direct audi vs bmw m3 comparison you will have to wait until the audi rs4 debuts.however, the quattro audi just punched the rwd bimmer in the gut as validated by this comparison test.so spending the $46-60 grand puts you as well in the bmw 335i territory...so thats a bunch of pesos for the bmw as well, not only for the audi.
