we have to ask why the audi handles best and if the benz's anvil-like solidity is important.
it's this resourcefulness in combination with enduring quality that makes the 2012 bmw 328i so profoundly effective in this segment.
this is a product of the same optional s line plus package that gives the a4 the interior detailing we love.
nor does it mean it is a worse car either.

the c250 also could have benefited from the optional $1,530 dynamic handling package, which adds adjustable dampers and a variable steering ratio to the c-class, but it wasn't fitted to our test car.
also, there's the $2,550 technology package and $2,500 sport line trim.
choose either  the six-speed manual transmission — as in our tester — or the  eight-speed automatic (a $1,300 premium) and you'll get all-wheel drive as  standard equipment.
this now gives the bmw  parity with the audi a4, which increased the length of its all-wheel-drive  platform in 2009 in an effort to achieve handling dynamics more like a  rear-wheel-drive car.
he doesn't know how much power each car is putting to the ground.
and by "sporty feeling" we mean stiff, because the car's ride quality is compromised by this setup.
the bmw looks better then the audi (my opinion and the authors).

comparison 2012 audi a4 vs. 2012 bmw 328i vs. 2012 mercedes-benz c250 comparison test familiarity, contempt and the inevitable by josh jacquot, senior editor | published mar 12, 2012poor so-so pretty good good excellent it is with a keenly self-aware fear of apostasy that bmw has declined to fit its brand-defining inline-6 engine to the 2012 bmw 328i and instead has substituted a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine.
this now gives the bmw parity with the audi a4, which increased the length of its all-wheel-drive platform in 2009 in an effort to achieve handling dynamics more like a rear-wheel-drive car.
so you should know, then, that part of the reason the audi handles the best  is because it's fitted with the widest, stickiest tires wrapped around the  biggest, heaviest wheels.
hooklyn says: 10:34 am, 03/19/2012 @ mcmiskulin i was playing devils advocate.
so-so  pretty good good excellent 52 ratings comments (213)
of course, the downside to bedrock solidity is, in this case, a less  engaging driving character.
there's less athleticism in the c250 than either of the other cars, although the problem isn't so much the chassis as the powertrain.
so you should know, then, that part of the reason the audi handles the best is because it's fitted with the widest, stickiest tires wrapped around the biggest, heaviest wheels.
it's the subjective, touchy-feely  part of any comparison test that's always the hardest to assess.
the 2012 mercedes c250 is marginally more costly than the a4 at $45,900 including the premium and multimedia packages.
the bmw recorded 66.7 mph in  the slalom while the benz reached 66.2 mph, and both pulled 0.88g around the  skid pad.
the manufacturers provided edmunds these vehicles for the purposes of evaluation.
tiptronic - 6.5 to 60 2011 audi a4
and that's the case even when it's absent two historically important cylinders.
the economy/power compromise the ever-tightening noose of corporate average fuel economy (cafe) is no doubt responsible for shanghaiing two cylinders from this most established bmw model.
i am not ignoring gas mileage either because it is unfair to compare the 21.7 mpg figure for the 3,662 lb awd audi with the 23.7 mpg figure of the 3,427 lb rwd bmw...
what's more, bmw's turbocharged, direct-injected 2.0-liter inline-4 is rated at 240 horsepower and 255 pound-feet of torque, which amounts to 10 hp and 55 lb-ft more than last year's normally aspirated 3.0-liter inline-6.
the cost goes up very quickly from there — way up.
audi drive select, a $2,950 option, would have mitigated the impact of the  big wheels and tires by tuning the throttle action, steering assist and damper  action to suit different driving circumstances, but it wasn't a part of this  a4's option package.
and go to bmw and audis websites and build each of the cars.
just because they prefer the bmw to the audi doesn't mean the bmw is a better car.
it's ironic that the audi, which comes standard with all-wheel drive and provides the most sophisticated suspension configuration in the group, offers the lowest base price.
atreides says: 12:31 pm, 03/19/2012 have the germans (especially mercedes) ever addressed (read improved) their electrics issues?
i'm with church123, i'll stick w/ my g37s 6mt sedan for now.
this sense of overbuilt purpose is a kind of dna trickle-down from the small benz's larger, heavier brethren, the e-class and s-class.
we might beat you to the next stoplight with the 328i, but we wouldn't  fault you for your choice.
the mix yields a 25-mpg combined rating from the epa.
no amount of physics would explain why, given the information i presented, the gt-r would be faster than the r8.
but bmw isn't alone in introducing a four-cylinder power plant to this segment of premium sedans.
hooklyn says: 06:21 am, 03/22/2012 @ mcmiskulin
hooklyn says: 10:23 am, 03/20/2012 @ mcmiskulin i am calling them biased because that sole fact you illustrated is seemingly why it won.
the a4 is marginally  slower to 60 mph at 6.2 seconds (5.9 seconds with rollout) and is a half-second  back at the quarter-mile with an effort of 14.6 seconds at 94.1 mph.
if you're of average build, you'll have no trouble finding room in the back of the benz.
that is bmw's fault, not audis.
the 2012 audi a4 has embraced four-cylinder power since the 1997 model, although this 2012 iteration utilizes turbocharging and direct fuel injection to produce 211 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque from a 2.0-liter four.
all it does better, according to this test, is get to 60mph and through the 1/4 5% faster.
fact is that both cars are 100% equipped meaning the bmw doesn't come with high performance 19" wheels/tires.
i guess it doesn't matter.
we'll make this simple: when  it comes to drag racing, the right physics will win.
it's this resourcefulness in combination with  enduring quality that makes the 2012 bmw 328i so profoundly effective in this  segment.
the new electrically assisted steering isn't communicative on a granular level, but it isn't going to repel anyone either.

as if people only buy these cars for their 0-60 time.
objective handling tests, though, fall largely in favor of the audi, which  has the quickest slalom speed at 69.2 mph and best lateral acceleration at  0.92g.
the 2012 mercedes c250 is marginally more costly than the a4 at $45,900  including the premium and multimedia packages.
and so does the 328i.
these are all very good cars.

regardless, what we have here are three entry-level luxury sedans with base prices all starting at about $35,000.
just a hair over $43k.
after two weeks, hundreds of miles of side-by-side driving and one day of track testing, a clear winner had yet to emerge.
for some reason , i'm not really even interested in test driving them , either.
of course things like gearing, and drivetrain loss, and what have you will effect it but my point is that church doesn't know that information either.
the automatic transmission is slow to respond and no complement to  the least powerful engine in this group.
and that's the case even when it's absent two historically important  cylinders.
the audi's superior grip showed itself again in our braking test, where it stopped from 60 mph in only 108 feet.
meanwhile, the 328i included driving dynamics control, bmw's own electronic overseer of throttle, steering and damping, and the optional adjustable dampers of the adaptive m suspension certainly helped this 3 series be all things to all people.
i'm happy w/ 21mpg mixed and solid reliability.
this sea change aligns the entry-level version of the 3 series with its  four-cylinder competitors, the 2012 audi a4 and 2012 mercedes-benz c250.
the benz, hampered by its automatic transmission off the line, is slowest.
the audi's superior grip showed itself again in our braking test, where it  stopped from 60 mph in only 108 feet.
still, we could option this car with more restraint and keep it competitive with the a4 and c250, and yet still lop nearly $6 grand from its sticker price.
$50,000 is the new $40,000 it is perhaps a sign of more than simple inflation that we can remember when coughing up $15,000 for an audi 4000 seemed outrageous.
it's the subjective, touchy-feely part of any comparison test that's always the hardest to assess.
the a4, which is the most controlled car here when tossed around, is downright snappy by comparison.
even with the advantage of  all-wheel drive during the launch, the a4 couldn't hold its edge in getaway  quickness all the way to 60 mph.
the bmw recorded 66.7 mph in the slalom while the benz reached 66.2 mph, and both pulled 0.88g around the skid pad.
(an  eight-speed automatic is a zero-cost option unless you opt for paddle shifters,  which add $475.)
the c250 also could have benefited from the optional  $1,530 dynamic handling package, which adds adjustable dampers and a variable  steering ratio to the c-class, but it wasn't fitted to our test car.
of course, you can forget about adjustments in cornering attitude from the chassis when you're in the middle of the corner, but these matter less when the other cars are already dots in the rearview mirror.

audi a4 mt - 6.3 to 60 2011 audi a4
both completely subjective.
after all, here we've got an audi that's clearly the bmw's better when it  comes to measured evaluations of handling, while the distinctly well-built  mercedes-benz strikes an attractive balance between efficiency and luxury.
i just always remember the germans as not having the best electrical systems in their cars...
but just as most others have noted in their comments on this comparo..
and from audi's website, also conservative.
we already argued interior space and the bmw literally has 0.2 cu.ft more interior volume.
it also packs big-dollar options.
the bmw is bigger inside.
also, the benz offers the least headroom in the group by about a half inch.
so we drove on, dug deep into our quiver of hair-splitting tools and began to tally the notes.
choose either the six-speed manual transmission — as in our tester — or the eight-speed automatic (a $1,300 premium) and you'll get all-wheel drive as standard equipment.
the benz,  hampered by its automatic transmission off the line, is slowest.
my 2000 bmw 323 was epa rated at 21/26 and i got 26-27 combined all of the time and almost 30 on trips that were all highway.
the c250's 24.7 mpg came during 680 miles of mixed  driving, but the 328i wasn't far behind at 23.6 mpg over 1,455 miles.
if we lived in  colorado, we'd buy the 2012 audi a4 and ditch the 19-inch wheels and tires in  favor of a choice with lighter wheels and better-riding rubber.
objective handling tests, though, fall largely in favor of the audi, which has the quickest slalom speed at 69.2 mph and best lateral acceleration at 0.92g.
$50,000 is the new $40,000 it is perhaps a sign of  more than simple inflation that we can remember when coughing up $15,000 for an  audi 4000 seemed outrageous.
my current car is rated at 16/24 and i get 22-23 in very spirited mostly city driving.
you said i ignore the facts yet everything you just mentioned were opinions??
audi drive select, a $2,950 option, would have mitigated the impact of the big wheels and tires by tuning the throttle action, steering assist and damper action to suit different driving circumstances, but it wasn't a part of this a4's option package.
subjectively i have a preference as well... pathos says: 10:26 pm, 03/19/2012 atreides says: 12:31 pm, 03/19/2012 have the germans (especially mercedes) ever addressed (read improved) their electrics issues?
although the c-class lacks the cruise-missile speed of those bigger cars, it delivers the same carefully controlled body motions when you're behind the wheel.
at 3,427 pounds the bmw is 98 pounds lighter than the c250 and 235 pounds  lighter than the a4.
audi a4 (manual) 0-60 mph 6.3 2011 audi a4
thanks to its options-gone-wild approach, this bmw 328i punches through the  $50,000 barrier, which isn't something we take lightly in this segment.
regardless, what we have here are three  entry-level luxury sedans with base prices all starting at about $35,000.
a continuously variable transmission (cvt) is available in  front-drive models only.
no matter where we drove the bmw, we liked the experience, even if the car might have lacked a little something compared to either the audi or mercedes.
and from mt just last month; a4 - 5.8 to 60 and 14.4 1/4 328i - 5.6 to 60 and 14.2 1/4 and also from that test, for those of you who complained about the 19" wheels/tires bmw doesn't offer, as if that is audis fault for doing so and for thousands less too; a4 with 18" wheels/tires - 0.91 g and 25.9 sec.
it says: 12:19 pm, 03/19/2012 based on what i've been reading and my autoshow experiences none of the present offerings of these big 3 german marks are appealing.
of course, you can forget about adjustments in cornering attitude from the  chassis when you're in the middle of the corner, but these matter less when the  other cars are already dots in the rearview mirror.
audi's a4 is the next most expensive car here, although its $45,675 bottom  line is $5,070 less costly than the bimmer.
i just always remember the germans as not having the best electrical systems in their cars... -------------------------------------------------------------------
the audi was better in every single other way.
our  tester was fitted with the standard six-speed manual transmission.
so equipped, the bmw 328i would still offer the ability to morph between agreeable freeway cruiser, efficient commuter and reasonably capable back-road companion better than its competition.
he doesn't know the gear ratios of each cars transmission, etc.
the bmw was faster than the audi.
there's less athleticism in the c250 than either of  the other cars, although the problem isn't so much the chassis as the  powertrain.
the 2012 mercedes-benz c250 has a wheelbase of 108.7 inches, and while the  1.9-inch difference hardly makes this car small, it does translate into about  an inch less rear legroom.
the mix yields a 25-mpg combined rating  from the epa.
accelerate, turn nobody is buying the four-cylinder version of these cars for drag racing, but there's a reason you skipped directly to this section of the copy, isn't there?
the 2012 audi a4 has embraced four-cylinder power since the 1997 model,  although this 2012 iteration utilizes turbocharging and direct fuel injection  to produce 211 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque from a 2.0-liter four.
or perhaps you're a sucker for the well-built refinement of the 2012 mercedes-benz c250, and we wouldn't fault you for your choice even if we might beat you to the next stoplight in the bmw.
all-weather ability, for example, might be necessary.
the bmw rides better then the audi.
bmw's fear is justified.
combine these stats with a power advantage and the bmw is easily the quickest car here in a straight line.
3rd place: 2012 mercedes-benz c250less capable as a driver's car, but bedrock-solid build quality and trickle-down driving character from its larger siblings make the c250 a solid choice.
multitronic- 7.0 to 60 and, for 2012 audi replaced the 6-speed tiptronic with an 8-speed unit...
so i'll wait until i can drive mine to see what it really does.
the interior provides the same familiar feel of a recent-generation 3 series with a touch of updating, and to our eyes the exterior styling easily makes it the best-looking car here.
the new electrically assisted steering isn't  communicative on a granular level, but it isn't going to repel anyone either.
but if your vertical dimension pushes the 6-foot mark, the missing inch will make a difference on longer trips.
plus which is only an option on the top-spec prestige trim you save even more money over the 328i.
a continuously variable transmission (cvt) is available in front-drive models only.
the a4 is decidedly the most sporty-feeling sedan in the group as a result.
the 2012 mercedes-benz c250 has a wheelbase of 108.7 inches, and while the 1.9-inch difference hardly makes this car small, it does translate into about an inch less rear legroom.
(an eight-speed automatic is a zero-cost option unless you opt for paddle shifters, which add $475.)
and did you just see how bmw lowered the epa ratings for the 328i just yesterday...
the audi should have won.
as different as the bmw and mercedes-benz might seem in concept, the 328i and c250 were much the same in these tests.
so  we drove on, dug deep into our quiver of hair-splitting tools and began to  tally the notes.
2nd place: 2012 audi a4standout handling, interior quality and an awd powertrain make the a4 unique, but they don't make it better than the 328i.
and the audi still costs $5k less with the higher performance 19" wheels/tires and the addition of awd with comparable equipment/features.
although the c-class lacks  the cruise-missile speed of those bigger cars, it delivers the same carefully  controlled body motions when you're behind the wheel.
character counts perhaps the most defining trait of the mercedes-benz c250 is the simple, honest way it goes about every task.
the benz also wins the  timeless contest in door-slam quality with a heavily damped thud that sounds  like play doh landing on bedrock.
the c250's 24.7 mpg came during 680 miles of mixed driving, but the 328i wasn't far behind at 23.6 mpg over 1,455 miles.
i want it progressive ,direct, and adjustable w/ my right foot and hands.
in fact, this entry-level 3  series has been equipped as a showcase of bmw options, so our 328i tester tips  the scales at a wage-crushing $50,745.
the benz approach to this four is  similar in concept to bmw, and this turbocharged, direct-injected 1.8-liter  inline-4 cranks out 201 hp and 229 lb-ft of torque.
the economy/power compromise the ever-tightening  noose of corporate average fuel economy (cafe) is no doubt responsible for  shanghaiing two cylinders from this most established bmw model.
it handles better, brakes better, has a nicer interior (so says i/l), has equal or more features, and costs $5k+ less with the addition of awd.
no matter where we drove the bmw, we liked the experience, even if  the car might have lacked a little something compared to either the audi or  mercedes.
after two weeks,  hundreds of miles of side-by-side driving and one day of track testing, a clear  winner had yet to emerge.
we'll make this simple: when it comes to drag racing, the right physics will win.
the automatic transmission is slow to respond and no complement to the least powerful engine in this group.
a downshift, which requires a lateral slap of the shift lever on the console, slurs between gears with a throttle blip that's only marginally effective in speeding the process.
but if your vertical dimension pushes the  6-foot mark, the missing inch will make a difference on longer trips.
there's less body roll, speedy response from  the steering wheel and the most trusted and effective brake pedal in the group.
of course, the downside to bedrock solidity is, in this case, a less engaging driving character.
the 2012 mercedes-benz c250 is an all-new model  created specifically to sip fuel in the most cost-effective way possible, even  while surrounding its occupants in luxury.

this information was extracted from www.insideline.com and is subject to the terms of the visitor agreement at www.edmunds.com/help/about/visitoragreement.html.
only one transmission is available: a seven-speed automatic.
also, since early dyno testing of the bmw show it's hp to be understated, it makes it less likely that bmw would lie about the epa numbers.
you guys take this crap as if what i/l says matters.
the new 2012 bmw 328i wasn't walking away from its  competition, as have so many 3 series models in pastinside line comparison tests.
at 3,427 pounds the bmw is 98 pounds lighter than the c250 and 235 pounds lighter than the a4.
six-speed shift-it-yourself a4s — like our test car — are rated at 25 mpg epa combined.
place: 2012 bmw 328ithe most powerful and best all-around driving car here, the 328i also offers a sublime mix of efficiency and luxury.
i also drive a lot faster than the epa (who don;t exceed 60 mph per their website).
for me , the older i get , it seems, i want less of the "features" - i don't want adaptable anything -steering, throttle response, dampening.
the 2011 audis should have the same times as the 2012.
and by "sporty  feeling" we mean stiff, because the car's ride quality is compromised by  this setup.
the winner that we're giving the win in this contest  to the 2012 bmw 328i is a product of its do-all abilities.
truth is, you won't go wrong with any of these cars.
the return is there, however, with epa numbers offering a 5-mpg increase in combined fuel economy for the turbo-4 versus a normally aspirated inline-6 (27 mpg vs. 22 mpg).
the cost  goes up very quickly from there — way up.

there's less body roll, speedy response from the steering wheel and the most trusted and effective brake pedal in the group.
haha http://www.leftlanenews.com/epa-lowers-bmws-claimed-2436mpg-rating-for-2012-328i-by-several-mpgs.html
the victory, though, comes with the caveat that your needs might demand other priorities better served by the supremely good audi or benz.
but don't mistake these base prices for what you'll actually pay.
even with the advantage of all-wheel drive during the launch, the a4 couldn't hold its edge in getaway quickness all the way to 60 mph.
if you note, the 5.5 time of the bmw is .8 sec.
but in  light of bmw's rich tradition of inline-6 engines and its loyal following of  customers, is this new four-cylinder really progress?

maybe the ats will be the answer, time will tell.
but in light of bmw's rich tradition of inline-6 engines and its loyal following of customers, is this new four-cylinder really progress?
like i said, we'll have to see.
just the fact that the 3 series 6 speed manual trans now gets better economy than the 8 speed auto is suspicous no matter what you think of the bmw.
pathos says: 10:24 pm, 03/19/2012 hooklyn, get a live girlfriend and you might find that you are posting less.
the a4 is decidedly  the most sporty-feeling sedan in the group as a result.
this  sense of overbuilt purpose is a kind of dna trickle-down from the small benz's  larger, heavier brethren, the e-class and s-class.
i know which car is objectively better and after all of this info you should too.
when it comes to the interface for the cabin's electronic comfort and  convenience features, the audi gives up its leadership, as mmi is awkward to  use relative to both bmw's idrive and mercedes' comand systems.
with 18" wheels/tires - 0.90 g and 25.9 sec.
the return is  there, however, with epa numbers offering a 5-mpg increase in combined fuel  economy for the turbo-4 versus a normally aspirated inline-6 (27 mpg vs. 22  mpg).
it won't surprise anyone to know that the slowest car in the group earns the best fuel economy.
the new 2012 bmw 328i wasn't walking away from its competition, as have so many 3 series models in pastinside line comparison tests.
six-speed shift-it-yourself a4s — like our test  car — are rated at 25 mpg epa combined.
figure-8 and; a4 quattro as tested mileage - 16.6mpg 328i rwd as tested mileage - 16.8mpg rwd and that audi was almost $7,500 cheaper in that test.
the costliest is the $9,500 prestige package, which hits home with goodies like mmi navigation, the convenience package, heated front seats and a bang & olufsen premium audio system.
only one transmission is  available: a seven-speed automatic.
so  equipped, the bmw 328i would still offer the ability to morph between agreeable  freeway cruiser, efficient commuter and reasonably capable back-road companion  better than its competition.
mcmiskulin says: 12:49 pm, 03/19/2012 @hooklyn these are the 0-60 times taken from another website that collects 0-60 tiems from other reviews.

the winner that we're giving the win in this contest to the 2012 bmw 328i is a product of its do-all abilities.
at 21.6 mpg over 684 miles, the all-wheel-drive audi isn't as miserly.
the bmw doesn't inspire you to attack any back roads, but it offers a prudent degree of mountain-road-handling prowess to complement bmw's classic formula for all-around success.
but the best interior in this group is not determined by space alone.
if you're of average build, you'll have no trouble  finding room in the back of the benz.
there are also brushed aluminum inlays and a black cloth headliner.
i know that the epa testing isn't for shit
the bmw won because it is a bmw.
after all, here we've got an audi that's clearly the bmw's better when it comes to measured evaluations of handling, while the distinctly well-built mercedes-benz strikes an attractive balance between efficiency and luxury.
the manufacturers provided edmunds these vehicles for the purposes of  evaluation.
what's more, bmw's turbocharged, direct-injected 2.0-liter inline-4 is  rated at 240 horsepower and 255 pound-feet of torque, which amounts to 10 hp  and 55 lb-ft more than last year's normally aspirated 3.0-liter inline-6.
as different as the bmw and mercedes-benz might seem in concept, the  328i and c250 were much the same in these tests.
the bmw doesn't inspire you to attack any back roads, but it offers a  prudent degree of mountain-road-handling prowess to complement bmw's classic  formula for all-around success.
and i am not going to argue the gas mileage of a 3,600lb awd car to a 3,400lb rwd car.
the a4 is marginally slower to 60 mph at 6.2 seconds (5.9 seconds with rollout) and is a half-second back at the quarter-mile with an effort of 14.6 seconds at 94.1 mph.
even the bmw website (which is conservative both on 0-60 times and hp) shows the manual at 5.7.
the c250 and 328i recorded stops only 4  feet and 7 feet longer, respectively.
sixty mph  arrives in 7.3 seconds (6.9 seconds with rollout) with all 1,320 feet passing  in 15.3 seconds at 90.7 mph.
the 2012 bmw 328i sweeps both straight-line tests by hitting 60 mph in 5.9  seconds (5.5 seconds using a1-foot rollout like on a drag strip) and passing  through the quarter-mile in 14.1 seconds at 98.9 mph.
of course this fee includes some stupendous options, the most costly of which is the $3,600 premium package.
by our estimation, the honor falls squarely to the audi.
the benz also wins the timeless contest in door-slam quality with a heavily damped thud that sounds like play doh landing on bedrock.
the benz approach to this four is similar in concept to bmw, and this turbocharged, direct-injected 1.8-liter inline-4 cranks out 201 hp and 229 lb-ft of torque.
all three  systems integrate navigation, phone and audio controls into a menu-based  knob-and-button interface, but audi's system is less elegant and integrated in  its design than the others.
in fact, this entry-level 3 series has been equipped as a showcase of bmw options, so our 328i tester tips the scales at a wage-crushing $50,745.
the costliest is the $9,500 prestige package, which hits home with goodies like  mmi navigation, the convenience package, heated front seats and a bang &  olufsen premium audio system.
see a coincidence in the numbers you posted...hehe 2011

such details ultimately define a car's character and  then earn brand loyalty.
most of the public knows their consumer report reliability rankings, but they keep gobbling them up.
or perhaps  you're a sucker for the well-built refinement of the 2012 mercedes-benz c250,  and we wouldn't fault you for your choice even if we might beat you to the next  stoplight in the bmw.
the 2012 mercedes-benz c250 is an all-new model created specifically to sip fuel in the most cost-effective way possible, even while surrounding its occupants in luxury.
the 2012 bmw 328i sweeps both straight-line tests by hitting 60 mph in 5.9 seconds (5.5 seconds using a1-foot rollout like on a drag strip) and passing through the quarter-mile in 14.1 seconds at 98.9 mph.
still,  we could option this car with more restraint and keep it competitive with the  a4 and c250, and yet still lop nearly $6 grand from its sticker price.
we think they're important.
by  our estimation, the honor falls squarely to the audi.
it's  ironic that the audi, which comes standard with all-wheel drive and provides  the most sophisticated suspension configuration in the group, offers the lowest  base price.
all three systems integrate navigation, phone and audio controls into a menu-based knob-and-button interface, but audi's system is less elegant and integrated in its design than the others.
and that is still including awd on the audi the whole time too... $40k a4 > $40k 328i $40k a4 =
the a4, which is the most controlled car here when tossed around, is  downright snappy by comparison.
it won't surprise anyone to know that the slowest car in the group earns  the best fuel economy.
but bmw isn't alone in introducing a four-cylinder power plant to this  segment of premium sedans.
i am not ignoring audis wheel/tire setup.
sixty mph arrives in 7.3 seconds (6.9 seconds with rollout) with all 1,320 feet passing in 15.3 seconds at 90.7 mph.
credit for this  accomplishment goes to the s line plus option package, which adds faux suede to  the a4's standard leather on most critical seating surfaces.
if we lived in colorado, we'd buy the 2012 audi a4 and ditch the 19-inch wheels and tires in favor of a choice with lighter wheels and better-riding rubber.
also, the  benz offers the least headroom in the group by about a half inch.
at 21.6  mpg over 684 miles, the all-wheel-drive audi isn't as miserly.
i've owned examples of all 3 marks in the past, but they have seemed to have lost their way.
this is a product of the same optional s line plus  package that gives the a4 the interior detailing we love.
credit for this accomplishment goes to the s line plus option package, which adds faux suede to the a4's standard leather on most critical seating surfaces.
accelerate, turn nobody is buying the four-cylinder  version of these cars for drag racing, but there's a reason you skipped  directly to this section of the copy, isn't there?
such details ultimately define a car's character and then earn brand loyalty.
and it costs $5k more in doing so.
dollar-for-dollar, the bmw cannot nearly compare to the audi for features and equipment.
when it comes to the interface for the cabin's electronic comfort and convenience features, the audi gives up its leadership, as mmi is awkward to use relative to both bmw's idrive and mercedes' comand systems.
faster than that of the audi and is the same time that i have seen in just about every other review.
audi's a4 is the next most expensive car here, although its $45,675 bottom line is $5,070 less costly than the bimmer.
they have biases too.
more than we do because they actually get paid to do this.
of course this fee includes some  stupendous options, the most costly of which is the $3,600 premium package.
the victory, though,  comes with the caveat that your needs might demand other priorities better  served by the supremely good audi or benz.
combine these stats with a power advantage and the bmw is  easily the quickest car here in a straight line.
the c250 and 328i recorded stops only 4 feet and 7 feet longer, respectively.
the interior provides the same familiar feel of a recent-generation 3 series  with a touch of updating, and to our eyes the exterior styling easily makes it  the best-looking car here.
it is with a keenly self-aware fear of apostasy that bmw has declined to  fit its brand-defining inline-6 engine to the 2012 bmw 328i and instead has  substituted a turbocharged, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine.
sort by:most recent first posted advertisement speed read 1st
there are also  brushed aluminum inlays and a black cloth headliner.
even when you limit the options on the bmw to match the audi's price, the bmw is still the better all around car.
and secondly, you say the bmw won because it is a better car.
so inside line comes up with a record breaking time for the audi but is very slow with the bmw and you are calling them biased towards the bmw??
