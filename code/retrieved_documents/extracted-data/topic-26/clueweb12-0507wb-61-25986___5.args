both diesel and gas engines covert fuel into energy through a series of small combustions.
this allows for the recycling of used oils which is also good for the environment.
in a diesel engine, the air is compressed first and then the fuel is injected.

biodiesel is a non-fossil fuel alternative to petro-diesel that can be used in diesel engines, without needing to modify the engine.
diesel powered vehicles not only have better fuel economy than gasoline engines, they also produce lessgreenhouse gas emissions.
the major difference between diesel and gas is the way these combustions happen.
in a diesel engine, the air is compressed first and then the fuel is injected.
even used cooking oil from restaurants can be can be used although it needs to be cleaned first.
the catalyst is basically a filter that traps offensive emissions.
this allows for the recycling of used oils which is also good for the environment.
periodically, the engine will switch to an air-fuel mixture that will burn off the material in the traps.
the major difference between diesel and gas is the way these combustions happen.
it has an adjustable suspension and an off-road mode that make it great for rough terrain.
diesel powered vehicles not only have better fuel economy than gasoline engines, they also produce lessgreenhouse gas emissions.
in a gas engine, fuel is mixed with air, compressed by pistons and ignited by sparks from the spark plugs.
when crude oil is refined, it can be made into many different types of fuel such as kerosene, gasoline and diesel.
because air heats up when it’s compressed, the fuel ignites.
even used cooking oil from restaurants can be can be used although it needs to be cleaned first.
biodiesel is a non-fossil fuel alternative to petro-diesel that can be used in diesel engines, without needing to modify the engine.
higher diesel prices reflect demand.
it also reduces emissions, it’s biodegradable, it’s safer to transport and handle and reduces dependence on foreign oil.
