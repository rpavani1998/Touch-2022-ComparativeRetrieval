according to all the reviews i found, reliability is average, and customer satisfaction with the a3 is outstanding.
cost cutting and no concern for the history of the brand is destroying the german car market.
replaced the worn out front suspension, eibach springs, koni shocks.
the only problem i had was with the compressor on my 1993 90cs, with my 1999 a6 no trouble at all and now with my 2001 a8l i just drive and drive.
my only true complaint with audi is the sound and navigation systems.
we have lots of traffic here in southern florida and i just am smitten with the way this tranny performs... .2 second shifts up or down, rpm blipping, and a couple different shifting patterns with properly-placed paddles.
i consider myself a well liked , knowledgeable salesperson with a great client base .
when i meet a new - potential customer for the first time i take pains in pointing out both the good and bad of german cars .
our first audi was a '98 a6 wagon with almost 170,000 miles on it.
audi removed most of the great features to make it a vanilla sports car.

i would take an r8,tdi, even with all its(socalled) problems ,im retired, and got time on my hands,r8,tdi ohhyeah!!
seabreez: i am a 2008 tt owner also, a 2.0 turbo roadster, and would not purchase anything but the s-tronic transmission.
the other was a 5000s diesel back in the days when diesel was a big pain.

the cars have always been the best option when you are looking for something a little more comfortable and unique over other german brands.
in fact, my opinion of the other two major german builders, mb and bmw, has diminished with my also having reliability issues with each model i have owned.
my experience owning cars by these japanese makers has been excellent.
my second audi is a 2006 a6 for the wife, with 38,000 miles on it and nary a problem in that time period.
and as far as navigation, audi's is twice as good as the navigation in my 2003 clk convertible.
all cars in fact have significantly improved their vehicles in terms of quality.
pity, as i've recently started thinking about which audi to get next... ms.m new user | posts: 1 | joined: 01/08 posted: 01/17/08 02:57 pm i am having a hard time believing these post are actual audi customers.
although i am a tt owner, i can tell you that i will never purchase an automatic tt (s-tronic) they are trying to push here in the usa.
i enjoy driving the german cars , i prefer owning the japenese cars .
these cars are built to last 400-500,000 miles

i already flashed the ecu(apr)and added a neuspeed cold air intake with a metallic blitz filter.
my fear regarding the quality issues of german cars is that they  will not improve but in fact may get worse as our dollar continues to fall .

i leased the car as a project car and plan to do other upgrades to bring hp levels into the 325 to 350 range... easy to do on this engine.

the german mystic is, in my opinion, simply good advertising.

what i want in a high-end car is to be able to drive it each day and not simply wait for the shop to repair it.
we put eibach springs ans struts on it, and 17" s6 5-spoke alloys.
they have been reiable, comfortable and outstanding perfomers.

it is a shame because they have always served my family well and the cars have become the new benchmark with many others trying to keep up.
compared to japan, they are an embarrassment.
i too have had two audi's,one of which was the first tt.
audi was unfailingly ready to fix things (totally replaced the dash, the sound system, the transmission, and the heating/cooling system, and always provided a lovely audi to drive while mine was being fixed) but it got old.

i heard about audi reliability problems ten years ago and now alot of bmw's and mercedes having them too.
i guess you know that in the rest of the civilized world, the a3 is available with bluetec, which gets well over 50 mpg.

i have owned three audis and have not had overwhelming trouble with any of them.
in terms of build quality i will always think german engineers are top notch.
i am not there "just to sell" i am there to promote the products that i represent and to build relationships with my customer base .
they have been reiable, comfortable and outstanding perfomers.
so all you detractors of the brand, put that in your bong and smoke it.

in the lighting department, i changed out the clear drl's and put in amber bulbs and my fog lights are now hid.
my family - including my parents have been long term audi owners with an occasional cadillac and bmw.
in closing, i would state that i have had some nice rides in the past, i'm 57 years young, and i never received the attention and positive unsolicited responses that the new tt garners from people of all ages and walks of life.

i believe many of these so called audi owners are nothing more than goonies that are paid to create negative rumors and fear about audi.

except for the '74 100ls and '85 gt, all have been exceptionally reliable.

i had a 2002 a4, and the only problem was the faulty ignition coils, which was handled in fine style by my dealership, in conjunction with audi.
but they are better that all other german cars .
the last was an a6 i had for 4 years.
soon,they will be buying korean built 'german cars',rebadging them and selling them worldwide as german.
they will drive the customers to the japanese makes.
buy a benz or audi that's 5 years old and you can find one under $10k.
i adored the tt in spite of the four tows that were required in the two years i had the car, but i finally got tired of being stranded on the road.

we have had mild issues with most of the vehicles but nothing out of the ordinary and the audis tend to have fewer major issues and fewer visits to the shop.

thanks for the site, it's a great one.
the cost of a quality german luxury sedan is much too high when compared to the prices asked by acura, infiniti and lexus.
i am not there "just to sell" i am there to promote the products that i represent and to build relationships with my customer base .
there is hardly any new car in a showroom that matches this car for luxury, performance, and understated elegance.
the car gets 25 to 30 mpg and is a technical and design tour de force.
pity, as i've recently started thinking about which audi to get next... i am having a hard time believing these post are actual audi customers.
and i saw a good interview with an audi brand specialist that explains a lot about the r8 and it's design and build ( www.wsw.com/show ).
i have heard that about two years ago sales fell off and audi hired a daimler-chrysler person to improve quality.

my next upgrade will come shortly; a downpipe and catback glh twin-tipped dual exhausts and a stage two ecu flash, good for another 25 hp.

i think being informative is an important part of my job .
once again, this is an excellent example of audi not understanding their market here in the usa.
as nearly as i can determine, about every 3rd audi has lots of problems.
although on paper the body designs, engine specs and interior ambiance really appeals to me, the extremely poor reliability of these machines keep me from even considering them again for purchase.
my experience owning cars by these japanese makers has been excellent.
i fervently hope that it's problem-free (don't we all), and i believe that it will be or i wouldn't have bought it, but we will see.
awesome car, as solid as a tenk, and never a problem.
except for the '74 100ls and '85 gt, all have been exceptionally reliable.
every car maker puts out the occasional lemon, but i've yet to own or drive a german automobile that registered a complaint for me, and that includes audi's a6.
