they come from humble origins which is partly why the reliability may have been inferior in the past and scarred some people.the e90 is ugly, and though the 335i has a fantastic engine, it has still diminished in road feel.i also own a mercedes and a bmw and the mercedes is very reliable as is the bmw, but the bmw can be expensive to repair at times, but nothing to match the audi.it is almost totally unreliable and the dealer is a liar and a thief.maintaining a german car is never cheap, but owning one can be worth well worth it.i know the history of audi and understand that in the past they were rally cars, much like the wrx and evo of back in the day and not considered a pristigious brand.the ones i've spoken to all love their audis and praise the quality and reliability.our other vehicles are acuras (a 2006 rl and a 2003 mdx with 150,000 miles) and they, too, have been virtually trouble-free though they are not as entertaining to drive as the audis.why, because we think bigger is better, or the guys and women that drive them must feel inadequate and require a large vehicle to make them feel better.i have spent almost $5,000 in repairs (right front and left rear corners replaced, for instance)since the warranty ran out two years ago and i will never own another audi.they moved towards hardcore luxury with a hint of performance instead of their bread and butter e36 chassis performance that was worthy of the ultimate driving machine designation.the dealers kept deflecting diagnosis of the defective instrument panel Â chip which caused a myriad of problems until they wore me out and i paid for the replacement myself.the dealers kept deflecting diagnosis of the defective instrument panel chip which caused a myriad of problems until they wore me out and i paid for the replacement myself.it's the same as a porshe cyenne only bigger, better fuel economy, more practical, and not as stuffy.the quality of our two audis has been fine.
