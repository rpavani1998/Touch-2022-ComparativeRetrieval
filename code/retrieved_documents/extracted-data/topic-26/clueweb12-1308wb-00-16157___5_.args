it has better body control than any of its rivals and feels sure-footed in corners.list prices undercut a 3-series, insurance ratings are competitive, retained values are impressive and fuel economy strong (although the exceptional bmw beats it on this score).the most popular engine is likely to be the 2.0-litre tdi, and it too has an impressive range of abilities.ergonomically, it’s superb, and there’s lots of steering wheel and seat adjustment, plus ample stowage space.natural rivals are the bmw 3-series and mercedes c-class; these german models dominate the compact executive saloon sector, but rejuvenated ‘mainstream’ machinery such as the ford mondeo and mazda 6 will also claim to be good-value alternatives.it is a fantastic car to live with on a daily basis and i think it is a wonderful vehicle on the motorway.the layout, quality and feel of the cabin, which features the same dash as the a5, is smarter than any rival’s.the saloon shares front-end styling with the a5 coupe, and its sharp lines have a taut, strong look.other engines include an impressive 1.8-litre turbo petrol, plus v6 diesel and petrol powerplants.the steering is sharp and the turn-in positive, and while it isn’t as dynamic as a 3-series, it’s far more composed than a mercedes.power arrives quickly, is delivered smoothly and it’s also quiet and refined, too.an electronic parking brake and multi media interface screen, first seen in the a6 and a8, are fitted as standard.the newcomer has a distinctively sporting appearance, but it’s still unmistakable – not just as an audi, but as an a4.the audi strikes a good balance when it comes to ride quality, too.small trim line-up, not quite as economical as a 3-series driving dynamically, the latest a4 is a revelation.
