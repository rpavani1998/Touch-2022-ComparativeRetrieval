just because they share basic, essential components does not mean they are rebadged.each is bred from a major automaker hoping to provide an avenue for their loyal buyers to aspire to.cadillac cars are so much better in terms of quality and power.in the mainstream marketplace, cadillac once again gets respect when in competition with europe’s best (bmw, mercedes, audi).caddy has done a marvelous job of reinventing itself and now makes really world-class luxury cars.the interior of the lincoln has a much higher quality of materials and comfort!there is something about the town car’s refusal to die that makes it such an awesome reminder of what american luxury once was.lincoln and cadillac appeal to different consumers.however, both of these companies pale in comparison to the ultimate king of american luxury, packard.the new style is not only bold – a nice departure from the herd – but gets better with every new model.but i still prefer cadillac for its performance, interior and exterior design, and its uniqueness.they were the first to put them in their cars and they were copied by every other luxury brand.as he said, lincolns approach is very similar to that of audi’s, all lincoln needs is a rwd flagship for their comeback to be complete.motor trend said the lincoln mkt had a better interior than an audi (you know the brand that wins the number one interior every single year).they look the part and have the kind of engines u would pay that money for.
