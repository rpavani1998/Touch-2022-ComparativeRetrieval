the audi ads have a  more interesting message; though, i’m personally not much of a fan of  mentioning your top competitor in your marketing, since you’re just  giving your key competitor free advertising.

brand messages encompass  everything from emotional responses about the product line making drivers feel  youthful and inspired.
the  issue is that the ads are forgettable and barely interesting enough to share  from a brand enthusiast perspective.
the campaign also dips heavily into bmw’s heritage  of driver events.

this is a difficult question to answer and depends on what bmw is trying to gain from the spots; sales of course, but i’m sure some positive brand awareness is in the mix of campaign goals too.
from bmw’s press release about the campaign, “story of  joy” introduces a new creative aesthetic characterized by strong,  colorful images often conveying people and their experiences with the subtlest  of references to bmw products.”

unlike the3-series ad from 2008 that  brought together a strong emotive response from many bmw brand advocates and  fans, the new olympic spots fall flat giving people little reason to talk about  the ads or promote them to their social network.
the “story of joy” campaign is built off the early foundation first started with the launch of the bmw z4 campaign.

the campaign also dips heavily into bmw’s heritage of driver events.
within these entries i will not only share opinions on what i think brands are doing wrong (or right), but will also provide ideas to further enhance efforts that may improve your own marketing decisions.
