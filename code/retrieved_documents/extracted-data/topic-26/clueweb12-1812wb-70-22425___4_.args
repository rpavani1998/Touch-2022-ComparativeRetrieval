diminish dangerous, hurtful and polluted exhaust emissions (black haze, smock and poisonous gas emission) — almost 35% reduction in hydrocarbons (hc), around 90% decrease in carbon monoxide (co) and about 8 to 15% improvement in carbon dioxide (co2).guaranteed complete & correct combustion of fuel avoids any troubles and also allows a considerable savings and increasing the engine’s performances.- guaranteed complete & correct combustion of fuel avoids any troubles and also allows a considerable savings and increasing the engine’s performances.the "powercoding engine restoration" is recommended for brand new (just purchased) cars to keep the "first day" engine performance for over 500k km; or for still used engines that lost some or a lot of power and starts to lost engine oil with reduced compression.- diminish dangerous, hurtful and polluted exhaust emissions (black haze, smock and poisonous gas emission) — almost 35% reduction in hydrocarbons (hc), around 90% decrease in carbon monoxide (co) and about 8 to 15% improvement in carbon dioxide (co2).the powercoding is suitable for all vehicles (brand new, high-end brands petrol/diesel, imported or just local produced) - turbo or normal cars, for both new and used cars, which has mileage more than 30, 50, 100 or 200k km.smoother running engine by promoting a more complete combustion (reduce noise and vibration).the consumer will appreciate our contribution to their monthly income and enjoy the absolutely new driving pleasure after our service.the "powercoding engine restoration" is recommended for - brand new (just purchased) cars to keep the "first day" engine performance for over 500k km; - or for still used engines that lost some or a lot of power and starts to lost engine oil with reduced compression.to prevent the problem, exists a new technology,— by using a new product is possible to buy a car with 20% less volume (for example not the 250, but 220 mercedes); get the power of 250 one; and protect the engines against the wear and losing power for over 400k miles.- smoother running engine by promoting a more complete combustion (reduce noise and vibration).— by using a new product is possible to buy a car with 20% less volume (for example not the 250, but 220 mercedes); get the power of 250 one; and protect the engines against the wear and losing power for over 400k miles.product characteristics restore the combustion chamber geometry (size in pricission) and properties with protection of valves, piston, rings, cylinders and out-– & intake manifold.boost performance and horsepower for higher speed and acceleration whether on flat horizontal or slope level.- boost performance and horsepower for higher speed and acceleration whether on flat horizontal or slope level.
