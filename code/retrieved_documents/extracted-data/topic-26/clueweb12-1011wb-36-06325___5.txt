the x3's cruise speed up/down button (rocker switch on left wheel spoke) works like an auto down/up power window switch.
silent connection by caroline pardilla | march 8, 2012 i mentioned before in a fiat 500 post that i really dislike it when cars' bluetooth systems ask you to record a name for your phone.
out of curiosity, i checked out other long-termers that had that automatic-closing tailgate feature to see if they offered the same locking convenience.
dan edmunds, director of vehicle testing @ 2,911 miles categories: 2012 bmw x3shareshare 2012 bmw x3:
just get it right and leave it there.
i checked the audi's manual to see if it would clarify how you can lock the car by just hitting that close button but all itsaid was "press the button in the rear lid.
why not chill out and cool down?
but i had to capture the moment when tech-savvy, 20-something matt couldn't figure out that this was a mobile phone dock.
there are instances where it's nice to soften the ride up a little or quicken up the shift speed on the transmission, but it's often very subtle.
thanks for carrying me out to auto club speedway, and all -- and my helmet.
does that even matter to you?

only thing that would make the x3's system even better is if it, like the fiat, didn't have a limited number of slots to fill.

that's why i have to tip my hat to cars, like our 2012 bmw x3, that automatically detect your phone's name when you connect it.
while engaging in a rare driving condition recently (an open freeway in  l.a.) i engaged the x3's cruise control.
the boxed-in area where an internalcombustion engine resides can be hot?
but i'm sure that's an issue families wouldn't take umbrage with.
i have yet to meet one, though, and doubt i ever will.
our 2012 bmw x3's is my current favorite in our fleet.
i like it because i don't have to dig out the key fob in my bermuda triangle of a purse to secure the car.
our x3 has bmw's latest take on headlight design and it's slightly more complicated version of its traditional design.
our long-term 2012 bmw x3 xdrive35i (say that 5x fast) has a fancy-pants back-up camera system.
so, considering all the recent fuss about chrysler and the clint eastwood superbowl ad, does that make the new x3 an american car?

by john dipietro | march 8, 2012 after popping the x3's hood to check the oil (before realizing it has an electronic oil level monitor), this warning showed up both within the instrument cluster and on the navi's monitor.
the lights themselves work well and they don't look half bad when they're glowing eerily after you hit the unlock button.

our long-term 2012 bmw x3 was built in the spartanburg plant, along with the x5 and x6 suvs (z4 production was moved from spartanburg in august 2008.)
elastic strap thingie, stationary tiedown anchors, sliding tiedown anchors, flip-down grocery bag hooks, watertight well (lower right), ac 12v power outlet.
hard to tell as this point, although as leds become more flexible, the designs are only going to get more complicated.
made me wonder, though, how much the average buyer really cares.
either way, there's no doubt i'm going to turn around and look for myself.

the editors got a breaking news tip for the inside line editors?
the x3's cruise speed up/down button (rocker switch on left wheel spoke)  works like an auto down/up power window switch.
and totally forgettable.
this x3 is very much a 3 series on stilts, so it turns, accelerates and stops like a small sport sedan.
actually, i take that back.
there's only one real problem with the system -- it's not really needed.
i have no idea how the vehicle calculates this, nor do i do i know if they're at all accurate.
for a compelling video on how easy it is to connect an iphone, hit the jump.
should it be the a8l even though scott's already taken it to detroit?
it's got surprisingly good range.
no, you haven't done anything wrong.
last time i drove one, more than a year ago, it was nice and steady and competent.
in the case of our x3, bmw provides these handy guide lines that show the immediate space behind the vehicle if you back straight up and yet another set of guidelines that depict where it will end up if you crank the wheel one way or the other.

it's a trend that bmw largely started awhile back with its corona ring design, quickly followed up by audi and its leds.
you stay here while i go over there
instead, i would go slow, look over shoulder, adjust my line as i went in and largely ignore whatever the guide on the screen said.
sorry about my weak-sounding voice.
the x3 was pretty memorable for its inebriated throttle response and the subtlety of its efficient dynamics initiative (only a sticker on each rear window and the blue/red fill gauge monitoring my eco habits every time i lifted off-throttle).
now, just about vehicle has some signature light cue up front, some more interesting than others.

it also offers nice perspective and can be customized to your viewing preferences.
additionally, the new x3 was designed in california.
usually, the defroster's heating elements (the orange lines) run horizontally across the rear window.
would they prefer to save the money as long as they could see well at night?
i know some other luxury brands offer this feature and it comes in handy, especially when traveling on freeways where the speed limit can fluctuate between 65 and 70.
in fact, all x3s -- regardless of the country for which they're destined -- are built in spartanburg.
although it may not make much difference from a strictly functional perspective, aesthetically it's a nice touch.

i then tried just standing there til the lid closed.
by dan edmunds | february 23, 2012 sorry, 2012 bmw x3.
and now i'm thinking of doing it again.
i'll be gone no more than an hour...or four.
this is when i noticed the cruise's  bump up/down feature.
i tried the sport and sport+ modes on our x3 and didn't find them much better than the "normal" mode.
the one thing i do know is that i don't really trust them much.
by albert austria | march 15, 2012 bmw manufacturing co in spartanburg, sc, produced its first vehicle, a 318i, on september, 8, 1994.
the screen has rich color, the picture is large enough to show more than the half block i happen to be on, and it has plenty of room to show street names even when zoomed pretty far out.
i'll find you some nice shade.
i've generally been of the opinion that a well-tuned suspension/transmission/throttle setup shouldn't really need or even offer adjustments.
push it lightly and you can  adjust the speed by one or more mph, depending on how long you hold it there.
no, i didn't know i was going to need it.
check out what you can personalize on the back-up cam...
as you can see, the x3's are arranged in concentric fashion, echoing the sweep of the wiper.
i mean, he uses an ipad as his store's cash register!
when you lower the center console in the rear seat, you can access two pop-up cupholders.
along the way we encountered sand, rocks, and the three w's of the desert: washboard, washouts and whoop-de-doos.
this is when i noticed the cruise's bump up/down feature.
rear cupholders march 14, 2012 12:25 pm 2012 bmw x3:
you've earned a break.
now that's a nice screen
i wanted to be underwhelmed - especially after driving the new f30 sedan and soaking up the new turbo-four and revised chassis.
i really like this feature in our 2012 bmw x3; that you can just hit that lock button which will not only lower and close the liftgate for you, but will also lock up the car.
our x3 costs twice the price of our mazda 3, so you naturally get twice the screen.
personally, i like that bmw hasowner's manual videos.
kidding aside, it's nice to know that bmw cares.
the leather color that i mention is officially called nevada chestnut.

the reason i'm not sure is becausesometimes when i hit that close tailgate button the audi will make that sharp, high-pitched beep that the car is locked but it won't do this every time.
