not everyone has a garage or wants extra vehicles (which entail extra cost, insurance, registration, upkeep, etc.)the real engineering and design challenge is to make it all work to high standards together.after 3-4 years of ownership, they may now have the money to improve their vehicle should they want.the extra length also keeps the wheelbase from shrinking.what you end up with is a vehicle that is purpose-built, has no creature comforts, and on-road it rides like a jeep.the rear shocks are the component that defines how far the axle can hang, so they need to come off right away."the real engineering and design challenge is to make it all work to high standards together.but, i'll counter that by saying many people often need a car now - like when their other one craps out and isn't worth fixing.there's no roof, it costs a fortune, it's ugly etc.many people can afford, and want, a base $21k wrangler.a 3-inch suspension lift requires the driveshaft to hang down at a steeper angle.you gain a level of knowledge about your ride that you need to have with a 4x4.the new ones are longer in order to keep the rear differential pinion angleÂ at the proper angle with respect to the driveshaft.the new ones are longer in order to keep the rear differential pinion angle at the proper angle with respect to the driveshaft.and the new wrangler with the pentastar is pretty capable both on and off-road.
