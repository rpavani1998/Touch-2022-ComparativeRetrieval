so equipped, the bmw 328i would still offer the ability to morph between agreeable freeway cruiser, efficient commuter and reasonably capable back-road companion better than its competition.this now gives the bmw parity with the audi a4, which increased the length of its all-wheel-drive platform in 2009 in an effort to achieve handling dynamics more like a rear-wheel-drive car.all three systems integrate navigation, phone and audio controls into a menu-based knob-and-button interface, but audi's system is less elegant and integrated in its design than the others.the bmw doesn't inspire you to attack any back roads, but it offers a prudent degree of mountain-road-handling prowess to complement bmw's classic formula for all-around success.it handles better, brakes better, has a nicer interior (so says i/l), has equal or more features, and costs $5k+ less with the addition of awd.it's this resourcefulness in combination with enduring quality that makes the 2012 bmw 328i so profoundly effective in this segment.such details ultimately define a car's character and then earn brand loyalty.the interior provides the same familiar feel of a recent-generation 3 series with a touch of updating, and to our eyes the exterior styling easily makes it the best-looking car here.what's more, bmw's turbocharged, direct-injected 2.0-liter inline-4 is rated at 240 horsepower and 255 pound-feet of torque, which amounts to 10 hp and 55 lb-ft more than last year's normally aspirated 3.0-liter inline-6.it's ironic that the audi, which comes standard with all-wheel drive and provides the most sophisticated suspension configuration in the group, offers the lowest base price.the new electrically assisted steering isn't communicative on a granular level, but it isn't going to repel anyone either.dollar-for-dollar, the bmw cannot nearly compare to the audi for features and equipment.the benz approach to this four is similar in concept to bmw, and this turbocharged, direct-injected 1.8-liter inline-4 cranks out 201 hp and 229 lb-ft of torque.the 2012 mercedes c250 is marginally more costly than the a4 at $45,900 including the premium and multimedia packages.audi drive select, a $2,950 option, would have mitigated the impact of the big wheels and tires by tuning the throttle action, steering assist and damper action to suit different driving circumstances, but it wasn't a part of this a4's option package.
