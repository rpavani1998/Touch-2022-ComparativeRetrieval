that’s an improvement of 2 mpg in the city and 3 mpg highway compared to the outgoingâ naturally aspirated inline-six’s 19/25.â
the outgoingâ  mercedes-benz glk’s 3.5-liter v-6 and all-wheel drive was a bit thirstier  and could manage only 16/21.
we expect improvements for theâ  refreshed gasoline glk, which debuted at theâ new york auto show,  although no numbers have been released yet.
the new x3 has been rated for 21 mpg city and 28 highway.

when bmw launched the latest 328i with the same turbo four and eight-speed  auto as in the new x3, it predictedâ mileage of 24/36, only to have  the epa declareâ the new entry-level 3er good for only 23/33.
(the merc undoubtedly will have the  upper hand with its new diesel option, though, which goes on sale early next  year.)
