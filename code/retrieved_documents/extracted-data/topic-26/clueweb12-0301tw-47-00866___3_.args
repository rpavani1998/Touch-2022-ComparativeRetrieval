to me, just one car means it needs to do just about everything i want it to – decent mileage, fun to drive, hauls stuff and moves people when needed and fits on crowded intercity streets.so you could truly enjoy it your entire life, it has probably one of the most timeless looks you could possibly imagine and its is an absolute joy to drive.it can fit 6 people and still carry what is needed.6.2l v8 has proven to be a solid engine along with the super duty rear diff and axles with the weigh of an f150 and the 600% stronger suspension will last for ever!!!!it’d get pretty bad gas mileage, but it can outrun most everything out on the roads and it can go off-roading too!while the bmw m3 is funnier and faster it has a tiny trunk and back seat.sporty looks and performance, awd for bad weather, seats 4, 5 in a pinch, and does have some carrying ability, at least for the things i would be hauling.it’s gorgeous, turns heads everywhere, and it has a “cool” factor that only gets better with time.of course i would have to do some extensive customization to make the interior a little more comfortable and roomy, as well as converting it to bio-diesel, and maybe adding four wheel steering (i love my current suburban and the quadrasteer is the reason i won’t give it up).the only one that does this well with a decent amount of performance is the golf r.it’ll go anywhere, tow anything, carry anybody, while decimating any race next to it.mercedes e63 wagon hands down, it’s fast, it’s comfortable on long trips because it’s a big mercedes, handles well, and it’s a wagon that seats 7it doesn’t handle like a sport car, and i’ve owned faster vehicles, but it’s one of the most comfortable cruisers i’ve ever driven.the car can be new or old, it doesn’t matter; keep in mind it will be your only car, for the rest of your life and maintaining something like a vintage jaguar e-type might be troublesome.it’s got the size, engine, and awesome interior.
