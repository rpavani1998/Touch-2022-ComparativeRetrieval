the modern design, the best-in-class interior, the amazing available innovation package – the a7 is the best blend of functionality, design, and sport.the a7 and 640i both have weak 6cyl powertrains (compared to the motors in the jag and benz) and the jag’s grace is beginning to fade due to its aging design.they also have less unemployment (half of what the u.s. is at) and a higher yearly income.it’s the most luxurious, the best-looking (in my opinion, but that’s my taste), and is much classier.it’s the meanest-looking, has the best combo of engine power and efficiency, and it’s somehow faster than the jag even with 70 less hp.audi is considered a direct competitor shows how much value it offers.2012 mercedes-benz cls550 – $72,175 base price – thanks to a low price compared to the bmw, an $80,000 budget actually allows for some perusing of mercedes-benz’s long options list.the xf is beautiful but might have reliability issues.2012 jaguar xf supercharged – $68,975 base price – though not as purpose-built for this class as the others, the newly refreshed 2012 jaguar xf has plenty of style and, when supercharged, delivers 470 hp from its v-8 and a 0-60 mph time of under 5 seconds.2012 jaguar xf supercharged – $68,975  base price – though not as purpose-built for this class as the others, the newly refreshed 2012 jaguar xf has plenty of style and, when supercharged, delivers 470 hp from its v-8 and a 0-60 mph time of under 5 seconds.all of the other three offer far more for your money: more style, more power, more tech, more everything.2013 bmw 640i gran coupe – $76,895 base price – the 640i gran coupe’s near-$80,000 starting price surprisingly places this bmw in the same price range as the v-8 powered mercedes-benz cls550.plus, unlike the bmw 640i gran coupe and audi a7, the jaguar xf is only offered in the u.s. with v-8 powerplants.they are in a much better economic and fiscal state then the u.s.the bimmer looks hideous (like all other bmws), the mercedes lost its graceful looks when it was redesigned, and the audi is downright ugly (especially the back end).
