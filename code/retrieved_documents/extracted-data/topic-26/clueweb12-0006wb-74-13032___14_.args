the same 420-horsepower v8 provides the same killer thrust, and the same quattro all-wheel-drive system offers the same cornering grip you'll find in the four-door.the r8's soothing cabin is wrapped in sensual aluminum bodywork, giving the car an exotic appeal that further defies its (relatively) cheap price point.like every audi from this century, the a6 marries sleek exterior design with sumptuous cabin accoutrements, and places it all on a stout-yet-supple achitecture driving all four wheels (the smaller, 3.1-liter v6 can be had in front-wheel drive).this sleek coupe has taken audi's gift for gorgeous to a new level, with sweeping exterior lines and passionate interior panels that belie it's teutonic heritage.controlled through audi's next-generation multi media interface that adds a touchpad and will be called mmi touch, the a8's new tech tour de force will include a hard disk to handle nav, phone, audio data and graphics processing duties required to recreate the high-quality 3d images for google earth, while an optional gprs/edge modem will manage online content.interior materials, performance, high-tech features, heck even exterior styling and "presence" were all up to audi standards.like the ford and ferrari it's got a mid-engine v8, but unlike those two f-cars the audi offers all-wheel drive and an interior ambiance that makes the $132,000 as-tested price tag seem like a bargain (yes, the ferrari has a good interior too, but at a starting price approaching $200,000 it doesn't strike me as a "deal").this being their flagship vehicle, audi spared no expense, housing guests at the fontainebleau hotel miami beach, in the heart of "millionaire's row".i suspect the 350-horsepower v8, combined with all-wheel drive, gives it both the thrust and grip to counter that poundage.in short, a great car (or truck, or suv, or minivan) is a vehicle that can do at least two (or more) things really well.though concept cars can lead to prototypes which lead to production cars, more often than not they are simply bold displays of what an automaker is capable of.some on staff have described tip-in as overly aggressive, but i never found it objectionable in regular driving, and it makes blipping the throttle with the edge of your foot a snap while setting up your entry speed.at a starting price of $50k, and a finishing price closer to $60k once you add a few choice items like nav and adaptive headlights, this car is pricey -- plain and simple.more than 270 fascinating pictures up to 43 x 237 centimeters (17 x 94.5 inches) in size depict the hummer h2 in all its glorious details and from many highly unusual perspectives.using this as a guideline, the 2008 audi tt is a great car.
