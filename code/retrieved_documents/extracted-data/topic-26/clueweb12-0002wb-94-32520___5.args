porshe, bently and bugatti are also owned by the vw group and they don't have many issues either.
i also love the attention to detail in my audi.
yet i have heard horror stories - same as other car brands.

- audi 100 1989 180k miles, ran great, needed a auto trans rebuild at 140k, loved it but it got hit by a truck and totaled.
everytime we take it in they're rude as hell and try to pin it on my wife.
it's clearly not real wood.
the plastic glove box is always popping open.
doesn't mean everybody with these cars, but still seem to be the problem prone models.
i had a 2000 tt quattro for four years and it performed very well.
jmt4 new user | posts: 2 | joined: 02/08 posted: 02/09/08 08:10 pm the quality of our two audis has been fine.
audi in uk reimbursed all who had paid for this repair themselves.
they moved towards hardcore luxury with a hint of performance instead of their bread and butter e36 chassis performance that was worthy of the ultimate driving machine designation.
i had to replace the clutch at about 85k but considering the way i drive it that was no surprise
letters to audi and dot went on deaf ears.
3 blow outs later and the discovery of 46psi used in the fwd s-line version i bought bigger tires with a 102 load rating rather than the oe 94 and use a much more responsive 46 psi.
the e90 is ugly, and though the 335i has a fantastic engine, it has still diminished in road feel.
her parents who were convinced that toyota was god bought two matching 07' camrys.
they simply attach extra bits of plastic to the stock bumper and call it sport so they can charge more.
they come from humble origins which is partly why the reliability may have been inferior in the past and scarred some people.
i have no compalints, normal maintenance only.
incidentally, the mercedes is an sl600 which i have heard is expensive to maintain but ours has been trouble free.
infiniti owns the germans in performance and luxury (maybe not so much in the latter)
red gages that look like 80s video games.
maintaining a german car is never cheap, but owning one can be worth well worth it.
the ones i've spoken to all love their audis and praise the quality and reliability.
lots of the folks with steady problems seem to own an a6 or tt.
although it runs perfectly, i would never go near an audi again.
the power seats do no fully recline like the sedans even though there is a room.
her parents who were convinced that toyota was god bought two matching 07' camrys.
i do like the audi all wheel drive feature, but that's all.
brilliant idea, now they just need to make it reliable!
i travel quite a bit and let it sit for months at a time which dried out the seals.
personally, i can't wait until everyone can see at least two cars in front of them while drivintg since they won't have to try to look around some giant pos suv that's in the way.
hi , i have never owned a audi, love the cars and thinking of purchasing one, i currently own a chrysler product, and i'll tell ya there's no comparison as to repairing a chrysler, because it never ends.
i have spent almost $5,000 in repairs (right front and left rear corners replaced, for instance)since the warranty ran out two years ago and i will never own another audi.
it is almost totally unreliable and the dealer is a liar and a thief.
the power seats do no fully recline like the sedans even though there is a room.
the story does not represent the truth as it does not represent the thousands, or millions sold.
we're big fans of audi in general.
needs occassional new tires, new brakes, oil change.
the e90 is ugly, and though the 335i has a fantastic engine, it has still diminished in road feel.
okay, as a high mileage driver of a 2007 audi cabriolet 2.0t quattro, i have had some major disappointments in audi engineering.
my wifes 05' corolla has had countless issues, like roof leaks, the bumber falling off, and the pieces of the bumer falling off that make it the "sport model".
wow, the forum app is counterintuitive.
i also own a mercedes and a bmw and the mercedes is very reliable as is the bmw, but the bmw can be expensive to repair at times, but nothing to match the audi.
lots of the folks with steady problems seem to own an a6 or tt.
my bad luck has always been with toyota of all things.
i then bought a 2004 a4 3.0 with a six speed manual which has been great.
i'm not convinced it's real leather either.

use fake plastic coating and call it woodgrain.
first of all the weight of a mazda miata over the front tires that are the same size as the front tires on a supra or a cayman with a standard load rating when there is an xl available in the same model!
it's the same as a porshe cyenne only bigger, better fuel economy, more practical, and not as stuffy.
i own a 2000 audi tt 95,000 miles on it and i haven't had many problems at all.
our other vehicles are acuras (a 2006 rl and a 2003 mdx with 150,000 miles) and they, too, have been virtually trouble-free though they are not as entertaining to drive as the audis.
looking for some good and bad advice on the audi a4 2000-2005 all models all engines.
they simply attach extra bits of plastic to the stock bumper and call it sport so they can charge more.
i am planning to evaluate an a4 when the '09s hit the showrooms, and the only truly disappointing thing about the vehicle is that i didn't notice that the s-tronic trans will be available on the 4 banger.
only maintenance issue has been a new turbo failed at 74k.
3 blow outs later and the discovery of 46psi used in the fwd s-line version i bought bigger tires with a 102 load rating rather than the oe 94 and use a much more responsive 46 psi.
roof leaks, plastic peices inside falling apart and scratch easily.

i purchased a 2001 tt roadster new and still own it.
only issue now are the window seals on which the rubber is starting to fail.
always getting freindly gestures and compliments from other owners on the road.
i'll be replacing the timing belt before long because they recommend replacing it every 90-100k miles but aside from that, take care of your car and it wont give you many issues.
ok, seriously though, both bmw (with the 1 series) and audi (with the a3) tried to predict silly american values with those vehicles.

that, or knowing their relation to volkswagen makes people assume they'll inherit all their old problems too.
the dealers kept deflecting diagnosis of the defective instrument panel  chip which caused a myriad of problems until they wore me out and i paid for the replacement myself.
xyrium new user | posts: 6 | joined: 07/08 posted: 07/24/08 10:23 am audi knows exactly what americans have typically wanted: giant lumbering suvs that no one can see around, the driver of which can't stay in their own lane, are single guys without a family or need for such a large pos, but it's big enough for them to keep their big mac and fries in.
why, because we think bigger is better, or the guys and women that drive them must feel inadequate and require a large vehicle to make them feel better.
i love it and still get compliments on its looks.

....and might as well use the a6 platform to balance the weight and add more room in the back since it's not so sporting.

torque down low, and enough hp to run with the turbo six from bmw.

reliability is always an afterthought, i would always lease a german car, not purchase it, and definitely not own one outside of the warranty period!
