the mkz concept previews lincoln’s new design direction as it looks to snag young buyers away from the “efficient but soulless” german luxury manufacturers.the mkz concept’s interior, like the exterior, is elegant and contemporary; it gets attractive looking aluminum and recycled poplar trim, and is bathed in champagne-colored leather that contrasts nicely with the brown dashboard.the primary considerations are a smooth ride and luxurious interior.this looks more like the current fusion than the next generation of fusion does… and without a sense of scale it looks fat and huge, like it’s based on the taurus instead… ford is doing well with ford, but just because you upscale some of the materials and give it slightly different sheetmetal does not mean you can call it luxury and compete with the likes of mb or bmw, or even cadillac.though i suppose there will always be a gap between a brand like ford or gm that do not specialize in luxo but only offer it as a option; they will always be somewhat watered down compared to their german competitors.the interior also gets mylincoln touch, and a large lcd screen that functions as the mkz’s instrument panel.where the fusion looks like an aston martin midsize sedan with a loud front end, large haunches and flared wheel arches, the mkz concept goes for a more subdued, refined look.ford releases big changes to their ford line-up, and then tries to upsell it to lincoln when everybody already knows they can get the same tech for thousands less by buying a ford.however, the interior looks great and production ready.the front end could use some work, but i think it looks a lot like the audi a7 which is definitely a good thing.engine availability is currently unknown but rumor has it the next lincoln mkz may get a 2.7-liter ecoboost v-6 that won’t be seen in any other ford products, in addition to the 1.6 and 2.0-liter ecoboosts, and the 2.0-liter hybrid version.i would even say that they could’ve ditch jag and kept volvo but either way, keep a proven and popular upscale brand that is clearly different from ford.interior looks very production-ready.in addition, they seem incapable of coming up with names for their cars instead of letters.it’s taut and modern but lincoln still can’t find a charismatic and recognizable style direction.
