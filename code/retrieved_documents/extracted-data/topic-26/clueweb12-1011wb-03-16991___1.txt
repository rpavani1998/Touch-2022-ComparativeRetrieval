comparison test: 2010 audi s4 vs 2009 bmw 335i categories: audi,bmw,luxury cars,sedans
sure... everyone wants to sound like an expert...
so has audi finally cracked this code?
the "fair" comparison is not that easy; s4 may be between 335 and m3 and not necessarily a direct competitor to either.
so spending the $46-60 grand puts you as well in the bmw 335i territory...so thats a bunch of pesos for the bmw as well, not only for the audi.
no one has tried harder to break the stranglehold than audi.

it dlu says: 05:44 pm, 10/13/09 you can't get an m3 for less than $65-70k in the boston area; the early s4's out now are between $55k to $60k here.
but still can't see spending the $46-60 grand on it when its bumping into m3/is-f price territory.
it won fair and square.
now is audi playing the bmw game, just as bmw plays that game to the infinity g37.
i'd have to sample both to make a decision.

earlier reports hinted that the s4's supercharger might make it slow off the line -- this comparison test made me a fan of the new s4 alman08 says: 07:08 pm, 10/13/09 i like how hondacura4 has to define "direct competitors" for every car.
how much does gas have to cost before it influences your carbuying decisions?
there have been countless challengers over the years, yet they always fell short in one way or another.
the latest challenger is the 2010 s4, a newly supercharged, all-wheel drive sedan that has been realigned to better match up with bmw top 3 series four-door.
it report it inlinesix says: 12:02 pm, 10/13/09 thats a bunch of pesos for the audi.
the s4 is a direct competitor to the 335.
however, the quattro audi just punched the rwd bimmer in the gut as validated by this comparison test.

if you want to see a direct audi vs bmw m3 comparison you will have to wait until the audi rs4 debuts.

s4 is nice but that price is steep.
so you have to take the as-tested price difference with a grain of salt.

latest poll gas prices are on the rise again and are expected to hit $5/gal again.
it's a4 had been getting closer with every redesign and refresh, but was never quite there.
3 series, the s4 vs 335 comparison is perfectly logical and valid.
the audi may be the better performer but it's not worth the extra coin in my eyes.
do you see a pattern here?
i can get a 335i 6mt sedan the way i want it for around $46k, which i consider pricey.

i like the 3l supercharged motor though.
lexus is-f i never said you couldn't compare the 2 but its obvious the m3 would have the advantages right out of the box.
the s4's performance is impressive but its price isn't.
what i got out of this (and c&d's) article is that the awd is easier for someone like me to exploit its abilities and get more fun out of.
there have  been countless challengers over the years, yet they always fell short in one  way or another.

but now audi is the winner.
it hondacura4 says: 03:51 pm, 10/13/09 i actually like both cars
e.g.: a smaller car or a smaller engine option.
a nicely equipped m3 will set u back $70 grand....

you really have to work and put a lot of things on it that do nothing to make it drive better to spend $70,000 on an m3 sedan hondacura4 says: 02:09 pm, 10/13/09 "how about a comparison of a s4 vs. m3?
the editors got a breaking news tip for the inside line editors?
few cars have rules their class like the bmw 3 series.

so even though you have an m3 in your fleet you go out and get a less expensive 335 and then marvel that the bmw gets beat?

according to car & driver, when you option the bmw up to match the standard equip on the audi, then add the sport package to both cars they are within a few hundred dollars of each other, and the audi has awd (a $2k option for the bmw).
it sevenbob says: 12:56 pm, 10/13/09 crcr_driver i just went to the bmw site and put every option on it for $70,770 you can get it with the double clutch transmission and premium package for $60,075.
it was only a few years ago when audis would give you more for your money than mbs and bmws.
but i wouldn't pay $60k for the audi or the 335 if it were that expensive.
