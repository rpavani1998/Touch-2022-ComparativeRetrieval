as always, the aesthetic experience is wonderful, as the combination of high-quality, soft-touch materials, design architecture that doesn't try to visually intimidate you, and a sound driving position really set any audi apart from the competition.and thanks to electronics that help configure the q5's power, handling and control feel for the sporting driver, this audi also tries to deliver the personalized performance of the new coupe-style crossovers like the bmw x6 and forthcoming acura zdx.these are fine pieces, sparkling evidence of audi's ability to think laterally and develop examples of unexpectedly useful technology, a tradition that began with the inline-5 engine, moved on into all-wheel drive and has since popularized everything from direct fuel injection to led running lights.unlike some of its natural competitors, it successfully walks the tightrope between too-boring luxury and too-harsh performance.the 3.2-liter v6 is more than sufficient to propel the 4,300-pound all-wheel-drive q5, and the multimode transmission is well matched with the output.the q5's electronics configure throttle response, transmission shift points, steering effort and suspension setting according to four different parameters: comfort, automatic, dynamic and individual.under braking, the q5 stops from 60 mph in 117 feet, and the brakes are effective and fade-free on every stop, while dynamic mode makes a slight bit of difference in reducing brake dive.of all its competition, the 2009 audi q5's 110.5-inch wheelbase is the longest, which helps maximize interior passenger volume.for all this, though, audi's strength continues to be simple transportation, vehicles that take you down the road and deliver you safely.the steering isn't too light (unlike like that of pre-2009 audi products), and the nifty comfort/auto/dynamic/individual meta-controller offers palpable differences in vehicle behavior.the u.s.-specification q5 also comes already equipped with a towing package as standard equipment, and it's rated for 4,400 pounds, which is 900 pounds more than the best of its competition.the seats are great and three-zone air-conditioning is standard.the field of view is commanding, obstructed only by the outside rearview mirrors, devices that seem to grow ever larger by federal mandate, which is one reason why you never see anyone turn their head to check a vehicle's blind spot before changing lanes (much less use the turn signal).though this engine seems to lack any sort of personality, it delivers 270 horsepower at 6,500 rpm and 243 pound-feet of torque at 3,000.indeed, the q5 affords 101.5 cubic feet of living space, with 29.1 cubic feet of cargo capacity behind the second seat and 67.3 cubic feet with the second seat folded.
