different fuels have unique concentrations of carbon, in a similar way that, say, different types of soda contain different amounts of sugar.
the carbon footprint provides an estimate of the annual greenhouse gas pollution, measure in carbon dioxide equivalents (co2-equivalent), from each vehicle model based on both the energy efficiency of the vehicle, the carbon content of the fuel being used, and driving 15,000 miles annually.
the civic hybrid emits an estimated 4.4 tons of co2-equivalent per year, while the jetta releases 6.4 tons per year, or approximately 45 percent more global warming emissions.
in short, hybrids still carry the day.

3) carbon footprint values obtained from www.fueleconomy.gov.
air pollution all vehicles sold today are tested in a laboratory for tailpipe emissions and given a certification level — a grade, effectively — that specifies how clean the vehicle is in the emissions of four major pollutants: carbon monoxide (co), nitrogen oxides (nox), hydrocarbons, and particulate matter (pm).
the bin 2 certification earns the civic hybrid a 9 on epa’s air pollution score, while the diesel jetta’s bin 5 certification earns it a middle-of-the-road score of 6.
first, the compression ignition combustion process that occurs inside diesel engine cylinders is more efficient than the spark ignition process that occurs in gasoline engine cylinders, wasting less energy as the fuel is converted into mechanical motion.
comparing the global warming emissions per mile, or carbon footprint, allows a direct comparison between two vehicles, while the epa greenhouse gas score shows how a vehicle relates to the rest of the fleet.

comparing the environmental performance of diesels and hybrids miles per gallon (mpg): the mpg ratings for the civic hybrid are about 13% better than the diesel jetta in highway driving (45 versus 40 mpg) and 38% better in city driving (40 versus 29).
while diesels offer impressive fuel economy and have made improvements to their smog-forming emissions performance, efficient hybrids offer comparable (if not better) fuel economy, while still besting diesels on both the smog and global warming pollution fronts.
this “carbon content” affects how much co2 is emitted into the atmosphere when the fuel is burned.
both the diesel jetta and civic hybrid are top scorers when compared to all other available vehicles in the showroom.
it should be noted that a vehicle’s fuel economy is highly dependent on manufacturers design decisions.
however, the exceedingly impressive tailpipe emissions and fuel economy performance of today’s most popular hybrids allow them to outperform their diesel counterparts.
this characteristic of diesel fuel is why using a fuel economy comparison between gasoline and diesel vehicles to determine global warming benefits can be misleading.
this higher energy density helps push the vehicle farther down road, getting it—quite literally—more miles per gallon.
most of today’s hybrids and even some conventional gasoline vehicles are considerably cleaner, certified to “bin 3,” “bin 2,” (the lower the bin number, the better for the environment) and even the near-zero-emission california “pzev” certification.
this reflects the benefits of hybridization in city driving and the strong fuel economy performance of diesel engines at sustained highway speeds.
on a full fuel cycle basis (that is, incorporating not only the emissions at the vehicle itself, but also the emissions related to the extraction, refining and transporting of the fuel from wellhead to pump), the burning of diesel fuel emits roughly 13 percent more co2 per gallon of fuel burned than does burning a gallon of gasoline.
global warming pollution: the mpg values help you determine how far you can go on a gallon of fuel, but more information is needed to accurately determine the global warming impact of a vehicle.
when comparing diesels and hybrids, consumers should just be aware that “performance” in the categories of air pollution, global warming pollution and oil dependence are not merely a function of the vehicle’s fuel economy, but rather also a function of its emissions control system and even of the fuel’s chemical makeup.
while there are other secondary global warming pollution factors for autos, the pollution a vehicle puts into the atmosphere is largely proportional to the amount of fuel the vehicle burns.
second is the fact that on a per-gallon basis, diesel fuel contains about 13 percent more energy than gasoline.
note, there are no diesel and hybrid models that allow for a pure apples-to-apples comparison on every major attribute; we chose these models for their popularity and market comparability.
this “carbon content” affects how much co2 is emitted into the atmosphere when the fuel is burned.
generally, the more fuel-efficient a vehicle is, the better it is from a global warming standpoint.
thus, from an oil security standpoint, merely examining the fuel economy of a diesel vehicle doesn’t capture the full picture.
using our previous example, a diesel vehicle that consumes 25 percent less fuel than a gasoline-powered vehicle would, in fact, consume only 15 percent less crude oil than the gasoline vehicle.
the ghg score ranks all vehicles on a scale of 1 to 10.
epa ghg score: while the diesel jetta might appear to be a global warming laggard based on the previous comparison, the epa ghg score puts these emissions into a broader context.
meeting the “bin 5” standard is a significant achievement for diesels which, because of the diesel combustion process, produces high levels of nox and pm in the engine cylinders.
oil dependence: comparison of petroleum consumption estimates show that the diesel jetta consumes about 45 percent more petroleum than the civic hybrid.
comparing the environmental performance of diesels and hybrids miles per gallon (mpg): the mpg ratings for the civic hybrid are about 13% better than the diesel jetta in highway driving (45 versus 40 mpg) and 38% better in city driving (40 versus 29).
overall, the hybrid civic (42 mpg) out-performs the diesel jetta (33 mpg) in combined city and highway fuel economy by 27 percent.
as we’ll see shortly, however, the impressive fuel economy numbers of diesels don’t tell the whole story when it comes to assessing other attributes such as global warming, or oil dependence performance, or air pollution.

while diesels offer impressive fuel economy and have made improvements to their smog-forming emissions performance, efficient hybrids offer comparable (if not better) fuel economy, while still besting diesels on both the smog and global warming pollution fronts.
nevertheless, diesels can offer global warming and petroleum reduction benefits compared to their conventional gasoline counterparts.
