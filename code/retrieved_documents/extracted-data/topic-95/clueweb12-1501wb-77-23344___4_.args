proactively resolving ergonomic issues can have a significant impact in reducing workersâ€™ comp costs, improving productivity, and decreasing fatigue-induced driver errors.besides health issues, poor ergonomics is also a key contributor to preventable accidents.on the diesel front, new, stringent emissions standards and stellar fuel economy have helped diesel passenger car models achieve "green" status.recent higher fuel prices and moderating acquisition costs have improved the economics of hybrids in fleets.many diesels outperform gas - in general, high fuel costs combined with stellar fuel economy, federal diesel tax incentives, and a smaller spread between gas and diesel model acquisition costs translate into a quicker return on investment than the models in the gas to hybrid analysis.by mike antich a one-size-fits-all approach to truck specifications is an ergonomic minefield, which could have litigious consequences.in general, high fuel costs combined with stellar fuel economy, federal diesel tax incentives, and a smaller spread between gas and diesel model acquisition costs translate into a quicker return on investment than the models in the gas to hybrid analysis.but, as many fleets have shown, where there is a will, there is a way to meet fleet sustainability goals, despite fiscal austerity.featured jobs blog market trends green fleet initiatives gain momentum despite cost constraints by mike antich most fleets want to be environmentally friendly, but are often hamstrung by fiscal constraints when procuring greener vehicles.fuel prices have fluctuated wildly on an upward trajectory, affecting payback lengths for alt-powered vehicles.nonetheless, toyota, lexus and honda have the lowest, or are tied for the lowest, in lifecycle costs in each segment.since most companies replace approximately one third of their fleet vehicles each year, they can tailor selectors to favor more fuel-efficient vehicles, so long as they are able to fulfill the fleet application.volkswagen jetta diesel has the lowest lifecycle costs of all diesels, though it takes five years to return its premium.honda insight and toyota prius, the two proprietary hybrid models, have the lowest costs per mile of any of the hybrid models.civic cng does not beat the gas- or hybrid-powered civic models in overall cost.
