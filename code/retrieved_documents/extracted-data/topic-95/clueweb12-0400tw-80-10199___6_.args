the value proposition is clear: diesel engines offer similar fuel savings to hybrids at a lower cost and without the anxiety attached to a new technology.about 30% of vw's overall sales in canada are diesel engines compared to 50% in europe, where consumers are rewarded for driving more efficient vehicles of all types through the tax regime there.diesel sales accounted for about 1% of total u.s. sales in 2011, while the hybrid market was more than double that.part of the discrepancy is that the diesel engine is a proven technology, whereas there is still a lot anxiety about electrified vehicles' batteries, which can cost upward of $10,000 each.in canada last year, hybrid and electric vehicles amounted to just 1.5% of the total vehicles sold, with sales weighed down by consumer anxiety around the technology and price.the average diesel-powered vehicle will cost about $2,000 more than a traditional internal-combustion engine, while a hybrid variation might cost upward of $7,000 more, depending on the make and model, he says.derek mcnaughton , canwest news service the state of california recently announced plans to offer owners of new low-emission chevrolet volts a us$1,500 tax credit on top of the us$7,500 rebate already given to those who buy the electric vehicle.it was just the latest example of how governments across north america have been pushing consumers toward electric and hybrid vehicles and off fossil fuels."we're introducing diesel to bring down the average fuel economy for our vehicle fleet."with diesel, you also pay more, but you do not have to compromise." josh bailey, vice-president of research at canadian black book, said diesel engines also carry the added advantage of a higher resale value.with the fuel savings and higher resale value, buyers of new diesel-powered cars can find themselves with an extra couple of thousand dollars in their pocket after just a few years.for example, the diesel option on the older grand cherokee that went out of production in 2008 cost consumers roughly $6,000 extra." diesel engines on average offer about 25% greater fuel efficiency than a traditional combustion engine, or roughly the same amount as a hybrid, says george magliano, ihs global insight analyst.there's probably going to be other fuels in here, like natural gas, that are likely going to be a part of it.diesel sales made up about 3% of sales in canada last year, compared to about 1.5% for hybrid and all-electric vehicles, says dennis desrosiers, a leading auto analyst in the country.
