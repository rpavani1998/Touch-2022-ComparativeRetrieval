replacing spark-ignition engines with diesel engines and components would yield fuel savings of about 37% at an added cost of approximately $5,900 per vehicle, and replacing spark-ignition engines with hybrid engines and components would reduce fuel consumption by 43% at an increase of $6,000 per vehicle.a european study lead by scientists at the university of edinburgh (uk) has found that the combustion-derived ultrafine particles from diesel fuel are the predominant mediators of the adverse effects—harming blood vessels and increasing the chances of blood clots forming in arteries, leading to a heart attack or stroke.the hecs engine incorporates novel and conventional technologies to achieve low co2 emissions and a 17% reduction in fuel consumption, while also meeting euro 6 emission standards without aftertreatment.in his announcement, winterkorn said that over the mid-term, the plug-in hybrid offers great potential because it combines the best of two worlds in one vehicle: unlimited internal combustion engine performance combined with attractive electric mobility ranges in everyday driving.the new engine is more powerful, more fuel efficient and produces lower emissions than its predecessor.a large body of work shows that exposure to road traffic and air pollution may be a trigger of adverse cardiovascular events such as angina, myocardial infarction, and heart failure, with long-term exposure increasing the lifetime risk of death from coronary heart disease.it delivers optized performance, lower consumption as well as less noise and vibration.a three-year biofuel trial organized by neste oil, helsinki region transport (hsl), and proventia has recently been completed, and the results have shown that neste oil’s nexbtl renewable diesel can significantly reduce local emissions that have a direct impact on urban air quality.the new mercedes-benz b-class, which will make its debut at the frankfurt international motor show (13 to 25 september 2011) and go on sale in europe in november, will offer a number of new technologies to lower fuel consumption and co2 emissions, including a new series of four-cylinder gasoline engines with direct injection and turbocharging; a new diesel engine; a new 7-speed dual clutch transmission; a new 6-speed manual transmission; and new assistance systems.according to its estimates, adopting the full combination of improved technologies in medium and large cars and pickup trucks with spark-ignition engines could reduce fuel consumption by 29% at an additional cost of $2,200 to the consumer.the regenerative braking system converts kinetic energy to electricity during deceleration, stores it in capacitors and then uses it to power the vehicle’s electric equipment, thereby reducing load on the engine and saving fuel.a high ignition quality (high cetane number) fuel is well suited for operation under an advanced diesel combustion mode (high efficiency clean combustion, hecc) and leads to reductions in all primary pollutant emissions—i.e., thc and co as well as nox and pm—according to research by a team from the pennsylvania state university.the new york state energy research and development authority (nyserda) is awarding $4.6 million to help 17 new york state companies develop and commercialize innovative new transportation technologies intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, decrease reliance on fossil fuels, and create jobs.such measures include the recovery of methane from coal, oil and gas extraction and transport; methane capture in waste management; use of clean-burning stoves for residential cooking; diesel particulate filters for vehicles (some of the largest bc emission reductions are obtained using diesel particle filters on high emitting vehicles); and the banning of field burning of agricultural waste.results of a new study led by a team from west virginia university suggest that urea-based selective catalytic reduction (scr)-equipped heavy-duty diesel engines operating within the not-to-exceed (nte) operating zone over a critical exhaust temperature (about 380 °c) and under favorable ambient dilution conditions could contribute to high nanoparticle concentrations to the environment.
