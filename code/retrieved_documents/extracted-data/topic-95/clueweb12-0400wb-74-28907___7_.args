using hybrid technology to cleanly power our children’s school buses can help reduce transportation costs, create new jobs and cut our dependence on imported fossil fuels.using hybrid technology to cleanly power our childrens school buses can help reduce transportation costs, create new jobs and cut our dependence on imported fossil fuels.this provides additional power for acceleration, making school buses ideal candidates for hybrid technology because of the frequent stops and starts they perform along their daily routes.the hybrid school bus is expected to attain a 40 percent increase in fuel efficiency, which becomes even more essential with the rising fuel costs affecting many school districts.as the carolinas continues to grow, we must ensure the right balance of energy efficiency, alternative energy and new energy sources, and these plug-in hybrid buses will help us and others learn more about this promising technology.we believe that diesel-electric hybrid technology can be made commercially viable for the school bus industry and this collaboration is the next step in making that a reality.the hybrid electric school bus project is an exciting example of how key stakeholders from the utility industry, business and government can form partnerships that produce great benefits for communities in which we live.the project has demonstrated that industry, government and non-profits can successfully work together to improve the environment and encourage the economy.bringing about positive change in the marketplace in regards to this type of alternative energy will yield many benefits for north carolina and the nation.in addition, even though current international diesel engines on many existing school buses produce no visible smoke and minimal emissions, the hybrid program will reduce engine emissions even further.as the carolinas continues to grow, we must ensure the right balance of energy efficiency, alternative energy and new energy sources, and these plug-in hybrid buses will help us and others learn more about this promising technology.”the system is based on a parallel architecture, allowing the system to utilize both diesel and electric power in a highly efficient manner.the hybrid electric school bus project is an exciting example of how key stakeholders from the utility industry, business and government can form partnerships that produce great benefits for communities in which we live.”“the hybrid electric school bus project is an exciting example of how key stakeholders from the utility industry, business and government can form partnerships that produce great benefits for communities in which we live.”“this project provides operational benefits to school districts, while also providing the reduced emissions desired by the u.s. environmental protection agency and a valuable return on investment to school boards,” said ewan pritchard, p.e., advanced energy’s hybrid program manager.
