changeover from the hdi diesel engine to the electric motor occurs automatically, thanks to astop & start system which places the hdi diesel engine in standby and restarts it as and when conditions require (accelerator pedal usage, low battery charge level, etc), - the two power sources also complement each other in certain driving conditions (“boost” effect during strong acceleration, when overtaking another vehicle, for example).
this ingenious compartment also allows storage of the load space cover.
for example, to ensure that drivers need never take their eyes from the road, in the manner of a fighter plane, essential driving information is projected onto a retractable transparent panel which cleverly extends from the instrument panel visor.
to obtain this level of performance it uses the latest generation eccs ( extreme conventional combustion system) combustion chamber design, a variable-geometry low-inertia turbocharger, a high-pressure injection pump allowing a maximum pressure of 2000 bar in the common rail and solenoid injectors with eight apertures.
the hobby type lower tailgate opens to reveal a boot with a flat floor equipped with longitudinal securing rings that inspire quality and strength.
the ptmu is an electronic controller that automatically manages the different operating modes of the hdi diesel engine and electric motor in a very innovative way for the driver, helping optimise fuel consumption.
driving enjoyment for the next generation for peugeot, the legitimacy of this technology goes well beyond its eco-efficiency.
here, the external style successfully evokes the vehicle’s high innovative content.
while the driver is invited to enjoy renewed driving pleasure, the 3008 hybrid4 has a wealth of surprises in store for its other occupants, preserving all the qualities of modularity and comfort of the original 3008.
while the driver is invited to enjoy renewed driving pleasure, the 3008 hybrid4 has a wealth of surprises in store for its other occupants, preserving all the qualities of modularity and comfort of the original 3008.
thanks to its intelligent multiflex interior and clever integration of the batteries and the special rear suspension, the 3008 hybrid4 can also be transformed to offer a considerable load capacity under the parcel shelf of 420 litres (362 dm3 vda), with 66 litres (29 dm3 vda) consisting of storage under the boot floor.
this frees up a gigantic 1501 litre compartment that is easy to load.
this results in a number of advantages not only in terms of customer benefits but also from the standpoint of the project’s economic and industrial model.
from the side, the window surrounds are edged with chrome in the upper section.
the large front grille helps to define the vehicle’s status and off-road character, with its two distinctive chrome bars it is reminiscent of those found in the world of the suv.
it enhances this technological ambience in the same way as the 7’’ colour display which provides information on the energy flows.
in keeping with the notion of the hybridization of genres, the car’s passenger compartment is a new source of surprise and emotion.
the customer benefits are immediate with a high level specification and a reduction of 35% in fuel consumption, a real breakthrough for a car of this size and performance.
to obtain this level of performance it uses the latest generation eccs ( extreme conventional combustion system) combustion chamber design, a variable-geometry low-inertia turbocharger, a high-pressure injection pump allowing a maximum pressure of 2000 bar in the common rail and solenoid injectors with eight apertures.
in this case, activation of the hdi diesel engine is programmed to coincide with more sustained phases of acceleration.
naturally this is combined with the latest generation “octosquare” eolys additive-enhanced particulate emission filter (fap) system.
peugeot’s choice of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising environmental demands with driving sensations until now not available in a hybrid vehicle.
new developments may be more or less marked according to the generation and above all the category of the vehicle.
distinctive materials are deployed throughout to accentuate the crossover feel and explore new avenues of expression.
man-machine interface a 7’’ 16/9 colour screen or a multi-function display, according to the car’s specification, informs the driver in real time of the operating status of the hybrid power train and the battery charge status by means of an 8 bar electronic gauge system.
these sensations are enhanced further by the general ambience of the passenger compartment: high-tech and exclusive.
in the same perspective, a second-generationstop & start system is used.
the rear module of the hybrid4 system also includes a multi-arm rear suspension system providing the guarantee of excellent road holding.
this allows optimal driving with a mix of low fuel consumption and dynamic driveability, - “zev” mode (zero emission vehicle) provides access to an extensive all-electric mode.
an expansive fascia panel, controls within easy hand’s reach and an ergonomic centre console clearly separate the territory of the pilot.
combined with a raised and dominating driving position it has everything in place to reward its drivers and offer a range of new driving sensations not previously found in a hybrid vehicle.
the headlamps display a renewed expressiveness, with the integration of a bar of leds providing a daytime lighting function and accentuating the car’s visual appeal.
the customer benefits are immediate with a high level specification and a reduction of 35% in fuel consumption, a real breakthrough for a car of this size and performance.
from the boot, a rear seat folding system, controlled by switches mounted on the load area side trims, allows the seats in the second row to be folded automatically, as if by magic.
energy recovery an energy recovery system (when the electric motor becomes a generator) enables kinetic energy to be transformed into electrical energy to recharge the ni-mh batteries during deceleration (release of the accelerator and braking).
virtuous association an obvious association adapting hybrid4 technology to the 3008 crossover makes obvious sense.
naturally this is combined with the latest generation “octosquare” eolys additive-enhanced particulate emission filter (fap) system.
this allows optimal driving with a mix of low fuel consumption and dynamic driveability, - “zev” mode (zero emission vehicle) provides access to an extensive all-electric mode.
the performance of the hybrid4 is therefore directly comparable to that obtained with a single hdi diesel engine of a much higher capacity, with good levels of responsiveness backed by a real breakthrough in terms of reduced fuel consumption and co2 emissions (around 35% less in the combined cycle for equivalent performance).
it enhances this technological ambience in the same way as the 7’’ colour display which provides information on the energy flows.
since diesel engines consume less fuel than petrol engines, they are the ideal choice for this type of hybridization.
the costs of the rear module are, therefore, reduced because of the technical possibility of deploying hybrid4 technology in different segments, on different body shapes, etc, regardless of the type of combustion engine used.
in terms of performance, the 3008 hybrid4 can benefit from the combined power of the hdi diesel engine and electric motor during acceleration, for an immediate surge in power (“boost” function).
the vehicle then becomes a “city run-around” par excellence thanks to the total absence of noise and emissions.
this accentuates the imposing height of the waistline, which with its exclusive 17’’ oltis alloy wheels and black waist moulding, contributes to the sense of strength apparent in the vehicle as a whole.
electric motor the synchronous permanent magnet electric motor is located cleverly at the rear of the vehicle.
the large grab handle on the centre console enables them to find the ideal position for a comfortable journey.
an inverter and a converter are used to control the electric power.
the gear lever with its modern and elegant design is emblematic of hybrid4 technology.
in the medium term, this battery technology remains the most appropriate in terms of cost and industrialisation for vehicles produced in large volumes.
in keeping with the notion of the hybridization of genres, the car’s passenger compartment is a new source of surprise and emotion.
the ring of the steering wheel bearing the signature “hybrid4” hy for its part adds a touch of exclusivity to the car.
high-voltage battery pack the ni-mh (nickel metal hydride) batteries are located under the boot sill, near the electric motor.
in the future, and for markets where diesel is less popular, a petrol combustion engine may also serve as the base for hybrid4 type hybridization.
in the medium term, this battery technology remains the most appropriate in terms of cost and industrialisation for vehicles produced in large volumes.
offering peace of mind, safety and driveability, four-wheel drive accentuates the vehicle’s dynamic character.
the ptmu is an electronic controller that automatically manages the different operating modes of the hdi diesel engine and electric motor in a very innovative way for the driver, helping optimise fuel consumption.
here too, the presence of a “hobby” lower tailgate, and the wide black and chrome protective trims on the lower section, illustrate the “outdoor” feel of this crossover.
the hybrid rear section of the 3008 hybrid4 will be produced in sochaux and in mulhouse.
hybrid technology uses two power trains which can operate alternately or simultaneously: - the hdi diesel engine operates in its most optimal operating window on longer, out-of-town journeys.
its benefits reside in its ability to fuse together different genres: - through its external architecture, with a body which carries the genes of the suv, mpv and saloon, - through its specific stylistic codes in relation to the 3008 range overall, combining power and protection, strength and elegance, leisure and status, - through its surprising and technological interior, combining the ambience of an exclusive hi-tech coupé with practical and efficient modularity, - through its dynamic specification since thanks to peugeot’s expertise and the technologies employed, this “tall single compartment” vehicle offers a level of driveability that is the envy of many a saloon.
driving enjoyment for the next generation for peugeot, the legitimacy of this technology goes well beyond its eco-efficiency.
at the end of 2010, peugeot will continue in this vein by becoming the first manufacturer to launch a latest-generation 100% electric vehicle in europe, the peugeot i0n.
peugeot’s choice of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising environmental demands with driving sensations until now not available in a hybrid vehicle.
indeed hybrid4 technology, at low speed, allows all-terrain capabilities equivalent to those of an suv: the driver will no longer be worried by the prospect of a muddy path or a snowbound uphill drive to the ski resort; - “sport” mode favours quicker gear changes at higher engine speeds than normal mode.
hybrid technology uses two power trains which can operate alternately or simultaneously: - the hdi diesel engine operates in its most optimal operating window on longer, out-of-town journeys.
the inverter controls the torque of the electric motor by regulating the current from the high-voltage battery pack.
the 3008 hybrid4 thus offers a new and highly technological approach to motoring, combining renewed driving enjoyment with a very low level of co2 emissions.
the “hybrid” power train basically combines a diesel engine and an electric motor.
in terms of road holding, this innovative power train is well served by the chassis, recognised for its dynamic qualities.
this is true in particular of the new and specificguérande & tramontane two-tone leather finish which subtly combines bright pale grey on the seat cushions with a black finish on the sides of the seats.
a real breakthrough in terms of improved fuel consumption and co2 emissions, dynamic performance levels, four wheel drive, electric only mode, etc, the hybrid4 technology brings a number of benefits without any compromises.
driving pleasure contrary to current beliefs, the use of hybrid technology also offers improved driving freedom and introduces new benefits at several levels: - high performance combined with excellent driveability, - freedom and simplicity of use with the possibility of choosing four different operating modes: zev, 4wd, sport, auto, - silent operation, with the possibility of driving in electric only mode, - peace of mind offered by the safety inherent in four wheel drive, - environmental friendliness with emissions starting from 99 g/km of co2.
initially, peugeot has relied logically on the recognised expertise of the psa peugeot citroën group in the field of diesel engines with hdi fap technology.
this high-voltage battery pack comes in addition to the standard 12v battery under the bonnet, which carries on performing its normal duties.
on higher specification versions, emissions can rise to 104 or 108 g/km of co2 in the combined cycle.
a distinctive style appeal and protective power the new peugeot 3008 hybrid4 stands out due to its cutting-edge technology, allowing a seamless combination of responsible driving and driving enjoyment, but also by its specific styling.
indeed, as well as the social benefit of a steep reduction in fuel consumption, the level of performance provided by this technology will delight even the most demanding customers in terms of road holding, responsiveness, driveability and peace of mind, regardless of road conditions, with the possibility of enjoying silent operation in town in all-electric mode.
these include the jukebox function, linked to the presence of a hard disc, the gsm function, a usb connector, a dvd player, the bluetooth®system and also a graphic interface which shows city buildings in “full 3d”.
in terms of performance, the 3008 hybrid4 can benefit from the combined power of the hdi diesel engine and electric motor during acceleration, for an immediate surge in power (“boost” function).
a real breakthrough in terms of improved fuel consumption and co2 emissions, dynamic performance levels, four wheel drive, electric only mode, etc, the hybrid4 technology brings a number of benefits without any compromises.
the headlamps display a renewed expressiveness, with the integration of a bar of leds providing a daytime lighting function and accentuating the car’s visual appeal.
secondly, this architecture is achieved by means of the use of a simple and compact rear module containing the electric motor, its ancillary equipment and also the rear drive train and suspension.
with a 3008 benefiting from hybrid4 technology, the aim is to appeal to customers who expect not only environmental-friendliness and technological sophistication, but also real driving enjoyment.
this level of performance gives the 3008 hybrid4 record-breaking credentials in terms of the co2 emissions/ maximum power ratio.
it also allows the 3008 hybrid4 to be recognised by the integration of familiar features.
the large front grille helps to define the vehicle’s status and off-road character, with its two distinctive chrome bars it is reminiscent of those found in the world of the suv.
a viable technical and economic solution the rear installation of the vehicle’s “electric components” provides a new technical and economic solution.
the inverter controls the torque of the electric motor by regulating the current from the high-voltage battery pack.
its benefits reside in its ability to fuse together different genres: - through its external architecture, with a body which carries the genes of the suv, mpv and saloon, - through its specific stylistic codes in relation to the 3008 range overall, combining power and protection, strength and elegance, leisure and status, - through its surprising and technological interior, combining the ambience of an exclusive hi-tech coupé with practical and efficient modularity, - through its dynamic specification since thanks to peugeot’s expertise and the technologies employed, this “tall single compartment” vehicle offers a level of driveability that is the envy of many a saloon.
the driver can apply this mode to drive discreetly around town or demonstrate the silence of the vehicle in electric mode, etc, - four-wheel drive mode (4wd) instructs both power trains to operate together as far as possible; the rear wheels are then driven by the electric motor and the front wheels by the hdi diesel engine.
four wheel drive this original layout allows the possibility of four wheel drive: the hdi diesel engine under the bonnet drives the front wheels, while the electric motor (in the rear drive train) drives the rear wheels.
these sensations are enhanced further by the general ambience of the passenger compartment: high-tech and exclusive.
the end result is a crossover with a length of 4.36 m, four wheel drive, a maximum power output of 200 bhp, fuel consumption in the combined cycle of only 3.8 litres/100 km and emissions of 99 g/km!
operation of the bmp6 is even more enjoyable with hybrid4 technology insofar as the rear electric motor becomes active during gear changes.
based on the manufacturer’s technical specifications, bosch has provided its expertise with respect to the electric motor, the power electronics, the reversible high-voltage alternator (stt) and other systems managing the dialogue between these components and the braking and trajectory correction systems (abs and esp).
with the 3008 hybrid4 crossover, the environmentally-friendly combination of diesel and electric power also paves the way for: - 4 wheel drive, - a maximum power of 200 bhp, - zev mode (zero emission vehicle), - 3.8 litres/100 km, with 99 g/km of co2.
the 3008 hybrid4 thus offers a new and highly technological approach to motoring, combining renewed driving enjoyment with a very low level of co2 emissions.
peugeot’s choice of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising environmental demands with driving sensations not previously available in a hybrid vehicle.
electric motor the synchronous permanent magnet electric motor is located cleverly at the rear of the vehicle.
the performance of the hybrid4 is therefore directly comparable to that obtained with a single hdi diesel engine of a much higher capacity, with good levels of responsiveness backed by a real breakthrough in terms of reduced fuel consumption and co2 emissions (around 35% less in the combined cycle for equivalent performance).
the hybrid4 strategy capitalising on the best know-how hybrid4 technology is based on the combined use of the best technologies developed by peugeot’s engineers: diesel engine, electric motor, second-generationstop & start and an electronically-controlled sequential manual gearbox.
this successful crossover results from the hybridization of several motoring concepts: suv, saloon, compact mpv, coupé… added to this are the benefits of hybrid4, which in the present case and for the first time combines diesel and electric power to offer the perfect response to customer expectations: “ecological” four wheel drive, controlled power, a high level of safety, assured modularity and a new driving sensation, all within an environmentally responsible approach.
the lower front panel further reinforces these off road aspirations, thanks in particular to the black quarter bumpers aligned with the headlamps.
this “high voltage” stop & start system with a generous output of 8 kw can also generate the electricity needed for operation of the electric motor under all circumstances if required (four wheel drive mode).
based on the manufacturer’s technical specifications, bosch has provided its expertise with respect to the electric motor, the power electronics, the reversible high-voltage alternator (stt) and other systems managing the dialogue between these components and the braking and trajectory correction systems (abs and esp).

the costs of the rear module are, therefore, reduced because of the technical possibility of deploying hybrid4 technology in different segments, on different body shapes, etc, regardless of the type of combustion engine used.
in this mode, the notion of “controlled power” comes into its own: coupling of the diesel engine with the electric motor provides more dynamic performance, optimally distributed and transmitted to the road by the four wheel drive for a level of stability and driveability that will appeal to all motoring enthusiasts.
this high-voltage battery pack comes in addition to the standard 12v battery under the bonnet, which carries on performing its normal duties.
from the boot, a rear seat folding system, controlled by switches mounted on the load area side trims, allows the seats in the second row to be folded automatically, as if by magic.

driving aids: high-tech equipment for safety and driving enjoyment comfortably seated behind the steering wheel, drivers will note among the equipment at their disposal certain references to the world of aviation.
the rear module of the hybrid4 system also includes a multi-arm rear suspension system providing the guarantee of excellent road holding.
the performance of this equipment is further enhanced by the fitment of optional 16’’ “mud & snow” tyres.
the rear spoiler, two-tone with a high gloss black section, helps to differentiate the 3008 hybrid4 from other models in the range, as do the chrome badges which decorate the sides and rear of the car.
this brings about significant gains in fuel consumption and emissions in urban conditions.
it also allows the 3008 hybrid4 to be recognised by the integration of familiar features.
suppliers to develop its hybrid4 technology, the psa peugeot citroën group has teamed up with suppliers offering the best know-how in each field.
combined with a raised and dominating driving position it has everything in place to reward its drivers and offer a range of new driving sensations not previously found in a hybrid vehicle.
the choice of architecture was also guided by the search for optimal efficiency and consistency.
this requires the high-voltage batteries to be sufficiently charged.

the large grab handle on the centre console enables them to find the ideal position for a comfortable journey.
the maximum combined power output can then reach 147 kw (200 bhp) through the addition of 120 kw (163 bhp) from the 2.0 litre hdi fap diesel engine and the temporary peak of the electric motor (27 kw, or 37 bhp).
simplicity of use from a functional point of view, a selection knob on the centre console enables the driver to choose between four different operating modes: - “auto” mode: the electronics automatically control the entire system, including transitions between the hdi diesel engine and the electric motor.
they can enjoy the passenger compartment and its original ambience, bathed in the light diffused by the immense panoramic glass roof.
a maximum torque of 500 nm is available, split 300 nm at the front from the hdi diesel engine and a maximum of 200 nm at the rear generated by the electric motor.
since diesel engines consume less fuel than petrol engines, they are the ideal choice for this type of hybridization.
in the final analysis, the 3008 hybrid4 is a crossover with an exceptional technological content offering unique versatility and safety, unrivalled driving pleasure and co2 emissions of a very low level.
the vehicle then becomes a “city run-around” par excellence thanks to the total absence of noise and emissions.

the originality of this design helps visually to seat the rear of the vehicle.
the electric motor and its ancillary equipment (inverter, converter, etc) are fitted at the rear of the vehicle.
from the side, the window surrounds are edged with chrome in the upper section.
at the rear rear suspension to ensure a dynamic performance on a par with the marque’s road holding standards over a very varied range of vehicles (mid-range mpvs, top of the range body shapes, etc), the rear electric module, transferable across several different platforms, comprises a multi-arm rear suspension within which are housed the electric motor and the reduction gearbox.
in terms of “vehicle dynamics”, the esp of the 3008 hybrid4 incorporates an “improved traction control system” (asr) able to exploit the car’s four wheel drive capabilities to the full on challenging surfaces.
the rear spoiler, two-tone with a high gloss black section, helps to differentiate the 3008 hybrid4 from other models in the range, as do the chrome badges which decorate the sides and rear of the car.
pursuing this common sense approach of capitalising on the best existing components and expertise, it was only natural to use the electronically-controlled 6-speed manual gearbox (mcp), not only for its engine management capabilities but also for its optimisation of fuel consumption.
operation of the bmp6 is even more enjoyable with hybrid4 technology insofar as the rear electric motor becomes active during gear changes.
driving pleasure contrary to current beliefs, the use of hybrid technology also offers improved driving freedom and introduces new benefits at several levels: - high performance combined with excellent driveability, - freedom and simplicity of use with the possibility of choosing four different operating modes: zev, 4wd, sport, auto, - silent operation, with the possibility of driving in electric only mode, - peace of mind offered by the safety inherent in four wheel drive, - environmental friendliness with emissions starting from 99 g/km of co2.

new developments may be more or less marked according to the generation and above all the category of the vehicle.
similarly, the electric parking brake (fse) coupled with the hill assist function, facilitates the driver’s manoeuvres and optimises space in place of the manual hand brake.
inside its roomy architecture and the driving position bears all the hallmarks of a top-of-the-range coupé, or even an aircraft cockpit.

driving aids: high-tech equipment for safety and driving enjoyment comfortably seated behind the steering wheel, drivers will note among the equipment at their disposal certain references to the world of aviation.
on the 3008 hybrid4, these components have been made as small as possible to optimise the installation in the vehicle.
peugeot connect services offered with wipcom 3d will also be accessible.
peugeot’s choice of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising environmental demands with driving sensations not previously available in a hybrid vehicle.
the hybrid rear section of the 3008 hybrid4 will be produced in sochaux and in mulhouse.
this accentuates the imposing height of the waistline, which with its exclusive 17’’ oltis alloy wheels and black waist moulding, contributes to the sense of strength apparent in the vehicle as a whole.
the gear lever with its modern and elegant design is emblematic of hybrid4 technology.
at the rear rear suspension to ensure a dynamic performance on a par with the marque’s road holding standards over a very varied range of vehicles (mid-range mpvs, top of the range body shapes, etc), the rear electric module, transferable across several different platforms, comprises a multi-arm rear suspension within which are housed the electric motor and the reduction gearbox.
distinctive materials are deployed throughout to accentuate the crossover feel and explore new avenues of expression.
combined with the folding front passenger seat, the 3008 hybrid4 offers a perfectly flat floor from the hobby to the fascia panel.
indeed hybrid4 technology, at low speed, allows all-terrain capabilities equivalent to those of an suv: the driver will no longer be worried by the prospect of a muddy path or a snowbound uphill drive to the ski resort; - “sport” mode favours quicker gear changes at higher engine speeds than normal mode.
by launching the world’s first full diesel hybrid vehicle, the 3008 hybrid4, peugeot will create a new type of vehicle in terms of freedom of use and driving enjoyment.

finally, multiple impressions emanate from the style of the car: tranquil strength, contained power, controlled dynamism… comfort: driving and sharing interior ambience:
this recovery system enables the driver to use “free” energy and reduce fuel consumption accordingly.
the hdi diesel engine is linked to an electronically-controlled manual six-speed sequential gearbox: - its electronic control enables significant savings in fuel consumption, in automatic mode, compared to a traditional automatic gearbox or even a traditional manual gearbox, - it offers real driving enjoyment gained from the possibility of choosing the gear change mode at any time - manual or automatic - with the gear lever or via controls behind the steering wheel.
enables the driver to choose between four different operating modes: - “auto” mode: the electronics automatically control the entire system, including transitions between the hdi diesel engine and the electric motor.
the choice of architecture was also guided by the search for optimal efficiency and consistency.
offering peace of mind, safety and driveability, four-wheel drive accentuates the vehicle’s dynamic character.

a viable technical and economic solution the rear installation of the vehicle’s “electric components” provides a new technical and economic solution.
these switches, located above the centre console, add a further touch of style to the in-car ambience.
the 3008 hybrid4 therefore stands out by its visual signature, but also by the fact that it is the first 3008 to receive the marque’s new badge on its bonnet.
this results in smooth gear changes for optimum comfort.

the converter converts the 200 volts from the high-voltage battery pack into 12 volts to supply the vehicle’s onboard systems.
it must also provide new driving sensations, improved driveability and improved driving enjoyment.
at the end of 2010, peugeot will continue in this vein by becoming the first manufacturer to launch a latest-generation 100% electric vehicle in europe, the peugeot i0n.
similarly, the electric parking brake (fse) coupled with the hill assist function, facilitates the driver’s manoeuvres and optimises space in place of the manual hand brake.
high-voltage battery pack the ni-mh (nickel metal hydride) batteries are located under the boot sill, near the electric motor.
here, the external style successfully evokes the vehicle’s high innovative content.
it also leaves intact the possibility of using larger capacity engines.
the ring of the steering wheel bearing the signature “hybrid4” hy for its part adds a touch of exclusivity to the car.
the “hybrid” power train basically combines a diesel engine and an electric motor.
firstly, it avoids the need for any major redesign of the engine compartment, while also allowing a better weight distribution.
inside the car too, the hybridization of concepts opens up unsuspected possibilities.
initially, peugeot has relied logically on the recognised expertise of the psa peugeot citroën group in the field of diesel engines with hdi fap technology.
the design of the multi-arm rear suspension is the fruit of all of the marque’s expertise in this field, bearing in mind that the same technology is also employed on the 407, recognised for its excellent driveability, road holding and comfort.
on higher specification versions, emissions can rise to 104 or 108 g/km of co2 in the combined cycle.
a maximum torque of 500 nm is available, split 300 nm at the front from the hdi diesel engine and a maximum of 200 nm at the rear generated by the electric motor.
four wheel drive this original layout allows the possibility of four wheel drive: the hdi diesel engine under the bonnet drives the front wheels, while the electric motor (in the rear drive train) drives the rear wheels.
in the future, and for markets where diesel is less popular, a petrol combustion engine may also serve as the base for hybrid4 type hybridization.
the originality of this design helps visually to seat the rear of the vehicle.
furthermore, the driveability, safety and eco-efficiency of the system are based on simple, reasonable and consistent technological choices.
a diesel engine still remains the most efficient and versatile choice to power any vehicle, - the electric motor takes over from the hdi diesel engine in phases of lower power demands, particularly when starting up or driving at low speed and decelerating (energy recovery).
latest-generation stop & start system this system places the hdi diesel engine in standby when the vehicle is at a standstill (at traffic lights, a stop sign or in a traffic jam, etc) and when the vehicle is being driven in electric mode.
in terms of “vehicle dynamics”, the esp of the 3008 hybrid4 incorporates an “improved traction control system” (asr) able to exploit the car’s four wheel drive capabilities to the full on challenging surfaces.
wipcom 3d includes all the benefits of the marque’s existing satellite navigation systems.
this frees up a gigantic 1501 litre compartment that is easy to load.
pursuing this common sense approach of capitalising on the best existing components and expertise, it was only natural to use the electronically-controlled 6-speed manual gearbox (mcp), not only for its engine management capabilities but also for its optimisation of fuel consumption.
with their exceptional efficiency, hdi fap diesel engines - thermodynamically more efficient than a petrol engine and offering like-for-like fuel consumption of 30% less - are clearly the best internal combustion engine choice.
