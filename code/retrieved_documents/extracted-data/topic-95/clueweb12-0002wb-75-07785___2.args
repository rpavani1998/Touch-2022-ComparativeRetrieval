diesels may produce more smog, but they can also run on biodiesel.
add in the high up-front cost of diesel engines and emission controls and diesel vehicles could become a more costly approach to petroleum reduction than improved gasoline vehicles.
i just want to point out that i cannot imagine the clean diesel enthusiasts i know attacking and attempting to undo legislation that provides incentives for hybrids.
also what is not mentioned is that gasoline vehicles typically give off relatively large quantities of fugitive vocs which diesel vehicles do not (diesel fuel is virtually non-volatile at ambient conditions).
people who are making their money from investments don't need to drive to work.
the problem is that it costs countries like saudi arabia about $2 per barrel to pump oil (which they now sell for $45-55).
mercury has demonstrated a diesel-hybrid vehicle call the meta one which is categorized as pzev, according to mercury.
shift the hidden costs of petroleum dependence onto petroleum sales itself, rather than using income taxes to pay those hidden costs - lowering the cost to consumers, which encourages continuing our dependence.
and remember, hybrid technology does something that diesel engines alone will never do - serve as a technological stepping-stone to fuel cell vehicles.
overall, the work you're doing is great.
i agree that the details are important and that there does seem to be potential problems.
diesels have a ways to go to even meet theaverage standard, never mind getting cleaner than average.
clean diesel efficiency, plus hybrid efficiency, plus a sustainable and renewable biofuel, plus advanced pzev emissions...
diesel fuel actually contains more energy per gallon than gasoline and producing each gallon of diesel requires 10- 25 percent more petroleum and results in 12-18 percent more heat-trapping gas emission than a gallon of gasoline—this takes a big chunk out of diesel’s commonly quoted benefits.
and to top it off, the corolla does 0 to 60 in less than 10 seconds, a couple seconds faster than the vw’s 11.6 seconds.
while current diesel vehicles typically emit higher levels of particulate matter (pm) than an equivalent gasoline vehicle, particulate filters (dpfs) are being used in europe which reduce the pm emissions to below ambient levels, i.e., dpf-equipped diesel vehicles are functioning as pm filters as they run around.
as for costs, b20 biodiesel where i live is actually less than petro-diesel and even regular grade gasoline.
providing incentives to only diesel vehicles, especially without adequate performance criteria for tailpipe pollutants, is a misguided approach and forces an unnecessary tradeoff between fuel economy and smog or toxic tailpipe emissions.
and remember, hybrid technology does something that diesel engines alone will never do - serve as a technological stepping-stone to fuel cell vehicles.
mercury already has a pzev diesel-hybrid engine in development: http://www.mercuryvehicles.com/extras/news/01_10_05_mer_meta_one.asp the clean diesel legislation you are trying to undo does not provide incentives for the diesel engines and fuels of the past - it is aimed at the clean diesel fuel and clean diesel engines of the future.
on thursday, dtf even had a”ride and drive” event on capitol hill touting their “clean, quite, and fun” to drive diesel vehicles.
the problem with the status quo is that the corn lobby fights the hydrogen lobby, and the winner will likely be political rather than practical.
if diesel vehicles are unable to meet progressively tighter emission standards, future progress in protecting public health may stall.
diesel vehicles have certainly become cleaner over the years because of stronger emission standards, but they are still far from the cleanest vehicles on the road today.
so, once alternatives start making a subtantial dent in our petroleum imports, enough that the oil countries are not pumping at full capacity, they can lower prices enough to force alternatives back out of the market, and still be making a tidy profit.
hybrid and clean diesel are complimentary technologies - not competing.
the new clean diesel fuel will enable advanced diesel emmissions systems to be employed and virtually eliminate all diesel nox and particulate emissions.
now, the house eliminated credits for hybrid vehicles in the energy bill, but supports credits for diesel vehicles in the energy bill they just passed… and now, even thepresident backs polluting consumer incentives by giving taxpayer dollars to diesel vehicles, taking us a step backwards on childhood asthma and lung disease in our elderly.
also, without any form of petroleum tax, just increasing our efficiency will result initially in reducing demand, which will drop petroleum prices, making it more difficult to get the majority of the public to buy efficient vehicles, or use alternatives - so consumption will go back up.
in the long run, the only way we can improve our economy (related to energy costs) will be to create a petroleum tax.
for example, if we calculate that creating, say, a 50 cent per gallon petroleum tax would create an additional $90 billion in tax revenue (that's roughly what it would create), income tax rates would be reduced across the board just enough to reduce income tax revenue by $90 billion).
and to top it off, the corolla does 0 to 60 in less than 10 seconds, a couple seconds faster than the vw’s 11.6 seconds.
as our report,the diesel dilemma, shows while diesels may have a role to play, a diesel-only approach to petroleum reduction could result in greater costs to consumers than utilizing more efficient gasoline vehicles for achieving equivalent petroleum reductions.
however, diesel vehicles are needed to utilize biodiesel.
diesel vehicles have certainly become cleaner over the years because of stronger emission standards, but they are still far from the cleanest vehicles on the road today.
let's stop this destructive in-fighting and focus on the the real problems.
true, i’m making a comparison of today’s vehicles and not accounting for the fact that diesel vehicles will have to meet the same set of emission standards as gasoline cars by 2009.
furthermore, diesel vehicles are capable of running on biodiesel (b100).
i think it's important to characterize this not as a "tax increase", but rather shifting a portion of income tax away from that and into a petroleum tax (since as i said, income taxes should be reduced proportionately with the creation of the petroleum tax, so that people are not paying more in total.
add in the high up-front cost of diesel engines and emission controls and diesel vehicles could become a more costly approach to petroleum reduction than improved gasoline vehicles.
additional voc emissions come from the production, distribution, and refueling of gasoline, something for which “tailpipe” emissions do not account.
posted by: aqccm | may 05, 2005 at 12:33 pm rather than creating yet more complex credits to try to create a minor encouragement for something good, it would be far, far simpler and more effective to do one simple thing: create a petroleum fuel tax, to account for all of the hidden costs of petroleum dependence, using the revenue to decrease income taxes proportionately.
posted by: odograph | may 05, 2005 at 01:58 pm hybrids are great, and i agree that we should work to insure incentives are in place to purchase the clean and efficient models - but there's no reason to attack clean diesel technology.
as odograph said, the devil is in the detials, and that's a pretty darned important one.
diesel-hybrids are capable of 30-40% better mileage than gas-hybrids.
just wanted to quickly join in this conversation with a bit of friendly pushback for ted.
costs are not appreciable.
but the structure of these standards will allow some vehicles to emit a lot more pollution than the average.
hybrids are much cleaner but run on gasoline.
first of all, the statement that the vw jetta tdi makes “…44 times more smog-forming nitrogen oxide emissions…” actually should read “…44 times more smog-depleting nitrogen oxide emissions…” since nitrogen oxide (no) actually destroys ground-level ozone (glo).
it’s no2 that is the “ozone precursor” in that it photodissociates into no + atomic oxygen (o) which subsequently is available to combine with molecular oxygen (o2) to make ozone.
biofuels are another complimentary technology which can be implemented immediately in any diesel powered or flex fueled vehicle.
the problems of continuing our petroleum dependence are so large, and will only get worse, that it should be considered an issue of extreme national importance - economically and strategically (and environmentally, although that's less of a concern to most people) - that it is justifiable to have a "sin tax" on petroleum, to encourage more efficient use, and use of alternatives.
gasoline vehicles would need filters just to keep up!
as our report,the diesel dilemma, shows while diesels may have a role to play, a diesel-only approach to petroleum reduction could result in greater costs to consumers than utilizing more efficient gasoline vehicles for achieving equivalent petroleum reductions.
higher * fund research possible replacements * allow a free market in those replacements that would seem to guarantee that the bad goes away, and the most efficient replaces it.
truly clean diesel can certainly be in the clean car future mix, but we have to have a realistic baseline about what it can do and what the cost will be to the consumer to get there.
just achnowledge that our nation's energy and emissions goals must be approached from a number clean engine and clean fuel directions.
much like diesel technology, biodiesel has potential, but still has cost and compatibility issues, not to mention the fact that some are trying to pass 2% biodiesel (b2) mixed with regular diesel as a "green solution" where it really is not, and there is the factor of a 10% increase in nitrogen oxide emissions for 100% biodiesel (though you're talking about major reductions in carbon and soot).
even though the diesel jetta receives better fuel economy numbers than the corolla, they emit the same amount of heat-trapping co2 emissions.
use of biodiesel significantly reduced emissions from diesel engines in and of itself.
now, the house eliminated credits for hybrid vehicles in the energy bill, but supports credits for diesel vehicles in the energy bill they just passed… and now, even thepresident backs polluting consumer incentives by giving taxpayer dollars to diesel vehicles, taking us a step backwards on childhood asthma and lung disease in our elderly.
level the playing field more for alternative fuels (by having consumers pay the true price of petroleum at the pump), or even give them an advantage.
additionally, beginning next year, diesel fuel in the us will be ulsd (ultra low sulfur diesel) which will enable diesel emisions to be fantastically cleaner.
oh, i suppose the old hummer h1 model (in diesel) might qualify as well.

posted by: scottn | may 05, 2005 at 12:01 pm the ucs members certainly have a right to their opinions about light-duty diesel vehicles (apparently always with the connotation “dirty”).
even though the diesel jetta receives better fuel economy numbers than the corolla, they emit the same amount of heat-trapping co2 emissions.
this vehicle emits about 44 times more smog-forming nitrogen oxide emissions and between 4 and 8 times more toxic diesel particulate emissions (that's soot, folks) than a comparable toyota corolla .
hi everyone, don anair ca vehicles analyst with my first hybridblog.
we can't pump nearly enough petro here in the us to get us back to importing less than 50% of the oil we use.
fedex is already using diesel hybrids in some of their delivery trucks.
i could just as easily point to the misleading claims made for hybrids or hydrogen etc.
for example, take the diesel vw jetta.
diesel vehicles might go 30 to 40 percent farther on a gallon of diesel, but that’s not the whole story.

we have a faq on biodiesel that does a pretty nice job surveying the landscape, you can find it at http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_vehicles/trucks_and_buses/page.cfm?pageid=1415.
absolutely no petroleum, a completely renewably fueled with a closed carbon cycle resulting in a net of zero co2 emissions.
i bought a diesel last year because it was what i could get (i couldn't even find a prius to sit in, let alone test drive)
in my opinion as an air quality scientist (yes, i’m a “concerned scientist” too, i just don’t happen to agree with all of ucs’s positions, especially on diesel vehicles), anthropogenic vocs are what are causing glo levels to remain stubbornly high in many urban areas.
providing incentives to only diesel vehicles, especially without adequate performance criteria for tailpipe pollutants, is a misguided approach and forces an unnecessary tradeoff between fuel economy and smog or toxic tailpipe emissions.
but that simply skirts the real issues - all these technologies can contribute substantially to the global reduction of conventional oil consumption.
in fact, the energy bill in the house could make this prospect a reality by encouraging the sale of diesels that emit as much as 10 times more smog forming pollutants than some of the hybrids already on the road.
i own a two 2004 vw diesels and fuel both with fuel grown right in my home state of virginia - b100 soy biodiesel.
the potential of the pih for slashing need for fuel of all kinds should not be underestimated.
for example, take the diesel vw jetta.  this vehicle emits about 44 times more smog-forming nitrogen oxide emissions and between 4 and 8 times more toxic diesel particulate emissions (that's soot, folks) than a comparable toyota corolla .
the right solution is to tax oil so that alternatives become much more desirable to the general public and remain competitive.

if the government was really going to support the small, efficient, and increasingly clean diesels they have in europe that might be good - especially if moves to clean up those diesels pay off.
the "either/or" choice was made by the house, which eliminated all non-diesel incentives in the energy bill, and made those incentives such that it does not push toward truly cleaner diesel.
not so with diesels.
on thursday, dtf even had a”ride and drive” event on capitol hill touting their “clean, quite, and fun” to drive diesel vehicles.
of course, this is our government, our president, our congress ... which makes me think they are using this "and diesel" clause to pay off detroit and subsidize those huge 4x4 diesel king-cab trucks i see being used as "communter cars" down here in orange county, ca.
i hope that the diesel incentives don't encourage more guzzling.
a petroleum tax would both encourage people to purchase more efficient vehicles, and *also* use domestic alternative fuels.
saudi arabia and other oil countries could sell oil for $20 per barrel and still have a huge profit margin.
if diesel vehicles are unable to meet progressively tighter emission standards, future progress in protecting public health may stall.
scottn - while it is true that our beloved gov't decided to cut the non-diesel incentives, i propose that your time would be best spent with the positive message - ensure that incentives continue for all 'green' vehicles.
the common enemy are the gas guzzling suvs and other low-efficiency vehicles.
but that argument is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
say we can produce biodiesel for $30 per barrel.
since the majority of consumers buy based solely on price, that will just force competitors back out of the market, and put us right back at being wholly dependent on petroleum.
but the structure of these standards will allow some vehicles to emit a lot more pollution than the average.
