schaeffer noted that this, together with diesel’s low emissions, durability, efficiency and availability, meant that clean diesel would play a strong role in establishing a sustainable energy future.he added that the growing use of hybrid technologies and renewable diesel fuels in concert with diesel engines would enable significant savings in petroleum consumption and co2 emissions.he concluded diesel would play a significant role in the emergence of the green energy economy because of diesel fuel’s unique attributes – its energy density, low-sulfur content, widespread availability and compatibility with biofuels.complementing these economic benefits are clean diesel’s extremely low emissions, including approximately 20 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline counterparts due to the vehicle’s greater efficiency.although today’s diesel engines still run primarily on diesel fuel, these needs are being reduced through engine and vehicle enhancements, application of hybrid technologies and greater use of renewable diesel fuels.underpinning diesel’s advantages is its inherent superior energy density compared to other fuels such as gasoline, natural gas and renewable fuels.high fuel economy gains are driving demand for diesel hybrid buses, making them the technology of choice for many of the country’s top transit districts.most importantly, these technologies will be available more quickly and at less cost than others that require significant infrastructure investments.it is also becoming more expensive, making the switch to renewable fuels one which will provide both environmental and economic benefits.due to this strong demand for its diesel vehicles and their superior environmental performance, vw sees clean diesel as a key factor in its strategy for meeting tighter fuel economy standards and other anticipated environmental standards.as for next generation renewable diesel fuel, mccormick noted that there was already commercial production of this fuel from poultry fat in the u.s (70 million gallons/yr) and that these fuels, which are hydrocarbons meeting the same astm standard as petroleum diesel, were being developed from a variety of feedstocks and had shown exceptional fuel properties.even many work trucks found in communities across the country are integrating hybrid technologies to reduce fuel consumption.make diesel technology a smart, high-value, low-cost investment for reducing america’s dependence on petroleum.this three-part luncheon series discussed how commercial availability of renewable diesel fuel and further fuel economy enhancements such as those currently underway in doe’s vehicle technologies program make diesel technology a smart, high-value, low-cost investment for reducing america’s dependence on petroleum.he noted that there was no one silver bullet, but rather several silver technology pellets that would all contribute to the realization of a greener transportation future; however the lack of available alternatives, particularly in the construction, locomotive and marine sectors, would mean that clean diesel technology would be part of our transportation system for the foreseeable future.
