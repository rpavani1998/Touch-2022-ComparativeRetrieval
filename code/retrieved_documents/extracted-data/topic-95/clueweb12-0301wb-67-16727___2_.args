the performance of the hybrid4 is therefore directly comparable to that obtained with a single hdi diesel engine of a much higher capacity, with good levels of responsiveness backed by a real breakthrough in terms of reduced fuel consumption and co2 emissions (around 35% less in the combined cycle for equivalent performance).this brings about significant gains in fuel consumption and emissions in urban conditions.indeed, as well as the social benefit of a steep reduction in fuel consumption, the level of performance provided by this technology will delight even the most demanding customers in terms of road holding, responsiveness, driveability and peace of mind, regardless of road conditions, with the possibility of enjoying silent operation in town in all-electric mode.in this mode, the notion of “controlled power” comes into its own: coupling of the diesel engine with the electric motor provides more dynamic performance, optimally distributed and transmitted to the road by the four wheel drive for a level of stability and driveability that will appeal to all motoring enthusiasts.offering peace of mind, safety and driveability, four-wheel drive accentuates the vehicle’s dynamic character.a diesel engine still remains the most efficient and versatile choice to power any vehicle, - the electric motor takes over from the hdi diesel engine in phases of lower power demands, particularly when starting up or driving at low speed and decelerating (energy recovery).this successful crossover results from the hybridization of several motoring concepts: suv, saloon, compact mpv, coupé… added to this are the benefits of hybrid4, which in the present case and for the first time combines diesel and electric power to offer the perfect response to customer expectations: “ecological” four wheel drive, controlled power, a high level of safety, assured modularity and a new driving sensation, all within an environmentally responsible approach.by launching the world’s first full diesel hybrid vehicle, the 3008 hybrid4, peugeot will create a new type of vehicle in terms of freedom of use and driving enjoyment.the hdi diesel engine is linked to an electronically-controlled manual six-speed sequential gearbox: - its electronic control enables significant savings in fuel consumption, in automatic mode, compared to a traditional automatic gearbox or even a traditional manual gearbox, - it offers real driving enjoyment gained from the possibility of choosing the gear change mode at any time - manual or automatic - with the gear lever or via controls behind the steering wheel.peugeot’s choice of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising environmental demands with driving sensations not previously available in a hybrid vehicle.with their exceptional efficiency, hdi fap diesel engines - thermodynamically more efficient than a petrol engine and offering like-for-like fuel consumption of 30% less - are clearly the best internal combustion engine choice.this recovery system enables the driver to use “free” energy and reduce fuel consumption accordingly.in the medium term, this battery technology remains the most appropriate in terms of cost and industrialisation for vehicles produced in large volumes.since diesel engines consume less fuel than petrol engines, they are the ideal choice for this type of hybridization.the 3008 hybrid4 thus offers a new and highly technological approach to motoring, combining renewed driving enjoyment with a very low level of co2 emissions.
