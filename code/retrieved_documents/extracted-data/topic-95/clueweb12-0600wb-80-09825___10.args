already a leader in tertiary safety, peugeot’s objective for 2011 is to exceed 600,000 vehicles equipped with the emergency call equipment.
with two electric motors that give a combined output of 340 hp, four-wheel drive and an extremely aerodynamic and lightweight structure, ex1 is an out-of-the-ordinary two-seater roadster, designed for an intense driving experience.
peugeot is exhibiting a limited edition 508 rxh at frankfurt: the run of 300, individually-numbered examples in calern brown with alcantara leather upholstery can be pre-reserved online from the opening of the motor show.
in the first half of 2011, this dynamic approach has enabled peugeot to: - record 1,091,000 sales worldwide and to accelerate its internationalisation, - launch the 508 successfully in europe, then in china, - update its range at the heart of the market through the very favourable reception given to the new 308, - reduce the overall carbon footprint of its product range further, - accelerate the deployment of the highly-innovative and unique mu by peugeotmobility scheme.
so, due to its many mobile aerodynamic parts that were designed with speed in mind, the hx1’s unusual mpv architecture, very low for a length of 4.93 m, results in an exceptional cd of 0.28.

through its appealing styling, the impressive environmental credentials of its extensive range of engines and cutting-edge technology, along with its pleasant onboard surroundings and the driving experience it provides, the 508 (saloon or sw) offers a modern range at one with the aspirations of its dynamic, responsible and discerning customers.
the new peugeot cycles range, boasting more than 50 models, is tailored to wide-ranging requirements.
all-electric, practical and modern, intuitive and nippy; the e-vivacity offers a range of 60 km (37 miles) and an average energy cost of €0.4/100 km, thanks to its next generation compact lithium-ion batteries.
the same special care has played an integral role in the direction taken with the distinctive design of the 508 rxh interior, harmonising specific colours and natural materials.
- peugeot actively seeks to reduce the co2 emissions of its vehicle range: the average emissions of the marque’s models were measured in the first half of 2011 at 129.8 g/km co2 compared to 131.3 in 2010, therefore dropping below the 130 g/km limit set for 2015 by the european commission.
its four reverse-opening doors provide access to the interior of hx1, the marque’s vision of a high-end passenger compartment, which combines elegance and modernity, natural materials and ultra-high technological specification.
its visual signature is enhanced by its individual front end character, flared wings, daytime running lights signature and a new exclusive body colour.
the diesel-electric hybrid; a new level of driving pleasure illustrating the cross-platform, modular versatility of hybrid4 technology, the 508 rxh is, after the hybrid4 3008, the second of the marque’s models to receive the diesel-electric hybrid power plant.
but for peugeot, “electricity” can also mean “intensity”.
in the first half of 2011 the 508 and the new 308 launched the e-hdi innovative technology, the new generationstop & start system, which reduces fuel consumption by nearly 15% in urban drive cycle, prior to its deployment in the second half of the year on the 3008, the 5008 and partner (van and tepee).
so, due to its many mobile aerodynamic parts that were designed with speed in mind, the hx1’s unusual mpv architecture, very low for a length of 4.93 m, results in an exceptional cd of 0.28.
it offers its occupants an exceptional level of interior space, an innovative modular design with its original “4+2” configuration, and provides the driver with a driving position that can be adapted to suit driving conditions.
with a combined power output of 299 bhp from the 2.2 litre hdi engine driving the front wheels and the electric motor integrated into the rear axle, its diesel-electric hybrid drive train provides the functionality of hybrid4 technology such as four-wheel drive and the ‘all electric’ mode with an increased potential range of 30 km (18.6 miles) due to the “plug in” function.
- at frankfurt, peugeot is presenting its pan-european online services.
furthermore, due to its hybrid4 drive train, it offers a responsible and intelligent alternative vision.

hx1: multi-purpose concept car the hx1, making its worldwide début in frankfurt, is a concept for gauging interest which has a specification to seat up to six people in a vehicle with unconventional styling: robust, sporty, integrating the new brand identity, unparalleled aerodynamics, and providing a unique interior space and driving experience.
e-hdi combines the 1.6 l hdi euro 5 engine and a reversible-alternator which provides thestop & start system function, supplemented by a braking energy recovery system and hybrid battery that delivers additional power at start-up.
rising to this challenge, the designers have placed adaptability at the heart of their creation: the hx1 can metamorphose to suit its environment, the driving conditions and the expectations of its occupants.
with its wider track, its 18’’ wheels and raised attitude the 508 rxh has a natural stance that is inspired by its all-road capability.
at the peugeot stand in frankfurt, the e-vivacity scooter is another illustration of the marque’s response to new expectations in terms of “zero emissions” urban mobility.
available as an option or as standard on almost all range models, peugeot connect strengthens peugeot’s leading position in matters of tertiary safety.
