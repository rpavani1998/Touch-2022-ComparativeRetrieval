since gas stations offering b20 are few and far between, psnh has the biodiesel delivered to its area work centers by simply green, a biofuels company headquartered in portsmouth, nh, that offers on-site delivery.
"the hybrid bucket trucks, in particular, are relatively new to the market," said joseph.
a new kind of hybrid starting this fall, psnh will begin piloting a new emissions-reduction technology to reduce its transportation-related carbon footprint—gas/electric hybrid line trucks.
"the hybrid bucket trucks, in particular, are relatively new to the market," said joseph.
along with cutting fuel costs and consumption, the pilot project could help "prove" the hybrid technology to the broader marketplace.
" with the expanded program, joseph expects psnh's bucket truck fleet to use about 70,000 gallons of b20 in 2009, replacing more than 14,000 gallons of petroleum-based diesel with biofuel, and reducing carbon emissions by 113 tons.
this program could produce a fuel cost savings of more than $225,000 over 10 years, which would be passed along to psnh customers.
"in 2008, we used about 14,000 gallons of b20, reducing tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions by about 23 tons," said jay joseph, who manages psnh's transportation fleet.
as an additional benefit, the aerial units on the hybrid bucket trucks are able to operate off the onboard lithium-ion batteries—meaning that the truck's engine doesn't have to be running to perform certain roadside jobs, which also reduces noise pollution.

at that ratio, no engine modifications are needed to burn the fuel in regular diesel engines.
