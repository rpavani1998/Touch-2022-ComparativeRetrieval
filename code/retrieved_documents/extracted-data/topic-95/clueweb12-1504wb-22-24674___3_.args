this helps our environment and saves taxpayer money too.the process is called "hot in-place recycling" and it saves missourians millions of dollars every year.by recycling asphalt shingles, modot keeps them out of landfills, preserve petroleum resources and lower our construction costs while maintaining high quality asphalt pavement.it is processed using specialized equipment that scarifies it on the road while mixing in a rejuvenating agent.using the latest technology, modot can actually recycle entire asphalt roads.modot keeps billions of pounds of waste from landfills modot has recycled 3.56 billion pounds of industrial waste from mines, steel furnaces and power plants, as well as shingles and tires over these five years.modot recycles roads and bridges modot can actually reuse asphalt directly in place by heating it, processing it on the road and relaying it.beyond the cost savings, this practice also helps modot in its efforts to be environmentally responsible.shingle recycling also helps modot reduce the amount of petroleum it uses in its road construction program.modot uses more ethanol and biodiesel fuel a year - three million gallons of e-85 and b20 - than all other state agencies combined.modot can actually reuse asphalt directly in place by heating it, processing it on the road and relaying it.according to the missouri department of natural resources, an estimated 146,500 tons of roofing materials are disposed of in missouri landfills each year.that may not sound like much at first, but consider this: a typical resurfacing project would use about 30,000 tons of asphalt, for a savings of $90,000 to $150,000.by reusing tear-off shingles, the department reduces the amount that ends up in landfills.once the shingles have been processed, they are turned into materials for missouri roads beyond the cost savings, this practice also helps modot in its efforts to be environmentally responsible.
