with their exceptional efficiency, hdi diesel engines are thermodynamically more efficient than a petrol engine and offer a 30% reduction in fuel consumption.in this mode, the notion of “controlled power” comes into its own, coupling the diesel engine with the electric motor provides more dynamic performance, optimally distributed and transmitted to the road by the four wheel drive for a level of stability and driveability that will appeal to motoring enthusiasts.the performance of the hybrid4 is therefore directly comparable to that obtained with a single hdi diesel engine of a much higher capacity, with good levels of responsiveness backed by a real breakthrough in terms of reduced fuel consumption and co2 emissions (around 35 % less in the combined cycle for equivalent performance).peugeot’s choice of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising environmental demands with driving experiences not previously available in a hybrid vehicle.indeed, as well as the social benefit of the steep reduction in fuel consumption, the level of performance provided by this technology will delight even the most demanding customers in terms of road holding, responsiveness, driveability, peace of mind regardless of road conditions and the possibility of enjoying silent operation in town in the all-electric mode.combined with a raised and dominating driving position it has everything in place to reward its drivers and offer a range of new driving experiences not previously found in a conventional hybrid vehicle.a real breakthrough in terms of reducing fuel consumption and co2 emissions, while improving dynamic performance levels, providing four-wheel drive and an electric only mode, hybrid4 technology brings a number of benefits without compromises.this provides a number of advantages not only in terms of customer benefits and it also helps reduce costs and optimise the production process.it offers peace of mind, safety, improved driveability and accentuates the vehicle’s dynamic character.environmental friendliness with co2 emissions from 99g/km the peugeot 3008 hybrid4 is designed to appeal to demanding, technophile customers who are in search of a rewarding and original vehicle.in the medium term, this battery technology remains the most appropriate in terms of cost and industrialisation for vehicles produced in large volumes.with the peugeot 3008 equipped with hybrid4 technology, the aim is to appeal to customers who expect both environmental-friendliness and technological sophistication, and also genuine driving enjoyment.furthermore, the driveability, safety and eco-efficiency of the system are based on simple, reasonable and consistent technological choices.unlike previous hybrid vehicles which have chosen to use a less fuel efficient petrol engine, the peugeot 3008 hybrid4′s diesel engine provides superior combined drive cycle fuel consumption of 74.4mpg, and co2 emissions of 99g/km.these include a juke-box function, linked to a hard disc, peugeot connect services, gsm function, a usb connector, a dvd player, a bluetooth® system and a display which shows specific buildings in full 3d. the peugeot 3008 hybrid4 is a crossover with an exceptional technological content offering unique versatility and safety, unrivalled driving enjoyment and co2 emissions of a very low level.
