the new clean diesel fuel will enable advanced diesel emmissions systems to be employed and virtually eliminate all diesel nox and particulate emissions.diesel vehicles have certainly become cleaner over the years because of stronger emission standards, but they are still far from the cleanest vehicles on the road today.use of biodiesel significantly reduced emissions from diesel engines in and of itself.diesel fuel actually contains more energy per gallon than gasoline and producing each gallon of diesel requires 10- 25 percent more petroleum and results in 12-18 percent more heat-trapping gas emission than a gallon of gasoline—this takes a big chunk out of diesel’s commonly quoted benefits.diesel-hybrids are capable of 30-40% better mileage than gas-hybrids.providing incentives to only diesel vehicles, especially without adequate performance criteria for tailpipe pollutants, is a misguided approach and forces an unnecessary tradeoff between fuel economy and smog or toxic tailpipe emissions.also, without any form of petroleum tax, just increasing our efficiency will result initially in reducing demand, which will drop petroleum prices, making it more difficult to get the majority of the public to buy efficient vehicles, or use alternatives - so consumption will go back up.in the long run, the only way we can improve our economy (related to energy costs) will be to create a petroleum tax.but the structure of these standards will allow some vehicles to emit a lot more pollution than the average.the problems of continuing our petroleum dependence are so large, and will only get worse, that it should be considered an issue of extreme national importance - economically and strategically (and environmentally, although that's less of a concern to most people) - that it is justifiable to have a "sin tax" on petroleum, to encourage more efficient use, and use of alternatives.the right solution is to tax oil so that alternatives become much more desirable to the general public and remain competitive.diesels may produce more smog, but they can also run on biodiesel.in fact, the energy bill in the house could make this prospect a reality by encouraging the sale of diesels that emit as much as 10 times more smog forming pollutants than some of the hybrids already on the road.much like diesel technology, biodiesel has potential, but still has cost and compatibility issues, not to mention the fact that some are trying to pass 2% biodiesel (b2) mixed with regular diesel as a "green solution" where it really is not, and there is the factor of a 10% increase in nitrogen oxide emissions for 100% biodiesel (though you're talking about major reductions in carbon and soot).this vehicle emits about 44 times more smog-forming nitrogen oxide emissions and between 4 and 8 times more toxic diesel particulate emissions (that's soot, folks) than a comparable toyota corolla .
