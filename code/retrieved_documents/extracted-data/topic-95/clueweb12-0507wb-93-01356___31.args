1 year ago i leased the ml 450 hybrid .
so, the company developed a “shift” mode that controls the engine to simulate the behavior of an eight-speed automatic transmission.
in an odd transposition, the company’s amg tuning unit liked the looks of the humped hood so much that it is using that part on its high-performance versions of the ml as well.
like napoleon said, "i can do anything i want to, and some philosopher will justify it for me.
this is an inexcusably overweight, dangerous vehicle.
2 years ago i'm getting the mercedes ml series as i know the value of a cars safety in extreme accidents , head on, out of control at high speed, even collissions with semis.
still on original tires.
20 / 24 mpg 11.76 / 9.8 l/100km suv hybrid $55,000 2 years ago -if general motors came up with a revolutionary new "green" car that got 24 mpg epa max, people would be (rightly) condemning them.
notwithstanding, he tells me there are none in the country at this time but wanted me to test the diesel verson of which i am not interested.

that is great engineering.
sure, european vehicles may have more mechanical failiures than a japanese vehicle, but they are also at the very forefront of automotive technology and safety.
none of those components comes cheap, though mercedes-benz may have more leeway to charge higher prices than more mass-market big suvs like the chevy tahoe/gmc yukon twins.
if we all felt we "needed" to drive one, we would be spending even more of our capital on gas and oil.
mercedes does it, and our press gives them rave reviews.
but proud of its reputation for advanced technology in general, it has been hedging its bets with hybrids as well.
the idea of a transmission that shifts like a normal car when the driver is feeling sporty is an ingenious idea, for it simply uses technology to slightly tweak the behavior of the extremely complicated, yet well thought out transmission, in order to satisfy every customer that would consider owning a 335hp ml450h.
the new ml model, built in tuscaloosa, alabama, is fitted with the two-mode hybrid system jointly developed by general motors, daimler, chrysler, and bmw.
mb has been building higher mpg vehicles for a lot longer than gm even considered the idea of fuel mileage as a selling point.
