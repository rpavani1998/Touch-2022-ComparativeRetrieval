while diesels offer impressive fuel economy and have made improvements to their smog-forming emissions performance, efficient hybrids offer comparable (if not better) fuel economy, while still besting diesels on both the smog and global warming pollution fronts.like some of their hybrid counterparts they also offer impressive fuel economy compared to many conventional vehicles on the road.nevertheless, diesels can offer global warming and petroleum reduction benefits compared to their conventional gasoline counterparts.however, the exceedingly impressive tailpipe emissions and fuel economy performance of today’s most popular hybrids allow them to outperform their diesel counterparts.this reflects the benefits of hybridization in city driving and the strong fuel economy performance of diesel engines at sustained highway speeds.diesel fuel, in addition to containing more energy per gallon than gasoline, also has comparably higher carbon content.when comparing diesels and hybrids, consumers should just be aware that “performance” in the categories of air pollution, global warming pollution and oil dependence are not merely a function of the vehicle’s fuel economy, but rather also a function of its emissions control system and even of the fuel’s chemical makeup.conclusion environmentally speaking, today’s diesels are a significant improvement over their recent ancestors and can offer notable fuel economy improvements over conventional gasoline vehicles.on a full fuel cycle basis (that is, incorporating not only the emissions at the vehicle itself, but also the emissions related to the extraction, refining and transporting of the fuel from wellhead to pump), the burning of diesel fuel emits roughly 13 percent more co2 per gallon of fuel burned than does burning a gallon of gasoline.the civic hybrid emits an estimated 4.4 tons of co2-equivalent per year, while the jetta releases 6.4 tons per year, or approximately 45 percent more global warming emissions.air pollution all vehicles sold today are tested in a laboratory for tailpipe emissions and given a certification level — a grade, effectively — that specifies how clean the vehicle is in the emissions of four major pollutants: carbon monoxide (co), nitrogen oxides (nox), hydrocarbons, and particulate matter (pm).if a diesel vehicle consumes 25 percent less fuel than a gasoline powered vehicle, for example, its global warming benefit would in reality only be about 15 percent better than the gasoline vehicle.the carbon footprint provides an estimate of the annual greenhouse gas pollution, measure in carbon dioxide equivalents (co2-equivalent), from each vehicle model based on both the energy efficiency of the vehicle, the carbon content of the fuel being used, and driving 15,000 miles annually.while there are other secondary global warming pollution factors for autos, the pollution a vehicle puts into the atmosphere is largely proportional to the amount of fuel the vehicle burns.generally, the more fuel-efficient a vehicle is, the better it is from a global warming standpoint.
