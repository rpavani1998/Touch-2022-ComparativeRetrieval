the main advantage of batteries is that they can store more energy than double layer capacitors, but their power is more expensive and  they only last for up to 5000 duty cycles.
on the other hand, double layer  capacitors can give up to one million duty cycles.
another advantage of double  layer capacitors is high power density, while the disadvantage is limited  energy density which makes high energy applications very expensive.
