unlike japanese makers like toyota and honda, mercedes-benz is using hybrid technology to improve the mileage of its largest, heaviest vehicles—recognizing that upcoming gas-mileage regulations will hit its lineup disproportionately hard.like other hybrids, the two-mode can move the car at low speeds purely on electric power for short distances.according to hybrid control systems engineer konstantin neiss, using shift mode imposes about a 3-percent penalty on fuel economy.the idea of a transmission that shifts like a normal car when the driver is feeling sporty is an ingenious idea, for it simply uses technology to slightly tweak the behavior of the extremely complicated, yet well thought out transmission, in order to satisfy every customer that would consider owning a 335hp ml450h.this is an inexcusably overweight, dangerous vehicle.when looking at toyota and lexus' resumes you will see they have spent far more money repairing their faulty vehicles and paying damages to families who have been killed in their vehicles.with the diesel and hybrid ml variants competing head to head, industry analysts will eagerly be watching to see how much wealthy mercedes-benz buyers value various levels of mileage, whether hybrids prove more appealing than oil burners and, most importantly, at what price points.together, the complete powertrain delivers 335 horsepower and 381 foot-pounds of torque.it accelerates very well and has an incredibly short stopping distance from highway speed for such a heavy vehicle.even the interior trim on the a, b, and c pillars is designed to absorb and dissapate energy in case of an accident.drivetrain noise is all but imperceptible, and the sound damping (known as nvh by auto engineers, for noise-vibration-harshness) is exemplary.none of those components comes cheap, though mercedes-benz may have more leeway to charge higher prices than more mass-market big suvs like the chevy tahoe/gmc yukon twins.the ml450 sure sold me, i prefer the hybrid drive to the diesel, and most of my driving takes place in the city, therefore i achieve better gas mileage, a smoother, quieter ride, and when i'm stuck in stop and go traffic, i am burning zero fuel while keeping the a/c and all other electronics running.not to mention benz ups the ante with double redundant hood latches with spring tensioners, double firewall cowling with a full peripheral seal for the engine compartment to counter intrusion into the passenger compartment, a hardened steel front subframe, far more extensive use of ultra high-strength-low-alloy steel throughout, a thick energy absorbing foam under the feet of every passenger to minimize leg injury, 2 extra airbags, and an electronic stability program (utilizing the vehicles braking system, transmission, and traction control system) that is unrivaled by anyone.and benz uses liquid cooling to keep its pack healthy and the cells operating at best efficiency, complete with a “super chiller” to blast the pack with coolant when the electrical system is under stress—towing a trailer uphill in desert heat, for example.
