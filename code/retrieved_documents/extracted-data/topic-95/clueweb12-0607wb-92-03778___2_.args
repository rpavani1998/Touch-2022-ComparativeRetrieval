however, fuel savings between 6 and 13 percent would be an important step towards decreasing the co2 emissions from diesel-powered trains.reduced pollutant emissions and noise at stations can also achieved through the new concept, since it makes it possible to turn off the diesel engine during stops and use stored energy to power auxiliary systems.this hybrid energy storage system connected to the dmu propulsion system was tested for fuel consumption and performance and compared with a conventional dmu.the main advantage of batteries is that they can store more energy than double layer capacitors, but their power is more expensive and they only last for up to 5000 duty cycles.the hybrid energy storage system fits the requirements better in comparison with double layer capacitor or battery energy storage systems.one way is to implement a hybrid energy storage system that both could lower fuel consumption up to 13 percent and reduce harmful idling emissions(oct '11)related articles a new supercapacitor to improve power and efficiency and increase battery life of electric vehicles hydro-mechanical diesel multiple units (dmus), multiple unit trains powered by diesel engines, are needed in regional traffic.related articles a new supercapacitor to improve power and efficiency and increase battery life of electric vehicles progress in the development of rechargeable batteries through nanotechnology hydro-mechanical diesel multiple units (dmus), multiple unit trains powered by diesel engines, are needed in regional traffic.depending on the characteristics of tracks and parameters such as station distance and maximum speed, simulations suggested fuel savings from 6 to 13 percent, which makes theco2 emissions decrease by the same percentage.another advantage of double layer capacitors is high power density, while the disadvantage is limited energy density which makes high energy applications very expensive.one way is to implement a hybrid energy storage system that both could lower fuel consumption up to 13 percent and reduce harmful idling emissions(oct '11)at the institute of vehicle concepts in stuttgart, germany, researchers have developed anew hybrid hydro-mechanical dmu concept, including a hybrid energy storage systemmade up of batteries and double layer capacitors.however, they also found that a suitable cooling concept of the hybrid energy storages has to be developed, as well as a dependable method to determine the storages’ state of charge while in operation.country:  germany eco-friendly trains with hybrid energy storage researchers are investigating how to make diesel-powered trains more eco-friendly.this new hybrid hydro-mechanical dmu concept has a long way to go before being widely employed on tracks.when they compared these values with simulated values a good agreement was seen.
