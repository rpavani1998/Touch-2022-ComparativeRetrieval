no point in this one, 335i gets better performance.
waltz apparently revealed the location of the mine — reportedly deep in the superstition mountains — on his deathbed, but it has never been found.
but detroit and gas companies are blowing in the same pipe.
admittedly this model has none of the “clean” emission nonsense and uses no urea.
driver and passenger are likely to need refueling first.
there is absolutely no other engine capable of resist and endure hard work as a diesel engine.
if you do 40+ miles/day like us.
the ugly black fence snaking through the sand is a shock; after playing such a pivotal role in bringing down the berlin wall, it’s strangely unsettling to realize america is now one of the few places in the world — other than israel and korea — where you’ll now see a man-made barrier defining a national border.
the mission was founded in 1700, but the church, with its elaborately carved baroque façade, was not completed until almost 100 years later.
we did it for 3 times already.
after an early fish taco dinner at a roadside diner with a superb view of the 18 wheelers rumbling past, we drive down to the colorado river.
then again you have owned both so your post has more weight than mine:) great article.
it seems like it would be easier for them to refurbish them and reuse them on the same model of car.
sure diesels aren’t new by any means, but the cost effectiveness, infrastructure and public image just aren’t where they need to be to make them viable atm.
if only more people could see the light.
the engine output is identical to my 2006 e320 cdi, 369 foot pound torque and 201 bhp.
if more folks drove diesels the price of ulsd would go up temporarily until the refineries adjusted the gas/diesel output to reflect the higher demand.
the europeans on average are conserving much more fuel than all these tree nuts, 100%.
the border patrol guards check them carefully, then wave us on our way.
hybrids are better choices for folks that do mostly in-town driving but diesels excel on the highway.
i am not too hung up on the 425 tq since the car only makes 260hp.
just west of ocotillo, as i-8 climbs out of the desert, we spot what appears to be a ruined castle.
i liked the point the author made about diesel vehicles being a good alternative to hybrids on the highway.
after an early fish taco dinner at a roadside diner with a superb view of the 18 wheelers rumbling past, we drive down to the colorado river.
so much so that i’m still struggling to understand why, of all the programs cash-strapped gm had to cut, it chose to stop work on the new light duty 4.5-liter duramax v-8 diesel for the gmt900 pickups and suvs.
i don’t really understand why gm has given up on the light duty diesel idea.
the hybrid drive is probably just as expensive as a diesal & may not be as heavy duty.
clearly, diesel is way to go . . .
their petroleum products cost two to three times more.
i normally could care less about mpg, but this was better than i expected at nearly 24 in the city.
i always tell my friends that if they are going to use their car for short distance comute and park it most of the time buy a gasoline car, becouse you never get back the extra price of the engine, but if you have to put in a lot of miles buy a diesel, they are unbreakable and only need clean filters and fresh oil, no tune ups and not electrical parts to bother you!
we head along route 86, which loops down towards the mexican border and through the tohono o’odham nation before turning north to join i-8 at gila bend.
while a bmw isn’t exactly cheap and doesn’t make sense as a cost-saving fuel efficient vehicle… a jetta or golf diesel is brilliant.
i bought my 335d with the $4500 eco credit bmw offered and got the car for less than the equivalent 335i.
also, it is known fact that around 70% of all prius i (generation) cars had to replace batteries in order to stay hybrid.
after four days and 1304 miles on the road, the bmw 335d has averaged 32 mpg without any special eco-driving.
heavy duty vehicles benefit from the torque of a diesel, but so do light-duty vehicles.
you can read about the adventure of picking up the car at the bmw welt, the drives to lindau, berchtesgaden, roßfeld, and graz, and back to munich, at http://www.thedieseldriver.com i appreciate diesels , but some are a tough pill to swallow.
that assessment that millions of barrels could be sent back … is actually true but we do not know equation for that.
us tax structure does favor gas, but if you think the refineries are making hardly any money on gas today you need to check facts.
winding two-lane blacktop takes us up into the lost dutchman state park, named after a rich gold mine supposedly found by prussian immigrant jacob waltz in the 1870s.
the main benefit in that case would be range rather than lowering oil consumption.
it’s like other have mentioned above, the premium of some diesels compared to other models is just too much for people to bear.
white and green border patrol suvs lurk in the scrub, and we are stopped at a checkpoint.
unfortunately, bmw does not have 5-series in diesel.
this might be acompact car, but it’s capable of crossing a continent in giant leaps — based on our experience the 335d will easily go 515 miles between fuel stops.
“so what are you doing here?” says the polite border patrol officer after he’s checked our green cards, and had a look in the 335d’s trunk to make sure we weren’t transporting illegal immigrants.
diesel is way to go for now ntil we find better way of building and recycling batteries.
although i completely disagree with his hairstyle, mackenzie can certainly write an impressive article.
another 7,000 $ cost for “green owner”.
my loaded ’09 jetta tdi cost me 19.7k after dealer discounts, state sales tax exemption and federal tax credit.
; most of my driving is in the city and a hybrid is perfect for it.
with a good tuning box and sawn-off catalytic converter it can hit 250 bhp and 425 foot pound of torque.
the 335d takes on 12.7 gallons of diesel next morning in scottsdale, which means we’ve averaged 31.8 mpg for the 404 miles from l.a.

gm could have offer the duramax in their large suvs… come in handy for suburban owners, have cylinder deactivation &
people always think about the inicial cost and the cost of repair, but let me tell you that i drove a 1985 toyota cressida as taxi for 20 years and after the car finished its working years my father kept the car for personal use.
the car has 369 foot pound out of the box!
volkswagen finds highest mileage vw diesel in us volkswagen passat bluemotion diesel set for geneva gm obtains 50 percent stake in diesel engine manufacturer would you want a vw rabbit diesel hybrid that gets 69 mpg?
in miami we still have a 1/4 of tank.
non-food bio-diesal has great protential though.
now as for refining process, you could argue that we could get less diesel than regular gas … but remants of the refining process are by far checmically better then after refining the same oil into gas alone.
but europe’s ancient cities are perpetually jammed with diesels idling at traffic lights, while here in america you regularly see hybrids being hustled along freeways at 70-80 mph, their electric motors virtually useless.

it’s sunday, and the parking lot is filling up with pickup trucks.
the north-bound i-15 hits 4190 feet as it crests cajon pass en route to barstow and the junction with i-40, which will take us west to phoenix.
plus w di i4s in mid-size sedans w light weight construction they will soon get ~35mpg highway (which is enough for most americans) & near v6 performance (plenty)..
yuma also proved diesel fuel is more consistently priced in arizona than gas.
i look around, trying to spot the border patrol.
anyone who’d buy a hybrid over one of those is clearly someone who’d rather ignore the facts and chase an image.
just west of ocotillo, as i-8 climbs out of the desert, we spot what appears to be a ruined castle.
no more chronic high pressure fuel pump issues stranding the car or causing long starts(which my ex-335i suffered from), i enjoy diesel prices that are cheaper than regular in ca, much smoother throttle tip in, lower co2 emissions and 425lb/ft of torquey thrust that makes the car feel faster than the 335i in most situations.
miles in a bmw 335d written by: angus mackenzie on january 25 2010 6:11 pm america and europe might have this whole hybrid/diesel thing the wrong way round.
on the oher side, here in usa, the only recycling battery facility burned to ground few months ago.
pity it is killed by californian tree-huggers.
the 335d eats it up, the crisp steering and buttoned-down chassis making light work of the constant changes of direction.
after a legally-resident german-born photo assistant working for one of our freelance photographers was held in a cell for almost two hours at a border patrol checkpoint near the salton sea a few years back because he didn’t have his passport on him, mrs. mackenzie (a brit) and i (an australian) never travel anywhere in the us without our green cards.
it is impressive mileage..
diesal is like oil (thicker) so i suspected it took more oil to make a gallon hence the higher energy content.
maybe gm product planners don’t believe diesel has a future in america; maybe they’re worried people won’t pay a premium for a diesel engine while gas prices remain low (though we have found places where diesel is cheaper than regular gas).
the border patrol guards check them carefully, then wave us on our way.
the petroleum savings more than made up for the nox emissions.
diesels, on the other hand, like cruising at constant velocities, where their highly efficient combustion process allows them to extract the maximum energy out of every gallon of fuel.
diesal may not be that good an idea even for full size trucks/suvs except for those that need to big torque for heavy hauling.
in gl we can go from atlanta to miami w/o any need to refuel. . .
if we pay “cheap” for our gasoline here in the states, imagine how little we’ll pay for diesel if demand grows great article.
with 425 lb-ft of torque on tap between 1750 and 2250 rpm, the 335d cruises effortlessly up the freeway as it sweeps across the face of the san gabriel mountains, the 3.0-liter diesel barely breaking a sweat as we pass laboring semis.
that’s better than even the polo tdi sold in europe.
we take it easy, wary of damaging the 335d’s low profile tires on the occasional rocky outcrops.
the point-and-squirt running on the apache trail takes its toll — our fuel consumption for today’s 226-mile leg has dropped to 29 mpg.
at the same time, the performance was startlingly good and i didn’t have to drive it gingerly for such a decent return in fuel economy.
just like we buy their excess gasoline.
the only setback was the city mileage (13 mpg).
but europe’s ancient cities are perpetually jammed with diesels idling at traffic lights, while here in america you regularly see hybrids being hustled along freeways at 70-80 mph, their electric motors virtually useless.
diesel fuel is very comparable to premium unleaded (which would go into a regular 335) so you would still get the benefit of the superior mpg even with diesel fuel increases.
this might be acompact car, but it’s capable of crossing a continent in giant leaps — based on our experience the 335d will easily go 515 miles between fuel stops.
using the 335d’s sat nav map, we drive down a road that looks to end right at the river’s edge.
if i had to guess, i think it is viewed that if it is too much of a success, it would completely kill their efforts with the 2-mode hybrid system.
the river slides by in the darkness below us; on the other side are lights in the distance.
we take the long way to tucson, looping out and around the scenic apache trail.
it will run out soon though and the 335i is now coming with incentives.
we have 2 diesels ’08 mb gl320 cdi and ’10 jetta sport wagon tdi.
the point-and-squirt running on the apache trail takes its toll — our fuel consumption for today’s 226-mile leg has dropped to 29 mpg.
we live 2 months a year in palermo, italy where 83% of the cars are diesel.
“so what are you doing here?” says the polite border patrol officer after he’s checked our green cards, and had a look in the 335d’s trunk to make sure we weren’t transporting illegal immigrants.
it’s a good car, but this is an apples & oranges comparison.
the diesel smell of yore is gone, a good thing since a/c is very rare in the “average” car (mazda 2, hyundai getz or atos, ford fiesta [now there is a cool looking car], fiat bravo [there's another] or cinquecento).
so no need to spend the extra cost on building a diesal motor for small to mid-size cars here.
start with exxon’s profits the last two years.
you can not forced them to do.
i sit right on the speed limit as the lights slowly get closer.
if i had the $$ for a 335d i’d trade in my ’09 jetta tdi in a heartbeat.
we have a chevy matiz, and gm is way behind, by the way.
as far as hybrid vs diesel in mileage, there’s a whole bunch of guys driving vw tdis that get similar or better mileage when compared to the prius and those cars aren’t underpowered.
the ugly black fence snaking through the sand is a shock; after playing such a pivotal role in bringing down the berlin wall, it’s strangely unsettling to realize america is now one of the few places in the world — other than israel and korea — where you’ll now see a man-made barrier defining a national border.
this is a land where the capability and functionality of a full-size pickup or suv makes a lot of sense.
the southwest doesn’t get much more authentic than this.
sure the prius gets the better mileage, but it’s the price premium that takes close to 90,000 miles to over come that most people don’t take into consideration.
with 425 lb-ft of torque on tap between 1750 and 2250 rpm, the 335d cruises effortlessly up the freeway as it sweeps across the face of the san gabriel mountains, the 3.0-liter diesel barely breaking a sweat as we pass laboring semis.
your interior room comparison didn’t make sense.
one point missed is that diesels idle dead lean, while even dfi cars have to be slightly enriched, and all others much enriched.
i think the biggest issues facing diesels are the same with any alternative power source.
once of the pass, we loaf through the high desert, the engine turning a relaxed 2000 rpm at 80 mph.
plus small turbo i4s will get 40 mpg city w increased performance over a larger normally aspirated motor.
jetta on the other hand, can not go below 38 mpg no matter how i drive it.
start/stop feature to increase mpg even more.
plus the refineries are already setup for gas & they don’t make hardly anything on gas these days and would probably not want to invest the money to convert… right now diesal is in limited supply in the us & increased demand would only drive the price higher.
they make good low end torque.
we’ve paid $2.69 a gallon for each of the last three tanks, while regular gas has varied from $2.23 to $2.49 a gallon and premium from $2.53 to $2.75 a gallon.
the hpfp issue is a biggie though, and could win many a 3 series fan to the 335d.
your fuel costs should rise then you may discover hi, i am from costa rica and i am a taxi driver, i have been driving for 25 years and my experience with diesel engines is very high.
it’d probably be more fuel efficient than my 6 cylinder, 5 speed 4wd tundra is (crappy performance, but 21-22 mpg).

did not believe in diesel until i got one!!!
you see, hybrids liketoyota’s prius or ford’s fusion do the best work in stop-start city driving, where their gas engines shut down at traffic lights, and their electric motors ease them up to speed again.
mrs. mackenzie wants a glimpse of mexico, even though it’s dark.
you are correct about the diesel hybrid being the most efficient.
and to my recollection, the engineering was done, the manufacturing plant selection was done, it basically just needed a green light from headquarters.
yeah, we know… the 358-mile tucson-to-yuma leg has returned our best mileage so far — an average of 34.1 mpg.
white and green border patrol suvs lurk in the scrub, and we are stopped at a checkpoint.
so much so that i’m still struggling to understand why, of all the programs cash-strapped gm had to cut, it chose to stop work on the new light duty 4.5-liter duramax v-8 diesel for the gmt900 pickups and suvs.

using the 335d’s sat nav map, we drive down a road that looks to end right at the river’s edge.
whenever we see hybrids vehicle, nobody but nobody is saying what is or should be recycling policy for all those batteries.
yeah, we know… the 358-mile tucson-to-yuma leg has returned our best mileage so far — an average of 34.1 mpg.
so actually the 25% gain is gas mileage would be offset by the increased price of diesal (about 18% more around here) in the us so drivers wouldn’t save that much in fuel costs… not enough to pay for the diesal motor.
although, coal/nuclear/electric vehicles could change this dynamic fairly soon.
the reality is that from a barrel of oil, using any refining process, we can get twice as much of gas then diesel fuel.
the cost savings on the diesel fuel are wiped out by the premium you pay on the onset.
hybrid drivetrains are just as much if not more expensive than diesels, (and much more complex) even accounting for the expensive exhaust treatment required to satisfy the epa’s ridiculous regulations.
i believe there is a concept called time valu of money, a dollar spent now is worth more than a dollar spent in the future.
i’m sure a gmc yukon or cadillac escalade buyers would appreciate a clean-diesal option & be willing to pay 3-7k more rather than get the hybrid w battery that may need to be replaced.
the road curls around rugged rock formations and loops between giant saguaro cacti.
yuma also proved diesel fuel is more consistently priced in arizona than gas.
before that we had all kind of cars raging from honda/toyota to porsche cayenne.
think about what crisis we could face 15-20 years from now when all those batteries go bad.
so sorry, good article but fails to state the obvious, you are better off in a 335i no matter which way you look at it.
agree with angus about how suitable are hybrids for city driving.
i think a diesal hybrid would be expensive to build, but that would be the most efficient hybrid.
when you factor in the cost of batteries and the negative impact caused by the heavy metals in the batteries, diesel can often be a superior investment to environment conscience buyers.

diesel engine is the way to go.
but many of the pickup truck base motors run on e85 now, & many locals in the midwest where pickups are particularly useful & e85 readily available like to support the local energy industry/economy.

it would be nice to see a diesel vs gasoline smackdown test.
winding two-lane blacktop takes us up into the lost dutchman state park, named after a rich gold mine supposedly found by prussian immigrant jacob waltz in the 1870s.
the us tax structure favors gas.
it doesn’t matter which road you take out of l.a.: you have to climb up and over some fairly serious hills.
had detroit had decent diesel engines they would use it in usa as well.
i barely even considered the jetta tdi because of the extra cost and my prior experiences with diesels.
the diesal’s mpg doesn’t even come close to the real world mileage of a prius in 90% of driving conditions.
makes alot of sense for heavy duty vehicles in particular where a 25% gain in mpg can mean thousand of $ in savings.
it doesn’t matter which road you take out of l.a.: you have to climb up and over some fairly serious hills.
i do mostly city driving.
with really careful driving mixed mileage was 16 mpg.
the river slides by in the darkness below us; on the other side are lights in the distance.
we need diesels and hybrid/diesels in the u.s. there is a whole market being missed by so many people who don’t sit in traffic all day all around the country.
you see, hybrids liketoyota’s prius or ford’s fusion do the best work in stop-start city driving, where their gas engines shut down at traffic lights, and their electric motors ease them up to speed again.
diesels, on the other hand, like cruising at constant velocities, where their highly efficient combustion process allows them to extract the maximum energy out of every gallon of fuel.
i see smaller cars in the usa but they still have large engines, what for?
they took assessment done by transportation authorities and convert it into that spot.
the 335d takes on 12.7 gallons of diesel next morning in scottsdale, which means we’ve averaged 31.8 mpg for the 404 miles from l.a.
board computer never shows average speed below 73 mph!!!
the road curls around rugged rock formations and loops between giant saguaro cacti.
that, and 600+ miles per tank will convert many a 335i driver on a test drive, i think.
if only bmw put it in the 3 series or 5 series wagons for the us market… @pjphughes you are right, i had not considered the eco credit.
vw is working on one that has gotten 69mpg in real-world conditions.
we take it easy, wary of damaging the 335d’s low profile tires on the occasional rocky outcrops.
e39m, not sure what you mean about “chasing an image”, but i bought my hybrid for economical reasons
looking to give a jetta to my kids and i would buy new or used mb e class diesel or bmw.
the old cressida has 875000 miles ( 1400000 km ) with the original engine without any mayor repair!
folks that bash diesels probably have never driven one, i’d guess.
i also do mostly city driving (95%).
no, it’s not a 45mpg golf tdi, but i bought it for a combination of performance and efficiency.
it is known that insane dude inventor nicola tesla (yes company in ca is took his name) drove vehicle in 30′ last century from chicago to new york based on earth magnetic field!!!
todays smaller engines will do the same job as well and for much more mpg, the world i guess will still have to wait for the usa to find this out.
we take the long way to tucson, looping out and around the scenic apache trail.
it’d be the easiest sale a bmw salesman ever made.
the 335i makes 300hp so although you might get to 260hp fast, the 335i gets to 300hp pretty fast as well.
increased demand for diesel here would raise the price temporarily until the refineries adjusted their gas/diesel output % to accomodate.
we head along route 86, which loops down towards the mexican border and through the tohono o’odham nation before turning north to join i-8 at gila bend.
this car is way more fun to drive than my 335i.
not that i’m against clean air, but the way they’ve gone about regulating diesel emissions is absurd.
this is a land where the capability and functionality of a full-size pickup or suv makes a lot of sense.
in the u.s., i drive an 80′s diesel mercedes as my “in town” car and won’t be happy when it dies someday, but know i’ll get a cleaner car with 50% better milage in what ever used mercedes i buy then.
the real winner coming to the usa is the mercedes benz c250 cdi with manual transmission (available right now in the uk and europe).
we just drove 1348 km in a brand new bmw 335d picked up through bmw’s european delivery program in munich.
there are even picture of that vehicle … that is fact that few know … rumor is that ford apparently bought the patent and holds it for future.
i was given a 335d as a loaner when i brought my m5 in for service and i thought it was terrific.
waltz apparently revealed the location of the mine — reportedly deep in the superstition mountains — on his deathbed, but it has never been found.
mrs. mackenzie wants a glimpse of mexico, even though it’s dark.
as far as small cars a diesal cannot give the mileage of a dual-mode hybrid such as a prius while provide the same interior room.
the open two-lane is empty and diesel six growls quietly in the background as the blue bmw crosses the vast landscape.
after four days and 1304 miles on the road, the bmw 335d has averaged 32 mpg without any special eco-driving.
@j85968 audi did not come up by themselves and made that commercial.
my car’s engine is 6 cylinder and 3.2 liter and the new diesel is 2.2 liters, 4 cylinder with twin turbos.
we’ve paid $2.69 a gallon for each of the last three tanks, while regular gas has varied from $2.23 to $2.49 a gallon and premium from $2.53 to $2.75 a gallon.
i don’t think gm, ford, fiat, or toyota could sustain truck sales at current levels if they had to add $3-7000 (about 15-33% of msrp) to the base half-ton truck to replace the base engine with a 2010 emissions-compliant diesel.
but i bet you in few years from now, somebody will come with that process and make bil$ since supplies pf lithium are either limited or very expensive.
