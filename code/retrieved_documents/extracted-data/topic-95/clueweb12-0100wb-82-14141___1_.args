methanol is much less flammable than petrol and this has limited its use as fuel for internal combustion engines.sources of biofuels include sugar cane/beet, a range of vegetable oils, algae, animal fats and sewage.ethanol contains about 27% less energy than petrol (84,000 btus per us gallon compared to 115,000 btus for petrol).subject to the suitability of the engine it can be used as an alternative to, or blended with, unleaded petrol.methanol contains about 45% less energy than petrol (63,000 btus per us gallon compared to 115,000 btus for petrol).3.2.2   biodiesel biodiesel can be produced from any fat or oil using a process called “transesterification”.it is currently mainly manufactured from vegetable oils and has an energy content that is about 10% lower than that of petroleum diesel.methanol is corrosive to certain metals, including aluminium.biodiesel can be used as b100 or blended with petroleum diesel in most modern diesel engines.it is currently (2007) more cost effective to derive methanol from the natural gas methane.ethanol, with water content of not more than 1%, can be blended with petrol in varying ratios.the car has a maximum range of 341 miles (546 km) when running on petrol or 62 miles (99 km) when running on hydrogen.note: ethanol can also be produced from other sources, such as petroleum and coal.fuel economy is expected to improve significantly as higher compression engines designed to run only on e100 become available.- steam reforming, mainly from natural gas, is currently the most cost effective and hence the most popular method.
