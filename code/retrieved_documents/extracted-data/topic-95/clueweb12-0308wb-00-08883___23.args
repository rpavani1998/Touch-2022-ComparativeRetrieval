hybrid4 technology brings together peugeot’s best technologies and experience: hdi diesel engines, electric vehicle knowledge, second-generation stop & start and electronically-controlled sequential manual gearboxes.
in this mode, the notion of “controlled power” comes into its own, coupling the diesel engine with the electric motor provides more dynamic performance, optimally distributed and transmitted to the road by the four wheel drive for a level of stability and driveability that will appeal to motoring enthusiasts.
the electric motor and its ancillary equipment (inverter, converter, etc) are fitted at the rear of the vehicle.
on the peugeot 3008 hybrid4 all these components have been made as compact as possible to optimise the installation and weight effect in the vehicle.
the combination of a fuel efficient 2.0 litre 163 bhp hdi diesel engine and a 37 bhp electric motor is the optimal combination for a hybrid vehicle.
unlike previous hybrid vehicles which have chosen to use a less fuel efficient petrol engine, the peugeot 3008 hybrid4′s diesel engine provides superior combined drive cycle fuel consumption of 74.4mpg, and co2 emissions of 99g/km.
the peugeot 3008 hybrid4 can also be transformed to offer a considerable load capacity under the parcel shelf of 420 litres (362 dm3 vda), with 66 litres (29 dm3 vda) available under the boot floor.

the two power sources also complement each other in certain driving conditions (“boost” effect during hard acceleration, or when overtaking another vehicle, for example).
it also leaves intact the possibility of using a range of different capacity engines, for possible future introduction.
changeover from the hdi diesel engine to the electric motor occurs automatically, due to a stop & start system which places the hdi diesel engine in standby and restarts it as and when conditions require (the operation of the accelerator pedal, low battery charge level, etc…).
the choice of hybrid architecture was also guided by the search for optimal efficiency and consistency.

based on the manufacturer’s technical specifications, bosch has provided its expertise with respect to the electric motor, the power electronics, the reversible high-voltage alternator / generator and other systems managing the dialogue between these components, the braking and trajectory correction systems (abs and esp).
activation of the hdi diesel engine is programmed to coincide with only more sustained phases of acceleration.
the performance of the hybrid4 is therefore directly comparable to that obtained with a single hdi diesel engine of a much higher capacity, with good levels of responsiveness backed by a real breakthrough in terms of reduced fuel consumption and co2 emissions (around 35 % less in the combined cycle for equivalent performance).
