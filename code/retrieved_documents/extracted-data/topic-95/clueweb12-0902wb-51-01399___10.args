thus, from an oil security standpoint, merely examining the fuel economy of a diesel vehicle doesn’t capture the full picture.
comparing the environmental performance of diesels and hybrids miles per gallon (mpg): the mpg ratings for the civic hybrid are about 13% better than the diesel jetta in highway driving (45 versus 40 mpg) and 38% better in city driving (40 versus 29).

the carbon footprint provides an estimate of the annual greenhouse gas pollution, measure in carbon dioxide equivalents (co2-equivalent), from each vehicle model based on both the energy efficiency of the vehicle, the carbon content of the fuel being used, and driving 15,000 miles annually.
while there are other secondary global warming pollution factors for autos, the pollution a vehicle puts into the atmosphere is largely proportional to the amount of fuel the vehicle burns.
air pollution: epa also provides a similar score for comparing vehicles based on air pollution emissions.
as we’ll see shortly, however, the impressive fuel economy numbers of diesels don’t tell the whole story when it comes to assessing other attributes such as global warming, or oil dependence performance, or air pollution.
air pollution all vehicles sold today are tested in a laboratory for tailpipe emissions and given a certification level — a grade, effectively — that specifies how clean the vehicle is in the emissions of four major pollutants: carbon monoxide (co), nitrogen oxides (nox), hydrocarbons, and particulate matter (pm).
the civic hybrid emits an estimated 4.4 tons of co2-equivalent per year, while the jetta releases 6.4 tons per year, or approximately 45 percent more global warming emissions.
using our previous example, a diesel vehicle that consumes 25 percent less fuel than a gasoline-powered vehicle would, in fact, consume only 15 percent less crude oil than the gasoline vehicle.

diesels achieve higher mpgs (miles per gallon) due to two main factors.

global warming pollution: the mpg values help you determine how far you can go on a gallon of fuel, but more information is needed to accurately determine the global warming impact of a vehicle.
in short, hybrids still carry the day.
however, the exceedingly impressive tailpipe emissions and fuel economy performance of today’s most popular hybrids allow them to outperform their diesel counterparts.
the bin 2 certification earns the civic hybrid a 9 on epa’s air pollution score, while the diesel jetta’s bin 5 certification earns it a middle-of-the-road score of 6.
comparing the global warming emissions per mile, or carbon footprint, allows a direct comparison between two vehicles, while the epa greenhouse gas score shows how a vehicle relates to the rest of the fleet.

second is the fact that on a per-gallon basis, diesel fuel contains about 13 percent more energy than gasoline.
when comparing diesels and hybrids, consumers should just be aware that “performance” in the categories of air pollution, global warming pollution and oil dependence are not merely a function of the vehicle’s fuel economy, but rather also a function of its emissions control system and even of the fuel’s chemical makeup.
in short, hybrids still carry the day.
epa-doe website www.fueleconomy.gov includes annual carbon footprint estimates, as well as annual crude oil consumption estimates and air pollution scores for every make and model on its site, allowing you to compare gasoline, diesel, and hybrid-electric vehicles side by side.
this reflects the benefits of hybridization in city driving and the strong fuel economy performance of diesel engines at sustained highway speeds.

while there are other secondary global warming pollution factors for autos, the pollution a vehicle puts into the atmosphere is largely proportional to the amount of fuel the vehicle burns.
diesel fuel, in addition to containing more energy per gallon than gasoline, also has comparably higher carbon content.
the ghg score ranks all vehicles on a scale of 1 to 10.
most of today’s hybrids and even some conventional gasoline vehicles are considerably cleaner, certified to “bin 3,” “bin 2,” (the lower the bin number, the better for the environment) and even the near-zero-emission california “pzev” certification.
let’s dig in… under the hood: diesel fuel economy one of the biggest draws of diesel technology is their impressive fuel economy.
overall, the hybrid civic (42 mpg) out-performs the diesel jetta (33 mpg) in combined city and highway fuel economy by 27 percent.
it should be noted that a vehicle’s fuel economy is highly dependent on manufacturers design decisions.
the carbon footprint provides an estimate of the annual greenhouse gas pollution, measure in carbon dioxide equivalents (co2-equivalent), from each vehicle model based on both the energy efficiency of the vehicle, the carbon content of the fuel being used, and driving 15,000 miles annually.

on a full fuel cycle basis (that is, incorporating not only the emissions at the vehicle itself, but also the emissions related to the extraction, refining and transporting of the fuel from wellhead to pump), the burning of diesel fuel emits roughly 13 percent more co2 per gallon of fuel burned than does burning a gallon of gasoline.

note, there are no diesel and hybrid models that allow for a pure apples-to-apples comparison on every major attribute; we chose these models for their popularity and market comparability.
for example, the diesel jetta could have a better mpg, but the vehicle designers chose to achieve higher acceleration rather than better fuel economy.
additional resources for vehicle comparisons the hybridcenter.org comparison chart provides comparison of different hybrid models and their non-hybrid counterparts.
oil dependence: comparison of petroleum consumption estimates show that the diesel jetta consumes about 45 percent more petroleum than the civic hybrid.
conclusion environmentally speaking, today’s diesels are a significant improvement over their recent ancestors and can offer notable fuel economy improvements over conventional gasoline vehicles.

while diesels offer impressive fuel economy and have made improvements to their smog-forming emissions performance, efficient hybrids offer comparable (if not better) fuel economy, while still besting diesels on both the smog and global warming pollution fronts.
meeting the “bin 5” standard is a significant achievement for diesels which, because of the diesel combustion process, produces high levels of nox and pm in the engine cylinders.
