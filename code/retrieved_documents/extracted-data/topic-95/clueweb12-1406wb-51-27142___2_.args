the combination of modern clean diesel engines, prius-style serial hybrid-electric systems, and biodiesel/vegetable oil fuels could provide amazing mileage, cleaner air, and vastly reduced petroleum dependency.diesel engines are much simpler than gasoline engines, will burn about anything, and use standard fuels which require much less refining than gasoline, and are safer to store and transport.bio-diesel could forstall the ever depleating oil reserves said to be overwelmed by demand by 2016.but modern diesel engine design coupled with the much-cleaner types of diesel fuel increasingly available (particularly "biodiesel") make diesel vehicles a surprisingly environmentally-friendly choice.diesel hybrids turned out to be much better than gasoline/gasoline-hybrid cars, and highly competitive with the best hydrogen fuel cell systems (even assuming optimistic fuel cell vehicle development).the production of biodiesel in large enough quantities to sustain a transportation network would certainly involve agribusiness.biodiesel is synthesized entirely from plants -- usually soy in the us, and canola/rapeseed in europe -- and is therefore carbon-neutral: the soy/canola grown to create biodiesel pulls from the air the same amount of carbon the eventual combustion produces.in the us, the diesel fuel available in most locations remains the old, dirty, high-sulfur variety, so a hybrid diesel actually wouldn't be a significant improvement in emissions; once low-sulfur regulations take effect in 2006, this may change.diesels operate most effeciently when run at a constant rpm and in a given temp range, both of which fit the hybrid model very well.combining the power of diesel engines with the efficiency of hybrid technologies can have terrific payoffs.the irony is that diesel hybrids could be far more efficient and clean than anything now on the market, without any leaps in technology.this is one way that hybrid technology could really show its strengths: a hybrid-svo could warm up the svo with an electric heater while running on batteries at lower speeds, much like the current prius does.rider a biodiesel-based, ultra-efficient hybrid-diesel automobile & transportation system would give a putative hydrogen economy a serious challenge, especially since the infrastructure changes required are far less dramatic, the necessary technology far less speculative, and the severence of ties to petroleum nations and industries far more complete.studies by the australian government show a significant reduction in harmful emissions with ulsd.companies like asda in the uk are already using chicken fat from their cooked chickens to fuel their trucks, thereby saving money and tax, and helping the environment.
