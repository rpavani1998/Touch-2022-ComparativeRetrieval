generally, the more fuel-efficient a vehicle  is, the better it is from a global warming standpoint.
epa ghg score: while the diesel jetta might appear to be a global warming laggard based on the previous comparison, the epa ghg score puts these emissions into a broader context.
when comparing diesels and hybrids, consumers should just be aware that “performance” in the categories of air pollution, global warming pollution and oil dependence are not merely a function of the vehicle’s fuel economy, but rather also a function of its emissions control system and even of the fuel’s chemical makeup.
comparing the environmental performance of diesels and hybrids miles per gallon (mpg): the mpg ratings for the civic  hybrid are about 13% better than the diesel jetta in highway driving (45 versus  40 mpg) and 38% better in city driving (40 versus 29).
so how do today’s diesels fare compared to today’s most popular hybrids?
air pollution: epa also provides a similar score for  comparing vehicles based on air pollution emissions.
u.s. interest in diesel engines for passenger vehicles has seen a recent resurgence, in part because of creative automotive engineering.
the ghg score ranks all vehicles on a  scale of 1 to 10.
note, there are no diesel and hybrid  models that allow for a pure apples-to-apples comparison on every major  attribute; we chose these models for their popularity and market comparability.
air pollution: epa also provides a similar score for comparing vehicles based on air pollution emissions.
this characteristic of diesel fuel is why using a fuel economy comparison between gasoline and diesel vehicles to determine global warming benefits can be misleading.
while there are other secondary global warming pollution factors for autos, the pollution a vehicle puts into the atmosphere is largely proportional to the amount of fuel the vehicle burns.
if a diesel vehicle consumes 25 percent less fuel than a gasoline  powered vehicle, for example, its global warming benefit would in reality only  be about 15 percent better than the gasoline vehicle.
thus, from an oil security standpoint, merely examining the fuel economy of a diesel vehicle doesn’t capture the full picture.
in an environment where american consumers are increasingly more concerned  about the ecological, economic, and energy-related impacts of their travel,  hybrid vehicles have garnered the lion’s share of recent attention as a  near-term solution to those challenges.
according to the joint u.s. epa-doe website,www.fueleconomy.gov, approximately  13 percent more crude oil is required to produce a gallon of diesel fuel than  to produce a gallon of gasoline.
conclusion environmentally speaking, today’s  diesels are a significant improvement over their recent ancestors and can offer  notable fuel economy improvements over conventional gasoline vehicles.
oil dependence: comparison of petroleum consumption  estimates show that the diesel jetta consumes about 45 percent more petroleum  than the civic hybrid.
on a full fuel cycle basis (that is, incorporating not only the emissions at the vehicle itself, but also the emissions related to the extraction, refining and transporting of the fuel from wellhead to pump), the burning of diesel fuel emits roughly 13 percent more co2 per gallon of fuel burned than does burning a gallon of gasoline.
*   thus, from an oil security  standpoint, merely examining the fuel economy of a diesel vehicle doesn’t  capture the full picture.
comparing the global warming emissions per mile, or carbon footprint, allows a  direct comparison between two vehicles, while the epa greenhouse gas score  shows how a vehicle relates to the rest of the fleet.
today’s “clean diesels” are certified to meet what’s known as the federal “tier 2 bin 5” emissions standard, along with an equivalent standard in california commonly known as “lev ii”.

according to the joint u.s. epa-doe website,www.fueleconomy.gov, approximately 13 percent more crude oil is required to produce a gallon of diesel fuel than to produce a gallon of gasoline.
this reflects the  benefits of hybridization in city driving and the strong fuel economy  performance of diesel engines at sustained highway speeds.
epa-doe website www.fueleconomy.gov includes annual carbon footprint  estimates, as well as annual crude oil consumption estimates and air pollution  scores for every make and model on its site, allowing you to compare gasoline,  diesel, and hybrid-electric vehicles side by side.
like some of their hybrid counterparts they  also offer impressive fuel economy compared to many conventional vehicles on  the road.
diesel fuel, in addition to containing more energy per gallon than gasoline, also has comparably higher carbon content.
below is  a sample comparison between two similar vehicles, one diesel and one a gasoline  hybrid, that illustrates this point.

such information has prompted some to speculate about whether today’s diesels might be deserving of the eco-friendly mantle currently held by efficient hybrids like the toyota prius and honda civic hybrid.
while diesels offer impressive fuel economy  and have made improvements to their smog-forming emissions performance,  efficient hybrids offer comparable (if not better) fuel economy, while still  besting diesels on both the smog and global warming pollution fronts.

different  fuels have unique concentrations of carbon, in a similar way that, say,  different types of soda contain different amounts of sugar.

first, the compression ignition combustion process that occurs inside diesel engine cylinders is more efficient than the spark ignition process that occurs in gasoline engine cylinders, wasting less energy as the fuel is converted into mechanical motion.
