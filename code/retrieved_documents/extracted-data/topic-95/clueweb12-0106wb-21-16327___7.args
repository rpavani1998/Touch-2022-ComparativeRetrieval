more than 3.000 attendees were on hand to see the vehicles and learn about the changes in diesel technology.
most importantly, these technologies will be available more quickly and at less cost than others that require significant infrastructure investments.
high fuel economy gains are driving demand for diesel hybrid buses, making them the technology of choice for many of the country’s top transit districts.
as for next generation renewable diesel fuel, mccormick noted that there was already commercial production of this fuel from poultry fat in the u.s (70 million gallons/yr) and that these fuels, which are hydrocarbons meeting the same astm standard as petroleum diesel, were being developed from a variety of feedstocks and had shown exceptional fuel properties.
schaeffer noted that this, together with diesel’s low emissions, durability, efficiency and availability, meant that clean diesel would play a strong role in establishing a sustainable energy future.
mccormick explained that the rfs2 had created a market for renewable diesel fuels, many of which were at varying stages of development.
finally bob mccormick, principle engineer for fuels performance at the national renewable energy laboratory talked about doe’s non-petroleum based fuels program which includes work on the performance of b20 and hydrocarbon renewable diesel fuels in today’s vehicles.

this three-part luncheon series discussed how commercial availability of renewable diesel fuel and further fuel economy enhancements such as those currently underway in doe’s vehicle technologies program make diesel technology a smart, high-value, low-cost investment for reducing america’s dependence on petroleum.
volkswagen recently opened a new manufacturing plant in chattanooga, tn which will help the company meet anticipated strong demand for the its new clean diesel passat.
with a new ram 3500 laramie pickup truck beside him, schaeffer showed how the purchase of heavy-duty diesel pickup trucks sold from 2003-2007 would save 37 times more co2 emissions and 25 times more fuel than would be saved by the number of prius purchases during these same four years.
they learned about each vehicles’ fuel economy and emissions benefits, with many using their newfound knowledge to answer a quiz for the possibility of winning a $100 fuel card.
complementing these economic benefits are clean diesel’s extremely low emissions, including approximately 20 percent fewer greenhouse gas emissions than gasoline counterparts due to the vehicle’s greater efficiency.
mccormick explained that the rfs2 had created a market for renewable diesel fuels, many of which were at varying stages of development.
underpinning diesel’s advantages is its inherent superior energy density compared to other fuels such as gasoline, natural gas and renewable fuels.
it is also becoming more expensive, making the switch to renewable fuels one which will provide both environmental and economic benefits.

traditional “fame” biodiesel, which is classified as an advanced biofuel due to its 50 percent lower ghg emissions than petroleum fuel, had record production in may of this year and was on track to provide the mandated volume of 1 billion gallons in 2012.
he added that the growing use of hybrid technologies and renewable diesel fuels in concert with diesel engines would enable significant savings in petroleum consumption and co2 emissions.
several attendees took advantage of the rare opportunity to sit in the roomy new peterbilt class 8 tractor or the snazzy little 4x4 diesel gator.
johnson was confident that greater volumes of renewable fuels would be used in the coming years which would help reduce the demand for imported petroleum.
even many work trucks found in communities across the country are integrating hybrid technologies to reduce fuel consumption.
she also highlighted the importance of biodiesel in reducing emissions and dependence on foreign oil.

higgins outlined the findings of a hart energy study conducted for the diesel technology forum, noting that global demand for diesel fuel would grow much faster than demand for gasoline and that refiners were accounting for this growth in their expansion plans.
although today’s diesel engines still run primarily on diesel fuel, these needs are being reduced through engine and vehicle enhancements, application of hybrid technologies and greater use of renewable diesel fuels.
he concluded diesel would play a significant role in the emergence of the green energy economy because of diesel fuel’s unique attributes – its energy density, low-sulfur content, widespread availability and compatibility with biofuels.
due to this strong demand for its diesel vehicles and their superior environmental performance, vw sees clean diesel as a key factor in its strategy for meeting tighter fuel economy standards and other anticipated environmental standards.
finally bob mccormick, principle engineer for fuels performance at the national renewable energy laboratory talked about doe’s non-petroleum based fuels program which includes work on the performance of b20 and hydrocarbon renewable diesel fuels in today’s vehicles.

the three-part congressional luncheon series focusing on making u.s. transportation and goods movement more fuel efficient and environmentally-friendly was hosted by the diesel technology forum.
like johnson, he highlighted the improved quality of biodiesel fuels today, noting that testing had generally shown little or no impact on fuel economy, catalyst durability and nox emissions when used as a b20 blend.
