once we change things by what we do, it is very hard, and very expensive to reverse trends.
as an inhabitant of earth, from your viewpoint it is probably considered to be environmentally bad – the eruption injected millions of tons of fine ash into the atmosphere, cutting out the sun’s rays and making breathing difficult for many.
in fact, without volcanic eruptions and weathering, the earth as we know it today wouldn’t exist.
it has changedits environment many, many times, so when we talk about changing the environment, what we’re talking about is changing our environment.
we have been dumping our sewage into the oceans with nary a thought for the inhabitants of the sea.
doesn’t seem much when you’re talking about yourself, but figuring in the other 6.5/7.0 billion people with an average lung capacity of 5 litres or thereabouts, that’s an awful lot of co2 being emitted.
containers set out by well-meaning town councils in singapore for separation of materials are abused and filled with all sorts of rubbish by thoughtless, ignorant people.
so much for the environment.
having said all that, there is so much more that can be done, and should be done to becoming environmentally friendlier than we are at present.
glass, plastic, aluminium, paper, cardboard – can all be separated out for recycling.
water will always flow downhill, never up, trying to reach equilibrium.
so in reality you can’t claim that something is environmentally friendly unless you sum all of the polluting activities it goes through to get to the final product.
the production of petrol is a fairly refined process, but its combustion products pollute the atmosphere, so does that make it environmentally unfriendly?
we are also changing the ecology by our behaviour.

when a tree died, it fell to the ground, decayed and provided nourishment for the next cycle, but now we chop down the trees, drag them away to use them for firewood, fence posts and furniture without returning the nutrients to the soil.

the result is that they only get one, or two growing seasons out of the land before they have to chop down more trees.
the volcano also spewed out millions of cubic metres of new rock, rock rich in minerals that will assist in the growing of vegetation and such like.
if it had been really bad, it could have blocked out the sun for an extended period of time bringing on an ice age.
but you cannot compare an electric car to a petrol engine or diesel engine car simply by its emission levels into the environment.
the volcano also spewed out millions of cubic metres of new rock, rock rich in minerals that will assist in the growing of vegetation and such like.
it definitely altered your environment considerably.
glass, plastic, aluminium, paper, cardboard – can all be separated out for recycling.

and yet, they are the first to squeal when the council doesn’t collect garbage from their front door every morning!
ecology, on the other hand, is the conditions caused by organisms on their environment.

long ago, the earth was hotter, wetter and covered by dense vegetation but man began to show his domination and, to provide room for growing his food, chopped down the trees.
the recent eruption of an icelandic volcano with the almost unpronounceable name ofeyjafjallajökull made a considerable impact on our environment, both locally and globally.

the soil becomes dried and powdery with no roots to hold it together then, when it rains, gets washed down into the rivers, blocking dams, overflowing river banks – causing landslides and killing people.
the box might be sitting on the beach, in the middle of a field, on top of a mountain, or any one of a million or more places, but your environment is constrained by the bottom, four walls and the top of that box.
we have been pumping massive quantities of combustion exhaust gases and other volatile substances into the atmosphere for at least the last 300 years, since the industrial revolution.
like all live systems, the earth will do its best to achieve equilibrium, i.e., the least energy demanding state.
water will always flow downhill, never up, trying to reach equilibrium.
the hydrogen comes from basically the same refining process as the petrol, the electricity to charge the battery most likely is made by power stations that burn oil, natural gas or coal and what is environmentally friendly about any of them?
ecology, on the other hand, is the conditions caused by organisms on their environment.
these factors include the atmosphere, climate, continental landform, the hydrosphere (the water ecosystem of planet earth) and the oceans.

our tolerance is much finer than that of the earth, we are but a minute or so in its twenty-four hour lifespan.

as i said before, the earth will survive.

you have to begin at the mining for the iron ore or aluminium ore, the drilling for the oil and gas which goes to the making of the plastics that will be made into the vehicle – up until it sits in the showroom a hybrid or petrol driven vehicle has exactly the same environmental impact!
the effect on the land is even more devastating.
if you can imagine yourself enclosed within a big box - bottom, top and four sides – the inside of that box is your environment.
all earth’s systems will try their best to reach that condition.

we see advertisements daily about such and such a car – hybrids - environment friendly, because they run on electricity and/or hydrogen.

even you are not particularly environmentally friendly when you consider you are breathing in oxygen and breathing out carbon dioxide.

even flashy looking hybrids consume loads of energy to make.

unlike the environment, to which, by our behaviour we can make substantial changes, ecology is not a reversible system.

things like increasing populations, food scarcity, pollution of the environment, global warming - extinctions, both of plant and animal species - are all ecological, i.e., affecting the ecology.
