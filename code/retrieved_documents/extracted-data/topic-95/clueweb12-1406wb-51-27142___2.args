we could drastically reduce our reliance on petroleum by going the diesel hybrid route.
when chrysler showed the dodge intrepid diesel-electric hybrid a few years ago, i was impressed.
thedieselnet site has more info, but some of it is only available to paid subscribers.
companies like asda in the uk are already using chicken fat from their cooked chickens to fuel their trucks, thereby saving money and tax, and helping the environment.
even better than growing crops to produce fuel, is using a waste product that would otherwise be of little profit for the meat industry, and be an environmental problem to dispose of.
the irony is that diesel hybrids could be far more efficient and clean than anything now on the market, without any leaps in technology.
i have friends in england who have been useing used cooking oil for quit some time in thier cars.
it's the only way trains could get enough torque to start moving, but it is also exactly the model used by todays 2nd-gen hybrid autos.
european automakers are testing the water to see if american buyers, long ago turned off by earlier diesel technology, would be willing to give diesels another chance.

diesel-electric hybrid buses are available and have been rolled out in (among other places)seattle, washington and apeldoorn, in the netherlands.

most miles driven are sub-urban and urban, and an effient people mover is what is needed.
we need to begin moving as fast as we can towards sustainability now, that doesn't mean we must live less comfortably, but it does mean we need to think more about the consequences of all our decisions.
vw offers three diesel models in the us right now, all of which get about 40mpg city/45 highway: golf, new beetle and jetta.
the diesel jetta also comes in a wagon version.
as far as the drawbacks of diesel are concerned, they have been taken care of.
the manufacturers should take advantage of the wait to license the toyota hybrid system (asford did earlier this year) and integrate it with their advanced clean diesel engines.
let's get that intrepid hybrid out of the vault, update the tech, and start putting them on the street!!
they get thiers use oil from restaurant so does walmart,sams club also chines restaurant.
you take a gasoline engine with the best tuning and this is cleaner.
here was a full sized car that was getting better fuel efficiency than most small cars and was a lot more convenient to drive than other alternative fuel vehicles.
the mileage being clocked, hard miles in the boonies as well as highway, is 350,000 kilometers fairly trouble free with minimal exhaust pollution.
while biodiesel, petroleum from thermal depolymerisation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thermal_depolymerization , and enzyme hydrolysis of plant cellulosehttp://www.purevisiontechnology.com/technology/hydrolysis.html all provide alternates to traditional petroleum ,there won't be enough to replace our currently wastefull usage.
kerosene may not be readily available in the us or other locations.
it's particularly notable that the results in the mit study were based on the assumption that the diesel fuel would be petroleum-based.
thedieselnet site has more info, but some of it is only available to paid subscribers.
i think its important to mention the aspect of diesel eletric hybrid motorcycle as well.
comfortable, powerful sedans could get upwards of 80 miles per gallonand be carbon-neutral.
in 2006 this is supposed to change due to federal regulation, so at that point vw and other companies could sell these types of cars in the us.
and we could do this with directly with electric energy (the advantage being that we could generate this with [currently affordable] wind power, solar power and or tidal power).
cars turn thier drivers into virtual supermen, allowing them to run at 65+ miles per hour for hours at a time while carrying extra thousands of pounds.
biodiesel is synthesized entirely from plants -- usually soy in the us, and canola/rapeseed in europe -- and is therefore carbon-neutral: the soy/canola grown to create biodiesel pulls from the air the same amount of carbon the eventual combustion produces.
i am interested in the bio-diesel technology because the cleaner the burn the happier i am for the enviroment.
transportation (very, very expensive, very, very ineficient public transportation) in view of the cost of roads, petroleum subsidies, environmental damage, and loss of limb and life.
as a nzer, i'm excited by my government's move toward re-using our meat industry by-product - tallow - as a fuel.
the us$1.00 is valued at tts6.30 to give a comparison or us$0.24 per liter.
from what i understand it gets around 80 mpg and is about the size of a mini cooper, and costs quite a bit less.
diesels operate most effeciently when run at a constant rpm and in a given temp range, both of which fit the hybrid model very well.
yes, we'll still need construction vehicles, delivery vehicles, emergency vehicles, rural vehicles, farm vehicles and some will want recreational vehicles, but that is a small fraction of the hundreds of millions of vehicles that are on the road every year.

this is one way that hybrid technology could really show its strengths: a hybrid-svo could warm up the svo with an electric heater while running on batteries at lower speeds, much like the current prius does.

stylish sedans coupling the power of a diesel engine with extreme fuel efficiency better than anything coming out of japan -- dealers wouldn't be able to keep them in stock.
vw double-insulates the engine cage to make sure that noise is sufficiently dampened, and their are scrubbers on the exhaust to minimize the soot.
such a system could easily use regular diesel and biodiesel, as well.)
the exhaust is perfectly clean.
here, kero was cheaper than diesel but the price was raised earlier this year to make them equal at tt$1.50 per liter.
combining the power of diesel engines with the efficiency of hybrid technologies can have terrific payoffs.
i'd like to point out that it's not only vege oil that can be used in diesel cars.
companies like asda in the uk are already using chicken fat from their cooked chickens to fuel their trucks, thereby saving money and tax, and helping the environment.
in europe, where advanced-technology "clean" diesel autos are one-third to one-half of the auto market and growing, some diesel cars already get mileage roughly equivalent to hybrids, so i suspect there's simply less demand.
biodiesel is synthesized entirely from plants -- usually soy in the us, and canola/rapeseed in europe -- and is therefore carbon-neutral: the soy/canola grown to create biodiesel pulls from the air the same amount of carbon the eventual combustion produces.
the mileage being clocked, hard miles in the boonies as well as highway, is 350,000 kilometers fairly trouble free with minimal exhaust pollution.
the true cost of gas or diesel is easily greater than $5 a gallon (when federal corperate subsidies to oil companies and federal defence dollars used directly to protect us oil interests are included).
these fuels are referred to by the percentage of biodiesel in the mix, from b5 (five percent bio) all the way to b100 (straight biodiesel); b20 is a relatively common mix.
everyday there is evidence that people are not responsible enough to be those supermen.
advances in technology since then should have brought the price premium more in line with peoples wallets now so this is the time, chrysler.
biodiesel is available both straight or in mixes with regular -- and, up until recently, somewhat less expensive -- oil-based diesel.
my friend say that there trucks over there also use the cooking oil sam club, walmart etc:.
brian, clean road diesel (also known as ultra low sulfur diesel) is limited to particulate density of 30ppm, less than 10% of particulate density of standard road diesel; future efforts can bring that down to 15ppm.
the combination of modern clean diesel engines, prius-style serial hybrid-electric systems, and biodiesel/vegetable oil fuels could provide amazing mileage, cleaner air, and vastly reduced petroleum dependency.
svo, or "straight vegetable oil," can gum up the engine at lower temperatures, so there aresvo-conversion kits available for diesel vehicles which use a small amount of regular diesel or biodiesel to warm up the engine first.
i am interested in the bio-diesel technology because the cleaner the burn the happier i am for the enviroment.

the production of biodiesel in large enough quantities to sustain a transportation network would certainly involve agribusiness.
the manufacturers should take advantage of the wait to license the toyota hybrid system (asford did earlier this year) and integrate it with their advanced clean diesel engines.
and scrubbing the exhaust is unnecessary when using the high-grade diesel fuels.
in the us, the diesel fuel available in most locations remains the old, dirty, high-sulfur variety, so a hybrid diesel actually wouldn't be a significant improvement in emissions; once low-sulfur regulations take effect in 2006, this may change.

but agribiz is not the sole catalyst for biodiesel research; as i indicated in the post, the carbon-neutral nature of biodiesel, along with the simplicity of its production, make it a much more sustainable fuel resource.biodiesel.org has some info, but they do seem to be allied with big ag.
most commercial products could be delivered to within a couple miles of thier final destination by rail, just as fast and more efficiently than they are now.
the carmakers may want to wait for a couple of years; the 2006 change-over to clean diesel will make diesel vehicles much more attractive.
diesel-hybrid-electrics would be an obvious positive development.
rider a biodiesel-based, ultra-efficient hybrid-diesel automobile & transportation system would give a putative hydrogen economy a serious challenge, especially since the infrastructure changes required are far less dramatic, the necessary technology far less speculative, and the severence of ties to petroleum nations and industries far more complete.
