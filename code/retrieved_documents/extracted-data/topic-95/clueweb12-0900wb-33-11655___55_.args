the hybrid technology reduced emissions by 22 percent to 216 g/mile co2 and improved fuel economy by 28 percent to 50.2 mpg.the small family car achieves a fuel economy of an estimated 69 mpg and emits 38 percent fewer co2 emissions than its non-hybrid counterpart.with a 31 percent reduction in global warming emissions compared with the is 250, the hs 250h is in the top tier of hybrids for emissions performance the use of a more efficient gasoline engine with the hybrid system provides comparable acceleration performance to the is 250 (rather than boost acceleration, as is the case with some hybrids) and allows lexus to achieve a strong environmental performance with the hs 250h.the rx 450h fwd utilizes a more efficient atkinson combustion cycle in its gasoline engine, which, combined with a hybrid drivetrain, gives it significant global warming emissions reductions.the flywheel system combined with idle-off technology is expected to give the hybrid about a 20 percent boost in fuel economy over the conventional version.the micro turbine engines are an experimental advance on the conventional gasoline engine, and still pose an engineering and cost challenge to jaguar.hybrid’s drivetrain stores the energy saved in regenerative braking periods in a flywheel system, which is capable of spinning up to 60,000 rpm and can house enough energy to deliver around 80 horsepower for up to seven seconds.the xf hybrid’s drivetrain stores the energy saved in regenerative braking periods in a flywheel system, which is capable of spinning up to 60,000 rpm and can house enough energy to deliver around 80 horsepower for up to seven seconds.the vehicle achieves a fuel economy of an estimated 60 mpg in mixed driving and an all-electric range of 31 miles.peugeot expects the diesel hybrid to provide fuel savings of up to 35 percent over a non-hybridized engine with the same performance.the 2011 civic hybrid obtains a 29 percent reduction in global warming emissions compared with the conventional civic—a solid overall performance, though numerous other vehicles (including the new hyundai sonata hybrid) have now passed the 30 percent improvement mark.new fuel efficiency estimates represent a more-than-30 percent boost in fuel economy in the epa city and combined driving cycles, compared to the previous generation, thanks largely to the new hybrid powertrain, but also due to lighter vehicle weight and optimized aerodynamics.the s400 hybrid gains a 14 percent reduction in global warming emissions compared with the conventional s550 .unfortunately, a poorly performing tailpipe emissions-control system severely compromises the smog-forming emissions performance of the infiniti m hybrid, earning it an epa air pollution score of 6.according to mercedes, the new hybrid technology will not be used to boost performance but will be used strictly for better fuel economy and to decrease carbon dioxide emissions.
