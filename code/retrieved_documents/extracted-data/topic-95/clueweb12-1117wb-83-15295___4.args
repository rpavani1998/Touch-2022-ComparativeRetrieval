at track your truck, we are committed to helping you improve your fleet.
gasoline engines operate more quickly than diesel engines because of lighter components.
however, if your vehicle must haul heavy equipment or a trailer, even if the distance is short, a diesel truck engine could be preferable.
however, the standard for most fleets of vehicles still comes down to the choice of diesel vs. gas trucks.
by comparison, a gasoline engine uses a spark-ignition system to run solely on gasoline.
by contrast, a gasoline engine could be cheaper for fleets that make shorter trips.
another argument in favor of diesel engines says that because the engines are more efficient for longer trips, they are the environmentally friendly option for certain transportation fleets.
to commence ignition, this system relies on the heat from compression to burn fuel that is injected into the engine’s combustion chamber.
in october 2011, the national average showed a difference of about 30 cents per gallon.

by contrast, a gasoline engine could be cheaper for fleets that make shorter trips.
for gasoline engines, the fuel and air are mixed prior to combustion in the carburetor or via an electronic fuel injection system.
fleets have upgraded accordingly, and companies have stood by engines that work best for them.
it’s worth noting, however, that gasoline engines release more carbon dioxide, which has been said to contribute to global climate change.

another argument in favor of diesel engines says that because the engines are more efficient for longer trips, they are the environmentally friendly option for certain transportation fleets.
diesel engines, especially when used for long distances, are considerably more efficient, and diesel fuel could actually end up costing less.
city buses in chicago, for example, are gradually moving toward hybrid and electric alternatives.
the difference is how it mixes the fuel, air and a spark to trigger the combustion process.

while it’s true that modern diesel engines have significantly reduced the vapors they emit, the levels are still higher than with gasoline engines.

economics diesel fuel is generally more expensive than gasoline, but not by much.
as low as $199/ unit & $21.99/ month fuel and maintenance costs drive decisions when it comes to selecting the type of engine to power your fleet.
for gasoline engines, the fuel and air are mixed prior to combustion in the carburetor or via an electronic fuel injection system.
when to choose a diesel engine vehicle as a rule of thumb, if your fleet is traveling shorter distances, gasoline is your better option, as diesel engines are better suited for long-distance travel.
