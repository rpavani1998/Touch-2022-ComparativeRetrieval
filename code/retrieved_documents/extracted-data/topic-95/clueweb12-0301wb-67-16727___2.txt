the left-hand dial in the instrument panel indicates the percentage of power used or recovered during phases of braking or deceleration.
this frees up a gigantic 1501 litre compartment that is easy to load.
the large grab handle on  the centre console enables them to find the ideal position for a comfortable  journey.
the 3008 hybrid4 will be produced in france (in sochaux and mulhouse) and  marketed in the spring of 2011 in europe.
environmental efficiency
this “high voltage” stop & start system with a generous output of 8 kw can also generate the electricity needed for operation of the electric motor under all circumstances if required (four wheel drive mode).
the name hybrid4 designates the hybridization of a diesel engine (2.0 litre  hdi fap 120 kw / 163 bhp) with an electric motor offering a maximum power  output of 27 kw (37 bhp).
three different scales indicate the battery status: charge, eco (optimal operating range), power. suppliers to develop its hybrid4 technology, the psa peugeot citroën group has teamed up with suppliers offering the best know-how in each field.
since diesel engines consume less fuel than petrol  engines, they are the ideal choice for this type of hybridization.
hybrid technology uses two power trains which can operate alternately or  simultaneously: - the hdi diesel engine operates in its most optimal operating window on  longer, out-of-town journeys.
a real breakthrough in terms of improved fuel consumption and co2  emissions, dynamic performance levels, four wheel drive, electric only mode,  etc, the hybrid4 technology brings a number of benefits without any  compromises.
simplicity of use from a functional point of view, a selection knob on the centre console
the 3008 hybrid4 therefore stands out by its visual signature, but also by the fact that it is the first 3008 to receive the marque’s new badge on its bonnet.

3008 + hybrid4 (diesel + electric) =
here too, the presence of a “hobby” lower  tailgate, and the wide black and chrome protective trims on the lower section,  illustrate the “outdoor” feel of this crossover.
ptmu (power train management unit)
the choice of architecture was also guided by the search for optimal  efficiency and consistency.
high-voltage battery pack the ni-mh (nickel metal hydride) batteries are located under the boot sill, near the electric motor.
combined with the folding front passenger seat, the 3008 hybrid4 offers a  perfectly flat floor from the hobby to the fascia panel.
the 3008 hybrid4 thus offers a new and highly technological approach to motoring, combining renewed driving enjoyment with a very low level of co2 emissions.
a viable technical and economic solution the rear installation of the vehicle’s “electric  components” provides a new technical and economic solution.
the 3008 crossover has been chosen as the first application of this innovative technology.
distinctive materials are deployed throughout to accentuate the crossover feel and explore new avenues of expression.
inside the car too, the hybridization of concepts opens up unsuspected  possibilities.
in the future, and for markets where diesel is less popular, a petrol combustion engine may also serve as the base for hybrid4 type hybridization.
the driver can apply this mode to drive discreetly around town or demonstrate the silence of the vehicle in electric mode, etc, - four-wheel drive mode (4wd) instructs both power trains to operate together as far as possible; the rear wheels are then driven by the electric motor and the front wheels by the hdi diesel engine.
the ring of the steering wheel bearing the signature “hybrid4” hy for its part adds a touch of exclusivity to the car.
here, the external style successfully evokes the vehicle’s high  innovative content.
in the medium term, this battery technology remains the most appropriate in terms of cost and industrialisation for vehicles produced in large volumes.
this accentuates the imposing height of the waistline, which with its exclusive 17’’ oltis alloy wheels and black waist moulding, contributes to the sense of strength apparent in the vehicle as a whole.
secondly, this architecture is achieved by means of the use of a simple and  compact rear module containing the electric motor, its ancillary equipment and  also the rear drive train and suspension.
the end result is a crossover with a length of 4.36 m, four wheel drive, a maximum power output of 200 bhp, fuel consumption in the combined cycle of only 3.8 litres/100 km and emissions of 99 g/km!
combined with the folding front passenger seat, the 3008 hybrid4 offers a perfectly flat floor from the hobby to the fascia panel.
the 3008 hybrid4 is designed to appeal to demanding, technophile customers  in search of a rewarding and original car.
this high-voltage battery pack comes in addition to  the standard 12v battery under the bonnet, which carries on performing its  normal duties.
the ptmu is an electronic controller that automatically manages the  different operating modes of the hdi diesel engine and electric motor in a very  innovative way for the driver, helping optimise fuel consumption.
hybrid technology uses two power trains which can operate alternately or simultaneously: - the hdi diesel engine operates in its most optimal operating window on longer, out-of-town journeys.
these new sensations find expression in a number of ways: - silent operation, with the possibility of driving in electric only mode, - peace of mind offered by the safety inherent in four wheel drive, - high performance combined with high levels of driveability, - unique freedom and simplicity of use with the possibility of choosing four operating modes: zev, 4wd, sport, auto.
at the front, peugeot’s stylistic codes have been adapted to the  car’s generous dimensions to mark a break with what has gone before.
on higher specification versions, emissions can rise to 104 or 108 g/km of  co2 in the combined cycle.
to date, the 106 electric, marketed between 1995 and 2003, remains the world’s highest selling zero emissions car (in total the psa group produced nearly 10,000 vehicles, making it a genuine industrial pioneer in this field).
the driver can apply this mode to  drive discreetly around town or demonstrate the silence of the vehicle in  electric mode, etc, - four-wheel drive mode (4wd) instructs both power trains to operate  together as far as possible; the rear wheels are then driven by the electric  motor and the front wheels by the hdi diesel engine.
energy recovery an energy recovery system (when the electric motor becomes a generator)  enables kinetic energy to be transformed into electrical energy to recharge the  ni-mh batteries during deceleration (release of the accelerator and braking).
the 3008 hybrid4 therefore stands out by its visual signature,  but also by the fact that it is the first 3008 to receive the marque’s  new badge on its bonnet.
the design of the multi-arm rear suspension is the fruit of all of the  marque’s expertise in this field, bearing in mind that the same  technology is also employed on the 407, recognised for its excellent  driveability, road holding and comfort.
in the future, and for markets where diesel is less popular, a petrol  combustion engine may also serve as the base for hybrid4 type hybridization.
peugeot’s choice of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising environmental demands with driving sensations not previously available in a hybrid vehicle.
from the boot, a rear seat folding system, controlled by switches mounted on  the load area side trims, allows the seats in the second row to be folded  automatically, as if by magic.
changeover from the hdi diesel engine to the electric motor occurs automatically, thanks to astop & start system which places the hdi diesel engine in standby and restarts it as and when conditions require (accelerator pedal usage, low battery charge level, etc), - the two power sources also complement each other in certain driving conditions (“boost” effect during strong acceleration, when overtaking another vehicle, for example).
inside its roomy architecture and the driving position bears all the hallmarks of a top-of-the-range coupé, or even an aircraft cockpit.
lastly, a latest-generation satellite navigation system helps to guide users on their travels.
at the rear, the curved wings blend seamlessly with the hi-tech lights.
it provides a constant 20 kw (27 bhp), and has a peak output of 27 kw (37 bhp).
offering peace of mind, safety and driveability, four-wheel drive accentuates the vehicle’s dynamic character.
the new peugeot 3008 hybrid4 stands out due to its cutting-edge technology, allowing a seamless combination of responsible driving and driving enjoyment, but also by its specific styling.
this “high voltage” stop & start system with a  generous output of 8 kw can also generate the electricity needed for operation  of the electric motor under all circumstances if required (four wheel drive  mode).
at the end of 2010, peugeot will continue in this vein  by becoming the first manufacturer to launch a latest-generation 100% electric  vehicle in europe, the peugeot i0n.
it enhances this technological ambience in the same way as  the 7’’ colour display which provides information on the energy  flows.
four wheel drive this original layout allows the possibility of four wheel drive: the hdi diesel engine under the bonnet drives the front wheels, while the electric motor (in the rear drive train) drives the rear wheels.
man-machine interface a 7’’ 16/9 colour screen or a multi-function display, according to the car’s specification, informs the driver in real time of the operating status of the hybrid power train and the battery charge status by means of an 8 bar electronic gauge system.
this successful crossover results from the hybridization of several motoring concepts: suv, saloon, compact mpv, coupé… added to this are the benefits of hybrid4, which in the present case and for the first time combines diesel and electric power to offer the perfect response to customer expectations: “ecological” four wheel drive, controlled power, a high level of safety, assured modularity and a new driving sensation, all within an environmentally responsible approach.
combined with a raised and dominating driving position it has everything in  place to reward its drivers and offer a range of new driving sensations not  previously found in a hybrid vehicle.
these sensations are enhanced further by the general ambience of the  passenger compartment: high-tech and exclusive.
it also allows the 3008 hybrid4 to be recognised by the integration of familiar features.
on the 3008 hybrid4, these components have been made as small as possible  to optimise the installation in the vehicle.
the “hybrid” power train basically combines a diesel engine and  an electric motor.
enables the driver to choose between four different operating modes: - “auto” mode: the electronics automatically control the entire  system, including transitions between the hdi diesel engine and the electric  motor.
an expansive  fascia panel, controls within easy hand’s reach and an ergonomic centre  console clearly separate the territory of the pilot.
the 3008 hybrid4 will be produced in france (in sochaux and mulhouse) and marketed in the spring of 2011 in europe.
combined with a raised and dominating driving position it has everything in place to reward its drivers and offer a range of new driving sensations not previously found in a hybrid vehicle.
the performance of the hybrid4 is therefore directly comparable to that obtained with a single hdi diesel engine of a much higher capacity, with good levels of responsiveness backed by a real breakthrough in terms of reduced fuel consumption and co2 emissions (around 35% less in the combined cycle for equivalent performance).
in terms of performance, the 3008 hybrid4 can benefit from the combined  power of the hdi diesel engine and electric motor during acceleration, for an  immediate surge in power (“boost” function).
in this case, activation of the hdi diesel  engine is programmed to coincide with more sustained phases of acceleration.
firstly, it avoids the need for any major redesign of the engine compartment, while also allowing a better weight distribution.
driving pleasure contrary to current beliefs, the use of hybrid technology also offers improved driving freedom and introduces new benefits at several levels: - high performance combined with excellent driveability, - freedom and simplicity of use with the possibility of choosing four different operating modes: zev, 4wd, sport, auto, - silent operation, with the possibility of driving in electric only mode, - peace of mind offered by the safety inherent in four wheel drive, - environmental friendliness with emissions starting from 99 g/km of co2.
driving aids: high-tech equipment for safety and driving enjoyment comfortably seated behind the steering wheel, drivers will note among the  equipment at their disposal certain references to the world of aviation.
peugeot’s choice of the diesel hybrid demonstrates that it is possible to combine uncompromising environmental demands with driving sensations until now not available in a hybrid vehicle.
this recovery system enables the driver to use “free” energy and  reduce fuel consumption accordingly.
a diesel engine still remains the most efficient  and versatile choice to power any vehicle, - the electric motor takes over from the hdi diesel engine in phases  of lower power demands, particularly when starting up or driving at low speed  and decelerating (energy recovery).
the customer benefits are immediate with a high level specification and a reduction of 35% in fuel consumption, a real breakthrough for a car of this size and performance.
secondly, this architecture is achieved by means of the use of a simple and compact rear module containing the electric motor, its ancillary equipment and also the rear drive train and suspension.
this brings about significant gains in fuel consumption and emissions in urban conditions.
with a 3008 benefiting from hybrid4 technology, the aim is to appeal to customers who expect not only environmental-friendliness and technological sophistication, but also real driving enjoyment.
here, the external style successfully evokes the vehicle’s high innovative content.
it generates a constant torque of 100 nm, or a peak of 200 nm.
simplicity of use from a functional point of view, a selection knob on the centre console enables the driver to choose between four different operating modes: - “auto” mode: the electronics automatically control the entire system, including transitions between the hdi diesel engine and the electric motor.
they also benefit from numerous storage spaces, particularly in the rear floor and the generous centre console at the front.
by launching the world’s first full diesel hybrid vehicle, the 3008 hybrid4, peugeot will create a new type of vehicle in terms of freedom of use and driving enjoyment.
with the 3008 hybrid4 crossover, the environmentally-friendly combination  of diesel and electric power also paves the way for: - 4 wheel drive, - a maximum power of 200 bhp, - zev mode (zero  emission vehicle), - 3.8 litres/100 km, with 99 g/km of co2.
the ptmu is an electronic controller that automatically manages the different operating modes of the hdi diesel engine and electric motor in a very innovative way for the driver, helping optimise fuel consumption.
technical details of the 3008 hybrid4 at the front the 2.0 litre hdi fap 120 kw (163 bhp) diesel engine with a capacity of 1997 cm³, this euro 5 engine develops a maximum power of 120 kw at 3750 rpm and a maximum torque of 300 nm at 1580 rpm.
finally, multiple impressions emanate from the style of the car: tranquil  strength, contained power, controlled dynamism… comfort: driving and sharing interior ambience:
the electric motor and its ancillary equipment (inverter, converter, etc)  are fitted at the rear of the vehicle.
since diesel engines consume less fuel than petrol engines, they are the ideal choice for this type of hybridization.
it must also provide new driving sensations, improved driveability and improved driving enjoyment.
energy recovery an energy recovery system (when the electric motor becomes a generator) enables kinetic energy to be transformed into electrical energy to recharge the ni-mh batteries during deceleration (release of the accelerator and braking).
in the final analysis, the 3008 hybrid4 is a crossover with an exceptional technological content offering unique versatility and safety, unrivalled driving pleasure and co2 emissions of a very low level.
in terms of performance, the 3008 hybrid4 can benefit from the combined power of the hdi diesel engine and electric motor during acceleration, for an immediate surge in power (“boost” function).
these sensations are enhanced further by the general ambience of the passenger compartment: high-tech and exclusive.

these include the jukebox function, linked to the presence  of a hard disc, the gsm function, a usb connector, a dvd player, the bluetooth®system and also a graphic interface which shows city  buildings in “full 3d”.
another feature retained for the front passenger:
it is also an original and virtuous association of diesel and  electric power.
in keeping with the notion of the hybridization of genres, the car’s passenger compartment is a new source of surprise and emotion.
the hdi diesel engine is linked to an electronically-controlled manual six-speed sequential gearbox: - its electronic control enables significant savings in fuel consumption, in automatic mode, compared to a traditional automatic gearbox or even a traditional manual gearbox, - it offers real driving enjoyment gained from the possibility of choosing the gear change mode at any time - manual or automatic - with the gear lever or via controls behind the steering wheel.
for example, to ensure that drivers need never take their eyes from the road, in the manner of a fighter plane, essential driving information is projected onto a retractable transparent panel which cleverly extends from the instrument panel visor.
this accentuates the imposing height of the waistline, which with its  exclusive 17’’ oltis alloy wheels and black waist moulding,  contributes to the sense of strength apparent in the vehicle as a whole.
similarly, the electric parking brake (fse) coupled with the hill assist function, facilitates the driver’s manoeuvres and optimises space in place of the manual hand brake.
the rear module of the hybrid4  system also includes a multi-arm rear suspension system providing the guarantee  of excellent road holding.
this level of performance gives the 3008 hybrid4 record-breaking credentials in terms of the co2 emissions/ maximum power ratio.
an expansive fascia panel, controls within easy hand’s reach and an ergonomic centre console clearly separate the territory of the pilot.
inside its roomy architecture and the driving position bears all the hallmarks  of a top-of-the-range coupé, or even an aircraft cockpit.
this is true in particular of the  new and specificguérande & tramontane two-tone  leather finish which subtly combines bright pale grey on the seat cushions with  a black finish on the sides of the seats.
similarly, sanyo has provided its extensive knowledge in the field  of ni-mh high-voltage batteries .
the hybrid4 strategy capitalising on the best know-how hybrid4 technology is based on the combined use of the best technologies developed by peugeot’s engineers: diesel engine, electric motor, second-generationstop & start and an electronically-controlled sequential manual gearbox.
driving enjoyment for the next generation for peugeot, the legitimacy of this technology goes well beyond its eco-efficiency.
on higher specification versions, emissions can rise to 104 or 108 g/km of co2 in the combined cycle.
it also leaves intact the possibility of using larger capacity engines.
pursuing this common sense approach of capitalising on the best existing components and expertise, it was only natural to use the electronically-controlled 6-speed manual gearbox (mcp), not only for its engine management capabilities but also for its optimisation of fuel consumption.
virtuous association an obvious association adapting hybrid4 technology to the 3008 crossover makes obvious sense.
these new sensations find expression in a number of ways: - silent operation, with the possibility of driving in electric only mode, - peace of mind offered by the safety inherent in four wheel drive, - high performance combined with high levels of driveability, - unique  freedom and simplicity of use with the possibility of choosing four operating  modes: zev, 4wd, sport, auto.
the maximum combined  power output can then reach 147 kw (200 bhp) through the addition of 120 kw  (163 bhp) from the 2.0 litre hdi fap diesel engine and the temporary peak of  the electric motor (27 kw, or 37 bhp).
the costs of the rear module are, therefore, reduced because of the  technical possibility of deploying hybrid4 technology in different segments, on  different body shapes, etc, regardless of the type of combustion engine used.
this high-voltage battery pack comes in addition to the standard 12v battery under the bonnet, which carries on performing its normal duties.
suppliers to develop its hybrid4 technology, the psa peugeot citroën group has  teamed up with suppliers offering the best know-how in each field.
similarly, the electric parking brake (fse) coupled with the hill assist function, facilitates the driver’s manoeuvres and optimises space in  place of the manual hand brake.
the choice of architecture was also guided by the search for optimal efficiency and consistency.
here too, the presence of a “hobby” lower tailgate, and the wide black and chrome protective trims on the lower section, illustrate the “outdoor” feel of this crossover.
indeed hybrid4 technology, at low speed, allows all-terrain capabilities equivalent to those of an suv: the driver will no longer be worried by the prospect of a muddy path or a snowbound uphill drive to the ski resort; - “sport” mode favours quicker gear changes at higher engine speeds than normal mode.
a maximum torque of 500 nm is available, split 300 nm at the front from the  hdi diesel engine and a maximum of 200 nm at the rear generated by the electric  motor.
based on the manufacturer’s technical specifications, bosch has provided its expertise with respect to the electric motor, the power electronics, the reversible high-voltage alternator (stt) and other systems managing the dialogue between these components and the braking and trajectory correction systems (abs and esp).
in terms of “vehicle dynamics”, the esp of the 3008 hybrid4  incorporates an “improved traction control system” (asr) able to  exploit the car’s four wheel drive capabilities to the full on  challenging surfaces.
the inverter controls the torque of the electric motor by regulating the current from the high-voltage battery pack.
the peugeot 3008, with hybrid4 technology, is the first diesel “full hybrid” production car to be marketed in the world.
it is nonetheless constantly  evolving.
the rear module of the hybrid4 system also includes a multi-arm rear suspension system providing the guarantee of excellent road holding.
in terms of road holding, this innovative power train is well served by the chassis, recognised for its dynamic qualities.
they can enjoy the passenger compartment and its original ambience, bathed  in the light diffused by the immense panoramic glass roof.
by launching the world’s first full diesel hybrid vehicle, the 3008  hybrid4, peugeot will create a new type of vehicle in terms of freedom of use  and driving enjoyment.
the vehicle then becomes a “city run-around” par excellence thanks to the total absence of noise and emissions.
the left-hand dial in the instrument panel indicates the percentage of  power used or recovered during phases of braking or deceleration.
three  different scales indicate the battery status: charge, eco (optimal operating  range), power.
this allows optimal driving with a mix of low fuel consumption and dynamic driveability, - “zev” mode (zero emission vehicle) provides access to an extensive all-electric mode.
the large grab handle on the centre console enables them to find the ideal position for a comfortable journey.
the performance of the hybrid4 is  therefore directly comparable to that obtained with a single hdi diesel engine  of a much higher capacity, with good levels of responsiveness backed by a real  breakthrough in terms of reduced fuel consumption and co2 emissions (around 35%  less in the combined cycle for equivalent performance).
thanks to its intelligent multiflex interior and clever integration of the batteries and the special rear suspension, the 3008 hybrid4 can also be transformed to offer a considerable load capacity under the parcel shelf of 420 litres (362 dm3 vda), with 66 litres (29 dm3 vda) consisting of storage under the boot floor.
in keeping with the notion of the hybridization of genres, the car’s  passenger compartment is a new source of surprise and emotion.
a maximum torque of 500 nm is available, split 300 nm at the front from the hdi diesel engine and a maximum of 200 nm at the rear generated by the electric motor.
electric motor the synchronous permanent magnet electric motor is located cleverly at the  rear of the vehicle.
peugeot designs always bear the stamp of a strong, dynamic and recognisable personality, whatever the range concerned.
a distinctive style appeal and protective power the new peugeot 3008  hybrid4 stands out due to its cutting-edge technology, allowing a seamless  combination of responsible driving and driving enjoyment, but also by its  specific styling.
man-machine interface a 7’’ 16/9 colour screen or a multi-function display, according  to the car’s specification, informs the driver in real time of the  operating status of the hybrid power train and the battery charge status by  means of an 8 bar electronic gauge system.
driving aids: high-tech equipment for safety and driving enjoyment comfortably seated behind the steering wheel, drivers will note among the equipment at their disposal certain references to the world of aviation.
the converter converts the 200 volts from the high-voltage battery pack into 12 volts to supply the vehicle’s onboard systems.
this level of performance gives the 3008 hybrid4 record-breaking  credentials in terms of the co2 emissions/ maximum power ratio.
in the final analysis, the 3008 hybrid4 is a crossover with an exceptional  technological content offering unique versatility and safety, unrivalled  driving pleasure and co2 emissions of a very low level.
naturally this is combined with the latest generation  “octosquare” eolys additive-enhanced particulate emission filter  (fap) system.
a viable technical and economic solution the rear installation of the vehicle’s “electric components” provides a new technical and economic solution.
a distinctive style appeal and protective power
new developments may be more or less marked according to the generation and above all the category of the vehicle.

at the end of 2010, peugeot will continue in this vein by becoming the first manufacturer to launch a latest-generation 100% electric vehicle in europe, the peugeot i0n.
to  obtain this level of performance it uses the latest generation eccs ( extreme conventional combustion system) combustion chamber design, a  variable-geometry low-inertia turbocharger, a high-pressure injection pump  allowing a maximum pressure of 2000 bar in the common rail and solenoid  injectors with eight apertures.
furthermore, the driveability, safety and eco-efficiency of the system are based on simple, reasonable and consistent technological choices.
in this mode, the notion of “controlled  power” comes into its own: coupling of the diesel engine with the  electric motor provides more dynamic performance, optimally distributed and  transmitted to the road by the four wheel drive for a level of stability and  driveability that will appeal to all motoring enthusiasts.
these include the jukebox function, linked to the presence of a hard disc, the gsm function, a usb connector, a dvd player, the bluetooth®system and also a graphic interface which shows city buildings in “full 3d”.
the peugeot 3008, with hybrid4 technology, is the first diesel “full  hybrid” production car to be marketed in the world.

this results in a number of advantages not only in terms of customer benefits but also from the standpoint of the project’s economic and industrial model.
the design of the multi-arm rear suspension is the fruit of all of the marque’s expertise in this field, bearing in mind that the same technology is also employed on the 407, recognised for its excellent driveability, road holding and comfort.
the hybrid rear section of the 3008 hybrid4 will be produced in sochaux and in mulhouse.
for example, to ensure that drivers need never take their eyes from the  road, in the manner of a fighter plane, essential driving information is  projected onto a retractable transparent panel which cleverly extends from the  instrument panel visor.
since everything is controlled electronically (“by wire ”) with no mechanical link between the front and the rear, this system  has many advantages over a “traditional” integral mechanical  transmission system (with a prop shafts): - no architectural constraints affecting layout and style within the  passenger compartment (interior capacity preserved); - 4x4 and  environmental-friendliness are no longer contradicting terms.
it also leaves  intact the possibility of using larger capacity engines.
a real breakthrough in terms of improved fuel consumption and co2 emissions, dynamic performance levels, four wheel drive, electric only mode, etc, the hybrid4 technology brings a number of benefits without any compromises.
driving pleasure contrary to current beliefs, the use of hybrid technology also offers  improved driving freedom and introduces new benefits at several levels: - high performance combined with excellent driveability, - freedom and simplicity of use with the possibility of choosing four  different operating modes: zev, 4wd, sport, auto, - silent operation, with the possibility of driving in electric only  mode, - peace of mind offered by the safety inherent in four wheel drive, - environmental friendliness with emissions starting from 99 g/km of  co2.
the costs of the rear module are, therefore, reduced because of the technical possibility of deploying hybrid4 technology in different segments, on different body shapes, etc, regardless of the type of combustion engine used.
a diesel engine still remains the most efficient and versatile choice to power any vehicle, - the electric motor takes over from the hdi diesel engine in phases of lower power demands, particularly when starting up or driving at low speed and decelerating (energy recovery).
its benefits reside in its ability to fuse together different genres: - through its external architecture, with a body which carries the genes of the suv, mpv and saloon, - through its specific stylistic codes in relation to the 3008 range overall, combining power and protection, strength and elegance, leisure and status, - through its surprising and technological interior, combining the ambience of an exclusive hi-tech coupé with practical and efficient modularity, - through its dynamic specification since thanks to peugeot’s expertise and the technologies employed, this “tall single compartment” vehicle offers a level of driveability that is the envy of many a saloon.
the hybrid4 strategy capitalising on the best know-how hybrid4 technology is based on the combined use of the best technologies  developed by peugeot’s engineers: diesel engine, electric motor,  second-generationstop & start and an electronically-controlled  sequential manual gearbox.
this ingenious compartment also allows storage of the load space cover.
inside the car too, the hybridization of concepts opens up unsuspected possibilities.
for the electric component, peugeot has a historical expertise in the field of electric vehicles.
in the same perspective, a second-generationstop & start system is used.
this is true in particular of the new and specificguérande & tramontane two-tone leather finish which subtly combines bright pale grey on the seat cushions with a black finish on the sides of the seats.
new developments may be more or less marked according to the  generation and above all the category of the vehicle.
thanks to its intelligent multiflex interior and clever  integration of the batteries and the special rear suspension, the 3008 hybrid4  can also be transformed to offer a considerable load capacity under the parcel  shelf of 420 litres (362 dm3 vda), with 66 litres (29 dm3 vda) consisting of  storage under the boot floor.
distinctive materials are deployed throughout to accentuate the crossover  feel and explore new avenues of expression.
on the 3008 hybrid4, these components have been made as small as possible to optimise the installation in the vehicle.
indeed, as well as the social benefit of a steep reduction in fuel  consumption, the level of performance provided by this technology will delight  even the most demanding customers in terms of road holding, responsiveness,  driveability and peace of mind, regardless of road conditions, with the  possibility of enjoying silent operation in town in all-electric mode.
latest-generation stop & start system this system places the hdi diesel engine in standby when the vehicle is at a standstill (at traffic lights, a stop sign or in a traffic jam, etc) and when the vehicle is being driven in electric mode.
the  inverter controls the torque of the electric motor by regulating the current  from the high-voltage battery pack.
they also benefit  from numerous storage spaces, particularly in the rear floor and the generous  centre console at the front.
offering peace of mind,  safety and driveability, four-wheel drive accentuates the vehicle’s  dynamic character.
the hdi diesel engine is linked to an electronically-controlled manual  six-speed sequential gearbox: - its electronic control enables significant savings in fuel consumption,  in automatic mode, compared to a traditional automatic gearbox or even a  traditional manual gearbox, - it offers real driving enjoyment gained from  the possibility of choosing the gear change mode at any time - manual or  automatic - with the gear lever or via controls behind the steering wheel.
it also enables the hdi diesel engine to be restarted  instantly, “transparently” for the driver, when necessary.
to obtain this level of performance it uses the latest generation eccs ( extreme conventional combustion system) combustion chamber design, a variable-geometry low-inertia turbocharger, a high-pressure injection pump allowing a maximum pressure of 2000 bar in the common rail and solenoid injectors with eight apertures.
an inverter and a converter are used to control the electric power.
lastly, a latest-generation satellite navigation system helps to guide  users on their travels.
the originality of this design helps visually to seat the rear of the  vehicle.
in the medium term, this battery technology remains the most appropriate in  terms of cost and industrialisation for vehicles produced in large volumes.
the choice of a parallel architecture
in  the same perspective, a second-generationstop & start system is  used.
in terms of road holding, this innovative power train is well served by the  chassis, recognised for its dynamic qualities.
finally, multiple impressions emanate from the style of the car: tranquil strength, contained power, controlled dynamism… comfort: driving and sharing interior ambience:
changeover from the hdi diesel engine to the  electric motor occurs automatically, thanks to astop & start system which places the hdi diesel engine in standby and restarts it as and  when conditions require (accelerator pedal usage, low battery charge level,  etc), - the two power sources also complement each other in certain driving  conditions (“boost” effect during strong acceleration, when  overtaking another vehicle, for example).
the 3008 crossover has been chosen as the first application of this  innovative technology.
high-voltage battery pack the ni-mh (nickel metal hydride) batteries are located under the boot sill,  near the electric motor.
peugeot connect services offered with wipcom 3d will also  be accessible.
in this case, activation of the hdi diesel engine is programmed to coincide with more sustained phases of acceleration.
this results in smooth gear changes for optimum comfort.
it provides a constant 20 kw (27 bhp), and has a peak output of 27 kw (37  bhp).
at the front, peugeot’s stylistic codes have been adapted to the car’s generous dimensions to mark a break with what has gone before.
the “hybrid” power train basically combines a diesel engine and an electric motor.
since everything is controlled electronically (“by wire ”) with no mechanical link between the front and the rear, this system has many advantages over a “traditional” integral mechanical transmission system (with a prop shafts): - no architectural constraints affecting layout and style within the passenger compartment (interior capacity preserved); - 4x4 and environmental-friendliness are no longer contradicting terms.
the large front grille helps to define the vehicle’s status and off-road character, with its two distinctive chrome bars it is reminiscent of those found in the world of the suv.
this  results in smooth gear changes for optimum comfort.
in this mode, the notion of “controlled power” comes into its own: coupling of the diesel engine with the electric motor provides more dynamic performance, optimally distributed and transmitted to the road by the four wheel drive for a level of stability and driveability that will appeal to all motoring enthusiasts.
the  headlamps display a renewed expressiveness, with the integration of a bar of  leds providing a daytime lighting function and accentuating the car’s  visual appeal.
the electric motor and its ancillary equipment (inverter, converter, etc) are fitted at the rear of the vehicle.
it enhances this technological ambience in the same way as the 7’’ colour display which provides information on the energy flows.
it also enables the hdi diesel engine to be restarted instantly, “transparently” for the driver, when necessary.
peugeot 3008 hybrid4: the world's first diesel hybrid crossover combining  environmental protection and driving enjoyment peugeot 3008  hybrid4 the world's first diesel hybrid crossover combining environmental  protection and driving enjoyment
peugeot connect services offered with wipcom 3d will also be accessible.
the world's first diesel hybrid crossover combining environmental protection and driving enjoyment
this operates in a voltage range of between 150 and 270 volts.
in terms of “vehicle dynamics”, the esp of the 3008 hybrid4 incorporates an “improved traction control system” (asr) able to exploit the car’s four wheel drive capabilities to the full on challenging surfaces.
this results in a number of advantages  not only in terms of customer benefits but also from the standpoint of the  project’s economic and industrial model.
these are precisely the features that  characterise urban driving.
this requires the high-voltage batteries to be sufficiently charged.
the rear spoiler, two-tone with a high gloss black section, helps to differentiate the 3008 hybrid4 from other models in the range, as do the chrome badges which decorate the sides and rear of the car.
the hobby type lower tailgate opens to reveal a boot with a flat floor equipped with longitudinal securing rings that inspire quality and strength.
wipcom 3d includes all the benefits of the marque’s existing  satellite navigation systems.
with their exceptional efficiency, hdi fap diesel engines - thermodynamically more efficient than a petrol engine and offering like-for-like fuel consumption of 30% less - are clearly the best internal combustion engine choice.
operation of the bmp6 is even more enjoyable with hybrid4 technology insofar as the rear electric motor becomes active during gear changes.
the headlamps display a renewed expressiveness, with the integration of a bar of leds providing a daytime lighting function and accentuating the car’s visual appeal.
the lower front panel further reinforces  these off road aspirations, thanks in particular to the black quarter bumpers  aligned with the headlamps.
this brings about significant gains in fuel consumption and emissions  in urban conditions.
indeed, as well as the social benefit of a steep reduction in fuel consumption, the level of performance provided by this technology will delight even the most demanding customers in terms of road holding, responsiveness, driveability and peace of mind, regardless of road conditions, with the possibility of enjoying silent operation in town in all-electric mode.
at the rear rear suspension to ensure a dynamic performance on a par with the marque’s road  holding standards over a very varied range of vehicles (mid-range mpvs, top of  the range body shapes, etc), the rear electric module, transferable across  several different platforms, comprises a multi-arm rear suspension within which  are housed the electric motor and the reduction gearbox.
the 3008 hybrid4 thus offers a new and highly technological approach to  motoring, combining renewed driving enjoyment with a very low level of co2  emissions.
indeed hybrid4 technology, at low speed, allows all-terrain  capabilities equivalent to those of an suv: the driver will no longer be  worried by the prospect of a muddy path or a snowbound uphill drive to the ski  resort; - “sport” mode favours quicker gear changes at higher engine  speeds than normal mode.
this recovery system enables the driver to use “free” energy and reduce fuel consumption accordingly.
an original hybrid power train
this allows optimal driving with a mix of low fuel consumption and  dynamic driveability, - “zev” mode (zero emission vehicle) provides access  to an extensive all-electric mode.
this car is the  culmination of a project which required every ounce of expertise on the part of  peugeot’s engineers, to obtain a result on a par with the marque’s  environmental demands while at the same time providing high levels of driving  enjoyment.
from the side, the window surrounds are edged with chrome in the upper  section.
based on the manufacturer’s technical specifications, bosch has provided its expertise with respect to the electric motor, the power  electronics, the reversible high-voltage alternator (stt) and other systems  managing the dialogue between these components and the braking and trajectory  correction systems (abs and esp).
the 3008 hybrid4 is designed to appeal to demanding, technophile customers in search of a rewarding and original car.
the large front grille helps to define the vehicle’s status and  off-road character, with its two distinctive chrome bars it is reminiscent of  those found in the world of the suv.
four wheel drive this original layout allows the possibility of four wheel drive: the hdi  diesel engine under the bonnet drives the front wheels, while the electric  motor (in the rear drive train) drives the rear wheels.
the name hybrid4 designates the hybridization of a diesel engine (2.0 litre hdi fap 120 kw / 163 bhp) with an electric motor offering a maximum power output of 27 kw (37 bhp).
the maximum combined power output can then reach 147 kw (200 bhp) through the addition of 120 kw (163 bhp) from the 2.0 litre hdi fap diesel engine and the temporary peak of the electric motor (27 kw, or 37 bhp).
similarly, sanyo has provided its extensive knowledge in the field of ni-mh high-voltage batteries .
it is also an original and virtuous association of diesel and electric power.
with a 3008 benefiting from hybrid4 technology, the aim is to appeal to  customers who expect not only environmental-friendliness and technological  sophistication, but also real driving enjoyment.
versatility preserved
from the boot, a rear seat folding system, controlled by switches mounted on the load area side trims, allows the seats in the second row to be folded automatically, as if by magic.
