even to the point of, for example, waste management authorities being encouraged to invest in more advanced technical solutions, rather than - as currently - be pressured to accept the lowest price for new vehicles, or when awarding an operational contract?
the danish government believes such targeted investment is vital if energy consumption is to be reduced and our economy is to grow in a future of increasing energy costs," he adds.
the example set by denmark explodes that myth - environmental technologies look set to create over 10,000 new jobs in the next five years.
seoul recovers energy from 730,000 tonnes of waste (mar 20, 2012) 1000 tonnes of solar panels collected for recycling in 3 months (mar 19, 2012) anti 'bottle bill' pressure group grows in massachusetts (mar 19, 2012)
and if you think denmark has a pretty positive record on recycling ratios and minimising landfill - as it has - then that's as nothing compared to the impressive record the county has on energy conservation.
most observers would accept that the constant rise and fall of engine revs, as hydraulic binlifters are used, is what makes night time waste collection operations in residential areas unacceptable.
but because we don't tend to think of denmark as a major industrial producer of manufactured goods, it's interesting to note that the danish government uses its remit to help encourage new, achievable ways of creating new technologies to help boost an already impressive record on creating what we might term an environmental industry sector.
in fact, my hair is wilder than his.
'green energy' exports totalled over 50 billion danish krona ($8.5 billion) in 2011.
thanks to previous long-term government policies and investment, denmark uses no more energy today than it did in 1980, while also achieving an impressive reduction in co2 emissions well above the european average.
there is some nervousness amongst some rcv manufacturers because as we discovered in the previous issue of waste management world, if more operators purchased large numbers of quieter diesel electric hybrid rcvs and double shifted them with two crews during each 24 hour period, which helps recoup the added purchase cost for obvious reasons, this might result in fewer number of vehicles being needed in total.
research shows battery pack life of more than 2500 cycles using lifepo4 battery technology.
so passionate in fact, he gave up a top job with danfoss a/s in order to found banke accessory drives.
in contrast, a 'plug-in' battery powered auxiliary drive enables the truck's engine to be switched off while loading and packing, or stay at a constant tick-over.

it also has the support of manfred zoeller, ceo of leading german manufacturer zoeller waste systems and meldgaard, one of denmark's leading commercial waste contractors.
another interesting thing about the lean energy cluster approach is that it lends itself to new partners being added, together with local assembly within the growing economies - thus creating new jobs and saving energy in waste collection and recycling on a global basis.
it's adaptable without a major increase in tooling costs - so will benefit from an economy of scale.

"we were very interested in the model adopted by the commune in the city of solna in sweden (as reported in waste management world november/december 2011).
firstly, after a background in energy systems, he is convinced that the electrical power take-off (pto) is more efficient than the traditional hydraulic pto.

forget one company needing to 'be in charge', or owning all the other players, a cluster is lots of smaller specialists coming together on a specific project and co-operating together as equals.
in fact, designing and building high tech environmental solutions is now very much the 'industry' denmark would like to be known for internationally.
it will hopefully mean that the concept of more efficient, environmentally friendly refuse collection vehicles is no longer a dream, unique to one brand, or another.
located by just eight bolts, the same basic 'module' can be designed to fit any chassis/body combination adding environmental 'house points' to the contract bidder prepared to invest in more expensive, environmentally friendly vehicles (as opposed to just the cheapest) is supported by the danish government and regional governments such as region syddanmark - another active supporter of the lean energy cluster.
"but when it comes to more specific policies like reducing energy consumption by the country as a whole, and by organisations and individuals in particular, the danish government strongly believes all government departments, regional and local city councils and communes, should be leading by example," the minister confirmed to waste management world.
the banke system uses a 400 volt pm (permanent magnet) motor with variable rpm control - which is 60% lighter than some competitive designs.
the long-sighted policies of denmark should serve as an example to us all - and shame those larger national governments that claim the imposition of strict new environmental policies will damage growth and cause increased unemployment.
the lean energy cluster has direct support from the danish government, the local regional councils and the leading technical university of southern denmark.

so far, so environmentally friendly.
a well-attended meeting was held inside the parliament building by the lean energy cluster to outline the advantages of companies working together (in a 'cluster') on a specific project i've been invited to a special meeting in the danish parliament.
the batteries are designed to be chargeable (by a simple domestic plug) within four hours - useful when using cheaper off-peak power and essential if a double shift pattern is to be used in future.

the zoeller-produced compactor body/hopper and binlifters can be operated without need to run the engine - demonstrating how noise and fuel can be saved even to the point of, for example, waste management authorities being encouraged to invest in more advanced technical solutions, rather than - as currently - be pressured to accept the lowest price for new vehicles, or when awarding an operational contract?

the hybrid rcv will enter service with danish waste management operator meldgaard, to provide comparisons with existing diesel-fuelled hydraulically activated rcvs putting a value against the environmental gains in a waste collection contract as a way of encouraging higher standards appeals to us," he adds.
this 'pod' fits between truck can and compaction body of most waste collection vehicles with minimal loss of body length and an increase in unladen weight of just 950 kg.
if you come from a time when the only trends in industry seemed to involve large, multinational organisations and venture capitalists mopping-up smaller innovative companies, then this story will come - excuse the environmental pun - as a breath of fresh air.
the system has enough power to lift up to 1200 containers per battery pack charge - all within a modular package just 456 mm long, 2500 mm wide and 2000 mm high.
