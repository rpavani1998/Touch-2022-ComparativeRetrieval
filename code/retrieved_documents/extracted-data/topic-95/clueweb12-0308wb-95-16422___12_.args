when you factor in the cost of batteries and the negative impact caused by the heavy metals in the batteries, diesel can often be a superior investment to environment conscience buyers.diesels, on the other hand, like cruising at constant velocities, where their highly efficient combustion process allows them to extract the maximum energy out of every gallon of fuel.hybrids are better choices for folks that do mostly in-town driving but diesels excel on the highway.sure diesels aren’t new by any means, but the cost effectiveness, infrastructure and public image just aren’t where they need to be to make them viable atm.hybrid drivetrains are just as much if not more expensive than diesels, (and much more complex) even accounting for the expensive exhaust treatment required to satisfy the epa’s ridiculous regulations.you see, hybrids liketoyota’s prius or ford’s fusion do the best work in stop-start city driving, where their gas engines shut down at traffic lights, and their electric motors ease them up to speed again.with a good tuning box and sawn-off catalytic converter it can hit 250 bhp and 425 foot pound of torque.but europe’s ancient cities are perpetually jammed with diesels idling at traffic lights, while here in america you regularly see hybrids being hustled along freeways at 70-80 mph, their electric motors virtually useless.this is a land where the capability and functionality of a full-size pickup or suv makes a lot of sense.while a bmw isn’t exactly cheap and doesn’t make sense as a cost-saving fuel efficient vehicle… a jetta or golf diesel is brilliant.i don’t think gm, ford, fiat, or toyota could sustain truck sales at current levels if they had to add $3-7000 (about 15-33% of msrp) to the base half-ton truck to replace the base engine with a 2010 emissions-compliant diesel.diesel fuel is very comparable to premium unleaded (which would go into a regular 335) so you would still get the benefit of the superior mpg even with diesel fuel increases.i liked the point the author made about diesel vehicles being a good alternative to hybrids on the highway.i think a diesal hybrid would be expensive to build, but that would be the most efficient hybrid.this might be acompact car, but it’s capable of crossing a continent in giant leaps — based on our experience the 335d will easily go 515 miles between fuel stops.
