it's adaptable without a major increase in tooling costs - so will benefit from an economy of scale.thanks to previous long-term government policies and investment, denmark uses no more energy today than it did in 1980, while also achieving an impressive reduction in co2 emissions well above the european average.another interesting thing about the lean energy cluster approach is that it lends itself to new partners being added, together with local assembly within the growing economies - thus creating new jobs and saving energy in waste collection and recycling on a global basis.the long-sighted policies of denmark should serve as an example to us all - and shame those larger national governments that claim the imposition of strict new environmental policies will damage growth and cause increased unemployment.it will hopefully mean that the concept of more efficient, environmentally friendly refuse collection vehicles is no longer a dream, unique to one brand, or another.the system has enough power to lift up to 1200 containers per battery pack charge - all within a modular package just 456 mm long, 2500 mm wide and 2000 mm high.but because we don't tend to think of denmark as a major industrial producer of manufactured goods, it's interesting to note that the danish government uses its remit to help encourage new, achievable ways of creating new technologies to help boost an already impressive record on creating what we might term an environmental industry sector.most observers would accept that the constant rise and fall of engine revs, as hydraulic binlifters are used, is what makes night time waste collection operations in residential areas unacceptable.the zoeller-produced compactor body/hopper and binlifters can be operated without need to run the engine - demonstrating how noise and fuel can be saved even to the point of, for example, waste management authorities being encouraged to invest in more advanced technical solutions, rather than - as currently - be pressured to accept the lowest price for new vehicles, or when awarding an operational contract?we'll soon find out if he's right - with a fleet of over 150 'conventional' diesel/hydraulic pto-powered refuse collection and recycling trucks, meldgaard is keen to convert to hybrids as soon as possible.fuel consumption is less because the truck power unit is only required to propel the vehicle along and not to generate hydraulic power while stationary.there is some nervousness amongst some rcv manufacturers because as we discovered in the previous issue of waste management world, if more operators purchased large numbers of quieter diesel electric hybrid rcvs and double shifted them with two crews during each 24 hour period, which helps recoup the added purchase cost for obvious reasons, this might result in fewer number of vehicles being needed in total.in fact, designing and building high tech environmental solutions is now very much the 'industry' denmark would like to be known for internationally.the danish government believes such targeted investment is vital if energy consumption is to be reduced and our economy is to grow in a future of increasing energy costs," he adds.the banke system uses a 400 volt pm (permanent magnet) motor with variable rpm control - which is 60% lighter than some competitive designs.
