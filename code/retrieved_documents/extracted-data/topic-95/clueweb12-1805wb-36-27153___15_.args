combining these technologies we are able to greatly reduce our fuel consumption and overall emissions.as a showcase of alternative energy, we are able to educate 1.4 million annual visitors about the capabilities of solar, wind and other hybrid technologies.the repurposed vehicles are 44 percent more fuel efficient than standard fedex delivery trucks and produce 96 percent fewer particulates and 75 percent fewer smog-causing emissions.the hornblower hybrid, now complete and in full time service to alcatraz and angel island, not only reduces emissions during operation but also saved energy during vessel construction.the hornblower hybrid i s a technological advancement many years in the making, harnessing energy from the sun and the wind, combined with diesel engines, to propel the vessel.this environmentally progressive vessel showcases the potential power of alternative energy sources when they are combined with creative engineering solutions.that is equivalent to taking more than 60 u.s. homes off the grid for one year, significantly reducing our environmental impact.that is equivalent to taking more than 60 u.s. homes off the grid for one year, significantly reducing our environmental impact.appropriately, the hornblower hybrid is designed to inspire environmental awareness as well and to teach our guests about the importance of environmental stewardship.the hybrid boat is equipped with a customized drive system that allows the captain to monitor the energy needs of the boat and select the most efficient power sources.for those of you who do not own a toyota prius, a hybrid vessel typically uses two or more distinct power sources and a combination of a diesel engine (in our case, tier 2 marine diesel engines) with one or more electric motors.signs are also posted throughout the vessel with information on the "green" components of the boat, including countertops made of recycled glass to show passengers firsthand how materials can be reused to reduce our impact on the planet.instead of idling at the dock or burning diesel to keep the lights on, the hybrid will switch between diesel mode and battery mode in order to save fuel and reduce emissions.instead of idling at the dock or burning diesel to keep the lights on, the hybrid will switch between diesel mode and battery mode in order to save fuel and reduce emissions.our company was just the first to hire an engineering team to design and integrate the systems, making it the first successful implementation of a hybrid passenger ferry in the united states.
