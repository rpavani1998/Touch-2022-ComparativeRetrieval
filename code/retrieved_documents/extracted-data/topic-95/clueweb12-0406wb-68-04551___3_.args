while the strength of diesel lies in long-distance journeys, hybrid engines are more efficient in cities, on short trips with a high rate of stop-and-go.toyota’s future plans include offering the hybrid option for all of its vehicles, and will therefore build up its production capacity and strengthen its development activities.the example of hybrid engines shows that integrating customer-oriented technology management into a company’s overall strategy is decisive.contrary to the japanese hybrid pioneers, european vehicle manufacturers have continued to depend on diesel technology and, in addition, have focused their research on fuel cell and hydrogen technologies.as a result, consumers have become more confused and have not been encouraged to embrace environmentally friendly technologies.the air pollution debate in europe and the success of hybrid cars in the u.s. and japan could put the hybrid engine on the fast track to success in europe, as well.market research suggests that sales more than doubled last year, as 205,749 hybrids were sold.if manufacturers continue their efforts to differentiate themselves with high technology without considering the value for their customers, they will not be successful.for years, companies argued that two engines, the internal combustion engine and electric motor(s) of a hybrid, would be too expensive and too heavy.nissan is aiming for an annual output of 50,000 hybrid units of its altima model, using toyota electrical components.on strategy: hybrids & customers on strategy: hybrids & customers  with oil prices at a record high, global warming and depleting fossil fuel stocks, calls for efficient, environmentally friendly cars are becoming more frequent.hybrid vehicles will continue to move into the fast lane, especially in the u.s. and japan.the company has continuously developed hybrid technology and is therefore years ahead of the competition.companies who want to maintain or improve their market position will have to ensure that their technology management can deal with the challenges of the future.toyota’s plans have made european manu-facturers nervous, as it could soon erode their market positions, such as the idea that “exciting and innovative cars come from europe.”
