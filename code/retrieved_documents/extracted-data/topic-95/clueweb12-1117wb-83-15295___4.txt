diesel engines were among the first developed and were originally designed to replace steam engines.
at track your truck, we are committed to helping you improve your fleet.
governments worldwide are inclined to  reward businesses that opt for newer technology, such as hybrid engines and  electric vehicles.
gasoline engines operate more quickly than diesel engines because of lighter components.
naturally, the vapors released by diesel engines have been the cause of much of the debate.
however, if your vehicle must haul heavy equipment or a trailer, even if the distance is short, a diesel truck engine could be preferable.
however, the standard for most fleets of vehicles still comes down to the choice of diesel vs. gas trucks.
by comparison, a gasoline engine uses a spark-ignition system to run solely  on gasoline.
the difference is all but wiped out when you consider the efficiency of the fuel you are using.

however, the debate between diesel and gasoline engines as  the more environmentally friendly option is unsettled.
today, businesses that operate fleets are beginning to experiment with new types of engines considered to be more fuel-efficient.
by contrast, a gasoline engine could be cheaper for fleets that make shorter trips.
another argument in favor of diesel engines says that because the engines  are more efficient for longer trips, they are the environmentally friendly  option for certain transportation fleets.
to commence ignition, this system relies on the heat from compression to burn  fuel that is injected into the engine’s combustion chamber.
in  october 2011, the national average showed a difference of about 30 cents per  gallon.
when making your decision, consider the purpose of your fleet and weigh the  pros and cons of each.

for gasoline engines, the fuel and air are  mixed prior to combustion in the carburetor or via an electronic fuel injection  system.
fleets have upgraded accordingly, and  companies have stood by engines that work best for them.
below, we have explained some of the key differences between diesel and gasoline engines.
it’s worth noting, however, that gasoline engines  release more carbon dioxide, which has been said to contribute to global  climate change.

another argument in favor of diesel engines says that because the engines are more efficient for longer trips, they are the environmentally friendly option for certain transportation fleets.
diesel engines, especially when used for long  distances, are considerably more efficient, and diesel fuel could actually end  up costing less.
below, we have explained some of the key differences between diesel and  gasoline engines.
since the time of steam power, engines have  evolved to serve different purposes.
city buses in chicago, for example, are gradually moving toward hybrid and electric alternatives.
the difference is how it mixes the fuel, air and a spark to trigger the combustion process.
