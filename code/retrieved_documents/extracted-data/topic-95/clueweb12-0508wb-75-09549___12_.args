the production of petrol is a fairly refined process, but its combustion products pollute the atmosphere, so does that make it environmentally unfriendly?things like increasing populations, food scarcity, pollution of the environment, global warming - extinctions, both of plant and animal species - are all ecological, i.e., affecting the ecology.the hydrogen comes from basically the same refining process as the petrol, the electricity to charge the battery most likely is made by power stations that burn oil, natural gas or coal and what is environmentally friendly about any of them?when a tree died, it fell to the ground, decayed and provided nourishment for the next cycle, but now we chop down the trees, drag them away to use them for firewood, fence posts and furniture without returning the nutrients to the soil.we have been pumping massive quantities of combustion exhaust gases and other volatile substances into the atmosphere for at least the last 300 years, since the industrial revolution.you can only compare one similar product to another and classify one of them through your findings as being environmentally friendlier than the other.the soil becomes dried and powdery with no roots to hold it together then, when it rains, gets washed down into the rivers, blocking dams, overflowing river banks – causing landslides and killing people.as an inhabitant of earth, from your viewpoint it is probably considered to be environmentally bad – the eruption injected millions of tons of fine ash into the atmosphere, cutting out the sun’s rays and making breathing difficult for many.but you cannot compare an electric car to a petrol engine or diesel engine car simply by its emission levels into the environment.we see advertisements daily about such and such a car – hybrids - environment friendly, because they run on electricity and/or hydrogen.having said all that, there is so much more that can be done, and should be done to becoming environmentally friendlier than we are at present.so in reality you can’t claim that something is environmentally friendly unless you sum all of the polluting activities it goes through to get to the final product.these factors include the atmosphere, climate, continental landform, the hydrosphere (the water ecosystem of planet earth) and the oceans.it has changedits environment many, many times, so when we talk about changing the environment, what we’re talking about is changing our environment.doesn’t seem much when you’re talking about yourself, but figuring in the other 6.5/7.0 billion people with an average lung capacity of 5 litres or thereabouts, that’s an awful lot of co2 being emitted.
