gas burns more cleanly than coal (which is used to produce the vast majority of residential electricity in the united states).generally speaking, it’s more energy-friendly to use a gas stove than an electric stove or ac-powered (plug-in) kettle.the cold-brew method eliminates the energy needed to heat your water and takes advantage of an appliance (your refrigerator) that is already running in your home.this reduces the amount of packaging material necessary to transport the water, and typically saves you some cash, too.a cup of tea, made by boiling only the amount of water you need, produces about one tenth of the carbon footprint generated by a large cup of cappuccino.this takes advantage of the residual heat left in the burner, and reduces the energy necessary to heat your water.these are much more energy-efficient than the microwave and often boil your water in half the time.by taking care to boil only as much water as you need, you’re not wasting any water, and you’re not expending any more energy than necessary to bring it to the right temperature.natural gas is definitely not a perfect solution for all of our energy needs, but until technology and renewable energy markets develop further, it’s still better than coal.also, if you plan on resteeping your tea with leftover water boiled for the first infusion, turn the power to the stove off in between infusions, but leave the kettle on top of the stove to absorb the leftover heat.opt to use tap water first if you have safe drinking water that is relatively free of strong smells and tastes.tea is a relatively energy-efficient beverage.if you drink your tea with a meal, use the same burner you cooked with to heat your kettle while the burner is still hot.the shorter the distance your spring water has to travel to reach you, the less carbon is emitted into the atmosphere.to put this into perspective, if you drink four cups of black tea every day for a year, you will have used as much energy as a single 40-mile car ride.
