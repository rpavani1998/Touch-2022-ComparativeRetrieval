the microwave has only been missed when i want to make a "baked" potato at the last minute!
it's working for us, and it should hold up for 10 years at least.
hi andrea, yes, i'm looking forward to not having to stop the kids peering inside while it's operating!
i've looked at a couple of good quality ones now and they both have lifetime warranties on them - nothing to break!
not much lasts 20 years anymore.
i'm not missing it at all.
oh, and for some reason i keep buying microwave popcorn, even though we really like it made on the stove top.
yes, part of the reason i want to get a stovetop kettle is so that i can have something to use on our outdoor oven (if we ever get around to building it!)
- so you can heat foods up in it, boil water etc.
there's no line loss of electricity between your home and the point of generation when using gas, though gas certainly has its issues as well.
i've never heard of one so it's not making any sense at the moment - is it like a double boiler?
planned obsolence drives me insane!
i saw some very heavy stove top kettles online at kitchenware direct.
i'd been keeping my eye out for a good one over the year, but never found one.
i gave mine away years ago and have never regretted it.
when we came back to australaia we bought a microwave, because my husband thought there was no way we could get by without one.
hi la tempete, i would give away of freecycle if it was working, but nobody wants a broken one, even for parts.
hi kate, mmmm, i spent a few minutes looking at some *very* schmick new kettles on the 'net last night!
i was useful for reheating leftovers, but now i use the oven efficiently: putting a few things in at a time or just heat stuff quickly in a pan.
i buy a product to do a job.. and when i spend good money i expect it to stay bought, sadly my experience is similar to yours.
we use a stove top kettle but after reading your post i think even that we could just use a pot.
cheers, julie re: the relative efficiencies of electric vs. stove top kettles...
and yes, i've heard that boiling with a gas cooktop (which is what we have) is more efficient than boiling with an electric kettle anyway.
or at the very least a rocket stove such as yours, in case of power outages.
thanks for the link :-) hi belinda, yes exactly, neither product was cheap and nasty when we bought them, and yet they've lasted not much longer - grrrr.
i'm very much looking forward to reclaiming some bench space too!
though it was destroyed eventually by being left on and allowed to boil dry - for a very long time.
cost  ya more to fix it than to buy a new one.
i boiled eggs, boiled veggies and reheated other foods in it to save having to eat in the costly dining room!
when my husband and i got married he had a 20 year old microwave and tv - hand me downs from his parents.
despite the fact that i do all the cooking, and managed to live just fine without a microwave (or an electric kettle) when i first left home (after uni).
in the meantime, does anyone remember  birko food warmers?
been there, hate to see that fixing costs more than buying a new one...most things break down after the garantee expires...just within days after!
but i've found that if i boil the potato for 8-10 minutes and then pop it in the oven for a bit it turns out really nice!
hope this is for you.
i'd like a whistling kettle though, otherwise i'd boil the saucepan dry lol.
eminently useful little gadget  and still going strong.
we caved and bought a brand new oxo.
that should read 'could not' what is the food warmer and how does it work?
i was given an old one when i was a uni student (possibly  it was my grandmother's), and i still have it.
having said that, we only use the microwave for re-heating leftovers,  melting butter for baking and heating milk for our daily coffee, plus it takes  up a lot of bench space...
but i thought heating water on the stove top is a more inefficient use of electricity (on an electric cooker obviously!)
i also like your reasoning re: the longevity.
in my experience, electric kettles come with guaranteed obsolescence.
yes, i had decided some time ago i didn't want to replace this one when it blew up, i'm a not thrilled about irradiating food either, particularly if you've gone to the trouble of growing it!
microwave ovens, i agree with olive so do not own one.
from about three seconds after we came home with it i realised we had indeed made a mistake because we have nowhere to put it.
i don't think i'm going to miss the microwave either.
this week the switch on the electric kettle broke and the four-year-old  microwave stopped working.
the kids just used it for pop corn.
cheers, julie post a comment her blog directory
i tried to give away our last one four years ago but no one touched it for the same reason.
hi paula, yes, it is normally more efficient to use an electric kettle, but we have a gas stovetop which works out about the same because it's more efficient (it doesn't have to heat up the element first)...
if you are trying to find where to  get rid of your broken microwave too, novacastrians can checkhere for local  recycling information, and aussies can checkhere for more information.
but that looks like something dh will be able to fix when it gives out.
hi lorna, thank you :-)
when my kettle "gives up the ghost" i shall buy one from them.
good luck, hope your research goes well.
keep up the wonderful posts!
the type i like look extremely sturdy, brand name staub.
then it'll be good for another 10 years.
hi maggie, thanks :-)
we gave them away when we went overseas for two years.
i'd be very surprised if it lasts for 20 years though.
i hear you about the planned obsolescence.
we nursed it along for quite a while by keeping it on a big plastic lid to catch the run off.
hi cheli, it's like a kettle
our electric kettle started to fail about a year ago, leaking around the base.
this blog is on indefinite  hiatus but please feel free to look around my archives for some inspiration in  your own journey to living more lightly and sustainably.
i am glad i am not alone.
" i think we've all been  there before.
i've been following your blog for a short time now and enjoy it very much!
or eat it cold of course.
saves it from landfill!
wednesday, january 27, 2010 planned obsolescence... ...makes me want to shout rude words.
i don't think they're used too much anymore.
wow, that staub kettle is awesome, i didn't know you could still buy cast iron ones!
than an electric kettle.
unless your stove top range costs more than a plug in kettle.
the doomers among us could argue that the electric kettle will be useless after the crash, while the stove top kettle will eventually be used on a wood stove.
surely radiated food can not be good for one's health (to my way of thinking)
it's a pity that they tend to be collectible and  therefore expensive though.
this  is the online journal i kept until recently, of how we are trying to live more  simply & sustainably in suburbia.
planned obsolescence has to be the most destructive part of the current company/product/profits system.
i loath the standard mechanism of planned obsolescense that keeps industry moving.
the weak spot is going to be the fancy handle, i can tell.
we are living abroad for a temporary period of time so we didn't want to put a lot of money into appliances we wouldn't be taking back with us.
we have been without a microwave since we moved to a new house 6 months ago.
we duly ring the closest electrical repair centre (a  half-hour drive away), to be told "nah mate, we don't touch kettles, you  need an electrician", and "sounds like your magnetron has gone.
don't forget about freecycle, to get rid of or replace any goods.
just something to consider hi shandora, oh yes, how many things break just days after the warranty expires!
but with an enclosed element at the bottom - sort of like an electric saucepan?
hi queen stuss, argh, yes.
about me recipe index i'm julie, and i live with my  husband and three young daughters in new south wales suburbia, australia.
yes, if i didn't have the birko we'd be using a saucepan!

i had an old microwave when we first got married too, it sounded like a nuclear power plant starting up when we operated it lol, but it was still going strong when we replaced it with a smaller one - which blew up about 12 months later...
isn't the birko cool?
doesn't get any less frustrating each time it happens.
good morning julie, good idea to go without a microwave oven.
i have convinced my hubby that the microwave should go, and the clothes dryer is not coming with us when we move.
it's amazing how many "essential" appliances we can live without when we want to, isn't it?
and i think i have convinced hubby that we really  don't need a new one.
we got a stove top kettle.
i had a birko when i was living in a hostel in canberra.
i had a birko when i first left home, loved it.
so even if there's a slightly higher energy cost to boiling on the stove top, you may still come out ahead or at least break even.
some lovely solid-looking ones, with lifetime guarantees too, so that will be our fall-back.
kind regards belinda hi julie, you will be fine without a microwave, we have never owned one though my mum lent us hers when our stove was out of action and to be honest i could figure how to make it part of my meal preparation routine.
hi julie i love your articles.
especially the pictures from your garden :)
my engineer husband then took it apart and tried to fix it, including speaking with a stunned service rep at the manufacturer, and tracking down a particular o-ring, all to no avail.
with a name like that how could it not be sturdy lol.
surely a pot of water on the stove can work as a kettle?
hi jenny, thanks, i'm sure i'll only miss it about once a month when i'm in a rush lol.
as for the kettle, i've been looking for an affordable  vintage stove-top kettle for ages, so it sounds like it's time to get more  intense about that search!
it takes up so much bench space for... me to reheat food once or twice a week (could do that on the stove), and cook vegetables once or twice a week, or less because i like them better steamed.
if the stove top kettle lasts for 40 years and is still functional, you ought to compare that to the monetary and environmental costs of making and buying 5-8 electric kettles in that time period.
