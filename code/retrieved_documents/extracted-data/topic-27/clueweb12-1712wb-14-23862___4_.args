cooking does not account for a large amount of energy use, and an electric stove is about twice as efficient as a gas stove.a gas water heater is also less efficient than a heat pump water heater but may be less costly to operate than an existing electric water heater.bringing gas into the home or keeping oil presents risks for carbon monoxide poisoning and gas/oil leaks.cooking with gas releases more pollutants in the house and it would be best to have a better functioning kitchen exhaust fan in that scenario.at current energy prices, a high efficiency gas furnace would cost half as much as an oil furnace and an inverter driven heat pump would cost about a third as much as an oil furnace.a switch from oil provides tremendous positive opportunities for homeowners.inverter driven heat pumps can modulate their fans and heaters to perfectly match the heating demands of the house.while the upfront costs of some of these options are significantly higher than others, the added efficiency of these more expensive heaters will pay for themselves over time.one benefit to the ductless system is that you can locally heat one part of the house instead of heating the entire house with a forced air system.the gas and oil furnace is a fossil fuel and the heat pump could run on renewable energy sources.a house that needs less heat also requires a smaller furnace so you can save money by buying a smaller heater if you have already done work to keep heat inside the house.locally heating is more efficient than heating the entire house.the heat pump can operate in reverse and provide cooling in the summer time.the ductless units are good for heating large open spaces like your living room/kitchen/entry area.natural gas and oil furnaces would lock you into one fuel type; a heat pump could be powered by many different fuel types depending on what the utility chooses to generate.
