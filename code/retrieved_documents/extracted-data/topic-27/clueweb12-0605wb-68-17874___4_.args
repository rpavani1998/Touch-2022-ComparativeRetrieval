we could all use a better high temperature (refractory), high insulation, convenient, cheap material.some of the mix left over was left outside in all weathers and showed scant sign of deterioration over years of exposure.beech is too combustible to be much good on an open hearth Â while oak beams commonly survive a house that burns down.beech is too combustible to be much good on an open hearth while oak beams commonly survive a house that burns down.if wood is dry, stove well heated, and red embers are present, one can burn a single log at a time.; they are more fire resistant than steel girders, which twist and collapse.this is built up on the inside of the stove walls on expanded metal lath, which is self-supporting and provides a better key than multiple layers of chicken-wire mesh.the smallest of these stoves has seen twelve years' service, and last summer i hastily, and probably unnecessarily, patched up some minor cracks in the refractory lining.the asian institute of technology (ait) and bob reines have been pushing "ferrocement" as a construction material for gasifiers (and could be stoves).as mentioned, the main domestic fuel here is oak logs, preferably seasoned.my domestic heating consists of cheap, cylindrical, thin-walled steel stoves burning oak logs, the usual fuel in country areas round here (the foothills of the pyrenees).i have lined these stoves using refractory mortar, 'ready-mixed' and doubtless containing high alumina cement, of the type sold by builders' merchants for barbecues etc.more economical, since better control over rate of burning.ferro-cement : my domestic heating consists of cheap, cylindrical, thin-walled steel stoves burning oak logs, the usual fuel in country areas round here (the foothills of the pyrenees).the motive for this : it was falling apart ; but it has also greatly improved the comfort.
