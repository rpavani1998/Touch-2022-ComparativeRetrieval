these rules against camping are mainly designed to get everyone to use the facilities for motorists, but they foolishly prevent people, especially children, from enjoying the woods who would otherwise more strongly support those parks and forests.the solution, in my opinion, is to buy a stove that does not require a special fuel, to be careful about not spilling fuel, and to not breathe the fumes from the stove (which would be hazardous even with coleman fuel).trespass laws are especially used against hunters, homeless people, dumpers, and vandals, as getting a conviction for trespass is easier than getting a conviction for any actual crime.there's not that many campers, they do little harm, and they create a fire hazard in only a few regions and/or times of year (campers with stoves create no hazard).therefore (and also because of my sense of civic responsibility and my love of nature), i cannot cut any trees or shrubs, start any fires, leave any trash, disturb any farm animals, or leave open any closed gates.of course, camping alone in the woods requires me to be a little more self-reliant and knowledgeable and to carry more equipment, especially more water.laws like this one and the decision in illinois that cyclists "are not the intended users of the road" violate the principles of common law and common sense and will probably be overturned.in using one pot to cook in, i just cook everything together, adding the ingredients at separate times, so that they'll each receive the proper amount of cooking.a good way to prepare for a trip would be to cook the kind of foods that you are going to eat in the same pot and even on the same stove, butuse the camp stove only out of doors away from any fire hazard, and don't breathe the fumes.while i never did learn the art of fine cooking, i learned how to cook practical, simple meals for myself, and i have cooked most of my meals since i was 17.one quart of boiling hot water is enough to kill someone (cold water is the best remedy for hot water or a burn).some national forests have problems with people living on them, so they have a two-week camping limit as a result.under this bill, which passed into law, a hiker or hunter lost in the woods may be held liable (a civil forfeiture of up to $1,000) for mistakenly wandering onto someones unposted property."on some roads and in some regions, finding a camping spot is so easy that the only problem is picking the best one.on the other hand, most people just use the top of the ground and leave their wastes exposed to flies, a very unsanitary and unsightly method.
