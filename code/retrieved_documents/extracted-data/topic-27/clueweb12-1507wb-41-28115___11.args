it is important to buy the right sized stove (a large stove in a small room always ends up being turned down low and creates much more creosote) and burning the right kind of fuel at the right temperature (smokeless fuel or dry hard wood

as most stoves have 5” or 6” size outlets, what this means for most of us is that the liner must be either 6”, 7” or 8” diameter.
it is clearly unsatisfactory to simply slot a smaller stove pipe inside a larger clay or concrete liner (even with a register plate below) as the tar will not run down the inside of the pipe into the stove to re-burn but down the outside of the pipe onto the plate or appliance.

the price of a visit depends on the distance for an engineer (please telephone us for more information) but in most cases it will not prove necessary.
the reasons for this are simple, and for your safety and the safety of others (as fireman sam would tell you!).

we are therefore unable to organise installations using others’ components.
we can’t cover all the details here but please don’t simply assume one kind is right for you based on price or a sales description (or the fact your fitter happens to have some in their garage); give us a call so we can talk you through the strengths and limitations of the liner choice you are making.

burned hot is best).
and it can melt to liquid and drip down into fireplaces and on top of stoves.
as long as we are confident that the stove complies with british regulations and is compatible with our flue components we are normally happy to organise its installation within our local area.
customers purchasing both the stove and the fitting components from us will of course be given priority especially during the busy season.
this is either done through a twin-wall system (when there is no existing chimney at all) or through the use of a metal liner dropped down an existing masonry chimney.
harridge stoves is hetas registered but not oftec.
the more you control and turn down the burn of your fuel the more creosote you start to create.
if you do not have prior experience with these kinds of installations then please speak to us before making any decisions or purchases.
the placement of a chimney is more science than art (whatever the architect envisions!)
any surprises on the day (should the chimney turn out to be much taller than was indicated for example) are always dealt with fairly and should an installation prove to be impossible within the allotted budget then the work and stove purchase (if applicable) would be cancelled at no cost to the customer.
twin-wall is insulated flue which can be used instead of a masonry chimney.
so they are less likely to condense into creosote in the first place.
a beautiful stove with an attractively placed chimney is no good whatsoever if it fills the room with smoke!
these components are more expensive than ordinary chimney lining work and the location of the stove needs to be thought about carefully in order to ensure the chimney is able to function well.
most people choose to buy a stove because they know they will get much more heat from much less fuel than with their open fire.
since the ends of clay and concrete liners are not standardised, neither are adaptors.
the difficulty with this kind of an installation is the connection at the bottom of the liner into the metal stove pipe and the stove.
then we are confident of its quality and have direct channels of communication with the manufacturer.
the benefits of a metal liner are that it keeps the flue gases warm and moving quickly at a fixed (small) diameter
if you don’t live in any of the above areas then please refer to the hetas website where a list of qualified installers can be found, or contact your local chimney sweep who will usually know a good person!
if you live locally to any of our showrooms then we will be glad to recommend a hetas registered installer and even to liaise with them and organise your installation for you.

should this be the case with an existing clay or concrete lining it should be properly smoke-spillage and core-ball tested and, provided it passes, it can normally be legally connected to, whether it can be done practically however is another question... the difficulty with this kind of an installation is the connection at the bottom of the liner into the metal stove pipe and the stove.

you can get this certificate in one of two ways – if a hetas registered engineer installs the stove they will issue one themselves; if a non-registered person installs it (for example you or your builder) then it must be done through your local council and a building inspector will need to inspect the installation and issue the certification.
liners can be swept successfully and closely by a small brush head which can normally be pushed up through the appliance or through a flue access door.
the building regulations require that (in most circumstances) a chimney lining is no smaller than 6” diameter and no larger than 2” greater than the outlet size of the appliance that is installed.
creosote is the black tar-like substance you sometimes find in chimneys – open fires can cause it, fire-boxes often do, but stoves are the real culprit!
it will provide information of the installer, the materials used and the date of the installation so that a person working on the stove or chimney later has access to all the details they need.
our fitters are hetas approved therefore should you chose to have your stove fitted by us there will be no need to get a further visit from a building regs inspector.
