all appliances have two costs - the purchase price, and the operating cost, or the money that you pay out month after month, year after year, in the form of your utility bills.
that  on-going expense is important to consider, for it may be as much or more than  the purchase price.
match the size of the pan to the heating element; more heat will get to the pan and less will be lost to the surrounding air or found by the pan handle!
they also save  on your rubber glove and cleanser purchases!
