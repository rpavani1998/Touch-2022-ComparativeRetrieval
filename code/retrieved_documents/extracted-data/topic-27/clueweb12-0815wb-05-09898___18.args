generators use almost the same fuel at half load as almost idle, so loading them up provides the best fuel economy, fastest re-charge time, and less run hours.
the water pressure and flow rate will determine the size of the pump.
most very basic stoves with no electronic displays or timers, will have a spark ignition system that uses little or no electricity except for the brief period the valve triggers the spark.
300 yards away from nearest power box.
this will be two separate strings of 4 batteries to make 24 volts each, then wired in parallel.
i have done a great deal of reading and it seems that there should be some batteries in parallel, plus the panels need to be wired some in parallel.
to this post tags: igniter, off-grid, propane range, spark posted in igniter, propane, range solar problem – parallel or series wednesday, october 29th, 2008 we have a 1 kw off grid system.
we use fluorescent lights- 4 in all, plus propane refrigerator and stove and solar hot water.
there are now both ac and dc wind turbines and each has its advantages, but only in wiring and additional equipment that will be required.
we always try to use the highest voltage battery as possible, as this results in the lowest amp current flow, which allows using the smallest wire size, and inverters designed for higher voltage can use smaller components as the currents will be lower.
this will have a total capacity to power ( watts = amps x volts) =
i have watched low cost generators run for hours and not do any charging at all.
i need to place a timer on the system, but the water pressure is too low for the valve to work.
the recent introduction of mppt solar charge controllers now allow using a higher voltage solar array than the battery bank as it will adjust the voltage and current as required for the best charging output.
when you start getting above 8 batteries of any size, its better to switch to a larger amp-hr battery and stay less than 16, as this can cause problems with un-even charging and dis-charging when you have multiple strings of parallel batteries.
this will be two separate strings of 4 batteries to make 24 volts each, then wired in parallel.
after completion, the generator had to run several hours every day to avoid a drained battery each night.
assuming you have the worlds greatest generator, if your inverter is programmed wrong it will take for ever to re-charge.
they say if you ask an engineer what time it is, they will tell you how to build a watch.
before i challenge the solar guy, i wanted some advice.
since ge loves electricity, they designed their gas stove with a “glow plate” down next to the oven burner which glows cherry red the entire time the oven is operating!
the same would be true if we re-wired them for 12 volts, you will still have the same total power capacity.
you can use a digital volt meter for this, but these readings need to be taken when the battery is under a modest load.
a 6-volt deep cycle battery will have the same storage capacity regardless of how it is wired.
jeff yagoshare this entry hello jeff, putting together an off-grid system, i am inquiring as to how best choose/purchase the solar panels for optimal efficiency in relation to their voltage output.
frequent watering indicates failing batteries if the charger is working correctly.
mark mark: being totally off-grid is not as easy as you think unless you have lots of solar modules and batteries, and really limit the use or quantity of larger appliances.
if you are adding water to your batteries more than once every 3 or 4 months, either your charger is programmed to high or your batteries are getting old.
yes, this will require a larger wire size since the voltage is lower, but the ease of wiring is its real advantage.
not connected, most 12 volt nominal solar modules will have an open circuit voltage around 21 volts.
i would use only a few low wattage compact fluorescent and mostly led lights for lighting, and buy only very energy efficient short wave radio, flat screen tv, computer, and video equipment.
you appear to be in a warm climate, and this requires “lower” charging set-points for both your solar charge controller and your inverter charger set-points when using the generator.
if you have 7 new batteries and 1 dead battery, the battery bank will never charge right.
now before all those other “experts” out there read this and start sending nasty email back (yes, it happens all the time even knowing this is a free site!), i need to explain.
with interest i have read about l-16 industrial batteries for a battery bank in some articles.
a much better way is to use a hydrometer.
the first thing you need to do is really limit your electrical usage.
carie wingert carie: i guess you already considered the obvious, move the water pillow to higher ground and you won’t need the pump!
a fill up once a year to a 500 gallon underground tank should not only give you many months of backup power, but can also be used in a gas stove since you will not be able to have an electric stove in an off-grid home.
not connected, most 12 volt nominal solar modules will have an open circuit voltage around 21 volts.
for comparison purposes, inverters designed for grid-tie sell-back without batteries are usually a little more efficient than inverters designed to charge a battery bank, but this is not the real reason you would choose one over the other.
the actual electrical use is very low, but the system constantly fails- that is, it gets so low we have to shut everything down and run the generator.
another problem in wiring batteries for smaller voltages is you need multiple series strings.
for simplicity, let’s imagine a 2kw grid-tie system can be installed complete for $12,000, with no battery back-up.
jeff yagoshare this entry dear jeff, having recently bought some land in missouri that is located out the the sticks and very much at the end of the power grid.
in series, the amp-hours do not change.
hope this helps, jeff yagoshare this entry hi jeff, i need to power a 12 volt dc pump with solar power and i’m not sure how to do it.
an ac generator can use a standard ac power cord and suffers no loss in current between the tower and batteries.
no one has asked us what we need; they simply tell us what the system will be.
due to high cost, your inverter voltage will determine the battery voltage.
so instead of doing grid tie solar, i am now contemplating off grid solar and looking at generators for backup.
if you live in an area that has gone weeks at a time without power due to yearly storm damage, you have the peace of mind that any future storm will have only a minor impact on your lifestyle or perhaps your home-based business.
if this process does not give you the solar array you want, then you will need to make changes to the inverter if grid tied, or the solar charge controller if a battery based system.
lets say 400 amp-hrs to keep it simple.
most people use a “slightly” higher voltage solar array when there is a very long wire run between the solar array and the batteries to off-set the voltage loss of the long wire.
needless to say, we sent this stove back and had the homeowner purchase a non-electric model.
if all this checks out just fine, then you may have the classic solar home problem i see every day – the small system was designed to run a few lights and appliances, then each year you add more load or use them longer hours each day and pretty soon you start complaining the system just does not provide the power it did when first installed.
lets use an example, a typical l-16 battery will have 350 to 425 amp-hours depending on weight (lead) and manufacturer.
these are low cost and will allow an equal loading across all individual batteries that would not be the case if you wired them to only part of the large voltage battery bank.
other than lights, all that is powered off the system are a cd player, charging cellphones, a hairdryer in the morning for about 3-5 minutes, and a shop vac during the day occasionally for about 15-20 minutes.
the water was trucked in and put into a water pillow.
they are about the same size as a car battery, but because they are 6-volt, the plates are very thick and very heavy.
problem is, we don’t want the pilot light burning all the time, and the existing spark igniters are all electric!
there are panels that put out similar wattage, however the vp/imp can vary greatly.
sorry you are having so many problems, it should not be that way, i hope this helps.
in series, the amp-hours do not change.
once that has been determined you can select the solar array size that will provide this amount of power per day.
frequent watering indicates failing batteries if the charger is working correctly.
if we wire 8 batteries in series, we will have a 48 volt battery with a total amp-hour capacity of — 400 amp-hours!
the actual electrical use is very low, but the system constantly fails- that is, it gets so low we have to shut everything down and run the generator.

jon jon, as we say on the web site, we cannot answer specific design questions because there are too many variables we would not know about your specific application, and we are trying to keep this a free service.
i have watched low cost generators run for hours and not do any charging at all.
the problem is, the more strings you have, the more risk there is of un-equal charging between each parallel string.
several manufactures for dc refrigerators only offer a 12 volt or 24 volt model, not 48 volts, so this is usually why some systems must have lower voltage batteries.
when using an inverter that has programmed charging set-points, i try to increase the charging current amps up to the point i almost stall the generator, then back off a few amps.
like they say, you can have any 2 of 3 order choices - fast delivery, quality construction, cheap price, pick two!
for example, if one battery in one string is starting to fail, or just does not charge as well as the others, this will cause that entire string to receive less than its share of the charging current.
wind power is not an option either, as the data shows less than 5 mph, year round.
this means the they are wired just like the batteries in the battery bank, you wire them to give the output voltage to match the battery voltage, and this may require several separate strings.
if you on the utility grid but in an area where there are lots of power outages, it provides the peace of mind that your freezer, lights, and other appliances will continue to operate during brief power interruptions.
i would next dis-connect the solar array from the batteries and check their output voltage, then check again after they are connected to the charger.
like our example above, it would take 4 separate “strings” to wire your 8 batteries if you wanted a 12 volt battery bank.
this means you need to find ways to keep the generator area above freezing.
i have found that most “contractor” type portable generators do not work well with inverters when charging batteries, its just they way they are designed to control their output voltage.
the same would be true if we re-wired them for 12 volts, you will still have the same total power capacity.
you can use a digital volt meter for this, but these readings need to be taken when the battery is under a modest load.
lets use an example, a typical l-16 battery will have 350 to 425 amp-hours depending on weight (lead) and manufacturer.
take the total delivered price of a specific module and divide by nameplate wattage to get the $cost/watt.
we’re from alaska and thinking about buying 20 acres where electricity is nowhere to be seen.
in other words, if your solar charge controller has a limit of 75 volts dc input, this will require the number of solar modules wired in series to be well below this high limit.
if you have a few 12 volt dc loads like lights, you can still use a 24 volt battery and install a dc to dc converter.
another problem in wiring batteries for smaller voltages is you need multiple series strings.
if all this checks out just fine, then you may have the classic solar home problem i see every day – the small system was designed to run a few lights and appliances, then each year you add more load or use them longer hours each day and pretty soon you start complaining the system just does not provide the power it did when first installed.
maybe your inverter can only operate on 24 volts, or you have a bunch of 12 volt lights.
it is also possible for a single battery to fail, then all the other strings will “see” this as a load and start moving massive currents into that string, just like they were chargers.
batteries absorb energy measured in amp-hours, and they supply your loads by sending these amp-hours back out.
it seems that i need a pump controller, but the ones i have found cost several hundred dollars and don’t look anything like the one inyour article on solar water pumps.
i would not try and modify your gas stove.
due to high cost, your inverter voltage will determine the battery voltage.
assuming you have the worlds greatest generator, if your inverter is not programmed wrong it will take for ever to re-charge.
you appear to be in a warm climate, and this requires “lower” charging set-points for both your solar charge controller and your inverter charger set-points when using the generator.
we always try to use the highest voltage battery as possible, as this results in the lowest amp current flow, which allows using the smallest wire size, and inverters designed for higher voltage can use smaller components as the currents will be lower.
solar array – most solar modules under 100 watts are 17 volts output (ideal voltage for charging a 12 volt battery plus some efficiency loss).
if this array is wired for a 24 volt battery, you should see 42 volts, and for a 48 volt battery you should read 84 volts.
sounds like diesel is the way to go for reliability and low maintenance, which is my biggest goal.
solar systems can work that far north for the periods of the year when the sun shines, but a generator-battery system will be needed the rest of the year.
if you are adding water to your batteries more than once every 3 or 4 months, either your charger is programmed to high or your batteries are getting old.
i need to feed water into an irrigation system in a remote location where there is no water or electricity on-site (it’s for a native habitat restoration project).
this will have a total capacity to power ( watts = amps x volts)
we cannot run the washer w/o the generator.
this can even cause the failed battery to get so hot it will melt down, so less strings is better.
the easy solution is to light a match every time i want to light a burner, but i’m wondering if there isn’t a way to modify (or build) a non-electric spark igniter that sparks when i turn the burner on (or that is powered by a couple of aa batteries).
a 24 or 48 volt dc output wind turbine is very easy to add to an existing solar-power system, and some models have built-in charge controllers and can be hooked directly to the batteries.
let’s imagine for example the system objective is approximately 2kw using a 24v to 110v inverter with battery back-up.
i have pretty well deduced that i will need some back up power.
after re-connecting to the battery, it will be more like 27 to 29 volts into a 24 volt battery, and 54 to 59 volts into a 48 volt battery.
this way there is no pilot light wasting gas.
if you are in an area without grid power, it provides peace of mind of having reliable power without running a generator 24 hours per day.
jeff yagoshare this entry we have a 1 kw off grid system.
the maximum input amp rating of the solar charge controller (or inverter if grid tie) will determine the maximum number of parallel strings and total amps from the array after the required nec design multipliers are added.
however, if you do not also upgrade the transmission, tires, drive shaft, fuel system, exhaust system, and brake system, then the vehicle cannot take advantage of the higher horsepower.
rather than use a wood burning stove, i want to install propane and get a propane range.
no one has asked us what we need; they simply tell us what the system will be.
an ac wind turbine can use a smaller wire size since the voltage is higher, and these are usually designed for grid-connect systems without batteries.
once you know this maximum total array wattage, you want to select the highest quality module you can buy that has the lowest cost per watt.
the fuel does not go stale, it does not freeze, and you don’t have to worry about it turning into a semi-solid in the fuel lines.
once you know the maximum voltage and maximum current your system can safely handle, this will define the solar array that your system can handle.
as one who is not totally familiar with alternative power like wind and solar, everything i read seems only to confuse me more.
all this equipment is off-the shelf, but is not cheap.
after checking every circuit, we discovered their general electric propane gas stove used more electricity than the entire house!
if your goal for installing a solar system is to provide the most utility cost savings for the lowest initial cost, then any grid-tie system without batteries will have the lowest cost and will provide the shortest payback.
i hope i have not done that with your question, but we need to first dispel this battle you are in about battery voltage.
your solar charge controller may have a meter to provide this information.
also the battery bank issue of l-16 versus marine batteries is very confusing to a novice seeking information like myself.
these are low cost and will allow an equal loading across all individual batteries that would not be the case if you wired them to only part of the large voltage battery bank.
if there is even a slight drop in generator output voltage your inverter will not just have a lower charging output, it may not charge at all.
i have done a great deal of reading and it seems that there should be some batteries in parallel, plus the panels need to be wired some in parallel.
lets say 400 amp-hrs to keep it simple.
it is also possible for a single battery to fail, then all the other strings will “see” this as a load and start moving massive currents into that string, just like they were chargers.
assuming you have the worlds greatest generator, if your inverter is programmed wrong it will take for ever to re-charge.
gail stebbins gail: there is no difference in total battery capacity regardless of wiring in series, parallel, or series-parallel.
you did not mention if this is a drip system not requiring very much water pressure, or some type of spray heads that require higher pressure.
again, things are never simple as you think, because our desire to have only one battery string and a higher voltage may not match your loads.
having proven that fact this does not mean they are not real differences with each layout.
the last thing i would check is the charging current when using the generator.
however, this advantage was not intended to allow using a high voltage solar array to charge a 24 volt battery.
having proven that fact this does not mean they are not real differences with each layout.
having said that, depending on your solar exposure and location, the more solar you have the less generator run time so fuel type may not be a big issue.
the problem is, the more strings you have, the more risk there is of un-equal charging between each parallel string.
in searching around i have found a source for a ac wind generator that begins operation in the sub 7knot range.
i would not have any heating system that requires operating a central fan or air handing unit as these require lots of power.
most people use a “slightly” higher voltage solar array when there is a very long wire run between the solar array and the batteries to off-set the voltage loss of the long wire.
this is why many backup generators are propane.
now before all those other “experts” out there read this and start sending nasty email back (yes, it happens all the time even knowing this is a free site!), i need to explain.
people buy a more expensive battery-based solar system because it provides peace of mind.
i would next check charging set-points.
i would like to avoid using batteries, if possible.
again, there are many technical reasons for using different voltage arrays, different voltage battery banks, and different voltage loads, but you can’t say one way will have much less capacity than another as long as you are comparing the same components and just wiring them differently.
so i’m going to install a surface pump to push water through the valve and i need to power it with solar power.
if your inverter and other dc loads are 24 volts dc, then your battery must be wired for 24 volts dc.
there is no engineering difference in the amount of wind it takes to turn a wind turbine based on ac or dc output voltage.
again, there are many technical reasons for using different voltage arrays, different voltage battery banks, and different voltage loads, but you can’t say one way will have much less capacity than another as long as you are comparing the same components and just wiring them differently.
although wind power as such is confusing to me i believe that this ac system must be quite good or the farmer who had added to it and bought these generators would not be doing so if they weren’t efficient.
if you have 7 new batteries and 1 dead battery, the battery bank will never charge right.
if your inverter and other dc loads are 24 volts dc, then your battery must be wired for 24 volts dc.
if this is the case adding more batteries may not help if your solar array is too small for your loads.
i would next dis-connect the solar array from the batteries and check their output voltage, then check again after they are connected to the charger.
when i suggest using an rv/marine battery, you will find that it is for a small 12-volt dc system that does not have a large load that would fully discharge it each day.
for these larger loads and system sizes, the lowest cost battery designed for a heavy charge/discharge cycling each day is a 6-volt golf cart battery ( t-105 size).
check to see how much electric ignition and controls draw when off, and then when energizing the spark ignition.
wind energy is a “cubic” function of the area of the blades, and below around 7 mph i think you will find most small-scale generators will not provide any real power, although the blades might turn.
comments may appear online in "feedback" or in the "letters" section of backwoods home magazine.
however, we designed an off-grid solar-powered home several years ago that based on our calculations would only need the generator to run about 3 hours once a week.
unfortunately, i do not think that the experts on kauai really analyze load, etc.
also, unless you are talking about some huge wind machine on a 150-foot tower, the difference in wire costs would most likely be less than 50 cents per foot for the larger wire caused by using a lower voltage dc model.
batteries do not like the cold, so they need to be above freezing.
if this is the case adding more batteries may not help if your solar array is too small for your loads.
if you don’t spend the money to do this right, you will most likely have some dead plants when the lower cost system fails.
ac generators have to best of my knowledge a big advantage over dc generators and that is in size of the cable between the transmission line from the tower to the battery bank.
unfortunately, i do not think that the experts on kauai really analyze load, etc.
when using an inverter that has programmed charging set-points, i try to increase the charging current amps up to the point i almost stall the generator, then back off a few amps.
again, things are never simple as you think, because our desire to have only one battery string and a higher voltage may not match your loads.
this means the they are wired just like the batteries in the battery bank, you wire them to give the output voltage to match the battery voltage, and this may require several separate strings.
since rv/marine batteries are easy to find and will take to repeated charging wouldn’t they be logical choice for a battery bank vice the harder to find l-16?
any information you can provide along these lines would be greatly appreciated.
they way they are designed to control their output voltage.
a 6-volt deep cycle battery will have the same storage capacity regardless of how it is wired.
people place a high value for this peace of mind and do not calculate this in terms of payback or return on investment, just like you would not purchase a fire extinguisher or security system based on a cash flow analysis.
solar array – most solar modules under 100 watts are 17 volts output (ideal voltage for charging a 12 volt battery plus some efficiency loss).
after re-connecting to the battery, it will be more like 27 to 29 volts into a 24 volt battery, and 54 to 59 volts into a 48 volt battery.
i hope i have not done that with your question, but we need to first dispel this battle you are in about battery voltage.
however, this advantage was not intended to allow using a high voltage solar array to charge a 24 volt battery.
i assume you will be using a wood, oil, or propane cook stove, space heater, and water heater.
you must have a solar controller wired between the solar array and pump, and several safety devices like a low water cut off to protect the pump if the water bladder runs out of water.
24 x 400 = 9600 watts capacity per each parallel string, so in this case the amp-hrs are added, or 2 x 9600 = 19,200 watt-hrs.
first, there are many things that go into the design process and the first is inverter input limits if grid tie, and solar charge controller input limits if battery based.
maybe your inverter can only operate on 24 volts, or you have a bunch of 12 volt lights.
batteries absorb energy measured in amp-hours, and they supply your loads by sending these amp-hours back out.
however, they will not hold up to a daily deep charge/discharge cycling like a solar powered home or cabin.
if you have a few 12 volt dc loads like lights, you can still use a 24 volt battery and install a dc to dc converter.
we said this was not possible, and returned to the site with full metering equipment.
i have found that most “contractor” type portable generators do not work well with inverters when charging batteries, its just
in other words, its like taking a car and trying to replace the engine with a bigger engine to get more power.
your case – you said your batteries were replaced, but if i were there, i would first check each battery to make sure they are all good.
good luck, jeff yagoshare this entry jeff, interested in knowing the economics comparison between a grid-tie v. off-grid system.
generators use almost the same fuel at half load as almost idle, so loading them up provides the best fuel economy, fastest re-charge time, and less run hours.
http://www.tlgwindpower.com/default.htm on the opening page there is a photo of a customer using 9 ac wind generators on his farm in wisconsin.
if there is even a slight drop in generator output voltage your inverter will not just have a lower charging output, it may not charge at all.
i don’t know your pump size, but most small dc pressure pumps will cost over $1,000, plus about $2,000 for the solar array and another $600 for the controls, plus some type of pole support for the solar array.
if this array is wired for a 24 volt battery, you should see 42 volts, and for a 48 volt battery you should read 84 volts.
your solar charge controller may have a meter to provide this information.
a much better way is to use a hydrometer.
like our example above, it would take 4 separate “strings” to wire your 8 batteries if you wanted a 12 volt battery bank.
these batteries are much heavier duty than a typical car battery, and most have re-combiner caps and do not need to add water.
however, not only bio-diesel, but regular diesel fuels can be a real problem during the winter unless you use crank case heaters, fuel pre-heaters, and other heating devices to prevent the fuel from turning into gel.
assuming that has been considered, it’s not a problem to install a solar panel, dc pump, dc timer, and dc valve.
i have noticed too that with wind power most often suggested is a dc wind generator that requires upwards of 6 or 7 knots of wind to operate.
i do not know how the panels are wired, but we are told that they total 1050 watts-
we read every email you send us, but due to the sheer volume of mail we receive, we can't respond to each one.
your case – you said your batteries were replaced, but if i were there, i would first check each battery to make sure they are all good.
we cannot run the washer w/o the generator.
assuming you have the worlds greatest generator, if your inverter is not programmed wrong it will take for ever to re-charge.
i do not know how the panels are wired, but we are told that they total 1050 watts-
the last thing i would check is the charging current when using the generator.
also an off-grid system can be installed complete for the same price of $12,000 inclusive of battery bank.
we use fluorescent lights- 4 in all, plus propane refrigerator and stove and solar hot water.
gail stebbins gail: there is no difference in total battery capacity regardless of wiring in series, parallel, or series-parallel.
the recent introduction of mppt solar charge controllers now allow using a higher voltage solar array than the battery bank as it will adjust the voltage and current as required for the best charging output.
i have spent a good deal of time searching the internet, but i can’t figure out if i can hook the solar panel directly into the pump (i don’t need to water at night).
you must lower your energy needs first, and it’s worth paying extra for the higher efficiency devices.
several manufactures for dc refrigerators only offer a 12 volt or 24 volt model, not 48 volts, so this is usually why some systems must have lower voltage batteries.
they say if you ask an engineer what time it is, they will tell you how to build a watch.
sharlynn sharlynn, you guys are in a tough place.
some diesel engine manufacturers will void their warranty if you use bio-diesel, although this is changing as manufacturers get more experience with bio and the quality of the fuel processing improves.
for example, if one battery in one string is starting to fail, or just does not charge as well as the others, this will cause that entire string to receive less than its share of the charging current.
this can even cause the failed battery to get so hot it will melt down, so less strings is better.
diesel generators do not start when it drops below freezing unless you use crankcase and carburetor heaters, and you cannot run these high energy loads 24/7 on battery power.
if you think solar is expensive just to run a few appliances and lights in an off-grid home, wait and see what it will cost you in batteries and solar modules just to power a crank case heater on a diesel generator all winter !
yet, there are lots of battery based solar systems sold each year and the reason is very simple.
any solar system with batteries cost more for the inverter and switchgear, costs more for the batteries, requires battery maintenance, takes up valuable heated interior space that could be used for other purposes, the costly batteries must be replaced every few years, and as stated above, the inverters are less efficient in sell-back mode.
