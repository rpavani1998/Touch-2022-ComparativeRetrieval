they are excellent stoves having a much higher btu mostly due to their much larger physical size.then comes the hard work of teaching people that wax can be much more then a candle and is a very potent high density, safe alternative fuel source.this is only possible because, unlike any other small stove, the wax fuel is hardened and will not spill or flair up.or just someone who wants the security of having a fire making device that can be fueled with candle wax chips in calamity, disaster or vehicle break down it's a life saver.like any stove device a wind screen is a good tool to have outside if there is wind.when fitted with a glass lantern globe and the flame is not covered with a pot there is absolutely zero soot.however,  if the flame height is adjusted correctly the mostly white / blue flame will not deposit soot.you'd do better with a whisperlite or any preasurised liquid fuel stove for winter use.inventors note; the g-micro psl is not intended to replace the present crop of turbocharged pressurized gas stoves when used under normal circumstances.wax is inert, nontoxic, and lightweight yet as powerful as kerosene!as a matter of fact, because of the g-micro psl's small size, one of our greatest engineering challenges was to throttle back gas production enough to produce a clean soot free flame.yes you will get some soot on the pot but this is normal for any high molecular weight fuel.to answer your question the g-micro psl is not a candle and is different in many ways the most obvious is it that it does not have a consumable wick like a wax candle and it has a metallic burner element (watch our video) that burns paraffin wax gas.for an explorer like todd carmichael  www.subzerosolo.com  (check out his photo page) who carries two g-micro psl's in his kit it's an enabler.however, for the uncompromising minimalist who wants to toss a g-micro and fuel in his / her pocket and is content with waiting a few more minutes for 2 cups of water to boil then later use it for illumination / lantern there is no equal.
