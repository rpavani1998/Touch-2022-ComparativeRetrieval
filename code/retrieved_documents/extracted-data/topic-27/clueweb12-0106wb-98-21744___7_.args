by cooking food at a higher temperature and pressure, cooking time is reduced dramatically and energy use is cut by 50 to 75 percent.convection ovens distribute heat more evenly than ordinary ovens, so cooking time and cooking temperatures can be reduced, cutting energy use by about a third, on average.a gas stove costs less than half as much to operate as an electric one, provided it is equipped with electronic ignition instead of a pilot light.food cooks more quickly and efficiently when the heated air can circulate freely.they will reflect heat better and save energy.food cooks more quickly and efficiently when heat circulates freely.today, about 58 percent of american households cook with electricity, but gas cooking is making a steady comeback, for good reason.in addition, a clean seal will provide better heat retention.they use less energy for normal cooking because of higher insulation levels.keep stovetop burners and reflectors clean - they will reflect the heat better and save energy.a clean seal also provides better heat retention.these include self-cleaning models which use less energy for normal cooking because of higher insulation levels.solid disk elements and radiant elements under glass stove tops are easier to clean than conventional electric coil elements, but they take longer to heat up and use more electricity.the best on the market can save as much as 1/3 of the energy used with inferior reflectors.the heating element will stay hot long enough to finish the cooking without using more electricity.
