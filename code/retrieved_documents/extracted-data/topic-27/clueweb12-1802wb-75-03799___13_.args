for someone who is a major fail at time management and planning, this is oftendisastrous to normal meal times.you can also put warm water from the tap into the pot to make it faster, and of course, turn the heat as high as it will go.we rent right now so the stove isn't exactly the best quality because why would the owners invest in a fancy stove for renters.it annoys me that if you have the heat up a little to high you have to wait 10 minutes for the burner to cool down to where you want it.i always boil my water in an electric kettle and then pour it into a pot on the stove top.we are moving to ohio now and gas stove was on my must list for buying a new house.we have a pretty large microwave and now i boil so many things in the microwave because i read an article that said microwaves are more energy efficient.we currently have an electric from the mid 90s and we are getting ready to move to a house with a gas stove.put a little salt in your water, it will help it boil more quickly.i donâ€™t know if it is for sure true for everyone but it is for us because our stove is soooo ancient.i am not having any luck finding it and it sounds so good this time of year.anyhow, our last house in ohio was originally electric stove and my husband (who i should note is not at all mechanically inclined or handy) ran a gas line to it.but if one burner is dead, maybe one day you'll find yourself with an actual need for a new stove.i wanted a gas line and a new stove but that line would have cost $1000 and natural gas out here is like, $100 a month.which makes watching water boil so much more fun.
