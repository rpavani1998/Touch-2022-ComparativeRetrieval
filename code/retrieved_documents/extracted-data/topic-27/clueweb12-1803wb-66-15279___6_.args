in any event, the recipe below is just an approximation, but i’m very certain that it will produce good results and also that you could add a bit more or less of any one ingredient and it should be fine.you won’t be able to taste it in the final product and it kind of gives it a rustic feel.it also happens that the recipe makes enough to feed a small village.this will basically steam the peppers and make them super-easy to peel.the stems and florets work great in this recipe.this will stop the broccoli from cooking.that way they are really fresh and flavorful.if you have an electric stove then you will have to use the oven or a grill if you have one.roasted red peppers, olives, and feta give it kind of a mediterranean feel.roast peppers in the oven (450 degrees for about 30-40 minutes turning every 10 minutes or so) or on top of your gas stove (set the peppers right on the stove top, turn on the heat and using tongs, turn the peppers every few minutes until they are almost black all over for about 10 – 15 minutes).it would be solid for a picnic or just to use as a side dish.its just so easy to get caught up in the cooking and throw in a little of this and that.it’s pretty important to do it in a separate bowl so you can make sure the dressing is mixed well and also so you can taste it and adjust it if you need to.[reply] if stuck with an electric stove, a gas grill will roast all your vegtables to pefection.now i actually prefer the electric range (easier, though slower to control temp., much better to clean/no chance of actually setting self on fire when cooking intoxicated).
