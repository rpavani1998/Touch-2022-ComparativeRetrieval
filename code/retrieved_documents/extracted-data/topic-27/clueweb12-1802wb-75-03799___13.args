it was pretty expensive to run the line, of course you will need a new stove.
but that is how i used to feel about aqua, turquoise, and the like because they reminded me of the ‘80’s, but you do aqua right and jennifer: http://jennifersjunkylife.typepad.com/whimsical_junk/ has helped too.
but i agree, both with the bad stuff from the 80's and how much i don't prefer my electric cooktop.
it randomly will be a billion degrees and then ice cold for no reason.
not good for toffee crack making.
even if it doesn't solve mycooktop issues, i now like it 2575 besides, one of the burners is broken and now has an actual purpose in life.
start on one that is high and then have another that is on a low setting and move the pot midway through.
i don’t know if it is for sure true for everyone but it is for us because our stove is soooo ancient.
but if one burner is dead, maybe one day you'll find yourself with an actual need for a new stove.
you can also put warm water from the tap into the pot to make it faster, and of course, turn the heat as high as it will go.
what kind is it?replydelete only cool kids have aqua pots.
but i must point out that i see your cooktop is a magicchef and my mil currently has a new mc microwave which comes on and runs all by itself even when the door is open...and no one will own up to taking it back or replacing...so she's stuck with unplugging it after every use!!
i always boil my water in an electric kettle and then pour it into a pot on the stove top.
we have a pretty large microwave and now i boil so many things in the microwave because i read an article that said microwaves are more energy efficient.
she's from the 80's too!replydelete i've had to adjust to cooking on electric as well.
so, if you are stuck with electric forever, perhaps a nice electric range would do the trick.
to be the resting place of my new aqua gorgeousness.
sorry about the electric range, i am also a gas girl.
it may be possible to have gas back eventually.
i know that i will especially love it when those ice storms come through and kill our electricity.
it would sit out all the time here in my kitchen too.
i'll bet that pot makes a fabulous pot of chili.
for someone who is a major fail at time management and planning, this is oftendisastrous to normal meal times.
argh!replydelete i totally missed telling you happy birthday.
making peace with an enemy.
we currently have an electric from the mid 90s and we are getting ready to move to a house with a gas stove.
i simply cannot cook on electric.
i can do a large amount of noodles in the microwave and have it done in 12-15 minutes!
we've been in our house six months and i still have not gotten used to it and mess things up all the time on it.
the only good part of that cooktop is the gorgeous pot.
ugh!replydelete oooh my mom has one and i can't stand trying to boil water at her house when i have super gas burners on my stove top.
the smurfs were pretty good.
put a little salt in your water, it will help it boil more quickly.
we are moving to ohio now and gas stove was on my must list for buying a new house.
it annoys me that if you have the heat up a little to high you have to wait 10 minutes for the burner to cool down to where you want it.
i’d like to go back to electric for safety reasons, but i know it will be hard to do, for the reasons you mentioned.
i think it costs about $2575 to put a gas line in.... um, hello - rainbow brite, the care bears, jem and myself are all rad things from the 80's!
yes, i know lots of people with gas that prefer gas, but if you found something newer, you'd be much happier.
i really really really do not prefer electric either.
but i just tear up everytime i see all the good things other people seemed to be able to send and do for project 320.
delete we have had an electric burner situation as well.
but until then the aqua pot will still look great sitting there!!!
this momma loves 'the smiths', loves the aqua pot, loves you, but hates electric for cooking!
and once again, you make me laugh so much my face hurts.
replydelete i am so with you on the electric cook top.
they usually put that brand in apartments.
it could just be the stove.
i am not having any luck finding it and it sounds so good this time of year.
i wanted a gas line and a new stove but that line would have cost $1000 and natural gas out here is like, $100 a month.
if not, you will lose 75% of the energy out of the top of the pot.
that pot is so pretty.
which makes watching water boil so much more fun.
we are moving again (long sad story) and the thing i keep saying to myself to make things seem a little better is, at least i'll have a gas cook top back!
i have had to deal with electric for the past 3 years because having gas appliances is a rarity in fl.
well i would say that aqua pot would make the electric burner "situation" better too...
i was raised around an electric stove, but we have had gas for awhile now.
anyhow, our last house in ohio was originally electric stove and my husband (who i should note is not at all mechanically inclined or handy) ran a gas line to it.
it's known for being a crappy brand.
we rent right now so the stove isn't exactly the best quality because why would the owners invest in a fancy stove for renters.
i think your pot is pretty.
anyway, if you can, get rid of that magic chef asap.
looks like the perfect pot for making the pioneer woman's cinnamon rolls...
thanks and by the way, the blue pot is awesome!!!!replydelete i love sunshine, happy people, and the power to delete.
reply delete that awesomely colored pot would make having to live with that cooktop worth it...
love your aqua pot though.
