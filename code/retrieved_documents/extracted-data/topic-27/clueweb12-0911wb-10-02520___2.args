this is a lesson that i wishradio designers would learn.
kai willadsen march 21st, 2007 5:02 pm coming very late to the party, but my (unfortunately ex-) microwave is too good not to mention, with a combination of discrete and analogue control on a single, quasi-modal knob, and a digital display.
so not intuitive…maybe they’d see improvement is needed.
if rethinking an interface as simple as your stove can make your life better, imagine what rethinking the fundamental interface tools of computers can do.
staring at a red coil tells you much less about the cooking temperature than does a quick glance at the size of the flame: the red only tells you that the stove is hot, nothow hot.
thoutz may 22nd, 2006 12:28 am hmmm, sounds nice but you are doubling the vertical size… that means increase manufactoring cost.
if only the stove designer’s had thought to put a little detent at the minimum gas flow position, then i could feel instantly–without looking–exactly where simmer is.
because i never quite know where the lowest setting is, i invariably turn the burner off at least three times before getting it right.
friday redesigning stoves redesign ui design fundamentals the kitchen is a great place to go bad interface diving.
it’s confusing to set and when the microwave starts, there is no way to tell what the power setting is.
this leads to a general rule: interfaces should always give indication that lets the user know exactly what they’ve just done: turning the knob makes the flame grow.
if you pick one way, someone else will pick another.

my family’s sharp microwave could benefit from knobs - one for the timer and one for the power setting.

the controls themselves need to match the same pattern.
because of this, you’re forced to stand with your hand over the stove, just to know that turning the knob actually did something .
as far as the heating temperature, the feedback issues, and ‘close to off’ positioning, i am in full agreement.
it’s good to find a techno-savy youngster who can see the world from a non-technical perspective.
you just cannot map four object arranged in a square in a unique way to four objects arranged in a line.
see this picture of full heat controller: http://sphere.pl/~tomkh/amica.png (you can see a big and a small flame icon).
the “quick minute” button on microwaves forces the user to make a choice, andfewer choices mean fewer worries.
ex libris has a knob microwave similar to the sanyo one atul linked to, and it is awesome, and nicer than mine.
since these fundamental settings are all located right on the horizontal and vertical axes of each knob, it’s easy to see at a glance how each burner is set, even if there are big pots blocking your view of the actual flame, and you can do it without bending over to see and decipher text or icons.
in order to change seconds, you pushed (and held) in the knob and turned it.
chandler june 4th, 2006 12:38 pm how about a trapezoidal layout on the cooktop and a flattened trapezoidal control layout.
showing the heat there are two main stove varieties: gas and electric.
cooks generally agree that gas is preferable.
turning the knob changed minutes in one-minute increments, and you could feel the knob click at each increment.
but since owning it, i’ve realized how much easier and simpler it is to use, and i find it annoying to have to use the button microwaves at uncle joe’s and cobb coffee shop.
our new (well, new to us) range solves the problem like richard’s, with knobs that go off–light/high–med–low, so finding the minimum flame setting is just a matter of turning the knob as far as it will go.
with stoves i’m accustomed to the convention of having the back burner knobs toward the center, but i have been frustrated by the impossibility of finding the lowest possible simmer on some units.
i’ll go out on a very thick limb and guess it has the bad co-linear knob configuration.
this was awesome because it is incredibly rare that i put something in the microwave for 2 minutes and 15 seconds — it’s usually 4, 8, 10 — so the discrete minutes worked.
a search on amazon.com yieldedthis sanyo microwave, which features a “60-minute digital rotary timer”… it seems to be getting decent user reviews, too.
because with the gas stove, the size of the flame gives immediate feedback: the larger the flame, the more quickly the food will cook.
and the analogue seconds were fantastic, because you quickly established a reflex action to push in the knob and twist it a little to (for example) reheat coffee for “a little bit”.
i don’t know how much time i’ve wasted–uncomfortably doubled over with my eye at flame level–trying to coax the stove to burn at the lowest possible temperature.
in this quasi-mode, the seconds increased in an analogue fashion… no clicking.
the general interface rule we can derive is thus: controls should retain the spatial or conceptual relationship of the things they control.

instead, a good knob layout should mirror the burner layout: simple.
aza raskin march 21st, 2007 5:06 pm that’s a great interface, kai.
cooks generally agree that gas is preferable.
there aren’t many - i guess the compulsion to get immersed in technology is just too great for most: i like particularly the appreciation of the subtle benefits of manual systems which are so often overlooked.
itlooks like this but older and less snazzy.
kate november 2nd, 2007 7:02 pm i actually prefer the knobs to be either on or above the cooktop, because then my kids can’t reach them.
you’d think that it would be standard–a simple change effortlessly removes the everyday mistakes of stove use: i’d never again burn the kitchen mitt i always leave on the front burner.

yeah, the people at viking should actually have to use their own stove tops at home.
the ex-libris microwave has a bunch of text that may be such suggestions, but i’ve definitely never bothered to read it.
the display then reads “p - ” and then the user must press one of the numbers.
mike april 13th, 2006 10:27 am i’d have to say the best microwaves in theory are the ones with knobs.
also more advanced models has push-pull lighted knobs (i imagine if it is pulled it is not turning off when lowered to max).
the best microwaves are the ones with knobs: as long as they’re properly marked, you can use the same simple, quick mechanism to heat your food for 1 minute, 40 seconds, or however long you want.
given that tactile feedback, i might even be able to pull off rice pudding while cooking an egg.
aza june 5th, 2006 11:08 am chandler, a trapezoidal layout is clever, simple, and effective.
because i never quite know where the lowest setting is, i invariably turn the burner off at least three times before getting it right.
i've wasted--uncomfortably doubled over with my eye at flame level--trying to coax the stove to burn at the lowest possible temperature.
the coils of an electric stone do turn red–after a long wait–but it’s hard to gauge the relative temperature from the color.
i’ll go out on a very thick limb and guess it has the bad co-linear knob configuration.
i’ve never actually come across a knob-contolled microwaves that didn’t have some give in the mechanism that limited my control of the microwave time to a range of plus or minus 30 seconds.
it is confusing, because one must first input with buttons, the time, then press the power setting.
if you pick one way, someone else will pick another.
help me simmer stove designers cleverly used the same knob that controls the temperature of the stove to also control whether the burner is on or off.
one tactile knob for a digital timer and one knob for a digital power setting would be great for this long running and reliable microwave.

it may sound kind of nitpicky here, but every little extra choice the user needs to make can add up to one confusing interface.
in interface terms, an electric stove doesn’t give a good indication of its temperature.
doubtful, but i can keep dreaming.
am that’s true, mike, although i believe that knob microwaves with digital readouts do exist.
i think it’s the most useful button, but then you get problems when you don’t want your food to explode after just 40 seconds… about the stoves, you said “a simple change effortlessly removes the everyday mistakes of stove use”… but i wouldn’t call it effortless… the control panel on the stove design you suggested would have to be twice as tall as a normal, and would look sort of funny being so oblong with the two stacked dials.
a old-style volume control provides an instant volume change facility, instant volume recognition facility, ability to adjust quickly or slowly etc.
one could even have a matching of size (larger controls for larger burners and small for small).
this is a lesson that i wishradio designers would learn.

pm on my stove (http://www.amica.com.pl/) there is a simply mapping of the heat controller… [off…min…max…min] so setting the heat to the minimum level is very simple (as well as maximum and turning off) and you can’t make mistake here.
but they added a detente too (necessary at an off->high boundary), which probably would have sufficed.
because of this, you’re forced to stand with your hand over the stove, just to know that turning the knob actually did something .
this is something that can’t be remedied by a digital readout.
yes, knobs controlling both temperature, on/off, and with digital-like settings that have both tactile feedback and that little click sound are the way to design for both electric and gas ovens.
staring at a red coil tells you much less about the cooking temperature than does a quick glance at the size of the flame: the red only tells you that the stove is hot, nothow hot.
it has pretty good timing precision.
such an obvious thing, in my opinion, but lost on product designers.
i always found it startling that just turning the burner on resulted in a huge flame, but it makes sense from the “give me simmer” point of view.

unfortunately, this knob design this means that “off” and “simmer” are only separated by a few degrees.
it’s rare to find two microwaves that take the same amount of time to heat the same amount of food to the same temperature.

my microwave has a knob… unfortunately, that’s not because i was being mindful of its usability or anything, but just because it was $5 on ebay (plus $20 shipping…).
then i can focus my energy on something less difficult.
the back of each knob is round, but the flattish area you actually grip is thinner at one end, so it acts as a big, obvious arrow.
