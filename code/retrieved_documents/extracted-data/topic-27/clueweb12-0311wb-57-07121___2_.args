it does perform as advertised, but you do need to take care since making coffee with this drip coffeemaker is a little different than using an electric brewer.you have to regulate the heat and i found using less than medium heat on the gas stove was better - just brews best on the lower heat.this coffeemaker is definitely unique - there are no other gas-stove drip models around, so there's nothing else to really compare it to.overall impression i like the brewed coffee it makes and being able to have drip coffee while camping or when there's no electricity available - that's very nice.and there's really no way to keep the coffee warm, except for a few minutes on low, or pouring the coffee into a thermal carafe after it finishes brewing.and it does give the coffee lover a drip brewer that works well for camping.related resources compare prices of coffeemakers compare prices of coleman products coffeemaker buying tips read more coffeemaker reviews read more about coffeemakers how to clean a coffeemaker with vinegar small appliances - buying tips, resources, reviews go to home page user reviews write a review be the first to write a review more about coffeemakers - coffee makers - coffee maker buying tips - types of coffee makers - benefits of each type of coffee maker - coffee filters - does filter shape affect coffee flavor?- toasters coleman camping drip camping coffeemaker photo courtesy of pricegrabber i have always been curious about how this camp stove drip coffeemaker would work, so i borrowed one from a friend just to try it out - to see if i should buy one for my next camping trip.the base fits better on the smallest stove element and to reduce the risk of melting any plastic on this brewer, i wouldn't use the other burners while the brewer is sitting on the camp stove.but it takes about 20 minutes to brew a pot, not bad really, considering that without it - the alternative is a regular (non-drip) camping pot.product description coleman camping drip coffeemaker model 2000003603 - made for use on a 2 or 3 burner gas camp stove - drip operation - swing out filter basket - uses standard basket style filters - solid steel base - dripless pouring - pause-and-serve feature - msrp $49.99 - for more detail see manufacturer how the coleman drip coffeemaker performed june 4, 2010 it looks similar to a regular drip coffeemaker and has some of my must-have features, like drip brewing, a non-dripping carafe and you can pause it to serve.the carafe also pours well and the whole coffeemaker looks nice.for more detail see manufacturer how the coleman drip coffeemaker performed june 4, 2010 it looks similar to a regular drip coffeemaker and has some of my must-have features, like drip brewing, a non-dripping carafe and you can pause it to serve.as for coffee - it tastes good - like it was brewed at home with a regular drip model.better to remove the pot when the coffee has finished brewing.
