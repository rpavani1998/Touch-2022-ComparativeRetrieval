for most home cooks preparing meals for two to four people, most stovetops provide sufficient heat for successful stir-frying.of course, maintaining a high degree of heat is essential in stir-frying, so knowing how to adapt the wok to your stovetop is a key to success in its usage.many of the newer gas stovetops provide at least one burner with this heat capability.besides stir-frying, a wok is an excellent and very safe utensil for deep-frying.wire rings with open sides work best for powerful gas burners (10,000 b.t.u.'s or hotter), allowing air circulation to nurture the flames.the latter type is especially important if you have an electric stove as it helps concentrate and direct heat.a large skillet is inefficient for stir-frying small amounts and is more likely to burn food should you try to do so.a standard 14-inch wok can easily fry a one to one-and-a-half pound size fish, browning it evenly from head to tail when tilted from side to side during cooking.i am sure there are large numbers of people who feel the same way as i do, among them the growing population of asian americans and countless creative cooks, cooking instructors and cookbook authors of all ethnicity who have enthusiastically adopted the wok into their kitchens.a flat nonstick skillet, as recommended by the magazine, cannot come close to matching the degree of proficiency and pleasure the wok provides in stir-frying, not to mention the flavor enhancement a well-seasoned wok is capable of imparting.it provides a wide area to work with and makes it easy to scoop up crisped food quickly with a large wire-mesh strainer-spatula.the wok continues to be an important and useful utensil and instead of throwing it out, the cultures of asia have adapted it to their new stovetops.of course, to stir-fry large quantities of food at once, it helps to have a gas range with burners that have an output of at least 10,000 b.t.u.'s.for my students who love to entertain and do not yet own a wok, i advise them to acquire the next larger size - a 16-inch wok, which can fry fishes large enough to feed six to eight with ease.you may also avoid the risk of burning in overheated oil the garlic and onions, which should be added early on to flavor the oil, and in turn for the oil to flavor the meats, seafoods or vegetables to be stir-fried in it.
