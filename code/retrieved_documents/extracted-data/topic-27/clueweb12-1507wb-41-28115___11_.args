these components are more expensive than ordinary chimney lining work and the location of the stove needs to be thought about carefully in order to ensure the chimney is able to function well.as long as we are confident that the stove complies with british regulations and is compatible with our flue components we are normally happy to organise its installation within our local area.it is important to buy the right sized stove (a large stove in a small room always ends up being turned down low and creates much more creosote) and burning the right kind of fuel at the right temperature (smokeless fuel or dry hard wood burned hot is best).most people choose to buy a stove because they know they will get much more heat from much less fuel than with their open fire.if a fitting component has been sourced and provided by us then we are confident of its quality and have direct channels of communication with the manufacturer.it’s flammable and it causes chimney fires.it is important to buy the right sized stove (a large stove in a small room always ends up being turned down low and creates much more creosote) and burning the right kind of fuel at the right temperature (smokeless fuel or dry hard woodover time this can cause smells, fires and other serious problems.the benefits of a metal liner are that it keeps the flue gases warm and moving quickly at a fixed (small) diameteryou can get this certificate in one of two ways – if a hetas registered engineer installs the stove they will issue one themselves; if a non-registered person installs it (for example you or your builder) then it must be done through your local council and a building inspector will need to inspect the installation and issue the certification.in the unlikely event of any problems arising with it we are able to examine similar items and installations and pursue claims through the correct channels.creosote is acidic and over time it eats through brick and stone work causing leaky chimneys.customers purchasing both the stove and the fitting components from us will of course be given priority especially during the busy season.it will provide information of the installer, the materials used and the date of the installation so that a person working on the stove or chimney later has access to all the details they need.creosote is the black tar-like substance you sometimes find in chimneys – open fires can cause it, fire-boxes often do, but stoves are the real culprit!
