its a simple, in-line valve, and depending on where it is installed, you could easily turn off gas to the whole stove when not in use.most homes that have a gas line to the kitchen will have a valve to cut the line right before it hits the stove.lots of room on top to put things while you were cooking, and it had an oven you could turn off half way through and it retained the heat.a decent commercial burner will produce 26 - 36 thousand btusmost building codes reguire safty devices on all gas appliances, requiring the modifacation for your stove, to be sold or used.it is more dangerous to not have a pilot, if you bump a handel and turn on the gas even slightly, you have a very bad situation.the oven doesn't have a pilot light so it has to be lit by hand.at any rate...if you have someone come in to fix the stove, make sure you ask ahead of time if they can repair vintage stoves.this makes lighting the stove a three step process (1.most residential gas cook tops cwill not produce more than 16 to 20 thousand btus that is entirely too little heat.unfortunately, the oven pilot light kept going out, and the idiot who came to fix it ended up irreparably breaking it...banged things with a hammer that shouldn't have been banged, and broke a piece off.it likely wouldn't be used every day, and we'd be either doing the connection ourselves, or hiring a plumber, so we could put an in-line valve in if we want to.i did find one antique gas stove refurbisher who said that it's illegal in the state of california to modify this sort of thing.i've searched on the internet, but haven't exactly been able to figure out what to use in the search.i do have two small boys (almost 6 and 4 yrs old), so the point about the knobs being bumped and turning on the gas is a concern.
