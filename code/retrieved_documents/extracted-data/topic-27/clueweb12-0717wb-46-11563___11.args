i do have two small boys (almost 6 and 4 yrs old), so the point about the knobs being bumped and turning on the gas is a concern.
some apartment owner was remodeling, i guess.
at any rate...if you have someone come in to fix the stove, make sure you ask ahead of time if they can repair vintage stoves.
removing the knobs would make them kid proof join to post - recent topics in "diy - do it yourself" topic author replies last post diy 12 cylinder engine cliff 11 march 2, 2012
the oven doesn't have a pilot light so it has to be lit by hand.
white enamel, four burners with a big empty (enameled) spot on top for setting pans and spoon rests, and the bottom part was sorta divided in half -- two big doors with the oven on the right, and two drawers below -- again the broiler on the right.
most homes that have a gas line to the kitchen will have a valve to cut the line right before it hits the stove.
the electronic ignition was touchy...wouldn't work if you got the littlest bit of grease on the burner.
unfortunately, after an extensive local and internet search, i couldn't find the replacement part.

i did find one antique gas stove refurbisher who said that it's illegal in the state of california to modify this sort of thing.
lots of room on top to put things while you were cooking, and it had an oven you could turn off half way through and it retained the heat.
it likely wouldn't be used every day, and we'd be either doing the connection ourselves, or hiring a plumber, so we could put an in-line valve in if we want to.

the old stoves were mmanufactured with fewer or no regulations.
most building codes reguire safty devices on all gas appliances, requiring the modifacation for your stove, to be sold or used.
any idea of the year and manufacturer? join to post - - cliff 79 re: old gas stove fri, october 6, 2006 - 7:21 am those older gas stoves are usually way better than the new ones.
had to get used to the hotter burners again, but i wouldn't trade it for the world.
but if you can hang with that, its unlikely your boys will ever turn on the gas by mistake.
if i remember right, you can cap off the pilots to the top burners, but depending on the state you live in it may not be legal.
i don't remember what brand the stove was -- it definitely wasn't a major brand.
its a simple, in-line valve, and depending on where it is installed, you could easily turn off gas to the whole stove when not in use.

most residential gas cook tops cwill not produce more than 16 to 20 thousand btus that is entirely too little heat.
reason: new ones have to comply with the newer code regs for consumer stoves.

i ended up buying a new ge stove which i had for a few years and hated it.
however, there's a sticker on it that says that it has no pilot.
unfortunately, the oven pilot light kept going out, and the idiot who came to fix it ended up irreparably breaking it...banged things with a hammer that shouldn't have been banged, and broke a piece off.

highly unlikely you could turn them on by accident.
badly insulated oven...compared with the old maytag.
didn't get hot enough.
unfortunately, after an extensive local and internet search, i couldn't find the replacement part.
no room on the top of the stove to put anything.
as i said, i think this is pretty much code for any gas line in most states.

i've searched on the internet, but haven't exactly been able to figure out what to use in the search.

all told it adds up to $$$$ some of the old stoves are worth it though.

the idiot that broke my maytag wanted to charge me for the service call.
in other words, we wouldn't be stuck with whatever is there.
the oven doesn't have a pilot light so it has to be lit by hand.
anyway, one of the ones they were throwing out is in terrific shape -- only a couple of chips.
they cook your food gaster at higher tempratures.

it is more dangerous to not have a pilot, if you bump a handel and turn on the gas even slightly, you have a very bad situation.
i can't believe i didn't even think that gas lines would have the same kind of mechanism as water plumbing!

a decent commercial burner will produce 26 - 36 thousand btus
the older stoves are the shizzille.
but if you can hang with that, its unlikely your boys will ever turn on the gas by mistake.
but you can also buy handheld piezo lighters for a buck.
if you have kids, i would never risk it, being the little handle bumpers that they are !
the burners do have a pilot.
most homes that have a gas line to the kitchen will have a valve to cut the line right before it hits the stove.

apparantly the idiot lawmakers think we can't have a reasonably hot burner so they have down grades the btu speccs for stoves.
