one tactile knob for a digital timer and one knob for a digital power setting would be great for this long running and reliable microwave.because with the gas stove, the size of the flame gives immediate feedback: the larger the flame, the more quickly the food will cook.a old-style volume control provides an instant volume change facility, instant volume recognition facility, ability to adjust quickly or slowly etc.it’s rare to find two microwaves that take the same amount of time to heat the same amount of food to the same temperature.in interface terms, an electric stove doesn’t give a good indication of its temperature.the best microwaves are the ones with knobs: as long as they’re properly marked, you can use the same simple, quick mechanism to heat your food for 1 minute, 40 seconds, or however long you want.since these fundamental settings are all located right on the horizontal and vertical axes of each knob, it’s easy to see at a glance how each burner is set, even if there are big pots blocking your view of the actual flame, and you can do it without bending over to see and decipher text or icons.if rethinking an interface as simple as your stove can make your life better, imagine what rethinking the fundamental interface tools of computers can do.yes, knobs controlling both temperature, on/off, and with digital-like settings that have both tactile feedback and that little click sound are the way to design for both electric and gas ovens.with stoves i’m accustomed to the convention of having the back burner knobs toward the center, but i have been frustrated by the impossibility of finding the lowest possible simmer on some units.this leads to a general rule: interfaces should always give indication that lets the user know exactly what they’ve just done: turning the knob makes the flame grow.i think it’s the most useful button, but then you get problems when you don’t want your food to explode after just 40 seconds… about the stoves, you said “a simple change effortlessly removes the everyday mistakes of stove use”… but i wouldn’t call it effortless… the control panel on the stove design you suggested would have to be twice as tall as a normal, and would look sort of funny being so oblong with the two stacked dials.you’d think that it would be standard–a simple change effortlessly removes the everyday mistakes of stove use: i’d never again burn the kitchen mitt i always leave on the front burner.my family’s sharp microwave could benefit from knobs - one for the timer and one for the power setting.our new (well, new to us) range solves the problem like richard’s, with knobs that go off–light/high–med–low, so finding the minimum flame setting is just a matter of turning the knob as far as it will go.
