with an electric stove, the main environmental issue may be emissions of greenhouse gases and other harmful air pollutants associated with coal-fired electricity generation.burning natural gas also produces air pollution, but in smaller quantities than coal.regarding electric vs. natural gas stoves, there appear to be at least two main environmental issues associated with energy type that merit consideration: air quality and habitat destruction.if you continue to apply that same scrutiny to all your consumer choices, i believe in the long run you’ll make the best decisions for the environment.when natural gas fields are developed, they can destroy natural habitat and harm ecosystems.however, i also believe that supporting renewable energy sources is important for our long term security, public health, and overall environmental well-being.however, if a new stove purchase is inevitable, then purchasing the most energy efficient one you can afford would be optimal.you can avoid those emissions by purchasingrenewable power from your utility, if available.if either of these options is a possibility, then perhaps the issue is moot because the stove will remain electric.if it were me, i would try and fix the existing stove and purchase renewable energy.i’m with you; i prefer the cooking quality that gas stoves provide.that way you’re using the least amount of energy you can whether it’s electricity ornatural gas.for natural gas stoves, the main environmental impact associated with the extraction and transmission of natural gas.the fact that you’re considering the environmental impact of your choices is a great step in the right direction.there are some interesting induction and solar-hybrid options that available if you are feeling adventuresome.
