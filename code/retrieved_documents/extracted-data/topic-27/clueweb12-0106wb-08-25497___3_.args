modern water heaters are generally very well insulated, and adding additional insulation will only save a small amount of energy.a tankless water heater can provide unlimited hot water as long as it is operating within its capacity.using electricity, gas, or propane as a heat source, tankless water heaters, in some cases, can cut your water-heating bill by 10 to 20 percent.however, new gas water heaters boast more efficient combustion than older ones, meaning that less heat escapes up the flue, and less gas is needed to heat the water.these provide hot water right where you need it, when you need it, without a storage tank.typically, a homeowner relying on electricity to heat water could save up to $500 in the first year of operation by installing a solar water heating system.by providing warm water immediately where it's used, tankless water heaters waste less water.electric tankless water heaters require a relatively high electric power draw because water must be heated quickly to the desired temperature.a tankless water heater can supplement a regular water heater in a distant location, or it can be used for all your hot water needs.a new showerhead can save as much as $10 a year in water and energy.therefore, they can be two to three times more energy efficient than conventional electric resistance water heaters.here are some drawbacks to on-demand water heating: tankless water heaters usually cannot supply enough hot water for simultaneous uses such as showers and laundry.wrapping exposed hot water pipes with insulation will minimize heat loss.electric units will draw more instantaneous power than tank-type water heaters.it usually costs three times as much to heat the same amount of water with electricity as it does with gas.
