multi-fuel stoves sound best, but i know little about them.the stove itself adds the vintage touch - and in that case, the rusty old metal will look great, rather than shabby.i have some interest in wood burning stoves, or something more versatile / efficient / environmentally friendly.a fireplace might work better in a different location, instead of fitting one here in the corner.if it's not modern looking, it should look quaint in an old-fashioned way.or add a coat of paint to the stove to bring it up-to-date a bit.seems smart to save money over electric heaters.i suggest not getting rid of it, but designing around it so that its surroundings are more modern.it has this corner brick and old natural gas heater/stove, that i need ideas for.also, if i remove the stove, i would put drywall instead of the paneling.the paneling is only in the corner behind the stove.if i put a fireplace or stove, perhaps i can still have drywall there.i'm renovating a room that will be a main room.heater.jpg the stove vents to the chimney already, so are there fireplaces which are easy to attach up the same way?the carpet is being replaced with wood laminate.
