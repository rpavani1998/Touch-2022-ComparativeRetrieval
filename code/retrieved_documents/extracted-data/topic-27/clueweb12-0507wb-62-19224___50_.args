good quality appliances add a huge amount to the resale value of a kitchen, plus they last longer and actually work well while you are using them.the stovetop heats and allows a wide range of cooking, the oven heats evenly throughout.i’m no real estate expert, but a consistent message i hear from the real estate agents i’ve spoken with and from almost every hgtv show i’ve watched, are that kitchens with modern appliances help sell a home.our goal is to keep expenses down as much as possible so that we don’t feel owned by our mortgage payment.yes, the wall oven cost more compared to a standard stove, but the microwave doesn’t take up counter space, of which we have precious little, and all the pots and pans are right under the stove, and my partner and i have a less frustrating time cooking together, and subsequently we eat at home much more often than we did before.bittman writes: [chefs and food writers] know that when it comes to kitchens, size and equipment don’t count nearly as much as devotion, passion, common sense and, of course, experience.while it might seem that ‘buy a stove’ is the goal, it’s really more ‘make our kithen an efficient, non-frustrating and enjoyable workspace for us to work in at the same time, on a budget of $##,000, so that we can eat healthy at home and have fun cooking together’.the new kitchen, which is nice but not top-of-the-line, gives us significantly more space (both cupboard and countertop), and is a joy to work in.it is a zero-clearance fireplace that is more like a furnace, so it also saves us heating costs….but ultimately, we figured it would add more value to the home than it cost.keeping in mind the problems you are trying to solve is a great way to make the right decisions when remodeling, and i imagine it could be applied to building new, too.a flow chart can be helpful (at the very least as a demonstration method for making logical decisions), as long as you fully define the goal and know what the constraints really are.if cooking is an important hobby there’s nothing wrong with making a purchase to upgrade for a more ejoyable experience as long as it does not compromise other more important fiancial goals.the gas burners were constantly in need of adjustment and put out too much heat, even on the lowest setting.we don’t need top-of-the-line appliances to do what we love.good windows, insulation, heating systems…they can all have big payoff in money and comfort
