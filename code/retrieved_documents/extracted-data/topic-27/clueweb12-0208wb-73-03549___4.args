we had electric and were thinking of going to natural gas because we like to cook on that better, but then i thought...hydrocarbon, pipelines...etc.
however, if a new stove purchase is inevitable, then purchasing the most energy efficient one you can afford would be optimal.
i’m with you; i prefer the cooking quality that gas stoves provide.
regarding electric vs. natural gas stoves, there appear to be at least two main environmental issues associated with energy type that merit consideration: air quality and habitat destruction.
