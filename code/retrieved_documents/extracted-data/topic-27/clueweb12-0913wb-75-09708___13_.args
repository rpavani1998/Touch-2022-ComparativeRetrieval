if the stove top kettle lasts for 40 years and is still functional, you ought to compare that to the monetary and environmental costs of making and buying 5-8 electric kettles in that time period.in my experience, electric kettles come with guaranteed obsolescence.i was useful for reheating leftovers, but now i use the oven efficiently: putting a few things in at a time or just heat stuff quickly in a pan.we are living abroad for a temporary period of time so we didn't want to put a lot of money into appliances we wouldn't be taking back with us.or at the very least a rocket stove such as yours, in case of power outages.our electric kettle started to fail about a year ago, leaking around the base.there's no line loss of electricity between your home and the point of generation when using gas, though gas certainly has its issues as well.and yes, i've heard that boiling with a gas cooktop (which is what we have) is more efficient than boiling with an electric kettle anyway.planned obsolescence has to be the most destructive part of the current company/product/profits system.having said that, we only use the microwave for re-heating leftovers, melting butter for baking and heating milk for our daily coffee, plus it takes up a lot of bench space...it takes up so much bench space for... me to reheat food once or twice a week (could do that on the stove), and cook vegetables once or twice a week, or less because i like them better steamed.we have been without a microwave since we moved to a new house 6 months ago.kind regards belinda hi julie, you will be fine without a microwave, we have never owned one though my mum lent us hers when our stove was out of action and to be honest i could figure how to make it part of my meal preparation routine.the doomers among us could argue that the electric kettle will be useless after the crash, while the stove top kettle will eventually be used on a wood stove.hi paula, yes, it is normally more efficient to use an electric kettle, but we have a gas stovetop which works out about the same because it's more efficient (it doesn't have to heat up the element first)...
