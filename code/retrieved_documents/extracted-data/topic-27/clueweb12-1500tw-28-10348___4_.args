if something is designed to withstand the abuse it will get in a restaurant kitchen, then chances are it will last almost forever in a household kitchen.it’s a personal preference and while many say that gas is better (and i do love it) you can make a fine meal on an electric stove too.there are so many great places, so the best way to find out if there’s a restaurant that stands out is to look on the reviews page.i find the quality of the products there to be really good.you can make a fine meal on an electric stove too.they focus on the human struggle and the competition as well as the drama.i’d say my favorites include some traditional french (because that’s what i learned), classic american as well as barbecue, italian, spanish, mexican, seafood, sushi and japanese, thai and contemporary canadian.i was taught by one of my chefs to “make it taste like the sea”.mainly because i find that those shows are produced for entertainment purposes rather than showcasing the food itself.if you have something you want to know and you think the ol’ foodfella could help, send it along and maybe it will be on this page.there are tons of great food blogs out there – many of which that are far better than mine.but that being said, if you’re making a dish that has a lot of salt in it (pasta with prosciutto or pancetta, for example) then i ease up on the salt in the pasta water.i can’t think of anything worse than a subway car full of people who have to smell whatever it is some guy (or girl) brought on board with them.there is no such thing because nobody should be eating on a bus, streetcar or subway.i’ve gotten a lot of questions about food as well as everything else over the years, so i did what anyone else with tons of time on his hands would do: i started an faq page.
