your right it's probably not going to be the best in the wind (there is a plan for homemade wind breaker on the page) and won't have the btu of the much bigger stoves.
if i like backpacker, i'll pay just $12.00 and receive a offer valid in us only.
inventors note; the g-micro psl is not intended to replace the present crop of turbocharged pressurized gas stoves when used under normal circumstances.
the clip on the web page shows the guy lighting a stream of gas it looks pretty neat when it lights off.
blows every other stove away especially if it's used with the dyi wind breaker on our tips n tricks page.
i hate liquid fuel its a pain so one time i tried a pressurized iso butane stove and it hardly worked on the ice so never again.
i will probably order one and give it whirl as if i don't have enough stoves already.
i'm a low environmental impact guy so no stinky spilled fuel or canisters sounds good me.

however, for the uncompromising minimalist who wants to toss a g-micro and fuel in his / her pocket and is content with waiting a few more minutes for 2 cups of water to boil then later use it for illumination / lantern there is no equal.
this is only possible because, unlike any other small stove, the wax fuel is hardened and will not spill or flair up.
offer valid in us only.
good thing it was not lit or i might have a different story to tell.
just be careful it gets very hot.
anyway i did get a reply from the wax stove company inventor, which is cool and here it is below.
they are excellent stoves having a much higher btu mostly due to their much larger physical size.
my whisperlite cracked but i did tighten the valve nut too much (first time servicing it in 15 years), slight ooze but no spray.
if its windy i have lit the capillary wick under my parka before exposing to wind.
yes the wggs produces volumes of highly volatile combustible gas from solid wax.
it was sooty n not very easy to light in the wind.
as mentioned, i also made a tuna can with cardboard rolled up n waxed

posted on: dec. 26 2011, 10:37 pm it looks kinda cheesie, more like a candle than a stove.
find another thread to post will ya please some of us just want chat.
yes you will get some soot on the pot but this is normal for any high molecular weight fuel.
like any stove device a wind screen is a good tool to have outside if there is wind.
dear brad, thank you for the inquiry, i will reply to your questions personally.
the web page say's its a lantern also almost looks and sounds too good to be true but who knows.
powerful: our 1350 f. wax gas flame is adjustable from 3 to 8 inches.
unusual the pump of the dragongly cracked.
you'd do better with a whisperlite or any preasurised liquid fuel stove for winter use.
as a matter of fact, because of the g-micro psl's small size, one of our greatest engineering challenges was to throttle back gas production enough to produce a clean soot free flame.
i also doubt you'll get that thing going in the wind.
for an explorer like todd carmichael  www.subzerosolo.com  (check out his photo page) who carries two g-micro psl's in his kit it's an enabler.
but, having said that once warmed up to full operating temperature the g-micro will take a surprisingly stiff cross wind especially if a pot is on top.
all you need to do is cut a strip of couragated carboard the height of the can, roll it up till it fills the can.
posted on: dec. 26 2011, 8:22 pm i used what they called a paraffin stove in europe but it burned liquid kerosene.
but that was a toy n never really worked very well.
to answer your question the g-micro psl is not a candle and is different in many ways the most obvious is it that it does not have a consumable wick like a wax candle and it has a metallic burner element (watch our video) that burns paraffin wax gas.
however,  if the flame height is adjusted correctly the mostly white / blue flame will not deposit soot.
great feature to have and only available on the psl.
then comes the hard work of teaching people that wax can be much more then a candle and is a very potent high density, safe alternative fuel source.

now drip hot wax over the top till it won't eat anymore.
wax is inert, nontoxic, and lightweight yet as powerful as kerosene!
or just someone who wants the security of having a fire making device that can be fueled with candle wax chips in calamity, disaster or vehicle break down it's a life saver.
if i like it and decide to continue, i'll pay just $12.00, and receive a full one-year subscription (9 issues in all), a73% savings off the newsstand price!
but it looks real small with solid wax for fuel and a lantern light too at under 4
when fitted with a glass lantern globe and the flame is not covered with a pot there is absolutely zero soot.
oh the channels of the couragation are up n down in the can.
