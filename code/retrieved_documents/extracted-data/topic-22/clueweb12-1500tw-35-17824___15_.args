coca-cola maintains strict uniformity in processes in all of its worldwide bottling facilities, but it concedes that exposure to light and how long the product sits on store shelves may affect the taste.whilst glass bottled coke does taste best, in the uk it's not readily available and when it is it's sold at a premium.the fda regulates this kind of potential chemical contact, but even minute, allowable amounts could alter flavor.coca-cola executives may inadvertently help launch a wave of negative publicity by making ludicrous statements like: “the great taste of coca-cola is the same regardless of the package it comes in.”quintus: plastic bottles are permeable to gasses and as a result- the carbonation in a plastic bottle deteriorates over time.coke in a glass bottle tastes different for a very plain and simple reason: bottled coke is usually made in mexico (look at the label, you'll see) and down there they use real cane sugar in the recipe, then bottle it in glass.sure, most people would agree that the cola is indeed delicious and refreshing, and pouring it into a glass or serving it over ice could influence the sensation of its flavor.coca cola made with cane sugar is bottled in small quantities for the jewish holidays.your best bet for getting coke’s pure, unaltered taste is to drink it from a glass bottle, the most inert material it’s served in.for example, the polymer that lines aluminum cans might absorb small amounts of soluble flavor from the soda.according to my totally unscientific research, coke from a glass bottle tastes definitely different from coke served from an aluminium can or a plastic bottle.for most of us, it doesn't seem to be a show stopper, but most beverages tend to cost a bit more in glass bottles.my personal theory is that in a plastic bottle, the coke never reaches quite the same coldness as it does in a can, and therefore never tastes as good.the coke that comes in a glass bottle, is often a bit sweeter and maybe a bit less bubbly than the one in a can.it has started very recently but yet has gained the immense responses from its users, mainly due to its user friendly attitude.
