he not only found that most tastersdon't prefer the sugar version, but thatthinking something was a mexican coke (or the experience of drinking it out of the bottle) had a huge impact.it did illustrate once again, though, thatthere are discernible differences between the colas, and between sugar-sweetened ones and standard american versions.what seems to me more relevant was that,in an exhaustive food lab, kenji tested "mexican coke" (made with sugar) against normal american coke (corn syrup).carey: with a sample size of one, this isn't intended to "prove" that any one of these sodas is superior to another.but as more and more companies are introducing non-hfcs products, it's no surprise to see soda companies jump on the marketing bandwagon, introducing products likepepsi throwback, sweetened with good ol' sugar.a few years ago,adam kuban tasted very little difference between pepsi throwback and the usual kind (and found a very slight office preference for throwback in a double-blind taste test).what surprised me is that i actually preferred corn syrup pepsi to sugar-sweetened coke.i consistently preferred pepsi to coke (which didn't surprise me), and sugar-sweetened soda to corn-syrup soda.we reserve the right to delete off-topic or inflammatory comments.but after this taste test, i'm sticking to sugar when i can.if you see something not so nice, please, report an inappropriate comment.if he doesn't really prefer it, that's a pretty big waste of time and money.carey: john is loyal to mexican coke, so i wasn't at all surprised he'd seek out sugar-sweetened pepsi.it's of little matter to me (i preferred american coke in every single test, and i'm a diet soda drinker, anyway), but john goes out of his way for pepsi throwback.i'll admit, i would grab the 12-pack of throwback over the regular pepsi because of my aversion to hfcs.
