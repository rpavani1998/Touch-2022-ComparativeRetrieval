[photo: robyn lee] john: for consistency's sake, we wanted all cans.
i'll admit, i would grab the 12-pack of throwback over the regular pepsi because of my aversion to hfcs.
what seems to me more relevant was that,in an exhaustive food lab, kenji tested "mexican coke" (made with sugar) against normal american coke (corn syrup).
carey: with a sample size of one, this isn't intended to "prove" that any one of these sodas is superior to another.
carey: john is loyal to mexican coke, so i wasn't at all surprised he'd seek out sugar-sweetened pepsi.
so we made sure a can got back to dry land for the taste test.
what surprised me is that i actually preferred corn syrup pepsi to sugar-sweetened coke.
john m. edwards is serious eats's former fast-food bureau chief and eats 85% of the food carey orders.
but after this taste test, i'm sticking to sugar when i can.
i don't care if there are sugar pills or ibuprofen in my advil bottle as long as my headache goes away.
your standard "mexican coke" comes in a bottle.
carey: turns out john was right about his own preferences, even in a blind taste-test.
john: given that i'd rather sip and muse about soda than be tested on it (and that monday night football was on), i figured we'd taste all four in unlabeled cups and call it a night.
we were on a weekend cruise (er, more on that later) leaving from bayonne, but the shiny new boat was built in germany, and they'd fully stocked their larders with german products, naturally enough.
i got excited about the teeny euro-style yogurt pots and drinking "coke light."
it did illustrate once again, though, thatthere are discernible differences between the colas, and between sugar-sweetened ones and standard american versions.

american pepsi, american coke, and pepsi throwback were easy enough.
(she'll roll her eyes and forgive me if i belch during taste tests, but half-assing it is not an option.)
html hints some html is ok: link, strong, em comment guidelines post whatever you want, just keep it seriously about eats, seriously.
but as more and more companies are introducing non-hfcs products, it's no surprise to see soda companies jump on the marketing bandwagon, introducing products likepepsi throwback, sweetened with good ol' sugar.

(and that john doesn't need to board another cruise ship for german sugar coke fix; a fifteen-second walk to the bodega for a pepsi will do.)
if you see something not so nice, please, report an inappropriate comment.
a few years ago,adam kuban tasted very little difference between pepsi throwback and the usual kind (and found a very slight office preference for throwback in a double-blind taste test).
carey: john is loyal to mexican coke, so i wasn't at all surprised he'd seek out sugar-sweetened pepsi.
if he doesn't really prefer it, that's a pretty big waste of time and money.
i don't care if there are sugar pills or ibuprofen in my advil bottle as long as my headache goes away.
so we made sure a can got back to dry land for the taste test.
it's of little matter to me (i preferred american coke in every single test, and i'm a diet soda drinker, anyway), but john goes out of his way for pepsi throwback.

to quote baudelaire, the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn't exist.
john: one of the most interesting takeaways, for me, was how consistently i noticed something odd about the hfcs.

he not only found that most tastersdon't prefer the sugar version, but thatthinking something was a mexican coke (or the experience of drinking it out of the bottle) had a huge impact.

(and john already has enough habits that waste time and money.)
i consistently preferred pepsi to coke (which didn't surprise me), and sugar-sweetened soda to corn-syrup soda.
