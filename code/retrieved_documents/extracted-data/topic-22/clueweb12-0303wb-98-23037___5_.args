unlike pepsi, though, we don't get to choose how we're tested and measured, so it's entirely possible that when these organizations release their findings, the true nature of in-store digital media won't be accurately portrayed.on the other hand, we continue to gain insight into how our product is best perceived and used, just like pepsi did.their efforts should make these networks more effective at engaging viewers and delivering the right messages at exactly the right place and time.because its influence is concentrated at the point of purchase, it will be most successful for categories that are already impulse- or activation-oriented.pepsi understood the strengths and weaknesses of their product, and engineered a test optimized in its favor.the latter part of the argument notwithstanding (since strategies forusing digital signage to build brands are entirely different from those using it to boost sales), we're once again confirming thatdigital signage content usually works best when delivered in short bursts.so when consumed in very small amounts (a few sips), it comes across as more flavorful.with that information, we can continue to get better at developing successful content strategies, optimizing network execution plans, and enjoying the sweet -- but not too sweet -- taste of success.we can then as an industry begin to capture consistent data and have a consistent view of the whole shopper insight medium.while you might just chalk it up to scripted tests and tv magic, pepsi also performed better in more scientific tests, and even coke admitted it.thankfully, under the skilled management of dunnhumby (which handles tesco's pop arrangements), the network is now thriving, and the group has even shared some of their secrets.though useful for encouraging switching, in-store video is not as good at building long-term brand loyalty."the alerts reported to be most effective are those for price-off events and new or seasonal items.editorial policy: article topics are selected by our writers and editors, with the goal of providing objective and useful information to the entire digital signage industry.they were able to legitimately say two out of three (or whatever the proper ratio is) preferred pepsi, conveniently leaving off the little asterisk explaining that this is only true when consumed a mere ounce or two at a time.
