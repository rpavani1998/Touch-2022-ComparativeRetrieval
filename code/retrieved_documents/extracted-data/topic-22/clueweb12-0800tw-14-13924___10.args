just a couple things to consider: in the golden glow of a couple of bourbon mojitos, your student debt is no longer a spiteful monkey on your back, but a fluffy white poodle in your lap.
oh well, at least you didn’t spend it on lattes.
i had exactly enough cash on me to cover my meal (pre calculated with tip included).
oh [...] [...] personal finance applies the latte factor to the amber fluid…beer.
my coworker who likes to act “generous” and pick up appetizers, etc, ended up spending almost $70.
i only drink maybe twice a month, and by mid-way down the drink i can feel it in my thighs.
you didn’t even talk about the biggest alcohol-related expense for me – buying drinks for girls in the hopes of getting their attention.
if you perfected the art of throwing money down that hole like me, then you also bought their friends drinks just to show what a high roller you were.
unfortunately, my coworkers started ordering rounds of shooters, and even though i declined to drink all but the first one, the ones ordered for me showed up on my bill (only the first couple of rounds, thank goodness.)
i shiver when i think about how much of my summer job money went into the bar scene.
i actually have more fun without drinking.
i think it’s a rule that if you correct someone else’s reading/grammar in a comment, you yourself will make a typo/grammar error.
i agree with the article for the most part, but not about the costs of coffee over beer.
boom, i just figured out why you’re struggling financially.
we actually have it on our list to do more.
i rarely go out however.
i could go on… alcohol fueled personal interaction isn’t more meaningful.
seriously though, i can’t even imagine how much i’ve saved over the years by not consuming alcohol.
99% of the time, my husband and i don’t order alcohol when we’re out.
haha, i love the writing style, too.
i went out to dinner with work folks a couple of weeks ago, and ended up spending $30 for half a turkey burger.

either people just don’t care, or they’ve found other areas to cut out of their budget so they can afford a nicecoffee sometimes.
plus, you’ll often get your drink for free, since they’ll just assume you’re the designated driver.
each of those drinks isn’t cheap either.
considering that the ingredients of the drink cost the place about 50 cents, that’s an awful big premium to pay for a little extra self confidence.
diet pepsi is miles better and i’m a coke guy myself.
we tend to get bogged down with work and the to do’s and don’t have fun like we used to.
i’m hoping this post changes your mind, since you’ll probably annoy me if we ever meet up and you’ve been drinking.
interesting what the kids call drinking before going out these days “pregaming”.
i actually don’t know because we brew all our coffee and expressos at home.
we save so much money.
we never buy a drink @ the bar – if we want a drink we want it with our meal.
however, we get the short end of the stick on vacations.
oh well, at least you didn’t spend it on lattes.
getting drunk is definitely overrated too.
generally, you don’t tend to consume more than one expensive coffee a day, yet most of us can attest to sitting down at a bar and not getting back up until half a dozen drinks have been polished off.
purveyors of beer know this fact.
yes guys, i’m talking about that favorite elixir that makes all ladies attractive to us, alcohol.

i always see people pointing out expenses such as coffee or dining out during lunch, but rarely alcohol.
he also once asked a girl to go out with him.
there are all sorts of reasons why cutting out alcohol is much more effective than coffee.
exploiting the morons that think they look cooler because they get to pay $$$ to pour their own drinks is genius.
only i would manage an embarrassing typo while making fun of someone’s intelligence.
used in small doses, alcohol can make an awkward guy slightly more charming or can help someone relax after a long day.
not for earning 6-figures of course, but for spending money in such a stupid way.
even the reasonably priced drinks locally will set you back a minimum of $6, once you tip the pretty girl who poured it for you.
great point about never hearing about the alcohol factor.
as long as you don’t hit on me, we could maybe make this happen.
smith wrote a good guest post on spf about some more costly things than “the latte factor”, like alcohol.
i was alone, so it didn’t matter to me.
by now, most of us have figured out that recurring small expenses have a way of adding up over time.
i attribute much of my vast wealth to the fact that i don’t drink – lol.
« your finances and a greener life home like the latte factor.

alcohol-fueled personal interaction is more meaningful and emotive, e.g. “i love you, man!”
in a lot of ways, peer pressure becomes even worse when you’re an adult.
pregaming, for those of you who aren’t cool like me, means you start drinking at home, getting a little drunk by the time you make it to the bar.
just once, i want you to go out with your friends and substitute diet coke for your favorite alcoholic beverage.
since my wife and i don’t drink, we don’t have to deal with the cost of alcohol…or the hidden costs (bar food).
if you overindulge though, the awkward guy becomes a blubbering moron and the guy who’s trying to relax starts to get excited about the most pointless things, meaning they’ve committed the same faux pas they set out to avoid.
i live in a sleepy small town, so we don’t really have any swanky bars in my neck of the woods.
i do enjoy a few pops and a scotch on the weekend.
i always crave pizza when i drink.
the drink added 15% to the bottom line of my bill.
these days i enjoy a glass of wine occasionally and don’t really drink excess…yes, old and boring and three kids have slowed me down.

i sometimes think restaurants do this on purpose – sit you at the bar to guilt trip you into buying drinks you never intended to purchase.
i just had a salad for lunch and now i’m hungry too.
whenever a place has a great deal for an “all-inclusive” package, it’s only a great price for people who drink.
moderation is the key for both fitness/health and the wallet.
also, one might argue drinking to forget your problems isn’t the most effective way to deal with your problems.
but we don’t go to pubs or bars more than once a year, and even then, we usually go shoot pool.
the kids call it pregaming, and while i can’t say i approve of drinking to excess, this is a way to at least get the cost down.
used in small doses, alcohol can make an awkward guy slightly more charming or can help someone relax after a long day.

as a teetotaler myself, i can attest to the pressure you’ll get from your friends to join them in their boozing ways.

we don’t drink much (only on weekends), so our policy is that when we do drink we get good stuff.
i’d recommend against it, since drunk people are generally kind of annoying when you’re sober.
you know what takes the latte-factor/booze factor to a whole new level: bottle service.

if you do that just 3 days a week, that’s close to $10 a week, which is over $500 per year.
nelson has successfully cooked rice on several occasions.
no booze in it though.
someone earning 6-figures should know better than to pay 5 times (or more) the retail cost of a bottle just to work to pour their own drinks.
i also prefer diet pepsi and coke zero to diet coke.
the same exact bottle of wine (same year, same vineyard) that i can buy at the liquor store for $18 costs $35 at my local restaurant.

never had any trouble with not drinking.
for instance, if you buy a latte at the local tim horton’s of starbucks, you’re shelling out like 3 bucks a trip.
as much as i’ve read about the latte factor, i’ve read next to nothing about cutting out another drink that’s overpriced, habit forming and can affect your behavior as well.
even the reasonably priced drinks locally will set you back a minimum of $6, once you tip the pretty girl who poured it for you.
i don’t really drink much, but when i started trying to spend only $200/month on groceries, i dropped even more!

beer makes you more attractive and vastly improves your dancing (at least in one’s own mind).
last night, i actually, unwillingly, had a drink when i went out to the keg.

i have no tolerance these days anyways, so i save a lot of money.
i join spf in defense of alcohol and all things wonderful.

nice wines ($20 to $40 per bottle; my girlfriend is from france and has very discerning tastes..with few exceptions the wines over $50 aren’t that much better for those under $40), and good beer.
pregaming, for those of you who aren’t cool like me, means you start drinking at home, getting a  little drunk by the time you make it to the bar.
that’s why beer is served in large quantities in venues likely to be infested with dancing fools.
i don’t drink, but it is surely cheaper that way.
as long as there’s a few of you at the table, the wait staff will be happy to keep refilling your soda for free, since they’re getting ample tips from the others at the table.
i agree – alcohol is expensive, especially if you are not going to remember the night anyway.
if you do that just 3 days a week, that’s close to $10 a week, which is over $500 per year.
not that we are striving to become alcoholics but it mainly represents the need for us to loosen up and have more fun.
i guarantee the latte folks aren’t making that much off a coffee, yet they always get the bad rap.

i rarely have alcohol when i’m out because the markups are so ridiculous, at least in restaurants.
it’s a way of stretching your drinking dollar.
when anyone razed me because i wasn’t being socialable and drinking with them, i would remind them that being socialable was a two-way street and they could also be socialable and not drink with me.
but because i was sitting at the bar, i felt obliged to buy a drink, especially since i was eating there.
just once, i want you to go out with your friends and substitute diet coke for your favorite alcoholic beverage.
i was trying to be frugal, and wasn’t that hungry, so split a meal with one of the girls.
