so one of the guys popped out for a bit and came back with 6 two litre bottles of brown fizzy pop so we could setup our own test.
you could tell there was a difference, but it was really hard identifying if the difference was a manufacturer difference (coke/pepsi) or a variety difference (coke/coke zero).
it was a site to be seen, and great fun too.
well, what an afternoon it was - a bunch of techies, some of which are die-hard fizzy pop drinkers, all umming and ahhing, swishing and sniffing like wine connoisseurs.
well, you'd be right if you were only trying to distinguish between coke and pepsi, or diet and full fat, but our challenge was to correctly identify all 6 bottles, side-by-side.
my stomach was becoming very bloated from swigging all that fizzy pop and the sugar was starting to work it's magic on my teeth and sugar levels.
the point was to prove that given a blind test, most people really can't tell the difference between coke, coke zero, pepsi and pepsi max, and i was one of them.
there weren't any rules other than you just had to correctly identify all 6 bottles.

it was easy to identify the diet coke and diet pepsi - they are distinctly different from the others due to the type of sweeteners used - but correctly identifying the others proved to be much harder.
the labels were removed and replaced with generic a, b, c, d, e and f labels (the original contents were noted before and correlated to the new labels), the lids mixed up and then the bottles shuffled ready for the challenge.
conveniently, the bottles themselves are identical.

you could sample them in any order and as many times as you liked.
