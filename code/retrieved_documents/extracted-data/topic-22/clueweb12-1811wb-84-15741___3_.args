she suffered from poor facial placement.(pepsi is way better...but that's an argument better left for another day)Â  so when you're somewhere that they call everything coke what if it's pepsi?in fact, the problem with her face was that although her head was totally normal - her face was kind of small - and it was lower on her head than it should have been.okay so i'm warning you in advance that this entry is going to go awry quickly.so i checked out her forehead to see if it was possible that she had a five-head and that was the problem.well, here in ca i call everything "cola" coke.okay - so i know that soda and coke and pop and whatever is called different things in different areas.so, apparently i have a new sense of clarity that allows me to really analyze - well, everything.it will be like spending the day with an add kid.so today, i had fast food - the worst of all fast food even.i need to drink more water because tanning makes you dehydrated (oh pool boy?!)seriously, it started because i need to drink more water.so today, at the bank, i saw a lady with a weird face.everything i know about hiking...i learned wearing flip flops adventures of a smartass.she did have an unusually large forehead, but it was not caused by the usual strange hairline that most five-headed people have.
