this is not well executed simplicity.
i also really like the type drop shadow on the "before" coke can.
on jun.29.2007 at 09:19 am i think it's especially important they did this with all the varieties and flavors coke now comes in.
it radiates confidence in the coke brand.
i think this is a bold move in the right direction, as the over-saturation of unnecessary (and frivolous) graphic design typically feels like a cover up for a sub-par product.
plus, you are right, with the changing beverage world of waters and teas, etc.
thus the updated harlequin coke can would look like the can in this taiwanese advertisement: so borning.
they've not completely abandoned the frills, though - go look at packaging and ads for sprite, vault, and some of their other non-coke brands.
on jul.02.2007 at 03:25 pm lovely.
plus those cans remind me of those cheap high caffeine energy drinks, not good.
this goes for logos and packaging.
also, i don't feel like you can tout the way the barcodes and tables integrate into the old can at all.
i like the simplicity of the design, but the design was poorly executed.
coca-cola is acknowledging that we all know the product, so just drink it.
if i could sum up my general feeling on mass-market packaging (in the united states), i’d say it sucks.
i agree, absolutely pure and beautiful.
it was so clean and simple.
but the new bottles with the flat red label color is boring!on jul.11.2007 at 10:53 am > they're inelegant and don't communicate a thing any more.
i'd love to see that reality reflected on their packaging.
when small percentage points of market share can mean hundreds of millions of dollars, you can kind of understand.
though if i saw this design next to one of the more graphic cans, i would most definately pick up the more graphic.
the diet soft drink category has suffered.
on jun.29.2007 at 01:52 pm "many would contend that the lil john and master p cds are not good design" â€â¦
while we're on a soda topic...i say...get rid of plastic bottles and bring back those beautiful, recyclable glass bottles.
i think thatâ€â¢s when they added the diagonal hairlines in the back too.
it's a draw as far as i can see, and i doubt the can alone will do much to improve sales.
on jun.29.2007 at 11:53 am wow.
my opinion, for what it's worth, is this is an effective design; as effective as the first hundred times they used it.
maybe i wasn't their target, and most often for companies this large anglos around the globe are the main target and they will have sub-identities for the world's minorities.
marketing people love gimmicks like bubbles, lens flares etc.
my initial reaction when i saw it in stores was that they were following the sprite strategy, which renamed diet sprite as sprite zero (and lost the diet language completely).
seen in that light, the restrained, back-to-basics approach of coke is a welcome sight in this market, at least to me.
on jun.29.2007 at 02:13 pm the striking thing about the new can to me isn't the lack of graphics, it's that red; it blazes.
sales went back up immediately.
jul.09.2007 at 08:21 am i think the point here is that we can't move forward with understanding the latest coke design while we, as designers, do not learn how to discuss a design.
i felt it all started going bad when they changed it to the faux-futuristic, eras-like type with the grey band shadowing the dynamic ribbon device.
the australian cans, while i agree that they look more like energy drinks, i believe they are going in the right direction where simplicity is concerned.
on jul.01.2007 at 12:41 am agreed - the new old is a welcome return.
this is a great tie-in to the really nice tv ads i've seen featuring the posterized red bottle and bubbles...very cool.
someone compared this coke change to apple changing it's identity/packaging and going for simple, no clutter, but that can't be compared to this, because with the script type "coca-cola" and same old design in general, it really seems like it's meant to be nastalgic, not necessarily simple and modern, as it's been suggested.
the rest were just a repetition of the other: the design is good, they loved it, and coke is my favorite soda.
all that unanimous praise is seriously disappointing me (not a very constructive thing to say - but i really feel so).on jun.29.2007 at 08:31 am if only consumers would learn how to be monolithic this would all be so much easier...
in that perspective, it has as much use and reason to exist as the wave (which expresses dynamism, flow...).
are they ever going to remove the word "classic" there is no need for it anymore!on jul.10.2007 at 01:01 pm ditch the wordmark, ditch the "classic" keep the wave.
on jul.11.2007 at 03:01 pm perhaps there is a cultural difference at play here.
of course some could argue that it will not please the consumer, but it is the job of the designers and company to teach the consumer about what's good and what's not.
it’s a tough challenge, and coke’s really pulled out a beauty here.
on jul.10.2007 at 02:36 am i like the previous logo better, this newer logo looks too plain and the dynamic ribbon looks like a line of cocaine.
again, not so right sounding.
on jun.29.2007 at 02:29 pm although not coke but is cola can realated
but if the point was to act "less-is-more", it clearly failed in my perspective.
i would posit that the new design is superior to the old as it gives more surface area to show off the bubbles and condensation which arise on the can as it is exposed to room temp.
on dec.03.2008 at 06:00 am here in mexico, this logo arrived in the beginning of this year... and it looks really great!
this modernist obsession is getting creepy.
regarding the aussie can : the circle-bottle-graphic and the slimness of the can indeed give it an energy-drink look, and are likely unneeded.
they’ve given similar treatment to the majority of the coke line, including diet and zero.
the beverage maker said monday that the new look can will hit the japanese market on jan 29 before its introduction to the world market in march.
but i would like to think that the designers are smart enough to know how important the condensation is to the visceral experience of drinking soda.
look closely at the promotional photos of the new cans (and not just in these examples you found): they all have water droplets on the cans to substitute for the ones that used to be painted on.
we must expand our vocabulary and move beyond "good," "love it," etc. just because one happens to like one design it doesn't mean it is the best.
i hope it last!on jun.29.2007 at 10:00 am all the comments on how the font on the new can is too large, while praising the previous design confuses me.
oh but kuddos to the coke team for their design sense...
as for the roots; they cater to a completely different demo than lil john (rap vs hiphop; flamboyant culture vs a conscious culture).
i make the assumption that this was because the connotation of "diet" in the marketplace was changing dramatically (witness all the "zero" beverages) and they couldn't support a unique positioning for it any longer.
(if you want to see a large collection of cans, dating way back to the 50s, checkthis site out.)
only thing cooler than the coke 'de-design' would be a pepsi 'de-design'!
on jun.29.2007 at 01:06 pm i don't think sheer nostalgia is what will sell this.
i'd kill to see the 16 oz. glass bottles come back.
only problem i had with it is that i was in no way prepared for it.
on jun.28.2007 at 11:12 pm this is awesome.
the larger personality aspects of the brand are communicated through other marketing channels, of which packaging is just one.
on jun.29.2007 at 02:07 pm i'm only 20 and this design reminds of good times when soda cans were drinkable.
on jun.29.2007 at 04:08 pm less is more.
the older cans weren't good graphic design.
i wonder if all those who have said that the new coke design is "great" (whatever that is supposed to mean) just say so because if given the opportunity they wouldn't have done better than what that latest design did.
drops done well do that.
i did notice in stores, that the 2l bottles have a few sparce bubbles splattered about.
i love the logo and the red color.
this just looks like those dharma packagings in lost (sorry for the poor reference, let's try again).
it's elegant, it's sleek, and sophisticated and yet so simple in it's execution.
on jul.03.2007 at 01:56 pm i agree with laura those austrailan coke cans look too empty, they're missing something.
the sound of opening a can of coke is one more very powerful element of the coke experience.
there is effective, there is popular, elegant even; but certainly not "good" or "bad".
in this instance, the can is simply an icon and should look contemporary but not overdone, and they've achieved that.
i am bored to tears of that design!on jul.10.2007 at 04:19 pm love it.
"you're an idiot, this is an elegant design.
using the existing product logos with the super clean, flat, modern graphics on the can seems like visual disconnect to me.
on jun.29.2007 at 01:27 am ditto the kudos.
by recognizing that the majority of american consumers know this product so well, emphasizing refreshment and water condensation and fizziness via the can graphics is simply unnecessary.
(but they could get a middle schooler to add inner and outer beveling and maybe some chrome effects and i'd still buy it, *if* they would just let us poor folks in the usa have real coke with sugar in it
note that the coke can design prior to the yellow ribbon was pretty much the exact same design.
on the one hand, it was decisive for coke to go from all the afore-mentioned elements to the few that are there now.
the yellow ribbon was a selling of advertising space on behalf of coke to mcdonald's which happened back in 2002/2003.
i would say to the couple nay-sayers here that the beauty of this design is that it allows people young an old and from each sub-culture to endow their own feelings and meaning to this iconic brand.
but i haven't bothered to research in to either of the companies advertising interests (other than the obvious fact the coke products are supplied by mcdonald's).
i thought it was coke lite, but can't remember and no longer see it on the shelves.
clean lines on solid color can make quite the impact, but they missed the mark and my demographic as well.
i would love it if many, many other products would follow suit.
on the other hand, with the exception that the swoop looks a little different and that the classic is all small caps (which is very smart, and whether or not that should even be there, i'll let someone else have the opinion)â€”with those exceptions, the can does basically look like the old one.
that simple intervention has the ability to de-dramatize the can, to give it a more human and accessible feeling.
what made them change those colors???on jun.30.2007 at 05:06 pm this is very nice.
for years, it has been a stand-alone product, i.e. the design was independent of the red classic can.
pay only attention to the companies that only service that demographic and see how much their ads vary.
if i could sum up my general feeling on mass-market packaging (in the united states), i’d say it sucks.
they have stripped all of the coke design down.
it is truly classic, and because of coke's history, it will always be a good design to fall back on.
the ribbon of yellow appeared, and then weeks later you would have started to see coupons for mcdonald's appearing on select coke packaging.
just to save moneyon dec.12.2007 at 10:48 am coca cola is a christian company it is not good it has cafine(drug) and it is teasing islam.
i disagree that the australian cans are "how it should be".
all that said, as a consumer who probably drinks, shamefully, 3 or 4 cokes a day, i was confused by the new coke design.
i was ecstatic when i saw the new can for the first time; thanks for giving it mention here.
here is the brand-speak which of course makes absolutely no sense but cost 100 kazillion dollars.
i think this was one of their best selling albums.
on jun.30.2007 at 08:45 pm about time.
i was more referring to the lack of wave, the smallness and position of the logo and the almost equal treatment of the names.
can't stand today's stuff.)on jun.29.2007 at 10:53 pm regarding the coke classic can, personally, i think it's a home run!
all the extra bits and doodads and extraneous graphics are gone.
on jun.30.2007 at 04:20 am i completely remember that sight in supermarkets especially that old sprite "lymon" logo.
i mean it wasn't original,it added only another color, and just made the logo more complicated.
it makes me proud to drink coke again.
it has even less meaning than the water-droplets, and way way less functions than that old little touch of yellow.
on jun.29.2007 at 12:05 pm tom â€“ââ coke's introduction of coke zero typifies that confusion.
it smells like some carpet cleaning chemical.
get rid of the nice water droplets on the new photo of coke 2.
as you said in contrast to "pepsi's blow-it-all-out how-many-designs-can-we-produce-in-a-summer strategy" this makes it really easy to distinguish which product is what with the simplest possible visual cues.
they used the version of the logo that had been slimmed down to be used with strokes (edges) of a different colour.
too bad she wasn't wearing more rings.
as a disclaimer, i'm a snooty designer who happens to believe that coke is the greatest chemical concoction mankind has ever invented.
and fail at it, both graphically and communicatively : they're inelegant and don't communicate a thing any more.
i've never drunk a coke or pepsi in my life but i'll definately buy that can and place it next to my classic 8 oz.
yes, coke will probably save money on printing costs, though i find it hard to believe they would go to this aesthetic solely for that purpose (but i'm just a naive student).
so happy someone had the balls to actually go 'no' to anymore add ons and decided to actually take all of it away to reveal the beauty underneath.
i really like the clean lines and simplicity of the new/redesign, like so many others wrote before me.
on jul.30.2007 at 03:08 pm beautiful, now if pepsi would just follow their lead.
the designer in me loves the simple, uncluttered can but its a whole new ball game when looking into that 2-way mirror.
nice going, td!on jun.24.2008 at 10:30 pm gotham is sooo trendy right nowon jun.26.2008 at 02:35 am i absolutely love the new (original) design being brought back.
having been there in the 90's, i can tell you the reason a coke package can end up with a million appendages is because the brand marketing mba's spend millions of hours writing brand strategies that talk about effervescence and refreshment and believe that each package should communicate everything!
what i like about the new can is it actually has more bravado than the old can.
the people don't know what they want.
plus, i almost renamed the title "fall'n inta ya" but, that would've been too much.
the placement and size of the logo seems the same.
i just remembered that i have a cool coke bottle from my visit to croatia that i will try to take a dig pic of and post later.
everything all over the world, but still retained ownership of this tm, they could get a loan off it's value to start over completely.
on jun.29.2007 at 08:02 pm i bet "classic" is still on there because of the lawyers!on jun.29.2007 at 08:29 pm
so it thrills me to no end when someone of stature refuses to do it anymore.
at some point, there are only so many variations one can do on ribbons, splashes, swooshes, dimensional type and fake water droplets.
and yeah i would not want to be michael jackson for any money in the world.
or i might be biased as i immediately recognized the design closer to the pre-new coke debacle and was encouraged and gratified by this return to form.
this is coke cashing in on their brand recognition.
i first thought he was writing out the auditory experience of opening a can of coke.
if everyone drank cola the world would be a better place x i'd really like to see the coca-cola company bring back the so-called harlequin design that appeared on cans in the mid to late 1960s:on nov.03.2007 at 07:46 pm i love the return to the original.
the red can and white script speak everything the world has come to know or needs to know about the brand.
(which was getting pretty ludicrous, because where has anyone ever found 'new coke' since classic was reintroduced?)on dec.03.2008 at 02:19 pm to introduce a non-visual talking point, when seeing a large red coke can and reading jonsel's "....bzzz....snap....crackle...awheeeeeeyoooooo...distortion....static....fade out...."
i think it is time for all of us to admit that we are not the center of the design universe, and while it is fine to say that we don't like or appreciate something; it is not our place to try to hold every logo that is released to our individual standards.
but corey is right, coke remains coke and its millions, its need to please all worldwide and i'm not ever expecting anything brilliant to come from them anyway.
the new can looks stunning in person.
on jul.01.2007 at 09:53 pm by the way, this is what our newest cans look like in australia.
all the extra bits and doodads and extraneous graphics are gone.
on feb.21.2009 at 03:40 am as we move into a new chapter of brand new — and a new commenting mechanism — all posts published before june 2009 have been closed for comments.
the blatant exception to all of this mumbo jumbo i said is the 2012 olympics logo.
that's an interesting pepsi bottle-can/can-bottle.
it is the job of the designer to tell people what they want because they don't know.
on jun.29.2007 at 12:07 am i favor pepsi (well actually, dr. pepper/mr.pibb), but this new clean can would get me to pick up a six-pack or two.
on jun.28.2007 at 10:48 pm that's a beautiful, apple-like simplification and product differentiation.
the more line extensions they add, the more they seem confused to have brands like diet and cherry coke be their own brand or flavor extensions.
on sep.11.2007 at 12:04 pm interesting that the initial comments commend coke for getting rid of the fake water droplets, bu the pictures of the new designs have actual water droplets.
obviously because we [designers] were all educated in similar educational programs, read the same magazines, and studied the same "old masters" we tend to have an idea about what "good" and "bad" designs are.
look at the color of the golden arches and other mcdonald's products.
it is certainly clean, but it's the same old thing; no creativity; just a reaching back to an old design and calling it retro or classic as a means to explain why coke should write a check for the design.
to me, the font is the same size - they simply dropped the bevels, shading, and 3-d effects.
i love how the white text and curved line seems to cutting into the red so cool.
i kept thinking, as someone mentioned earlier, that they were old cans, until i realized i was seeing the cans with that design in more than one location.
from what i have heard, this trademark is so valuable, that if the company lost everything - buildings, equipment, people, facilities, etc.
it was only in cvs and i thought it was a pepsi product until i got a closer look.
to me that's something i can get behind.
if they head ears, i definitely would at least once have shouted back at them in the store, presumably not in a very mannered way.
i couldn't remember who or when, but i once saw an interview of the guy behind the yellow stroke (it got him famous).
on jun.29.2007 at 12:31 am the other media looks great, too, following this "classic" approach.
this is because, they recognize the limitations of a design, even a good one, when distributed on a global scale.
on jun.29.2007 at 11:20 am my personal feeling on the diet coke brand is that coca-cola really doesn't quite know what to do with it.
" "what, we are supposed to give the people what they want.
also, the aluminum 20 ounce cans are stunning, if you've had a chance to check them out.
again.)on jul.01.2007 at 04:16 am it took real smarts to fight off the more-is-more design attitude of many similar products.
surprisingly, the guy seemed to say the yellow stripe is a huge part of what brought coke back to live subversively.
i can only guess this was a compromise with the higher ups.
the other re-rebranding elements are nice as i love "classic" designs, and maybe that was their focus more so than the packaging itself.
on jun.29.2007 at 11:19 am i really think coke is running out of ideas because the ability to distinguish between one brand from another is becoming exceedingly difficult.
coke got it right: this can is perfect.
they made a mistake with the new cans.
the can will change again in a few years 2.
its kind of like wiping the slate clean but at the same time laying a new foundation for which it can be built upon, because no doubt it will be.
i really like the new design; it's simple and, in my opinion, somewhat elegant.
when small percentage points of market share can mean hundreds of millions of dollars, you can kind of understand.
on jul.10.2007 at 01:10 pm as a graphic design student, i am definitely not as experienced in the field as perhaps a few who have commented here, but what i can say is: when designing, make a decisive choice for every element in a design, otherwise it looks like a mistake...
those marks are big and bold and i believe that weight and energy causes them to look floaty in all that space not at home in it.
maybe coke is conceding the african-american audience to pepsi with this, or maybe not screaming above the energy drink cans with aggressive colors and logos is going to hurt their market share with teenagers.
at the end of the day coca colas will sell by the bucketload regardless of what can it comes in.
honestly, if i saw this can on the shelf next to it's predecessor i would assume they were years-old overstock and grab the more detailed can.
on sep.05.2007 at 04:33 pm oh how wonderful the "new-old" can looks, but look what was released along with it in their new campaign...
(kind of like the music industry trends... all the young ppl of each generation find what we grew up with and considered 'normal' to be all retro and cool, so by going back to a clean design, it also becomes a new canvas for the next generation of designers and consumers to build upon... 3.it has also clearly streamlines the fact that it's the base flavour leaving the "cherry and vanilla etc" flavours to have something that differs from the original.. p.s love those pepsi cans above, it's a real shame they don't use them
i'm also from australia, but i have the new us cans and love them.
coca-cola does indeed eliminate the word classic off the can.
i would so very much like toilet-paper-packagings not to be as "communicative".
on nov.04.2007 at 12:06 am on second thought, i'd like to see the word "coke" changed to the font that you see on the new diet coke cans.
advertising and marketing can build specific experiences and connections with the differnt target groups, while this icon stands strong and grows more valuable.
on jun.30.2007 at 08:29 pm btw i would much prefer seeing real droplets on a can, than fake ones... fake is no good, fake will never make me think "yes thats fresh" i dont need to see sparkles and bubbles, i already know its coke form the logo on it.
and i'm sure those same people would agree that the celine dion cd isn't good design either.
it helps to elevate the type from the surface and therefore stand out, giving a flat surface some dimension.
to me it looks as though they got lazy and decided to look at an ancient can and carbon copy it.
when drinking a good and refined whine, i like to see it being poured from a refined bottle.
on jun.29.2007 at 10:20 am i suspect the client isn't as confident as the designer about reverting to the simplified look.
i'm still not completely sure of the difference between diet coke and coke zero (preferring to just go with the hard stuff when i have it), but at least i can separate them visually.
well dont to all the coke designerson aug.24.2007 at 02:08 pm it is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo coolon sep.04.2007 at 08:04 pm in canada, classic isn't even on their labels anymore.
the original design was very silver, similar to diet coke.
many would contend that the lil john and master p cds are not good design (myself included), but the record label that sells the cds would say that the design is perfect.
simplicity, clean lines, gorgeous.
i used to collect coca-cola memorabilia such as cans and bottles etc and i often wondered why they needed to change from what they used to have which was simple and beautiful to the monsters they unleashed on shelf.
it ain't coke without the curved stripe.
you know it, you know you love it, so screw all the other stuff.
its great to see coke doing somthing like this, but i believe there's value in the "before" can as well.
i just wanted to voice the hope that the branding of their websites, tv-spots and other marketitng will follow this newfound simplicity.
i am willing to bet it either flopped or pepsi sued them but i can't find that info.
but, to assume that the american public prefers simple is absurd because us pesky consumers refuse to just become monolithic drones who think and act the same way.
just noticed this prototype, and would much rather see this on the shelves instead of pepsi's current designgasmson jun.29.2007 at 03:31 pm
since new coke is no longer produced, the word "classic" on its product serves only as a reminder of its marketing blunder.
doesn't mean it is bad or good, just means that they missed my demo.
those australian cans really show how it should be.
on jun.30.2007 at 12:20 amon jun.30.2007 at 12:20 am uhhhh...sight not site.
the more voices talking at the same time, the harder it becomes to hear/understand the message.
see the great work of duffy design from the 90's on diet coke, minute maid, fruitopia, etc.
i suspect, although i don't have the data to back this up, that a potential drinker is likely to have a more positive appreciation for a can which supports that natural process and shows the user that the temperature of the coke is perfect rather than a fake set of bubbles or condensation or a design which is so busy it does not lend itself to showing off this aspect of the soda drinking experience.
if the aussies like the cans (and this guy too) then that is probably why they were launched there and not here.
they are going to loose market-share with this, and luckily we'll be back to the old soon.
(if you want to see a large collection of cans, dating way back to the 50s, checkthis site out.)
as i myself prefer coke over the other colas, i was taken aback by the latest reincarnation of this classic.
anyhow, as design director of coke, she said you would not believe how hard it was to redesign the can and not have bubbles on the cans!
and now my only fear is that sales may shift because of some price of an ingredient in argentina or whereever and this very appropriate design will be blamed.
on jun.29.2007 at 02:39 pm i really like it, and seeing that vintage red can cinches it.
an african-american ghetto (the projects).
it's also possible that coke has realized how hard it is to be all things to all people.
the new coke can works for a certain demographic, but certainly not mine.
granted, i saw my share of that in europe as well, but there seems to be more willingness over there to give a product personality without overdoing it.
on jul.03.2007 at 03:55 pm the yellow stripe is very uncessary.
the advertising and primary marketing channels (i see the can as secondary here) will drive the messaging.
so i'd love to hear the story on how 'design' won out over marketings usual role of being a 'serial design killer.
your own nostalgia ainâ€â¢t helping to understand why â€œnew/oldâ€â designs work.
have a look at where the top of the "c" from cola goes through the l, and compare it to the picture of the old 80s can.
i just hope that this possible negative influence on sales will not be "blamed" to the new design, only to the lack of communicating it.
on jul.01.2007 at 06:40 am i like the new/old simplicity but having seen the coke can from the seventies that mark posted i think that one rocks even more - it comes across mac/apple-ish as can be.
coca-cola is acknowledging that we all know the product, so just drink it.
at this point, coke doesn't need to "communicate" anything beyond the fact that it's a can of coke.
in that respect the best design might very well include as much color field as possible to give the condensation bubbles ample room to show off.
(which, in a way, who cares if it looks like an energy drink cuz everybody knows its coke and they could always go back to the old way if it lost money in sales from the lack of "recognition" on the shelf, which probably wouldn't happen) i would've been thrilled if the australian version is the new can i saw in stores here, even if it does look have it's design flaws.
this is not well executed simple design, this is non-design.
i grabbed a couple of each and stowed them away safely.
the font is much to large and overall quite boring to look at.
on jul.06.2007 at 07:58 pm got an old can (the previous can) and a new can yesterday at a local restaurant, an both brought them home.
the original design they are trying to resemble the dynamic ribbon looked better.
on jul.11.2007 at 03:19 pm as much as i love simplistic design, i do find it hard to get excited about a can of coke.
they’ve given similar treatment to the majority of the coke line, including diet and zero.
where will they put santa?!on jul.09.2007 at 03:48 pm they're inelegant and don't communicate a thing any more.
if i remember well, it was added after the new coke fiasco.
on jul.02.2007 at 02:59 pm i want the yellow stripe back.
but yeah it's a nice clean look, i just cant get too excited about iton jul.20.2007 at 07:47 am
this is stricktly due to knowing that it was canned sometime this decade.
i can't see muddying that up with a bunch of effects.
you just don’t see that all too often from one of the largest brands in the world and i certainly appreciate it.
on jun.29.2007 at 11:12 am beautiful.
i guess to you coke is like toilet paper.
i'm still not going to drink it (nothing short of the promise of riches could get me to buy coke)
on jul.01.2007 at 08:27 pm i wish they would go back to the old â€œcokeâ€â wordmark rendered in century book.
on jun.29.2007 at 11:58 am jon - that has been a struggle for coke for 20+ years.
contrast this with jiffy lube, which flushed whatever recognition they had down the toilet.
shoot the before can as nice as the "new" one 3.
on jun.29.2007 at 02:24 pm btw this this can isn't based on nostalgia if it was they would use the old mark from like the 70s if you notice that the the curved line was a bit more different back then.
on jan.06.2009 at 10:54 pm still looks excellent puts pepsi to shame.
the starkness was lost in the horrible additions in the past can.
and i agree this design will appel to the new younger and current market.
on jun.29.2007 at 10:23 am there was recently a light brand of coke released in my area that came in a blue can; did anyone else see it, or know the name of it.
i don't find it lacking communication.
converting coke zero to a primarily black can was a smart move (along with elimination of c2...).
nice to see that coke had the confidence to proudly show it's brand maturity which has lasted so many years.
if the new can has the metallic look, fine.
at some point, there are only so many variations one can do on ribbons, splashes, swooshes, dimensional type and fake water droplets.
on jul.03.2007 at 07:56 pm i don't even like coke, but this design is beautiful in it's simplicity.
so in essence they are using the current mark not the old one.
on jul.08.2007 at 02:26 pm the yellow stripe brings warmth, and tones the whole thing down a bit.
tell that to your next client who does not understand the value of design.
of course i'm a big fan of the simpler, retro stylings.
it’s a tough challenge, and coke’s really pulled out a beauty here.
it actually dates the can quite a bit...if you look at it next to the new, clean version.
an identity this well produced does not happen with out a design thinking champion on the inside!
that was a good choice, in my opinion, considering the clutter driven design we see every day.
it is going to be cheaper to print, so it is a winner in that regard, but not as artistic.
if the "after" can communicates anything, it says "coke".
by the way, that retro pepsi can rox!
on jun.29.2007 at 11:58 am simple and beautiful, i love it.
in the last redesign (with all the fizzies and bubbles), they brought it back to being a sub-brand of classic coke.
there's either too much uselessness for it to be elegant or too few elements for it be communicative.
i agree with dianette, coca-cola always had great designs...
on jun.29.2007 at 08:40 pm corey: i actually had some fun doing that celine dion cd cover.
turner duckworth, the designers of the current coke graphics, just won the first ever design lion at the cannes advertising festival.
sorry, but it really takes to be an american to be fooled by coca-cola's trying to be "the real thing" in packaging (as pedro shows with more diplomacy in his comment above).on
now if they will go back to having awesome musical jingles like "coke is it" from the 80's that would be awesome!
they were overly commercial, but had the merit to effectively communicate something, that was actually quite correct.
then when i finally realized it was a coke product i thought it was a concession that their competitor's color was better.
so yes, i rather have something that's ugly but dynamic, and that fits the feelings drinking coke could get me, rather than something ugly, and ugly, and also just plain ugly.
i think they got rid of that logo to look different from coca-cola.
thankfully, in design, you can undo.
on jun.29.2007 at 05:09 pm the new "old" design is a step in the right direction.
jun.28.2007 at 11:39 pm just saw moira cullen at an aiga retreat and she was proudly showing off her cans.
on jun.29.2007 at 10:47 am i thought you guys knew what a beautiful can looks like.
far better than the dreck we've seen the past 10 years or so.
so it thrills me to no end when someone of stature refuses to do it anymore.
on dec.03.2008 at 11:18 am the coca-cola cans here in vancouver have now dropped the 'classic'.
on jun.29.2007 at 02:56 pm kudos to coke ... another example of a smart corporation embracing design rather than abusing it or seeing it as an afterthought.
yes this is excellent keep it simple, clean and drinkable.
