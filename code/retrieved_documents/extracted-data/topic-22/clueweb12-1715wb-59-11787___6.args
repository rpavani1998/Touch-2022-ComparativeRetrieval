it beats any other soft drinks any time.
i personally prefers coke becos i like their advertisements better.
and the taste will be more delicious when u keep it unopened for a period of time.

1 do system investigation surveys at least one per week most of the time.
when i drink coke, it gives a very satisfying fragrant aroma and leaves a very delightful smooth feeling on my tongue.
