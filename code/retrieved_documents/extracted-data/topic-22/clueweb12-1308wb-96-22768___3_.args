in essence, the coke brand – and the way our brain processes it – is so powerful, that we literally, biochemically and physiologically, enjoy coke more when we can see and associate the coke brand with the beverage that we are drinking.in more recent research replicating these results, scientists have actually shown using neurological imaging scans that the brain actually responds differently to a blind-taste-test version of coke, than a version of coke where the subject sees and knows that it’s coke.so the bottom line is that the research – both with respect to branding overall, and the value of the marks in particular given their rigor – indicates that public awareness of the requirements for cfp certification and branding of the cfp marks really does have value, at least to the extent that the marketing/advertising efforts themselves are delivered properly and effectively.yet as the research shows, consumersdid choose coke in large part because of its brand, and actually enjoyed the taste of coke more as a result.however, the focus-group research showed that the marks can only be a factor if/when/once the consumer actually becomes familiar with the ethics, experience, education, and examination requirements that the marks entail.in other words – at least as far as the research is concerned – pepsi actually “tastes” better than coke, but doesn’t taste as good as coke plus coke’s brand value (or viewed another way,coke has a stronger brand than pepsi and as a result influences people's opinions of which soda tastes better - good thing they have a strong branding campaign!).certainly, i won’t deny that the ability to communicate effectively with prospective clients and to inculcate a trust relationship is crucial to an individual’s decision-making process about who to work with for financial guidance.in response, pepsi initiated the so-called “pepsi challenge” where consumers were given two unidentified soft drinks (one coke, one pepsi), were instructed to try each and report which one they liked better, and after-the-fact found out which one they had chosen.they choose to work with me because of my individual trustworthiness, credibility, and ability to deliver the guidance they need.branding is an often misunderstood phenomenon; in part, i think that’s because we as financial planners are not trained in marketing, but more significantly i think it’s because, as research on branding itself ironically shows, we are often not even aware of the impact that branding is actually having on our own decision-making process.in the initial version, coke conducted an extensive series of taste tests where consumers were presented with a can of coke and a can of pepsi, tasted each one, and reported which one tasted better; the majority of consumers chose coke.in addition, it is notable that in support of the cfp board’s own pre-research (see their extensive discussion in thiscfp board certificant connection video) in considering the public awareness initiative, they conducted significant focus-group marketing research, and their results indicated that in fact, the value and virtues of the cfp marks are so significant that consumers actuallydo state that the marks would be a material factor in their decision-making process.so not only does the impact of a solid brand have an incredible impact – it doesn’t just affect our choice, it actually changes the experienceitself to be more positive when we can associate a good brand with the product or service we’re consuming!!!in point of fact, they are outlining multiple metrics to evaluate results, and one of the reasons that the cfp board chose arnold advertising is for their strong reputation in the advertising industry for delivering measurable results (which means both that measurable change happened, and that they create metrics to measure and affirm that change).second, to the extent that very limited branding has been done in the past, it may in fact be true that the cfp marks are rarely a factor in the decision-making process; but this is not because branding doesn’t matter, it’s because the branding hasn’t actually been done enough to have a broad reaching impact in the first place!
