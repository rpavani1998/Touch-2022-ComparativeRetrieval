i think it's because i like the taste - it's not as sweet as pepsi.
professor of the university of hong kong teaches the crm module of the master of e-commerce and internet computing since 2004.
an experience process like purchasing at a retail store or buying online can hardly be conducted in an fmri on a massive scale.
pepsi developed the campaign to tell an interesting story.
in these televised spots, consumers were asked to pick the soft drink they liked better, without knowing whether the cola they tasted was coke or pepsi.
the other barrier is the un-natural testing environment.
recently, i conducted similar taste tests without using an mri.
about the author mr. sampson lee the founder of g-cem, has invented the u.s. patent-pending branded customer experience management method.
an experience process like purchasing at a retail store or buying online can hardly be conducted in an fmri on a massive scale.
neuromarketing nearly 30 years later, in the summer of 2003, neuroscientist read montague conducted this classic taste test with a fmri (functional magnetic resonance imaging) machine, which tracks blood flow to different regions of the brain.
his subjects took the pepsi challenge and montague watched their neural activity.
yet, when subjects were told which brand they were drinking, their neural activity demonstrated that three-fourths favored coke.
their choices in the blind taste test are not consistent with their choices in the open taste test.
from one-fourth to one-half of students did not respond consistently to the blind and open taste tests.
he applies modern psychology and human behavior disciplines to business practices to create effective customer experiences for today's business organizations.
he provides training and consulting to fortune 500 companies and local conglomerates and deploys x-voc customer experience research in developing multiple touch-points experience process model and total customer experience evaluation (tce).
the moving-image mri rents for $1,000 an hour at emory university in atlanta so a single experiment, including at least 12 subjects, can cost $50,000.
as results came in, it became apparent - pepsi tasted better than coke - 57% of testers chose pepsi and only 43% chose coke.
neuromarketing, the study of how the brain responds to brands and advertising, is getting more and more attention.
in shopping malls, grocery stores and other public locations, pepsi conducted blind taste tests.

it seems like a perfect solution to measure the emotional response to products or brands.
i tested my students at universities in china, hong kong, singapore, the netherlands, france, and australia, undergraduates, graduate students, and working adults with ages ranging from early 20s to late 40s.
only very large companies like general motors or coca cola can afford the expense.
in 1972, "exclusive" drinkers, those who drank over coke and those who drank only pepsi, made up 18% (coke) and 4% (pepsi) of the soft drink population.

scanning neural activity in an mri is far removed from the actual experience environment.
in the blind taste test, the blood flow showed half the subjects preferred coke and half preferred pepsi.

not only does neuromarketing eliminate self-reporting bias, it also removes consumers' inability to articulate differences between conscious and unconscious thoughts.

its practitioners believe neuromarketing is more effective than other measurement techniques because the information it provides comes directly from consumers' brains and is not affected by participant bias.

pepsi developed the campaign to tell an interesting story.
while i do believe neuromarketing will break through these barriers one day, that day may be a long way off.
this was quantitative proof that brand affects customers' choices.
