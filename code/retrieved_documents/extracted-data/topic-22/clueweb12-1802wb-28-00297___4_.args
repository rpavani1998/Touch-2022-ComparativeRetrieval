while new coke did very well against pepsi during taste tests, it failed to make a positive impression in the arena where most consumers interact with their cola and in the amounts that they drink their cola.but understanding how snap judgements are made can help us to understand the gulf between designer and design client and perhaps lead us to better ideas in our process that help us to get feedback that is truly helpful in creating better, more effective design solutions.it particularly speaks to how clients react to our work as well as to us, personally.so they must make snap judgements based on artificial criteria and in atypical settings that can send us into the wrong direction and lead to faulty solutions.unlike regular coke, new coke handily beat competitor pepsi in blind taste tests by a wide margin.those of us old enough to remember, know that new coke had it's origins in the rise of pepsi as a solid #2 competitor to perennial soft drink king, coke.this set off a panic which led coke to tamper with it's #1 selling formula and come up with a new one.in pepsi's ads (as well as private blind tests conducted by coke) a majority of consumers tested chose pepsi.of course, consumers don't sip cola out of small cups, they drink it by the glass, can, bottle or cup.but they are not interacting with our design the way they would normally, just as consumers in the "pepsi challenge" were not interacting with coke and pepsi the way they would normally.what it does is help us to understand how/why humans make snap judgements in the blink of an eye.on the other hand, you could receive a lesser meal served to you by a friendly staff who remember you and greet you warmly every time you come and think it's the best meal you ever had.by all scientific reasoning, new coke should have been a hands down success.to appeal to consumers who onlysipped the cola in small amounts.we craft designs and initial comps that are built to push clients into a specific design direction and hopefully pick one design over a variety of others we provide for them.
