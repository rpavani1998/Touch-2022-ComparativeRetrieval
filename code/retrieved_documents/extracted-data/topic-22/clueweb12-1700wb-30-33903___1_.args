pepsi seemed to be more interested in social media for social media’s sake rather than dedicated to a specific cause and serving as a catalyst for building a community of fans who also supported it.there were charges, in fact, of cheating on the part of some charitable entities in order to extort funds from pepsi.pepsi used social media (primarily facebook) to elicit suggestions, to “crowd source” the causes (have fans and friends vote on them), and to report news developments.what gathered a lot of media attention for pepsi wasn’t so much the program itself, but the fact that pepsi was pulling back in its traditional media spending in order to fund this program.by partnering with wwf, coke also aligned itself with a an organization which is beyond reproach, giving the program more legitimacy.many were geographically limited, so the pepsi community as a whole would not benefit or see the results.what’s more, when you see someone drinking a coke from a polar bear can, you immediately identify him as a fellow arctic preservationist.an annual donation of just $500,000 for an organization that has annual sales in the billions is less than a drop in the bucket.as you may recall, pepsi was one of the first big-name marketers to aggressively go “all-in” in a social media sense, with its much talked-about “pepsi refresh project.”many social media naysayers were quick to blame this slide on pepsi’s move from mass media to social media.specifically, i take pepsi to task for three key reasons: the focus was more on the “crowd sourcing” part of the program than in the good works themselves.specifically, i take pepsi to task for three key reasons: - the focus was more on the “crowd sourcing” part of the program than in the good works themselves.chances are, coke is spending at least 20 times that amount in paid media promoting this campaign alone.while i, for one, don’t think pepsi’s descent in the cola wars was due to the fact that it didn’t run a couple of super bowl spots (more on that inthis post), i do think the marketer dropped the ball when it came to defining and managing the “pepsi refresh” program.social media is most effective when it is used to amplify a strategy, not become one.
