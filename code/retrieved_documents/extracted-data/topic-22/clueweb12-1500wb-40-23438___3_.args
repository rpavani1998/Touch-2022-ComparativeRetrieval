coke simply has better products, and coca cola, co.'s superiority over pepsico with respect to their flagship colas is substantially comparable to the superiority the 1927 yankees would have over the little league team i played on when was 11.this is about an incredibly big bag of cash, and we hope coke is offering the same deal to the rest of its customers.it is for this reason that i largely avoid the pizza hut, kentucky fried chicken, taco bell triumvirate, all formerly owned by pepsico, inc., and still selling that inferior product." i'm sure subway got a good deal from coke, but i wouldn't say it's inconceivable this decision was made on product quality as well.on monday, motley fool writer rex moore reported the results of a highly scientific blind taste test atfool headquarters between vanilla coke and pepsi vanilla.if the waiter/waitress asks me, "is pepsi ok?," i make it a point to give a disappointing look, sometimes settling for water.if the answer is the latter, then the food simply must beoutstanding, so that i'm willing to put up with pepsi.the wall street journal reports (sub. req'd) that subway is switching its fountain business from pepsi to coke.if i go somewhere i don't know what they sell, i order a coke.according to the article, subway has more u.s. and canadian restaurants than mcdonald's, which i was unaware of.in sum, i'd like to say congratulations to subway.
