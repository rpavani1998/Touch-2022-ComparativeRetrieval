pepsi holds about 30% of the fountain drink market.
on top of that, the price is different is more then half the invoices that are left behind by the driver.
pepsi is more popular around the world but in the us, coke is taking advantage of being number one which is awfully painful for vendors.
"i hate to disappoint you, and i know you will be disappointed, but i have to ask if pepsi is okay since we don't sell the product you asked for."
i have two restaurants and everything single day, i think about somehow getting rid of these idiots who can't do simple things like take your order and deliver it.
i repeatedly forget they don't carry coke products, and when i hear the pepsi question, i just wince and say, "no thanks, i'll have iced tea."

this is because they know from experience only a third of you want pepsi in the first place.
by only choosing to serve pepsi, a restaurant is making itself and the supplier happy, but wholly ignoring the satisfaction of its patrons, the people who keep the restaurant in business to begin with.
