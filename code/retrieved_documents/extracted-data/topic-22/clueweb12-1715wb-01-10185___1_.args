and even if the better world shopping guide is far from complete, it still does a great service to socially responsible shoppers.the book systematically ranks every type of company from airlines to banks to cereal manufacturers on an a-to-f scale, and presents the information in an easy-to-follow, shopping-friendly format.i can now safely say which is the better beverage from a social and environmental responsibility standpoint (never mind that both of them rot away our kidneys in equal measure).the book is an invaluable resource for anyone concerned about the consequences of his or her everyday buying decisions, whether from the perspectives of peak oil or climate change, animal testing, toxic waste dumping, child labor or corporate accounting scandals, to name just a few of the issues.“a” companies, he writes, often “were created specifically to provide socially and environmentally responsible options for consumers,” while “f” companies “are actively participating in the rapid destruction of the planet and the exploitation of human beings.”another nice feature of the book is the product category index located at the back, which is intended to help readers find items that they may have missed the first time through.if product x is certified fair trade or organic, it gets an a or a b plus, respectively.it doesn’t cover 100 percent of the companies and products that are out there, but it does nail quite a large percentage of them.the book contains plenty of interesting informational tidbits for peak oil readers.if you know nothing at all about the company, assign it a c. local credit unions automatically receive a b; organic and local beer breweries get an a minus; and farmers markets, food co-ops and local bakeries or vineyards all tie with a resounding a plus.jones freely admits that his guide is “far from complete,” and that readers will likely come across companies and brands in their everyday dealings that receive no mention in the book.indeed, the present reviewer can name several such companies right offhand: top food & drug, first mutual bank, black bear diner, big boy restaurants, taco time andtaco del mar, to name just a few.as for corporate villains, you’ll find the usual array of big box stores, oil companies, pharmaceutical manufacturers and fast food restaurants—as well as a few surprise entries that just might change the way you shop for everything from noodle soup to computer software.jones, a ph.d. in sociology, wrote the book after doing years of research on corporate behavior—drawing on resources like the better business bureau, the center for public integrity and the environmental protection agency—compiling the data into an extensive database and then distilling these data down into a report card-style grade for each business or product.if company y produces clothing or shoes, it automatically falls into the d or f category.
