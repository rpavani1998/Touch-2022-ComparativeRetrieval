pepsi or coke, if you’re reading this, you’re welcome.
there are several researchers who study cephalopod behavior and cognition who are generally pretty friendly, and besides thatentire societies of researchers devoted to scientificially studying claims of the “supernatural”.
that is, until she got to the point in the article where the cnn reporter asks an “expert” the critical question: “can an octopus really be psychic?”
reply let me blow your mind, mike.
it turns out that communicating with animals in a reproducible and useful way is much more difficult than being paid money to look at a digital image and coming up with a diagnosis and prognosis based on the feeling you get from the image.
in that moment a reconnection was established and michelle then set out to bridge the gap between animal and human communication.
after reading this section, if she had any sort of head on her shoulders,  our inquisitive internet reader would (hopefully) be aghast, and a bit miffed  that a cnn report would be such a lousy source of information.
however, the (sometimes distressingly) wide pool of information that is the internet has not disappointed me.

you might have guessed  what her take would be.
why care about this women and her claims about communications with animals?
as for as paul’s ability to predict a football result,  childerley claims the octopus is perfectly aware of what he is being asked.
a blossoming cephalopod enthusiast who is curious about paul can pick from literally millions of sources of information to hear about this phenomenon, and if she’s smart, will try to pick one that seems credible.

it seems one will never go broke by underestimating general common sense.

reply thanks for the info!
d student in a field totally unrelated to cephalopods - i just love to learn about them!
now, paul the psychic octopus will finally answer, once and for all, which is better”.
you would think anyone with two brain cells to rub together for a spark would be able to spot delusion as serious as this, but there you go.
and yes, why anyone in the world takes childerly seriously is utterly beyond me.
reply there’s lots of brands it could work for.
it wasn’t until  2006 that michelle became aware of her ability once again when the dog of a man  selling the big issue suddenly spoke to her.
after jason was taken away at the age of twelve, michelle shut down her intuitive awareness for many years to come.
in addition, claims like hers serve to distract from and give a bad name to  people who are trying to work on the sciences of animal communication and  animal-human communication.
here’s a way to make millions of dollars with paul the psychic octopus.
eximius theme by dkszone.net
her qualifications include thinking that she could  talk to her pet dog as a child (who didn’t, though?), as is proclaimed on  her“about” page: michelle felt since the age of seven that she was aware of a special  connection with her dog jason, her soul mate throughout her childhood.
since i try to keep this blog firmly focused on cephalopods, i was at first antsy that i would not find anything to write about.
“he’s picking up on what everyone around him is thinking,” she said.
for one thing, she’s selling these claims to people as a sort of  veterinary care, taking money both from misled pet owners and from legitimate  practitioners (this is not to say she might not use some legitimate animal  training procedures in some of her work, but she will also accept 30 pounds to  do an “animal readings/consultations by an emailed or posted  photograph”, which means that you send her some money and a picture of  your pet, and she will tell you what’s wrong with your pet’s  emotional/psychic life.
“he knows there are two boxes which represent two sides, so he’s basically tuned in to the more positive team at the moment he makes his choice.”
instead, he decided to interview michelle childerley (see herpersonal homepage ), a self-proclaimed “animal communication expert pet psychic & behaviour specialist.”
but their reporter  didn’t pick anybody who was an expert in the science and psychology  behind “parapsychological” phenomena or an expert on cephalopods.
we’re left wondering whether he really took ms.  childerley’s comments seriously, or if he’s just kind of bad at  finding relevant people to interview.
fromthe cnn article: michelle childerley, who describes herself as an animal communications expert, told cnn that all animals — as well as humans — possess a psychic ability, with telepathy the main way of communicating among many species.
“he knows there are two boxes which represent two sides, so  he’s basically tuned in to the more positive team at the moment he makes  his choice.”
she says dogs can often sense what an owner wants before they vocalize  it.
sending strange people to do stories is nothing new.
the vendors have to sign a pledge to stay clean and sober, in return they get most of the cover price of what they sell & help finding long-term housing.
a google search for  “paul the octopus” (the exact phrase) turns up 5.5 million results.

she would find some informative and  entertaining quips, and would mostly get the facts straight.

(as an aside: what is “the big issue”?
her qualifications include thinking that she could talk to her pet dog as a child (who didn’t, though?), as is proclaimed on her“about” page: michelle felt since the age of seven that she was aware of a special connection with her dog jason, her soul mate throughout her childhood.
she always knew exactly what jason was thinking and feeling and would enjoy endless conversations.
the reporter might have redeemed the article if he’d presented any  other opinions on the topic, or any indication that readers might want take  this “expert’s” testimony with a grain of salt.
pet psychics (especially those who bill themselves with sciencey-sounding titles like “animal communications expert”) give a bad name to the scientists who are working hard to actually understand and explain animal communication and cognition.
they’re one of the big names in news, globally.
ford vs. chevy (paul could click the auto-start up button on the keys), kelloggs vs. general mills, etc.
before i go on, let me say that there are any number of highly qualified  people who could of answered this question.
cnn is supposed to be credible, right?
there are several researchers who  study cephalopod behavior and cognition who are generally pretty friendly, and  besides thatentire societies of researchers devoted to scientificially studying  claims of the “supernatural”.
to give credit and links where they are due, i first heard about this story at boing boing, where maggie koerth-baker had the right reaction to it: a hearty facepalm.

on the other is a can of pepsi.

so what did ms. childerley have to say about paul?
but how else could he know who would win the world cup?reply cnn sent a camera crew on a shark cruise i was on.

you’ve all heard about paul the octopus by now.
apparently it’s not distributed in the us, and so i had no idea.

in it, paul is in a tank.

the narrator says “the question of coke vs. pepsi has been debated for decades.
