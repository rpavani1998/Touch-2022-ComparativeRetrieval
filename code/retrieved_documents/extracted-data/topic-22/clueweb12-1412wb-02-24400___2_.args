not only does neuromarketing eliminate self-reporting bias, it also removes consumers' inability to articulate differences between conscious and unconscious thoughts.from one-fourth to one-half of students did not respond consistently to the blind and open taste tests.this was quantitative proof that brand affects customers' choices.its practitioners believe neuromarketing is more effective than other measurement techniques because the information it provides comes directly from consumers' brains and is not affected by participant bias.in these televised spots, consumers were asked to pick the soft drink they liked better, without knowing whether the cola they tasted was coke or pepsi.in the blind taste test, the blood flow showed half the subjects preferred coke and half preferred pepsi.in 1972, "exclusive" drinkers, those who drank over coke and those who drank only pepsi, made up 18% (coke) and 4% (pepsi) of the soft drink population.as results came in, it became apparent - pepsi tasted better than coke - 57% of testers chose pepsi and only 43% chose coke.yet, when subjects were told which brand they were drinking, their neural activity demonstrated that three-fourths favored coke.in shopping malls, grocery stores and other public locations, pepsi conducted blind taste tests.neuromarketing nearly 30 years later, in the summer of 2003, neuroscientist read montague conducted this classic taste test with a fmri (functional magnetic resonance imaging) machine, which tracks blood flow to different regions of the brain.neuromarketing, the study of how the brain responds to brands and advertising, is getting more and more attention.only very large companies like general motors or coca cola can afford the expense.their choices in the blind taste test are not consistent with their choices in the open taste test.the moving-image mri rents for $1,000 an hour at emory university in atlanta so a single experiment, including at least 12 subjects, can cost $50,000.
