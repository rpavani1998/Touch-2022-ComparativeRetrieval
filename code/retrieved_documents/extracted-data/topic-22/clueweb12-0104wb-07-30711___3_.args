impact investing offers a new way to bring capital to improving lives and a new way for people to connect with each other based on mutual benefit.traditional philanthropy and government programs, while critical to improving the lives of the poor, can never by themselves meet all the needs of disadvantaged communities.on the other hand, philanthropy is essential to providing funding for the arts, job and literacy training, pregnancy prevention, eldercare, and similar programs which will never be supported by the market alone.i look forward to the day when we stop viewing philanthropy and impact investing as a coke-or-pepsi choice and start to see them for what they are: natural allies in the struggle to make the world a better place for all of us to live, work, raise our families, and perhaps have a little fun.in fact, in many cases, we see the clear benefit in having both, working in partnership.one other thing philanthropy can do is to help jump-start investment (including the impact investing movement).to oversimplify, investment capital can help build things like small businesses, affordable housing, community health clinics, senior centers, schools, water systems in the developing world, etc.as a nonprofit, however, we recognize and value the vital role that philanthropy plays even within the impact investing sector, for things like risk capital and technical assistance for social entrepreneurs.every day at st. john’s more than 1,000 hungry brooklyn children, families, and individuals receive nutritious meals.calvert social investment foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, offers the community investment note, which is subject to certain risks, is not a mutual fund, is not fdic or sipc insured, and should not be confused with any calvert group-sponsored investment product.at calvert foundation, our aim is to transform investment culture so that every investor becomes an impact investor.even a casual reader of the commentary around impact investing and philanthropy will note that much of the discussion is centered on which is better.using a loan to fund st. john’s space needs meant that more philanthropy was available to provide services to the recipients of the meals, like naishaune spencer (pictured right with his daughter).“with the help of st. john’s bread & life, loving family and friends, and sheer dedication, i was able to go back to school, get a great job, have a steady income and, most significantly, get my first apartment.”at st. john’s, naishaune receives nutritional counseling, health and hygiene products, and social services such as workforce development, literacy training, psychiatric services, and substance-abuse counseling.
