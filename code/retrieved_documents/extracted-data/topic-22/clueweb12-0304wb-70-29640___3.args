however, although a small cup of a sweeter drink may taste better at the time, that doesn’t necessarily mean that a 12 ounce ‘sweeter’ drink would be preferred.
the group that was conducting the 'test' i saw were clearly weighting the results in pepsi's favor, whether they were instructed to or not.
posted @ wednesday, september 28, 2011 4:09 pm byjohn grafton very good post, i was really searching for this topic as i wanted this topic to understand completely and it is also very rare in internet that is why it was very difficult to understand thank you for sharing this.
too much of a sweet thing might not be what coke drinkers wanted.
coke drinkers were loyal the brand, not just to the taste.

the mistake made was treating coke as any other brand and not as a true american icon.
the lip-sticking blog hubspot blog the marketing dialog forwards the conversation between marketing research and marketing with the purpose of enhancing and strengthening the industry.
with so many dollars at stake in the soda category, it isn’t a surprise that research methodologies are occasionally skewed.
they were right since coke had substituted cane sugar in the original formula for high-fructose corn syrup, which gives the drink a different taste (but is less expensive for the company to use in manufacturing the product.)
the taste tests were conducted offering respondents a choice between a small cup of regular coke, a small cup of a sweeter formula of coke and a small cup of pepsi that resulted in the roll-out of new coke.
without going into details, i found the research to be properly conducted including the tricky issue of sample selection.
even then, however, consumers were suspicious of coke and didn’t think classic tasted like the original recipe.
regard share market posted @ thursday, october 13, 2011 1:22 am byshare market not all the time no one can win the match of stock market trade , humans are bounded with emotions and personal affairs that makes them to take wrong decisions at right time even though they are masters of trade.
i got that ‘deer caught in the headlights’ look that told me she had never heard of new coke, nor probably had anyone in her generation since this all happened in the mid-80’s.
pepsi has not recovered.
i didn't design or conduct the research.
so for you who are old enough to remember, take a trip down memory lane with me as i distill the new coke experience, with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, for the younger researchers.
respondents weren’t given cold pepsi vs. luke warm flat coke.
in the taste-test challenges, pepsi usually won but not for the right reasons.

i will definately be coming back here more often.
although market research showed that 80 percent of the american public was aware of the change within days and the company’s stock went up after the announcement, that wasn’t necessarily a good thing.
choosing the right indicator or analyzing software blended with human aspect gives better results.
the primary difference in the ‘original’ versus the current formulations is that the ‘retro’ versions use sugar, not corn syrup as the sweetener.
nonetheless, coke marketers’ faith in their taste tests was so strong, since the sweeter mixture beat both pepsi and ‘regular’ coke, new coke was introduced in 1985 to replace the original drink formula.
the coke marketers finally concluded was that it hadvastly underestimated the size of the public who would be alienated by the switch, even when introduced to a new product they perceived was preferred.
in the taste-test challenges, pepsi usually won but not for the right reasons.
markets dramatically change they their flow and no one exactly produce or expect 100% from their profits .
respondents were offered a cold, fresh cup of pepsi next to a lukewarm, flat cup of coke.

don keough said it was a great marketing gambit, but he was not smart enough to actually plan it.
and i totally agree with your last statement - especially in the south, coke was the generic name for any soda when i was growing up, which usually was a coca-cola, and maybe new coke would have succeeded if they had 'prepped' consumers beforehand, but as you point out, they completely ignored the 'heritage' of coke and its deep connection with consumers before surprising them - bad marketing!.
you forgot to comment on the huge egos involved in the decision, including the surge man.
what coke failed to anticipate was the visceral connection consumers felt to the product they grew up with.
pepsi won the challenge because it is (was) slightly sweeter.
to fire someone would be admitting that coke made a mistake - and thed'll never admit to that.
and coke, in its own taste tests found that in brand unidentified taste tests, coke users preferred a sweeter formulation than their “classic” coke – so coke changed the formula and the name.

wish i could add to the conversation and bring a bit more to the table, but am just taking in as much info as i can at the moment.

based on many, many focus groups and taste tests, coke concluded that the answer was solely the taste of the product.

this month’s subject came from a very hard dose of reality i encountered last week when i was speaking with a junior member of our staff and mentioned new coke.

in a strange twist, however, if you look at the soda shelves these days, you will see ‘retro’ soda formulations, such as the ‘original’ mountain dew and ‘original’ pepsi being offered to consumers.
the public’s reaction to new coke – or more accurately to the discontinuation of the original coke formula - was sudden and severe.
great companies make their own luck.

though people were addicted of coke but what the manufacturers forgot is " its not only the name of coke which drived people mad but they were addicted of its origenal taste" so the research was both faulty and not thorough enough!
