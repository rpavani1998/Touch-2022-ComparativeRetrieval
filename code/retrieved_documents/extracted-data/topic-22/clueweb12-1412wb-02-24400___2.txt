an experience process like purchasing at a retail store or buying online can hardly be conducted in an fmri on a massive scale.

pepsi  developed the campaign to tell an interesting story.
in these televised spots, consumers were asked to pick the  soft drink they liked better, without knowing whether the cola they tasted was  coke or pepsi.
the other barrier is the un-natural testing environment.
recently, i conducted similar taste tests without using an mri.
you probably remember a classic ad campaign of the early 1908s, "the pepsi challenge."

neuromarketing nearly 30 years later, in the summer of 2003, neuroscientist read  montague conducted this classic taste test with a fmri (functional magnetic  resonance imaging) machine, which tracks blood flow to different regions of the  brain.
by the early 1980s, those who drank exclusively coke dropped to 12% and those who drank exclusively pepsi had increased to 11% of the soft drink population.
he also sits on the advisory council of customerthink.com - the world's largest customer management community serving 300,000+ members.
his subjects took the pepsi challenge and montague watched their neural  activity.
yet, when subjects were told which  brand they were drinking, their neural activity demonstrated that three-fourths  favored coke.
their choices in  the blind taste test are not consistent with their choices in the open taste  test.
from one-fourth to one-half of students did not respond consistently to the blind and open taste tests.
there are some problems, however.

the moving-image mri rents for $1,000 an hour at emory university in atlanta so a single experiment, including at least 12 subjects, can cost $50,000.
as results came in, it became apparent - pepsi tasted better  than coke - 57% of testers chose pepsi and only 43% chose coke.
neuromarketing, the study of how the brain responds to brands and  advertising, is getting more and more attention.

how much does "taste" really matter?
in  shopping malls, grocery stores and other public locations, pepsi conducted  blind taste tests.
it's hardly likely to be adopted by many  companies.

even though some students identified themselves as coke or pepsi fans, they confused the taste of coke and pepsi, choosing one as the best-tasting in the blind test and the other in the open test both the mri scanning and my students' taste tests suggest that people perceive and react differently when they know which brand they are consuming.
it seems like a perfect  solution to measure the emotional response to products or brands.
i tested my students at universities in china, hong kong,  singapore, the netherlands, france, and australia, undergraduates, graduate  students, and working adults with ages ranging from early 20s to late 40s.
only very large companies like general motors or coca cola can afford the expense.
in 1972, "exclusive" drinkers, those who drank over coke and those who drank only pepsi, made up 18% (coke) and 4% (pepsi) of the soft drink population.
each  student performed two taste tests - one was a blind taste test, in the other i  told them which cup contained coke and which contained pepsi.
as results came in, it became apparent - pepsi tasted better than coke - 57% of testers chose pepsi and only 43% chose coke.

scanning neural activity in an mri is far removed from the actual experience environment.
in the blind taste test, the blood flow showed half the subjects  preferred coke and half preferred pepsi.

not only does neuromarketing eliminate  self-reporting bias, it also removes consumers' inability to articulate  differences between conscious and unconscious thoughts.
