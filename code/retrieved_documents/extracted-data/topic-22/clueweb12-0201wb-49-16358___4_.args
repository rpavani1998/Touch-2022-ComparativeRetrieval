such tools help to stimulate word-of-mouth advertising, which is more effective than general advertising.therefore, word-of-mouth, referrals, and networking systems are not only important because they create an awareness of your business (or for creating traffic, in the online world), but also important to the degree to which third party marketing indirectly communicates your superiority and the value of the products or services you offer.in addition, those who get to know you or know about you through third party referrals grant you a higher level of confidence, credibility, and loyalty.for along with communicating your existence to the world, word-of-mouth advertising helps to cast that aura of leadership and superiority.in fact, referral traffic generators are key ingredients of online success.when a person is introduced to cola for the first time, he or she is often told to try coke.but according to ries, taste tests conducted by both coke and pepsi reveal that pepsi is the better tasting brand.in other words, if you tell people you're the best, that you're the leader in your field, or that your product is the best solution to their needs, your self-serving promotional bias can be instantly recognized.and that perception is often molded by what they are told and by what others do, not by what is fact or by what is being advertised.networking systems, for example, include strategic marketing alliances, joint ventures, and affiliate programs.they say that the key to marketing success in the offline world is "location, location, location."and, unlike the more traditional traffic generators such as banners and search engines, these specific tools are much more effective since they are used by third parties and not by the original advertiser.but creating specific systems and using specific tools that will leverage the spreading of that message helps to multiply your marketing punch exponentially.coke was the first cola "in the mind" of the marketplace and thus the one most talked about, even to this day.they usually buy the leader (or what they perceive as being the best).
