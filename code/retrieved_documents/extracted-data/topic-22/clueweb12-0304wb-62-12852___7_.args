in canada, the plastic contour bottles still provide an edge in marketing, particularly among spontaneous buyers.coke still uses the famous 'contour-bottle' image on its advertising and promotional material because it's simply too precious an icon to lose.he keeps his hand in the 'refillable-returnable' business because it continues to turn a small profit in his market, which includes a good chunk of northern and eastern saskatchewan in addition to the city of prince albert.and so does coke, which spent 'an inordinate amount of money' in canada creating and accommodating the production of plastic bottles, in the familiar contour shape.however, a few prince albert confectioneries do stock bottled coke in their modern, glass-walled refrigerators.a few small companies in the u.s. still handle bottled coke.a 300-ml (10 oz) bottle of coke sells for only 75 cents.there, the bottles are generic and labelled, and it's the price point that counts.but hauser says that even if a bottle 'float' came up for sale south of the border, it would be expensive to ship it to prince albert and the old bottles would have a limited life span.they couldn't keep enough product in the stores." not only were the kids fascinated with the bottles, says hauser, they were enthralled by the bottle cap."their production is being done in large plants in places like calgary and winnipeg, who haven't done returnables for 15 years already."most of hauser's 'bottle' accounts are places like ben darchuk's shop, small businesses with vending machines intended primarily for use by staff."kids from schools come in here just to buy pop.so did a lot of other businesses and stores in north america.there's no incentive for the business owner to switch to a more expensive can vender.
