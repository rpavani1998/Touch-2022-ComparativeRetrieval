advertising and marketing can build specific experiences and connections with the differnt target groups, while this icon stands strong and grows more valuable.having been there in the 90's, i can tell you the reason a coke package can end up with a million appendages is because the brand marketing mba's spend millions of hours writing brand strategies that talk about effervescence and refreshment and believe that each package should communicate everything!i suspect, although i don't have the data to back this up, that a potential drinker is likely to have a more positive appreciation for a can which supports that natural process and shows the user that the temperature of the coke is perfect rather than a fake set of bubbles or condensation or a design which is so busy it does not lend itself to showing off this aspect of the soda drinking experience.that simple intervention has the ability to de-dramatize the can, to give it a more human and accessible feeling.by recognizing that the majority of american consumers know this product so well, emphasizing refreshment and water condensation and fizziness via the can graphics is simply unnecessary.nice to see that coke had the confidence to proudly show it's brand maturity which has lasted so many years.(kind of like the music industry trends... all the young ppl of each generation find what we grew up with and considered 'normal' to be all retro and cool, so by going back to a clean design, it also becomes a new canvas for the next generation of designers and consumers to build upon... 3.it has also clearly streamlines the fact that it's the base flavour leaving the "cherry and vanilla etc" flavours to have something that differs from the original.. p.s love those pepsi cans above, it's a real shame they don't use themsince new coke is no longer produced, the word "classic" on its product serves only as a reminder of its marketing blunder.i would say to the couple nay-sayers here that the beauty of this design is that it allows people young an old and from each sub-culture to endow their own feelings and meaning to this iconic brand.but corey is right, coke remains coke and its millions, its need to please all worldwide and i'm not ever expecting anything brilliant to come from them anyway.maybe coke is conceding the african-american audience to pepsi with this, or maybe not screaming above the energy drink cans with aggressive colors and logos is going to hurt their market share with teenagers.it is truly classic, and because of coke's history, it will always be a good design to fall back on.yes, coke will probably save money on printing costs, though i find it hard to believe they would go to this aesthetic solely for that purpose (but i'm just a naive student).the larger personality aspects of the brand are communicated through other marketing channels, of which packaging is just one.the diet soft drink category has suffered.
