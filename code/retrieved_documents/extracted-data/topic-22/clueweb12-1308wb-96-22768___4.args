in other words – at least as far as the research is concerned – pepsi actually “tastes” better than coke, but doesn’t taste as good as coke plus coke’s brand value (or viewed another way,coke has a stronger brand than pepsi and as a result influences people's opinions of which soda tastes better - good thing they have a strong branding campaign!).
in more recent research replicating these results, scientists have actually shown using neurological imaging scans that the brain actually responds differently to a blind-taste-test version of coke, than a version of coke where the subject sees and knows that it’s coke.
in point of fact, they are outlining multiple metrics to evaluate results, and one of the reasons that the cfp board chose arnold advertising is for their strong reputation in the advertising industry for delivering measurable results (which means both that measurable change happened, and that they create metrics to measure and affirm that change).

in this context,no one who consumed coke in the taste test ever stated “i think the pepsi tastes better, but i prefer coke because i just think it’s a better brand.”
so not only does the impact of a solid brand have an incredible impact – it doesn’t just affect our choice, it actually changes the experienceitself to be more positive when we can associate a good brand with the product or service we’re consuming!!!
they choose to work with me because of my individual trustworthiness, credibility, and ability to deliver the guidance they need.
nonetheless, if consumers drink coke but don’t know it’s coke – or worse, see it presented as some never-heard-of “no name” cola drink – they prefer pepsi instead.
branding is an often misunderstood phenomenon; in part, i think that’s because we as financial planners are not trained in marketing, but more significantly i think it’s because, as research on branding itself ironically shows, we are often not even aware of the impact that branding is actually having on our own decision-making process.
nonetheless, if consumers drink coke but don’t know it’s coke – or worse, see it presented as some never-heard-of “no name” cola drink – they prefer pepsi instead.
yet as the research shows, consumersdid choose coke in large part because of its brand, and actually enjoyed the taste of coke more as a result.
to paraphrase it, the assertion was “i have never had a client state that they chose to work with me because of my cfp certification.

but the board of directors, and cfp board staff, have been very clear that there is a huge focus on delivering measurable results.
in this context,no one who consumed coke in the taste test ever stated “i think the pepsi tastes better, but i prefer coke because i just think it’s a better brand.”
but again, they were completely unaware of the impact that branding was having on them.
nonetheless, the impact is there, and it’s significant.
but i think to also imply that people don’t find the cfp marks relevant in the decision-making process – especially because they don’t ask questions about the cfp marks or state that they were a factor in initial client meetings – is to ignore the powerful reality that is “branding.”
if they didn’t know which was coke and which was pepsi, though, they chose pepsi.

the first is that, even if people are being affected by what limited branding exists already with respect to the cfp marks, they are almost certainly unaware that the cfp marks influenced their decision (and to say the least, will not likelysay that the cfp marks were a factor in making the choice).
we would never do this with our clients' money yet we are doing it with ours.
yet as the research shows, consumersdid choose coke in large part because of its brand, and actually enjoyed the taste of coke more as a result.
second, to the extent that very limited branding has been done in the past, it may in fact be true that the cfp marks are rarely a factor in the decision-making process; but this is not because branding doesn’t matter, it’s because the branding hasn’t actually been done enough to have a broad reaching impact in the first place!

certainly, i won’t deny that the ability to communicate effectively with prospective clients and to inculcate a trust relationship is crucial to an individual’s decision-making process about who to work with for financial guidance.
and the fact that the typical planner experience suggests the cfp marks are not a part of the client decision-making process are not necessarily a contradiction of this, since people are generally unaware of the impact that branding has on their own decisions, and in reality there really isn’t very much branding for the cfp marks in the eyes of the public in the first place.
in other words, the research further shows that until there is awareness, the cfp marks are not a factor; but once there is awareness, the cfp marks become an important (albeit still not the only) conscious factor in choosing an advisor, not to mention any subconscious branding impact.
they choose to work with me because of my individual trustworthiness, credibility, and ability to deliver the guidance they need.
after taking up the issue at their board meeting yesterday, the cfp board officially announced this morning that the 80% fee increase for cfp certificants to support a public awareness campaign for the cfp marks has been approved.
i don't believe they will be able to create a powerful enough "brand" to justify the cost.

in more recent research replicating these results, scientists have actually shown using neurological imaging scans that the brain actually responds differently to a blind-taste-test version of coke, than a version of coke where the subject sees and knows that it’s coke.
in essence, the coke brand – and the way our brain processes it – is so powerful, that we literally, biochemically and physiologically, enjoy coke more when we can see and associate the coke brand with the beverage that we are drinking.
so not only does the impact of a solid brand have an incredible impact – it doesn’t just affect our choice, it actually changes the experienceitself to be more positive when we can associate a good brand with the product or service we’re consuming!!!
so the bottom line is that the research – both with respect to branding overall, and the value of the marks in particular given their rigor – indicates that public awareness of the requirements for cfp certification and branding of the cfp marks really does have value, at least to the extent that the marketing/advertising efforts themselves are delivered properly and effectively.
granted, they are still sorting out some of the exact metrics details that will be used, because the reality is that the campaign itself is still in the design phases.
in these situations we write a blank check to a marketing firm with absolutely no way to track the results.
in addition, it is notable that in support of the cfp board’s own pre-research (see their extensive discussion in thiscfp board certificant connection video) in considering the public awareness initiative, they conducted significant focus-group marketing research, and their results indicated that in fact, the value and virtues of the cfp marks are so significant that consumers actuallydo state that the marks would be a material factor in their decision-making process.
in other words, the research further shows that until there is awareness, the cfp marks are not a factor; but once there is awareness, the cfp marks become an important (albeit still not the only) conscious factor in choosing an advisor, not to mention any subconscious branding impact.
however, the focus-group research showed that the marks can only be a factor if/when/once the consumer actually becomes familiar with the ethics, experience, education, and examination requirements that the marks entail.
in response, pepsi initiated the so-called “pepsi challenge” where consumers were given two unidentified soft drinks (one coke, one pepsi), were instructed to try each and report which one they liked better, and after-the-fact found out which one they had chosen.

i don't believe in brand marketing.
in the initial version, coke conducted an extensive series of taste tests where consumers were presented with a can of coke and a can of pepsi, tasted each one, and reported which one tasted better; the majority of consumers chose coke.
but again, they were completely unaware of the impact that branding was having on them.
