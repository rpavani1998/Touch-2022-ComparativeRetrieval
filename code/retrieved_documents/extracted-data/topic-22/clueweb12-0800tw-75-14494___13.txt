pepsi responded in 2009 by releasing pepsi throwback, a soda that uses its old formula and includes sugar (cane and beet) instead of hfcs.

though most tasters agreed that pepsi throwback has a sweeter  taste and regular pepsi has more of a metallic taste.

some people thought it was "naughty".
seriously, cane sugar beats hfcs for taste, hands down.
my partner will relent and occasionally drink coke if pepsi is not available though dislikes the "high acid taste" in hfcs coke.
