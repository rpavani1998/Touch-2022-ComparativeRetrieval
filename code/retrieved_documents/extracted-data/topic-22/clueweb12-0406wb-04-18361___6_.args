those who get to know you or to know about you through a third party grant you a higher level of confidence, credibility and loyalty.accordingly, word-of-mouth is not only important because it creates an awareness of your business (let alone traffic), but also it is important to the degree to which third party marketing indirectly communicates greater credibility, superiority and value of the products or services you provide.consequently, if people hear about you from other people, and not some advertisement or pitch, this social proof will create not only a certain buzzworthiness about you but also an almost instant trustworthiness.word-of-mouth is one of the most powerful lead and business generation processes there is.in other words, if you tell people you’re the best, that you’re the leader in your field, or that your product is the best solution to their needs, your self-serving promotional bias makes it all suspect.when a person is introduced to cola for the first time, they are often told to try coke.and unlike the more tradwebsional traffic generators such as ads and search engines, these specific tools are much more effective since they are used by third parties and not by the original advertiser.and that perception is often molded by what they are told and by what others do, not by what is fact or by what is being advertised.networking systems, for example, include strategic marketing alliances, joint ventures, and affiliate programs.but according to ries, taste tests reveal that pepsi is the better tasting brand.while other colas are bombarding them with marketing messages, people have heard of coke first, and most likely from other people.the second is simple: you create an application — whether it’s a video, audio, file, software, document, etc – that people can pass around, and thus proliferates the knowledge of your existence on the web through other people’s efforts.in essence, to expand your reach, you need to be in as many places as possible, talked about by as many people as possible and be in front of as many eyeballs as possible.that said, there are ways to use systems that will leverage the spreading of that message, on the other hand, which helps to multiply your marketing punch.they usually buy the leader (or what they perceive as being the best).
