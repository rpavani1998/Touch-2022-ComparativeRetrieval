by only choosing to serve pepsi, a restaurant is making itself and the supplier happy, but wholly ignoring the satisfaction of its patrons, the people who keep the restaurant in business to begin with.as a restaurant owner, you choose pepsi or coke products—in doing so, you get the perks offered by one supplier, spend less on product, take fewer deliveries.pepsi is more popular around the world but in the us, coke is taking advantage of being number one which is awfully painful for vendors.the company puts themselves in a position of constantly disappointing the people they consider to be potential customers.if coke holds such a vast majority share of the market, they are in a position of privilege.more people will naturally order their products at a restaurant and therefore coke has the muscle to approach these places with contracts for exclusivity.if pepsi wants to increase its market share, contractual exclusivity is not the way to do it.coke has the worst customer server and are known for it throughout the restaurant industry.a good web firm will remain objective and often flat-out disagree with the assessments of its own clients because it knows web sites exist for the people that visit them, not for the people that commission—or design—them.pepsi holds about 30% of the fountain drink market.this is because they know from experience only a third of you want pepsi in the first place.pepsi on the other hand has a much better reputation and mountain due is a big big seller but their diet sodas are crap!all too often, a client and web firm will team up to launch a site that only makes the client and web firm happy, but then completely ignores the needs of the audience.pepsi's new strategy is all viral and social."i hate to disappoint you, and i know you will be disappointed, but i have to ask if pepsi is okay since we don't sell the product you asked for."
