while in vegas last week i wanted to stop by the world famous "welcome to las vegas" sign and take a photo of myself with it... ...not for any sentimental or nostalgic reason, but because it counts as a "virtual geocache" - a hobby of mine - and i was approaching my 100th find... i found out after talking to my cabbie that...
