with so many dollars at stake in the soda category, it isn’t a surprise that research methodologies are occasionally skewed.the coke marketers finally concluded was that it hadvastly underestimated the size of the public who would be alienated by the switch, even when introduced to a new product they perceived was preferred.based on many, many focus groups and taste tests, coke concluded that the answer was solely the taste of the product.the taste tests were conducted offering respondents a choice between a small cup of regular coke, a small cup of a sweeter formula of coke and a small cup of pepsi that resulted in the roll-out of new coke.they were right since coke had substituted cane sugar in the original formula for high-fructose corn syrup, which gives the drink a different taste (but is less expensive for the company to use in manufacturing the product.)nonetheless, coke marketers’ faith in their taste tests was so strong, since the sweeter mixture beat both pepsi and ‘regular’ coke, new coke was introduced in 1985 to replace the original drink formula.markets dramatically change they their flow and no one exactly produce or expect 100% from their profits .and i totally agree with your last statement - especially in the south, coke was the generic name for any soda when i was growing up, which usually was a coca-cola, and maybe new coke would have succeeded if they had 'prepped' consumers beforehand, but as you point out, they completely ignored the 'heritage' of coke and its deep connection with consumers before surprising them - bad marketing!.what coke failed to anticipate was the visceral connection consumers felt to the product they grew up with.choosing the right indicator or analyzing software blended with human aspect gives better results.the brilliance was in their recovery, leveraging the brand's short term demise by re-energizing it with new levels of loyalty.the mistake made was treating coke as any other brand and not as a true american icon.respondents were offered a cold, fresh cup of pepsi next to a lukewarm, flat cup of coke.the group that was conducting the 'test' i saw were clearly weighting the results in pepsi's favor, whether they were instructed to or not.the primary difference in the ‘original’ versus the current formulations is that the ‘retro’ versions use sugar, not corn syrup as the sweetener.
