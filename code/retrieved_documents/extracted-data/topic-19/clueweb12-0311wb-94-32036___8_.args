it's provides a formal way of saying "thanks" and helps to promote their website (in a search-engine-friendly kind of way).stk comment 05/10/08 maclover - your rude, name-calling, puctuation-less and poorly capitalized comment puts mac users in poor company and reflects badly on the entire country of india.you can take a more quantitative approach and look at system shoot-outs.this is where visitors can find out about randsco and the kimler family.i'd like to think that our menu system is easy and will work, but some people just require a site map to figure it out.randsco site map site map again, this is something that i've been wanting to do for some time and i believe that a site map is necessary to help those people out that have a hard time figuring out what is what on our site.an lastly, not as if this is the ultimate comparison, but as of 2003, the forbes 400 (richest people in the u.s.) had bill gates at #1 with a net worth of $40b and steve jobs was #49, with a net worth of $5b. while i'd love to have either balance in my bank account, bill's about 8x better off than steve.not only was their contribution unsolicited, but they didn't require any support to get it deployed.but for some reason, mac seems to hold their technology a tad too close to their chest, which is why i find this video so humorous.it's kinda like the old "meet scott and rachel" section on our pct webpage, but this "about us" section will be a stand-alone page.the red dirt emporium was one of the few companies (or people) that made an unsoliciteddonation for their commercial usage of the photo-caption zoom v3 technique.so, i made this section and (slowly) have begun populating it with some of the many people and companies that have - in some way - supported or helped randsco.the ability to run unix and windows.if you readmac vs pc, it seems that mac is the winner hands-down.it is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt.
