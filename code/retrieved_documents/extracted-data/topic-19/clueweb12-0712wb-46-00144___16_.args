a macbook makes a great windows laptop, and since you already have it it'll be more cost effective to just buy a copy of windows.as a mac is basically a reasonably well specified pc in a nice case for fifty per cent more money, it will run windows better than a low end pc.the battery has swollen, 2gb of ram is little nowadays, and a 5400rpm hdd is slow.mice: not only do the designs vary by quite a large bit between manufacturers as far as hardware implementation--some that have one smooth metallic surface that only does tap response, some that have rough textured surfaces for tactile response, to thinkpads with a nipple and touchpad and about six different ways to click and doubleclick--but it's also important to keep in mind that the mice action will almost never feel as intuitive or as good as a mac.having been in an academic tech support job for a bunch of years (and an equally long-term relationship) and having shepherded though thousands of purchases and then supported those devices, i've found giving the person who'll actually be using a thing (laptop, printer, gps, phone, &c.) a set of known-good options and letting them decide is a great practice.i just built a desktop based on a core i3 and it is significantly faster than what it replaced and multitasks just fine.if your wife or you happen to teach or go to a school, you might be able to get it for free from the school, or at a steep discount.other than that, good internal hardware hardware is very cheap and similar among brands (caveats being intel chips tend to run a bit cooler for the same performance vs. amd, and if you care about discrete video go for one that has that, otherwise ram and hard drives are easily accessible/upgradeable, but i'm sure other threads are covering that).from time to time if you upgrade too quickly it will refuse to activate, but if you let it set for a period of time it'll install just fine.the hardware is assembled from various oem distributors, and depending on who they sourced their touchpad to and how good their driver development is, you will either get basic "scroll bars along edge of pad" functionality, or very poorly implemented pinch-zoom.often models that you find in electronics or office supply stores that seem promising in terms of form factor are exclusive to those stores and can't be found online.with the exception of some flash games, nothing accessible via browser or email client is going to require much in the way of processor power.the only difference is that instead of relying on advertisements alone, you can peruse some of the extensive and exhaustive reviews of current laptops from various manufacturers that you can find online.apple's product differentiation is great at defeatingthe paradox of choice â€” you have a few base models, the difference between which is quite obvious, and you can customize each.you will find yourself using the ctrl key very often (less so than in a mac since right click is built in, but still); it's generally more ergonomically comfortable to use the leftmost edge of your left hand to hit the ctrl buttonif that's where it's located.
