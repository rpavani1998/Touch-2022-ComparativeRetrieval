for web based information consumption and participation a simplified ui offers great advantages.as we move towards more on-line services, i think, for a lot of users, a simplified interface will be fine and ios or a web browser interface will work.probably the biggest argument against this analysis is the fact that apple’s mac sales have been going up every quarter for the last five years, steadily outpacing the growth of all the other brands with limited exceptions.the laptop or desktop will remain the most home user’s computing powerhouse and the mac os x will be running that on apple.in apple’s case, mac os x is the perfect platform for developing the apps that drive iphone and ipad sales.icloud will make file transfer more transparent but will not read, manipulate or write the file as you wish and the os and it the applications on it will read, manipulate or write files.for photo editing, research and content creation, the ios interface is too restrictive.hence porting iphone apps to ipad is relatively easy despite the disparate hardware platforms involved.however, it would be perfectly possible for apple to keep os x alive as a development platform, and eventually migrate its laptops/mac mini to ios.however there probably are millions of laptop owners who do little content creation so an “ipad with a keyboard” may well be an ideal device for them.for simple “non productive” tasks, such as web browsing or emailing, a tablet os is fine.all the functions of an actual “operating system” (memory management, device interaction, process tables, networking, etc) are handled by the same darwin underpinnings as mac osx.mac sales are up hugely, that isn’t a sign that people don’t want ‘pc’ like machines to do more than they can on their ios device.apple know that, they are not stupid – they have to provide a platform for ‘power’ users (not only for developers, but many other users).the ios/app store walled garden fits their perception of the consumer need and is a flexible way to monitise services to this market.
