i myself bought my macbook because some friends had ibooks and i found them nifty.
i was kind of slow to notice this build-up, kind of resistant to the idea of buying into the cult of apple and probably should have made the switch sooner, could have used this productivity boost a year ago, but, whatever, i'm glad that i eventually cottoned on.
i was rather pleased with myself too; we used one of those 50% off coupons i found and got a great-spec machine for the price.
for instance, i run windows xp sandboxed on my dual core macbook pro laptop, and that's the only place i run windows at all.
it's only mildly better than the previous (and related) apple pc software i used, quicktime, which in addition to having arbitrary annoying restrictions and nag screens also came up with one of the worst ui elements ever: the volume dial in software.
real os's make using a single mouse button easy, and thus make the vegistal extra mouse button pc laptops struggle to include in a place that is not an ergonomic disaster unneeded.

you can run freebsd or linux on the "expensive" apple machine as well.
so overall, we have not seen any reduction in quality over the past few years, no increase in maintenance costs, and they are very reliable units.
windows isn't allowed to get to the net where it can get hurt, i just use it to host a few desktop applications that don't have mac equivalents.

most of the price difference between apple and pc is actually represented in the 2ndary specs, and build quality.

that would suggest that apple's own sales are also doing "well." apple set a new record of 1.7 million macs last quarter, which is commonly its slowest quarter.
i wanted a sub £1000 notebook with dedicated graphics and a 15.4" screen.
for the record, my office is a windows xp only shop, so all those mac owners are running xp on their macs (at least at work).
external displays work as expected.

so i can honestly say the apple's success here is unsurprising to me; the laptop market is one that is well-suited to apple's core strengths.

you say that now but when you realize how much more manageable a single large button is that you can chord into two, vs. two mouse buttons on a laptop where at least one is awkward to hit... on top of that applications are designed to work with one mouse button instead of requiring two, the single button design aspect across all mac platforms is what allows the laptops to be especially usable.
there are also a lot of tools available in the command-line environment, as well as open source software that can be compiled for mac os x.
