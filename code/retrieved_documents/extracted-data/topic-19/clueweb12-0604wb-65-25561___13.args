all goes well when you want to buy a base system, but as soon as you want to add options, be prepared to be murdered.
the funny part is that most of the utilities you mentioned when touting osx are actually present in vista (most obviously, the accelerated desktop with seamless animations).
the 200gb drive in the dell is also most likely a 7200rpm vs the 5400rpm in the macbook pro. 802.11n
the cheapest macbook is 1000$+.
heck, even torvalds has been critical of the file system.
my system absolutely crushes that $2000 macbook pro in every category... and still cost $450 less.
i am an experienced user, though, and like things to be my way; easily accessible; not screwed up.
and to generalize it this way shows the lack of willing to understand the core of the mac: it’s operating system.
i don't think that comparing the macbook pro and the xps m1730 is a good comparison; the xps is a desktop-replacement gaming machine, and is therefore bigger and heavier than the mac.
this does result in better performance with larger files, and the media-junkies are apple's historical bread and butter (by the way, write about wysiwyg, color management, etc. for apple, which is much better, actually).
due to competition the price is always lower.
apple really stabs you in the face when you’re upgrading your mac.
for a laptop that dell indicates is a gaming machine, shared memory is a disappointment, as graphics is an important area for 3d gaming.
not because it doesn't have market share.
apple really stabs you in the face when you’re upgrading your mac.
and there’s no doubt that you can get an equally equipped pc, or build one yourself, for less money.
the cheapest laptop i can find with vista is 600 or less at costco/sams club.
wifi is a $20 upgrade on the dell, had to not include that to make the mac look better.
i work on these every day and if i ever bought one, it'd be for the looks- the os is nothing special imo.
all goes well when you want to buy a base system, but as soon as you want to add options, be prepared to be murdered.
anyone who knows even a small amount about graphics cards should know that an 8700m gt does not use shared graphics memory.
i also have legitimate hand’s on experience of [with] macs.
i own a small computer retail chain and we actually have 2 back to school packages (1 apple, 1 windows) for the identical price and have yet to sell 1 of the apple packages.
bottom line: macs aren’t "way more" expensive than pcs.
but when you compare apple against a mid range system, which the average buyer will be purchasing, the mac falls short every time.
i realize that when you're going the apple route you don't have many options, but those of us on the pc side have tons of options... and even the most basic among us would be able to purchase higher performing, lower cost pcs than the ones you selected to go up against the apples.
he just tried to make macbook look better and compared this macbook to a totally different laptop that is priced equally with the macbook.
apple’s macbook pro has several small advantages over the xps, mainly with the magsafe connector and it’s nearly take-for-granted use.
in fact, i mentioned this in my previous article, although some people seemed to have completely missed the page where i complained about apple’s outrageous prices altogether.
the laptops especially slow to a crawl unless they have >2gb of ram.
i respect the fact that you 'tried' (keyword here is tried) to show the good qualities of mac computers, however this is mainly an enthusiast site, so you will be very hard pressed to fool us into thinking apple offerings are anywhere near as good as others (especially on price/performance ratio).
in terms of hardware, there’s nothing really special about a mac aside from elegant designs, be it a mac pro or macbook pro, that makes it incredibly more worthwhile than the pc equivalent.
for the most part, the two systems are comparable, indicating that at least for a laptop, apple’s pricing fits in line with comparable hardware.
you can get a better performing pc for a fraction of the cost, and its not a misconception.
for absolute performance, the screen size won’t matter here, but the slow shared graphics memory on the xps will.
after my first article on macs and os x, there were several readers who just down right bashed macs for pricing and os x without solid reasoning or legitimate hand’s on experience of macs.
for a laptop that dell indicates is a gaming machine, shared memory is a disappointment, as graphics is an important area for 3d gaming.
and to generalize it this way shows the lack of willing to understand the core of the mac: it’s operating system.
the os is proprietary since the eula states you cannot use it on non-apple hardware.
let’s take a quick look at some of apple’s competition and their pricing structure compared to apple’s: we went to dell’s website and picked out what dell indicated was a serious gaming laptop.
we also took the xps model that was priced the same as the baseline macbook pro.
the m1530 starts at $1000, and with identical specs to the macbook pro (and vista ultimate), the price is $1650.
so that's a 42% premium for the mac.
certain things like shared memory for graphics leave some performance desires for the xps, but the xps has a strong leg up on the macbook pro with the larger screen size.
the truth to apple's pricing the advantage: running mac os x and windows vista opengl interface, quick view, dashboard integrated utilities, and built-in options windows is getting better too the never ending pc and mac war next page
for absolute performance, the screen size won’t matter here, but the slow shared graphics memory on the xps will.
macs and their prices we build a pc to match a baseline mac pro total misconceptions and being severely...
oh and another thing - if you play games at all, you can forget the apple.
the biggest differences are the screen size, weight, thickness, and shared memory.
additional thought: the author's main point is that macs are similarly priced to pc's.
i need an os for my new system so since os x isn't proprietary, can you please point me to where i can pick up a copy to run on my computer.
they messed up big time with this article.
the next version of photoshop will only natively support x64 in windows.
mostly, scratch that, everyone i know that owns a mac, has it because, like you said, they want to be cool.
i priced a matching xps 1530 (same size screen and resolution), with identical specs to the mac, excepting only the built-in bluetooth, for $1399.
for $1549 i purchase an hp laptop w/ 4 gb of ram, 20.1 inch screen, blu-ray, 5 speakers, and an nvidia 8800 gts.
the author is being disingenuous by picking for comparison laptops at non-discounted prices.
tomshardware used to be my favorite site, because it had objective, technical articles.
macbook pro power cord and the magsafe design literally saved the laptops from flying.
apples are designed to look good and be reliable.
also lets go ahead and say that the 8600m gt is faster than the 8700m gt.
let’s take a quick look at some of apple’s competition and their pricing structure compared to apple’s: we went to dell’s website and picked out what dell indicated was a serious gaming laptop.
not only that, pc's aren't "sole source", like macs, leaving open the option to shop around for a better deal.russki 08/04/2008 6:37 pm it would be a shame to regurgitate the above posts, but again, quite lackluster, tuan.
and there’s no doubt that you can get an equally equipped pc, or build one yourself, for less money.
although the envy 133 does include an external optical drive, tacking on apple’s quite expensive $99 macbook air superdrive to the purchase of the macbook air still leaves a $200 gap.
out of the box, for a clueless person, macs are indeed a good (albeit expensive; read the posts above) option.
pmr100 08/04/2008 6:19 pm macbooks are way overpriced.
although the envy 133 does include an external optical drive, tacking on apple’s quite expensive $99 macbook air superdrive to the purchase of the macbook air still leaves a $200 gap.
you attempt to argue mac's are similarly priced to pc's.
the pc will always win in the price category (and usually performance as well) because you pay for the reliability and style of apple.
your component list, and laptop comparisons were clearly set up to put the mac at an advantage.
that blazing 16ms response time is insane.
that just goes to prove for that same cost as a very high end pc you can get a base model mac with a very proprietary os (i.e. can't install it on anything but a mac with invoking the jobs cops, check the eula).
they really aren't designed to be performers for cheap.
oh yes another $200, so thats a $400 gap, and you still have a smaller screen, no blue ray drive, a smaller harddrive, and half the video memory.
high end specialty systems are always going to draw a high price; that is to be expected; that apple is competitive in the $3000 range does not matter to the vast vast majority of people who spend not even half that.
however, building a pc to do the same isn’t the point, because you can always buy a cheaper car to get you from a to b. instead, let’s see what you can get for $2000, from apple and from others.
i know people are going to shoot me for this, but i find all of the fancy desktop effects to be very laggy except on laptops with a dedicated video card.
cherry picking over-priced pcs does little to prove your point.
we also took the xps model that was priced the same as the baseline macbook pro.
because there are so many many pc vendors, it should not be hard to find one that is screwing its customers like apple and charging too much; but the prices at the store shelf tell the true story.
after my first article on macs and os x, there were several readers who just down right bashed macs for pricing and os x without solid reasoning or legitimate hand’s on experience of macs.
obviously if you build a pc with the exact same overpriced hardware, it will be exactly the same price.
for another comparison, let’s look at the macbook air to voodoopc’s envy 133:apple vs. voodoopc price comparison $1799 macbook air $2099 envy 133 at this point, the envy is $300 more expensive than the macbook air.
games just aren't made for it and the ones that are come out 1 year after the pc release.
for the most part, the two systems are comparable, indicating that at least for a laptop, apple’s pricing fits in line with comparable hardware.
wow, you took a pc desktop with identical hardware and proved that it would cost the same as the baseline mac pro.
for the same price the windows package runs the same cpu, 4gb memory, a 320gb hdd, better graphics, 16" screen 16:9 widescreen, a choice of 3 nice cases, wireless 300n router, microsoft office home and student and a logitech vxnano wireless mouse.
the advantage: running mac os x and windows vista 6.
no software package at this point, the envy is $300 more expensive than the macbook air.
certain things like shared memory for graphics leave some performance desires for the xps, but the xps has a strong leg up on the macbook pro with the larger screen size.
however, building a pc to do the same isn’t the point, because you can always buy a cheaper car to get you from a to b. instead, let’s see what you can get for $2000, from apple and from others.
i completely agree that osx is awesome and so are mac's ergonomics.
the one-button mouse must die.
i have seen several incidences where people have tripped over or through someone else’s macbook pro power cord and the magsafe design literally saved the laptops from flying.
in terms of hardware, there’s nothing really special about a mac aside from elegant designs, be it a mac pro or macbook pro, that makes it incredibly more worthwhile than the pc equivalent.
the point is you can pick a pc with cheaper hardware that can perform better.
the main point is that with pc's you have hundreds of different vendors i can buy a computer from.
please if you make the mistake of buy an airbook have fun changing the battery (you can't) or watching a dvd while on the road (again you can't no built in dvd drive).hixbot 08/04/2008
the hardware in the pc will be cheaper, faster alternatives...
you can build a pc with hardware that isn't identical but performs better for cheaper.
it has many cool utilities.
seriously, i have no idea why he compares the macs to pcs with the exact same overpriced hardware.
picking the same overpriced pc components doesnt prove anything.
also that dell is designed for sli graphics cards upto two 8800m gtx with 1gb of memory, lets see the 6lb macbook pro do that.
one problem: hyundai’s don’t have nice european car exteriors.
i gotta say though, i was forced to use one of these atrocities at a bestbuy the other day to access internet, and i was quite turned off by several things that appeared to be major annoyances.
apple’s macbook pro has several small advantages over the xps, mainly with the magsafe connector and it’s nearly take-for-granted use.
everyone says that os x is faster and yada yada yada.
also, the 8700m gt will outperform the 8600gt, and i am unable to find where it specifies that the 8700 has shared graphics memory.
furthermore you choose two out of three products that are low volume special use items.
we know what we're buying, we know what each piece of hardware is capable of doing, you can't just throw fancy numbers at us and expect us to fall for it.
sony, with the same processor, better graphics, double the ram, bigger hard drive, and a blue ray drive, for $200 less.

dell sells the xps m1530 which is a 15.4 inch laptop designed more for multimedia than for gaming (similar to the mac).
my gripe with apple's pricing is that there are no real budget oriented options.
they look awesome, are well built, have an awesome retail presence, and they are right for some people... just not for me.
comparing thickness and weight of a 17" laptop vs a 15" macbook pro. sounds fair to me.
then halfway through the article, he states that mac prices are at a premium because it's from a top-shelf manufacturer and it is sold to cater to a "lifestyle.
the biggest differences are the screen size, weight, thickness, and shared memory.
the thing is, with the first article i thought you were just sharing your personal opinion, however, with this article it's clear you're an apple fanboy and will be labeled as such.
the envy has a carbon fiber chassis.
