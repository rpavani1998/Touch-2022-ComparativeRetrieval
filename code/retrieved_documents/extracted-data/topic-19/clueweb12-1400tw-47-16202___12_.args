those using windows have been aware for a long time that their systems have vulnerabilities, and so they are much more likely to use some form of protection such as anti-virus software.it is my understanding that macs are definitely now becoming a focus of attention for the authors of malware exactly because they know that they are surrounded by this invulnerability culture and often left unprotected and so they can use them as carriers to inject malware into networks and other systems.mac os users think their systems are somehow inherently “secure” and hence they are less likely to update as frequently as windows users, or to use tools such as anti-virus software.mac os users may be "safer" than windows users, simply because they have fewer attacks focussed on their systems, but they are not more "secure".so far apple have done a good job patching vulnerabilities & it is not necessary for mac users to degrade their user experience by running intrusive and performance degrading security products.patching any vulnerabilities will ensure that such drive-by attacks will be nullified.a mac os user is less likely to be attacked than a windows user, but that is nothing to do with the level of vulnerability in the operating system.of course there is no such thing as a totally secure system, but the clunky design of windows & the whole retarded user experience forced by using windows, means that users are more likely to be trapped into downloading and running malware.apple has its part to play by releasing updates rapidly in response to known vulnerabilities, and users need to make sure they implement those updates as well asinstalling security software to protect against the coming threat.adobe flash, java, and a number of other add-in and plug-ins make all computers more vulnerable.windows users also typically update their software when an update is released by microsoft; they know updates mean that vulnerabilities may have been found, and it is safer to update than be exposed.fundamentally, there is no reason why macs should not be targeted using malware in the same way that viruses, trojans and worms are built to target windows systems.that gives you an os that is targeted less frequently and a user that knows they are not invincible and updates their machine and av software regularly.for example, since vista was introduced in 2007, windows has had address space layout randomisation (aslr) which is implemented so as to obscure most of what an attacker needs to conduct, for example, shell code injection attacks.a mac isn’t susceptible to the thousands of viruses plaguing windows-based computers.
