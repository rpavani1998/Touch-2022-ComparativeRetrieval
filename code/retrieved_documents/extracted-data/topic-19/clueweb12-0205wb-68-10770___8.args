apple + shift + 3 the mac uses a one-button mouse.
vmware’s fusion uses the same approach on the mac as it does in its server software.
the mac reputation macs are thought to be systems that run creative software better (music, graphics, and video editing) and that give users a better ‘personal’ experience.
the monitor is much nicer than my pc monitors (desktop and notebook).
(an example would be comparing microsoft’s paint with adobe’s illustrator.)  if one will only be using the bundled applications, there’s no doubt those provided with the mac os are better.
i also found that you can plug a two-button mouse into the mac and get all of the functionality available in the pc.
pc-on-a-mac fusion observations the first thing i noticed was how fast the pc ran!
the mac i used for testing was a macbook pro running mac os x 10.4.11 (tiger) with a 2.4ghz intel core 2 duo processor, 4gb ram, 160gb hard drive, and 17-inch monitor.
for a comparison, i took our vacation slides from this summer and made them into a dvd.
i also setup virtual linux and windows vista computers and had success in each.
i set up a virtual pc having one processor, 1gb of ram, and a 60gb hard drive.
we can make them work with pcs on the same network, and even run pc applications on them very well.
10.7 lion is a big thumbs down.
the software installation was surprisingly easy, and setup was too.
i set up a virtual pc having one processor, 1gb of ram, and a 60gb hard drive.
but few on church and ministry it staffs can support them, relegating their support to the mac user.
basic mac os apps the mac os (operating system) comes with bundled software, like windows does, to help users manage creative files.
full applications full featured applications for these tasks can usually be bought to run on either the mac or pc.
these are sometimes referred to as applets because they’re simple applications when compared to their commercial counterparts.
my high-end macbook pro cost easily double what i would have spent for a similarly equipped pc.
when users are responsible for their own support, they rarely backup their files.
when something happens (like what happened twice to me!), if their files aren’t backed up, they will have to spend quite a bit of time recreating them.

that makes sense, of course, when you consider that it’s virtual and all running in the mac’s ram.
this makes using the mac in low light enjoyable and easy… something i’ve always felt was missing from my pc notebooks.
they definitely cost more, but saying, “no.”
the mac mystique macs have an undeniable mystique about them, and it’s causing many on our teams to request them.
it then asked me to insert my windows installation disk, and from there on it was like setting up any other windows pc.

i also found that you can plug a two-button mouse into the mac and get all of the functionality available in the pc.
i also found that i couldn’t extend any pc programs across multiple monitors… they all must run in a single monitor.
both were caused by weaknesses in the os that allowed it to corrupt itself: the mac mystique macs have an undeniable mystique about them, and it’s causing many on our teams to request them.
vmware assures me that functionality is coming in an update.
requests for macs will keep coming, and they can work in your environment.
so i decided to do my testing using their fusion product to create a virtual pc on the mac.
editing pictures, video, and sound are all similarly better in mac applets.
i could run all of the pc programs i normally run on a pc very nicely using vmware’s fusion!
you create a virtual pc following easy prompts asking how large the hard drive should be, how much ram it should have, etc.
full applications full featured applications for these tasks can usually be bought to run on either the mac or pc.
before that happened, pc software couldn’t run well on a mac.
vmware assures me that functionality is coming in an update.
it took my pc applications and allowed them to run as normal floating ‘windows’ on the mac desktop!
if one will only be using the bundled applications, there’s no doubt those provided with the mac os are better.
that includes ms office 2007 (including outlook and visio), sql databases, bible study software (libronix), and utilities i use to setup microsoft networks.
vmware’s fusion uses the same approach on the mac as it does in its server software.
it was worth it because supporting macs is part of our business model, but i would otherwise have a hard time justifying the cost difference.
macs cost more than pcs.
to mac requests pretty quickly.
it was worth it because supporting macs is part of our business model, but i would otherwise have a hard time justifying the cost difference.
fusion also gave me the option of setting up the ability to share folders between the two desktops!
i discovered that right-click functionality is available using the mac’s mouse while pressing the ctrl key.
it turned out very nice.
you create a virtual pc following easy prompts asking how large the hard drive should be, how much ram it should have, etc.  they give you suggestions along with minimum and maximum ranges.
make sure you have a team ready to help with the initial setup and ongoing support of your macs, and you’ll be okay.

the monitor is much nicer than my pc monitors (desktop and notebook).
since the decision for hardware is best made based on the software in use, the pcvs mac issue had been relatively easy.
but macs can run pc software now, so the question is going to keep coming.
the software installation was surprisingly easy, and setup was too.
many it professionals are working with vmware’s virtual server products, and our firm has had great success with them.

this technology works, and is ready to help us as we focus on building the kingdom.
so my pc applications looked very similar to my mac applications!
before that happened, pc software couldn’t run well on a mac.  while there were ways to access pc software from a mac, the experience was usually a bad one, and few pursued the option strongly.
fusion also gave me the option of setting up the ability to share folders between the two desktops!
and though there’s no command prompt function, there is a similar mac function called terminal which opens a window you can run unix commands in.

the problems are: those who will use them are likely called to minister, not to support computers.
these are sometimes referred to as applets because they’re simple applications when compared to their commercial counterparts.
giving them support responsibility means they’ll be doing so at least some of the time we’d rather see them fulfilling their call to minister.
but few on church and ministry it staffs can support them, relegating their support to the mac user.
in those cases, the software is pretty close to the same in capability, with two exceptions: the underlying os requires some things to be laid out and approached differently.
once someone gets used to the different approaches on either side, they will prefer doing their work in their familiar os.

it should know that certain files cannot have their rights changed to protect the integrity of the system.

little did i know that doing so with three needing restarts would corrupt the os!
