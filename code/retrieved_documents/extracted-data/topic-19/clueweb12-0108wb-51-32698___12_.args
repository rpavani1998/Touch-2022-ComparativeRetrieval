this means the identifying, and deleting of the viruses is 100% effective and 120% more effective than a mac's security.md5 hashes are like fingerprints for programs, and cannot be hidden, changed, or misused in any way or form.pc pros> can run games, supports a hell of a lot of hardware, can be upgrade if needed and software and controls 90% of the market.it seems to me that by going to a mac, you end up with a different breed of computer but not necessarily one that will run programs any better.apart from the fact that the operating system needs additional security care, i think the same can be said of windows 7.7- ultimate pc's are much better, esspecially security wise i have used both windows pc's, and mac's in the past and found that even a free antivirus installed on a windows pc is better than a mac os, even with their own security systems.their security systems are still identifying viruses by their name, size, icon, etc.(if i am wrong, please correct me) pc cons> can get a virus, can be hacked, can over heat and/or catch fire.as (again, i believe, but may be wrong) all the hardware is designed by apple, it all just 'works' together much better, whereas with a pc, the mainboard may be from one company, graphics card another... soundcard a different one still, etc... not necessarily all totally compatible).some specialist programmes may not be available on macs * repairs may cost more... or at least harder to 'user repair' or 'user upgrade'after all, no one knows everything and you may have the answer that someone needs.macs until a few years ago were very hard to get help with and software too, but as people have stated it is getting better.once you get used to them, they work really well, less clunky than many pcs *it's a good platform for development and designing as well, yet the pc is no worse i think..reply with quote pc pros> can run games, supports a hell of a lot of hardware, can be upgrade if needed and software and controls 90% of the market.
