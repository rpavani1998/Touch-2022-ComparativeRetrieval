all the energy of production and transport and packaging contributes to how "green" a product is - a less recyclable machine with a longer "shelf life" and more accessible repairs and upgrades would, in the end, be much greener than a "merely" recyclable machine.apple, on the other hand, along with sony, panasonic, pioneer, toyota, honda, john deere and caterpillar, have all earned well established reputations for producing high qualityhard good products because of well thought out designs and first class quality control systems.long-lasting, durable, upgradable, and fixable are just as, maybe more important than recyclable.you save money, create less pollution, use fewer resources.the damage is cosmetic, but significantly decreases resale value, and be unacceptable to people seeking repairs.apple is forcing people into using their extremely expensive repair services, which often make buying a new device cheaper.in all my experience with apple products, apple has almost repeatedly shown it's self to choose "looks" over quality of material.even self-built computers have a shelf life - hard disks die, fans fail, upgrades are needed.obviously they want ipods to be disposable things that go bad and need to be replaced, there's no money in something that lasts forever and can be repaired by anyone, that doesn't generate any revenue for them.anyway, repairing some broken electronic telecomunication devices, can increase the level of radiations, so t will be more dangerous than ever.the aluminium and glass used in the imac, macbook, and macbook pro are highly recyclable.i think the problems of durability, usability over the long haul, repairability and upgradability have been seen industry-wide.if you don't own gadgets like this you do not have to get them fixed, recycled, maintained.we've got to keep 7 billion people happy without destroying our planet.all manufactures should, in their own best interests (read the great book "green to gold"), prominently describe to their customers how to do this easily and effectively.
