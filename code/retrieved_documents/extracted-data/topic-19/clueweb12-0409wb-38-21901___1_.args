the discreet system though powerful, costs quite a bit on the side of hardware, and running on windows nt (can't comment on xp) had a fair number of crashes.in day to dy use, this is not substuantial enough to cause mass panic between the two, but having used both, in my opinion, the mac is slightly the superior.as well, the powerpc architecture has far more advanced fpu's than x86.the fcp system ran fine on a high end emac, which is a consumer model.however, when it comes to hardware, i would have to say that the mac also has the advantage.
