if you want to decide between a mac or windows pc for general use, then i'll list you some pros and cons: mac pros: does not easily get viruses and malware.macs are cool computers and i totally love 'em for what they are, but they don't play nice in most business networks.if you are really interested in trying out a mac, try to find someone you know who has one and will let you screw around on it for a bit.adobe and apple made a deal so that the adobe programming worked better with the mac os.good customer service.cons: can get viruses and malware very easy (you should scan it often with anti-virus programs).if you want to use adobe photoshop then using it on a mac or windows pc will make now difference.cons: very expensive (you will be paying substantially more for the same exact hardware you would get on a windows machine just for the brand name).oh and by the way, if you ever need help finding a computer to buy, i'd be more than happy to help.cannot use software/programs not made for mac (you can use a program that runs windows on your mac, however that is also very expensive and involves partitioning your hard drive.)very good selection when it comes to purchasing choice.now, here's the it guy in my coming out (that's my day job), if you ever plan on taking your computer to work or to school or anything else like that, i'd highly advise getting a pc.more customizable (although this probably doesn't concern the average user like you.)you may or may not have noticed but recently mac's started using intel processors.can run the majority of software made today, as most of it is made for windows.
