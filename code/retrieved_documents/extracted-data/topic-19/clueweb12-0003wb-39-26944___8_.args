i would like to think that the resulting pages are a comprehensive, beneficial, and unique resource towards helping people get a better understanding of the very important mac vs pc issue.in honor of the macintosh 20th year anniversary (2004), you’ll note that i have included a few screen shots from the 1984 superbowl advertisement (one of the most acclaimed advertisement in history), as its message still resonates today.my challenge has been to find (i.e. research) and read well overfour thousand studies, reports, and articles that have been published on the macvs pc topic.if i knew more code i could probably do a better job of having pages look optimum for all browsers on all platforms.this web site is designedto help you make a more informed computer purchase, not to showcase web page design — i.e.the emphasis is on the 115± pages (8.5" x 11") of ad-free content.haikus are used to communicate a timeless message, often achieving a wistful, yearning and powerful insight through extreme brevity.to make this site more useful, i have set up the html so that when you click on a link, anew window will open with that information (while keeping the page you were on, in the background).as i’ve said all along, even though i amnot a professional web designer, hopefully you will find the site reasonably easy to navigate and attractively laid out.this should make navigation simpler for you.after you look the new page over and then close that window (a simple keyboard shortcut), you will immediately be back at the original referencing page.my main objective was to be able to transcribe all this technical mumbo-jumbo into an educational, interesting, readable — and occasionally even entertaining — report.we realize that "pc" stands for "personal computer" — which means that macsare pcs.however, to be accurately informed, i would suggest that you first read theentire site (115± pages of some 1200 referenced reports, studies, etc.).download a single printable pdf version of the whole site, with hyperlinks and bookmarks (115± pages, 1.8 mb; revised: 5/04/05).that said something similar to the following: in japan, they have replaced the impersonal and unhelpful microsoft error messages with haiku poetry messages.
