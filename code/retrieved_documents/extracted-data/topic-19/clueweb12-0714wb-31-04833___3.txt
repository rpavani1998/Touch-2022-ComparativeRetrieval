if you want to use adobe photoshop then using it on a mac or windows pc will make now difference.
so essentially, that $2,400 macbook is exactly the same thing as that $800 windows laptop.

customer  service depends your your retailer.
very good selection when it comes to purchasing choice.
cons: can get viruses and malware  very easy (you should scan it often with anti-virus programs).
which of these sound good to you?
oh and by the way, if you ever need help finding  a computer to buy, i'd be more than happy to help.

schools are typically a bit more friendly, but even then you can run into issues.
you will have to get used to using it if you've used windows all your life.
but, what a picture you can paint with a thousand words!
if you are really interested in  trying out a mac, try to find someone you know who has one and will let you  screw around on it for a bit.

cannot use software/programs not made for mac (you can use a program that runs windows on your mac, however that is also very expensive and involves partitioning your hard drive.)
windows was clunky and simply could not handle the processing load.
(very likely you  will be pressured to get one if you are in the graphic design field just to fit  in.)

3d is best on windows or unix but only factories use unix(most stable os linux is a modded core version) --
now, here's the it guy in my coming out (that's my day job), if you ever plan on taking your computer to work or to school or anything else like that, i'd highly advise getting a pc.
so there's my two-cents.
reply *wrensthavaviovus jul 15, 2011 adobe products work more efficiently on macs than pcs with the same stat's hardware wise.
- jan 8, 2011 what would you prefer from me in terms of da socializing?
macs are cool computers and i totally love 'em for what they are, but they don't play nice in most business networks.

you are probably  used to using a windows operating system.

you may or may not have noticed but recently mac's started using intel processors.
-- walt, hit the retaliate button!
cons: very expensive (you will be paying  substantially more for the same exact hardware you would get on a windows  machine just for the brand name).
you will have to get used to using it if  you've used windows all your life.
