this particular 3d printer is the leading edge of rapid prototyping today and this capability would allow the department to teach students practices that are currently used in the top tier of industry and would allow them to enter the workforce armed with this knowledge.the addition of this machine would allow university students access with the modern technology for rapid prototyping and direct digital manufacturing which is used across several industries, but cannot found at other universities.these shortcomings impose great limitations on the size, shape, look, and durability of the part students are able to make, which falls short of the current capabilities of 3d printing technology.this machine can really make a difference for not only engineering students, but the student body in general.this machine would modernize the ways we design, prototype, and manufacture components using new materials.the exposure to such technology would set uw students apart and ahead, applicable in any engineering, scientific, or design industry.making such unique parts directly using the fortus 400mc machine from the cad model would cut the cost and time to manufacture these parts, allowing for more flexibility, experimentation, and capability in the design process for these engineering students.the fortus 400mc fdm machine represents the cutting edge of 3d printing technology and resolves these shortcomings, allowing for students to expand the type and quality of the models and parts that can be produced.it is my hope that the stf committee recognizes from this proposal the great need for such equipment, the prestige it can bring to the university, and that this funding would indeed be beneficial for all students who want to turn their cad drawings into a real part.in addition, students will benefit from the experience to use one of the top of the line prototyping machines, offering a competitive edge which cannot be claimed by any other university.a 3d printer which makes autoclave molds will be a tremendous contribution to the airplane design education program at the university of washington, allowing our students to design and build more complex composite parts.this machine also introduces the capability to manufacture directly from cad to final end-use parts thanks to the impressive range of high strength materials that can be used.this machine has the capability to rapidly print parts from cad models using standard abs plastics, as well as specialized high strength and high temperature resistant materials, a feat which cannot be achieved using other 3d printing technologies.mold manufacturing is therefore outsourced to expert machinists in order to create the mold on time and ensure accuracy, thus limiting these projects to having one chance to get the mold design correct.the proposed equipment is a fortus 400mc 3d fdm (fused deposition modeling) system from stratasys which would provide a great resource for university students across several disciplines.
