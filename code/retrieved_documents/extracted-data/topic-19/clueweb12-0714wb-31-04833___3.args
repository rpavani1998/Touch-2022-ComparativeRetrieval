if you want to use adobe photoshop then using it on a mac or windows pc will make now difference.

devious comments load all images *bug-off jul 15, 2011 i... would not know the answer to that.
in my opinion you should get a windows pc, because i like them better, however like i said before it comes down to which one you prefer using.
easy to figure out what to buy, as they do everything for you.
adobe and apple made a deal so that the adobe programming worked better with the mac os.

very good selection when it comes to purchasing choice.
cons: can get viruses and malware very easy (you should scan it often with anti-virus programs).

cannot use software/programs not made for mac (you can use a program that runs windows on your mac, however that is also very expensive and involves partitioning your hard drive.)
windows was clunky and simply could not handle the processing load.
if you want to decide between a mac or windows pc for general use, then i'll list you some pros and cons: mac pros: does not easily get viruses and malware.
3d is best on windows or unix but only factories use unix(most stable os linux is a modded core version) --
