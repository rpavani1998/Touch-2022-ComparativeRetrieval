so far, apple’s extended warranty, applecare  protection plan, is the most expensive in the industry.
based on the arguments found in most online message boards, the long-lasting debate has been reduced to this: advocates of windows pcs are ignorant and clueless about computers and their features, and mac fans are elitists or social climbers.
they come in different designs, colors and sizes, and they differ in specifications and features.
and even though there are now some virus attacks on macs,  they are still more secure [even without antivirus software] compared to a  windows pc that runs an antivirus program.
aside from the expensive mac unit, its parts and services are also expensive.
mac’s service and repairs can cost even beyond the unit’s cost.

you can buy a brand  new fully set up desktop pc for more or less php 25,000.00.

imacs, however, come in few basic variants.
macs look more stylish and sleek than most pcs and thus, it appeals very much to the consumers who are looking for computers which are more modern and classy in appearance.
