it seems the mac civ v suffers from the exact same performance issues and graphical glitches that the pc version running in a cider shell does.some enterprising players have already begun doing so, in fact, and at least three tools replacing facets of these programs exist, and with significant improvement over the original functionality (for the windows platform, of course).i have worked with xml parsers and modular reloading python programs, and can not see why those methods would not be effective here, solely on the mac os x platform.our game is a native port that runs great in the supported systems – we fully support the game, will be posting mac specific updates, and are of course working the latest mac os versions as well.i would of course be interested myself in remedying this lack, and would be available to work with core developers by providing front-end interfaces for any external tools should they be deemed necessary (i am, of course, assuming that all core resources will be kept internal).as for the tools themselves, the tools provided by firaxis are, quite frankly, the pits, and you’re pretty much no better off using a text editor en lieu of modbuddy (it’s only a matter of knowledge and documentation, the workflow hardly seems improved).even worldbuilder, firetuner, and nexus could be re-implemented, and indeed, much improved upon from their .net counterparts.i feel reasonably confident at this point that i could whip up a quick script myself to apply any mod downloaded manually, backup the original assets, and replace them with an external app to effectively use mods in single player.i think most civ fans agree that ditching the mod engine for lack of tools denies the creations created by our windows using counterparts, and the ingenuity of mac modders to run virtualbox, parallels, or bootcamp.i prefer to use the qt libraries with the pyqt package, but of course am flexible if external demands prevent high level cross-platform solutions.to create an xml parser that reads pre-structured files and applies them to a database is less than a hundred lines of code, and to swap the source lua file for an execution of the code should be a mere handful of lines.simply modifying the mainmenu.xml in assets to display the mods menu as in the pc program was enough to restore the menu.the download from gameagent.com and/or the physical media does negate the need for a steam download.after a brief investigation of the resource files, i determined that they were, indeed, the same as the pc equivalents.in addition, they’restill working what’s left of their butts off to get the mac version up to speed with the pc via all the necessary patches and dlc.
