pcs open the door for users on a tight budget because competitive prices are within reach of most consumers.given that pcs make up the majority of all computers in the world, it makes sense that hackers are more inclined to create viruses for the operating system on which they can cause the most damage.mac's operating system on the whole, is considered to be more stable though and generally requires less maintenance than a pc.this means that pc manufacturers each have their own deal with windows for software, and are able to be ultra-competitive in the features and pricing of their hardware.depending on what you intend to use your pc for, or how you upgrade it will significantly affect the total cost of your computer.this means that apple determines specs, costs, and retailers allowed to carry them, and all their software runs seamlessly on their os x operating system.peripherals like printers and scanners may also have only been pc friendly, and although it is best to double-check that your peripherals are compatible with whatever your end choice may be, the majority of computer accessories will work with both the mac and pc.it should be noted however that both platforms are able to perform similar – if not the same functions, with the help of software specific to that use.support – because pcs enjoy market share majority, support tends to be easier to source and could be cheaper too.both use new technology like the intel core duo processor, which means that all pc apps are now able to run on a mac.browser-based tools like quickbooks online and web-based email, often eliminate the mac vs pc debate all together because they generally only require a basic computer to access and operate and a low end pc will do the trick.choosing the right platform for your office environment again, there is no right or wrong here, although in a business environment you are likely to keep a close eye on the costs of acquisition and maintenance of all business assets, and this alone is a determining factor for so many companies.when considering which is best for your household needs, take into account what kind of software you will need to satisfy your day-to-day activities, the upgrade fees associated with software and hardware for pcs, and your over-all budget for the machine itself.apple targets a higher market to begin with - above creating their own software and hardware, they use more expensive components and parts, which results in a higher up front cost.the costs in upgrading the operating system, increasing memory, or upgrading the software that most pc owners use on a day-to-day basis, is where the long-term costs come in.
