the mac reputation macs are thought to be systems that run creative software better (music, graphics, and video editing) and that give users a better ‘personal’ experience.we can make them work with pcs on the same network, and even run pc applications on them very well.in those cases, the software is pretty close to the same in capability, with two exceptions: the underlying os requires some things to be laid out and approached differently.both were caused by weaknesses in the os that allowed it to corrupt itself: the mac mystique macs have an undeniable mystique about them, and it’s causing many on our teams to request them.editing pictures, video, and sound are all similarly better in mac applets.these are sometimes referred to as applets because they’re simple applications when compared to their commercial counterparts.in those cases, the software is pretty close to the same in capability, with two exceptions: mac cost macs cost more than windows pcs.you create a virtual pc following easy prompts asking how large the hard drive should be, how much ram it should have, etc.  they give you suggestions along with minimum and maximum ranges.this makes using the mac in low light enjoyable and easy… something i’ve always felt was missing from my pc notebooks.the mac mystique macs have an undeniable mystique about them, and it’s causing many on our teams to request them.make sure you have a team ready to help with the initial setup and ongoing support of your macs, and you’ll be okay.once someone gets used to the different approaches on either side, they will prefer doing their work in their familiar os.before that happened, pc software couldn’t run well on a mac.  while there were ways to access pc software from a mac, the experience was usually a bad one, and few pursued the option strongly.but few on church and ministry it staffs can support them, relegating their support to the mac user.requests for macs will keep coming, and they can work in your environment.
