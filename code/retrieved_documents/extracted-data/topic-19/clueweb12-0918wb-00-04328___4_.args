(and, although we didn’t test it, we would expect vmware fusion to have better multi-processor support if you really have an application that is designed to take advantage of it.)if your goal is tight integration between one or more windows applications and mac os x, parallels is the clear winner when running either xp or vista.furthermore, in our tests, both vmware fusion and parallels performed well, and were a good user experience.to be honest, i cannot discern any difference in speed between my original implementation of boot camp and later parallels install, however, not having to reboot into each os, and the ease with which files can be shared between os’s are major advantages that parallels has over boot camp.you of course need an intel-based mac, and a full copy of windows xp sp2 or windows vista (business or ultimate), in order to run windows on a mac using any of these solutions.if you want a virtualization product (that allows you to run windows alongside mac os x), and you want the best performance for the types of things that we tested, then clearly you need to run xp and not vista.and, as we said before, if you want the best xp performance with the types of applications tested here, parallels is not only faster than vmware fusion, but it’s faster than boot camp on average for the applications that we tested.i have personally used both boot camp and parallels, and currently have parallels v3 running on a 2.33 ghz macbook pro with 3gb ram, and a new 2.4ghz imac with 4gb ram.for a comparison, and some insights into the differences, read the parallels vs. vmware fusion shootout at apple insider.you can follow any responses to this entry through therss 2.0 feed.you can leave a response, or trackback from your own site.if you don’t want mac integration, and just want to run windows, go with boot camp.it’s faster than a pc anyway.that said, parallels was somewhat faster in general than vmware fusion for xp.this is a very good price for windows xp sp2, and is what i used for my latest windows install on my new imac.the copy that came with your pc or an upgrade will not work.
