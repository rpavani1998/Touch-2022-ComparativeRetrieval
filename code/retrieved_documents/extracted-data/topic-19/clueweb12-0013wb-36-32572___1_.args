part of the reason for the creation of the architosh website is to evangelize and inform macintosh users everywhere that the macintosh is a viable platform for cad professionals, especially architects, engineers and construction professionals.the high-end glint card has 96mb of ram and uses it all, rendering complex, high-res 3d images far faster than any mainstream cpu can.the mac os provides a far superior user experience, and mac hardware definitely kicks butt.with mac os x being similar to unix, some of these applications may be easier to port over to mac os x.in terms of hardware we need multiprocessing g4's, altivec-enabled cad and 3d applications and a company like formac to create an industrial-strength 60 mb plus graphics card based on the glint graphics chipset or something better.in general adding an additional graphics card only allows you a second monitor capacity -- though it is possible to get this capacity with one graphics card in the pc space.however, a formac engineer told us that the permedia chipset uses a glint core in its silicon and has similar performance functionality at some levels.after discovering that formac is basing their mac graphics cards on 3dlabs' technologies one might wonder if they ever plan on bringing a super-fast, high-memory graphics card to the macintosh similar to the industrial strength oxygen cards.many readers simply said that sure the macintosh has great hardware specs and is easy to use and maintain but there simply isn't enough software for it (in the cad space that is).as much as i hate nt, apple cannot compete with it in the high-end without better products in hardware (mp g4s w/ slots) and software (os x consumer & third-party support).vectorworks and denebacad, both of which work better on macs, start around 700 bucks...and the price differential grows as you add more seats..." - reader "the real-world disadvantage to the mac is not hardware based, nor is it os based.let's try to solve that problem together by continuing to believe in the platform by purchasing more macs and macintosh software.it doesn't support macintosh either" "for example, my company has tasked me with the objective of placing a highly integrated sw system on up to 5,000 desktops within the next 5 years.things can change and if you are interested in such cards with up to 96 mb of graphics ram then write to formac and ati and ask them about it.add to that the lack of mp systems and weak support from the likes of autodesk, maya, and avid, and macs look weak indeed.
