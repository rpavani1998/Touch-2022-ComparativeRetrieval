make sure you have a team ready to help with the initial setup and ongoing support of your macs, and you’ll be okay.
it then asked me to insert my windows installation disk, and from there on it was like setting up any other windows pc.
so i decided to do my testing using their fusion product to create a virtual pc on the mac.
so my pc applications looked very similar to my mac applications!
full applications full featured applications for these tasks can usually be bought to run on either the mac or pc.
and though there’s no command prompt function, there is a similar mac function called terminal which opens a window you can run unix commands in.
in those cases, the software is pretty close to the same in capability, with two exceptions: mac cost macs cost more than windows pcs.
10.7 lion is a big thumbs down.
we can make them work with pcs on the same network, and even run pc applications on them very well.
i could run all of the pc programs i normally run on a pc very nicely using vmware’s fusion!
so i decided to do my testing using their fusion product to create a virtual pc on the mac.
vmware’s fusion uses the same approach on the mac as it does in its server software.
pc-on-a-mac fusion observations the first thing i noticed was how fast the pc ran!
i set up a virtual pc having one processor, 1gb of ram, and a 60gb hard drive.
little did i know that doing so with three needing restarts would corrupt the os!
that includes ms office 2007 (including outlook and visio), sql databases, bible study software (libronix), and utilities i use to setup microsoft networks.
the problems are: those who will use them are likely called to minister, not to support computers.
editing pictures, video, and sound are all similarly better in mac applets.
that makes sense, of course, when you consider that it’s virtual and all running in the mac’s ram.
it was worth it because supporting macs is part of our business model, but i would otherwise have a hard time justifying the cost difference.
but few on church and ministry it staffs can support them, relegating their support to the mac user.
many it professionals are working with vmware’s virtual server products, and our firm has had great success with them.
this makes using the mac in low light enjoyable and easy… something i’ve always felt was missing from my pc notebooks.
i also found that i couldn’t extend any pc programs across multiple monitors… they all must run in a single monitor.

basic mac os apps the mac os (operating system) comes with bundled software, like windows does, to help users manage creative files.
when users are responsible for their own support, they rarely backup their files.
i also setup virtual linux and windows vista computers and had success in each.

the mac mystique macs have an undeniable mystique about them, and it’s causing many on our teams to request them.
if one will only be using the bundled applications, there’s no doubt those provided with the mac os are better.
this makes using the mac in low light enjoyable and easy… something i’ve always felt was missing from my pc notebooks.
i also found that you can plug a two-button mouse into the mac and get all of the functionality available in the pc.
my high-end macbook pro cost easily double what i would have spent for a similarly equipped pc.
make sure you have a team ready to help with the initial setup and ongoing support of your macs, and you’ll be okay.
the software installation was surprisingly easy, and setup was too.
so my pc applications looked very similar to my mac applications!
fusion also gave me the option of setting up the ability to share folders between the two desktops!
it turned out very nice.
the software installation was surprisingly easy, and setup was too.
they definitely cost more, but saying, “no.”

the mac i used for testing was a macbook pro running mac os x 10.4.11 (tiger) with a 2.4ghz intel core 2 duo processor, 4gb ram, 160gb hard drive, and 17-inch monitor.
since the decision for hardware is best made based on the software in use, the pcvs mac issue had been relatively easy.
vmware’s fusion uses the same approach on the mac as it does in its server software.
i discovered that right-click functionality is available using the mac’s mouse while pressing the ctrl key.
requests for macs will keep coming, and they can work in your environment.
for a comparison, i took our vacation slides from this summer and made them into a dvd.

it should know that certain files cannot have their rights changed to protect the integrity of the system.
before that happened, pc software couldn’t run well on a mac.
the mac reputation macs are thought to be systems that run creative software better (music, graphics, and video editing) and that give users a better ‘personal’ experience.
apple + shift + 3 the mac uses a one-button mouse.
i also setup virtual linux and windows vista computers and had success in each.
these are sometimes referred to as applets because they’re simple applications when compared to their commercial counterparts.
you create a virtual pc following easy prompts asking how large the hard drive should be, how much ram it should have, etc.  they give you suggestions along with minimum and maximum ranges.
it took my pc applications and allowed them to run as normal floating ‘windows’ on the mac desktop!
both were caused by weaknesses in the os that allowed it to corrupt itself: the mac mystique macs have an undeniable mystique about them, and it’s causing many on our teams to request them.

vmware assures me that functionality is coming in an update.
giving them support responsibility means they’ll be doing so at least some of the time we’d rather see them fulfilling their call to minister.

before that happened, pc software couldn’t run well on a mac.  while there were ways to access pc software from a mac, the experience was usually a bad one, and few pursued the option strongly.
they definitely cost more, but saying, “no.”
the monitor is much nicer than my pc monitors (desktop and notebook).
when something happens (like what happened twice to me!), if their files aren’t backed up, they will have to spend quite a bit of time recreating them.
it was worth it because supporting macs is part of our business model, but i would otherwise have a hard time justifying the cost difference.
macs cost more than pcs.

once someone gets used to the different approaches on either side, they will prefer doing their work in their familiar os.
these are sometimes referred to as applets because they’re simple applications when compared to their commercial counterparts.
(an example would be comparing microsoft’s paint with adobe’s illustrator.)  if one will only be using the bundled applications, there’s no doubt those provided with the mac os are better.

i’m used to having full rights to the entire drive in windows, so i told the mac os to allow me the same on the mac harddrive.
vmware assures me that functionality is coming in an update.
in those cases, the software is pretty close to the same in capability, with two exceptions: the underlying os requires some things to be laid out and approached differently.
a function i wanted to run between my virtual pc and my mac didn’t have some file rights it needed.
