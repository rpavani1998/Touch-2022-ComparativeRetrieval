macs (in the past anyway) are better for graphics and are a bit easier to set up peripherals on (like printers, etc.), but pcs are good for gaming and have a better option for programs (even though windows can be used on macs, many programs cannot) and games and stuff.additionally, if a part on your pc breaks outside of warranty you can browse many shops and manufacturers and pick the cheapest part with the best quality.however macintosh computers are a lot better when it comes to multimedia editing compared to a pc.i know that with vms and emulation the mac is way better on this than it used to be, but we all know the mac is never going to be a gaming computer.another problem is that when something is wrong you have no choice but to return it to the apple shop you bought it at and then wait until they get it back from the workshop.this would be useful to someone new to computers or not so tech savvy, but it just slows me down.my parents' pc needs virus scans on a regular basis to get rid of spyware.so i'm not really in any position to judge, but i get the impression that more software is designed to run on a pc than on a mac pretty much, as far as i'm aware.but macs are 'spensive stuff, and i like the fact that with a pc you can pretty much put it together piece by piece to your own liking.i like osx, it has a clean layout, easy to use (easier than windows once you get used to it imo), doesn't get as many viruses as pcs do, etc.05-01-2009,Â 03:51 pm #7 14 thanked 20 times in 19 posts one advantage that macs have is you can install windows and have the option to run both.they hold your hand and guide you through everything.the macs i've used don't crash any more or less than the pcs i've used.so in short, while macs may be better in certain aspects, i despise the sheer iron grip they have on their market.for me, it was pretty easy to switch from pc to mac, but now when i go back and use a pc, i have to think for just a second about where to find stuff.
