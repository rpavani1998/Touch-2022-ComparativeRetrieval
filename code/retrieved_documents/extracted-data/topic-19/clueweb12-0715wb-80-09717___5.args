of course, this doesn’t matter much with mobile platform games (likeangry birds).
i also don’t like the hardware control that apple wants.
i just don’t see how spending the extra money on a mac is worth it.
myviewsonic is great for games, reading, movies and detailed design work and is crisper than my cinema display.
anyone (including that guy behind the counter in best buy) can swap out any part of your pc for the most recent edition.
no one but designers will care for this bit but it must be mentioned: font management (like auto activation of fonts) is much better on the mac.
sure, pc’s areexactly the same in this respect but as a designer you’re probably already using a mac so maximize your business dollars; stick with what you know.
lots of them don’t come out for it and the ones that do don’t get a ton of backend support for odd crashes.

the only time that becomes problematic is when a major change comes along (like intel’s dual core chip) which changes the face of pc tech.
so if mac users are having problems it’s not something that can turn the name of the company into a pariah.
i do quite a bit of design work and i love the adobe suite on my pc.
just remember that apple has some serious security issues.
the cinema display cost over a thousand; the viewsonic cost three hundred.
if you want upgradeability go with a pc; mac’s have a time stamp that lasts as long as the next conference in june or the christmas season.
if you do go that route, invest in antivirus and a decent firewall like little snitch.
if you’re planning to play the most recent video games you’re going to want to steer clear from a mac.

with web fonts on the grow, that can change.

shop around for a monitor because both macs and pc’s can use them (though mac’s usually with an adapter on everything but an imac which has a monitor built in) and it’s the one piece of equipment that might probably outlast your system.

apple’s monitors, though pretty, aren’t all that great considering their steep price tag.
ease of use, security, and stability of the operating system being the main reasons.

those very minor tasks (sorry they are) don’t necessitate all thatcranking power.
but then again, that mightjust mean a tablet—although not necessarily an ipad (which will still require a computer to set it up).

macs make up a small segment of video game producer’s market share so if mac users are having problems it’s not something that can turn the name of the company into a pariah.

i certainly agree that competition between the mac & pc platforms is healthy.
