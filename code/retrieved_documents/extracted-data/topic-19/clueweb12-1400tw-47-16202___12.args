a mac os user is less likely to be attacked than a windows user, but that is nothing to do with the level of vulnerability in the operating system.
when you install a program in unix, you typically predict which folders the executables and data will reside.
likewise, you might exploit a vulnerability in a third party application, as happened recently when abackdoor trojan embedded inside boobytrapped word documents successfully ran on macs.
even mr cluley's occasional barbed stabs at macs have only been mildly irritating when it is obvious that not running a "decent av system" in a business environment is just plain stupid.

join thousands of others, and sign up for naked security's newsletter filed under: apple, featured, malware, vulnerability last week, there was a lot focus on the security of apple macs after the russian security firm, dr web, revealed that they had found a botnet comprising overhalf a million infected mac computers.
windows users also typically update their software when an update is released by microsoft; they know updates mean that vulnerabilities may have been found, and it is safer to update than be exposed.
i fight windows malware nearly every day as part of my job so i am way more familiar with the stuff than i care to be.
it is my understanding that macs are definitely now becoming a focus of attention for the authors of malware exactly because they know that they are surrounded by this invulnerability culture and often left unprotected and so they can use them as carriers to inject malware into networks and other systems.
that’s thanks to built-in defenses in mac os x that keep you safe, without any work on your part.
you might run, for example, a piece of javascript that steals credentials, or a keylogger, without necessarily attacking the operating system.
those using windows have been aware for a long time that their systems have vulnerabilities, and so they are much more likely to use some form of protection such as anti-virus software.
so they windows xp inherited users, software and developers that assumed admin rights (i.e. the computing world's equivalent of crack addicts).

you're always less likely to get hit by cars if you check the road, just like you're less likely to get hit by malware if you check your system, no matter what os you're using.
xp is the successor of windows 2000 and windows nt, which definitely had a security model built into the operating system, including file system restrictions in ntfs to secure read/write/execute permissions.
certainly more sense than the idea your beloved fanboi os could have any security issues.
this most recent mac flashplayer virus was therefore still technically a zero day attack (no patch available) on macs, 42 days after the vulnerability was patched on "buggy and insecure" windows.
ffs most mac users long ago learned that the safest thing for their machines was a no micros**t policy, it removed risk & stopped the performance degradation & instability inherant to poorly designed and developed software from microsoft, who often seemed more intent on changing the macos to suit themselves rather than designing software for the mac (anyone remember the number of system extensions (& vulnerabilities) that installing word on os7 needed?).

anyone who has installed software onto a windows platform knows that the installed components can be placed in a wide variety of folders, the obscurity of which mean that if you were ever to attempt to unpick the installation manually you’d inevitably end up with some unwanted pieces of code on your machine.
a mac isn’t susceptible to the thousands of viruses plaguing windows-based computers.
microsoft also implemented the security development lifecycle program to train developers (their own and third-party) to bake security into the software development process from the very start.
apple has its part to play by releasing updates rapidly in response to known vulnerabilities, and users need to make sure they implement those updates as well asinstalling security software to protect against the coming threat.

my guess is that we'll see an explosion of mac infections as miscreants around the world upgrade their malware to use these latest exploit kits, seeking the newest technology and cool new features.

however, keep in mind that nothing is perfect, so be very careful of which websites you go to.
that they don't in fact sell at all.
i get everyone i know to install it, it's free, no longer slow downs your mac or interfere with normal operation and is great at helping me not pass on dodgy emails to my windows brethren !
reply david says: april 10, 2012 at 2:14 pm i bought a new pc and went online without virus protection.
unfortunately, apple’s implementation is not as advanced as that in windows, and hence it does not provide the same degree of protection.
the worst part in my job is dealing with systems people bring in because they "work from home" and it's our job to clean up those messes too.
fundamentally, there is no reason why macs should not be targeted using malware in the same way that viruses, trojans and worms are built to target windows systems.
of course i run anti virus software on a regular basis just in case.
apple has its part to play by releasing updates rapidly in response to known vulnerabilities, and users need to make sure they implement those updates as well asinstalling security software to protect against the coming threat.
reply john says: april 11, 2012 at 2:10 pm part of the problem is that the mac osx version of java is not supported directly by sun/oracle.
mikko hypponen, chief research officer at f-secure, put it very well when he said that, proportionally, the flashback trojan was as widespread amongst macs as the notorious conficker worm had been amongst windows-based pcs.
that wouldn't have added any words to the article - plus you could then have left out two whole paragraphs about windows not having file permissions, and unix having them built-in.
lets face it - all computer users need to stop being complacent and realise that av is essential.
windows users also typically update their software when an update is released by microsoft; they know updates mean that vulnerabilities may have been found, and it is safer to update than be exposed.
before i retired i worked for meteorological office defence services, who realised that people did work at home and either emailed or brought it into the office.
check your inbox soon, we've sent you an email.
don't show me this again sorry, something happened and we couldn't sign you up.
sorry, that email doesn't look right to us so we haven't added it to our list.
nt was wriiten from the ground up by dave cutler who was hired away from digital.
mac os users think their systems are somehow inherently “secure” and hence they are less likely to update as frequently as windows users, or to use tools such as anti-virus software.
"flashback would now have infected 1% of macs, making flashback roughly as common for mac as conficker was for windows" macworld.com/article/116625… mikko hypponen (@mikko) april 06, 2012
my guess is that we'll see an explosion of mac infections as miscreants around the world upgrade their malware to use these latest exploit kits, seeking the newest technology and cool new features.
i'd guess they don't even notice, and probably don't care since they've made their buck, and they can pass the responsibility on to the guys who have to patch the operating system to block a new exploit created by sloppy coders.
it will generally do that silently to avoid constantly nagging the user.
i've also disabled java applets in safari, as well as having the latest version of java.
even though nt implemented a security model similar to vms and unix (nt actually had a posix subsystem and currently supports an interix subsystem)
in less than 1 hour i was infected by a malicious site.
it's time to start laying blame where it really lies.
by default am antivirus system must download and install updates.
