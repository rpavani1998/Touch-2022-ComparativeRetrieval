mac os x mac vs pc welcome to free pc help, a pc help forum here to help you with your  computer problems.
what is your guys take on this?
as (again, i believe, but may be wrong) all the hardware is designed by  apple, it all just 'works' together much better, whereas with a pc, the  mainboard may be from one company, graphics card another... soundcard a  different one still, etc... not necessarily all totally compatible).
after all, no one knows everything and you may have the answer that someone needs.
i'm sure both  platforms will be around forever, and i guess that must be a good thing
the  biggest problem is the soft of course, what can you say when there is even no  decent file manager for mac (i mean like total commander), finder just beats  the Â£%$ out of me whats good about mac is that when you buy one, you buy  a computer that works, you dont have to worry about anything.
i must admit that as  soon as i get a bit stuck, i run to my laptop!

it's a good  platform for development and designing as well, yet the pc is no worse i think..

7- ultimate pc's are much better, esspecially security wise i have used both windows pc's, and mac's in the past and found  that even a free antivirus installed on a windows pc is better than a mac os,  even with their own security systems.
if you use linux at all, the command line stuff on mac is very similar, due to  being unix based (i believe, although tech guys, correct me if i am wrong!)
the os is a bit different, and will take some getting  used to * perhaps the worst con, is you will have to admit to all your  pc mates that you have joined 'the other side' !!!
three windows at the front and five at the back since i bought the house.
i am a hard core pc fan, so i would tell you everything  thats wrong with a mac but since your not a gamer, thats a different story.
another reason for few mac posts might be because of the percentage of ms windows computers in use compared to macs.
it might be that mac users would be more likely to go to centres of knowledge that are geared to them.

i currently use both, windows and apple for my work and
once you get used to them, they work really well, less clunky than many pcs *
this is from past incidents that have  happen to me or friends of mine.
hahaha * screens are high  quality on imac i feel, similar to iphones i guess!

this means the identifying, and deleting of the viruses is 100% effective and 120% more effective than a mac's security.
in terms of pros vs. cons, this is what i find (although it's just my  opinion!):
not alot of programs work on it and your can't upgrade most  macs if the need comes up.
macs until a few years ago were very hard to get help with and software too, but as people have stated it is getting better.
i think it be cool to have both a pc and a mac pc experience: very experienced operating system: xp home-windows 7 home premium tootech i deleted your post because i deleted the sollynaljesony post for adding spam.
that could be a reason why mac users wouldn't  post here.

more windows users would mean  more windows-based posts i suppose.
if you don't start  trying to tweak or change this or that in w.7, it will run your games, word  processors, spread sheets, art and photo programs or any other kind of software  you want to install.
