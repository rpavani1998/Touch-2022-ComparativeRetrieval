to be honest, in reality pcs are more expensive than macs in the long run, seeing as how you basically need to replace the pc every 6 months, and there is a greater risk of viruses and crashing.another downside to a mac, if you don't have software to make your existing internet connection work on a mac, you will have a hard time getting your mac fully operational.they are also user friendly, gorgeous to look at and to use.it's very user friendly…handles all updates on its own…i never have to worry about viruses and crashes…it's so comfortable to type on because the keyboard is slightly different from other laptops…the keys are more sunk in so there's less stress on your fingers.they have a really long battery life so you don't have to keep them plugged in all the time and they are made of recycled materials, i believe.there is also a decreased risk of viruses (the same way if you use linux).macs are so user friendly and well designed.the mac is faster, has better graphics and once you get used to it's system is more user friendly by far than a pc, most of it is just common sense stuff… the bottom line is that you have to see what you want to use the computer for, if internet use 100% you do not have to buy antivirus software and you would be pleased with lesser cost that way.however the mac's are more expensive to buy apps and software for but think in the long run they last longer and can be adapted to a wireless mouse and keyboard just like a pc and all the other whistles and bells that you want.there are some inconveniences (default programs/applications pc has that you'll have to download for mac), but it's very nice, and once you get used to it, you probably won't want to go back.the advantage to having a local place is you don't have to mail your computer somewhere, you take it in & they fix it when you have a problem.as others have mentioned, if anything happens to it, you will have to send it to apple care, but if you have a back up computer, it shouldn't be too much of an inconvenience.they are more versatile and you aren't constrained by brand.in addition to being a writer, i'm a professional photographer and artist so a big part of the appeal was having a dedicated graphic card (mid range one) and excellent graphics.and final reason, macs have a tendency to do better with the entertainment end of things (graphics, web-development, video editing, etc.)
