its the first ibm product called personal computer my linux desktops disagree.
(often i can't even salvage the case, because it's some strange configuration into which a generic motherboard will not fit.)
i'm the main tech support for my extended family who all used windows computers.
instead, apple merely traded places with acer, and pumped their share a little due to the largest lineup refresh in over a year.
yes, the macs do have the occasional issue but they are much easier to use and they rarely break down.
parent share twitter facebook the personal computer isn't locked down like that.
the other problem i see is that the people who want these macbooks the most tend to want them because they're cool, and thus will be more likely to want upgrades before five years is up.
in the 90s some macs came with a x86 coprocessor card, it was basically a pc in a slot.
pc makers have basically given up on the high end.

parent share twitter facebook apple does not sell servers.
apple doesn't force anyone to use osx.
among customers, too many have been bitten by dell and the like which could offer a cheap computer but will be filled with crapware and fail within 2 years.

acer went from over %10 of the us pc market to around %8, basically trading places with apple.

i'm free to change anything i want, i can run any app i want, and i can use my mac desktop any way i want.

the articles talking about the study used apple as an example, since they were the only major computer manufacturer who saw positive growth in unit sales in the quarter or two immediately after the recession hit, while the rest of the industry was seeing negative growth i understand this, but i submit that the rest of the industry would have been sluggish regardless, because hardware had overstepped the requirements of the software.
it probably has a lot to do with the fact that, in tough economic times, it tends to be the poor who suffer (the ones who would buy the cheapest pcs), while those with a lot of spare cash tend to carry on having [...] japan is 100 million (and you have to have advanced gadgetry there - cellular phones that cannot display tv broadcasts dont sell - that includes apple's iphoneshttp://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2009/02/why-the-iphone/ [wired.com] )
apple's customer base is relatively fixed, and that means that when the cheap-end of the pc market falters, their "percentage" of the market grows without needing any sales growth.
the difference here is that apple is likely to keep this spot because of gangbuster sales -- and, of course, acer's "there are no ipads in baghdad" strategy of depending way too much on netbooks and cheap notebooks.

the conspiarcy side of me says that there is a gigantic education bubble going on, all those 'graphic designers' need macs for their gubmint funded for-profit 'degrees in animation'.
pretty much every weekend i was cleaning up one computer or another, fixing both hardware and software issues.
we pretty much went all mac for all new purchases because of the great experience we have with apple computers and their excellent customer support.
as a matter of fact the virtual machine software on the mac can run windows from that dual boot partition or a more typical vm filesystem file(s).
fast forward to now, since the x86 macs, they can finally actually run ms-dos programs.
they were marketing some of their macs/powerbooks as if they could run ms-dos programs.
personally i'd prefer a thinkpad with linux if it could get past the corporate blockade that requires outlook.
without javascript enabled, you might want toturn on classic discussion system in your preferences instead.
