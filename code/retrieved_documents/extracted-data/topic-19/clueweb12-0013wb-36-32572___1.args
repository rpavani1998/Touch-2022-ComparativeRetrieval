the perfect mac "dream machine" for cad the other item which came up in reader's minds was the technical description of the "dream machine" for the mac compared to the pc magazine version.
adding a similar card to a yosemite (if there are any available for macs . . .) could easily take it over the $9,000 level.
one other correction is that the dvd video card is a daughter card that plugs into the ati 128 rage card, leaving a pci slot free.
with mac os x being similar to unix, some of these applications may be easier to port over to mac os x.
add to that the lack of mp systems and weak support from the likes of autodesk, maya, and avid, and macs look weak indeed.
the rage128 isn't even in the same league.
for example, the authors of pro-engineer, solidworks, microstation/j, and especially the parasolid kernel.
the number one thing to do is to not write apple about it (cc them, of course toleadership@apple.com) but instead write directly to the software company and tell them you want a macintosh version of their software!
part of the reason for the creation of the architosh website is to evangelize and inform macintosh users everywhere that the macintosh is a viable platform for cad professionals, especially architects, engineers and construction professionals.
in general adding an additional graphics card only allows you a second monitor capacity -- though it is possible to get this capacity with one graphics card in the pc space.
my company uses it, as do our most important customers [lockheed martin, u.s. army].
this discussion also talks about the usefulness of more graphics ram, as we were told by formac engineers.
we know this is a lot, this is a "dream machine" exercise only and many of the descriptions and choices we made could be scaled back to create the ultimate machine of your liking.

with more and more sales growth, unit growth and software developer faith and encouragement in apple, we can have our cake and eat it too -- someday.
one other correction is that the dvd video card is a daughter card that plugs into the ati 128 rage card, leaving a pci slot free.
this excludes macintosh from the equation, because neither pro-engineer, nor the parasolid kernel, nor microstation/j, nor solidworks is compatible."
he didn't say that the formac proformance chip is as a fast as a oxygen card with 96 mb of memory because that isn't probably possible.
if this is your situation, start letting those developers know that you want a mac os x version now.
two slow graphics cards are still slow.
another reader added this to the comments: "hello, you recently posted an article about pc magazine's "dream cad machine" and attempted to build an equivalent mac.
-reader without sounding too defensive, software was left out of the equation (and the price) in theprevious article not because there are so few choices in the macintosh market -- because that isnot true -- but because the article was really about the machine itself, the hardware.

he didn't say that the formac proformance chip is as a fast as a oxygen card with 96 mb of memory because that isn't probably possible.
they said that the market for such cards is probably too small but things could change.
these cards can easily top $2000.
add to that the lack of mp systems and weak support from the likes of autodesk, maya, and avid, and macs look weak indeed.
many readers simply said that sure the macintosh has great hardware specs and is easy to use and maintain but there simply isn't enough software for it (in the cad space that is).
as some readers put it: " hi... sure, the mac has great specs, but there's so few mac sw packages for cad!
"the problem is that many of the really good cad programs do not run on the mac
as much as i hate nt, apple cannot compete with it in the high-end without better products in hardware (mp g4s w/ slots) and software (os x consumer & third-party support).
with more and more sales growth, unit growth and software developer faith and encouragement in apple, we can have our cake and eat it too -- someday.
this reader is also correct about the fact that an ati rage 128 bit graphics card is not even in the same league as aoxygen card from 3dlabs (see our expo report on formac's permedia 3-based card)
we said adding an additional card, which doesn't really do anything for processing power at all, unless the two cards worked in conjunction somehow.
the high-end glint card has 96mb of ram and uses it all, rendering complex, high-res 3d images far faster than any mainstream cpu can.
in terms of hardware we need multiprocessing g4's, altivec-enabled cad and 3d applications and a company like formac to create an industrial-strength 60 mb plus graphics card based on the glint graphics chipset or something better.
as far as i know, autocad, the pc cad standard, still sells for around 3 grand per seat...
help support architosh by shopping at amazon.com thanks!
things can change and if you are interested in such cards with up to 96 mb of graphics ram then write to formac and ati and ask them about it.

in fact, the number of hits we received on the piece exceeded our previous best with our article on theautocad 2000 coming to mac os x rumor.
the mac os provides a far superior user experience, and mac hardware definitely kicks butt.
this reader is also correct about the fact that an ati rage 128 bit graphics card is not even in the same league as aoxygen card from 3dlabs (see our expo report on formac's permedia 3-based card)
we also do need some critical applications that are currently missing in the macintosh space.
the pc card you are comparing the mac to is most likely one of the oxygen cards from 3dlabs, based on a glint-family chipset.
vectorworks and denebacad, both of which work better on macs, start around 700 bucks...and the price differential grows as you add more seats..." - reader "the real-world disadvantage to the mac is not hardware based, nor is it os based.

no doubt, what good is a machine, no matter how bitchen fast and cool if the machine can't run those awesome cad and 3d applications you wish to work in?

we're going in the right direction, but mac users will discredit the platform if we pretend to be what we aren't right now."
however, a formac engineer told us that the permedia chipset uses a glint core in its silicon and has similar performance functionality at some levels.
clearly the mac is the best choice for most users on both fronts.
the "equivalent" mac opengl card you listed was a rage128-based 32mb pci card, which you admitted had less memory than the one on the "dream machine."
such a card would have to be a daughter card on the main graphics card to add additional graphics ram.
adding an additional graphics card and adding more graphic ram do different things.
on the other hand, what we learned is that the 32 mb ati rage nexus card is not the fastest card you can add to your macintosh.

formac, a german company who has been a longtime supporter of apple and the macintosh has come out with their latest128-bit proformance 3 graphics card and the claim is that it is up to twice as fast as the ati rage cards (to see comparisons click here).

two slow graphics cards are still slow.

let's try to solve that problem together by continuing to believe in the platform by purchasing more macs and macintosh software.

what we did was build a system from the choices in the apple store and then say, "what can we do to make it better?" the target price to compare with the pc magazine system was $9000.00 us.

you need to convince the industry leaders for high-end cad.
