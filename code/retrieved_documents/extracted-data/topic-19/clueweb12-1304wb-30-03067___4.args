haha i loved 19 hours 59 min ago nah, he couldn't pull it off 20 hours 3 min ago i realize, after listening 20 hours 10 min ago thank you, thank you.
producing music was very easy, just plug in and go, whereas i know someone who makes music on a pc and it seemed like a massive ordeal to get started, with software, compatability, speakers, sound cards, etc.
