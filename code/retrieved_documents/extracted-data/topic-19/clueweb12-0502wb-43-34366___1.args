either program lets you selectively turn off individual extensions or groups of extensions at startup time so that you can try and figure out what’s causing the problem.
in addition, don’t forget to check on any extensions you have installed, particularly ones that function as drivers for any hardware you’ve added to your mac.
so, the trick is to find an amount that lets you work without getting out-of-memory messages, but doesn't take more than necessary.
this can be very handy if you're working with large or complex documents because if the application doesn't have enough room to do its work, you may get an error message saying there isn't enough memory even if you have lots of ram installed and it's the only program running.
you can turn virtual memory on and off via the memory control panel.
you may also want to checkmacfixit, macintosh software & extension conflict troubleshooting, or other mac sites you see listed on mytroubleshooting resources page.
if it does turn out to be an extension-related problem, you’ll know you’ve found the problem when the mac makes it through the startup phase and brings you to the desktop.
first, do a normal mac startup and when you reach the desktop, go up to the apple menu and select about this computer (or about this macintosh or whatever the message on your machine happens to be) to see a display of how much memory each application on your mac is currently using.
finally, the last drawback of this arrangement is that if you’re using applications that can’t or don’t take advantage of the features offered by certain extensions, you’re wasting precious mac memory.
by the way, in addition to turning off certain extensions to avoid conflicts, you can get more memory for your applications by turning off extensions that you aren't regularly using.
make note of how much the mac os, or system, is using.
in most instances you'll want it on, but there are some older applications that won't work properly with it turned on, so you should check your mac's settings and adjust them as necessary.
the only time most mac users even become aware of extensions is during the startup, when the little icons representing different extension files dance across the bottom of your mac’s screen.
the article is a bit out of date, but you still may find it helpful if you want to find out about certain types of specific error codes.
however, it doesn't necessarily impact how much memory each application has to use, nor does it automatically increase the amount of memory allocated to each application as needed.
by placing these files into a special extensions folder inside the system folder, they are automatically loaded and run whenever the mac starts up.
by the way, if you have only one or two problematic documents, you can always just adjust the application's memory allocations--which is what these numbers are called--right before you work with them, and then change them as soon as you're done.
in some cases you may have to reset any adjustments you had previously made to the programs preferences or settings dialog box, but thats a small price to pay to get your application working again.
instead, the amount of memory allocated to each application is determined by an obscure setting in the application program's get info box.
finally, if all else fails, there are several excellent mac-specific troubleshooting resources available here on the web.
giving yourself enough room to work speaking of ram, another problem that can occur with macs is running out of memory.
in some situations, extension conflicts can keep your mac from booting at all.
however, feel free to create links to this, or any other page on the site.
if you do run across problems, bear in mind some of the previous tips, use some of the available resources and you should be able to keep your mac in top working form.
if youre still coming across type 11 errors on your power mac, you might want to readthis article (although updating to a current version of the macos would probably help as well).
by the way, in addition to turning off certain extensions to avoid conflicts, you can get more memory for your applications by turning off extensions that you aren't regularly using.
the article is a bit out of date, but you still may find it helpful if you want to find out about certain types of specific error codes.
now, restart your mac holding down the shift key until you see a message about no extensions (ill explain what this means in a bit) and when you get to the desktop, go to the apple menu again and select the same menu item.
if you enjoyed this article, you'll really like my book, "personal computer secrets."
in addition, some extensions step on each other’s toes by providing some of the same types of changes to the mac os.
if you increase both those numbers (they're often in kilobytes, so divide by 1,024 to figure out the amount in megabytes), you'll increase the amount of memory the application has to do its own work.
you can't change them while the application is open, but otherwise it can be done at any time.
thebasic troubleshooting article from the tech exchange, in particular, offers some great general troubleshooting advice.
however, it doesn't necessarily impact how much memory each application has to use, nor does it automatically increase the amount of memory allocated to each application as needed.
so, for example, a system with 32 mb that uses virtual memory might appear to the macos as having 64 mb of working room.
you can't change them while the application is open, but otherwise it can be done at any time.
conflict catcher lets you assign a hot key to launch it during startup
sometimes the issues are hardware-related (see the accompanying"mac hardware troubleshooting tips" for more), but most of the time they have to do with software problems.
you may also want to checkmacfixit, macintosh software & extension conflict troubleshooting, or other mac sites you see listed on mytroubleshooting resources page.
so, for example, if you have an extension file like adobe’s type manager, it adds its type-rendering features to the operating system as your mac starts up, and stays there as an "extension" to the operating system for as long as your mac is on.
as the above example shows, extensions can take up a lot of memory and turning off a bunch of them (or even sometimes just a few of them) may give you several megabytes of ram space back.
this mechanism consisted of files called extensions that could, well, extend or alter the features of the operating system.
(not all extensions have startup icons, by the way, so dont presume that because you counted 8 or 10 different icons during the startup, or boot, process thats all you have.
new computer viruses are being developed and unleashed at an alarming rate and even if you have the most recent version of an anti-virus program, you may still be at risk if the virus definitionswhich is what looks for and erases specific virusesarent current.
when apple designed the macs operating system they knew they wouldnt be able to provide all the features that people wanted, so they also built in a mechanism that lets mac users add to or extend the capabilities of the os very easily.
if you come across generic mac error messages that have specific numbers in them, you might be able to find more information about them inthis article from apples technical information library.
to get to extensions manager (which is actually a control panel), you can hold down the space bar while youre starting your mac, or choose extensions manager off the control panel submenu under the apple menu while your mac is already running.
theres no easy way to tell by simply looking at a preferences file whether it has a problem, but there is a simple procedure you can try if you suspect a problem.
now, restart your mac holding down the shift key until you see a message about no extensions (i’ll explain what this means in a bit) and when you get to the desktop, go to the apple menu again and select the same menu item.
the benefit of this arrangement is that any and all programs that run on your mac and need access to the features offered by the extension can get to them by interacting with the operating system, as they normally do.
this mechanism consisted of files called extensions that could, well, extend or alter the features of the operating system.
new application updates, operating system patches, and other types of upgrades are often the key to solving frustrating problems or just some annoying glitches.
the macintosh, on the other hand, is generally much less prone to problems and those problems that do arise tend to have more straightforward answers.

the reason is, once an extension has been loaded into memory it stays there and continues taking up space until you shut down your mac.
the downside, however, is that some programs dont operate correctly when used in conjunction with certain extensions or certain versions of specific extensions.
if you only make it part of the way through the startup process and then your computer freezes up, then thats the classic sign of an extension conflict.
