there is a terabyte sized hard drive that spins at 7200rpm which provides plenty of space for applications and data.what sets the mac pro apart from the imac is the fact that there are four hard drive bays and two optical drive slots meaning that the system has lots of internal expansion space that the imac lacks.those hoping to expand this out will find that it is limited to just 16gb of memory which is somewhat disappointing for a workstation classed system.those looking for higher performance have the option of going with the mac pro systems which have a more traditional desktop look but definitely not standard internals.with a retail price of $2500, it is possible to get an equally high performance 27-inch imac that comes with more base memory and a built-in display for $500 less.this is matched up with 3gb of ddr3 memory that under mac os x runs the system fairly well but for a performance machine is fairly limited.this is an older nehalem version of the workstation processor that has performance that would rank it very similar to the core i7-860 desktop class processor which a few differences that give it a slight edge.at $2500, the system is just too expensive compared to a similarly equipped imac.also included is a dual layer dvd burner for playback and recording of cds and dvds.it also features a dual-link dvi for older or non-apple displays.storage features on the base system are typical of a high end desktop.the big issue with the single processor version of the mac pro is the cost.user reviews write a review be the first to write a review related guide picks related resources - best performance desktops - best mainstream desktops - best 3d video cards - best 24-inch lcds - best 27 to 30-inch lcds related articles - desktop pc buyer's guide - what is raid?sure, the mac pro case is still one of the better on the market and has extra internal upgrade spaceuser reviews write a review be the first to write a review related guide picks
