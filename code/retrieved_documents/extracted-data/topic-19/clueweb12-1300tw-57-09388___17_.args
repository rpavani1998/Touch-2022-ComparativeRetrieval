they're honoring teachers, not only by providing them with technology that they canuse during class, but by recognizing and respecting successful teaching.it does have computer problems occassionally and requires maintenance, but it's all so very simple and easy.in fact, i often keep a lot of my personal documents on my usb memory stick and i can easily unplug it from my mac, plug it into any pc (well, any pc with winxp, since nothing else has the drivers built in -- not so with macs, they'll just go with it), and all of my files are there and i can open them all seamlessly.they're providing and empowering teachers withnew and innovative ways for teaching (using the ilife suite, for one).they suit our lifestyle, they'reconducive to creativity -- which is so much more than i could ever have said about my old pc.apple deserves our patronage for being the creative innovator.they're revolutionizingschool administration solutions.as ctlady said, everycreative professional uses macs simply because macsare creative and professional -- hehe, and innovative.they know how frustrating technology can be for teachers, but realize how today's kids are growing up asdigital kids.they are available -- there's dozens of very nice online mac sites that have comprehensive inventories of all the parts you could need.well, macs are good at graphics/publishing because creativity is needed.macs are expensive, that is another down-side, yet when you look at all the included software that comes included that costs extra on pc, it really balances it out.i am always amazed at what can be done on a mac and for the purposes of graphic editing and movie making, i'm very interested in a mac.it's little wonder they keeping winning awards for excellence in technology & learning.you can convert some files from mac to pc but not all and sometimes the files don't even look the same when you convert them.
