i don't regret getting a mac no matter how incompatible it is with programs like microsoft office–unless you're a student like me or run a business–compatibility might not be a problem for you.
year back july since switched from pc to my imac desktop computer and will never go back to the pc for using on the internet ever ever ever.
my computers have never had a virus.
i've had a lot of problems although i do like herbie and hope he ends up getting fixed.
so i bought a new one and got a free itouch and $100 printer credit.
i would say a pc… macs are more expensive, and they are so proprietary that pretty much have to take it to apple to get it fixed.
also, my mac is way more lightweight than my old dell was, so it's a lot easier to travel with.
i have always been a mac person they are so much better and easier to use.
this way you will be able to see/edit say word docs people have sent you.
as others have mentioned, if anything happens to it, you will have to send it to apple care, but if you have a back up computer, it shouldn't be too much of an inconvenience.
plus, the start up time is great.
when i had a pc i had a lot more problems with viruses, spyware, etc.
you won't be forced to shop from the mac store and pay their prices.
i have not had 1 virus, not had 1 time where the computer has crashed and have tons of fun with the software already loaded on the mac and there is so much more out there for different applications that cab be bought or downloaded.
a mac is a mac, but a pc can be any brand – which means if you need to upgrade, change something, etc.
i bought my desk top that i still currently use in 2005… and honestly it works fine, considering all the crap it’s been through, so i’ll probably keep it along with my laptop.
they aren't a huge chain so that might be a problem for you.
it's cheap (less than $600–you won't find a mac for that!), fast, and does everything i need it to do.
otherwise, you can get everything you need from a decent pc for a hell of a lot less cash.
that allows you to call in apple anytime without being charged.
it's a really hard choice – i love my pc, even though it is constantly getting annoying viruses.
mac's are supposed to be safer, but take a bit of time to learn how to use.
plus, if you have any questions you can always ask me.
pcs, though, are more user-friendly, i think.
i want something portable, long battery, but still relatively powerful and a mac ticks all those boxes.
it's so useful and it doesn't crash.
i never thought i would be a mac person because we had macs at school and they were always causing problems.
they have like a handful of viruses where pc's have hundreds of thousands.
we have macs at school and i don't like them at all.
no matter what you decide, enjoy picking out your new computer.
they are more expensive, but they hold their value.
it did not take long before i realized that used macs were going for prices very comparable to new ones.
however the mac's are more expensive to buy apps and software for but think in the long run they last longer and can be adapted to a wireless mouse and keyboard just like a pc and all the other whistles and bells that you want.
and it's really good to have because if you don't know how to do something or whatnot you can call them and they'll fix it for you in a couple of minutes.
i work on macs all day long and have both a macs and a pc at home.
it's cheaper and you can customize the speed.
ag having been there and done that i can tell you that if you have never used a mac and switch is going to be a bit of a, say, culture shock.
mac is better when it comes videos, pictures and writing too.
if it's a big deal to you, macs are pretty envionrmentally friendly.

i got an asus gaming computer for my oldest, and it's great, but it cost as much as a macbook.
my bf agrees, but he still prefers his mac.
so much easier to use and it has none of the issues i had with my pc (viruses, slow, heavy).
i'd do some research, find out what programs you need and stuff because like i said, unless you buy a package deal, everything is separate.
i bought acers for 2 of my kids, i've had to return them once as well.
i have a dell again, but only because i got a massive discount through my work (800 bucks off total…) but even then, i have still had to call them about 4 times in 14 months i have had this.
make sure if you go mac that you know how many mac-authorized service places there are near you.
i was informed by my special someone the other day, that he’d like to get me a laptop for christmas.
i only want a mac for scrivener and imovie, which are two amazing programs.
plus, they hardly get viruses or have problems.
i had a mac, ages ago and you can't use a lot of programs on it.
mac is a pro thing and it looks cute… for sure mac it's easy to do work where ever you want to.
i chose the non-glare screen because it's easier on the eye while writing for long hours.
although i'm challenged technology-wise, and both formats have given me their share of grief, i'd stick with the pc.
i've never had any problem with my mac and i don't worry about getting any virus!
the advantage to having a local place is you don't have to mail your computer somewhere, you take it in & they fix it when you have a problem.
as the previous posters pointed out: prettier (of course that doesn't really matter), fewer viruses, very user-friendly, and apple constantly comes up with fun techy stuff for their macs i have a pc at work and mac at home.
i asked out of curiousity what a new computer similar to mine would cost, it was about the same as a new mac.
there are so many great things about a mac, it's true, but pcs are just simpler.
while i do have a pc, it runs linux (configured it myself and love it!).
whereas, yes a mac in the short-run is more expensive, but over time, you actually save money with the mac, since you aren't constantly fixing or replacing it.
and one of the school computers also got a virus on it while i was using it (computers hate me), which is also supposed to be impossible for macs.
the graphics are really great and the operating system is soo much easier to use than windows.
apple also has great support from what i've heard.
and final reason, macs have a tendency to do better with the entertainment end of things (graphics, web-development, video editing, etc.)
i'm a pc user, but most all my friends have macs and they run well.
macs are so user friendly and well designed.
i just find them more easy to use.
at school we have mac ibooks and they are amazing to work with.
there is also a decreased risk of viruses (the same way if you use linux).
(i don't use it much, so i only notice the stuff that annoys me compared to my computer.)
if you play around with a lot of multimedia stuff (video and audio editing, mostly), then sure, get a mac.
another "downside' is that everything (ilife, iwork, etc) is all separate and unless you have a hotmail, yahoo, msn, etc email, you will have to pay for mac's email system.
the only complaint is that safari isn't compatible with all online sites, so i downloaded firefox, but that tends to freeze up more than i think it should.
and i know that if/when i want to upgrade, my computer will hold its value.
my pc is forever getting viruses that result in rebulding the harddrive, but my mac has never had a problem!
in addition to being a writer, i'm a professional photographer and artist so a big part of the appeal was having a dedicated graphic card (mid range one) and excellent graphics.
partially because the little experience i've had is not good.
we have several imacs, they work great, and the hubs has a macbook, it's at least six years old, and when we had a minor problem, apple fixed it and returned it right away.
i had to replace the screen once, the motherboard twice, the powercord about 5 times, the heat fan twice and the cd drive three times.
blogging with a mac is a bit different as well.
it wears off, sure, but from then on you do have to look out for compatibility issues.
i had to download the software for my internet on my computer for my brother's mac so he could access the internet so it could get the rest of the programming it needed to operate correctly.
i really really need that for school assignments and powerpoints, etc and mac's page app is not compatible with pc.
faster, no viruses, less clunky and easier to use.
they have a really long battery life so you don't have to keep them plugged in all the time and they are made of recycled materials, i believe.
sofware is much better than pcs, and they are also so cool!
if you can get someone to program it, i would suggest getting a pc and them programing it to run mac as well.
since then i have bought 2 other macs just just because i am kind of spoiled and had money burning in my pocket, not because any of them had problems.
but if you're going to keep your pc and it has all the window stuff on it, then you could get by without having windows on your mac.
it's very user friendly…handles all updates on its own…i never have to worry about viruses and crashes…it's so comfortable to type on because the keyboard is slightly different from other laptops…the keys are more sunk in so there's less stress on your fingers.
or, if you can't find someone to do that, i'd get a mac and run "parallels" even though that's just not as good.
over all i'm happy with how my programs run (compared to pc).
and software often comes out for the pc first, too.
apple makes a great computer that's super user friendly, but it does take time to get used to.
they are also user friendly, gorgeous to look at and to use.
i was an idiot & had no antivirus or anything else for a long time.
i'm so, so, so happy.
so, i would recommend getting an extended warranty on almost any laptop – much more fragile than a desktop – and if funds are limited, get a pc, and if money is not a concern, macbook.
i've had to return my gateway more often than i've had the thing working in the house, but it was inexpensive, so you get what you pay for.
we've been mac people for about 9 years and have never had a virus.
i'd go with mac since i'm guessing i have a pc.
like everyone said they do not get viruses as easily.
but, on the plus side, mac's crash a lot less and no viruses.
your tight on cash macs last a lot longer than pcs, in general.
also you have to spend close to $3000 on a macbook that is similar to a $700+ pc laptop.
if you're an art student, macs are better, but if not, get a good ol' pc.
having been there and done that i can tell you that if you have never used a mac and switch is going to be a bit of a, say, culture shock.
i have a macbook and i absolutely love it.
for sure mac it's easy to do work where ever you want to.
i had one for three weeks and it just crashed.
i was informed by my special someone the other day, that he’d like to get me a laptop for christmas.
while i like pcs, i definitely prefer macs.
if use microsoft a lot, you will have to get microsoft for mac.
if you are surfing the internet, writing, and playing games…stay with a pc.
however, it's not a mac world out there so the compatibility is very trying.
i'm a mac person and always have been one (except for office jobs).
i found it much easier to work with and navigate.
i bought my first macbook this summer, and was totally convinced i was going to get a great deal on ebay.
i just bought a macbook two weeks ago and am very much loving it.
so, my suggestion- a pc but not a dell, or a dell with a long warranty because then it covers basically everything, you just have to take the time to get it done.
if i was you, i wouldn't hesitate, buy a mac!!!
the battery life on a mac is great, so if you want to do a lot of work without being connected to your charger, get a mac.
another downside to a mac, if you don't have software to make your existing internet connection work on a mac, you will have a hard time getting your mac fully operational.
to be honest, in reality pcs are more expensive than macs in the long run, seeing as how you basically need to replace the pc every 6 months, and there is a greater risk of viruses and crashing.
i've been a mac for almost three years now and i will never go back to pc.
if you're new here, you may want to subscribe to myrss feed.
we got an imac almost 2 years ago and it is amazing.
i've only had my mac for a few months, but it's true love.
next minor difference: most laptops i've used have a mouse that you just tap & it clicks, on a mac you have to push the mouse because its a button.
the only issue is that there are programs that don't work on a mac, but there are a lot of ways to work around that so they work.
my only complaint is that i have trouble finding certain software for it because i don't have the money for expensive image editing programs.
i got my computer from a place called pc laptops.
so you will be able to switch back and forth between mac and windows.
well, i used both a pc (home) and a mac (school) while growing up and always found the pc easier to use.
so far, i've been working on a 46 second video for 4 hours and still can't get it working.
of course, the downside of macs are the prices (they are definitely on the pricier side), but it's worth it.
i'm making friends with people in vista forums.
there are some inconveniences (default programs/applications pc has that you'll have to download for mac), but it's very nice, and once you get used to it, you probably won't want to go back.
they are more versatile and you aren't constrained by brand.
i bought my desk top that i still currently use in 2005… and honestly it works fine, considering all the crap it’s been through, so i’ll probably keep it along with my laptop.
there are some really cool applications and it hasn't gotten a virus.
however, pc's are cheaper.
it's super-convenient and works a lot better and faster than parallels.
i can sell it and take that money and apply it to my new purchase.
i can hardly stand working on windows anymore.
as the previous posters pointed out: prettier (of course that doesn't really matter), fewer viruses, very user-friendly, and apple constantly comes up with fun techy stuff for their macs to have a choice on that matter?
the mac is faster, has better graphics and once you get used to it's system is more user friendly by far than a pc, most of it is just common sense stuff… the bottom line is that you have to see what you want to use the computer for, if internet use 100% you do not have to buy antivirus software and you would be pleased with lesser cost that way.
i would not trade my mac for a pc even if someone paid me!
i also got tired with all the virus the pcs were getting
they're great, and easy to use.
can and that way you can set it up in any room you want.. i hope this helps and whichever way you go happy new computering….. year back july since switched from pc to my imac desktop computer and will never go back to the pc for using on the internet ever ever ever.
can and that way you can set it up in any room you want.. i hope this helps and whichever way you go happy new computering….. you should get a mac.
if and when i get a laptop it will definitely be a mac.
i can't really say much about macs, though i have used them and when i did, i missed my old pc.
i'm thinking mac though, the build quality of the laptop is heaps better than most i hear and the battery life is great.
my husband can only use his old pcs for parts.
if on dialup or if you have high speed internet have to use a router on the ethernet plug in and the built in wireless airport for the router connection lets you do away with the cord connection just like a pc
if you're going to be doing something other than writing or going online, see if the programs you will be using are available for macs.
but after my pc was constantly getting viruses and finally crashed, i finally got my first mac (an ibook) 7 years ago.
i took it in, they cleaned it up, & it runs great again.
if you are doing video editing, home videos and that kind of stuff, go with a mac.
