no, most of that was enterprise/corporate solutions to integrate it apps like sap and oracle to mobile.
apple is the master at its user interface, but nokia has for example consistenly made far better cameras on its smartphones than apple.
nokia introduced tv out in 2006 meaning you could watch your pictures, websites, videos etc on your home tv.
the screen size is 3.7 inches, which is regressed from 4 inches on the e90 communicator four years ago.
in the emerging world market, where all the growth is now in dumbphones - nokia's market share is above 50%.
maybe 2 or 3 thousand just to have some spare capacity, but not a million per forest..
and elop himself defined ecosystems as they relate to mobile handsets in general and nokia explicitly, as: "ecosystems include not only the hardware and software of the device, but developers, applications, ecommerce, advertising, search, social applications, location-based services, unified communications and many other things."
and by its one form factor alone, it will not win many converts, but on the abandoned other form factors, and its lack of typical nokia elements, it is a downgrade from what nokia has been in the past, and yet is not competitive with rivals today.
it actually came from india, from the tata motors factory (the company that makes the cheapest car in the world).
microsoft has already admitted that it is true, if anyone sends a specific string sms text message (or fb message or tweet) to a microsoft phone based smartphone - it will shut down the phone and when the phone is turned back on, the messaging function is inoperable and the only fix is to wipe out everything stored on the phone - all messages, pictures, phonebook etc.
again, that does not end the need for pure excellence in real singing - witness uk singing sensation susan boyle what the digital convergence did, most of all, it dis-intermediated some players, and re-intermediated others.
so then we have the other stand-alone digital gadgets, like the advanced digital cameras by canon, nikon etc; or the portable gaming systems like the nintendos and playstatoin portables.
i also like the guidance by the mobilists and futurists, who look at the past decade, observe that mobile grew 10-fold in that decade, faster than any other technology of significant size - and then to argue that the same rate of growth would continue this decade, another full decade of growth of 10-fold.
we will know in a few days when nokia reports its q4 results.
nokia has easily the production capacity and the world's largest phone sales network and distribution system including the ability to air ship a million phones a day, every day, anywhere it needs to.
it does stumble as any handset maker will stumble (iphone death grip, anyone?)
welcome stephen and we wish you the very best of luck from here at the communities dominate blog - both alan moore and i have been regular advisors to nokia in the past, and we know you will be joining a great team of professional senior managers who take things strategically and with focus, yet constantly observing this industry - mobile - to ensure nokia understands how the landscape is evolving.
thus lumia will perform worse than nokia smartphones have done before.
and then the rep has to do the returns paperwork and packaging hassles.
amassive downgrade to what nokia used to have.
but consumers have not abandoned music.
for anyone who actually owns an iphone will not play long with the lumia in the store, before knowing the iphone is a far better buy (if you already are an iphone owner).
in countries where the average person has no hope of ever owning a car, the mobile phone is the nearest thing to a true status symbol.
it is a cheap copycat of the iphone style touch screen input and lumia abandons natural nokia strengths while showing no competitive advantages.
but after nokia jumps into bed with microsoft in 2012 the market share is not 20%, it will be.. 11%.in 2013 nokia and microsoft will not magically recover to 20%.
if you have 20 plants in your home, and really want this level of technology to monitor each plant, yes, we could quickly pass 50 billion subscriptions.
they try to erase the known unknowns.
no, the mp3 players will not be networked on the cellular network (mostly.
that is metering of our utilities.
and by its one form factor alone, it will not win many converts, but on the abandoned other form factors, and its lack of typical nokia elements, it is a downgrade from what nokia has been in the past, and yet is not competitive with rivals today.
motorola was so bad at it, that for about two years, for every one customer they convinced to 'upgrade' to a smartphone, they lost literally nine other previous motorola customers of dumbphones to either other branded dumbphones, or the new pure smartphone makers like apple, rim and htc.
technorati tags: ahonen index, ahonen index 2011, biggest companies in mobile, tomi ahonen almanac, tomiahonen almanac 2012 september 17, 2010 welcome stephen elop to best job in high tech: new ceo for nokia (first, its been a hectic week of travel for me, asia, north america, europe this week, so apologies for this blog being somewhat 'delayed'.
nokia is more like toyota or gm, where apple is more like ferrari or porsche.
yet the opportunities did not come from just fixed telecoms services like local and long distance calls and voicemail, or those enabled on mobile.
and recently the nokia shareholders have lost faith in nokia, comparing nokia's flagship model only, rather unfairly, to the apple iphone, and then concluding that nokia has somehow 'lost it'.
no, lumia will not do better than nokia did before with e-series on symbian and e-series on symbian is more microsoft-friendly and enterprise/corporate user friendly than lumia using windows phone.
but nokia has the world's best carrier partner network - if the carriers like the n8, it will become the planet's best-selling superphone, almost by default.
i do feel that olli-pekka kallasvuo got a 'raw deal' in how he was kicked out.
last spring and summer i often got caught up with the minutiae of the percentage in market share or the next user number in text messages or the latest added consumers to mobile, etc.
apple is the master at its user interface, but nokia has for example consistenly made far better cameras on its smartphones than apple.
no exploding batteries at nokia.
its about 'mobile' as the industry which is the ultimate convergence point and end-state for all digital convergence.
we can have our washing machine connected to the web (there are some that are sold already that offer internet connectivity).
nokia utterly dominates the new smartphone market too (and does it profitably).
nokia gave ever better phones with better features (e7, x7, n9) and the symbian os released ever better editions and the nokia ovi store became the second-bestselling app store and everything was improving at nokia.
reason 2 - camera catastrophy so lets go to nokia's second huge advantage against all competitors outside of japan and south korea domestic markets.
the basic phone is becoming a commodity product, and if we plot the price of basic phones with moore's law, by the end of this decade, a cheap cameraphone for africa will cost 1 dollar.
it was not designed by nokia's top designers from finland.
i based them not on my personal desires and preferences of what i like in my phones, i based it on the facts and stats of what real consumers do and want.
these four smartphone makers also make android smartphones.
remember, these customers do not have an internet to go do price-shopping.
the lumia 710 is yes, cheaper than the 800 but its still far too expensive to become any kind of mass market success (its price without subsidy is about 350 - 400 dollars).
this is how he phrased it "windows phone raised its middle finger at the carriers" and to make matters worse, even after that, currently "windows phone requires microsoft to push hard on the carriers" and the carriers do not like this at all.
olli-pekka kallasvuo, the disgraced previous ceo could have easily delivered 6.4 million sales of nokia's newest flagship and its os if given those parameters.
the company that invented the cellular telecoms industry - and launched the world's first mobile internet service, ntt docomo of japan believes so strongly in mobile advertising, they created d2c the world's biggest pure mobile ad agency.
it also sells apps, services, and networking gear.
bluetooth file transfers, microsd cards, these are absolute must-haves where there will be no practical use or indeed network connectivity to use microsoft's skydrive.
they do have mobile phones but ones that cost under 50 dollars, often as cheap as 20 dollars new.
and obviously, local developers can offer local apps in their home languages!
if the iphone was sexy and slick, and the nokia was more bulky and unsexy, at least the nokia had every conceivable tech built in, and several more you didn't even know existed.
the nokia of old was a profit factory.
thats the 4th major smartphone player, and the third of fortune global 500 rivals to quit the smartphones race.
this would be a painful change, but nokia has done that many many times before - it once made paper.
they still spend about 30 billion dollars on it annually, only the traditional music publishing industry is getting an ever smaller slice of that.
and in many of the less affluent countries on that list, even radio does not reach as widely as mobile phones.
and even those who will use it, will probably not need it for all plants.
whatever you thought of ovi and symbian 'failing' in apps, it is far worse on windows phone.
and all the evidence says nokia lumia sales in q4 were a total disaster.
and we know the decorations are not genuine nokia - the operating system and apps (the paint job).
that guarantees that any current owners of nokia will find the lumia a severe disappointment.
if the internet itself is headed to mobile, the salvation for a bookseller or video or music or travel company is not to go online, it is to 'leapfrog' the technology gap and go directly to mobile.
three times the effort for zero more commission - while the customer bitches and moans and gives the sales rep a bad day.
to do that requires a step change in learning and self-improvement – this is achieved through continuous contemplation and self-reflection which ultimately enables the mastery of an aware self/organisation, with the motivation to pursue truly motivated goals.
but for some consumers - remember this is only the 7th most important priority - they have their 'check lists'.
so then lets move from animals to plants.
trees won't get us there either.
and in the uk, nokia was the phone brand with the highest loyalty (not the iphone or blackberry which were a lot in the news for big market gains).
or take the global internet and all its revenues out of google adwords and broadband fees etc, all of the internet revenues - and multiply that by 20.
no straight lines presents a new logic and inspiring plea for a more human centric world that argues we now have the possibility to truly transform our world, to be more resilient, to be more relevant to us both personally and collectively, socially cohesive, sustainable, economically vibrant and humane, through the tools, capabilities, language and processes at our fingertips.
this is our biggest number and we do need to pump it as much as possible to get us to the 50 billion.
mobile data is worth 250 billion dollars.
if you don't know the history of how devastating microsoft has been to its 'strategic partners' in mobile, like the vampire, its bled them dry.
the worse assumption is that all 8 billion sold gadgets are still used by the end of 2020.
apple surrendered to nokia and now pays nokia not just for every iphone made, but apple also paid a lump sum to compensate nokia for the patent infringements of early iphones.
the population of the planet keeps growing.
more likely, today consumers have so many ways to get music by sideloading and on free music services, that it won't matter one iota.
a huge support system was in the recording industry to produce the sound of the music, to produce the cds, to ship them to music retail stores, and to use the radio stations, music video tv stations like mtv, and promotional concert tours to help promote the album sales.
informa counted that the world had  67 million people with a mobile banking account.
the first point to make, is that the author, e.d. kain, had actually written a pair of articles about windows phone, this one yes in favor butalso another one against.
thirdly, please allow me some more clumsiness and brevity and even more meandering in my writing style this time in this blog article, as i am back from vacation and heavily travelling and super-busy, so i wanted to get my thoughts out sooner, rather than try to find the time to refine and edit this blog down some more.
the tech reviews after using windows phone (and lumia) are quite consistent that windows phone is not yet ready for prime time.
pakistan, egypt, bangladesh, vietnam, turkey,ovi ovi ovi... nokia's ovi store supports over 50 languages!
this is what i found: reason 1 - messaging madness: nokia has a natural strength in messaging-oriented smartphones (the most used feature of all mobile phone owners from africa to the usa is messaging, including smartphone owners).
(check out where the leading forecasters now estimate lumia sales for q4.
portable multimedia players including dvd players sell 130 million.
we hear of some great successes - more than half of helsinki area public transportation single tickes are sold via mobile, and all of parking in estonia is mobile, and now more than half of all banking accounts in kenya are mobile banking accounts.
some of that was due to the global economic downturn (remember, 3 of its rivals in the big 5 handset makers reported losses in their handset business during this economic crisis - nokia never did.
regionally, the biggest companies of our industry are now split so that 9 come from europe, 9 also from asia, 6 from north america and 1 from latin america (but if you want to count mexico as part of the north american continent as separate from the cultural division then 7 are from the north american continent).
if you buy the 2011 edition now, you will receive both almanacs for the price of one.
its about 'mobile' as the industry which is the ultimate convergence point and end-state for all digital convergence.
he said because carriers have explicitly decided to support android rather than windows phone - "that is why windows phone has not sold as well".
in m-money it is very early going.
if the iphone was sexy and slick, and the nokia was more bulky and unsexy, at least the nokia had every conceivable tech built in, and several more you didn't even know existed.
and here again, nokia has the biggest production capacity.
the other big us carriers are not selling any lumia handsets this spring.
3 mobile subscriptions per person (not inconceivable, i for example walk around daily with 3 subscriptions, have done so since 2003).
remember, the old windows mobile was built to be business-oriented (as was symbian originally).
the office suite and some of its components like word, excel and powerpoint are clear market leaders in their fields.
but mobile will not enable our air travel.
nokia has a history of truly exceptional feel to its top phones.
some of us of a certain age have piles of kodak slides and snaps, even old kodak cameras around the place.
a lot of finns have migrated to canada, so there is a kinship too, probably most canadians know at least someone who has finnish heritage.
i made the joke speaking in toronto this week, that finland has just appointed its first-ever canadian vice prime minster - arguably the ceo of nokia is perhaps the second most powerful man in the domestic finnish economy haha..
that is nokia excellence in cameras.
except that the job at nokia in 2010 is actually far better, and far more than those three giants even, two decades ago!
the smartphones were competing with many other nokia smartphones already in the stores, so they faced competition from nokia's own product line.
we know from global consumer surveys what people do on their phones, and what consumers look for when buying smartphones.
whatever we think of the smartphone buyer in the world, the target customer for potentially 4 out of 5 buyers of smartphones, the consumers, their number 1 interest is sms text messaging.
before search engines, it was not practical to try to find 'all available information' on a given topic, unless you lived next door to a major library like the us library of congress and were a wiz at using the library's card catalog system - and then spend hours digging through book indexes and tables of content.
if microsoft was the magic potion - surely nokia should have been able to capitalize on it in 2009 and 2010 before elop decided to set his platforms on fire like the psychotic arsonist.
we've had full mobile payment solutions in the philippines for a decade already.
if you thought the nokia of the past was 'obsolete' for your market, whether that was the usa or europe or asia-pacific or wherever, this lumia line offers you nothing that is better but on ten separate factors, lumia is now worse than what nokia was last year.
whatever nokia was able to do in 2010, today nokia will do far worse, whether in the usa or rest of the world.
i did suggest this would be a bloody year for smartphones but honestly i didn't expect this many casualties.
it was just routine, supported with no particular marketing effort.
except that the job at nokia in 2010 is actually far better, and far more than those three giants even, two decades ago!
the most trusted, most desired, most valued and loved brand.
in japan the mobile wallet is the most advanced where it not just includes your banking and credit and payment and loyalty cards.
nokia ceo stephen elop is once again acting in the best interests of microsoft, and against the best interests of nokia.
then yes, most definitely, microsoft and nokia are in the game and can certainly be believed, that they can win this game.
how awesome is that for mr elop, he gets the media attention for being the new guy, and he has a wonderful story to tell, where he does not need to 'fix nokia' but rather just elaborate clearly what nokia is doing.
but yes, adding cars, we're at 21.4 billion so far.
he finds a genuine nokia asset where nokia was years ahead of the rivals - like now with mobile advertising - and rather than fix that unit's execution to deliver massive profits for nokia, he prefers to sell it.
regionally, the biggest companies of our industry are now split so that 9 come from europe, 9 also from asia, 6 from north america and 1 from latin america (but if you want to count mexico as part of the north american continent as separate from the cultural division then 7 are from the north american continent).
so the nokiasiemens networking unit has been fighting a brave fight in a loss-making industry and turned it around to generate modest profits - that is a very good sign of good management.
the nokia brand damage is recent and perhaps reversable but microsoft's brand damage with windows mobile and windows phone has been sustained far longer and been far more comprehensive.
and yes, a fraction of nokia's total phone output is smartphones, and this year the revenues out of smartphones roughly speaking match the total revenues of the dumbphones.
the third point raised by forbes is that with windows phone there will be uniformity across devices.
if stephen elop can deliver 6.4 million lumia sales in the past q4, i am willing to say in public, i was wrong, he is competent to manage nokia and i will accept he's made some mistakes that should be forgiven as learning on the job.
this selling of the mobile advertising unit is how nokia's new ceo indicates"accountability and leadership".
so says comscore in 2011 - said 83% of europeans and 68% of us phone owners sent sms text messages.
this must be lumia's big market and tomi is a total fool to not see it.
i had already given my view of apple's strategy in smartphones which i wrote during my summer vacation.
if you don't trust them europeans and want the pew picture, we have that too.
analysys gave the q2 market shares for china in 2011 and nokia had crashed in one year to.. 22% with samsung and motorola
nokia has the carrier relationships to turn a good phone into a big hit and the n8 seems to be very well poised to do well.
the elop effect collapsed the nokia smartphone sales globally, not only in the affluent countries but also in the emerging world countries.
motorola reported a surprise profit in its handset division, but that was a one-time gain out of a lawsuit settlement with rim.
and google are not alone among internet giants believing in a mobile future.
and in 10 times out of 12, the carrier will not offer the lumia which the customer would want.
apple is a classic premium luxury niche maker, who can hope to have 3% of the market - like it has with the macintosh pc, after 26 years of fighting those battles with its 'revolutionary' pc.
so the telecoms industry itself is migrating to mobile, no surprise anymore
(note this does not include the ultra-cheap dumbphones that use the even simpler nokia s30 os, by which nokia's total reach was last year estimated at about 1.7 billion)
and the ceo who thinks its a war about ecosystems, and believes that advertising is a key part of ecosystems, doesn't want to keep nokia's competitive advantage here, one that nokia years ahead of its rivals in discovering and exploiting?
the lumia 900 and lumia 800 do look like flagship phones and have won plenty of praise, copying nokia's radical look of the n9 from last year.
executive summary i know this is a painfully long article for most to read.
he will be seen to have saved symbian and nokia in the process..
if the market is big, and there is money to be made, then application developers will cope with the fragmentation.
the digital convergence may be making the difference between the average musician and superstar even greater - a madonna or rolling stones can command astronomical fees, but the average starting rock band probably earns about the same per 'gig' per night, adjusted for inflation, as rock bands did in the time of the beatles and elvis 50 years ago.
so 2 phones per person are not enough.
not so often the actual inventor (japan's ntt docomo has most true inventions in the mobile space), but being the fast follower, nokia was well picking winning concepts (cameraphones, consumer smartphones) but made its stumbles too (n-gage).
the poorer people didn't suddenly all - billions of them - receive massive pay rises.
yes, its share price has taken a battering recently, but even then - in the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, when all rival giant global handset makers stumbled, nokia came through with flying colors, its handset unit profitable every single quarter.
i am not suggesting that all nokia carrier relationships were in good condition.
if thats not enough for you, there is the microsoft marketing machine.
windows phone 7 doesn't even support dual cameras (that came with 7.5).
there is a second technical manufacturing problem already admitted by nokia .
they do not read tech magazines with product reviews and contrasts and recommendations.
he actually hired an outside company, compal of taiwan, to manufacture the lumia smartphones!
roughly a quarter of all cars in south korea are already connected to the internet.
so we can say that in 13 years, mobile has already cannibalized over a third of the computer market.
reason 3 - look and feel is not competitive.
a lot of finns have migrated to canada, so there is a kinship too, probably most canadians know at least someone who has finnish heritage.
they are very aware who is who and who plays naughty and who plays nice.
the article got a lot of attention and on first read, to the random reader, it seems to make good arguments (i will deal with those later).
yes cnn's smartphone app was available on the ovi store.
nokia cultivated the partnership model with its app store, ovi, and its content and its networked services such as maps, advertising, mobile payments etc.
the look and feel will be above average definitely but not on par with the top phones by the rivals.
i am not suggesting that all nokia carrier relationships were in good condition.
nokia voluntarily foregoes a competitive advantage that it has always before taken advantage of.
olli-pekka kallasvuo, the disgraced previous ceo could have easily delivered 6.4 million sales of nokia's newest flagship and its os if given those parameters.
focus on mobile, so they have not abandoned the opportunity in digital convergence).
there is very much more in the article including aspects that are particular to the emerging world (where half of all smartphones are now sold) and issues to such matters as build quality - microsoft and nokia have already admitted to two production quality problems with lumia.
if the lumia sales in q4 fall under 4 million, the signs are undeniable that lumia's path is a dead end, a cul-de-sac, and the sooner nokia board sees this, the sooner they must terminate all activites that waste resources pursuing that route.
nokia had a 5 megapixel camera when the iphone was introduced with only 2 megapixels.
its only loss of the past decade was one quarter during this economic crisis, when the nokiasiemens unit's losses were bigger than the profits made in the handsets unit.
it may be to microsoft's advantage that the customer doesn't buy a meego or symbian based smartphone - but that customer will then go to another brand - and in 9 times out o 10, it will be either an iphone or an android.
so mobile can only influence a small part of the travel experience, whether in airplanes or hotels or trains etc.
there are three major business units at nokia which derive most of the revenues.
and nicely on que, forbes ran an article of thefive reasons why windows phone will make big splash in smartphone market.
i think the 3 mobile subscriptions per person concept is not really viable for the whole global population.
even in the big growth stages of the android now, symbian has lost only a little, still selling more than 4 out of every 10 new smartphones this year - where microsoft's windows mobile and palm have all but disappeared, and apple's iphone took big losses the past few quarters.
that to me speaks excellent management in very difficult conditions.
we may get some millions of connections, but this math won't even start to work until we look at billions, or at least major fractions of billions.
and nicely on que, forbes ran an article of thefive reasons why windows phone will make big splash in smartphone market.
nokia is one of the giants of that business too, which is not well known, as it is a b2b (business to business) type of enterprise.
no wonder that 'do no evil' google is getting global support everywhere.
it does stumble as any handset maker will stumble (iphone death grip, anyone?)
so, in a perfect world, nokia could sell 3 handsets on four networks ie 12 variations for the consumer.
apple brought a new era to pcs (but was unable to capture a major part of that new world).
the usa relationships were particularly damaged.
htc, microsofts' longest-serving smartphone partner was so upset with microsoft, it refused to support the final version of windows mobile and now strongly prioritizes android.
for some buyers a camera is more important.
the customer knows far more accurately what is true value.
it bought siemens's giant but loss-making networking unit, and turned it around and now nokiasiemens networks makes some profits, in a sector of the industry where profits are very rare to see.
of the portable digital gadgets, with the 8 billion number.
so if you thought that perhaps the internet was threatening your business, that may be a short-lived threat, say for industries already feeling the full threat like bookstores or video rentals or music stores or travel agencies etc.
if the ecosystem is tiny, no matter how uniform it might be, if the market size is too small, they won't care.
vodafone pulls plug on 360 smartphones i did suggest this would be a bloody year for smartphones but honestly i didn't expect this many casualties.
rather than nokia's own-designed mobile-optimised and smart os platforms, symbian and meego, this fraudster uses an os that was never designed to any degree by any nokia programmers.
in my journey in writing no straight lines, i have seen this organisational myopia as a constant red thread.
the new ceo inherits a powerhouse mobile phone maker giant, which is on solid foundations, well positioned to reap benefits of the economic upturn, and well poised to capture a disproportionately large share of almost any conceivable mobile phone industry opportunities that can currently be seen on the horizon, including all flavors of smartphone opportunities from superphones to app stores.
i am not in any way suggesting that all was perfect at nokia when elop took over.
the joke was, that to see what will be on the next iphone model, just look at a 3 year old nokia flagship.
it may become that one day, but it is not competitive yet.
no cracked screens at nokia.
reason 9 - deficient operating system the windows phone 7 and 7.5 operating systems do look cool and sexy when shown on stage or briefly demo'ed.
nokia was the first company to boldly claim that the future of phones was smartphones (a view still found controversial to many today) and more brazenly, nokia was the first company to say a smartphone was a computer (something ridiculed by the 'real' pc makers at the time, and only very recently the pc makers - all 6 of the 6 biggest pc makers in fact - have all found it to be true, that a modern smartphone is indeed a 'real' computer, only a tiny and pocket-sized one).
perception problem against this light, nokia is 'accused' of 'failing' because of three major faults.
we saw it with the ovi store, we saw it with nokia developer relationships, we saw it with mobile commerce and nfc (the lumia series does not support nfc while nokia's own meego and symbian both of course do support nfc).
the last vestige of nokia strongholds - its superb build quality - is now jeopardized and indeed, first evidence of problems already not just reported - but acknowledged by microsoft and nokia!
if you want the lumia 900, you can only get it on at&t.
that poisons the reputation both for friends recommending smartphones and the sales reps at the stores.
both microsoft and windows are very powerful brands for us.
and nokia does not do colossal mistakes.
on the n9 using meego nokia was able to innovate with touch screen inputs.
i counted on this blog that if we add both the traditional pcs including desktops and portable computers, and the smartphones, we get atotal market size of 465 million units for 2009.
yes, about half of south koreans and the japanese have mobile digital money enabled phones and services, but its nowhere near yet where half of their economy would transit the phone, and they are the most advanced digitally converged nations.
real player was standard on nokia phones still last year and most rivals support the file format.
and obviously, after even apple added videocalling support to the iphone 4, essentially every rival (not using wp7) does videocalls.
what are the profitable opportunities in mobile for a phone maker.
in a very rough term, we can expect that the mobile phone subscription penetration rate globally will pass about 120% human population per capita during this decade (at least).
that gives us 560 million connected pets.
htc, microsofts' longest-serving smartphone partner was so upset with microsoft, it refused to support the final version of windows mobile and now strongly prioritizes android.
nokia was a juggernaut profit factory, selling the world's most widely adopted gadget (the mobile phone) utterly dominating that space and doing it profitably.
and yes, i do believe in dramatic growth to come in mobile, so i am all for the expectations to be big.
the reality is that recently the iphone market share has been declining (four quarters in a row) where nokia's market share held steady or actually grew.
so just to compare apples to apples, the new operating system launch led by the new flagship phone, lumia 800, would need to sell 6.4 million copies in the past q4, only to match what nokia did a year ago.
so doing your microsoft business solution is far better on a symbian e-series phone than with windows phone!
nokia was very good also at keeping to its vision - not for example taking the populist view from 2006 that flip phones would take over the world (anyone remember the razr).
because of that, nokia can't even start to ship low-cost smartphones until the second half of this year at the earliest (if microsoft manages to deliver on time).
the chief executive officer of nokia had lost the trust of the owners of the company, and therefore, could not really sustain the trust of the board either.
pakistan, egypt, bangladesh, vietnam, turkey,ovi ovi ovi... nokia's ovi store supports over 50 languages!
but it will help create some image of stephen elop as a miracle maker if analysts a few years later start believing a legend that elop came to save nokia and in doing that, he defeated apple's unstoppable gains in smartphones.
similar stats come from all around the world and obviously nokia's own reported smartphone unit sales tell the same morose tale.
while mass market consumers are usually blissfully ignorant of the backstabbing in the corporate world of partnerships, the carriers/operators are not.
they are bulletproof.
on the n9 using meego nokia was able to innovate with touch screen inputs.
where nokia smartphones tended not to be the coolest and sexiest in recent years, at least nokia was always known for stuffing every conceivable tech feature onto its flagship phones.
this damage is not only the world record crash of market share of any mobile phone handset maker.
the measured sales are worse than that.
and the ceo who thinks its a war about ecosystems, and believes that advertising is a key part of ecosystems, doesn't want to keep nokia's competitive advantage here, one that nokia years ahead of its rivals in discovering and exploiting?
they were involved in the first mobile battle of convergence, what i called the 'battle for the pocket' in my second book m-profits in 2002.
bluetooth file transfers, microsd cards, these are absolute must-haves where there will be no practical use or indeed network connectivity to use microsoft's skydrive.
the camera industry boldly and bravely (and foolishly) thought mobile phone based cameraphones would never catch on, and never rival their industry.
the computer industry is headed to mobile.
a few of the 7-8-9 year olds perhaps, but thats not enough to push us far above current 6.8 billion level, in particular that for those few of the eldest in this group, we then have to balance out those elderly people who will be dying in this decade.
understand that even in 2013, symbian will utterly tower over windows phone in installed base.
in practise, its banking and credit cards when considering the classic major financial industries, or digital money in a technical sense (insurance is also going to join the mobile revolution a bit later).
elop could decide how and where to introduce the actual models to the public, how near or far from the commercial launch date.
nokia could have given us great feel on the mechanics - where nokia excels far above all other handset makers.
nokia introduced this fantastic feature on the n900 in 2009 (note, yes, read thumb drives and other usb memory devices including portable hard drives making the smartphone behave just like a real laptop).
we saw it with the ovi store, we saw it with nokia developer relationships, we saw it with mobile commerce and nfc (the lumia series does not support nfc while nokia's own meego and symbian both of course do support nfc).
regardless, it is patently obvious thatmicrosoft relationships with carriers were bad before and are getting worse with windows phone.
but nokia has the world's best carrier partner network - if the carriers like the n8, it will become the planet's best-selling superphone, almost by default.
we can book our seat and pay for the ticket and get a boarding pass to the phone, but we still need an airplane to burn jet fuel to fly from one airport to another.
for me the real frustration is watching companies career into oblivion, which also reminds me of the opening words from no straight lines.
i am always talking of real prices, not the bogus prices of bundled contracts with handset subsidies.
nokia had the best carrier relationships in the world.
but these gadgets are relatively expensive, and there is no point in paying for their cellular connectivity for the 20 to 30 year life that the tree spends growing to full size before it is felled.
forbes said windows phone would have less patent wars.
note that while apple's iphone is a one-trick pony, and only sells a touch screen super smartphone - nokia keeps selling in similar quantities of touch screen smartphones across all its product lines.
it did not set the world on fire, the gaming side.
note this growth was not that smaller 'newcomers' making smartphones had 'grown' into the global 500.
that diminished - but did not eliminate - the role of the traditional music studio for creating music.
and this amazing transition they have done - consistently - while making the best profits of any big phone maker.
nsl store posted by alan moore at 06:37 pm in bloodbath, books, carriers / operators, convergence, elop, nokia, strategy | permalink | comments (22) | trackback (0) technorati tags: crisis, disruption, innovation, kodak, mobile, nokia, photography, technology there are 6 challenges i believe that organisations have to navigate to thrive in a non-linear world.
with the language support, the ecosystems nationally around the carriers and nokia grew meaningful in many cases.
bright ferrari red, the prancing horse logo and all.
with symbian at low-cost smatphones, nokia had conquerred the world.
that doesn't matter, we now have an ex microsoft executive,
cloudtalk surveyed us smartphone owners in july and found 71% used sms and only 40% used the mobile web (they didn't ask about apps).
if the customer wants a specific model, and that is not sold by that carrier,the facts tell us that the smartphone customer would be willing to buy another lumia or even another nokia smartphone - except that because of management madness, there are no others.
just one - one - ringing tone - sold half a billion dollars - in paid downloads to mobile phone users - in one year - three years before apple even opened up its app store.
people at nokia talked about a multimedia mobile computer, but it couldn’t look beyond those 12 keys.
no wonder that 'do no evil' google is getting global support everywhere.
there also are many other industries that are seeing impact from mobile, but who are unlikely to be totally cannibalized by mobile.
but please read the full analysis: lets start with consumers smartphones (invented by nokia four years before the blackberry) first were enterprise/business tools.
the perfection in the camera shutter on the n93 or the precision of the hinges on the e90 communicator or the sheer delight of engineering bliss that is the slider/folder motion in the e7.
even the inventor of sms, matti makkonen finished his career at nokia (he was my last mentor).
if you seriously think that there is a trend to apps in the phone business, then yes, nokia saw it long before the current hysteria, and had built its app offering and business systematically.
its easy for many in banking and credit cards to be fooled into thinking this tsunami wave of convergence will not hit their shores.
the third biggest factor for smartphone buyers in the emerging world, far ahead of apps or the os, is the network provider ie the carrier ie mobile operator.
it was just routine, supported with no particular marketing effort.
those are not my numbers, they are morgan stanley's numbers and they are the first analyst house to dare to make a projection on the nokia-microsoft partnership.
lets see how strong the windows brand is in smartphones.
nokia very literally scared away six out of every ten customers it had a year ago.
rather than sell ad unit, why not allow sales of n9 what i cannot understand, is if nokia is in the business of selling mobile phones, and its most profitable smartphones are currently onthe undersirable lumia brand (where sales representatives at stores find that in 11 cases out of 12, a customer who buys a nokia branded smarthpone refuses to take a lumia) and thehighly desirable meego platform (where sales representatives find that one in four customers who buys a nokia smartphone, will buy an n9 which uses the meego operating system) - why is elop not willing to sell the n9 (and its sister phone the n950) in every market!
stephen elop is an excellent communicator but he seems to be a systematic liar.
luckily elop has seen the error of his way and now starting with the lumia 710 the practise is ending, but there are still phones in the pipeline that don't allow battery changes - like the lumia 900.
we've heard the internet people like google and yahoo say that the next internet is mobile; and in the countries where the internet is already fully mobile (south korea, japan etc) they say the next internet is in the car.
maybe that is not a big surprise, they have been predicting the pocket computer for two decades already.. the media industries are more interesting.

if you walk into the store with the apps as your decision criterion, then windows phone fails from the start.
so while nokia had every chance to gain an advantage on the look side, it voluntarily abandoned about half of the total market potential.
i do feel that olli-pekka kallasvuo got a 'raw deal' in how he was kicked out.
and when kodak finally did embrace digital in 1993 it did with hesitance that comes when companies are afraid to cannibalize their existing businesses for the sake of the future.
they are so poor they don't even own a radio receiver.
blackberry is collapsing in consumer sales in the usa, yes, that is true (but growing internationally) but the enterprises are replacing their smartphones rather loyally, berry by berry.
there is no slot for any kind of memory card which is regressing from the microsd slot in the n8 that supported 32 gb memory cards.
the 'talent scout' at recording companies (the big labels) is a job that is disappearing.
(for us readers, remember, a 'free' iphone 3gs on 2 year contract is not a free phone.
so nokia lumia trades the best carrier relationships to bad ones, and then partners with the company with the worst relationships - that has been making them only worse last year.
but that is rare and would take years of competence to develop by the bookstore owners, and still would not be nearly as powerful as the amazon recommendation engine, in pinpointing exactly what kind of books i may like.
in japan the mobile wallet is the most advanced where it not just includes your banking and credit and payment and loyalty cards.
no, most of that was enterprise/corporate solutions to integrate it apps like sap and oracle to mobile.
if the internet itself is headed to mobile, the salvation for a bookseller or video or music or travel company is not to go online, it is to 'leapfrog' the technology gap and go directly to mobile.
if lumia fails to sell 4 million copies in q4, it will be so comprehensively rejected that nokia cannot revive it.
but as the mass market vanished, the mass market business also shifted.
the (former) director general of the bbc said that all broadcast content will be available on mobile (and bbc's successful iplayer is a perfect example of how a broadcaster can take a big slice out of the digital convergence into mobile).
in some of the more affluent markets on the above list, most households do have tv sets like in china and russia.
the original symbian os which powers nokia's smartphones was not designed for touch screen inputs.
considering how heavily smartphones can be used on some days this is a huge disadvantage, especially for power users who surf the web, use wifi, shoot video, play music, watch youtube videos etc etc etc.
and to see how widely dispersed this industry is, those top 25 companies are spread across 15 different countries.
nokia has far higher assigned esteem than just a phone or gadget.
this is the best game on the 'amazing' app store.
lastly forbes mentions xbox live support.
this is probably more like windows 2.0 (remember that, ouch ouch ouch) than windows 3.0 which finally was the first windows on the pc that was (barely) usable.
the flash on the lumia 800 is led, the first nokia flagships to go better was the n95 and n82 in 2007 with xenon flash.
i do know nokia pretty well, as a former nokia executive and having followed it actively through my independent consulting career this past decade, and regularly discussing nokia in my books and on this blog (i was just quoted about nokia in the financial times this week for example).
so is it factually not true (once again the elop delusions) in this empirical case about fighting in ecosystems rather than handsets, that nokia supposedly "fell behind, we missed big trends, and we lost time.
hearing about kodaks resignation and demise also got me thinking about nokia, and indeed other organisations and industries that struggle and fail as they were unable to adjust to what was them an ambiguous world.
no wonder nokia's brand is being flushed down the toilet.
this damage is not only the world record crash of market share of any mobile phone handset maker.
note, this doesn't exist and no word has been given that it will be arriving to windows phone and/or lumia.
even the 'burning platforms obsolete' symbian based nokia (ovi) app store has twice that in apps.
anssi vanjoki even if asleep, even if simultaneously having nightmares, could still outperform the 6.4 million under those conditions.
they have remained silent (in shock).
but yes, apps and the mobile web had switched places (they did not ask about the camera).
even stephen elop's past employer microsoft believes so strongly in mobile advertising, they bought screentonic, and today have mobile advertising a central aspect of the windows phone ecosystem.
of the total population on the planet, out of any person who has ever used any type of camera, for 9 out of 10 such users, the only type of camera they have ever used, is on some cameraphone.
and for the car makers, it makes no sense to split their data traffic to many mobile operators, rather to accumulate their total traffic load and negotiate with all carriers/mobile operators to get the best bulk deal for the whole fleet of cars, on one network.
we can have our washing machine connected to the web (there are some that are sold already that offer internet connectivity).
in india for example nokia was toppled in 2011 from being the topmost brand.
until they get disrupted - brutally, cruelly, their cultural hubris means they can't deal with the ambiguity.
and nokia would often time its mass market launches with particular precision - consider its 3g phones for example.
and elop could plan carefully, organize everything and make sure the most important product launch in nokia's history would be a total success.
nokia could throw all at it, and microsoft would essentially then double that still.
if you seriously believe that microsoft can win enterprise/corporate customers of any meaningful degree with nokia, you are deluding yourself.
the employees did this with aliases, but were revealed from the website addresses they used.
all the new ceo needs to do, is to communicate nokia's true performance more clearly than previous nokia managers have done in the past.
i'll be the first to admit most consumers won't use most features and in recent years the smartphones have become so complex, even expert users couldn't work all parts of their phones.
yes, we have the clever plants-to-humans communications by agrihouse of japan who offer the humidity sensors to plants that send sms messages to the owner saying when the plants need to be watered.
so we can say that in 13 years, mobile has already cannibalized over a third of the computer market.
the modern way to do utilities metering is with a digital meter, connected wirelessly to the network.
so if we count nokia branded qt ecosystem potential reach, it is well in excess of 1 billion pockets.
nokia is able to stretch its range to suit very divergent needs.
but not to tag all trees, only those scheduled for the next round of cuts in the forest.
if you don't trust them europeans and want the pew picture, we have that too.
so the second highest factor deciding which smartphone normal consumers buy, is brand.
i have used real consumer data mostly from 2011, to examine every major element that is decisive in smartphone purchases today.
it did not set the world on fire, the gaming side.
this is all someting stephen elop was not in any way involved with, yet he stands to reep the rewards of the work that was done before him.
the forbes article starts off saying windows phone has a totally unique user interface.
the users absolutely love it, suggesting the phone seems to read your mind..  and taking those lessons, nokia launched nokia money in india and is enabling near field to all its new smartphones.
no, lumia will not do better than nokia did before with e-series on symbian and e-series on symbian is more microsoft-friendly and enterprise/corporate user friendly than lumia using windows phone.
in practise, its banking and credit cards when considering the classic major financial industries, or digital money in a technical sense (insurance is also going to join the mobile revolution a bit later).
adjusted for growth, this time that would be 6.4 million units.
the most used aspect on our phones is not apps or web surfing.
the top 3 are not just from different countries, but based on different continents.
the reason nokia is now conducting a fire sale of its best assets is only due to incompetent management by its ceo, causing self-induced damage to nokia, its products, its carrier relations, its customers and its brand.
the sensible smartphone designed for emerging world markets as a low-cost smartphone will have dual sim slots, will have family ringing and family phonebooks (allowing the sharing of one phone with several family members) and will include the torch/flashlight etc where the village has no street lights at night etc.
if stephen elop can deliver 6.4 million lumia sales in the past q4, i am willing to say in public, i was wrong, he is competent to manage nokia and i will accept he's made some mistakes that should be forgiven as learning on the job.
the digital convergence may be making the difference between the average musician and superstar even greater - a madonna or rolling stones can command astronomical fees, but the average starting rock band probably earns about the same per 'gig' per night, adjusted for inflation, as rock bands did in the time of the beatles and elvis 50 years ago.
and the nsn unit is a drain on profitability, even if they manage miniscule profits in the unit.
the smartphones were competing with many other nokia smartphones already in the stores, so they faced competition from nokia's own product line.
that is all water under the bridge.
the n97 was a rare nokia stumble, but that pain is just about over.
informa counted that the world had 67 million people with a mobile banking account.
no, nokia doesn't need patent protection, and this wont' matter one iota in lumia's success or failure.
now it seems to be clear, it will be that the internet will converge onto the mobile.
then nokia had to be far better than ranked 8th outside of the usa, after all the usa is by far the biggest economy on the planet.
but lets just examine that potential advertising target audience a bit more.
not only has microsoft been sleeping with everybody, but microsoft then awards its 'strategic partners' with a sexually transmitted incurable disease as a parting gift.
and that kind of provocative argument does suggest those considering the market opportunity to also focus on who and what is to be connected, to understand we will run out of humans to connect, very soon, and the growth will need to be made from other devices and gadgets and pets and so forth.
even if every one of them was now suddenly made 3g compatible with a mobile data subscription, in ten years of sales we'd only hit 4 billion more connected devices.
there are lots of opportunities, but also lots of endless pits of wasted effort in mobile, where the profits will never come.
except that i have bad news for you.
it did not surprise any real experts of the mobile industry, many of us said days after elop announced hismad microsoft strategy last february, that this would be the result, like i did on this blog, correctly forecasting that nokia's market share would crash to 12% by the end of the year, and nokia's strongly growing profits in its smartphone unit would reverse into loss-making, and the damage to all of nokia would be so severe, that all of nokia would generate a loss by the end of the year.
100% efficiency required 24 / 7 / 365.25.
the lumia 800 doesn't support hdmi out which came to nokia on the e7, and now some top rivals do it too.
i have been preaching the convergence story in each of my 9 books and was personally involved in the early stages of the digital convergence, from creating the world's first computer company advertisement to the internet (media and internet convergence) to leading the team that created the world's first fixed-mobile converged solution (fixed and mobile telecoms convergence) to authoring early documents on the future of convergence (at nokia's telephony gateways digital convergence unit, i authored the first white paper for the industry to discuss how to do the internet on mobile).
the sad thing is, that usually with new lines, nokia has done a pair, ie the n8 was the tablet style pure touch screen, and its sister model was the e7 with the qwerty slider.
the lumia 800 doesn't support video calling (gosh, how far back can i go, i think it was the 6680 back about 2004 that first had videocalling support and every nokia flagship has had it since.. except not now the lumia.
i am always talking of real prices, not the bogus prices of bundled contracts with handset subsidies.
in europe pew found in every country the same order, sms most, camera second and web third.
we've heard the internet people like google and yahoo say that the next internet is mobile; and in the countries where the internet is already fully mobile (south korea, japan etc) they say the next internet is in the car.
nokia once made wifi equipment, broadband equipment, etc etc.
its easy for many in banking and credit cards to be fooled into thinking this tsunami wave of convergence will not hit their shores.
its the ultimate job for someone hungry to make a name as a miracle-maker in high tech.
so i can talk about nokia's strategy and corporate health, in this age of the 'ultimate contest in convergence' for the 5 trillion dollar prize, as i blogged last week.
it may become so in the future, but its not yet nearly competitive with advanced os platforms out there.
the african farmer who earns 2 dollars per day, can neither afford to buy the iphone at 600 dollars without contract, nor to sign up for a 2 year contract of 50 dollars per month to get a 'free' iphone on handset subsidy).
first, remember that only 1 in 5 smartphones sold worldwide is a business/enterprise smartphone.
(for us readers, remember, a 'free' iphone 3gs on 2 year contract is not a free phone.
then the comparison - sms text messaging alone is worth 100 billion dollars.
so if we look at lego the dangers of trying to innovate whilst looking in the rear view mirror om malik writes, as my friend pip coburn says, turnarounds never turn.
we are looking at the biggest economic prize of our lifetimes, and it is 'in play' as we speak, with fortune 500 giants like nokia, apple, google, hewlett-packard, vodafone, microsoft, sony, samsung etc all angling to be one of the winners in this ultimate race of the decade, perhaps even the race of the century.
the engine your tata sportscar has, came from proton the cheap car maker in malaysia.
so maybe we can find salvage from the microsoft side of this partnership.
the tech reviews after using windows phone (and lumia) are quite consistent that windows phone is not yet ready for prime time.
thats a bit what the job of ceo of nokia is today.
and rather than it costing say 200,000 dollars, i charge you 150,000 dollars for the brand new ferrari.
we heard from apple - the leader in app stores - earlier this year, that the total earned by the apple iphone app store last year was under a billion dollars.
last spring and summer i often got caught up with the minutiae of the percentage in market share or the next user number in text messages or the latest added consumers to mobile, etc.
we may get some millions of connections, but this math won't even start to work until we look at billions, or at least major fractions of billions.
nokia monitored the space, and as mobile advertising slowly achieved acceptance beyond some of the most advanced markets like japan and south korea (and scandinavia) nokia then got serious about mobile advertising when it bought enpocket.
this issue is a total non-issue - for end-user consumers when buying the smartphone.
nokia which could easily do this, rather has made three variations of one boring theme.
the north american market situation is the trickiest communication problem.
secondly, remember that blackberry owns roughly speaking half of that.
the worse assumption is that all 8 billion sold gadgets are still used by the end of 2020.
they had the wisdom to recognise the old model of commerce was broken they had the courage to explore new and emergent means by which to create a new sustainable business they listened deeply and evolved an internal ability to critically appraise where they needed to get to they recognised the important patterns in co-creation and how they could have real benefits for r&d, organisational capability, commercial models and marketing
so next lets connect our pets.
whatever you thought of microsoft success or failure in the past in mobile, the ex general manager of windows phone tells us that microsoft had indeed had a bad relationship with carriers, microsoft's attitude to carriers had already been one of arrogance and abuse; and that carriers hated it;and that since then microsoft had been making matters worse - and the resulting penalty from carriers was to push sales away form microsoft to android.
nokia's past flagship phones have proudly done ar, but not these lumias.
nokia has the widest range of components and suppliers.
in 2010 nokia's annual unit sales was 100 million smartphones which gave nokia a market share in smartphones of: 33%.
apple's iphone or indeed none of apple's products compete directly with 2/3 of nokia's business (the dumbphones and the networks).
what usually totally surprises us based readers is how strong nokia is outside of the usa.
the enterprise/business market is very stable over time, it will not be significantly over 100 million today, so enterprise smartphones account for roughy speaking 1 out of every 5 smartphones sold globally.
this sale of nokia's pioneering mobile ad unit is how the ceo rewards those parts of nokia that did indeed"deliver innovation fast enough".
but it will help create some image of stephen elop as a miracle maker if analysts a few years later start believing a legend that elop came to save nokia and in doing that, he defeated apple's unstoppable gains in smartphones.
there is a second technical manufacturing problem already admitted by nokia .
so its no surprise to my readers and fans, and readers at this blog, that i believe passionately in digital convergence.
canalys statistics tell us that in china in 2010 in q2 the market share for nokia (obviously running symbian) was.. get this.. 77% !!!
but if you do love the pure slab tablet style pure touch screen smartphone.
if we split that by weeks, its 1,000 trees cut per week.
these were major surveys of all mobile phone owners.
except that i have bad news for you.
so the 50 billion number has to include lots of devices per person, as well as a lot of non-human connections, whether devices, household gadgets, cars, etc; as well as other living beings like pets, farmyard animals and even connecting other things like plants.
the xbox brand is strong.
windows phone had its peak sales a year ago of about 1.5 million smartphones in the quarter.
similarly for example notebook and netbook pcs are not counted for lenovo or samsung etc.
it is perfectly possible that nokia and microsoft marketing have convinced a random customer that they do want the nokia lumia smartphone.
i am not in any way suggesting that all was perfect at nokia when elop took over.
vodafone had earlier launched some cheap featurephones for emerging world markets like india.
if microsoft windows was such a magical synergy tool, why is the consumer-oriented iphone outselling the windows smartphones in the us enterprise/corporate space, after a decade of windows mobile / windows phone sales by microsoft and its partners.
and nokia is also a smartphone maker - the biggest in the industry, with the best-selling smartphone os as well.
so this is by every measure the single biggest product launch in the history of mobile phones.
while nokia and microsoft have been repeating the 20% numbers from those big analyst houses, as recently as october of 2011, the reality is, that those numbers are not news in october.
for those pundits who obsess about the touch screen ui leadership - which apple clearly holds over any rivals in handsets - there are dozens of other issues of phone feature (and price) factors where nokia has mastered most, and is getting ever better at the touch screen too.
we know from global consumer surveys what people do on their phones, and what consumers look for when buying smartphones.
android has been killing microsoft and palm, and damaging apple - while symbian (and blackberry) has been barely touched.
and the lumia 800 doesn't offer a replacable battery.
if you thought the nokia of the past was 'obsolete' for your market, whether that was the usa or europe or asia-pacific or wherever, this lumia line offers you nothing that is better but on ten separate factors, lumia is now worse than what nokia was last year.
if elop is only an average manager, he will achieve 6.4 million in his sleep.
so very many of the stories we discuss here, will invariably touch upon nokia, or feature nokia.
nokia has easily the production capacity and the world's largest phone sales network and distribution system including the ability to air ship a million phones a day, every day, anywhere it needs to.
i do know nokia pretty well, as a former nokia executive and having followed it actively through my independent consulting career this past decade, and regularly discussing nokia in my books and on this blog (i was just quoted about nokia in the financial times this week for example).
this would not have happened if the phone and its software was designed by adults.
but first, remember that 'services' (like zune) came in at 7th most relevant point when deciding, in the industrialized world and 5th in the emerging world.
so for example the tns global survey of 34,000 mobile phone owners worldwide on their purchase priorities with mobile phones, the rankings are different.
no, the mp3 players will not be networked on the cellular network (mostly.
that is why even when nokia had problems like the failed flagship smartphone n97, nokia overall global sales did not suffer severely.
the currency fluctuations will impact quite heavily.
the bluetooth on the lumia 800 won't support many types of file transfers, it did on past nokias and does today on rival phones.
he will be seen to have saved symbian and nokia in the process..
whatever we think of the smartphone buyer in the world, the target customer for potentially 4 out of 5 buyers of smartphones, the consumers, their number 1 interest is sms text messaging.
so next lets connect our pets.
and then if you need to move your banking services to a newer phone, you can do so simply by inserting the sim card to your new phone.
microsoft and nokia did full e-series and microsoft office suite and other microsoft software business/enterprise integration in... 2009.
yes, they don't have tv sets.
of the big media industries like print, broadcast and the related advertising industries, their migration into mobile has only started and is in the low single digits in percent of total revenues or total content delivered.
reason 13 - hostile carrier relations with microsoft nokia was known to be friendly to carriers if bureaucratic and uncompromising.
but nokia did not abandon the new world like sony abandoned the musicplayer market to apple's ipod.
but the application developers' interest in making apps is totally dependent on their belief that its worth their while.
but even worse, is that microsoft never used to have good carrier relationships.
and the n8 was that cameraphone used to shoot a full-length motion picture that had a commercial release.
the second biggest smartphone maker brand in china was motorola and nokia was ..
and you think, ok, but it does drive well, and at least it was designed by the iconic sportscar superstar designers from italy.
most of the work mr elop will be doing is stuff we'd never even bother to write about on this blog.
the issues range from network coverage to service reliability to network technology to service offering and pricing etc.
now this week we heard that there won't be any android smartphones on the vodafone brand.
secondly, i promised a review of major smartphone player strategies after the half-year results came in.
the microsoft loyalty and brand was equally demolished with the catastrophic crash of its market from 10% in the us market in 2009 to 5% in 2010 to under about 1% today (when adding both windows mobile and windows phone).
whereas in the emerging world, for smartphone purchases, consumers will look at the operator/carrier as the third most important issue - where nokia's reputation has suffered with elop and lumia; and its partnering with microsoft has only made matters worse.
so in february of 2010 i went through the trouble of calculating out the pure mobile revenues of all the biggest players in mobile andpublished the world's first global listing of the 25 largest companies, when ranked only by their mobile revenues.
before search engines, it was not practical to try to find 'all available information' on a given topic, unless you lived next door to a major library like the us library of congress and were a wiz at using the library's card catalog system - and then spend hours digging through book indexes and tables of content.
this issue is a total non-issue - for end-user consumers when buying the smartphone.
more likely, today consumers have so many ways to get music by sideloading and on free music services, that it won't matter one iota.
nokia is one of the giants of that business too, which is not well known, as it is a b2b (business to business) type of enterprise.
blackberry is collapsing in consumer sales in the usa, yes, that is true (but growing internationally) but the enterprises are replacing their smartphones rather loyally, berry by berry.
we just heard from morgan stanley that they project nokia and microsoft to sell 37 million lumia phones this year 2012 and 64 million lumia smartphones next year 2013.
at&t will sell the lumia 900 as an exclusive.
south korea was the first country to make 'cards' out of credit cards optional - all credit card services are automatically enabled onto your mobile phone (instantly when the credit is approved), and if you want, a free plastic traditional credit card can be mailed in a few days also to your home address - if you so desire.
these are all industries whose size is above 200 billion dollars annually - ie each is bigger than the total global handset business including smartphones and dumbphones and all phone based accessories like spare batteries and phone covers and memory cards etc (combined, is worth about 160 billion dollars in total - a small fraction of the 1.1 trillion dollar mobile telecoms industry where the majority of the revenues come from mobile services like voice, sms and premium mobile data services).
their very first strategic partner and launch customer for microsoft's first smartphones, uk based sendo was driven to bankruptcy after lengthy court cases with the evil empire.
in reality, the top of the market is not the growth opportunity in smarpthones - all major analysts say, time and again, that the growth opportunity in smartphones is in the bottom of the price range, as smartphones go mainstream to the mass market consumers.
all consumer reviews by the tech press say that the lumia 800 fails head-to-head against the iphone 4s or samsung galaxy etc, and the lumia 900 doesn't bring anything better on its look and feel.
the planet did not suddenly have a huge rise in its wealth in the past two years (arguably, we've suffered globally with the economic crash).
and while some companies are often in the news, like say microsoft, a big giant in the it industry, by its mobile revenues, microsoft isn't even close to entering the chart.
some of that was due to the global economic downturn (remember, 3 of its rivals in the big 5 handset makers reported losses in their handset business during this economic crisis - nokia never did.
- deficient operating system the windows phone 7 and 7.5 operating systems do look cool and sexy when shown on stage or briefly demo'ed.
they were used on par with mobile internet and far above apps.
motorola was so bad at it, that for about two years, for every one customer they convinced to 'upgrade' to a smartphone, they lost literally nine other previous motorola customers of dumbphones to either other branded dumbphones, or the new pure smartphone makers like apple, rim and htc.
the camera is the second most used feature.
similarly hp, which bought palm (but has since discontinued that business) didn't make it to the top 25.
but sufficient to say that clearly more than half of consumer uses of telling time - and of the wake-up alarm - is now from the mobile phone.
nokia has the carrier relationships to turn a good phone into a big hit and the n8 seems to be very well poised to do well.
t-mobile will sell the lumia 710 but not the 800 or 900.
even though nokia designed three very similar spec smartphones (and nokia has tons of qwerty phones on symbian, s40 and meego operating systems).
secondly, i promised a review of major smartphone player strategies after the half-year results came in.
they do have mobile phones but ones that cost under 50 dollars, often as cheap as 20 dollars new.
which file standards does the media player support.
in rough terms the installed base of s40 currently is more than 700 million, so when added together, symbian and s40 give nokia an addressable market potential of 1 billion mobile phone users worldwide.
then forbes says that zune is a reason why windows phone will succeed.
if you buy the 2011 edition now, you will receive both almanacs for the price of one.
microsoft used its scale to crush apple, even where mac was always better.
microsoft has been able to peddle thesheer impossibility of a 'third ecosystem' - which even microsoft loyalists would not have believed considering how ridiculous are ballmer-oriented claims about microsoft's future - but they suddenly believed it, when the nokia ceo said the same.
the microsoft loyalty and brand was equally demolished with the catastrophic crash of its market from 10% in the us market in 2009 to 5% in 2010 to under about 1% today (when adding both windows mobile and windows phone).
i was just in toronto at the mobile think tank this week and learned from professor matrix of queens university, that 70% of canadian college students use a blackberry.
elop doubled down and made the most costly management communciation fiasco in the economic history of mankind and devastated nokia's brand and market demand.
google believes so strongly in mobile advertising, they bought admob.
but in music, mobile can cannibalize all digital music.
yes, so the biggest usable number we can start with, is the human population.
at only 9.99 euros, the unrestricted pdf based ebook is formated for the smartphone screen so you can have the stats in your pocket every day.
there is very much more in the article including aspects that are particular to the emerging world (where half of all smartphones are now sold) and issues to such matters as build quality - microsoft and nokia have already admitted to two production quality problems with lumia.
welcome stephen and we wish you the very best of luck from here at the communities dominate blog - both alan moore and i have been regular advisors to nokia in the past, and we know you will be joining a great team of professional senior managers who take things strategically and with focus, yet constantly observing this industry - mobile - to ensure nokia understands how the landscape is evolving.
now last year in february that all was suddenly sunk, with the elop effect.
from february 2011 to today, nokia has set a world record in destroying its market share.
google just told us last year that google makes 2.5 billion dollars of advertising revenues out of its mobile advertising arm.
nokia had the best carrier relationships in the world.
nokia ceo stephen elop is once again acting in the best interests of microsoft, and against the best interests of nokia.
the n97 was a rare nokia stumble, but that pain is just about over.
nokia voluntarily abandons nearly half of the addressable market and instead - forces, forces all lumias to be compared to iphones (rather than compared to blackberries).
the nokia symbian platform, one of several nokia technical platforms, and the one most suited for mobile advertising today, is not just the world's biggest smartphone operating system by installed base - andadvertisers will equate installed base with 'audience' rather than new sales, where last year elop's mis-management of nokia smarpthones saw symbian sales fall behind google's android and apple's iphone ios.
i don't know if other smartphones support this function yet but obviously nokia has brought it to newer phones like the e7.
i can't 'prove' prove it to you, but it is very widely accepted by experts in the industry, that nokia's resale channel froze in february and nokia products were removed from displays etc.
compare to nokia's biggest rival (who is not apple's iphone, it is obviously samsung).
the reviews of wp7 apps say rather consistently that they are poor versions of their iphone and android masters, and further, that they do not take advantage of wp7's abilities.
it is true that the dumbphone market is shifting to smartphones - they expect half of all new smartphones sold in the usa next year to be smartphones - that is happening in western europe now, and has already happened in some of the most advanced markets of the world - like my new home country of hong kong where half of all phones already are smartphones today.
i don't have a good measure for wristwatches and alarm clocks.
i mentioned the sms crippling text.
nokia had very accurately foreseen the future markets as they emerged, and provided suitable, low-cost smartphones for those markets and utterly dominated the emerging world.
in q2 of 2009 windows smartphones in the usa had 9.7% market share according to gartner.
even the inventor of sms, matti makkonen finished his career at nokia (he was my last mentor).
the bluetooth on the lumia 800 won't support many types of file transfers, it did on past nokias and does today on rival phones.
this 'flagship' phone seems like it was designed by total amateurs who were somehow utterly ignorant of the vast competence nokia had built over the past decade.
rather than achieve corporate sales successes for their 'strategic partnership' elop rather prepared his job transfer from microsoft to become ceo of nokia the next year.
he claimed last year in his notorious burning platforms memo that nokia had fallen behind on this ecosystems war.
those are not my numbers, they are morgan stanley's numbers and they are the first analyst house to dare to make a projection on the nokia-microsoft partnership.
it just took 90% of the market.
the lumia 800 doesn't have a qr code reader installed.
even in the big growth stages of the android now, symbian has lost only a little, still selling more than 4 out of every 10 new smartphones this year - where microsoft's windows mobile and palm
and in 10 times out of 12, the carrier will not offer the lumia which the customer would want.
nokia has taken its customer base and walked it in front of a firing squad, and shot it dead.
how long is it worthwhile to try to fight for that ultra-cheap market and what strategic moves if any, nokia may want to make in that space.
and elop could plan carefully, organize everything and make sure the most important product launch in nokia's history would be a total success.
it is perfectly possible that nokia and microsoft marketing have convinced a random customer that they do want the nokia lumia smartphone.
hard as in – numbers driven, with a high tempo for delivering the quarterly numbers.
but the guardian tech writer who bought a lumia 800 in the uk before christmas,was so fed up with it already after christmas when using it, he returned the smartphone - and wrote in one of britain's biggest newspapers that its what he did.
no exploding batteries at nokia.
i am not saying nokia had somehow magically caught up with the iphone butthe fact is, nokia had a record christmas quarter in 2010, and then things were improving for 2011.
and, as the forces of disruption increases often the resistance of organisations under threat does not abate but intensifies, until flailing against this unknown or misunderstood enemy they exhaust themselves.
they can happily leave the small 'pro market' to the specialists like nikon and canon.
even the superphones are featured in the stores even as few customers ever can afford them.
but it will see more returns than its peers.
in some of the more affluent markets on the above list, most households do have tv sets like in china and russia.
but as this blog is a mobile industry blog, it does make sense to put the big companies in context, especially across the operators, handset makers and infrastructure providers.
so it would have been an easy selling attribute for anyone trialling a lumia in a store.
ofcom's global survey just in november 2011 reported that sms was by far most used service in europe and the usa, mobile web well below and apps further down the list.
that is nokia excellence in cameras.
thus they cannot sustain the number of players they have today.
but also, that there were some good reasons as well, and that i could well see why the shareholders felt that was needed.
nokia offers both of course as makes sense in this market.
in africa, literally, for about half of the population, the first radio they ever personally owned, is the one that comes on the nokia phone.
so its pretty phoney by forbes to add this as a reason why windows phone will 'make a big splash' in the smartphones market this year.
i don't see xbox gaming to be a 'game changer' haha.
this phenomenon continues and reports trickle in from many countries that nokia smartphones are conspicuous in their absense from store shelves and inventories.
there are few things that were long in the pipeline, that will now come as gifts to the new ceo.
this is a brand which is not loved.
because of it, nokia now is in deep trouble and has to try to sell assets just to remain alive.
nokia failed the opportunity to do something apple doesn't.
and we know the decorations are not genuine nokia - the operating system and apps (the paint job).
but first, remember that 'services' (like zune) came in at 7th most relevant point when deciding, in the industrialized world and 5th in the emerging world.
yes, obviously the lumia will stand out in the crowd, but it will soon mean that lumia owners will be ashamed to show their phones.
this is due to the voices of fear, cynicism and prejudice.
if they had aggressively pursued the mobile market, either through a premium cameraphone or a specialist role in the ecosystem or in partnership - any of the big giants of cameras could have a major role in the mobile industry today.
this is a very hard thing to do and few do it well -lego being an example of the few .
they have zero concept of what a farmer in nigeria needs or a lumberjack in brazil or a fisherman in the philippines.
the 'talent scout' at recording companies (the big labels) is a job that is disappearing.
even better than that, nokia's operating system for smartphones, symbian, is so huge, it powers half of all smartphones in use on the planet.
what of navteq, of nokia money, or mobile avertising, the ovi store, etc etc etc.
in britain lumia didnt make it into the top 10 bestselling smarpthones even for the december month.
major mobile industry players from carriers/operators like vodafone and telefonica to equipment makers like ericsson and alcatel-lucent offer solutions in the mobile ad space.
he is available for consulting, speaking engagements and as expert witness, please write to tomi (at) tomiahonen (dot) com recent posts the truth.
secondly, remember that blackberry owns roughly speaking half of that.
some batteries draw down too fast, others don't recharge properly and sometimes the problem blocks the whole battery operation.
even blackberry has been seeing declines in market share.
the only thing genuine ferrari is the badge, which they bolted onto this fake ferrari, and even that was not put on in italy.
advertising goes where the media audiences go.
i honestly do not know, but i would not be surprised, if there weren't many middle to senior managers who really should be moved on.
then yes, the lumia 900 and lumia 800 are good-looking smartphones,but not as good as the iphone 4s while being in the same price range.
but the migration of money is very slow.
so in the usa, on this lumia partnership, the conventional wisdom says that the microsoft brand will help restore nokia (on the brand).
cnn for example was promoting its symbian smartphone app worldwide on countless daily ads on all cnn channels.
the second biggest country by population is india.
elop will have squandered the only chance nokia had had, to try to shift platforms, and blasted what any opportunity may have been left for lumia.
the ovi store was nothing, nobody and nowhere in the usa and no doubt when elop flew every week from finland to his other home in seattle usa, he felt ovi was a failure.
i called it the ahonen index and as far as i've seen, nobody else has published a similar list - quite astonishing considering that mobile is the fastest-growing giant industry, ever.
if nokia abandoned all that leadership, and surrendered to the whims of google, that would be a colossal mistake.
1.6 billion people live without electricity according to cnn in 2008, so if we take the average household size of 4 people per household globally, thats 400 million households without electricity.
so you could shoot many hours of dvd quality video and then just swap your microsd card and continue shooting.
lumia 800 doesn't have tv out, that came to nokia flagships in the n93 in 2006 and many rivals have it.
and they are very happy to quote reputable analyst houses who promised windows phone with nokia will reach 20% market share or better in smartphones.
if there are 5.1 billion mobile phone subscribers on the planet - and the option is to be the best-selling phone for that part which is 285 million of those - or the remaining part which is 4.815 billion mobile phone users - nokia has focused correctly.
the big music store chains started to fail and go out of business.
if you really love your qwerty look, you won't even consider these lumias.
and elop himself admitted he miscalculated how badly nokia smartphone sales would collapse, and he also admitted surprise to the sudden massive losses that obviously resulted.
he is a north american, he knows the way to talk to north american press and analysts and investors - that is where most of nokia shares are held.
no matter what the apple loyalists think of the iphone, it will never be a mass market phone.
i honestly am not even googling his background now - i am sitting at a starbucks in toronto, waiting for my next meeting appointment, and am drafting this article with a nice tall cup of cappuchino.
then we have issues with poverty, with illiteracy (800 million people of reading age are illiterate worldwide - illiterates will not need a laptop surely, and probably won't have much need of more than one phone in most cases), with wars, famines, and refugees.
the real top 13 reasons why nokia lumia and windows phone will fail, not just in usa but across planet nokia was prominently featured at the ces show in the usa this week, the biggest consumer electonics show of north america.
i have written another long blog explaining why skype is the ultimate red flag to carriers/operators.
even if every one of them was now suddenly made 3g compatible with a mobile data subscription, in ten years of sales we'd only hit 4 billion more connected devices.
nokia could have given us great feel on the mechanics - where nokia excels far above all other handset makers.
it is a cheap copycat of the iphone style touch screen input and lumia abandons natural nokia strengths while showing no competitive advantages.
so the touch screen input is no better than any rivals, and is worse than the best.
ofcom's global survey just in november 2011 reported that sms was by far most used service in europe and the usa, mobile web well below and apps further down the list.
i was just in toronto at the mobile think tank this week and learned from professor matrix of queens university, that 70% of canadian college students use a blackberry.
i think this suggests the times are so bad, that we will still see more casualties this year.
it meant that previous global giants of other industries had decided to enter the mobile space, like computer makers such as apple and dell, like internet giants like google and yahoo, like mobile operators/carriers like vodafone and hutchison, and softwre maker giant microsoft etc.
that was the best market share of any smartphone maker in britain.
that is what lenovo wants now, as they launched their lephone and sold 100,000 units in the first quarter.
in fact, the future of the internet is mobile.
nokia sells more s40 based featurephones, which use the proprietary s40 operating system (not part of symbian) but which could be described as 'smartphone lite' - just like symbian, s40 does allow full internet use, allows application downloads and the use of the nokia (ex ovi) store for content, apps and services.
lets add in a laptop per person.
andnow elop wants to cause all that confusion by discontinuing the ovi store brand.
i would be very confident in believing that at least the n8 will not be seen as a failure in its early reviews the way the n97 was received.
the competition is so tight that competitors are dropping like flies.
some premium ipods probably will offer the connectivity but even those, mostly will not connect to the cellular, and will rather connect via wifi).
and then you find out, the car was designed by the tractor factory designers from zetor in russia.
now last year in february that all was suddenly sunk, with the elop effect.
and for apple-watchers, not only has 'apple iphone' jumped up massively on the list, apple only making smartphones is almost as big as nokia with smartphones, dumbphones and the mobile side of nokia's networking business, combined.
people at nokia talked about a multimedia mobile computer, but it couldn’t look beyond those 12 keys.
but the timing is close enough, that any 'revival' by nokia can be seen mirroring a decline by apple - and from now forward, it will be credited to the new ceo, even though he actually had nothing to do with that.
like they say in africa, mobile is not the 7th mass medium, its not the first mass medium; it is the only mass medium.
but the lumia 710 has a decidedly cheap look to it, very plasticky.
there are few things that were long in the pipeline, that will now come as gifts to the new ceo.
i do think that the very superficial view to stephen elop's past suggest he could be a great ceo for nokia.
so for a forest of a million trees that has been managed well, so it has an even balance of trees of all ages, then about 5% of the trees reach maturity any one year.
elop took that growth and torpedoed it, and for 2011 nokia global market share collapsed from 29% in q4 of 2010 to about 12% in q4 of 2011 (we will know when nokia releases its q4 results shortly).
as this is a 'partly true' issue, the new ceo needs to tackle it on two sides - address the actual profitability rigorously, but also communicate it far more clearly - that nokia as a mass market consumer phone maker - should be compared to samsung, lg, sonyericsson and motorola (and zte) - and compared to any of those, nokia profits are very good.
by divesting nsn, nokia could focus more on its core business - related to handsets - and instantly get a jump on the profitability of the company.
i've told the story of modern forestry management, where trees are tagged with devices containing gps-gsm chips, for intelligent digital forest management.
he looks at global trends where the whole industry is in agreement - like now with mobile advertising.
what possible benefit can it deliver, while nokia's overall apps partnering is in turmoil with symbian and meego and maemo and windows phone and s40 and meltemi and whatnot.
in fact, it has severe shortcomings with no foldering, so the more you install apps, the more cluttered and clumsy it becomes.
this is what smartphone owners in the usa, britain, spain, australia, germany, france, canada, singapore etc have said.
that is a way to produce exceptional devices and services - for the luxury crowd, ie for a tight niche market - but it is not the way to win the world.
this is the best game on the 'amazing' app store.
except that in december 2013 the world will have about two billion smartphones in use (we will see about 700 million sold this year alone).
so then lets move from animals to plants.
the decision to sell the mobile advertising unit at nokia may have been necessary because nokia is so badly generating a loss.
its a nice number yes, but what is the record-breaking achievement in the tiny sandbox called iphone, is trivial to the big world of mobile.
and when kodak finally did embrace digital in 1993 it did with hesitance that comes when companies are afraid to cannibalize their existing businesses for the sake of the future.
nokia had better glass on its optics, better sensors in the camera and better software for the pictures.
that was the norm for dumbphone makers.
first, lets be very clear, in the past decade we did grow 10-fold in mobile (vs only 3-fold growth in the internet for example).
deutsche bank counted in 2009 that the total global market for enterprise/business smartphones was 96 million handsets.
in terms of a viable 'mobile phone age' population, what is the total population of 6.8 billion people today, can be seen to be the viable mobile phone aged population a decade from now.
if one of its three lumia models is aimed to be an iphone 'killer' then make the other two as different and all three quite distinct from each other.
nokia didn't need to pay one penny to apple.
microsoft feels it worthwhile to continue building its mobile advertising unit even as its reach across both windows mobile and windows phone smartphones, currently, is less than 30 million.
if elop could have left symbian alone, he would be now reaping the benefits of all the hard work nokia did over the years.
the big music store chains started to fail and go out of business.
no: ex windows phone general manager at microsoft, charlie kindel, who acknowledges that microsoft had further angered the carriers in 2011.
there also are many other industries that are seeing impact from mobile, but who are unlikely to be totally cannibalized by mobile.
81% of the total telecoms industry has migrated from fixed landlines (0% in 1978) to mobile when counting total subscribers.
like the book publishing industry is doing in japan for example where mobile books outsell ebooks already.
all nokia smartphones have allowed users to install apps for all of the past decade.
but if you think about the real power and influence, real revenues, employees, etc, the above gives a good listing of who are the 25 biggest companies in mobile.
you get full registration and all details.
this against the reported evidence that the iphone is breaking all of its sales record and on every national chart for which i have seen statistics, the iphone 4s sits as the bestselling phone for q4.
but please read the full analysis: lets start with consumers smartphones (invented by nokia four years before the blackberry) first were enterprise/business tools.
whereas in the emerging world, for smartphone purchases, consumers will look at the operator/carrier as the third most important issue - where nokia's reputation has suffered with elop and lumia; and its partnering with microsoft has only made matters worse.
the short term allure of the tiles does provide some in-store excitement.
non-linear because it is for all of us socially, organisationally and economically ambiguous, confusing and worrying.
not just pruning unnecessary tech 'bloat' but literally going back in tech, to specs that were normal on nokia phones a year, two, even three years ago.
those were burned by the ceo last year.
same for htc, the pure smartphone maker.
and then if you need to move your banking services to a newer phone, you can do so simply by inserting the sim card to your new phone.
the only way that is possible, is if smartphones have become less expensive at the low end of the price point.
we know the market share crashed, sales revenues crashed and nokia profits vanished.
nonetheless, to sell a mobile advertising unit for a major handset maker goes totally against the grain, where rivals are investing more in advertising, not less.
it did not end the need for 'real musicians' ie playing at symphony orchestras etc, but it helped popularize music creation, by the masses, for the masses.
and elop did not see it coming, and did not manage his company wisely.
and you can't ride the dead horse the only thing you can do, is get off the horse and find some other way to proceed.
nonetheless, apple's iphone has an installed based (not cumulative shipments, but active users) of about 150 million smartphone users today.
so the second most important thing customers ask for, which was a strong nokia asset, has been ruined not by manufacturing errors or market forces, by nokia's ceo with his idiotic communications last february.
i have no idea how many household pets there are, but i think its safe to say, the proportion of pets is far less than the total number of households, even as some households may have more than one pet.
mobile advertising (roughly) doubled in annual revenues in the year 2008 when the world economy crashed.
and most of nokia's stock price issues are related to either communication problems (not fundamental business and strategy) and of sectors of the market where nokia's global success is not in any way dependent - but which have recently received significant shareholder attention (us market, iphone, android).
if you want the lumia 710, you can only get it on t-mobile.
compare to motorola which after the razr launched the rokr and today motorola is no more, as the bankrupted and split-up handset maker it was bought by google.
i have more important things to do, this blog is not a financial analysis blog.
and elop did not see it coming, and did not manage his company wisely.
nokia was a juggernaut profit factory, selling the world's most widely adopted gadget (the mobile phone) utterly dominating that space and doing it profitably.
non-linear because it is for all of us socially, organisationally and economically ambiguous, confusing and worrying.
he is a canadian - a nationality that seems to gell particularly well with finns (maybe its all that ice hockey - the greatest ever ice hockey player, the one they called 'the greatest' ie wayne gretzky, a canadian, did after all get most of his points scored, by setting up passes to a finn - jari kurri his long-time scorer-sniper, who in turn is of course the greatest-ever finn to play ice hockey.
the rivals did not come in 2011 with superphones with unbelievable features like say time travel or teleportation.
they pay very close attention to every player in the market.
windows phone had its peak sales a year ago of about 1.5 million smartphones in the quarter.
i am however, very well aware that the banking and money industry moves very slowly, is very conservative.
that is a way to produce exceptional devices and services - for the luxury crowd, ie for a tight niche market - but it is not the way to win the world.
elop doubled down and made the most costly management communciation fiasco in the economic history of mankind and devastated nokia's brand and market demand.
and, as the forces of disruption increases often the resistance of organisations under threat does not abate but intensifies, until flailing against this unknown or misunderstood enemy they exhaust themselves.
then yes, most definitely, microsoft and nokia are in the game and can certainly be believed, that they can win this game.
(note this does not include the ultra-cheap dumbphones that use the even simpler nokia s30 os, by which nokia's total reach was last year estimated at about 1.7 billion)
he could decide how to price them and support the launch with marketing.
a nokia cameraphone so good a professional movie maker made not an 'experimental film' for a film festival, or a short film, or amateur film, but a full commercial production movie for cinematic release.
with symbian at low-cost smatphones, nokia had conquerred the world.
apple can focus exclusively on its super-premium luxury smartphone, the iphone, releasing only one new model per year, putting all its effort to create genuine most-desirable masterpieces, much like a ferrari or porsche in cars.
when you look at the lumia 900, it is like the designer of the lumia 800 fell asleep.
nokia's market share of new sales in the summer of 2010 in britain was 33% according to kantar.
so it would have been an easy selling attribute for anyone trialling a lumia in a store.
so while yes, we can probably imagine 4 or 5 household gadgets today that could easily imagine being connected, and another couple likely to come - most obviously the home robot (south korea already has consumer-oriented household robot stores in major shopping malls).
but you do love the look and feel of the ferrari and its bright red ferrari color, until you drive next to another red ferrari, and obseve that your red is not the same red.
same is true of the various other cameras-oriented industries like kodak and polaroid.
this has been reported only in anecdotal evidence and mostly in countries of the industrialized world, but nokia itself admitted in the quarterly results that its carriers and distribution channel had reduced inventory suddenly and to an unanticipatedly large degree.
at that time, we thought we were making the right decisions; but, with the benefit of hindsight, we now find ourselves years behind.
nokia wrote the book on sms.
but the first five months at nokia, when elop was in charge, saw the nokiasmartphone unit sales grow strongly,nokia smartphone sales revenues grow dramatically, andnokia profits at the smartphone unit jump at a nokia record level.
no matter what any expert may have said about how obsolete symbian was or how horrible ovi store was or how bad the software was, the one thing everybody agrees about nokia, its build quality has always - always - been the best in the world.
the forecast was based on numbers, prior to the elop effect.
nokia profits have been declining - as one might expect in a global economic downturn where many 'gold standard' corporations of impeccable credit ratings went bankrupt.
china overtook the usa as the biggest individual country market for smartphones last year.
and in no straight lines - we point to and demonstrate that there are excellent models for organisations today which would enable them to [1] transition [2] then transform into something that looks more appropriate and relevant for the world we live in today.
the reviews of wp7 apps say rather consistently that they are poor versions of their iphone and android masters, and further, that they do not take advantage of wp7's abilities.
if that feeling turned to hostility, there is good chance it can be reversed.
tns surveyed 34,000 mobile phone owners around the world and found that in the industrialized world (north america, europe, advanced asia-pacific) apps and the os do matter.
we have intelligent dog collars for hunting dogs for example, and the dogs-to-humans translator (bowlingual) which translates dog sounds to sms messages for humans of what the dog is trying to say.
do you believe that abandoning 33% market share - when your unit sales grew 47% and your revenues grew and your profits grew so explosively, for the last quarter nokia set a record in profit growth of its handset unit -and replacing that with 8% market share only 3 years later, with no growth but about flat sales, dramatically fallen revenues and at best miniscule profits (probably continued losses).
apple's steve jobs believed so strongly in mobile advertising, he launched iad.
microsoft and nokia did full e-series and microsoft office suite and other microsoft software business/enterprise integration in... 2009.
he comes from the pc and software side of the tech industry, a welcome infusion of new thinking to top management at nokia.
nokia's past flagship phones have proudly done ar, but not these lumias.
this trend was captured by the iphone but not invented by apple.
a cheap mp3 player won't gain from a 3g data connection - it would be a very sad rival to a musicphone but would add the monthly connection fee, while not offering telecoms connectivity (not being a phone).
so we will see the mettle of stephen elop, is he competent to run nokia.
lg's strategic partership with microsoft bled the company profits into losses and lg ran to android.
he could choose which type of models nokia would create - as these are truly new-from-the-ground-up smartphones, as they do not even use standard nokia components.
the 2010 flagship nokia smartphone, the n8, had a 12 mp camera and xenon flash.
while that may not technically be true, it will be a far better story for the nokia pr people to spin, than the past year of explaining why the n8 was again delayed...
massive profits in this fast-moving and dynamic industry.
i think this suggests the times are so bad, that we will still see more casualties this year.
the digital convergence enables fantastic new services and abilites we never could have imagined.
the second biggest smartphone maker brand in china was motorola and nokia was .. 16 times bigger than its nearest rival.
this bodes very well for nokia and lumia as these customers are coming in to replace their smartphones now in 2012.
what is best, is that the strategy and business basics at nokia are supremely sound.
elop in his microsoft madness decided not to use nokia's finland based competence, he went to the usa to design his lumia phones.
at the edge, because that world, our world is being overwhelmed by a trilemma of social, organisational and economic complexity.
and this is all before we start to enable my flight itself with mobile check-in, or the hotel does a mobile phone enabled locks to my hotel room etc.
again, nokia abandons what is its competitive advantage in a futile attemp to match the iphone.
but apple did what it always does, it made existing things far better - so we see a new world (in touch screen interfaces) after the iphone - and now also in tablet pcs too (kindle, ipad etc).
regardless, it is patently obvious thatmicrosoft relationships with carriers were bad before and are getting worse with windows phone.
lets say 2 utilities meters per household, and we add another 3.4 billion connections and arrive at 43.0 billion.
the decision to sell the mobile advertising unit at nokia may have been necessary because nokia is so badly generating a loss.
what travel agent could have specialized in hong kong to sao paulo travel for me today.
they say that windows phone would reach about 37 million unit sales this year and 64 million in 2013.
what possible benefit can it deliver, while nokia's overall apps partnering is in turmoil with symbian and meego and maemo and windows phone and s40 and meltemi and whatnot.
again i am not a lumberjack but to me the clever way to use this technology is for some forest 'manager' to go tagging trees that need to be felled, with the intelligent gsm-gps devices.
if you want the lumia 900, you can only get it on at&t.
then forbes says that zune is a reason why windows phone will succeed.
they have not been afraid to abandon businesses that did not show promise for the future.
this, in the country that was about to become the world's biggest smartphone market.
a survey of nearly 2,000 consumers of the uk mobile phone market by right mobile phone found that the mobile phone brand is more influential in deciding the next phone, than the carrier/operator brand.
first' is a clear indication of how seriously they are taking it.
nokia market share in smartphones has year after year, quarter after quarter, been better than its market share in dumbphones.
zune might - might - duplicate the modest success of nokia music in the best case.
note, 90% ofamerican smartphone owners wish this more than anything else, and its something for example apple refuses to do with the iphone.
microsoft has already admitted that it is true, if anyone sends a specific string sms text message (or fb message or tweet) to a microsoft phone based smartphone - it will shut down the phone and when the phone is turned back on, the messaging function is inoperable and the only fix is to wipe out everything
rather than nokia's own-designed mobile-optimised and smart os platforms, symbian and meego, this fraudster uses an os that was never designed to any degree by any nokia programmers.
in germany the same story, not even the top 10, not even for the december month.
in this nokia case, the gambler arrived with a million dollars and only has 100,000 to show for it.
and the one company that was replaced from the 2010 list - russia's biggest mobile operator by revenues, mts, was replaced by another bric company biggest operator - bharti airtel of india.
most of that was not consumer-oriented app store applications.
nokia has a vast library of videogames already formated for the small screen.
but nokia did not abandon the new world like sony abandoned the musicplayer market to apple's ipod.
nokia had better glass on its optics, better sensors in the camera and better software for the pictures.
this is a brand which is not loved.
we know the latest iteration of nokia's app store as ovi - incidentially the world's third best-selling app store for those who care about the lives of ants in the world of elephants.
one phone model costs 479 dollars, the next 529 dollars, another 499 dollars etc.
yes, even while switching to the newer os, and giving it more than a year for 'ramp up'microsoft lost again half of what customers remained.
kodak, minolta, polaroid, konica and so many other major camera industry players had to abandon the camera related business and shift to something else like professional imaging or scientific instrumentation or photocopiers or whatever, or else go bankrupt - like polaroid has done, twice already.
and the n8 was that cameraphone used to shoot a full-length motion picture that had a commercial release.
no electricity, no clever digital household gadgets either.
or perhaps the customer has a collection of movies transferred to microsd memory cards, or whatever.
publicis ceo maurice levy said that within a few years "most of the music", "most of the information" and "most of the advertising" will "transit through your cell phone.
compare to nokia's biggest rival (who is not apple's iphone, it is obviously samsung).
and when the price is about the same, on the look and feel, the lumia is the clear loser already in the store.
that was a lot of smoke-and-mirrors.
all the new ceo needs to do, is to communicate nokia's true performance more clearly than previous nokia managers have done in the past.
the multitouch interface, on capacitive touch screen, and apple's brilliant, logical and intuitive software system, all worked.
by deciding not to make what is a competitive advantage at nokia.
so ofcom is consistent with comscore that sms and the camera come ahead of web and apps.
we've had full mobile payment solutions in the philippines for a decade already.
a cheap mp3 player won't gain from a 3g data connection - it would be a very sad rival to a musicphone but would add the monthly connection fee, while not offering telecoms connectivity (not being a phone).
so yes, the automobile industry is eager to get into mobile too, many new cars feature sim card slots for example and the next internet (after the internet has gone mobile) will be in cars.
tns surveyed 34,000 mobile phone owners around the world and found that in the industrialized world (north america, europe, advanced asia-pacific) apps and the os do matter.
in 2010 nokia's annual unit sales was 100 million smartphones which gave nokia a market share in smartphones of: 33%.
this is totally different input paradigm from the touch screen, and its amazing for nokia to have been competitive in both (touch and qwerty) at the same time.
so what happened to nokia sales in britain in 12 months.
note that while apple's iphone is a one-trick pony, and only sells a touch screen super smartphone - nokia keeps selling in similar quantities of touch screen smartphones across all its product lines.
nokia used to have the platinum-standard carrier relationships a year ago.
but please lets be very clear, the problem at nokia is not anything to do with its 'smartphones strategy' and mostly not even with its smartphones execution, nor with the symbian os and the future strategy of the smartphone os into meego.
nokia had a massive competitive advantage that it simply refused to exploit.
yes, some geek like you and me may know of it, but even for us, its very very low in the order of what we want.
so its pretty phoney by forbes to add this as a reason why windows phone will 'make a big splash' in the smartphones market this year.
giving up power ain't easy, accepting and having the wisdom to see the world has changed - tough call.
they can happily leave the small 'pro market' to the specialists like nikon and canon.
nokia market share in smartphones has year after year, quarter after quarter, been better than its market share in dumbphones.
he comes from the pc and software side of the tech industry, a welcome infusion of new thinking to top management at nokia.
stand-alone digital cameras sell 103 million per year (says morgan stanley in 2009).
well, that is not really the end of the world, as long as it does have real ferrari components, except that when you look at the engine, you find it came not from ferrari's engine factory.
a new converged economic opportunity emerges within the digital convergence which will not be as big, as the separate industries would be separately.
reason 5 - fails also on windows brand microsoft is a strong brand.
and elop himself admitted he miscalculated how badly nokia smartphone sales would collapse, and he also admitted surprise to the sudden massive losses that obviously resulted.
we just heard from christmas electronics sales in the usa, that digital camera sales and videocam sales had fallen catastrophically - because consumers were switching their camera and video capture to their smartphones.
there was the famous dog who ate the nokia phone.
but please lets be very clear, the problem at nokia is not anything to do with its 'smartphones strategy' and mostly not even with its smartphones execution, nor with the symbian os and the future strategy of the smartphone os into meego.
he actually hired an outside company, compal of taiwan, to manufacture the lumia smartphones!
while the replacement cycle for non-phone portable gadgets is longer than the replacement cycle for phones, certainly a significant fraction of the total cumulative sales of that number were replacement units, of better capability, sold to the same consumer.
nokia was the first company to boldly claim that the future of phones was smartphones (a view still found controversial to many today) and more brazenly, nokia was the first company to say a smartphone was a computer (something ridiculed by the 'real' pc makers at the time, and only very recently the pc makers - all 6 of the 6 biggest pc makers in fact - have all found it to be true, that a modern smartphone is indeed a 'real' computer, only a tiny and pocket-sized one).
a comprehensive statistical review of the total mobile industry, in 171 pages, has 70 tables and charts, and fits on your smartphone to carry in your pocket every day.
just in wireless, microsoft is the mobile death wish.
81% of the total telecoms industry has migrated from fixed landlines (0% in 1978) to mobile when counting total subscribers.
this phenomenon continues and reports trickle in from many countries that nokia smartphones are conspicuous in their absense from store shelves and inventories.
i do like the bold predictions to suggest big growth, to counter those who peddle the tired myth that we are somehow at saturation or near saturation in mobile.
what usually totally surprises us based readers is how strong nokia is outside of the usa.
that will give us a nice boost to our count.
this is a hara-kiri by the ceo.
if the ecosystem is tiny, no matter how uniform it might be, if the market size is too small, they won't care.
it just took 90% of the market.
this is similar to what apple did to the pc industry in 1984 when it released the macintosh, and all 'ibm compatible' pc makers had to adapt, where the primary change was the shift to windows, microsoft's version of attempting to copy what the macintosh offered.
yes, so the biggest usable number we can start with, is the human population.
and that was of course also damaged massively by the elop effect as in the above.
this would be a painful change, but nokia has done that many many times before - it once made paper.
nokia once made wifi equipment, broadband equipment, etc etc.
symbian supports such vital business needs as.. folder (windows phone does not) and full multitasking and the transfers of apps and files via bluetooth.
and the microsoft windows phone cavalry will not arrive in time to save nokia.
the lumia 800 doesn't read usb thumb drives and memory sticks.
the cd market shrunk sales year after year.
the one sim cards is compatible with all south korean banks and credit cards etc, so its just a question of a given bank or provider enabling their account onto your banking sim card.
so don't delude yourself into thinking that lumia can somehow grow on the enterprise/corporate client side, either in the usa or the rest of the world.
so the cannibalization will eat into the size of the 'total pie' of the industries prior to convergence.
over 70% of smartphones in india over 80% over the whole continent of africa in new smartphone sales in 2010 were nokia branded.
after that all games need to be repurposed to the windows phone format - thats no small feat - and the handsets need the gaming accelerators etc for the hardware, etc.
all nokia smartphones have allowed users to install apps for all of the past decade.
whatever success or lack therof, you have seen of nokia in the business/enterprise space, that will do worse on lumia and windows phone, not better.
i don't see xbox gaming to be a 'game changer' haha.
these guys manufacture the wireless telecoms infrastructure, ie the thousands of 'base stations' and various antenna gear etc that is needed to build a billion-dollar cellular network.
microsoft could have called the new os anything.
lets add in a laptop per person.
yet in south africa it is normal to get your paycheck paid directly to your mobile account.
there even have been exotic qwerty form factors like the butterfly keyboard.
compared to nokia's previous flagships and current rivals.
its r&d processes are slow, painfully slow compared to 'internet speed' rivals like say google.
the global ad industry top management may be late to the mobile party, but they are dead serious about it now.
and you think, ok, but it does drive well, and at least it was designed by the iconic sportscar superstar designers from italy.
these number have been reported in hundreds of stories and the vast majority of those stories cheerfully reported that this was good news.
the short term allure of the tiles does provide some in-store excitement.
pocket music players including the ipod sell about 127 million units (same source for all).
so the telecoms industry itself is migrating to mobile, no surprise anymore this late in the game.
what nokia would have desperately needed out of early lumia was low-cost smartphones now, to try to hold onto that market share.
and that was of course also damaged massively by the elop effect as in the above.
if you have 20 plants in your home, and really want this level of technology to monitor each plant, yes, we could quickly pass 50 billion subscriptions.
the microsoft windows phone is not a strong brand in smartphones and neither is nokia.
but these gadgets are relatively expensive, and there is no point in paying for their cellular connectivity for the 20 to 30 year life that the tree spends growing to full size before it is felled.
and recently the nokia shareholders have lost faith in nokia, comparing nokia's flagship model only, rather unfairly, to the apple iphone, and then concluding that nokia has somehow 'lost it'.
so that was consumers.
but if you do love the pure slab tablet style pure touch screen smartphone.
suddenly in relation to the new technologies, the old habits and regulations become obstacles, the old services and infrastructures are found wanting, the old organisations and institutions inadequate.
and most of nokia's stock price issues are related to either communication problems (not fundamental business and strategy) and of sectors of the market where nokia's global success is not in any way dependent - but which have recently received significant shareholder attention (us market, iphone, android).
the digital convergence enables fantastic new services and abilites we never could have imagined.
if you seriously think that there is a trend to apps in the phone business, then yes, nokia saw it long before the current hysteria, and had built its app offering and business systematically.
it would still not be as thorough as any google search today, and it would take years to learn the skills and days of research in the library.
but one of the preferred solutions is what for example was deployed in south korea, where on the phone you have one sim card for your telecoms needs, and a banking-specific sim card for all your money needs including banking, payments, credit cards, loyalty cards etc.
microsoft will also be selling the ads irrespective of nokia's own brand.
they still spend about 30 billion dollars on it annually, only the traditional music publishing industry is getting an ever smaller slice of that.
he finds a genuine nokia asset where nokia was years ahead of the rivals - like now with mobile advertising - and rather than fix that unit's execution to deliver massive profits for nokia, he prefers to sell it.
the nokia share price was not falling in february - the stock market liked elop's first five months of nokia leadership so much, that the share price had climbed 11% - a very strong growth in a five month period for the new ceo, when the previous three years had seen a 50% drop in nokia share price.
he is not just a microsoft guy, he was previously with several other it companies based in the usa.
its flagship phone is not seen as good enough to go against the iphone.
it is well along, and the latest iteration of the symbian os is said to be far better at the touch screen parts.
in countries where the average person has no hope of ever owning a car, the mobile phone is the nearest thing to a true status symbol.
microsoft has good brands such as xbox and office suite but its windows brand is weak and in mobile, it is poisonous.
cloudtalk surveyed us smartphone owners in july and found 71% used sms and only 40% used the mobile web (they didn't ask about apps).
similarly pocketable stand-alone gaming devices sell 48 million units.
but the really weird part is, that nokia is pretty well poised to outperform its other big 5 handset maker rivals into the foreseeable future.
last quarter we have data for, q3, windows phone sales had fallen to about 500,000 units worldwide.
morgan stanley found 2% of the phones sold to be premium smartphones; 11% to be other smartphones and the remaining 87% to be 'featurephones' ie non-smartphones or 'dumbphones'.
yes, obviously the lumia will stand out in the crowd, but it will soon mean that lumia owners will be ashamed to show their phones.
apple's sudden decline comes also at optimal timing for the new ceo of nokia.
nokia partnered with german camera optics specialists carl zeiss, and from the early n-series on, nokia had far and away the best cameraphones in that part of the planet where 98% of its population lives (japan and south korea have exceptionally advanced domestic mobile phone markets).
so, in a perfect world, nokia could sell 3 handsets on four networks ie 12 variations for the consumer.
so for a forest of a million trees that has been managed well, so it has an even balance of trees of all ages, then about 5% of the trees reach maturity any one year.
and here again, nokia has the biggest production capacity.
at the edge, because that world, our world is being overwhelmed by a trilemma of social, organisational and economic complexity.
but while tech analysts marvel at the iphone (and androids now), the touch screen is not the only 'preferred' form factor, nor the 'decisive' purchase criterion.
the handset industry is different from the pc industry or home electronics, in that the carriers/operators decide which phone succeeds and which fails (witness the short-lived microsoft kin).
microsoft got into mobile advertising years ago with the purchase of screentonic.
rather than achieve corporate sales successes for their 'strategic partnership' elop rather prepared his job transfer from microsoft to become ceo of nokia the next year.
and this shift is far more price-sensitive than the enterprise/corporate phones market, so super-premium prices 'superphones' like the iphone 4 or samsung galaxy or blackberry torch will be mostly out of reach to the true mass market consumer segment.
it did not surprise any real experts of the mobile industry, many of us said days after elop announced hismad microsoft strategy last february, that this would be the result, like i did on this blog, correctly forecasting that nokia's market share would crash to 12% by the end of the year, and nokia's strongly growing profits in its smartphone unit would reverse into loss-making, and the damage to all of nokia would be so severe, that all of nokia would generate a loss by the end of the year.
current market leader samsung note has 5.3 inch screen.
nokia had secured 'carrier billing' relationships with over 100 carriers worldwide for ovi (no other rival app store had even one quarter that level - carrier billing means one-click payments that get charged directly off your phone bill or prepaid account.
and when you think about it, if google's android has about 45% and apple's iphone between 15% and 20%, then if nokia and microsoft can get 20% - game on.
samsung does just on its galaxy series the obvious iphone clone basic slab touch screen versions of almost exactly iphone physical size; and then offers the galaxy indulge with the qwerty slider; the galaxy beam with the pico projector; and the galaxy note with its gigantic screen.
taking a book from donald rumsfeld they are trying to convince investors that lumias will be greeted as liberators.
yet apple felt mobile advertising was that important to the apple iphone and ios ecosystem.
in a very rough term, we can expect that the mobile phone subscription penetration rate globally will pass about 120% human population per capita during this decade (at least).
the pure smarpthone maker htc sits just out of the chart and is likely to enter it next year.
web browser is far lower, at 33% for europeans and 39% for americans.
so the customers know nokia models and their specs.
but in all honesty, this won't happen to all people on the planet (kids for example) and definitely won't happen in one decade.
this selling of the mobile advertising unit is how nokia's new ceo indicates"accountability and leadership".
that was the best market share of any smartphone maker in britain.
enter stephen elop, from microsoft, to take the reigns as nokia's new ceo.
i am not suggesting the carriers/operators loved nokia - nokia was too big and powerful to be loved.
so, earlier this week, we had the very first major industry analyst house issue a fresh, post elop effect, forecast for nokia and microsoft windows phone.
and its not just that, very big global partners have been cross-promoting the ovi store.
yes, there are cows that are called to milk via an old mobile phone or beeper hanging on their neck, and when the cow hears the arrival of sms (or the ringing of a phone call - no danger, the cow won't answer so there won't be billable calling traffic to the farmer) the cow knows to come home to be milked.
that means that the world would match roughly what is normal in europe today.
it too made windows mobile smartphones and it also did not see a fall, on the contrary, htc saw a growth in the usa on its market share.
the n8 was so good, that the first side-by-side test with htc's titan ii - with a 16mp camera, and the n8 produced better pictures.
and obviously, after even apple added videocalling support to the iphone 4, essentially every rival (not using wp7) does videocalls.
proud owners walk with four year old models if they were top models way back when and so forth.
china overtook the usa as the biggest individual country market for smartphones last year.
yes cnn's smartphone app was available on the ovi store.
nokia did the (non japan/non-s korea) world's first 8mp cameraphone and first 12mp cameraphone.
i don't need 1 million sim cards, i need 1,000.
the replacable battery is far more necessary.
except that in december 2013 the world will have about two billion smartphones in use (we will see about 700 million sold this year alone).
about apple - remember that this is 'mobile' not 'wireless' or 'portable' so the iphone is mobile, but other ios devices, while they are portable like ipad and ipod touch, they are not mobile devices, their services are not mobile, they do not 'ring in your pocket' haha.
n/a source: tomiahonen almanac 2012, the above table and data may be freely quoted notes: * indicates imaginary company, based only on mobile revenues, with imaginary name for the company ** indicates actual real ranking in fortune global 500 listing as it is a real company purely in mobile note also that the google company incorporates motorola mobility unit revenues, but not other motorola mobile revenues of its networking etc business.
this is how he phrased it "windows phone raised its middle finger at the carriers" and to make matters worse, even after that, currently "windows phone requires microsoft to push hard on the carriers" and the carriers do not like this at all.
this while the industry reports massive jump in q4 sales by rivals like samsung and apple.
so its no surprise to my readers and fans, and readers at this blog, that i believe passionately in digital convergence.
mobile phones sell 1.3 billion units annually - in any one year they sell more mobile phones than the total installed base of personal computers on the planet.
and add to that the android installed base (qt supports android) and potentially blackberry (the new blackberry os will be compatible with qt) - the nokia 'first ecosystem' if built around qt has a potential reach of more than 1.35 billion mobile phone users (more than 5x bigger than the total ios ecosystem or the android ecosystem; more than 12 times bigger than the total blackberry ecosystem and more than 100 times bigger than the windows phone).
yet we can go to expedia or travelocity or opodo whatever travel site you want to use, and get to see dozens of flight options - and their prices - and their routes - and the actual aircraft used.
so we will see the mettle of stephen elop, is he competent to run nokia.
but we mentioned on this blog years ago, that artificial life's side-line product (their main business is tv-mobile interactive services like sms tv games etc) - a mobile java game called 'v-girl' the virtual girlfriend on your phone - sold 4 million copies.
but consumers have not abandoned music.
that is not the same in television or personal computers or cars or airplanes etc - most other industries the role of the us market is very big.
you are landing in the coolest job on the planet and may your reign be long and prosperous.
the value of just that advertising runs in the millions except that nokia got it for free.
but compared to any other handset maker, motorola, samsung, lg, apple, rim, htc, whoever, nokia had the best,the best carrier relationships worldwide.
but nokia was seen as a mostly gentle giant, and one that mostly did not do harm to the ecosystem.
most of all, is the migration of symbian os to touch screens.
with the language support, the ecosystems nationally around the carriers and nokia grew meaningful in many cases.
the massive global market share dominance that windows and office have in the workplace.
so you buy yourself a lumia and then set it up to wake you for the next day to go to work - and will have a severe 'i hate nokia' moment when your phone rings silently without waking you up.
like the book publishing industry is doing in japan for example where mobile books outsell ebooks already.
lumia 800 (and 900) is utterly beyond the market price except for the rich elites, who will rather buy iphones, blackberries etc.
i started today's morning preparing to come back to work and my mind was buzzing with thoughts of the truly big picture.
the most trusted, most desired, most valued and loved brand.
and then the rep has to do the returns paperwork and packaging hassles.
in the emerging world market, where all the growth is now in dumbphones - nokia's market share is above 50%.
microsoft ended up selling over a billion copies of windows and for long times they had over 80% market share in the pc market, but pcs are not that widely spread across the planet, so microsoft never approacted 25% of the planet's population.
the 2010 flagship nokia smartphone, the n8, had a 12 mp camera and xenon flash.
meanwhile microsoft's windows phone was designed to work on very high spec components - in fact, windows phone does not even work on nokia's standard chip supplier equipment like texas instruments.
but it also often means cannibalization of the legacy services and their eco-systems.
but the opportunity is good when a new ceo comes in; the opportunity is greater still, if the company has been seeing a dangerous decline in profits.
that poisons the reputation both for friends recommending smartphones and the sales reps at the stores.
when i joined nokia in the 1990s, the networking side was the bigger side with most of the staff and most of the revenues.
nokia was not only the best phone brand essentially in every country outside of the usa, canada (and south korea and japan); but it was literally the most valued brand: period.
what of navteq, of nokia money, or mobile avertising, the ovi store, etc etc etc.
the flash on the lumia 800 is led, the first nokia flagships to go better was the n95 and n82 in 2007 with xenon flash.
the ceo is actively assassinating the brand in every way he can.
nonetheless, apple's iphone has an installed based (not cumulative shipments, but active users) of about 150 million smartphone users today.
it may be to microsoft's advantage that the customer doesn't buy a meego or symbian based smartphone - but that customer will then go to another brand - and in 9 times out o 10, it will be either an iphone or an android.
so the feature list is scrutinized far more thoroughly.
three times the effort for zero more commission - while the customer bitches and moans and gives the sales rep a bad day.
this, in the country that was about to become the world's biggest smartphone market.
the first point to make, is that the author, e.d. kain, had actually written a pair of articles about windows phone, this one yes in favor butalso another one against.
he could decide their specifications, their intended target markets and end-users.
nokia had a 5 megapixel camera when the iphone was introduced with only 2 megapixels.
where nokia smartphones tended not to be the coolest and sexiest in recent years, at least nokia was always known for stuffing every conceivable tech feature onto its flagship phones.
that would give the car 2 subscriptions (for a short duration) but then upon our person we'd go down from 3 subscriptions to 2, as one was temporarily assigned to the car.
this was not invented by blackberry.
so in the usa, on this lumia partnership, the conventional wisdom says that the microsoft brand will help restore nokia (on the brand).
battle of ecosystems elop preaches about the battle of ecosystems.
contrast that with the 2.1 billion people with a banking account as reported by the bbc last year.
zokem surveyed 10,000 smartphone owners in 2011 in the usa and europe and guess what was used most by smartphone users.
the finnish employment culture - and that at nokia - rewards loyalty and makes it difficult to lay off people.
obviously that is impossible, even with the iphone there is fragmentation (retina display for example so the screen resolutions are different in the 3 series and 4 series of iphones).
i am not suggesting the carriers/operators loved nokia - nokia was too big and powerful to be loved.
for the full year 2010, nokia was twice as big as its nearest rival.
i would be very confident in believing that at least the n8 will not be seen as a failure in its early reviews the way the n97 was received.
nokia had failed in the us market, so the nokia brand cannot help microsoft in the us market, that would need to be the other way around.
by nations of the top 25, 5 of the biggest companies come from the usa, 3 from china, 3 from japan, 2 from south korea, and 2 from france.
in 2013 the projection has 16 million symbian sales for a total of 80 million nokia smartphones.
but that is rare and would take years of competence to develop by the bookstore owners, and still would not be nearly as powerful as the amazon recommendation engine, in pinpointing exactly what kind of books i may like.
apple's sudden decline comes also at optimal timing for the new ceo of nokia.
else if you do touch screen, you are just another rival.
that was a lot of smoke-and-mirrors.
he could decide how to price them and support the launch with marketing.
the carriers/operators know they need the handsets, and smarpthones need operating systems to run.
the users absolutely love it, suggesting the phone seems to read your mind.. and taking those lessons, nokia launched nokia money in india and is enabling near field to all its new smartphones.
elop had a company that had growing sales, growing revenues, growing profits, and a growing share price - and turned that to losing sales, losing revenues, generating losses and a massively crashing share price (nokia's share price fell to less than half in the next five months).
so far up to now, the converged opportunity has always ended up far bigger than the initial industries that got into it.
so that is why i want to start with the consumer market where almost 4 out of 5 smartphones are sold.
well, actually that number is implausible because of the lack of electricity.
now our cumulative number hits 29.4 billion.
lumia series is pure touch screen only.
but we mentioned on this blog years ago, that artificial life's side-line product (their main business is tv-mobile interactive services like sms tv games etc) - a mobile java game called 'v-girl' the virtual girlfriend on your phone - sold 4 million copies.
before this action, nokia could control how advertising might appear on nokia branded smartphones.
and obviously, local developers can offer local apps in their home languages!
and in any case, if a customer wanting a nokia branded phone, is not walking out of the store with a nokia branded phone, that is a lost customer to nokia (and gain to apple or android).
no matter what the apple loyalists think of the iphone, it will never be a mass market phone.
they were used on par with mobile internet and far above apps.
the customer is far far more value-aware.
the third point raised by forbes is that with windows phone there will be uniformity across devices.
he could choose which type of models nokia would create - as these are truly new-from-the-ground-up smartphones, as they do not even use standard nokia components.
where ios and admob and others face strong competition in advertising from legacy mass media like tv, newspapers, radio etc; and obviously internet advertising - nokia's symbian platform is thedominant smartphone platform in all countries where legacy media is not established as a true 'mass' medium reaching even half of the population and where mobile access to the internet exceeds pc based access to the internet.
they are now idling because nokia sales have crashed.
and the one company that was replaced from the 2010 list - russia's biggest mobile operator by revenues, mts, was replaced by another bric company biggest operator - bharti airtel of india.
i didn't talk about the reality of the device as it is manufactured, whether design flaws or component problems or build quality etc.
same in the newsmedia or gaming or advertising or indeed money and banking and credit cards.
theguardian reported on this for example.
i have written another long blog explaining why skype is the ultimate red flag to carriers/operators.
he is in breach of stock market regulations and clearly hasacted with a confict of interest.
similarly for example notebook and netbook pcs are not counted for lenovo or samsung etc.
nokia did not make an utterly failing phone like the n97 or one with a technical error like the antennagate of the iphone 4.
the only way that is possible, is if smartphones have become less expensive at the low end of the price point.
the market changed drastically.
ford once sold more than half of all cars manufactured on the planet yes, but in no country was there a ford in the garages of 25% of the total population.
nokia phones are sold on more networks than any other phone brand and nokia has special partnership relationships with many carriers, ranging from the world's largest carrier/operator china mobile to the world's most advanced and demanding carrier/operator ntt docomo of japan (the carrier who launched the world's first cellular telecoms mobile business ie the company that started this industry).
google just told us last year that google makes 2.5 billion dollars of advertising revenues out of its mobile advertising arm.
then we have seat guru, which will tell me what in-flight electricity options are on that class of seat on that specific aircraft type on that particular airline.
but in all honesty, this won't happen to all people on the planet (kids for example) and definitely won't happen in one decade.
it is true that the dumbphone market is shifting to smartphones - they expect half of all new smartphones sold in the usa next year to be smartphones - that is happening in western europe now, and has already happened in some of the most advanced markets of the world - like my new home country of hong kong where half of all phones already are smartphones today.
the lumia battery is failing.
yet we can go to expedia or travelocity or opodo whatever travel site you want to use, and get to see dozens of flight options - and their prices - and their routes - and the actual aircraft used.
in reality, the top of the market is not the growth opportunity in smarpthones - all major analysts say, time and again, that the growth opportunity in smartphones is in the bottom of the price range, as smartphones go mainstream to the mass market consumers.
4 million is nothing amazing to the mobile industry.
by the next year, cameraphones alone outsold all types of stand-alone cameras (digital and film-based).
the reality is that in the past 12 months, nokia smartphones have been winning against the iphone, not losing to it.
so, even three years from now, the microsoft windows phone os family will have only about 5% market share.
and drool at the amazing opportunity that nokia business-oriented e-series smartphones can have with full microsoft office integration.
except that where cow herds can be big, cows are herding animals, so all the farmer needs to do, is connect the lead cow, and the others will follow.
in a small 'mom and pop' bookstore, if you were a loyal customer, you could perhaps gain the familiarity with the bookstore owner, to be able to get some recommendations.
nokia's market share of new sales in the summer of 2010 in britain was 33% according to kantar.
but after nokia jumps into bed with microsoft in 2012 the market share is not 20%, it will be.. 11%.in 2013 nokia and microsoft will not magically recover to 20%.
and it isn't even powered by nokia components like the cpu (the engine).
i could tell you that a gambler left las vegas with 100,000 dollars in his pocket.
in many cases a retired couple could get one ipad style device perhaps - to share among the pair.
nokia already sells basic non-touch screen smartphones at 100 dollars (price without subsidy, ie without contract, where the iphone without contract costs 600 dollars) and is pushing the price point of cheapest touch screen smartphones to that level too - already offering its cheapest touch screen smartphone at nearly 100 euros.
for example the phone will not wake up from the alarm.
i am however, very well aware that the banking and money industry moves very slowly, is very conservative.
and nokia would often time its mass market launches with particular precision - consider its 3g phones for example.
microsoft has been able to peddle thesheer impossibility of a 'third ecosystem' - which even microsoft loyalists would not have believed considering how ridiculous are ballmer-oriented claims about microsoft's future - but they suddenly believed it, when the nokia ceo said the same.
we hear of some great successes - more than half of helsinki area public transportation single tickes are sold via mobile, and all of parking in estonia is mobile, and now more than half of all banking accounts in kenya are mobile banking accounts.
there are three major business units at nokia which derive most of the revenues.
but the really weird part is, that nokia is pretty well poised to outperform its other big 5 handset maker rivals into the foreseeable future.
the engine your tata sportscar has, came from proton the cheap car maker in malaysia.
thus lumia will perform worse than nokia smartphones have done before.
no wonder that one of the us carriers refused to offer the glaring color options.
which brings us to the nokia magic with microsoft office suite integration.
nokia does not give us a breakdown of the s40 sales, but nokia recently celebrated the 1.5 billionth s40 cumulative shipment number.
you lost customers trying to shift them from dumbphones to smartphones.
nokia did not make an utterly failing phone like the n97 or one with a technical error like the antennagate of the iphone 4.
some premium ipods probably will offer the connectivity but even those, mostly will not connect to the cellular, and will rather connect via wifi).
but when smartphone users start to use the lumia, they soon are frustrated and disappointed.
the lumia 800 doesn't read usb thumb drives and memory sticks.
even the 'burning platforms obsolete' symbian based nokia (ovi) app store has twice that in apps.
analysys gave the q2 market shares for china in 2011 and nokia had crashed in one year to.. 22% with samsung and motorola nipping at nokia's heels.
i do not know anything about stephen elop except that he's a canadian, he ran microsoft's office unit and championed cloud computing at microsoft.
again a shift that nokia initiated and is mastering today with few real rivals (samsung the strongest to try this tactic too, with its bada based smartphones that were only launched earlier this year).
the market shares of those other 'big 5 handset makers' in smartphones was almost every quarter worse, than their share in dumphones.
from february 2011 to today, nokia has set a world record in destroying its market share.
it once made personal computers (primarily for the domestic finnish market, nokia's micromikko was an ibm-compatible pc running microsoft operating systems).
it too made windows mobile smartphones and it also did not see a fall, on the contrary, htc saw a growth in the usa on its market share.
artists could still sell tickets at concerts, so they shifted more of their income from selling albums to concerts.
customer surveys suggested only 2% of customers in the launch countries even considered a lumia.
but is it truly more important, that the ui is 'unique' - something no buyer asked for - or whether the operating system itself if useful, or the app store has tons of apps, or the camera is easy to use; etc.
what is even more insidious and will damage nokia's tattered reputation considerably, is the revellation that nokia and microsoft executives have been going to blogsites to argue with reviews if they were negative about lumia.
of the big media industries like print, broadcast and the related advertising industries, their migration into mobile has only started and is in the low single digits in percent of total revenues or total content delivered.
adjusted for growth, this time that would be 6.4 million units.
kodak has been in restructuring mode for 15 years – cutting headcount, closing factories, tightening belts and squeezing rocks for blood.
i have included their position also from the previous list and revenues last time so you see how the growth or decline has been.
it was not manufactured in nokia's world's most efficient and competent handset manufacturing factories.
nokia has traditionally been able to hold to the world's largest smartphone market share - a year ago nokia was literally not just bigger than the iphone, it was bigger than the iphone and all samsung smartphones - combined.
yet a child of 6 can do the same within a fraction of a second on google today.
nokia is again voluntarily abandoning a competitive advantage, which means lumia will perform less well than nokia was able to do in the past.
but the vast majority of nokia's business still today, is in 'dumbphones' ie the basic phones and the featurephones like say a cameraphone or a musicphone.
these were major surveys of all mobile phone owners.
the whole camera and video experience was always superior on nokia.
like the customer who has had a previous nokia and loved that its fm transmitter lets you connect to your car without an ipod cable connector.
disruption never asks for permission nokia said it would never release a touch screen phone, so someone else did - a software company.
but if you think about the real power and influence, real revenues, employees, etc, the above gives a good listing of who are the 25 biggest companies in mobile.
these number have been reported in hundreds of stories and the vast majority of those stories cheerfully reported that this was good news.
so lets look a bit at how far we've migrated into mobile.
yet the opportunities did not come from just fixed telecoms services like local and long distance calls and voicemail, or those enabled on mobile.
no, nokia doesn't need patent protection, and this wont' matter one iota in lumia's success or failure.
they don't like it, but they will do it, if there is money.
but i don't see someone coming to the store, and buying the lousy phone with the unique interface rather than the good phone with the familiar interface.
well, that is not really the end of the world, as long as it does have real ferrari components, except that when you look at the engine, you find it came not from ferrari's engine factory.
but the timing is close enough, that any 'revival' by nokia can be seen mirroring a decline by apple - and from now forward, it will be credited to the new ceo, even though he actually had nothing to do with that.
so the touch screen input is no better than any rivals, and is worse than the best.
proud owners walk with four year old models if they were top models way back when and so forth.
last quarter we have data for, q3, windows phone sales had fallen to about 500,000 units worldwide.
this was a pc maker company with a tiny global market share of about 3%, that made corporate losses in the mid 1990s, that found new profits by selling premium luxury smartphones.
one phone model costs 479 dollars, the next 529 dollars, another 499 dollars etc.
we heard from apple - the leader in app stores - earlier this year, that the total earned by the apple iphone app store last year was under a billion dollars.
it is literally the biggest fall of a global customer base, in any one year, of any company, in any industry - ever.
its r&d processes are slow, painfully slow compared to 'internet speed' rivals like say google.
and elop was hired - as then chairman of nokia jorma ollila said when introducing stephen elop -elop was hired to fix nokia problems in execution.
but compared to any other handset maker, motorola, samsung, lg, apple, rim, htc, whoever, nokia had the best,the best carrier relationships worldwide.
elop will have squandered the only chance nokia had had, to try to shift platforms, and blasted what any opportunity may have been left for lumia.
the camera industry boldly and bravely (and foolishly) thought mobile phone based cameraphones would never catch on, and never rival their industry.
it was a hard choice for chairman jorma ollila and his board, but once that decision was made, they did need a new ceo.
in the 'west' we have pcs at work and home.
but we should assume growth, so lets double that number and we arrive at 8 billion connected personal stand-alone (non mobile phone based) digital gadgets.
tomi's ebooks on mobile pearls pearls vol 1: mobile advertising tomi's first ebook is 171 pages with 50 case studies of real cases of mobile advertising and marketing in 19 countries on four continents.
i'll be the first to admit most consumers won't use most features and in recent years the smartphones have become so complex, even expert users couldn't work all parts of their phones.
and that, if we take the dozen industries mentioned in this blog (excluding travel, cars, hotels etc) is worth a cool 5 trillion dollars or about 9% of the total global economic spending of all economies on the planet.
in india and much of africa the access to electricity is so rare, that people often send the spare batteries to nearby towns or villages to be recharged (while using the other spare battery to power the phone).
the new ceo inherits a powerhouse mobile phone maker giant, which is on solid foundations, well positioned to reap benefits of the economic upturn, and well poised to capture a disproportionately large share of almost any conceivable mobile phone industry opportunities that can currently be seen on the horizon, including all flavors of smartphone opportunities from superphones to app stores.
south korea was the first country to make 'cards' out of credit cards optional - all credit card services are automatically enabled onto your mobile phone (instantly when the credit is approved), and if you want, a free plastic traditional credit card can be mailed in a few days also to your home address - if you so desire.
and they are very happy to quote reputable analyst houses who promised windows phone with nokia will reach 20% market share or better in smartphones.
i have not seen any recent nokia organizational charts, but probably there is room to cut some areas that drain managment resources but deliver little value to the bottom line.
to do that requires a step change in learning and self-improvement – this is achieved through continuous contemplation and self-reflection which ultimately enables the mastery of an aware self/organisation, with the motivation to pursue truly motivated goals.
digital editing of sound has enabled errors in sound quality to be 'fixed' - ie some boy bands and girl bands may have members who don't have good singing voices (perhaps are better dancers or just pretty on stage ) that can be increasingly 'fixed' electronically.
by every single criterion, nokia lumia is underperforming the market - and on most it is regressing from where nokia was before lumia.
microsoft could have called the new os anything.
there is a need to accept a lack of control, and of uncertainty, not only being prepared to accept being taken outside of one’s comfort zone but deliberately seeking it out – the consequence of which is a more disciplined mind or organisational culture, that is now capable of strong creative and conceptual thinking.
and this amazing transition they have done - consistently - while making the best profits of any big phone maker.
but the opportunity is good when a new ceo comes in; the opportunity is greater still, if the company has been seeing a dangerous decline in profits.
(again, us readers, don't be fooled about t-mobile contract price of 50 dollars for lumia 710, it costs many times more without the subsidy).
to seek new patterns that make sense even if they challenge pre-conceived ideas, positions and ways of doing things.
i do like the bold predictions to suggest big growth, to counter those who peddle the tired myth that we are somehow at saturation or near saturation in mobile.
this is not me saying the os is not top on the mind of smarpthone buyers, or the number of apps in the app store.
nokia partnered with german camera optics specialists carl zeiss, and from the early n-series on, nokia had far and away the best cameraphones in that part of the planet where 98% of its population lives (japan and south korea have exceptionally advanced domestic mobile phone markets).
if elop could have left symbian alone, he would be now reaping the benefits of all the hard work nokia did over the years.
maybe 2 or 3 thousand just to have some spare capacity, but not a million per forest..
even at the height of 'beetle mania' meaning the iconic volkswagen original beetle, there was not a vw for every fourth person on the planet.
now nokia branded smartphones, when using the microsoft windows phone os, will be subject to microsoft advertising concepts and spyware.
so, all you you out there who are screaming for nokia to shift now to android.
3 mobile subscriptions per person (not inconceivable, i for example walk around daily with 3 subscriptions, have done so since 2003).
this selling of a key nokia ecosystem component is how nokia's ceo communicates to his staff how his new management stops the competition from "taking our market share with an entire ecosystem."
by the next year, cameraphones alone outsold all types of stand-alone cameras (digital and film-based).
the customer is far far more value-aware.
now we know that stephen elop destroyed his company in february.
from that it is a very 'safe' projection - actually quite negative of this alliance, if separately they are worth 32% but combined they only do 20% or 22% or something like that.
a paper based traditional travel agent would never ever have that capacity, except perhaps for the few 'domestic' airlines that serve their home town.
so now the new microsoft smartphone os has the worst branding baggage out of the whole microsoft empire.
and the major media industries and advertising are headed to a pocket near you too.
there is indeed deep institutional resistance to real change.
nokia very literally scared away six out of every ten customers it had a year ago.
nokia could throw all at it, and microsoft would essentially then double that still.
this is not me saying the os is not top on the mind of smarpthone buyers, or the number of apps in the app store.
the mobile did cannibalize some of the fixed telecoms revenues (and skype probably took more of the fixed telecoms revenues than mobile) but today, the resulting combined telecoms industry is far bigger, about twice in size.
in many cases a retired couple could get one ipad style device perhaps - to share among the pair.
the office suite and some of its components like word, excel and powerpoint are clear market leaders in their fields.
it is literally the biggest fall of a global customer base, in any one year, of any company, in any industry - ever.
its not only the biggest fall ever witnessed in any one year by a global brand leader in technology such as computers or home electronics etc.
nonetheless, to sell a mobile advertising unit for a major handset maker goes totally against the grain, where rivals are investing more in advertising, not less.
and where nokia previously did have near retina display pixel density on the e90 communicator, nokia has again regresssed and now both lumia 900 and lumia 800 fall far short of the retina display sharpness of even the year-old iphone 4.
but the lumia 710 has a decidedly cheap look to it, very plasticky.
for me its ironic that mobile has contributed so much to this supercharged socially networked world.
that may be good for microsoft (which seems not to care in the least about suing everyone so it might even be seen as a drawback at redmond).
this happened while the global smartphone industry exploded in 2011 growing by 59% from the year before.
but nokia sells more than phone handsts.
in a small 'mom and pop' bookstore, if you were a loyal customer, you could perhaps gain the familiarity with the bookstore owner, to be able to get some recommendations.
the first generation of iphones would not even let users install apps to it!
that means apple is consigned to being a tiny nicheplayer which has a global market share of 2% of all phones sold (14% of all smartphones).
this time there is huge pent-up demand for nokia phones and almost no rival nokia handsets to steal any lumia sales.
so the second highest factor deciding which smartphone normal consumers buy, is brand.
they can actually tag trees in forests of a million trees.
that handset manufacturer was ...nokia.
plus nokia had removable storage media ie microsd cards so you could shoot many hours of dvd quality video and then just swap your microsd card and continue shooting.
the computer industry is going mobile.
android is 8 times bigger, apple iphone app store is literally 10 times bigger.
the blogosphere is very upset with nokia - perhaps less so with microsoft as it seems to be par for the course.
that is the right strategy for nokia (while it would not necessarily be the optimal strategy for a specialist niche maker like apple or rim).
in germany the same story, not even the top 10, not even for the december month.
this is the build quality you get when you outsource your factory.
lumia series is pure touch screen only.
we have intelligent dog collars for hunting dogs for example, and the dogs-to-humans translator (bowlingual) which translates dog sounds to sms messages for humans of what the dog is trying to say.
so says comscore in 2011 - said 83% of europeans and 68% of us phone owners sent sms text messages.
yes the usa, known for such fantastic global hit phones as the palm, the danger, the hp, the compaq, the motorola - anyone remember the rokr - and yes, microsoft's own magnificent kin, the phone so disasterous, it was terminated 6 weeks after launch.
what does convergence enable remember that converence gives us new opportunities of better experiences and as an industry, vast new opportunities.
android has been killing microsoft and palm, and damaging apple - while symbian (and blackberry) has been barely touched.
water, electricity and gas metering.
the lumia doesn't have fm radio, nokia added it gosh, years ago, about 2005.
it will probably take you half an hour to complete this article but i promise you, it is stuffed with facts, stats, insights and goodies.
this is the desperation move by the small rival who tries by a few cosmetic tricks to expand its product line.
the microsoft windows phone is not a strong brand in smartphones and neither is nokia.
then we have seat guru, which will tell me what in-flight electricity options are on that class of seat on that specific aircraft type on that particular airline.
same in the newsmedia or gaming or advertising or indeed money and banking and credit cards.
obviously that is impossible, even with the iphone there is fragmentation (retina display for example so the screen resolutions are different in the 3 series and 4 series of iphones).
the nokia strength has been exceptional qwerty keyboards.
nokia has a history of truly exceptional feel to its top phones.
nokia had secured 'carrier billing' relationships with over 100 carriers worldwide for ovi (no other rival app store had even one quarter that level - carrier billing means one-click payments that get charged directly off your phone bill or prepaid account.
and it isn't even powered by nokia components like the cpu (the engine).
and then you find out, the car was designed by the tractor factory designers from zetor in russia.
this is the second most used ability of the mobile phone.
i reflected on a conversation i had 48 hours earlier with another global company (different industry sector) - their view was that by looking 40 years into the future if they carried on doing what they had been doing they would not exist as a company.
you are landing in the coolest job on the planet and may your reign be long and prosperous.
roughly a quarter of all cars in south korea are already connected to the internet.
we can book our seat and pay for the ticket and get a boarding pass to the phone, but we still need an airplane to burn jet fuel to fly from one airport to another.
the ovi store was nothing, nobody and nowhere in the usa and no doubt when elop flew every week from finland to his other home in seattle usa, he felt ovi was a failure.
for those pundits who obsess about the touch screen ui leadership - which apple clearly holds over any rivals in handsets - there are dozens of other issues of phone feature (and price) factors where nokia has mastered most, and is getting ever better at the touch screen too.
which file standards does the media player support.
it is abandoned with the first 3 lumia phones.
and the microsoft windows phone cavalry will not arrive in time to save nokia.
so the nokiasiemens networking unit has been fighting a brave fight in a loss-making industry and turned it around to generate modest profits - that is a very good sign of good management.
now we know that stephen elop destroyed his company in february.
this is corporate suicide.
for the second most important factor for smartphone buyers, the brand - both brands are so poisonous, this is the classic comment, two turkeys do not an eagle make.
and for the car makers, it makes no sense to split their data traffic to many mobile operators, rather to accumulate their total traffic load and negotiate with all carriers/mobile operators to get the best bulk deal for the whole fleet of cars, on one network.
nokia could sell advertising to its own smartphones.
zokem surveyed 10,000 smartphone owners in 2011 in the usa and europe and guess what was used most by smartphone users.
reason 13 - hostile carrier relations with microsoft nokia was known to be friendly to carriers if bureaucratic and uncompromising.
i honestly am not even googling his background now - i am sitting at a starbucks in toronto, waiting for my next meeting appointment, and am drafting this article with a nice tall cup of cappuchino.
andnow elop wants to cause all that confusion by discontinuing the ovi store brand.
nokia introduced tv out in 2006 meaning you could watch your pictures, websites, videos etc on your home tv.
the value of just that advertising runs in the millions except that nokia got it for free.
elop single-handedly wiped out nokia's demand in february 2011.
the multitouch interface, on capacitive touch screen, and apple's brilliant, logical and intuitive software system, all worked.
elop had carte blanche to overspend on the launch marketing activities as much as he wanted, and obviously no other ceo in any other situation would have approved as extravagant marketing budgets for just any year's 'regular' flagship model launch.
norway was the first country to let you submit your tax return by mobile.
and you cannot transfer apps and various content via bluetooth etc.
this 'flagship' phone seems like it was designed by total amateurs who were somehow utterly ignorant of the vast competence nokia had built over the past decade.
at the end of last year we reached mid-point, where half of all internet users accessed the web at least part of the time using a mobile phone (which includes the simple wap type of mobile internet usage common in many parts of the emerging world markets).
but when smartphone users start to use the lumia, they soon are frustrated and disappointed.
the ceo is actively assassinating the brand in every way he can.
the north american market situation is the trickiest communication problem.
these cheap phones in 2009 had an average price of 100 dollars (that has come down since then).
it should be said, that the telecoms networking business has been a huge drain on most major telecoms vendors - motorola's networking unit went bankrupt, ericsson's was loss-making for many years, nortel of canada went bankrupt and lucent from the usa, also loss-making, was sold to alcatel of france.
i can't 'prove' prove it to you, but it is very widely accepted by experts in the industry, that nokia's resale channel froze in february and nokia products were removed from displays etc.
so you dig more and you find out, that this car wasn't painted by ferrari in its colors, it was painted by kia the cheap car maker of south korea.
but.. the burning platforms memo is 1 year old.
the sales reps hate returns - because the customer has to be sold another model smartphone - but the sales rep won't get a new commission.
i can make some very general assumptions but honestly i have never met the man, cannot comment on his management style etc.
by definition, all new born humans between 2010 and 2020 will still be pre-teens by the end of the decade.
i am also including a fortune global 500 rank equivalent for those which would have qualified for the fortune global 500 based solely on their mobile business and what ranking they would have had.
artists would compile 'albums' of about 15 songs, sold at a price far greater than the one hit that currently made the artist popular on the charts.
nokia lumia has gotten good reviews for its appearance but nothing beyond that.
if you seriously believe that microsoft can win enterprise/corporate customers of any meaningful degree with nokia, you are deluding yourself.
so while we in the industrialized world can at least theoretically have a good impression about microsoft and windows, and it can 'help' in the branding battles - top priority please remember, then in the emerging world countries the microsoft brand is no help and easily a hindrance.
yes, nokia should be able to do better than it is doing, but every other big 5 handset maker has seen either quarterly losses, or severely declining profits in the past few years, including nokia's nearest true rival - samsung.
and blackberry obviously owns a lions's share of that market.
plus nokia had removable storage media ie microsd cards
the advice and guidance of peers and friends is seeked even more than we might do.
the total global mobile phone app market last year was worth 5 billion dollars (said chetan sharma consulting).
we just lost 2.4 billion connections and a further 800 million metering connections.
nokia which could easily do this, rather has made three variations of one boring theme.
the telecoms industry is far along the way.
yet elop is doing everything he can to sink that nokia-controlled first ecosystem and replace it with what microsoft tries to call the 'third ecosystem' ie windows phone, which only reaches the pockets of less than 12 million people in the world, and is legitimately called at best, the 8th ecosystem.
ok, lets take the uae example (this is abu dhabi, dubai etc the oil-rich emirates on the arabian peninsula).
remember that nokia's last succesful flagship - the n95 - handily outsold the iphone globally.
the smartphone apps portfolio is ranked only tied for 5th/6th highest priority for buyers of new smartphones.
even better than that, nokia's operating system for smartphones, symbian, is so huge, it powers half of all smartphones in use on the planet.
so, all you you out there who are screaming for nokia to shift now to android.
if we assume one car-related subscription that comes with the new car when we buy it, to connect to the maps and security systems and self-diagnostics and on-board games etc - we only add 1 billion mobile subscriptions to the planet.
if they do, they are often linux based pcs (or have pirated microsoft software which may be very buggy etc).
nothing about it is a nokia, except that the ceo has the nerve to stick a nokia badge on the phone and claim it is a genuine nokia.
thats the 4th major smartphone player, and the third of fortune global 500 rivals to quit the smartphones race.
it says a lot about nokia that symbian survived this transition where palm died and microsoft found the transition so difficult it killed off the windows mobile platform to launch a totally new one, called phone 7 - while its market share crashed from near 20% to 2% in just four years.
it may be difficult for older readers in the western industrialized countries who see the long lines of cameras and accessories sold at the electronics stores, yet the numbers are perfectly clear.
the mobile did cannibalize some of the fixed telecoms revenues (and skype probably took more of the fixed telecoms revenues than mobile) but today, the resulting combined telecoms industry is far bigger, about twice in size.
i have included their position also from the previous list and revenues last time so you see how the growth or decline has been.
sure, like madonna said to wayne and garth, and monkeys might fly out of my butt.
how awesome is that for mr elop, he gets the media attention for being the new guy, and he has a wonderful story to tell, where he does not need to 'fix nokia' but rather just elaborate clearly what nokia is doing.
it would still not be as thorough as any google search today, and it would take years to learn the skills and days of research in the library.
so today any symbian phone can do full microsoft office fully and all its peripherals and apps.
they have not been afraid to abandon businesses that did not show promise for the future.
but you can't because the slab is high like a curb, and maybe you'll try to reach to turn off the ignition just as she starts to dive.
what are the profitable opportunities in mobile for a phone maker.
remember, for any ios media partner - including any advertising, we need to add the other ios users, ipads and ipod touch'es, so the total reach of the ios currently is about 240 million.
if thats not enough for you, there is the microsoft marketing machine.
i have given you evidence and facts and stats and end-user surveys, showing what smartphone users do, and what smartphone users want, and what other factors influence the purchase decision ie the carrier relationshiops the corporate purchase departments.
so mobile can only influence a small part of the travel experience, whether in airplanes or hotels or trains etc.
customer surveys suggested only 2% of customers in the launch countries even considered a lumia.
it may be difficult for older readers in the western industrialized countries who see the long lines of cameras and accessories sold at the electronics stores, yet the numbers are perfectly clear.
lg's strategic partership with microsoft bled the company profits into losses and lg ran to android.
the massive global market share dominance that windows and office have in the workplace.
last night i got off a call which i say was interesting with a major telco that is interested in working with me and the principles ofno straight lines.
these cheap phones in 2009 had an average price of 100 dollars (that has come down since then).
apple's iphone or indeed none of apple's products compete directly with 2/3 of nokia's business (the dumbphones and the networks).
the perfection in the camera shutter on the n93 or the precision of the hinges on the e90 communicator or the sheer delight of engineering bliss that is the slider/folder motion in the e7.
the sad thing is, that usually with new lines, nokia has done a pair, ie the n8 was the tablet style pure touch screen, and its sister model was the e7 with the qwerty slider.
maybe that is not a big surprise, they have been predicting the pocket computer for two decades already.. the media industries are more interesting.
but again, if we need a car to get us from point a to point b, until they invent teleportation, we will keep needing that car (or some rival like a bicycle or bus etc).
it adds your keys to your home and car, the pass-keys to your office, your identity card, and now as the phone collects your payment behavior, they have launched the mobile consierge to the phone, to help manage your life.
suddenly in relation to the new technologies, the old habits and regulations become obstacles, the old services and infrastructures are found wanting, the old organisations and institutions inadequate.
yes, even while switching to the newer os, and giving it more than a year for 'ramp up'microsoft lost again half of what customers remained.
nokia used to have the platinum-standard carrier relationships a year ago.
the uae became the first country to pass 200% mobile phone subscriptions per capita.
its the ultimate job for someone hungry to make a name as a miracle-maker in high tech.
whatever nokia was able to do in 2010, today nokia will do far worse, whether in the usa or rest of the world.
he is not just a microsoft guy, he was previously with several other it companies based in the usa.
and this is all before we start to enable my flight itself with mobile check-in, or the hotel does a mobile phone enabled locks to my hotel room etc.
but sufficient to say that clearly more than half of consumer uses of telling time - and of the wake-up alarm - is now from the mobile phone.
such abilities are impossible in traditional bookstores.
and when the price is about the same, on the look and feel, the lumia is the clear loser already in the store.
and in the uk, nokia was the phone brand with the highest loyalty (not the iphone or blackberry which were a lot in the news for big market gains).
compared to nokia's previous flagships and current rivals.
note, at this time, microsoft smartphones were made by samsung, lg and motorola - the top 3 bestselling phone brands of the usa - which did not experience a significant change in their market shares!
in the global brand survey of 2010 by interbrand, nokia finished 8th best brand ahead of such icons as rolls royce, rolex, mercedes benz, porsche etc.
nokia smartphones used to come with a huge array of pre-loaded apps and the devices were overloaded with technological goodies.
whatever you think of nokia's success in the past, whether you applaud it or are aghast, the performance of lumia will be worse.
remember, for any ios media partner - including any advertising, we need to add the other ios users, ipads and ipod touch'es, so the total reach of the ios currently is about 240 million.
the global picture tells the same story.
no: ex windows phone general manager at microsoft, charlie kindel, who acknowledges that microsoft had further angered the carriers in 2011.
in rough terms the installed base of s40 currently is more than 700 million, so when added together, symbian and s40 give nokia an addressable market potential of 1 billion mobile phone users worldwide.
in fact, it has severe shortcomings with no foldering, so the more you install apps, the more cluttered and clumsy it becomes.
even though nokia designed three very similar spec smartphones (and nokia has tons of qwerty phones on symbian, s40 and meego operating systems).
nokia overall corporate profits grew .
not everybody will return lumias.
microsoft used its scale to crush apple, even where mac was always better.
so by december 2013, the world will have about 111 million windows phone smartphones in use.
we know the market share crashed, sales revenues crashed and nokia profits vanished.
nokia has traditionally been able to hold to the world's largest smartphone market share - a year ago nokia was literally not just bigger than the iphone, it was bigger than the iphone and all samsung smartphones - combined.
they pay very close attention to every player in the market.
that is nothing new, once there was a huge need of typing skills at major offices, typing pools, before the word processor and email made most of their typing work redundant.
but why none of its strategies worked was  because the company took too long and sat on its duff watching digital photography come and eat it for a mid-day snack even though kodak r&d helped with the digital photo revolution when it launched the first digital camera in 1975.
nokia did the (non japan/non-s korea) world's first 8mp cameraphone and first 12mp cameraphone.
this is not proof of an os that is ready for prime time.
in countries like pakistan and bangladesh the electrical grid is shut off several times.. per day .. to conserve energy.
the reality is that recently the iphone market share has been declining (four quarters in a row) where nokia's market share held steady or actually grew.
and the nsn unit is a drain on profitability, even if they manage miniscule profits in the unit.
it was a hard choice for chairman jorma ollila and his board, but once that decision was made, they did need a new ceo.
we actually have another issue with the homes too.
the blogosphere is very upset with nokia - perhaps less so with microsoft as it seems to be par for the course.
we thought that each household would have 6 connected gadgets.
he damages the nokia version (or in this case sells it).this destroys a nokia native advantage 'in a war of ecosystems' and instead brings nokia ever more to the full control of microsoft, as its slave.
and obviously my view already now as we await the nokia q4 numbers for lumia is, that based on his behavior in the past year, elop has mismanaged his company so totally, that he may not be allowed to continue running nokia.
apple surrendered to nokia and now pays nokia not just for every iphone made, but apple also paid a lump sum to compensate nokia for the patent infringements of early iphones.
the (former) director general of the bbc said that all broadcast content will be available on mobile (and bbc's successful iplayer is a perfect example of how a broadcaster can take a big slice out of the digital convergence into mobile).
no matter what any expert may have said about how obsolete symbian was or how horrible ovi store was or how bad the software was, the one thing everybody agrees about nokia, its build quality has always - always - been the best in the world.
so i argue, to survive organisations have to disrupt themselves before someone else does it to them.
the uae became the first country to pass 200% mobile phone subscriptions per capita.
and when you think about it, if google's android has about 45% and apple's iphone between 15% and 20%, then if nokia and microsoft can get 20% - game on.
so if we count nokia branded qt ecosystem potential reach, it is well in excess of 1 billion pockets.
they are not as good as (when considering the touch screen only) as the iphone is - but who is, honestly, this is comparing a ferrari to a toyota for goodness sake - but nokia's touch screen phones are getting better every generation.
whatever success or lack therof, you have seen of nokia in the business/enterprise space, that will do worse on lumia and windows phone, not better.
that doesn't matter, we now have an ex microsoft executive,
similarly hp, which bought palm (but has since discontinued that business) didn't make it to the top 25.
he gave10 reasons why windows phone will fail.
you will fling a couple of birds angrily at some pigs and no doubt say 'apps'.
this means lumia is worse off than nokia was before the elop effect.
if the consumer wants to buy a stand-alone mp3 player, that will then have very particular music needs, and that person will definitely own a smartphone also, towards the second half of this decade.
its not only the biggest fall ever witnessed in any one year by a global brand leader in technology such as computers or home electronics etc.
even blackberry has been seeing declines in market share.
mobile cannot cannibalize the whole car market like it can't cannibalize the air travel market or the hotel industry etc.
if lumia sales are below 4 million, lumia has failed to an unacceptable degree.
it bought siemens's giant but loss-making networking unit, and turned it around and now nokiasiemens networks makes some profits, in a sector of the industry where profits are very rare to see.
its very very bloody in the smartphone wars.
what if you find out that your 'genuine' ferrari was not actually manufactured in a ferrari factory in maranello italy.
and add to that the android installed base (qt supports android) and potentially blackberry (the new blackberry os will be compatible with qt) - the nokia 'first ecosystem' if built around qt has a potential reach of more than 1.35 billion mobile phone users (more than 5x bigger than the total ios ecosystem or the android ecosystem; more than 12 times bigger than the total blackberry ecosystem and more than 100 times bigger than the windows phone).
advertising goes where the media audiences go.
and nokia is also a smartphone maker - the biggest in the industry, with the best-selling smartphone os as well.
which brings us to the nokia magic with microsoft office suite integration.
the chief executive officer of nokia had lost the trust of the owners of the company, and therefore, could not really sustain the trust of the board either.
lets connect these all to 3g networks.
contrast that with the 2.1 billion people with a banking account as reported by the bbc last year.
the victims of natural and man-made disasters will not be accumulating multiple it devices.. 50 billion is not plausible
the fourth most important factor is themodel of the smartphone handset of any given brand.
norway was the first country to let you submit your tax return by mobile.
we are looking at the biggest economic prize of our lifetimes, and it is 'in play' as we speak, with fortune 500 giants like nokia, apple, google, hewlett-packard, vodafone, microsoft, sony, samsung etc all angling to be one of the winners in this ultimate race of the decade, perhaps even the race of the century.
pocket music players including the ipod sell about 127 million units (same source for all).
so by faulty leap of logic, many see that nokia is somehow 'losing to iphone' (or android or blackberry).
hearing about kodaks resignation and demise also got me thinking about nokia, and indeed other organisations and industries that struggle and fail as they were unable to adjust to what was them an ambiguous world.
nokia voluntarily abandons nearly half of the addressable market and instead - forces, forces all lumias to be compared to iphones (rather than compared to blackberries).
that to me speaks excellent management in very difficult conditions.
the sad fact is, that on qwerty the keyboard on the e7 is truly magnificent.
and managements at very big global corporations do make investment decisions and product commitment decisions based on some very serious calculations.
the carriers/operators know they need the handsets, and smarpthones need operating systems to run.
this was a pc maker company with a tiny global market share of about 3%, that made corporate losses in the mid 1990s, that found new profits by selling premium luxury smartphones.
i did a meticulous calculation of the futility of investing in apps today, and showed with rigorous analysis and facts that half of developers of paid apps will not make a profit in less than 11 years, and for the free apps (ie used in advertising and marketing) the prospects are far worse than that even.
there are many more industries, more small ones, that also are impacted by mobile, like cameras, music, videogaming, the watches and clocks industry etc, but those are so small (all under 100 billion dollars in size) that i won't spend much time on them now.
mobile cannot cannibalize the whole car market like it can't cannibalize the air travel market or the hotel industry etc.
its quite feasible for samsung or htc to spam nokia branded smartphones via the windows phone ad platform.
such abilities are impossible in traditional bookstores.
what is even more insidious and will damage nokia's tattered reputation considerably, is the revellation that nokia and microsoft executives have been going to blogsites to argue with reviews if they were negative about lumia.
nokia knows how to do that.
i could tell you that a gambler left las vegas with 100,000 dollars in his pocket.
the usa relationships were particularly damaged.
symbian is plagued with fragmentation (although it was getting less so) and android is seeing more and more of it.
i started today's morning preparing to come back to work and my mind was buzzing with thoughts of the truly big picture.
if nokia abandoned all that leadership, and surrendered to the whims of google, that would be a colossal mistake.
so, even three years from now, the microsoft windows phone os family will have only about 5% market share.
symbian supports such vital business needs as.. folder (windows phone does not) and full multitasking and the transfers of apps and files via bluetooth.
by divesting nsn, nokia could focus more on its core business - related to handsets - and instantly get a jump on the profitability of the company.
he is in breach of stock market regulations and clearly hasacted with a confict of interest.
they don't like it, but they will do it, if there is money.
so in sum about nokia today, it is the biggest, most dominant dumbphone maker.
yes, symbian too has lost market share, but very little.
bright ferrari red, the prancing horse logo and all.
so i argue, to survive organisations have to disrupt themselves before someone else does it to them.
even the lumia 710 is just a cheaper lame version of the lumia 800.
if you don't know the history of how devastating microsoft has been to its 'strategic partners' in mobile, like the vampire, its bled them dry.
so, earlier this week, we had the very first major industry analyst house issue a fresh, post elop effect, forecast for nokia and microsoft windows phone.
it was not designed by nokia's top designers from finland.
nokia has taken its customer base and walked it in front of a firing squad, and shot it dead.
that changed last year when the advertising industry woke up seriously to mobile.
yes, its share price has taken a battering recently, but even then - in the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, when all rival giant global handset makers stumbled, nokia came through with flying colors, its handset unit profitable every single quarter.
if you really love your qwerty look, you won't even consider these lumias.
they say that windows phone would reach about 37 million unit sales this year and 64 million in 2013.
nokia's touch screen interface will not need to be 'better' than the iphone - nor even 'as good as' the iphone, as long as nokia's touch screen interface is 'good enough'.
they only sell 2% of the world's total mobile phone handset market today, but its such a huge market, that it powers the majority of apple's revenues and the majority of apple's profits.
when did nokia go mad i happen to know the mobile advertising side of the mobile content and media industry quite well, as i was the first person to discuss commercially launched mobile ads at any international conference (in austria) literally within weeks after they had launched (in finland in year 2000).
nokia didn't need to pay one penny to apple.
and while some companies are often in the news, like say microsoft, a big giant in the it industry, by its mobile revenues, microsoft isn't even close to entering the chart.
we just heard from christmas electronics sales in the usa, that digital camera sales and videocam sales had fallen catastrophically - because consumers were switching their camera and video capture to their smartphones.
i do not know anything about stephen elop except that he's a canadian, he ran microsoft's office unit and championed cloud computing at microsoft.
that made the smartphone space one of the most competitive of any industries on the planet, with probably more global giant rivals than any other industry ever in the same space.
i have no idea how many household pets there are, but i think its safe to say, the proportion of pets is far less than the total number of households, even as some households may have more than one pet.
morgan stanley forecasts that in 2012 nokia will sell 40 million symbian based smarphones so the total for 2012 for nokia is 77 million.
while nokia and microsoft have been repeating the 20% numbers from those big analyst houses, as recently as october of 2011, the reality is, that those numbers are not news in october.
if anything, nokia was known as the brand that did sms texting just about as well as it could be done.
apple brought a new era to pcs (but was unable to capture a major part of that new world).
the n8 was so good, that the first side-by-side test with htc's titan ii - with a 16mp camera, and the n8 produced better pictures.
funny to say that, one billion is not much...  but yes, adding cars, we're at 21.4 billion so far.
the decision to sell the mobile advertising unit at nokia wascertainly not to the best interests of nokia and nokia's ecosystem.
that means apple is consigned to being a tiny nicheplayer which has a global market share of 2% of all phones sold (14% of all smartphones).
all is not peachy so far its been a love-fest here with the communities dominate blog admiring nokia..
the handset industry is different from the pc industry or home electronics, in that the carriers/operators decide which phone succeeds and which fails (witness the short-lived microsoft kin).
and then just make sure as ceo, that those profits will now turn into growth again, as the economy improves - and probably with some strategic decisions about focus areas.
forbes said windows phone would have less patent wars.
nokia will never generate as huge profit margins as apple, but if nokia's profits turn now from decline into growth - then stephen elop will be seen as the savior, the miracle-maker, the man who defeated the apple iphone challenge and saved nokia.
so that is why i want to start with the consumer market where almost 4 out of 5 smartphones are sold.
but.. the burning platforms memo is 1 year old.
and you are not quite familiar with all ferrari models, so you then talk with your friend and then you go to the internet to see the actual details about this particular ferrari model.
but while tech analysts marvel at the iphone (and androids now), the touch screen is not the only 'preferred' form factor, nor the 'decisive' purchase criterion.
in the 'west' we have pcs at work and home.
so that was the 'old' microsoft mobile.
lets work on the upside and say, on average there is a pet in one third of all households (my guess is that the number is smaller but no doubt someone among our readers will know it).
it has only passed 50,000 apps.
this is what smartphone owners in the usa, britain, spain, australia, germany, france, canada, singapore etc have said.
and readers, this is again one of those ultra-long tomi ahonen essays, about 16,000 words (more than a full chapter in a hardcover book) so go get yourself a good cup of coffee before you start.
but as this blog is a mobile industry blog, it does make sense to put the big companies in context, especially across the operators, handset makers and infrastructure providers.
nokia was perfectly poised to fight for this low-cost price segment with symbian, because symbian was designed to work on very modest technological requirements and often these ultra-low cost smartphones are not touch screen devices.
i counted that in 2006 there were 7 of the fortune global 500 biggest companies on the plant, who made a smartphone.
it would be an interesting market analysis to count all gaming-oriented smartphones (like the iphone, most downloaded apps are games after all, the iphone can be said to be the first globally successful gaming phone platform to rival the nintendo and playstation portable..) and their value into the videogaming software value, the proportion would be bigger still.
so if you thought that perhaps the internet was threatening your business, that may be a short-lived threat, say for industries already feeling the full threat like bookstores or video rentals or music stores or travel agencies etc.
ford once sold more than half of all cars manufactured on the planet yes, but in no country was there a ford in the garages of 25% of the total population.
he is a north american, he knows the way to talk to north american press and analysts and investors - that is where most of nokia shares are held.
the issues range from network coverage to service reliability to network technology to service offering and pricing etc.
yes, nokia should be able to do better than it is doing, but every other big 5 handset maker has seen either quarterly losses, or severely declining profits in the past few years, including nokia's nearest true rival - samsung.
nokia cultivated the partnership model with its app store, ovi, and its content and its networked services such as maps, advertising, mobile payments etc.
kodak, minolta, polaroid, konica and so many other major camera industry players had to abandon the camera related business and shift to something else like professional imaging or scientific instrumentation or photocopiers or whatever, or else go bankrupt - like polaroid has done, twice already.
note, at this time, microsoft smartphones were made by samsung, lg and motorola - the top 3 bestselling phone brands of the usa - which did not experience a significant change in their market shares!
a billion may seem like a "big number" to those who don't understand mobile, but hey, crazy frog the ringing tone - yes just one - one - ringing tone - sold half a billion dollars - in paid downloads to mobile phone users - in one year - three years before apple even opened up its app store.
and nokia owned the low-cost smartphone space.
this is what i found: reason 1 - messaging madness: nokia has a natural strength in messaging-oriented smartphones (the most used feature of all mobile phone owners from africa to the usa is messaging, including smartphone owners).
microsoft has good brands such as xbox and office suite but its windows brand is weak and in mobile, it is poisonous.
nokia's brand has been damaged very badly in the past year.
you cannot win the world that way.
they try to erase the known unknowns.
apple can focus exclusively on its super-premium luxury smartphone, the iphone, releasing only one new model per year, putting all its effort to create genuine most-desirable masterpieces, much like a ferrari or porsche in cars.
he has sold various nokia assets from several sets of nokia's prime patents, to a whole handset factory in romania.
no antennagates at nokia.
there are literally thousands of news stories parroting that 20% number and the third ecosystem baloney.
coming from microsoft's unit looking at the future of the pc side, cloud computing etc - will give particular insights into what kind of synergies may be useful in the near future - in evaluating the value of nsn to nokia as a strategic asset, or whether they try to get rid of it now while it is marginally profitable.
elop took that growth and torpedoed it, and for 2011 nokia global market share collapsed from 29% in q4 of 2010 to about 12% in q4 of 2011 (we will know when nokia releases its q4 results shortly).
a survey of nearly 2,000 consumers of the uk mobile phone market by right mobile phone found that the mobile phone brand is more influential in deciding the next phone, than the carrier/operator brand.
so the internet has migrated 50% in 13 years.
yes, there are cows that are called to milk via an old mobile phone or beeper hanging on their neck, and when the cow hears the arrival of sms (or the ringing of a phone call - no danger, the cow won't answer so there won't be billable calling traffic to the farmer) the cow knows to come home to be milked.
the modern way to do utilities metering is with a digital meter, connected wirelessly to the network.
if we split that by weeks, its 1,000 trees cut per week.
or take the global internet and all its revenues out of google adwords and broadband fees etc, all of the internet revenues - and multiply that by 20.
nokia's flagship phones have always, always had the best cameraphones (japan, s korea blah-blah-blah).
elop single-handedly wiped out nokia's demand in february 2011.
and nokia's basic handset (dumbphones) unit is also profitable, and while its networking unit had struggled for a few years after nokia bought the loss-making networking unit from former giant rival siemens, nokia networking management very efficiently turned that loss-making business around, and now the combined entity is profitable - albeit only marginally so.
the decision to sell the mobile advertising unit at nokia wascertainly not to the best interests of nokia and nokia's ecosystem.
i do think that the very superficial view to stephen elop's past suggest he could be a great ceo for nokia.
apple does it thumbing its nose at industry standards and quarrels with major players like its long-standing feud with adobe flash.
it will probably take you half an hour to complete this article but i promise you, it is stuffed with facts, stats, insights and goodies.
it is very likely that the current new about-to-be released version is good enough (that powers the n8) but even if its not quite there yet, nokia will keep evolving and improving the touch screen parts of the os, and will become good enough, soon enough.
cnn for example was promoting its symbian smartphone app worldwide on countless daily ads on all cnn channels.
we get vastly superior services for consumers when we seek opportunties out of digital services.
not so often the actual inventor (japan's ntt docomo has most true inventions in the mobile space), but being the fast follower, nokia was well picking winning concepts (cameraphones, consumer smartphones) but made its stumbles too (n-gage).
camera, psp so then we have the other stand-alone digital gadgets, like the advanced digital cameras by canon, nikon etc; or the portable gaming systems like the nintendos and playstatoin portables.
nokia unattributed executive said lumia sales were "getting good traction" and "we are pleased with the early results".
nokia is offering ever cheaper 'africa phones' and keeps providing features and abilites that many rivals ignore, specific to the less wealthy customers - replacable batteries, critical in countries of poor electricity supply - in-built fm radios - surprisingly for many in the poorest countries the first ever fm radio they have owned, is the one that comes with the new nokia phone.
i also like the guidance by the mobilists and futurists, who look at the past decade, observe that mobile grew 10-fold in that decade, faster than any other technology of significant size - and then to argue that the same rate of growth would continue this decade, another full decade of growth of 10-fold.
so, last year with only normal launch, with a tight schedule which could not be changed (the n8 and s^3 were delayed to an embarrassing degree), with only modest marketing budget (nokia had just recovered from a quarterly loss)
the practise is ending, but there are still phones in the pipeline that don't allow battery changes - like the lumia 900.
yes, from small things, big things can grow.
in reality that is a market anomaly that applies to north america only, where only 8% of the planet's mobile phones are sold.. nokia utterly dominates the rest of the world (with the exception of those countries where strong domestic rivals control that country, south korea, japan and yes, the usa).
and the buyer has worked far more for that dollar than we have had to for our dollar.
then we have issues with poverty, with illiteracy (800 million people of reading age are illiterate worldwide - illiterates will not need a laptop surely, and probably won't have much need of more than one phone in most cases), with wars, famines, and refugees.
samsung does just on its galaxy series the obvious iphone clone basic slab touch screen versions of almost exactly iphone physical size; and then offers the galaxy indulge with the qwerty slider; the galaxy beam with the pico projector; and the galaxy note with its gigantic screen.
as i witnessed when i delivered my keynote to the mobile marketing association global event in the meccha of advertising, manhattan of the mad men of madison avenue haha, the big global ad agencies are all ramping up their competences in mobile, and i am witnessing it myself with far greater interest now in my mobile marketing workshops and seminars, such as delivering a keynote to the big mma event in sao paulo this week.
if you always wanted a ferrari but couldn't afford it, perhaps you bought yourself a toyota mr 2 sportscar or a ford mustang.
same with the n9 (pure touch screen) and its sister the n950 (with qwerty slider).
note, the car may have multiple subscriptions, as we may for example use our normal phone service, take out the sim card from the phone and insert it into the car's sim card slot.
in india for example nokia was toppled in 2011 from being the topmost brand.
if they do, they are often linux based pcs (or have pirated microsoft software which may be very buggy etc).
so doing your microsoft business solution is far better on a symbian e-series phone than with windows phone!
in smartphones nokia's market share fell from 29% in q4 of 2010, to 12% of q4 of 2011.
if elop is only an average manager, he will achieve 6.4 million in his sleep.
the biggest country by population is china.
i have written time and again, that nokia was struggling in 2009 to 2010, and fired its ceo kallasvuo, replacing him with elop.
no, cows won't get us there.
we get vastly superior services for consumers when we seek opportunties out of digital services.
it is very likely that the current new about-to-be released version is good enough (that powers the n8) but even if its not quite there yet, nokia will keep evolving and improving the touch screen parts of the os, and will become good enough, soon enough.
this is not the target market for new mobile phone subscriptions.
but the vast majority of nokia's business still today, is in 'dumbphones' ie the basic phones and the featurephones like say a cameraphone or a musicphone.
the system is very restrictive and limiting.
hard as in people are only recognised as consumers, and the key objective is to maximise arpu, by whatever means possible.
while that may not technically be true, it will be a far better story for the nokia pr people to spin, than the past year of explaining why the n8 was again delayed...
stored on the phone - all messages, pictures, phonebook etc.
this now is again worsened as we hear for example from europe that nokia was bullying carriers about commitments to sell lumia in q4 etc.
this now is again worsened as we hear for example from europe that nokia was bullying carriers about commitments to sell lumia in q4 etc.
as carlota perez argues in her booktechnological revolution and financial capital, when the economy is shaken by a powerful set of new opportunities with the emergence of the next technological revolution, society is still strongly wedded to the old paradigm and its institutional framework.
it is hard to avoid articles that talk about microsoft and nokia, that do not mention the promised nirvana of the 'third ecosystem'.
if there are 5.1 billion mobile phone subscribers on the planet - and the option is to be the best-selling phone for that part which is 285 million of those - or the remaining part which is 4.815 billion mobile phone users - nokia has focused correctly.
the windows phone os forces the standard buttons on the touch screen that crowd out part of the screen permanently and the other controls are pretty lame.
no credit cards etc needed).
in the usa, the television market is the biggest advertising market and the biggest mass medium.
remember, the old windows mobile was built to be business-oriented (as was symbian originally).
and the technology need not have a cellular connection, the more logical way of doing this is to coordinate with the home connectivity center (a home wifi connection center and/or femtocell for example).
the last vestige of nokia strongholds - its superb build quality - is now jeopardized and indeed, first evidence of problems already not just reported - but acknowledged by microsoft and nokia!
well, actually that number is implausible because of the lack of electricity.
i have not seen any recent nokia organizational charts, but probably there is room to cut some areas that drain managment resources but deliver little value to the bottom line.
by definition, all new born humans between 2010 and 2020 will still be pre-teens by the end of the decade.
the lumia is a failure and it will get worse.
you would have to be a colossal idiot to mess this launch up .
obviously the year has not been kind in the over-competitive smartphones bloodbath (google and microsoft very visibly quit the smartphone handset business already, but both are increasing their software and services focus on mobile, so they have not abandoned the opportunity in digital convergence).
you will fling a couple of birds angrily at some pigs and no doubt say 'apps'.
the basic phone is becoming a commodity product, and if we plot the price of basic phones with moore's law, by the end of this decade, a cheap cameraphone for africa will cost 1 dollar.
if we now assume all 6.8 billion people on the planet get a mobile wallet/mobile banking service that adds yet one more sim card, we do reach the 50 billion number.
at only 9.99 euros, the unrestricted pdf based ebook is formated for the smartphone screen so you can have the stats in your pocket every day.
i've told the story of modern forestry management, where trees are tagged with devices containing gps-gsm chips, for intelligent digital forest management.
except that where cow herds can be big, cows are herding animals, so all the farmer needs to do, is connect the lead cow, and the others will follow.
the music industry was slow to get into this opportunity and there were many problems along the way - witness crazy frog.
nokia unattributed executive said lumia sales were "getting good traction" and "we are pleased with the early results".
apple makes its iphones very similar to each other.
and google are not alone among internet giants believing in a mobile future.
the nokia strength has been exceptional qwerty keyboards.
the camera utility is limited and restricted.
the touch screen phone was not invented by apple, nokia had its first touch screen phone out years before the iphone.
they are not as good as (when considering the touch screen only) as the iphone is - but who is, honestly, this is comparing a ferrari to a toyota for goodness sake - but nokia's touch screen phones are getting better every generation.
in other words — the company isn’t fat in a traditional sense.
in india and much of africa the access to electricity is so rare, that people often send the spare batteries to nearby towns or villages to be recharged (while using the other spare battery to power the phone).
like they say in africa, mobile is not the 7th mass medium, its not the first mass medium; it is the only mass medium.
if lumia sales are below 4 million, lumia has failed to an unacceptable degree.
notice that after 'learning apple lessons' giants like google, microsoft and vodafone - have not been able to crack their way into this market.
the tiles are a gimmick but mostly are only an update of widgets that have existed on such 'burning platforms obsolete' operating systems as nokia's symbian.
so while yes, we can probably imagine 4 or 5 household gadgets today that could easily imagine being connected, and another couple likely to come - most obviously the home robot (south korea already has consumer-oriented household robot stores in major shopping malls).
and like i said, banking and credit cards are at far under one percent of total users (and far far less than that in total value of the transactions going through mobile).
this is all someting stephen elop was not in any way involved with, yet he stands to reep the rewards of the work that was done before him.
so now the new microsoft smartphone os has the worst branding baggage out of the whole microsoft empire.
nokia put it on its flagship first in 2006 on the n93.
that may be good for microsoft (which seems not to care in the least about suing everyone so it might even be seen as a drawback at redmond).
so some skills are changed.
if you walk into the store with the apps as your decision criterion, then windows phone fails from the start.
the lumia 900 and lumia 800 do look like flagship phones and have won plenty of praise, copying nokia's radical look of the n9 from last year.
some batteries draw down too fast, others don't recharge properly and sometimes the problem blocks the whole battery operation.
his arguments are very good, but they are somewhat usa focused and still do not tackle some of the biggest reasons why windows phone - and nokia lumia - will fail.
so today any symbian phone can do full microsoft office fully and all its peripherals and apps.
the shareholders have been satisfied, it is not another finn, and not someone from the inside, who might have been 'poisoned' with too much 'finnishness' or 'nokia-think' so the shareholders should now be happy for the short run.
elop could decide how and where to introduce the actual models to the public, how near or far from the commercial launch date.
i didn't talk about the reality of the device as it is manufactured, whether design flaws or component problems or build quality etc.
yeni barbie oyunları on engagement marketing japan style: snack brand tohato creates a multiplayer online wargame
if microsoft was the magic potion - surely nokia should have been able to capitalize on it in 2009 and 2010 before elop decided to set his platforms on fire like the psychotic arsonist.
these will get better over time.
but i said last february that the microsoft adventure for nokia was a high-risk gamble.
so don't delude yourself into thinking that lumia can somehow grow on the enterprise/corporate client side, either in the usa or the rest of the world.
for what its worth, my gut says they are way too optimistic, the evidence suggests it will be worse that this.
it has only passed 50,000 apps.
if we multiply the planet's population with 3 subscriptions we pass the 20 billion mark, and arrive at 20.4 billion.
i have used real consumer data mostly from 2011, to examine every major element that is decisive in smartphone purchases today.
but nokia was seen as a mostly gentle giant, and one that mostly did not do harm to the ecosystem.
kantar reported the same crash of nokia smartphone new sales in all european markets.
now this week we heard that there won't be any android smartphones on the vodafone brand.
its only loss of the past decade was one quarter during this economic crisis, when the nokiasiemens unit's losses were bigger than the profits made in the handsets unit.
the value of the different industries today headed for major cannibalization by mobile, where the majority of their business will end in mobile - is worth 5 trillion dollars.
so apps will not win the battle for lumia.
1.6 billion people live without electricity according to cnn in 2008, so if we take the average household size of 4 people per household globally, thats 400 million households without electricity.
nokia utterly dominates the new smartphone market too (and does it profitably).
without that money, moto would have lost money again in its phones business.
that will bode very well for nokia smartphones.
if we multiply the planet's population with 3 subscriptions we pass the 20 billion mark, and arrive at 20.4 billion.
the internet and digital enabled new ways for fans to discover their music and artists (myspace, youtube, social networking).
web browser is far lower, at 33% for europeans and 39% for americans.
there are many more industries, more small ones, that also are impacted by mobile, like cameras, music, videogaming, the watches and clocks industry etc, but those are so small (all under 100 billion dollars in size) that i won't spend much time on them now.
now it seems to be clear, it will be that the internet will converge onto the mobile.
this is not proof of an os that is ready for prime time.
the critical point is, that nokia can sell touch screen smartphones for a quarter of the price that apple can - while still doing it profitably.
so the handset portfolio problem is far bigger here in the low end of the smartphones for the emerging world markets.
there is a need to accept a lack of control, and of uncertainty, not only being prepared to accept being taken outside of one’s comfort zone but deliberately seeking it out – the consequence of which is a more disciplined mind or organisational culture, that is now capable of strong creative and conceptual thinking.
the second biggest country by population is india.
so the migration has started.
but we should assume growth, so lets double that number and we arrive at 8 billion connected personal stand-alone (non mobile phone based) digital gadgets.
nokia's touch screen interface will not need to be 'better' than the iphone - nor even 'as good as' the iphone, as long as nokia's touch screen interface is 'good enough'.
how long is it worthwhile to try to fight for that ultra-cheap market and what strategic moves if any, nokia may want to make in that space.
that is what lenovo wants now, as they launched their lephone and sold 100,000 units in the first quarter.
it also sells apps, services, and networking gear.
these guys manufacture the wireless telecoms infrastructure, ie the thousands of 'base stations' and various antenna gear etc that is needed to build a billion-dollar cellular network.
the article got a lot of attention and on first read, to the random reader, it seems to make good arguments (i will deal with those later).
but for some consumers - remember this is only the 7th most important priority - they have their 'check lists'.
if microsoft windows was such a magical synergy tool, why is the consumer-oriented iphone outselling the windows smartphones in the us enterprise/corporate space, after a decade of windows mobile / windows phone sales by microsoft and its partners.
app stores are less than meaningful (today).
whether its a netbook or ipad or kindle or a notebook, lets say the planet gets a laptop for every person - and by the end of the decade that will of course have a 3g or faster connection.
they are so poor they don't even own a radio receiver.
soon symbian will be 'just as good' as most in the multi-touch experiences.
here a successful 'west coast' manager from microsoft no doubt can help a lot in forcing much-needed changes to streamline nokia's design and development work.
nokia was perfectly poised to fight for this low-cost price segment with symbian, because symbian was designed to work on very modest technological requirements and often these ultra-low cost smartphones are not touch screen devices.
as i witnessed when i delivered my keynote to the mobile marketing association global event in the meccha of advertising, manhattan of the mad men of madison avenue haha, the big global ad agencies are all ramping up their competences in mobile, and i am witnessing it myself with far greater interest now in my mobile marketing workshops and seminars, such as delivering a keynote to the big mma event in sao paulo this week.
even as it is an element of genuine leadership, that is supported by essentially the whole industry as an obvious trend, elop goes against the trend.
it may become that one day, but it is not competitive yet.
executive summary i know this is a painfully long article for most to read.
lets work on the upside and say, on average there is a pet in one third of all households (my guess is that the number is smaller but no doubt someone among our readers will know it).
this is probably more like windows 2.0 (remember that, ouch ouch ouch) than windows 3.0 which finally was the first windows on the pc that was (barely) usable.
here a successful 'west coast' manager from microsoft no doubt can help a lot in forcing much-needed changes to streamline nokia's design and development work.
so this is by every measure the single biggest product launch in the history of mobile phones.
real player was standard on nokia phones still last year and most rivals support the file format.
even of companies that we think of as 'mobile' like nokia, vodafone, verizon and telefonica - they have sizeable fixed landline telecoms business.
i honestly do not know, but i would not be surprised, if there weren't many middle to senior managers who really should be moved on.
the music industry was slow to get into this opportunity and there were many problems along the way - witness crazy frog.
lets go to the usa, its home market.
again a shift that nokia initiated and is mastering today with few real rivals (samsung the strongest to try this tactic too, with its bada based smartphones that were only launched earlier this year).
the ceos of the major media giants from publicis to warner music to emi have all started to sing 'future of media is mobile' stories.
i can make some very general assumptions but honestly i have never met the man, cannot comment on his management style etc.
but is it truly more important, that the ui is 'unique' - something no buyer asked for - or whether the operating system itself if useful, or the app store has tons of apps, or the camera is easy to use; etc.
and where nokia previously did have near retina display pixel density on the e90 communicator, nokia has again regresssed and now both lumia 900 and lumia 800 fall far short of the retina display sharpness of even the year-old iphone 4.
no electricity, no clever digital household gadgets either.
if we now assume all 6.8 billion people on the planet get a mobile wallet/mobile banking service that adds yet one more sim card, we do reach the 50 billion number.
there are almost no subsidies, so you pay exact real retail price.
making nokia's branding worse.
the fourth most important factor is themodel of the smartphone handset of any given brand.
that conference had many pioneers of mobile ad space, presenting, as were some big advertising companies who had launched their mobile advertising units.
they came from nokia and microsoft offices.
thirdly, please allow me some more clumsiness and brevity and even more meandering in my writing style this time in this blog article, as i am back from vacation and heavily travelling and super-busy, so i wanted to get my thoughts out sooner, rather than try to find the time to refine and edit this blog down some more.
and its not just that, very big global partners have been cross-promoting the ovi store.
the value of the different industries today headed for major cannibalization by mobile, where the majority of their business will end in mobile - is worth 5 trillion dollars.
a huge support system was in the recording industry to produce the sound of the music, to produce the cds, to ship them to music retail stores, and to use the radio stations, music video tv stations like mtv, and promotional concert tours to help promote the album sales.
nobody will buy the lumia because its touch screen is superior.
nokia was once for its main business being rubber.
this desperation move is purely due to mismanagement and mistakes by elop.
and this shift is far more price-sensitive than the enterprise/corporate phones market, so super-premium prices 'superphones' like the iphone 4 or samsung galaxy or blackberry torch will be mostly out of reach to the true mass market consumer segment.
so you dig more and you find out, that this car wasn't painted by ferrari in its colors, it was painted by kia the cheap car maker of south korea.
or perhaps the customer has a collection of movies transferred to microsd memory cards, or whatever.
if anything, nokia was known as the brand that did sms texting just about as well as it could be done.
it comes to a crowded market with the samsung galaxy now the big dog of the yard, with the iphone 4 a very strong contender, and various other superphone wannabes, from motorola droids to blackberry torches to lenovo lephones out there.
do you believe that abandoning 33% market share - when your unit sales grew 47% and your revenues grew and your profits grew so explosively, for the last quarter nokia set a record in profit growth of its handset unit -and replacing that with 8% market share only 3 years later, with no growth but about flat sales, dramatically fallen revenues and at best miniscule profits (probably continued losses).
not just pruning unnecessary tech 'bloat' but literally going back in tech, to specs that were normal on nokia phones a year, two, even three years ago.
so i cannot tell you really anything 'deep' and 'insightful' about mr elop.
nokia's ceo stephen elop decided that one utter communciation disaster like ratner effect is not enough, he compounded it with an osborne effect.
remember that nokia's last succesful flagship - the n95 - handily outsold the iphone globally.
about apple - remember that this is 'mobile' not 'wireless' or 'portable' so the iphone is mobile, but other ios devices, while they are portable like ipad and ipod touch, they are not mobile devices, their services are not mobile, they do not 'ring in your pocket' haha.
note this growth was not that smaller 'newcomers' making smartphones had 'grown' into the global 500.
if the consumer wants to buy a stand-alone mp3 player, that will then have very particular music needs, and that person will definitely own a smartphone also, towards the second half of this decade.
and to see how widely dispersed this industry is, those top 25 companies are spread across 15 different countries.
and nokia does not do colossal mistakes.
microsoft will also be selling the ads irrespective of nokia's own brand.
the growth was even better than they expected.
else if you do touch screen, you are just another rival.
also this highlights how incredibly rare that success by apple was with the launch of the iphone and how exceptional - truly excellent - their entry was into the smartphones space.
that kind of revolution is typical apple.
but the guardian tech writer who bought a lumia 800 in the uk before christmas,was so fed up with it already after christmas when using it, he returned the smartphone - and wrote in one of britain's biggest newspapers that its what he did.
they do not read tech magazines with product reviews and contrasts and recommendations.
similar stats come from all around the world and obviously nokia's own reported smartphone unit sales tell the same morose tale.
without that money, moto would have lost money again in its phones business.
it was not manufactured in nokia's world's most efficient and competent handset manufacturing factories.
the original symbian os which powers nokia's smartphones was not designed for touch screen inputs.
this selling of a key nokia ecosystem component is how nokia's ceo communicates to his staff how his new management stops the competition from "taking our market share with an entire ecosystem."
the internet is going mobile too.
then nokia had to be far better than ranked 8th outside of the usa, after all the usa is by far the biggest economy on the planet.
note, this doesn't exist and no word has been given that it will be arriving to windows phone and/or lumia.
they have zero concept of what a farmer in nigeria needs or a lumberjack in brazil or a fisherman in the philippines.
one quarter, this after nokia absorbed siemens's loss-making networking unit and was fighting during the economic crisis, to turn it around).
the lumia series is a downgrade of nokia camera capability and will severely disappoint past nokia owners and not stand up to rivals today.
the most used aspect on our phones is not apps or web surfing.
and elop was hired - as then chairman of nokia jorma ollila said when introducing stephen elop -elop was hired to fix nokia problems in execution.
the shareholders have been satisfied, it is not another finn, and not someone from the inside, who might have been 'poisoned' with too much 'finnishness' or 'nokia-think' so the shareholders should now be happy for the short run.
it is sms text messaging.
first, lets be very clear, in the past decade we did grow 10-fold in mobile (vs only 3-fold growth in the internet for example).
most rival smartphones have qr code readers.
we can assume that the legacy businesses, that do not embrace the digital convergence, to survive as a premium professional services industry but eventually fail the mass market.
that guarantees that any current owners of nokia will find the lumia a severe disappointment.
nokia has the biggest patent portfolio of any handset maker in mobile and has invented the second most aspects to mobile behind only ntt docomo.
i do not have to go into the specifics of what all microsoft has been doing in the past to anger the carrier community, as it is widely acknowledged that microsoft's carrier relations were 'strained' or 'challenged'.
no aspect of it is genuine nokia.
to understand how enormous number we are looking at, its more than ten times bigger than the global computer industry including all pc hardware from desktops to laptops and netbooks and tablet pcs like the kindle and ipad
perception problem against this light, nokia is 'accused' of 'failing' because of three major faults.
the elop effect collapsed the nokia smartphone sales globally, not only in the affluent countries but also in the emerging world countries.
the tiles are a gimmick but mostly are only an update of widgets that have existed on such 'burning platforms obsolete' operating systems as nokia's symbian.
yet these companies were formed and built like the steel mills, on fordist principles.
apple does it thumbing its nose at industry standards and quarrels with major players like its long-standing feud with adobe flash.
the nokia brand damage is recent and perhaps reversable but microsoft's brand damage with windows mobile and windows phone has been sustained far longer and been far more comprehensive.
(check out where the leading forecasters now estimate lumia sales for q4.
it should be said, that the telecoms networking business has been a huge drain on most major telecoms vendors - motorola's networking unit went bankrupt, ericsson's was loss-making for many years, nortel of canada went bankrupt and lucent from the usa, also loss-making, was sold to alcatel of france.
at the end of last year we reached mid-point, where half of all internet users accessed the web at least part of the time using a mobile phone (which includes the simple wap type of mobile internet usage common in many parts of the emerging world markets).
in the usa, the television market is the biggest advertising market and the biggest mass medium.
that loss is solely due to elop's mismanagement of nokia last year.
the internet and digital enabled new ways for fans to discover their music and artists (myspace, youtube, social networking).
that was replaced with windows phone, at best the 8th 'best' ecosystem today, which still a year later has less than half the number of apps as nokia currently still has on ovi and symbian.
it did not end the need for 'real musicians' ie playing at symphony orchestras etc, but it helped popularize music creation, by the masses, for the masses.
the big phone makers like nokia, samsung, sonyericsson and lg are not in the business of creating professional cameras.
nokia phones are sold on more networks than any other phone brand and nokia has special partnership relationships with many carriers, ranging from the world's largest carrier/operator china mobile to the world's most advanced and demanding carrier/operator ntt docomo of japan (the carrier who launched the world's first cellular telecoms mobile business ie the company that started this industry).
enter stephen elop, from microsoft, to take the reigns as nokia's new ceo.
that would give the car 2 subscriptions (for a short duration) but then upon our person we'd go down from 3 subscriptions to 2, as one was temporarily assigned to the car.
this while the industry reports massive jump in q4 sales by rivals like samsung and apple.
so the handset portfolio problem is far bigger here in the low end of the smartphones for the emerging world markets.
considering how heavily smartphones can be used on some days this is a huge disadvantage, especially for power users who surf the web, use wifi, shoot video, play music, watch youtube videos etc etc etc.
water, electricity and gas metering.
this is our biggest number and we do need to pump it as much as possible to get us to the 50 billion.
so you buy yourself a lumia and then set it up to wake you for the next day to go to work - and will have a severe 'i hate nokia' moment when your phone rings silently without waking you up.
this means lumia is worse off than nokia was before the elop effect.
microsoft ended up selling over a billion copies of windows and for long times they had over 80% market share in the pc market, but pcs are not that widely spread across the planet, so microsoft never approacted 25% of the planet's population.
so by faulty leap of logic, many see that nokia is somehow 'losing to iphone' (or android or blackberry).
if you like your cameraphone, you are better off buying a 1 year old n8 than any of the brand new lumia phones.
nokia introduced this fantastic feature on the n900 in 2009 (note, yes, read thumb drives and other usb memory devices including portable hard drives making the smartphone behave just like a real laptop).
and like i said, banking and credit cards are at far under one percent of total users (and far far less than that in total value of the transactions going through mobile).
notice that after 'learning apple lessons' giants like google, microsoft and vodafone - have not been able to crack their way into this market.
the forbes article starts off saying windows phone has a totally unique user interface.
it is well along, and the latest iteration of the symbian os is said to be far better at the touch screen parts.
portable multimedia players including dvd players sell 130 million.
that was replaced with windows phone, at best the 8th 'best' ecosystem today, which still a year later has less than half the number of apps as nokia currently still has on ovi and symbian.
for the second most important factor for smartphone buyers, the brand - both brands are so poisonous, this is the classic comment, two turkeys do not an eagle make.
nothing about it is a nokia, except that the ceo has the nerve to stick a nokia badge on the phone and claim it is a genuine nokia.
the lumia 800 doesn't support real media player files (that will play well with web services haha).
and what has been a major feature of nokia smartphones always - a high proportion of them have had physical qwerty keyboards in several formats such as the folder (ie communciator format) and slider and blackberry style wide candybar.
nokia profits have been declining - as one might expect in a global economic downturn where many 'gold standard' corporations of impeccable credit ratings went bankrupt.
so the 50 billion number has to include lots of devices per person, as well as a lot of non-human connections, whether devices, household gadgets, cars, etc; as well as other living beings like pets, farmyard animals and even connecting other things like plants.
without handset subsidies, a 100 dollar smartphone).
and best of all, nokia is poised to launch a new phone that the early reviews suggest could be a huge hit - any of its success over the next 12 months will befall the new ceo.
before this action, nokia could control how advertising might appear on nokia branded smartphones.
as this is a 'partly true' issue, the new ceo needs to tackle it on two sides - address the actual profitability rigorously, but also communicate it far more clearly - that nokia as a mass market consumer phone maker - should be compared to samsung, lg, sonyericsson and motorola (and zte) - and compared to any of those, nokia profits are very good.
deutsche bank counted in 2009 that the total global market for enterprise/business smartphones was 96 million handsets.
but i don't see someone coming to the store, and buying the lousy phone with the unique interface rather than the good phone with the familiar interface.
it once made personal computers (primarily for the domestic finnish market, nokia's micromikko was an ibm-compatible pc running microsoft operating systems).
but nokia's sub 200 dollar 'basic' smartphones play perfectly there.
so this blog is about those industries that can expect far more than half of their total value, possibly the whole industry, to migrate to mobile in the coming years and decades.
this is not the target market for new mobile phone subscriptions.
and in any case, if a customer wanting a nokia branded phone, is not walking out of the store with a nokia branded phone, that is a lost customer to nokia (and gain to apple or android).
the only thing genuine ferrari is the badge, which they bolted onto this fake ferrari, and even that was not put on in italy.
and you can't ride the dead horse the only thing you can do, is get off the horse and find some other way to proceed.
and obviously my view already now as we await the nokia q4 numbers for lumia is, that based on his behavior in the past year, elop has mismanaged his company so totally, that he may not be allowed to continue running nokia.
nokia has started on that dumb path already earlier under elop with the n8 being the first nokia smartphone that didn't let users replace the battery.
fifth biggest population is brazil.
that is nothing new, once there was a huge need of typing skills at major offices, typing pools, before the word processor and email made most of their typing work redundant.
motorola told us earlier this summer that a third of all smartphone buyers will not consider a smartphone that doesn't have a qwerty input.
i mentioned that ntt docomo created d2c together with the japanese advertising giant dentsu.
mobile credit cards are nearly as old.
what is best, is that the strategy and business basics at nokia are supremely sound.
what our research shows us that whether executed digitally or in our analogue world or indeed blended together - those organisations that have addressed these issues with conviction are the ones that have moved being stuck in a world of concussive ambiguity.
again, nokia abandons what is its competitive advantage in a futile attemp to match the iphone.
so ofcom is consistent with comscore that sms and the camera come ahead of web and apps.
tomi also has a facebook and linked in page under his own name.
for what its worth, my gut says they are way too optimistic, the evidence suggests it will be worse that this.
the ceos of the major media giants from publicis to warner music to emi have all started to sing 'future of media is mobile' stories.
levi's jeans, coca cola drinks, sony walkmans, bic pens, hoover vacuum cleaners, there is no brand ever, that had one quarter of the planet - but nokia is almost at that incredible point, currently used by 23.5% of the planet's population (and climbing)
whether its a netbook or ipad or kindle or a notebook, lets say the planet gets a laptop for every person - and by the end of the decade that will of course have a 3g or faster connection.
it may become so in the future, but its not yet nearly competitive with advanced os platforms out there.
biggest app store in china?ovi.
i based them not on my personal desires and preferences of what i like in my phones, i based it on the facts and stats of what real consumers do and want.
yet in south africa it is normal to get your paycheck paid directly to your mobile account.
so nokia lumia trades the best carrier relationships to bad ones, and then partners with the company with the worst relationships - that has been making them only worse last year.
nokia sells more s40 based featurephones, which use the proprietary s40 operating system (not part of symbian) but which could be described as 'smartphone lite' - just like symbian, s40 does allow full internet use, allows application downloads and the use of the nokia (ex ovi) store for content, apps and services.
that kind of revolution is typical apple.
but again, if we need a car to get us from point a to point b, until they invent teleportation, we will keep needing that car (or some rival like a bicycle or bus etc).
lets see how strong the windows brand is in smartphones.
disruption never asks for permission nokia said it would never release a touch screen phone, so someone else did - a software company.
digital editing of sound has enabled errors in sound quality to be 'fixed' - ie some boy bands and girl bands may have members who don't have good singing voices (perhaps are better dancers or just pretty on stage ) that can be increasingly 'fixed' electronically.
they have remained silent (in shock).
but one of the preferred solutions is what for example was deployed in south korea, where on the phone you have one sim card for your telecoms needs, and a banking-specific sim card for all your money needs including banking, payments, credit cards, loyalty cards etc.
with these matters utterly in his control the ceo can easily deliver that.
vodafone had earlier launched some cheap featurephones for emerging world markets like india.
nokia has its own gaming engine with graphics accelerators and all.
nokia had been the market share leader, with the best loyalty in the nation, and then produced ever better phones including one of britain's best smartphones of the year - and its rivals did nothing spectacular - remembering the iphone 4 had already been released by summer 2010 and the 4s was delayed till autumn 2011.
they came from nokia and microsoft offices.
this is due to the voices of fear, cynicism and prejudice.
and yes, a fraction of nokia's total phone output is smartphones, and this year the revenues out of smartphones roughly speaking match the total revenues of the dumbphones.
but as the mass market vanished, the mass market business also shifted.
that loss is solely due to elop's mismanagement of nokia last year.
so the sales reps learn real fast which phones have high return rates - and stop selling them!
note, the car may have multiple subscriptions, as we may for example use our normal phone service, take out the sim card from the phone and insert it into the car's sim card slot.
nokia had been the market share leader, with the best loyalty in the nation, and then produced ever better phones including one of britain's best smartphones of the year - and its rivals did nothing spectacular - remembering the iphone 4 had already been released by summer 2010 and the 4s was delayed till autumn 2011.
that is not the same in television or personal computers or cars or airplanes etc - most other industries the role of the us market is very big.
the big screen on the lumia 900 is nice, but far bigger screens are on current androids including the monster screen on the samsung galaxy note.
elop had a company that had growing sales, growing revenues, growing profits, and a growing share price - and turned that to losing sales, losing revenues, generating losses and a massively crashing share price (nokia's share price fell to less than half in the next five months).
if we assume one car-related subscription that comes with the new car when we buy it, to connect to the maps and security systems and self-diagnostics and on-board games etc - we only add 1 billion mobile subscriptions to the planet.
(again, us readers, don't be fooled about t-mobile contract price of 50 dollars for lumia 710, it costs many times more without the subsidy).
and for apple-watchers, not only has 'apple iphone' jumped up massively on the list, apple only making smartphones is almost as big as nokia with smartphones, dumbphones and the mobile side of nokia's networking business, combined.
etc etc etc we still have a need for real music and real musicians and real creative arists.
the market leader now has 16mp (htc).
he is a canadian - a nationality that seems to gell particularly well with finns (maybe its all that ice hockey - the greatest ever ice hockey player, the one they called 'the greatest' ie wayne gretzky, a canadian, did after all get most of his points scored, by setting up passes to a finn - jari kurri his long-time scorer-sniper, who in turn is of course the greatest-ever finn to play ice hockey.
lets start with the human 3 sim card target.
the advice and guidance of peers and friends is seeked even more than we might do.
its flagship phone is not seen as good enough to go against the iphone.
the rivals did not come in 2011 with superphones with unbelievable features like say time travel or teleportation.
and yes, i do believe in dramatic growth to come in mobile, so i am all for the expectations to be big.
nokia and microsoft had done full office suite integration years ago and it helped nokia and microsoft sell
the lumia is a failure and it will get worse.
i counted that in 2006 there were 7 of the fortune global 500 biggest companies on the plant, who made a smartphone.
in 2013 the projection has 16 million symbian sales for a total of 80 million nokia smartphones.
ok, lets take the uae example (this is abu dhabi, dubai etc the oil-rich emirates on the arabian peninsula).
in other words — the company isn’t fat in a traditional sense.
i called it the ahonen index and as far as i've seen, nobody else has published a similar list - quite astonishing considering that mobile is the fastest-growing giant industry, ever.
there is no need for plastic cards in south korea, but you may travel to a less advanced country like say germany or usa or australia or france where they 'still use plastic credit cards' haha...
so what happened to nokia sales in britain in 12 months.
of the total population on the planet, out of any person who has ever used any type of camera, for 9 out of 10 such users, the only type of camera they have ever used, is on some cameraphone.
this desperation move is purely due to mismanagement and mistakes by elop.
if you believe in growth opportunities coming from those sectors of the industry that expanding most strongly, mobile advertising is that right now.
what travel agent could have specialized in hong kong to sao paulo travel for me today.
but windows phone was built to be the iphone-killer - so admit microsoft execs now - and it was made to be a consumer-oriented smartphone os, not a business-oriented os.
and that kind of provocative argument does suggest those considering the market opportunity to also focus on who and what is to be connected, to understand we will run out of humans to connect, very soon, and the growth will need to be made from other devices and gadgets and pets and so forth.
all consumer reviews by the tech press say that the lumia 800 fails head-to-head against the iphone 4s or samsung galaxy etc, and the lumia 900 doesn't bring anything better on its look and feel.
from that it is a very 'safe' projection - actually quite negative of this alliance, if separately they are worth 32% but combined they only do 20% or 22% or something like that.
the third biggest factor for smartphone buyers in the emerging world, far ahead of apps or the os, is the network provider ie the carrier ie mobile operator.
nokia was very good also at keeping to its vision - not for example taking the populist view from 2006 that flip phones would take over the world (anyone remember the razr).
the finnish employment culture - and that at nokia - rewards loyalty and makes it difficult to lay off people.
artists would compile 'albums' of about 15 songs, sold at a price far greater than the one hit that currently made the artist popular on the charts.
mobile phones sell 1.3 billion units annually - in any one year they sell more mobile phones than the total installed base of personal computers on the planet.
there even have been exotic qwerty form factors like the butterfly keyboard.
the actual peak of the iphone market share has already happened (the iphone had 17% of smartphone market share this time last year, they are now down to either 14% or 13% depending on which analyst numbers you look - every analyst now acknowledges that the iphone has peaked and is losing market share globally).
meanwhile microsoft's windows phone was designed to work on very high spec components - in fact, windows phone does not even work on nokia's standard chip supplier equipment like texas instruments.
nokia was not years behind, nokia was literally years ahead of all its rivals in this space.
at&t will sell the lumia 900 as an exclusive.
if we want to measure the 'migration rate' then currently one third of one percent of all banking accounts have migrated to mobile.
even as it is an element of genuine leadership, that is supported by essentially the whole industry as an obvious trend, elop goes against the trend.
this happened while the global smartphone industry exploded in 2011 growing by 59% from the year before.
whatever you think of nokia's success in the past, whether you applaud it or are aghast, the performance of lumia will be worse.
all is not peachy so far its been a love-fest here with the communities dominate blog admiring nokia..
the customer knows far more accurately what is true value.
now the lumia 800 and 710 are far too expensive for this market.
what nokia would have desperately needed out of early lumia was low-cost smartphones now, to try to hold onto that market share.
and that, if we take the dozen industries mentioned in this blog (excluding travel, cars, hotels etc) is worth a cool 5 trillion dollars or about 9% of the total global economic spending of all economies on the planet.
elop in his microsoft madness decided not to use nokia's finland based competence, he went to the usa to design his lumia phones.
and then just make sure as ceo, that those profits will now turn into growth again, as the economy improves - and probably with some strategic decisions about focus areas.
i do like visions of big growth numbers in mobile.
and nokia's basic handset (dumbphones) unit is also profitable, and while its networking unit had struggled for a few years after nokia bought the loss-making networking unit from former giant rival siemens, nokia networking management very efficiently turned that loss-making business around, and now the combined entity is profitable - albeit only marginally so.
for example the phone will not wake up from the alarm.
he gave10 reasons why windows phone will fail.
windows phone does do multitasking, but only just.
steve jobs himself explained why the ecosystem would be stronger with an ad platform explaining that"developers have to find a way to make some money" and that the iad platform was a way apple could help its developers in its ecosystem.
over 70% of smartphones in india over 80% over the whole continent of africa in new smartphone sales in 2010 were nokia branded.
we actually have another issue with the homes too.
the internet is going mobile too.
anssi vanjoki even if asleep, even if simultaneously having nightmares, could still outperform the 6.4 million under those conditions.
no straight lines presents a new logic and inspiring plea for a more human centric world that argues we now have the possibility to truly transform our world, to be more resilient, to be more relevant to us both personally and collectively, socially cohesive, sustainable, economically vibrant and humane, through the tools, capabilities, language and processes at our fingertips.
but nokia's 'real' designers know.
but not to tag all trees, only those scheduled for the next round of cuts in the forest.
the enterprise/business market is very stable over time, it will not be significantly over 100 million today, so enterprise smartphones account for roughy speaking 1 out of every 5 smartphones sold globally.
similarly pocketable stand-alone gaming devices sell 48 million units.
i also discuss the enterprise/corporate side of the smartphone business.
the first xenon ie real flash in 2007.
i ended up moving the calcuation point to the q2 results (previous four quarters) so this is now roughly in harmony with the fortune global 500 issue which is published annually in the summer.
that market seems a great opportunity due to microsoft windows os and office suite integration with nokia smartphones.
nokia ceo stephen elop was on stage a couple of times as was microsoft ceo steve ballmer.
i am not saying all was well, but nokia had passed the worst part, and was on the road to better.
in reality that is a market anomaly that applies to north america only, where only 8% of the planet's mobile phones are sold..  nokia utterly dominates the rest of the world (with the exception of those countries where strong domestic rivals control that country, south korea, japan and yes, the usa).
the lumia 800 has only 8 mp camera regressed from 12 mp in n8 a year before.
but it also often means cannibalization of the legacy services and their eco-systems.
to understand how enormous number we are looking at, its more than ten times bigger than the global computer industry including all pc hardware from desktops to laptops and netbooks and tablet pcs like the kindle and ipad... plus the applications and software industry enabled by the pc industry.
understand that even in 2013, symbian will utterly tower over windows phone in installed base.
yes, from small things, big things can grow.
while the big banking execs are mostly blissfully ignorant, thinking that launching an iphone app is tantamount to a mobile strategy, haha, the tsunami wave is well under way.
we can't fly on the phone.
and the buyer has worked far more for that dollar than we have had to for our dollar.
and managements at very big global corporations do make investment decisions and product commitment decisions based on some very serious calculations.
even of companies that we think of as 'mobile' like nokia, vodafone, verizon and telefonica - they have sizeable fixed landline telecoms business.
i am not saying nokia had somehow magically caught up with the iphone butthe fact is, nokia had a record christmas quarter in 2010, and then things were improving for 2011.
the pure smarpthone maker htc sits just out of the chart and is likely to enter it next year.
in the usa, sms used by 67%, camera used by 57% and internet surfing by 43% (they did not ask about apps).
the company like many was once super successful - so successful in fact that it seemed nothing could stop it.
that is why even when nokia had problems like the failed flagship smartphone n97, nokia overall global sales did not suffer severely.
lumia 800 doesn't have tv out, that came to nokia flagships in the n93 in 2006 and many rivals have it.
and best of all, nokia is poised to launch a new phone that the early reviews suggest could be a huge hit - any of its success over the next 12 months will befall the new ceo.
if lumia fails to sell 4 million copies in q4, it will be so comprehensively rejected that nokia cannot revive it.
yes, some geek like you and me may know of it, but even for us, its very very low in the order of what we want.
because of it, nokia now is in deep trouble and has to try to sell assets just to remain alive.
reason 2 - camera catastrophy so lets go to nokia's second huge advantage against all competitors outside of japan and south korea domestic markets.
no wonder that one of the us carriers refused to offer the glaring color options.
what is worse, the next update to windows phone is aimed at the cheapest phones, so the flagships cannot even catch up to the rivals with the next windows phone release.
by offering a wide range of smartphone models.
i have been preaching the convergence story in each of my 9 books and was personally involved in the early stages of the digital convergence, from creating the world's first computer company advertisement to the internet (media and internet convergence) to leading the team that created the world's first fixed-mobile converged solution (fixed and mobile telecoms convergence) to authoring early documents on the future of convergence (at nokia's telephony gateways digital convergence unit, i authored the first white paper for the industry to discuss how to do the internet on mobile).
this has been reported only in anecdotal evidence and mostly in countries of the industrialized world, but nokia itself admitted in the quarterly results that its carriers and distribution channel had reduced inventory suddenly and to an unanticipatedly large degree.
it comes to a crowded market with the samsung galaxy now the big dog of the yard, with the iphone 4 a very strong contender, and various other superphone wannabes, from motorola droids to blackberry torches to lenovo lephones out there.
some of the fantasies and science fiction views are dramatic yes, but the numbers do not add up.
we now apparently have the evil empire and its evil twin.
this time there is huge pent-up demand for nokia phones and almost no rival nokia handsets to steal any lumia sales.
and what has been a major feature of nokia smartphones always - a high proportion of them have had physical qwerty keyboards in several formats such as the folder (ie communciator format) and slider and blackberry style wide candybar.
because of that, nokia can't even start to ship low-cost smartphones until the second half of this year at the earliest (if microsoft manages to deliver on time).
the lumia 800 has only 8 mp camera regressed from 12 mp in n8 a year before.
in europe pew found in every country the same order, sms most, camera second and web third.
in smartphones nokia's market share fell from 29% in q4 of 2010, to 12% of q4 of 2011.
so the cannibalization will eat into the size of the 'total pie' of the industries prior to convergence.
so yes, the automobile industry is eager to get into mobile too, many new cars feature sim card slots for example and the next internet (after the internet has gone mobile) will be in cars.
but why none of its strategies worked was because the company took too long and sat on its duff watching digital photography come and eat it for a mid-day snack even though kodak r&d helped with the digital photo revolution when it launched the first digital camera in 1975.
nokia ceo stephen elop was on stage a couple of times as was microsoft ceo steve ballmer.
this against the reported evidence that the iphone is breaking all of its sales record and on every national chart for which i have seen statistics, the iphone 4s sits as the bestselling phone for q4.
but that likely digital convergence will not kill most industries.
and the major media industries and advertising are headed to a pocket near you too.
if elop practised what he preached, he would not be selling his mobile advertising unit, he would be nurturing it, growing it - not selling it.
the lumia series was not designed by nokia top engineers in finland.
nokia's brand has been damaged very badly in the past year.
we can assume that the legacy businesses, that do not embrace the digital convergence, to survive as a premium professional services industry but eventually fail the mass market.
the tomiahonen almanac is the indispensible industry statistics volume for anyone working in this industry.
even the superphones are featured in the stores even as few customers ever can afford them.
in terms of a viable 'mobile phone age' population, what is the total population of 6.8 billion people today, can be seen to be the viable mobile phone aged population a decade from now.
when you look at the lumia 900, it is like the designer of the lumia 800 fell asleep.
artists could still sell tickets at concerts, so they shifted more of their income from selling albums to concerts.
the lumia 800 doesn't support video calling (gosh, how far back can i go, i think it was the 6680 back about 2004 that first had videocalling support and every nokia flagship has had it since..
the mac was always better.
we know the latest iteration of nokia's app store as ovi - incidentially the world's third best-selling app store for those who care about the lives of ants in the world of elephants.
the replacable battery is far more necessary.
the touch screen phone was not invented by apple, nokia had its first touch screen phone out years before the iphone.
and in many of the less affluent countries on that list, even radio does not reach as widely as mobile phones.
yes it was thebiggest management failure in the economic history of humankind, that we witnessed last year.
then the comparison - sms text messaging alone is worth 100 billion dollars.
but apple did what it always does, it made existing things far better - so we see a new world (in touch screen interfaces) after the iphone - and now also in tablet pcs too (kindle, ipad etc).
a nokia cameraphone so good a professional movie maker made not an 'experimental film' for a film festival, or a short film, or amateur film, but a full commercial production movie for cinematic release.
the nokia share price was not falling in february - the stock market liked elop's first five months of nokia leadership so much, that the share price had climbed 11% - a very strong growth in a five month period for the new ceo, when the previous three years had seen a 50% drop in nokia share price.
i did a meticulous calculation of the futility of investing in apps today, and showed with rigorous analysis and facts that half of developers of paid apps will not make a profit in less than 11 years, and for the free apps (ie used in advertising and marketing)
the cameraphone did not kill the stand-alone camera.
i am sure there are plenty of uses for near field connections for all sorts of sensors to enable something like digital farming, to identify animals, but those don't need cellular network connectivity.
nokia adjusted, and it now has not just one touch screen phone like apple, nokia has of coursee a series of touch screen phones.
and nokia owned the low-cost smartphone space.
if that feeling turned to hostility, there is good chance it can be reversed.
the sensible smartphone designed for emerging world markets as a low-cost smartphone will have dual sim slots, will have family ringing and family phonebooks (allowing the sharing of one phone with several family members) and will include the torch/flashlight etc where the village has no street lights at night etc.
there is no slot for any kind of memory card which is regressing from the microsd slot in the n8 that supported 32 gb memory cards.
so in sum about nokia today, it is the biggest, most dominant dumbphone maker.
elop himself admitted the damage to nokia market share took him by surprise and admitted later to more surprise that nokia plunged from generating profits to generating losses.
there is no need for plastic cards in south korea, but you may travel to a less advanced country like say germany or usa or australia or france where they 'still use plastic credit cards' haha...
i am not saying all was well, but nokia had passed the worst part, and was on the road to better.
the joke was, that to see what will be on the next iphone model, just look at a 3 year old nokia flagship.
if we say 6 connected gadgets in the home, we'd arrive at 10.2 billion more to add to our total.
there were stand-alone pdas yes, but no advanced 'smartphone' to give computer like performance.
it is hard to avoid articles that talk about microsoft and nokia, that do not mention the promised nirvana of the 'third ecosystem'.
if the lumia sales in q4 fall under 4 million, the signs are undeniable that lumia's path is a dead end, a cul-de-sac, and the sooner nokia board sees this, the sooner they must terminate all activites that waste resources pursuing that route.
one quarter, this after nokia absorbed siemens's loss-making networking unit and was fighting during the economic crisis, to turn it around).
if you like your cameraphone, you are better off buying a 1 year old n8 than any of the brand new lumia phones.
morgan stanley found 2% of the phones sold to be premium smartphones; 11% to be other smartphones and the remaining 87% to be 'featurephones' ie non-smartphones or 'dumbphones'.
nokia has started on that dumb path already earlier under elop with the n8 being the first nokia smartphone that didn't let users replace the battery.
whatever you thought of ovi and symbian 'failing' in apps, it is far worse on windows phone.
rather than sell ad unit, why not allow sales of n9 what i cannot understand, is if nokia is in the business of selling mobile phones, and its most profitable smartphones are currently onthe undersirable lumia brand (where sales representatives at stores find that in 11 cases out of 12, a customer who buys a nokia branded smarthpone refuses to take a lumia) and thehighly desirable meego platform (where sales representatives find that one in four customers who buys a nokia smartphone, will buy an n9 which uses the meego operating system)
so while nokia had every chance to gain an advantage on the look side, it voluntarily abandoned about half of the total market potential.
nokia is again voluntarily abandoning a competitive advantage, which means lumia will perform less well than nokia was able to do in the past.
the planet did not suddenly have a huge rise in its wealth in the past two years (arguably, we've suffered globally with the economic crash).
in the usa, sms used by 67%, camera used by 57% and internet surfing by 43% (they did not ask about apps).
whatever you thought of microsoft success or failure in the past in mobile, the ex general manager of windows phone tells us that microsoft had indeed had a bad relationship with carriers, microsoft's attitude to carriers had already been one of arrogance and abuse; and that carriers hated it;and that since then microsoft had been making matters worse - and the resulting penalty from carriers was to push sales away form microsoft to android.
yes, we have the clever plants-to-humans communications by agrihouse of japan who offer the humidity sensors to plants that send sms messages to the owner saying when the plants need to be watered.
lumia 800 (and 900) is utterly beyond the market price except for the rich elites, who will rather buy iphones, blackberries etc.
after that all games need to be repurposed to the windows phone format - thats no small feat - and the handsets need the gaming accelerators etc for the hardware, etc.
apple is suing everybody and winning.
the critical point is, that nokia can sell touch screen smartphones for a quarter of the price that apple can - while still doing it profitably.
taking a book from donald rumsfeld they are trying to convince investors that lumias will be greeted as liberators.
the windows phone os forces the standard buttons on the touch screen that crowd out part of the screen permanently and the other controls are pretty lame.
motorola went from profitable to loss-making in its strategic partnership with microsoft smartphones.
we can't fly on the phone.
n/a source: tomiahonen almanac 2012, the above table and data may be freely quoted notes: * indicates imaginary company, based only on mobile revenues, with imaginary name for the company ** indicates actual real ranking in fortune global 500 listing as it is a real company purely in mobile note also that the google company incorporates motorola mobility unit revenues, but not other motorola mobile revenues of its networking etc business.
he said because carriers have explicitly decided to support android rather than windows phone - "that is why windows phone has not sold as well".
this is corporate suicide.
most of that was not consumer-oriented app store applications.
again, that does not end the need for pure excellence in real singing - witness uk singing sensation susan boyle what the digital convergence did, most of all, it dis-intermediated some players, and re-intermediated others.
stand-alone digital cameras sell 103 million per year (says morgan stanley in 2009).
when the battle for the pocket started a decade ago, the total value of all pocketable digital gadgets was about 100 billion dollars in very rough terms.
the sales reps hate returns - because the customer has to be sold another model smartphone - but the sales rep won't get a new commission.

if they had aggressively pursued the mobile market, either through a premium cameraphone or a specialist role in the ecosystem or in partnership - any of the big giants of cameras could have a major role in the mobile industry today.
nokia is a complex organization with much design and r&d overlap - quite costly.
amplifying reason 4 - brand is muddled you understand that if nokia was a rubbish brand in the usa, but still ranked 8th most powerful brand globally in 2010.
remember, these customers do not have an internet to go do price-shopping.
i can understand that the ceo of a company that is massively generating losses (no matter what the cause) is now resorting to desperate moves such as firing tens of thousands of employees and selling assets.
nokia adjusted, and it now has not just one touch screen phone like apple, nokia has of coursee a series of touch screen phones.
so maybe we can find salvage from the microsoft side of this partnership.
they were involved in the first mobile battle of convergence, what i called the 'battle for the pocket' in my second book m-profits in 2002.
in q2 of 2009 windows smartphones in the usa had 9.7% market share according to gartner.
nokia shipped sub-100 dollar smartphones from 2009 as did samsung.
paid downloads and paid customers to mobile phones, not smartphones, globally, years before angry birds. 4 million is nothing amazing to the mobile industry.
nokia is a complex organization with much design and r&d overlap - quite costly.
a new converged economic opportunity emerges within the digital convergence which will not be as big, as the separate industries would be separately.
nokia brand is sheer garbage today.
mobile alone is worth a bit more than one fifth of that, so there is far more from 'outsiders' to 'contribute' to this journey, than for the legacy mobile giants to do
so lets see how technologically advanced the lumia 800 is, the flagship currently available - the lumia 900 will release only on at&t late in the spring about the time when we expect the iphone 5 to launch.
same with the n9 (pure touch screen) and its sister the n950 (with qwerty slider).
in this nokia case, the gambler arrived with a million dollars and only has 100,000 to show for it.
the first generation of iphones would not even let users install apps to it!
but you do love the look and feel of the ferrari and its bright red ferrari color, until you drive next to another red ferrari, and obseve that your red is not the same red.
it adds your keys to your home and car, the pass-keys to your office, your identity card, and now as the phone collects your payment behavior, they have launched the mobile consierge to the phone, to help manage your life.
i don't need 1 million sim cards, i need 1,000.
nobody will buy the lumia because its touch screen is superior.
against its real rivals today, nokia is a powerhouse utterly dominating its industry, the true gorilla of the mobile world.
nokia is offering ever cheaper 'africa phones' and keeps providing features and abilites that many rivals ignore, specific to the less wealthy customers - replacable batteries, critical in countries of poor electricity supply - in-built fm radios - surprisingly for many in the poorest countries the first ever fm radio they have owned, is the one that comes with the new nokia phone.
the smartphone apps portfolio is ranked only tied for 5th/6th highest priority for buyers of new smartphones.
in britain lumia didnt make it into the top 10 bestselling smarpthones even for the december month.
so while we in the industrialized world can at least theoretically have a good impression about microsoft and windows, and it can 'help' in the branding battles - top priority please remember, then in the emerging world countries the microsoft brand is no help and easily a hindrance.
there is management overhead.
of the portable digital gadgets, with the 8 billion number.
then - while the customer would be willing to prioritize the brand of phone (nokia) ahead of the exact model - in these cases, there is no other nokia smartphone to sell (because idiot elop decided to pull all symbian phones from the shelves in the usa, and worse - refuses to sell the magnificent n9 and n950 which run on the meego operating system).
nokia's flagship phones have always, always had the best cameraphones (japan, s korea blah-blah-blah).
then - while the customer would be willing to prioritize the brand of phone (nokia) ahead of the exact model - in these cases, there is no other nokia smartphone to sell (because idiot elop decided to pull all symbian phones from the shelves in the usa, and worse - refuses to sell the magnificent n9 and n950 which run on the meego operating system).
its very very bloody in the smartphone wars.
i ended up moving the calcuation point to the q2 results (previous four quarters) so this is now roughly in harmony with the fortune global 500 issue which is published annually in the summer.
i am sure there are plenty of uses for near field connections for all sorts of sensors to enable something like digital farming, to identify animals, but those don't need cellular network connectivity.
but even worse, is that microsoft never used to have good carrier relationships.
apple revived itself in the pocket electronics market, by re-inventing the pocket music player market with the ipod and revived the whole company, with ipod mania helping sell more macintosh pcs and boosting apple's margins.
some of the fantasies and science fiction views are dramatic yes, but the numbers do not add up.
but the application developers' interest in making apps is totally dependent on their belief that its worth their while.
yet elop is doing everything he can to sink that nokia-controlled first ecosystem and replace it with what microsoft tries to call the 'third ecosystem'
the sad fact is, that on qwerty the keyboard on the e7 is truly magnificent.
elop had carte blanche to overspend on the launch marketing activities as much as he wanted, and obviously no other ceo in any other situation would have approved as extravagant marketing budgets for just any year's 'regular' flagship model launch.
apple is a classic premium luxury niche maker, who can hope to have 3% of the market - like it has with the macintosh pc, after 26 years of fighting those battles with its 'revolutionary' pc.
apple revived itself in the pocket electronics market, by re-inventing the pocket music player market with the ipod and revived the whole company, with ipod mania helping sell more macintosh pcs and boosting apple's margins.
the big phone makers like nokia, samsung, sonyericsson and lg are not in the business of creating professional cameras.
what our research shows us that whether executed digitally or in our analogue world or indeed blended together - those organisations that have addressed these issues with conviction are the ones that have moved being stuck in a world of concussive ambiguity.
if it is indeed true, you should be able to find experts saying so.
if stephen elop can deliver at least the 4 million lumia sales that nokia n8 and symbian s^3 did last year - without adding the industry growth, i would conclude that elop is spectacularly incompetent or irresponsible or foolish or rash, but perhaps the board can be forgiven to allow some more time for elop to try to make his strategy work.
if we want to measure the 'migration rate' then currently one third of one percent of all banking accounts have migrated to mobile.
this is similar to what apple did to the pc industry in 1984 when it released the macintosh, and all 'ibm compatible' pc makers had to adapt, where the primary change was the shift to windows, microsoft's version of attempting to copy what the macintosh offered.
but i said last february that the microsoft adventure for nokia was a high-risk gamble.
you lost customers trying to shift them from dumbphones to smartphones.
and rather than it costing say 200,000 dollars, i charge you 150,000 dollars for the brand new ferrari.
yes the usa, known for such fantastic global hit phones as the palm, the danger, the hp, the compaq, the motorola - anyone remember the rokr - and yes, microsoft's own magnificent kin, the phone so disasterous, it was terminated 6 weeks after launch.
yes it was thebiggest management failure in the economic history of humankind, that we witnessed last year.
that changed last year when the advertising industry woke up seriously to mobile.
i have more important things to do, this blog is not a financial analysis blog.
the market shares of those other 'big 5 handset makers' in smartphones was almost every quarter worse, than their share in dumphones.
the whole camera and video experience was always superior on nokia.
this is a very hard thing to do and few do it well -lego being an example of the few .
no credit cards etc needed).
the lumia series was not designed by nokia top engineers in finland.
that means that the world would match roughly what is normal in europe today.
the lumia is the first time ever, that nokia has regressed in its features, severely.
it says a lot about nokia that symbian survived this transition where palm died and microsoft found the transition so difficult it killed off the windows mobile platform to launch a totally new one, called phone 7 - while its market share crashed from near 20% to 2% in just four years.
the total global mobile phone app market last year was worth 5 billion dollars (said chetan sharma consulting).
but the first five months at nokia, when elop was in charge, saw the nokiasmartphone unit sales grow strongly,nokia smartphone sales revenues grow dramatically, andnokia profits at the smartphone unit jump at a nokia record level.
if you always wanted a ferrari but couldn't afford it, perhaps you bought yourself a toyota mr 2 sportscar or a ford mustang.
morgan stanley forecasts that in 2012 nokia will sell 40 million symbian based smarphones so the total for 2012 for nokia is 77 million.
that is the right strategy for nokia (while it would not necessarily be the optimal strategy for a specialist niche maker like apple or rim).
and blackberry obviously owns a lions's share of that market.
he looks at global trends where the whole industry is in agreement - like now with mobile advertising.
there are lots of opportunities, but also lots of endless pits of wasted effort in mobile, where the profits will never come.
the windows phone os can seem exciting when first seen with its 'tiles' but on short usage it reveals how limited and unfinished it is.
so very many of the stories we discuss here, will invariably touch upon nokia, or feature nokia.
yes, it should do better in the us market, and stephen elop gets a fresh chance to turn nokia around in the usa, but the shareholders need to be told much more about how enormous the market is globally, compared to the pretty trivial-sized us market in phones.
this trend was captured by the iphone but not invented by apple.
so that was the 'old' microsoft mobile.
so that was consumers.
what do customers want in their next phone we have seen what consumers do with their smartphones.
the current windows phone edition does not support low-cost smarphones.
the employees did this with aliases, but were revealed from the website addresses they used.
the screen size is 3.7 inches, which is regressed from 4 inches on the e90 communicator four years ago.
there were stand-alone pdas yes, but no advanced 'smartphone' to give computer like performance.
in countries like pakistan and bangladesh the electrical grid is shut off several times.. per day .. to conserve energy.
the lumia doesn't have fm radio, nokia added it gosh, years ago, about 2005.
nokia gave ever better phones with better features (e7, x7, n9) and the symbian os released ever better editions and the nokia ovi store became the second-bestselling app store and everything was improving at nokia.
kantar reported the same crash of nokia smartphone new sales in all european markets.
canalys statistics tell us that in china in 2010 in q2 the market share for nokia (obviously running symbian) was.. get this.. 77% !!!
sure, like madonna said to wayne and garth, and monkeys might fly out of my butt.
the lumia series is a downgrade of nokia camera capability and will severely disappoint past nokia owners and not stand up to rivals today.
nokia already sells basic non-touch screen smartphones at 100 dollars (price without subsidy, ie without contract, where the iphone without contract costs 600 dollars) and is pushing the price point of cheapest touch screen smartphones to that level too - already offering its cheapest touch screen smartphone at nearly 100 euros.
so apps will not win the battle for lumia.
for us in the industrialized world countries, it is no hardship to pay 600 dollars for a premium smartphone like the iphone or samsung galaxy or blackberry bold or sony xperia or nokia lumia 800.
kindel said carriers are reluctant.
the burning platforms memo is 1 year old.
in my journey in writing no straight lines, i have seen this organisational myopia as a constant red thread.
minolta and konica have quit the camera business altogether.
but the migration of money is very slow.
i think the 3 mobile subscriptions per person concept is not really viable for the whole global population.
google, microsoft and now vodafone have decided that the phones race is too costly to join (or to remain in).
so only one new sim card per car.
lg made losses with its phones business.
he said that nokia had"lacked accountability and leadership" and that nokia "had not delivered innovation fast enough".
so they claim no fragmentation.
there was the famous dog who ate the nokia phone.
it is abandoned with the first 3 lumia phones.
so by december 2013, the world will have about 111 million windows phone smartphones in use.
most of the work mr elop will be doing is stuff we'd never even bother to write about on this blog.
again i am not a lumberjack but to me the clever way to use this technology is for some forest 'manager' to go tagging trees that need to be felled, with the intelligent gsm-gps devices.
the competition is so tight that competitors are dropping like flies.
yes, about half of south koreans and the japanese have mobile digital money enabled phones and services, but its nowhere near yet where half of their economy would transit the phone, and they are the most advanced digitally converged nations.
in africa, literally, for about half of the population, the first radio they ever personally owned, is the one that comes on the nokia phone.
zune might - might - duplicate the modest success of nokia music in the best case.
the look and feel will be above average definitely but not on par with the top phones by the rivals.
so far up to now, the converged opportunity has always ended up far bigger than the initial industries that got into it.
by nations of the top 25, 5 of the biggest companies come from the usa, 3 from china, 3 from japan, 2 from south korea, and 2 from france.
publicis ceo maurice levy said that within a few years "most of the music", "most of the information" and "most of the advertising" will "transit through your cell phone.
the windows phone os can seem exciting when first seen with its 'tiles' but on short usage it reveals how limited and unfinished it is.
there are literally thousands of news stories parroting that 20% number and the third ecosystem baloney.
compare to motorola which after the razr launched the rokr and today motorola is no more, as the bankrupted and split-up handset maker it was bought by google.
these are all industries whose size is above 200 billion dollars annually - ie each is bigger than the total global handset business including smartphones and dumbphones and all phone based accessories like spare batteries and phone covers and memory cards etc (combined, is worth about 160 billion dollars in total - a small fraction of the 1.1 trillion dollar mobile telecoms industry where the majority of the revenues come from mobile services like voice, sms and premium mobile data services).
this is totally different input paradigm from the touch screen, and its amazing for nokia to have been competitive in both (touch and qwerty) at the same time.
so just to compare apples to apples, the new operating system launch led by the new flagship phone, lumia 800, would need to sell 6.4 million copies in the past q4, only to match what nokia did a year ago.
if we assume that to happen for the whole planet, that would get us to 13.6 billion.
nokia and microsoft had done full office suite integration years ago and it helped nokia and microsoft sell
the top 7 companies in mobile are carriers/operators.
then yes, the lumia 900 and lumia 800 are good-looking smartphones,but not as good as the iphone 4s while being in the same price range.
this must be lumia's big market and tomi is a total fool to not see it.
against its real rivals today, nokia is a powerhouse utterly dominating its industry, the true gorilla of the mobile world.
and readers, this is again one of those ultra-long tomi ahonen essays, about 16,000 words (more than a full chapter in a hardcover book) so go get yourself a good cup of coffee before you start.
that made the smartphone space one of the most competitive of any industries on the planet, with probably more global giant rivals than any other industry ever in the same space.
elop discovers a significant nokia advantage in its ecosystem.
the mac was always better.
nokia smartphones used to come with a huge array of pre-loaded apps and the devices were overloaded with technological goodies.
... plus the applications and software industry enabled by the pc industry.
same is true of the various other cameras-oriented industries like kodak and polaroid.

we thought that each household would have 6 connected gadgets.
it actually came from india, from the tata motors factory (the company that makes the cheapest car in the world).
yes, symbian too has lost market share, but very little.
so this blog is about those industries that can expect far more than half of their total value, possibly the whole industry, to migrate to mobile in the coming years and decades.
symbian is plagued with fragmentation (although it was getting less so) and android is seeing more and more of it.
also this highlights how incredibly rare that success by apple was with the launch of the iphone and how exceptional - truly excellent - their entry was into the smartphones space.
the system is very restrictive and limiting.
nokia will never generate as huge profit margins as apple, but if nokia's profits turn now from decline into growth - then stephen elop will be seen as the savior, the miracle-maker, the man who defeated the apple iphone challenge and saved nokia.
so i cannot tell you really anything 'deep' and 'insightful' about mr elop.
it would be an interesting market analysis to count all gaming-oriented smartphones (like the iphone, most downloaded apps are games after all, the iphone can be said to be the first globally successful gaming phone platform to rival the nintendo and playstation portable..) and their value into the videogaming software value, the proportion would be bigger still.
first, remember that only 1 in 5 smartphones sold worldwide is a business/enterprise smartphone.
beyond monster quarter selling 37m units of iphones to 25% market share kodak analogy is not nokia, it is motorola; nokia analogy is not kodak, its ibm the no straight lines challenge: be realistic imagine the impossible google search the www recent comments baron95 on the truth.
that diminished - but did not eliminate - the role of the traditional music studio for creating music.
for us in the industrialized world countries, it is no hardship to pay 600 dollars for a premium smartphone like the iphone or samsung galaxy or blackberry bold or sony xperia or nokia lumia 800.
massive profits in this fast-moving and dynamic industry.
but all experts who have reviewed windows phone have immediately pointed out that they are not even up to modern standards yet, far less being in any way 'leading edge' technology.
nokia was once for its main business being rubber.
watch every telco try and make sense of a word built on sharing, networking, participatory cultures, "we the media", and its like watching someone dance with two left feet.
the first xenon ie real flash in 2007.
but it will see more returns than its peers.
the problem here is that we only have 1.7 billion households on the planet.
kantar gives nokia's market share in the summer of 2011 as .. 11%.
the big screen on the lumia 900 is nice, but far bigger screens are on current androids including the monster screen on the samsung galaxy note.
when i joined nokia in the 1990s, the networking side was the bigger side with most of the staff and most of the revenues.
they came in ranked.. fifth.
nokia does not give us a breakdown of the s40 sales, but nokia recently celebrated the 1.5 billionth s40 cumulative shipment number.
this bodes very well for nokia and lumia as these customers are coming in to replace their smartphones now in 2012.
without handset subsidies, a 100 dollar smartphone).
if the customer wants a specific model, and that is not sold by that carrier,the facts tell us that the smartphone customer would be willing to buy another lumia or even another nokia smartphone - except that because of management madness, there are no others.
as we learned from universal mccann the advertising giant, one in seven media minutes is spent with mobile already today, as mobile is often the digital response channel for legacy media like television, radio, print etc.
" in reality, as it relates to mobile advertising (just like in mobile payments, location and mapping, app stores, videogames, music etc) nokiacaught the big trend, were indeed making the right decisions, and with the benefit of incredibly accurate foresight, once again, found itself years ahead.
this would not have happened if the phone and its software was designed by adults.
the brand new nokia lumia 900 won best product of the show.
certainly google, apple, microsoft, ntt docomo, vodafone etc see this and invest heavily in it.
i have given you evidence and facts and stats and end-user surveys, showing what smartphone users do, and what smartphone users want, and what other factors influence the purchase decision ie the carrier relationshiops the corporate purchase departments.
where ios and admob and others face strong competition in advertising from legacy mass media like tv, newspapers, radio etc; and obviously internet advertising - nokia's symbian platform is thedominant smartphone platform in all countries where legacy media is not established as a true 'mass' medium reaching even half of the population and where mobile access to the internet exceeds pc based access to the internet.
levi's jeans, coca cola drinks, sony walkmans, bic pens, hoover vacuum cleaners, there is no brand ever, that had one quarter of the planet - but nokia is almost at that incredible point, currently used by 23.5% of the planet's population (and climbing)
in 2010 nokia grew smartphone sales by 47% from the year before.
the reason nokia is now conducting a fire sale of its best assets is only due to incompetent management by its ceo, causing self-induced damage to nokia, its products, its carrier relations, its customers and its brand.
mobile alone is worth a bit more than one fifth of that, so there is far more from 'outsiders' to 'contribute' to this journey, than for the legacy mobile giants to do
nowhere near as great as the iphone but nowhere near as expensive, and being of nokia quality and brand and sales channel - it will dominate the market.
this sale of nokia's pioneering mobile ad unit is how the ceo rewards those parts of nokia that did indeed"deliver innovation fast enough".
they only sell 2% of the world's total mobile phone handset market today, but its such a huge market, that it powers the majority of apple's revenues and the majority of apple's profits.
if we say 6 connected gadgets in the home, we'd arrive at 10.2 billion more to add to our total.
as we learned from universal mccann the advertising giant, one in seven media minutes is spent with mobile already today, as mobile is often the digital response channel for legacy media like television, radio, print etc.
voting for american idol, that kind of experiences.
what is worse, the next update to windows phone is aimed at the cheapest phones, so the flagships cannot even catch up to the rivals with the next windows phone release.
no! note, this is a nokia competitive advantage.
telecoms, broadcast and print media, advertising, computers, the internet, banking, credit cards.
i am also including a fortune global 500 rank equivalent for those which would have qualified for the fortune global 500 based solely on their mobile business and what ranking they would have had.
so the sales reps learn real fast which phones have high return rates - and stop selling them!
i don't have a good measure for wristwatches and alarm clocks.
elop himself admitted the damage to nokia market share took him by surprise and admitted later to more surprise that nokia plunged from generating profits to generating losses.
thats only 50,000 trees to fell per year.
nokia has a vast library of videogames already formated for the small screen.
the current windows phone edition does not support low-cost smarphones.
motorola reported a surprise profit in its handset division, but that was a one-time gain out of a lawsuit settlement with rim.
the one sim cards is compatible with all south korean banks and credit cards etc, so its just a question of a given bank or provider enabling their account onto your banking sim card.
nokia had very accurately foreseen the future markets as they emerged, and provided suitable, low-cost smartphones for those markets and utterly dominated the emerging world.
so i can talk about nokia's strategy and corporate health, in this age of the 'ultimate contest in convergence' for the 5 trillion dollar prize, as i blogged last week.
the lumia 800 doesn't support hdmi out which came to nokia on the e7, and now some top rivals do it too.
the top 3 are not just from different countries, but based on different continents.
kodak has been in restructuring mode for 15 years – cutting headcount, closing factories, tightening belts and squeezing rocks for blood.
that market seems a great opportunity due to microsoft windows os and office suite integration with nokia smartphones.
android is 8 times bigger, apple iphone app store is literally 10 times bigger.
the statistics of smartphone sales reflect that too.
its like toyota making a supercar that matches a ferrari..
telecoms, broadcast and print media, advertising, computers, the internet, banking, credit cards.
and you are not quite familiar with all ferrari models, so you then talk with your friend and then you go to the internet to see the actual details about this particular ferrari model.
mobile data is worth 250 billion dollars.
but also, that there were some good reasons as well, and that i could well see why the shareholders felt that was needed.
and you cannot transfer apps and various content via bluetooth etc.
when you take a bookstore and put it online like amazon, yes you can have some 'distribution' and 'warehousing' benefits and you can sell a larger catalog of book titles than the bricks-and-mortar bookstore down the street.
their very first strategic partner and launch customer for microsoft's first smartphones, uk based sendo was driven to bankruptcy after lengthy court cases with the evil empire.
coming from microsoft's unit looking at the future of the pc side, cloud computing etc - will give particular insights into what kind of synergies may be useful in the near future - in evaluating the value of nsn to nokia as a strategic asset, or whether they try to get rid of it now while it is marginally profitable.
a paper based traditional travel agent would never ever have that capacity, except perhaps for the few 'domestic' airlines that serve their home town.
nokia had a massive competitive advantage that it simply refused to exploit.
when the battle for the pocket started a decade ago, the total value of all pocketable digital gadgets was about 100 billion dollars in very rough terms.
as carlota perez argues in her booktechnological revolution and financial capital, when the economy is shaken by a powerful set of new opportunities with the emergence of the next technological revolution, society is still strongly wedded to the old paradigm and its institutional framework.
nokia shipped sub-100 dollar smartphones from 2009 as did samsung.
we just lost 2.4 billion connections and a further 800 million metering connections.
the reality is that in the past 12 months, nokia smartphones have been winning against the iphone, not losing to it.
nokia can do the broadest product portfolio.
in the global brand survey of 2010 by interbrand, nokia finished 8th best brand ahead of such icons as rolls royce, rolex, mercedes benz, porsche etc.
the other big us carriers are not selling any lumia handsets this spring.
he warned that nokia's competitors "are taking our market share with an entire ecosystem."
this is the desperation move by the small rival who tries by a few cosmetic tricks to expand its product line.
the actual peak of the iphone market share has already happened (the iphone had 17% of smartphone market share this time last year, they are now down to either 14% or 13% depending on which analyst numbers you look - every analyst now acknowledges that the iphone has peaked and is losing market share globally).
so please understand, nokia's smartphone strategy is the best in the business, and any shift to android for example would be stupid, abandoning a huge market lead and total control of its future, to the whims of google's 'do no evil' strategies.. most of all any business is about profits.
he has sold various nokia assets from several sets of nokia's prime patents, to a whole handset factory in romania.
the global picture tells the same story.
by deciding not to make what is a competitive advantage at nokia.
and nokia is also a network equipment maker.
if stephen elop can deliver at least the 4 million lumia sales that nokia n8 and symbian s^3 did last year - without adding the industry growth, i would conclude that elop is spectacularly incompetent or irresponsible or foolish or rash, but perhaps the board can be forgiven to allow some more time for elop to try to make his strategy work.
if the market is big, and there is money to be made, then application developers will cope with the fragmentation.
some of us of a certain age have piles of kodak slides and snaps, even old kodak cameras around the place.
but all experts who have reviewed windows phone have immediately pointed out that they are not even up to modern standards yet, far less being in any way 'leading edge' technology.
so, last year with only normal launch, with a tight schedule which could not be changed (the n8 and s^3 were delayed to an embarrassing degree), with only modest marketing budget (nokia had just recovered from a quarterly loss) the n8 and symbian s^3 sold 4 million copies.
the poorer people didn't suddenly all - billions of them - receive massive pay rises.
elop discovers a significant nokia advantage in its ecosystem.
its quite feasible for samsung or htc to spam nokia branded smartphones via the windows phone ad platform.
i counted on this blog that if we add both the traditional pcs including desktops and portable computers, and the smartphones, we get atotal market size of 465 million units for 2009.
minolta and konica have quit the camera business altogether.
nowhere near as great as the iphone but nowhere near as expensive, and being of nokia quality and brand and sales channel - it will dominate the market.
amplifying reason 4 - brand is muddled you understand that if nokia was a rubbish brand in the usa, but still ranked 8th most powerful brand globally in 2010.
nokia had failed in the us market, so the nokia brand cannot help microsoft in the us market, that would need to be the other way around.
while the replacement cycle for non-phone portable gadgets is longer than the replacement cycle for phones, certainly a significant fraction of the total cumulative sales of that number were replacement units, of better capability, sold to the same consumer.
the lumia 800 doesn't support real media player files (that will play well with web services haha).
when you take a bookstore and put it online like amazon, yes you can have some 'distribution' and 'warehousing' benefits and you can sell a larger catalog of book titles than the bricks-and-mortar bookstore down the street.
like the customer who has had a previous nokia and loved that its fm transmitter lets you connect to your car without an ipod cable connector.
and the technology need not have a cellular connection, the more logical way of doing this is to coordinate with the home connectivity center (a home wifi connection center and/or femtocell for example).
what if you find out that your 'genuine' ferrari was not actually manufactured in a ferrari factory in maranello italy.
if we assume that to happen for the whole planet, that would get us to 13.6 billion.
a few of the 7-8-9 year olds perhaps, but thats not enough to push us far above current 6.8 billion level, in particular that for those few of the eldest in this group, we then have to balance out those elderly people who will be dying in this decade.
the lumia series is the first time ever that nokia not only was not the best cameraphone, but it actually regressed.
obviously the year has not been kind in the over-competitive smartphones bloodbath (google and microsoft very visibly quit the smartphone handset business already, but both are increasing their software and services
nokia has its own gaming engine with graphics accelerators and all.
motorola went from profitable to loss-making in its strategic partnership with microsoft smartphones.
microsoft feels it worthwhile to continue building its mobile advertising unit even as its reach across both windows mobile and windows phone smartphones, currently, is less than 30 million.
its a nice number yes, but what is the record-breaking achievement in the tiny sandbox called iphone, is trivial to the big world of mobile.
we just heard from morgan stanley that they project nokia and microsoft to sell 37 million lumia phones this year 2012 and 64 million lumia smartphones next year 2013.
yes, it should do better in the us market, and stephen elop gets a fresh chance to turn nokia around in the usa, but the shareholders need to be told much more about how enormous the market is globally, compared to the pretty trivial-sized us market in phones.
now nokia branded smartphones, when using the microsoft windows phone os, will be subject to microsoft advertising concepts and spyware.
but that gets us only 8.2 billion subscriptions.
reason 5 - fails also on windows brand microsoft is a strong brand.
nokia put it on its flagship first in 2006 on the n93.
so in february of 2010 i went through the trouble of calculating out the pure mobile revenues of all the biggest players in mobile andpublished the world's first global listing of the 25 largest companies, when ranked only by their mobile revenues.
the lumia is the first time ever, that nokia has regressed in its features, severely.
what does convergence enable remember that converence gives us new opportunities of better experiences and as an industry, vast new opportunities.
i had already given my view of apple's strategy in smartphones which i wrote during my summer vacation.
but windows phone was built to be the iphone-killer - so admit microsoft execs now - and it was made to be a consumer-oriented smartphone os, not a business-oriented os.
etc etc etc we still have a need for real music and real musicians and real creative arists.
and drool at the amazing opportunity that nokia business-oriented e-series smartphones can have with full microsoft office integration.
for anyone who actually owns an iphone will not play long with the lumia in the store, before knowing the iphone is a far better buy (if you already are an iphone owner).
he could decide their specifications, their intended target markets and end-users.
so the second most important thing customers ask for, which was a strong nokia asset, has been ruined not by manufacturing errors or market forces, by nokia's ceo with his idiotic communications last february.
they are very aware who is who and who plays naughty and who plays nice.
the global ad industry top management may be late to the mobile party, but they are dead serious about it now.
in 2010 nokia grew smartphone sales by 47% from the year before.
so please understand, nokia's smartphone strategy is the best in the business, and any shift to android for example would be stupid, abandoning a huge market lead and total control of its future, to the whims of google's 'do no evil' strategies.. most of all any business is about profits.
i can understand that the ceo of a company that is massively generating losses (no matter what the cause) is now resorting to desperate moves such as firing tens of thousands of employees and selling assets.
the african farmer who earns 2 dollars per day, can neither afford to buy the iphone at 600 dollars without contract, nor to sign up for a 2 year contract of 50 dollars per month to get a 'free' iphone on handset subsidy).
these will be tiny niche industries, but can be profitable and sell to very passionate specialist customers, and those who specialize within the remaining industry but manage to capture the premium end of that market, can make a nice living in it.
the tomiahonen almanac is the indispensible industry statistics volume for anyone working in this industry.
the lumia 710 is yes, cheaper than the 800 but its still far too expensive to become any kind of mass market success (its price without subsidy is about 350 - 400 dollars).
i have written time and again, that nokia was struggling in 2009 to 2010, and fired its ceo kallasvuo, replacing him with elop.
motorola told us earlier this summer that a third of all smartphone buyers will not consider a smartphone that doesn't have a qwerty input.
but yes, apps and the mobile web had switched places (they did not ask about the camera).
nokia voluntarily foregoes a competitive advantage that it has always before taken advantage of.
i made the joke speaking in toronto this week, that finland has just appointed its first-ever canadian vice prime minster - arguably the ceo of nokia is perhaps the second most powerful man in the domestic finnish economy
lets say 2 utilities meters per household, and we add another 3.4 billion connections and arrive at 43.0 billion.
these will be tiny niche industries, but can be profitable and sell to very passionate specialist customers, and those who specialize within the remaining industry but manage to capture the premium end of that market, can make a nice living in it.
nokia's ceo stephen elop decided that one utter communciation disaster like ratner effect is not enough, he compounded it with an osborne effect.
his arguments are very good, but they are somewhat usa focused and still do not tackle some of the biggest reasons why windows phone - and nokia lumia - will fail.
so lets see how technologically advanced the lumia 800 is, the flagship currently available - the lumia 900 will release only on at&t late in the spring about the time when we expect the iphone 5 to launch.
thats a bit what the job of ceo of nokia is today.
that was the norm for dumbphone makers.
vacations are good for fresh thinking.
nokia has the biggest patent portfolio of any handset maker in mobile and has invented the second most aspects to mobile behind only ntt docomo.
and that customer most likely went online somewhere to see what model they want.
the brand new nokia lumia 900 won best product of the show.
i do not have to go into the specifics of what all microsoft has been doing in the past to anger the carrier community, as it is widely acknowledged that microsoft's carrier relations were 'strained' or 'challenged'.
the victims of natural and man-made disasters will not be accumulating multiple it devices.. 50 billion is not plausible
and nokia is also a network equipment maker.
google, microsoft and now vodafone have decided that the phones race is too costly to join (or to remain in).
while mass market consumers are usually blissfully ignorant of the backstabbing in the corporate world of partnerships, the carriers/operators are not.
and that customer most likely went online somewhere to see what model they want.
by offering a wide range of smartphone models.
the lumia series is the first time ever that nokia not only was not the best cameraphone,
nokia offers both of course as makes sense in this market.
there are almost no subsidies, so you pay exact real retail price.
he ruined nokia's brand.
so for example the tns global survey of 34,000 mobile phone owners worldwide on their purchase priorities with mobile phones, the rankings are different.
not only has microsoft been sleeping with everybody, but microsoft then awards its 'strategic partners' with a sexually transmitted incurable disease as a parting gift.
if one of its three lumia models is aimed to be an iphone 'killer' then make the other two as different and all three quite distinct from each other.
even at the height of 'beetle mania' meaning the iconic volkswagen original beetle, there was not a vw for every fourth person on the planet.
he damages the nokia version (or in this case sells it).this destroys a nokia native advantage 'in a war of ecosystems' and instead brings nokia ever more to the full control of microsoft, as its slave.
while the big banking execs are mostly blissfully ignorant, thinking that launching an iphone app is tantamount to a mobile strategy, haha, the tsunami wave is well under way.
nokia was not only the best phone brand essentially in every country outside of the usa, canada (and south korea and japan); but it was literally the most valued brand: period.
it meant that previous global giants of other industries had decided to enter the mobile space, like computer makers such as apple and dell, like internet giants like google and yahoo, like mobile operators/carriers like vodafone and hutchison, and softwre maker giant microsoft etc.
kantar gives nokia's market share in the summer of 2011 as .. 11%.
i don't know if other smartphones support this function yet but obviously nokia has brought it to newer phones like the e7.
its not as good as apple did in 2007 but lenovo is at least taking a stab at this market, rather than how the cameramakers hid their heads in the sand and tried to avoid the truth.
