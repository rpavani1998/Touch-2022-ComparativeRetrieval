to do that requires a step change in learning and self-improvement – this is achieved through continuous contemplation and self-reflection which ultimately enables the mastery of an aware self/organisation, with the motivation to pursue truly motivated goals.they had the wisdom to recognise the old model of commerce was broken they had the courage to explore new and emergent means by which to create a new sustainable business they listened deeply and evolved an internal ability to critically appraise where they needed to get to they recognised the important patterns in co-creation and how they could have real benefits for r&d, organisational capability, commercial models and marketingthese will be tiny niche industries, but can be profitable and sell to very passionate specialist customers, and those who specialize within the remaining industry but manage to capture the premium end of that market, can make a nice living in it.there is a need to accept a lack of control, and of uncertainty, not only being prepared to accept being taken outside of one’s comfort zone but deliberately seeking it out – the consequence of which is a more disciplined mind or organisational culture, that is now capable of strong creative and conceptual thinking.we get vastly superior services for consumers when we seek opportunties out of digital services.nokia has easily the production capacity and the world's largest phone sales network and distribution system including the ability to air ship a million phones a day, every day, anywhere it needs to.by every single criterion, nokia lumia is underperforming the market - and on most it is regressing from where nokia was before lumia.nokia profits have been declining - as one might expect in a global economic downturn where many 'gold standard' corporations of impeccable credit ratings went bankrupt.they only sell 2% of the world's total mobile phone handset market today, but its such a huge market, that it powers the majority of apple's revenues and the majority of apple's profits.digital editing of sound has enabled errors in sound quality to be 'fixed' - ie some boy bands and girl bands may have members who don't have good singing voices (perhaps are better dancers or just pretty on stage ) that can be increasingly 'fixed' electronically.in india and much of africa the access to electricity is so rare, that people often send the spare batteries to nearby towns or villages to be recharged (while using the other spare battery to power the phone).the lumia series is a downgrade of nokia camera capability and will severely disappoint past nokia owners and not stand up to rivals today.and nokia's basic handset (dumbphones) unit is also profitable, and while its networking unit had struggled for a few years after nokia bought the loss-making networking unit from former giant rival siemens, nokia networking management very efficiently turned that loss-making business around, and now the combined entity is profitable - albeit only marginally so.and in no straight lines - we point to and demonstrate that there are excellent models for organisations today which would enable them to [1] transition [2] then transform into something that looks more appropriate and relevant for the world we live in today.it should be said, that the telecoms networking business has been a huge drain on most major telecoms vendors - motorola's networking unit went bankrupt, ericsson's was loss-making for many years, nortel of canada went bankrupt and lucent from the usa, also loss-making, was sold to alcatel of france.
