recently, however, that situation has changed and now mac users also need to be on the lookout for viruses (such as autostart worms), trojan horse programs (which hide bad things in a seemingly innocent package—hence their name), and other nasty stuff that can wreak all kinds of havoc on your mac.a practical benefit of virtual memory is that it gives your mac enough room to open up multiple applications.the benefit of this arrangement is that any and all programs that run on your mac and need access to the features offered by the extension can get to them by interacting with the operating system, as they normally do.recently, however, that situation has changed and now mac users also need to be on the lookout for viruses (such as autostart worms), trojan horse programs (which hide bad things in a seemingly innocent packagehence their name), and other nasty stuff that can wreak all kinds of havoc on your mac.finally, the last drawback of this arrangement is that if you’re using applications that can’t or don’t take advantage of the features offered by certain extensions, you’re wasting precious mac memory.new application updates, operating system patches, and other types of upgrades are often the key to solving frustrating problems or just some annoying glitches.like pcs, macs take advantage of something known as virtual memory, which basically uses some space on your mac's hard drive to "fake" the system into thinking it has more real physical ram than it actually does.this can be very handy if you're working with large or complex documents because if the application doesn't have enough room to do its work, you may get an error message saying there isn't enough memory even if you have lots of ram installed and it's the only program running.new computer viruses are being developed and unleashed at an alarming rate and even if you have the most recent version of an anti-virus program, you may still be at risk if the virus definitionswhich is what looks for and erases specific virusesarent current.the macintosh, on the other hand, is generally much less prone to problems and those problems that do arise tend to have more straightforward answers.finally, the last drawback of this arrangement is that if youre using applications that cant or dont take advantage of the features offered by certain extensions, youre wasting precious mac memory.to fix that problem and/or avoid getting any viruses in the future, make sure you purchase and install an anti-virus program such asnorton antivirus or virex and, most importantly, keep the virus definitions up to date.new computer viruses are being developed and unleashed at an alarming rate and even if you have the most recent version of an anti-virus program, you may still be at risk if the virus definitions—which is what looks for and erases specific viruses—aren’t current.as you might expect, finding extension conflicts can be very slow and tedious (aren’t computers grand!), but conflict catcher makes it a bit easier by automating the testing and restarting process to a certain degree.as the above example shows, extensions can take up a lot of memory and turning off a bunch of them (or even sometimes just a few of them) may give you several megabytes of ram space back.
