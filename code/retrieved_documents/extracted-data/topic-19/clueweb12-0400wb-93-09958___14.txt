additionally, if a part on your pc breaks outside of warranty you can browse  many shops and manufacturers and pick the cheapest part with the best quality.
mac is much better for 2d and 3d art.

when i think of pc vs mac it's not just windows vs osx; it can encompass a lot of other things too.
i know that with vms and emulation the mac is way better on this than it used to be, but we all know the mac is never going to be a gaming computer.
so i'm not really in any position to judge,

so i'm not really in any position to judge, but i get the impression that more software is designed to run on a pc than on a mac pretty much, as far as i'm aware.

another problem is that when something is  wrong you have no choice but to return it to the apple shop you bought it at  and then wait until they get it back from the workshop.
i can use like vb.net, c# and rpg maker 2k3 macs are also good because they're faster then pcs, way fewer viruses out on the web for them, and i found it easier to use ps cs4 on it.
i left linux off the list because it can run on both pc and mac.
