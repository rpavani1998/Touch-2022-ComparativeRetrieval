the fcp system ran fine on a high end emac, which is a consumer model.
which  is better for filmmaking, pc or mac?
having used both discreet and premiere on pcs, and final cut pro on a mac,  i would say, software speaking, final cut is slightly better than discreet (and  both products are light years beyond premiere in my opinion)

however, when it comes to hardware, i would have to say that the mac also has the advantage.

as well, the powerpc architecture has far more advanced fpu's than x86.
in day to dy use, this is not substuantial enough to cause mass  panic between the two, but having used both, in my opinion, the mac is slightly  the superior.

the discreet system though powerful, costs quite a bit on the side  of hardware, and running on windows nt (can't comment on xp) had a fair number  of crashes.
