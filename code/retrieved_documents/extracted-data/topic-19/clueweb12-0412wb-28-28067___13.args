i actually like the fact that they are giving ms a little competition.
we need to hear more from apple, obviously, but it's hard to imagine, in the midst of their "green-up" why apple would switch to bodies that are impossible to open for repairs.
it is rotting in the garage as we speak.
with apple you usually can't build your own or even can't upgrade your equipment then run mac os.
i have heard reports that the zune is better anyway.
if you don't own gadgets like this you do not have to get them fixed, recycled, maintained.
but your home made pc, although still running, will be equally worthless - unless you are talking about the box having a load of upgraded parts in it
never have i damaged the au case, maybe the ant cover, but thats a cheap part.
her other sister's ipod: utterly stopped working.
the damage is cosmetic, but significantly decreases resale value, and be unacceptable to people seeking repairs.
i also have a toshiba satellite laptop with from 2006.
i have been through 5 different types of pc's in the last three years ranging from gateways to sonys, and they all result in the same thing... useless computers that need to be restarted every time i open up word, or want to print a file online.
far from the free spirit image they project.
it does not mean you are stupid for buying their products, just that apples ad execs are doing their job.

of course build-it-yourself geeks out there can upgrade and repair and do all sorts of fun stuff like overclocking and the like, but we are talking about typical consumer wares here.
about final cut, you should try porting a piece of software that complex to another operating system.
the damage is cosmetic, but significantly decreases resale value, and be unacceptable to people seeking repairs.
that's because, in order to take the back cover off the iphone, you have to spend many minutes delicately prying the metal slab up.
i just think that some of their equipment is less then spectacular.
but it comes down to the fact that, when choosing between extending the life of their gadgets and making things look pretty, apple is landing on the side of pretty.
every electron you push in and pull back out diminishes the capacity a bit.
do a google search for "iphone disassemble" and there are instructions and videos with the details.
apple is forcing people into using their extremely expensive repair services, which often make buying a new device cheaper.
atleast only crashed 4 or 5 times.
apple's website displays on it's main page, bottom center, how to re-cycle any mp3, computer or mobile phone for free .
because the nano, iphone and generation 6 "classic" bodies are metal to metal the body gets completely trashed upon opening.
but brett is upset, and that makes me upset.
i have a couple of pre 2000 macs that are still running fine and one of them even runs tiger.
i know a number of people who buy apple products because the products always break within the first 6 months and they're then given a new one.
do a google search for "iphone disassemble" and there are instructions and videos with the details.
i loved how easy it was to take apart and upgrade or fix - i put a new hard drive in it myself, and of course, stuff like memory was easy.
seriously... all computers suck, and vista makes my new pc run ten times as slow.
its not my fault or apples fault that the average jackass can't use a $10 15w iron from radio shack and replace a battery.
so goes with the new "generation" of apple products, it is the same crap, different marketing.
no dvd drive means can't install newer os, old os is utterly incompatible.

if they wanted you to take it apart then there would be instructions, and a little button that says open.
you save money, create less pollution, use fewer resources.

unless this video is an elaborate hoax, it shows that the device can indeed be taken apart without damaging any of its components.
long-lasting, durable, upgradable, and fixable are just as, maybe more important than recyclable.
a 1000 dollar mac from 2002 is worthless.
it would be good to hear what apple have written by weee recycling, january 21, 2008 about their official line is on this.
if you like to be cool you have to pay.

only one other laptop made it to the genius bar during my visit.
this is all to say nothing of the fact that is underperformed similarlly priced pcs from day 1.
not only that, but they replaced my out of warranty macbook with the new model.
i can tell you that both apple laptops have totally crashed and needed repair...one of them twice.
all the energy of production and transport and packaging contributes to how "green" a product is - a less recyclable machine with a longer "shelf life" and more accessible repairs and upgrades would, in the end, be much greener than a "merely" recyclable machine.
apparently, the sixth generation ipods and the current ipod nano have been designed to be 100% unfixable.
if there wasn't this whole "green" buzzword and image branding opportunity for them they wouldn't give a hoot about it.
is it just me that suspects apple has one of the largest return rates of all the manufacturers of notebooks as well as mp3 players.
the service is cheap.
it's like recycling, but way better, because the gadgets get to keep living.
if you could match up the hardware of the pc with the mac os it would be great, but apple won't have that.
the sony was bought from the sony metreon back when i was in sf.
all manufactures should, in their own best interests (read the great book "green to gold"), prominently describe to their customers how to do this easily and effectively.
about that imac, you could probably turn it into a wired network server.
the sony was bought from the sony metreon back when i was in sf.
genius bar was always packed (for some strange reason).
i myself have had several macs over the years as well as a couple of ipods.
google, as always, is your best friend here.
remember that it has been undergoing repairs for quite a while, and some of the best computer experts in the city have looked at it.
but thanks to apple's greed, i cannot run final cut on my computer because they only let their computers run it.
that was one of the main reasons i stopped buying apple and went and bought a taiwanese made pc instead.
i actually like the fact that they are giving ms a little competition.
they wouldn't be perfect, but they would be usable.
maybe he just needs the right tools... written by robert thille, january 22, 2008 ifixit.com has photos of disassembly of the latest ipods, and it didn't look like they had to destroy the case to get it open...
it has some useful tools on it that allow you to choose a media player by comparing all of the features.
when you wear the battery out to the point it doesn't last long enough for your replace the battery.
i agree that the people there are idiots, but most people bringing their laptops are idiots!
story of stuff written by stewwy, january 22, 2008 its all about forced consumption.
they are likely replacing the case in every repair job they actually do.
that is why i pay money for machines to help me do my work... not the other way around.
girlfriend's 2002 imac: cost $1000 dollars and is worthless.
and another thing... apple products are not meant to be taken apart.
also, i should say that my friend's dual g4 is still an awesome computer after 5 years, it is just that it cost 3000 new, and my $500 pc is still better.
call and apple store and speak to one of the 6-8 managers they have next time you have a problem.
apple owners are so protective of apple.
that said, i do like apple products, or business class hp...
it has some useful tools on it that allow you to choose a media player by comparing all of the features.
i've been able to pass my old computers, including the ancient little classic mac i started with, on to folks who can use them - freecycle is great for that!
a 1000 dollar imac will still run quite happily.
apple stopped making the airport card for it.
because the nano, iphone and generation 6 "classic" bodies are metal to metal the body gets completely trashed upon opening.
in all cases with the windows pc laptops... they all crash within the first 3 days of use... mind you i bought them brand new.
i asked brett if apple maybe had special tools that allowed the to repair these metal-to-metal devices: besides charging you hundreds to fix it (which makes it more economical for most to just get a new one) they probably have to give it a whole new body whenever they open one.
that was one of the main reasons i stopped buying apple and went and bought a taiwanese made pc instead.
i swore from that day forward to only ever buy a linux-based media player.
for example:i wouldn't by an mp3 player that you couldn't easily replace the battery.
regarding the new macbook and "being just as sturdy as the plastic macbook".
their service sucked and was expensive.
according to brett, the new generations of ipods and the iphone are not designed to be opened.

apple, on the other hand, along with sony, panasonic, pioneer, toyota, honda, john deere and caterpillar, have all earned well established reputations for producing high qualityhard good products because of well thought out designs and first class quality control systems.
it still did most of what you "need" a word processing program to do today.
we got it back a couple of weeks ago and it kept dying due to a loose power connection (we think).
the result is, generally, a lot of wasted time and a slightly dented iphone panel.
i can easily open all of them without damage to upgrade ram, hds or change batteries--it's easy to find the simple tools needed and "how-to" explanations or videos on the opening process.
i don’t know how they could make a repair without trashing the body.

the aluminium and glass used in the imac, macbook, and macbook pro are highly recyclable.

however, as much as i like the software company, microsoft has a long established history of poor quality workmanship in itshardware division--just google the many thousands of painful real life reports associated with the xbox and the original zune.

apple truths written by jeff, august 21, 2008 i have owned more than 10 pc's (own a small business) and now 2 apples plus 5 ipods.
and they keep making new software that is better and better in some ways, but if you keep your old machines running, after a while, you can't run any of it any more.
i have a couple of pre 2000 macs that are still running fine and one of them even runs tiger.
we've got to keep 7 billion people happy without destroying our planet.
the iphone is simple to open up (i have no idea what this article is talking about) -- the nano is a bit more tough.
after all these years, the pb with 1.25ghz is still going strong and have never broken down on me.
i appreciate and admire quality wherever i find it.
in the nanos and shuffles, parts are actually soldered together, eliminating the possiblility of simple repair.
my friend's toshiba satellite laptop has been in the repair shop almost constantly for about a year now.

if they wanted you to take it apart then there would be instructions, and a little button that says open.
2 of 5 ipods have broken though more due to negligence than anything else.
i agree that the new zune is much easier to open and repair, but that's largely due to its plastic shell, which isn't readily recyclable like the ipod/iphone's aluminum anyway, and can occasionally crack...
that is why i pay money for machines to help me do my work... not the other way around.
that's the iphone, the nano is actually physically impossible to take apart without ripping solders.

it just happens to fit with their whole "wow were so unique and hip and cool and fresh" image.
i also own 5 pc laptops which are also relatively easy to open and upgrade (though not nearly as easy as the macs).
its 20f here, and it still runs, my car needs work, and thanks to the g3 i will have it done, while listening to the latest tool album.
i don’t know how they could make a repair without trashing the body.
you do realize that macs come with software, and for pcs it usually costs extra unless it would be free anyway (e.g. dell shipping pcs with ubuntu).
you can use something called a search engine, e.g. google, to find it.
in my family we have 4 ipod which are used a lot and have never missed a beat in two years.

i have had my macbook replaced several times for the cracked plastic case, thats why i now have the all aluminum macbook, and all it cost me was the gas to get to the apple store.
i don't own a desktop computer, so my laptop has to substitute for one.
obviously they want ipods to be disposable things that go bad and need to be replaced, there's no money in something that lasts forever and can be repaired by anyone, that doesn't generate any revenue for them.
