and, as we said before, if you want the best xp performance with the types of applications tested here, parallels is not only faster than vmware fusion, but it’s faster than boot camp on average for the applications that we tested.

this is a very good price for windows xp sp2, and is what i used for my latest windows install on my new imac.

if you want a virtualization product (that allows you to run windows alongside mac os x), and you want the best performance for the types of things that we tested, then clearly you need to run xp and not vista.
(and, although we didn’t test it, we would expect vmware fusion to have better multi-processor support if you really have an application that is designed to take advantage of it.)if your goal is tight integration between one or more windows applications and mac os x, parallels is the clear winner when running either xp or vista.
you of course need an intel-based mac, and a full copy of windows xp sp2 or windows vista (business or ultimate), in order to run windows on a mac using any of these solutions.

this is he most amazing site dude :dreply thanks for sharing this.
that said, parallels was somewhat faster in general than vmware fusion for xp.

i have personally used both boot camp and parallels, and currently have parallels v3 running on a 2.33 ghz macbook pro with 3gb ram, and a new 2.4ghz imac with 4gb ram.
the copy that came with your pc or an upgrade will not work.
to be honest, i cannot discern any difference in speed between my original implementation of boot camp and later parallels install, however, not having to reboot into each os, and the ease with which files can be shared between os’s are major advantages that parallels has over boot camp.

for a comparison, and some insights into the differences, read the parallels vs. vmware fusion shootout at apple insider.
furthermore, in our tests, both vmware fusion and parallels performed well, and were a good user experience.

it’s faster than a pc anyway.

if you don’t want mac integration, and just want to run windows, go with boot camp.
