well, i hope my little review helps, have a great day, and have a great time with the new programs!!!
also, did i mention, beatunes si free for 7 days, after that trial period, i believe it only costs, $30 bucks.
well i searched around and didn't find a thread about bpm analyzer's.
it has many customizable options, and is very easy to use, even for the not so technically inclined.
many dj's are "switching up" to computers as the new way to dj.
this is better than manually entering in your bpm's for thousands of songs, as this can take for ever!!!

for 7,000 songs took 3 days to analyze on a g4 1.67ghz laptop, and it is very accurate, it even has decimels ex: 96.4 bpms
many dj's are "switching up" to computers as the new way to dj.
as more and more dj's are converting to laptops and digital libraries, the advantage's and feature's are improving all the time.
it has many customizable options, and is very easy to use, even for the not so technically inclined.
out of 7,000+ songs it only had trouble with 4, not bad at all, in my opinion.
they provide near-instant access to large song lists and can be integrated to control video and dmx lighting.
all in all, beatunes, is stable, if your worried about it messing things up just select to analyze a couple albums, and see for your self.

it also has a sliding scale option of analyzing, that looks kinda like this.
they are ideal for running at home or left running over night as they will work in the background, you can still surf the net, etc, while it anyalyzes your whole library, it then automatically enters in the information into itunes for you.

one great option is, you can tell it to only analyze the songs without the bpm's, so if you already have half your library with bpm's it will only analyze the other half.
