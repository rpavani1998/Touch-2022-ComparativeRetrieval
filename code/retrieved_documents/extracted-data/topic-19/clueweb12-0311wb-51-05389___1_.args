2 months later after 2 months i am still happy with my purchase and these things please me: how the mac looks: the computer is beautiful and can site in any room and actually be a feature how few wires are needed.the reasons for doing this were plentiful, and overall i’m happy with my experience so far, but i wanted to talk about why i switched, what’s better and what i miss about a pc.they seemed very similar to pcs except with a few distinct disadvantages: office documents created on a mac often looked funny on a pc virtual pc was pretty awful and it was very difficult to test websites in internet explorer on windowsi started to think about macs – a lot of the bloggers, that i read and respect, seemed to be using them and getting good results.to address your specific complaints: - don’t bother with finder, get quicksilver for super-fast keyboard shortcuts to everything you need - mamp (www.mamp.info) is the mac equivalent of xampp, and is actually much easier to set up, and has a built in port and php version switcher in the gui - aptana has a pretty decent ftp manager built-in, plus it has site synchronisation as well -i certainly don’t miss vista, in particular, my computer now freezes less, cds are recognised and itunes works again meaning i can use a computer properly again in my post-vista world.windows has the excellentxampp so setting up a local web server is easy – it also hasgreat ftp programs like filezilla, awesome css writing programs liketopstyleit also crashed a lot more, gave me grey screens that asked me to press ok a lot and often froze for minutes at a time with the screen literally frosted over with a light blue tint.another thing to add is that having a mac means you can sync your address book and ical with your iphone. :)i’m using xp sp2, and it’s super zippy, very usable, and perfect for browser testing.it gave my pc a low vista compatibility rating which meant it never ran the sexy aero interface.to answer my original question which i just realised i hadn’t, so far web development isn’t any easier on a mac.i installed vista as soon as it was released (because my pc had a virus, which i had a feeling vista would cure – and it did).you can follow any responses to this entry through therss 2.0 feed.so i had to copy and paste one exception was, as opposed to windows ctrl+alt+delete technique which allows you to close troublesome programs, apple’s ‘force quit’ (apple+option+esc) performed its duty marvelously.
