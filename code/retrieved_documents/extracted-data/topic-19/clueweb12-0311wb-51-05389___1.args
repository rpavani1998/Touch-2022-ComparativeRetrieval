it gave my pc a low vista compatibility rating which meant it never ran the sexy aero interface.

after months of deliberation, and waiting for the new os x to come out i finally bought a mac.
i kept getting told by all the other mac fanatics that i’d soon change my mind.
the reasons for doing this were plentiful, and overall i’m happy with my experience so far, but i wanted to talk about why i switched, what’s better and what i miss about a pc.
windows has the excellentxampp so setting up a local web server is easy – it also hasgreat ftp programs like filezilla, awesome css writing programs liketopstyle
but you can’t use it to test css in safari/camino and thats where a mac edges it for me.

i started to think about macs – a lot of the bloggers, that i read and respect, seemed to be using them and getting good results.
to answer my original question which i just realised i hadn’t, so far web development isn’t any easier on a mac.
i certainly don’t miss vista, in particular, my computer now freezes less, cds are recognised and itunes works again meaning i can use a computer properly again in my post-vista world.
i installed vista as soon as it was released (because my pc had a virus, which i had a feeling vista would cure – and it did).
they seemed very similar to pcs except with a few distinct disadvantages: office documents created on a mac often looked funny on a pc virtual pc was pretty awful and it was very difficult to test websites in internet explorer on windows
i think windows’ explorer edges that one: i don’t ‘get’ the usefulness of cover-flow summary i’m glad i’ve now got a mac, i don’t the miss the pc.

reply thanks for your comment matthew: i’m currently using a combo of mamp pro, transmit, dreamweaver to get things done and it’s working out very nicely.

parallels worksmuch nicer with xp than it does with vista – i think that’s vista problem rather than parellels.
to address your specific complaints: - don’t bother with finder, get quicksilver for super-fast keyboard shortcuts to everything you need - mamp (www.mamp.info) is the mac equivalent of xampp, and is actually much easier to set up, and has a built in port and php version switcher in the gui - aptana has a pretty decent ftp manager built-in, plus it has site synchronisation as well -
it also crashed a lot more, gave me grey screens that asked me to press ok a lot and often froze for minutes at a time with the screen literally frosted over with a light blue tint.
i agree about the mice, although you get used to it after a while.

because you couldn’t get any games for it – while my friends were able to buy new pc games in the shop – i was stuck playing the default games.

so i had to copy and paste one exception was, as opposed to windows ctrl+alt+delete technique which allows you to close troublesome programs, apple’s ‘force quit’ (apple+option+esc) performed its duty marvelously.
i know have 3 plugs: 1 for the mac, 1 for the printer and 1 for the router stacks it isn’t vista and these things don’t: the mice are rubbish (even the mighty mouse) it randomly stops scrolling and gets very dirty very quickly parallels is good but its only seems like a (much) more reliable version of virtual pc and not the ground breaking amazing piece of kit promised by the blogosphere finder isn’t great:

add your comment i’ve just recently switched to using a mac at home too (after my pc died at christmas), although i’ve had a mac at work for the last couple of years.

2 months later after 2 months i am still happy with my purchase and these things please me: how the mac looks: the computer is beautiful and can site in any room and actually be a feature how few wires are needed.
i’d also heard about bootcamp/parallels and knew running windows on a mac and, therefore, testing on internet explorer would be easier than the other way around, but i was put off by the price.
i’m using xp sp2, and it’s super zippy, very usable, and perfect for browser testing.
i installed vista as soon as it was released (because my pc had a virus, which i had a feeling vista would cure – and it did).

another thing to add is that having a mac means you can sync your address book and ical with your iphone. :)
aside from the complete lack of games (don’t care any more, that’s what the wii is for), i find it much better for just about everything.
after months of deliberation, and waiting for the new os x to come out i finally bought a mac.
