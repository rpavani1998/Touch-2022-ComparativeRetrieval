for the most part, the two systems are comparable, indicating that at least for a laptop, apple’s pricing fits in line with comparable hardware.in terms of hardware, there’s nothing really special about a mac aside from elegant designs, be it a mac pro or macbook pro, that makes it incredibly more worthwhile than the pc equivalent.we know what we're buying, we know what each piece of hardware is capable of doing, you can't just throw fancy numbers at us and expect us to fall for it.the pc will always win in the price category (and usually performance as well) because you pay for the reliability and style of apple.high end specialty systems are always going to draw a high price; that is to be expected; that apple is competitive in the $3000 range does not matter to the vast vast majority of people who spend not even half that.certain things like shared memory for graphics leave some performance desires for the xps, but the xps has a strong leg up on the macbook pro with the larger screen size.i have seen several incidences where people have tripped over or through someone else’s macbook pro power cord and the magsafe design literally saved the laptops from flying.you can build a pc with hardware that isn't identical but performs better for cheaper.for a laptop that dell indicates is a gaming machine, shared memory is a disappointment, as graphics is an important area for 3d gaming.apple’s macbook pro has several small advantages over the xps, mainly with the magsafe connector and it’s nearly take-for-granted use.i respect the fact that you 'tried' (keyword here is tried) to show the good qualities of mac computers, however this is mainly an enthusiast site, so you will be very hard pressed to fool us into thinking apple offerings are anywhere near as good as others (especially on price/performance ratio).i realize that when you're going the apple route you don't have many options, but those of us on the pc side have tons of options... and even the most basic among us would be able to purchase higher performing, lower cost pcs than the ones you selected to go up against the apples.the biggest differences are the screen size, weight, thickness, and shared memory.the point is you can pick a pc with cheaper hardware that can perform better.for the same price the windows package runs the same cpu, 4gb memory, a 320gb hdd, better graphics, 16" screen 16:9 widescreen, a choice of 3 nice cases, wireless 300n router, microsoft office home and student and a logitech vxnano wireless mouse.
