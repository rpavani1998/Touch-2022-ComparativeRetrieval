since the hardware and software have been designed by the same company and with each other in mind, it has produced a system (in my experience) that is incredibly robust, doesn’t crash and can upgrade itself with little or no impact on my daily work.most people i know that own a mac tell me how much better they are than pcs, yet plenty of pc owners are hesitant about making the switch, or happily maintain that there are benefits to working with a pc.i think there is a fundamental cognitive bias at play in reviews – if people have paid a lot for a product they are likely to rate it highly as no one likes to admit they bought the wrong thing.macs are (very broadly speaking) great for users like your dad who don’t have or indeed wish to acquire a whole load of technical knowledge.it’s operating system is easy to use, it “just works”, it looks nice in the house, and, most importantly, it doesn’t throw up lot’s of error messages which, like many old-school parents, he would read and try to understand.one very good thing about macs is that they maintain a lot of their value when sold secondhand.research shows, macs do not last longer and are no more reliable than most machines designed for windows.yes macs are more expensive but it is a relief to use a computer where things work and the design is so user friendly.being an open rather than closed technology pcs are more likely to work with any device you plug in or attachment you try to open.on the advice of a friend, i switched to a mac laptop, and have been able to teach myself to email, download my photos and send them, browse the internet, write letters etc.the mac tends to be built with decent quality components and if you were to buy a similarly spec’d pc, the difference in price gets much less.you cannot buy a cheap mac, but they are priced competitively with equivalent quality pcs, so price is not a big issue.the fact that the os is so robust on a mac actually makes it much more difficult to get into it and make it do what i want.true, they are still less liable to malware attack, but that’s not because osx is better than windows, it’s because windows users make a far tastier target because there are so many more of them.i need an awful lot of different programmes for an awful lot of tasks and pc offers a much wider variety and, because of that, better pricing.
