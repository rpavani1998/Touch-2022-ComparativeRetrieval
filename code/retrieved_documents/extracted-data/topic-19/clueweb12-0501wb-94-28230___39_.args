new features included liveupdate virus definition updates over the internet, enhanced macro virus protection, automatic file repair, a bootable cd-rom for emergencies, faster scanning for ppc, and a universal safezone.however, charging for this particular utility puts it into the same arena as the commercial scanners which detect a far wider range of threats and for which full support is available, an area in which it cannot at present compete.however, leaving such an infected disk in the drive while booting an emulator such as softpc can mean that the virus attempts to infect the logical pc drive with unpredictable results.the costs of not establishing these measures can be considerable, irrespective of damage caused on infected machines, especially in corporate environments.even benign viruses (apparently non-destructive viruses) cause significant damage by occupying disk space and/or main memory, by using up cpu processing time, by introducing the risk of incompatibilities and conflicts, and by the time and expense wasted in detecting and removing them.++office 98 applications are in principle vulnerable to most of the threats to which office 97 applications are vulnerable.virex, nav, and sam [obsolete] all address a full range of threats, including trojans and macro viruses, and can do scheduled scanning as well as on-access (memory-resident) scanning.* cryptographic checksummers use an encryption algorithm to lessen the risk of being fooled by a virus that targets that particular checksummer.virex offers very fast scanning is easy to update, and includes checksumming for the detection of unknown viruses.this should also prevent infection by future malware exploiting the same loophole, but will fail if a setup is booted from a volume with an infected extensions folder [sl].this document is intended to help individuals with computer virus-related problems and queries, and clarify the issue of computer viruses on macintosh platforms.indeed, these viruses can, potentially, infect other files on any hardware platform supporting these versions of these applications.unfortunately, this can be counterproductive in real life, since an over-stringent alert policy is apt to result in the facility being turned off altogether.the main reason for this is that he doesn't have the resources to extend its capabilities to detect macro viruses, which have become by far the most significant virus problem for most macintosh users.since word 6.x for macintosh supports wordbasic macros, it is as vulnerable as word 6.x and 7.x on intel platforms to being infected by macro viruses, and therefore to generating other infected documents (or, strictly speaking, templates).
