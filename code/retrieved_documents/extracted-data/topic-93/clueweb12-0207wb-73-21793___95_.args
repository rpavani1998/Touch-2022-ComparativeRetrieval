we will teach basic skills, foster creative and critical thinking, and provide a foundation for life-long learning.they help maintain the health of our environment by controlling rodents, woodchucks, insects and other prolific animals and serve as one of nature’s “clean-up services” by removing dead animals and preventing disease.this significantly diminishes the value of wildlife habitat, in terms of food sources and nesting areas, and has a negative impact upon the number of species that use the river corridor.we will nourish our students’ emotional lives and guide their social development, instilling in them an appreciation of self-worth, of individual difference, and of global interdependence.peat harvesting has a huge adverse impact on wildlife and the environment.many other scavenger animals such as foxes, crows and hawks, benefit from coyote predation on other animals through increased food availability.we will help them learn how to manage freedom and to act ethically so that each may become a responsible, contributing member of society.coyotes, as well as other wildlife, are continuously adapting to living with people and are opportunistic in finding foods and resources that are available.this is a time when we need to come together as a community and make tough choices about what we can afford and what we might need to do without, but it is imperative that we do so while having complete information so we can make informed, calculated decisions while preserving the tradition of excellence that we all have worked so hard to achieve.coyotes are a medium sized predator, an opportunistic feeder and extremely adaptable to a wide range of habitats, quickly adjusting to changes in the landscape and are now found in all areas of the town and region.while it has been suggested that barefoot, toe-strike running may ultimately be less injurious, these data indicate that the transition into barefoot running presents a high risk period for musculoskeletal injury to the lower extremities.although free roaming pets are more likely to be killed by automobiles than by wild animals, coyotes do view cats and small dogs as easy prey and are at risk year round.indigenous plants attract indigenous insects that not only carry out pollination but also keep pests from proliferating.it provides good exercise and at the same time there is no increase in noise or air pollution.fast-growing, tenacious vines are among the worst of the foreign plants that threaten to overwhelm local habitats.
