rain barrel systems can be a great way to harvest rain water to supplement irrigation needs.the green building industry is slowly but steadily advancing water conservation and rain water collection in its strategies; and cisterns provide a means to store the rainwater for later use.in most climates, rain barrel systems should be valued for the rainwater’s superior quality (no chlorine, chloramines and other treatment chemicals) as irrigation water.in whatever size and form, rainwater harvesting usually is one of the purest waters available of all the alternate water sources.despite its imitial purity, rain water can be easily contaminated by: air-pollution; heavy metals and other toxins in roofing materials, paints, solvents, lead soldering, zinc coatings and adhesives; bird and rodent feces; and mosquitoes.despite its imitial purity, rain water can be easily contaminated by: air-pollution; heavy metals and other toxins in roofing materials, paints, solvents, lead soldering, zinc coatings and adhesives; bird and rodent feces; and mosquitoes.in rural areas, the advances in well drilling technology allows for deeper wells, where groundwater levels seldom fall below well depth.these water sources are non-potable, and vary greatly in quality.most of the on-site water resources have limited application, and are never suitable for human consumption.this water may collect many pollutants as it travels across landscapes and hardscapes.managing stormwater in urban environments has reached near crises levels in some us cities as urban sprawl grows and landscapes are paved over with non-porous materials (concrete and asphalt).while it is true that the rainwater can be used to flush toilets, the added cost of equipment to convey the water to the toilets might hamper overall cost effectiveness; one barrel of water is unlikely to supply more than 3 days worth of flushing water for the typical home.while it is true that the rainwater can be used to flush toilets, the added cost of equipment to convey the water to the toilets might hamper overall cost effectiveness; one barrel of water is unlikely to supply more than 3 days worth of flushing water for the typical home.the quality of stormwater varies greatly from different sites; the water quality determines the appropriate uses, or if water treatment is needed before the water is utilized.(rain water is superior to treated potable water for irrigating plants.)
