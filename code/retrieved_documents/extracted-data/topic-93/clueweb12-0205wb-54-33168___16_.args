a major shift to bottled water could undermine funding for tap water protection, raising serious equity issues for the poor.the underfunded and haphazard patchwork of regulatory programs have found numerous cases where bottled water has been contaminated at levels above state or federal standards.a credible independent third-party-nongovernmental organization should establish a "certified safe" bottled water program that is truly open, ensures full compliance with all fda, epa, state, industry, and international standards and guidelines, does twice-a-year surprise inspections, documents sufficient source protection and treatment to meet epa/centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) criteria forcryptosporidium-safe bottled water, and makes readily available (including on the web) all inspections and monitoring results.though usually limited in scope, these studies also have found that most bottled water meets applicable enforceable standards, but that a minority of waters contain chemical or microbiological contaminants of potential concern.thus, while much tap water is supplied by systems that have violated epa standards or that serve water containing substantial levels of risky contaminants, apparently the majority of the country's tap water passes epa standards.manufacture and shipping of billions of bottles causes unnecessary energy and petroleum consumption, leads to landfilling or incineration of bottles, and can release environmental toxins.bottled water sometimes is contaminated, and we don't use it to bathe, shower, etc. – major routes of exposure for some tap water contaminants.about one third of the bottled waters we tested contained significant contamination (i.e., levels of chemical or bacterial contaminants exceeding those allowed under a state or industry standard or guideline) in at least one test.any violation of tap-water standards is grounds for enforcement – but bottled water in violation of standards can still be sold if it is labeled as "containing excessive chemicals" or "excessive bacteria" (unless fda finds it "adulterated," a term not specifically defined).immune-compromised or other vulnerable people particularly may want such certification to be fully confident of their bottled water's purity.in addition, many waters contained arsenic, nitrates, or other inorganic contaminants at levels below current standards.therefore, while much tap water is indeed risky, having compared available data we conclude that there is no assurance that bottled water is any safer than tap water.nearly one in five tested waters (18 of the 103, or 17 percent) contained, in at least one sample, more bacteria than allowed under microbiological-purity "guidelines" (unenforceable sanitation guidelines based on heterotrophic plate count [hpc] bacteria levels in the water) adopted by some states, the industry, and the eu.for purposes of comparison, we note that epa recently reported that in 1996 about 1 in 10 community tap water systems (serving about one seventh of the u.s. population) violated epa's tap water treatment or contaminant standards, and 28 percent of tap water systems violated significant water-monitoring or reporting requirements.the long-term solution to our water woes is to fix our tap water so it is safe for everyone, and tastes and smells good.
