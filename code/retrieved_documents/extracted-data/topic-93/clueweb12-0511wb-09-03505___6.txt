i've read that for radiation carbon filters like brita and pur can help but  they're not as effective as reverse osmosis filters.
especially since those tests don't cover everything.
i'm hoping that the soil filtration plus the brita water filter i'm using will be enough to keep it safe.

trust me i own a well, 5 stage ro +uv you can buy for about 300-400 on amazon fukushima or not buy that!
submitted by anonymous on fri, 2011-04-22 10:01 berkeley radiological air and water monitoring forum is well water more or less likely to be affected than regular tap water?
my well has a complicated filtration system on it  itself as well for filtering out iron and other things, so i'm hoping all these  things together (soil, well filter, brita filter) are giving me water that's at  least as safe as berkeley tap water, which at last check is showing no  detectable levels.

she said it seemed like a drug allergy
a brita filter doesnt remove jack squat.
further, we have found that the runoff is very much  diluted relative to pure rain water so most of the reservoir water that comes  from runoff is already diluted from soil filtering.
i can't drive myself crazy thinking about this
i'd never been  allergic to anything except dust mites, and that was pretty mild compared to  this.

i lived in north carolina once and the property had well water.

however, tap water is (e.g. from east bay mud) is normally pulled from the bottoms of large reservoirs in the sierra (this is not always the case) and travel through closed aqueducts to a treatment facility then pumped to tanks that feed the tap supply.

we had a well but only  bathed in the water we didn't drink it.
we did do a radon test in the house inspection and the readings were average for the region.
i was later informed that the well could  contain arsenic.
anywhow, i  drank it and noticed a strange taste.
i hope so, since i already use one, but i do not know about it filtering out radiation.
the source is the reservoir has a dilution factor based on how much  water inventory was there before the event and how much contaminated rain fell  in the immediate area.

i have a tds meter and sometimes the tds rating is higher than from the tap when i test culligan or brita filters.
it would be nice to have a  clear answer on that, though.
well water is normally drawn from ground  water which seeps down the soil from rainfall.
that said, if the brawn team is interested in testing well  water (and soil, too) from the sierra foothills, i'd be happy to provide  samples.

despite the fact that the water passed the inspection test i just didn't feel comfortable drinking it.
we had a well but only bathed in the water we didn't drink it.
so i'm gathering my well water is pretty safe  to drink considering the filtration that takes place as the rainwater travels  thru the soil, rocks, etc.
i really wish i could get it tested, though.

i'm on well water, too, and have been wondering the same thing.

and i expect ground water supplies would have less contamination than just rain water run off.

you need to check your well out for something like that.
anywhow, i drank it and noticed a strange taste.
i should add that for two years after i moved back my hair fell out.

when this whole fukushima thing went down i got curious about how far i've been living from nuclear reactors all my life.
that said, if the brawn team is interested in testing well water (and soil, too) from the sierra foothills, i'd be happy to provide samples.
thank you for quick reply....
we have found that the soil and  rocks are an extremely good filter for these nuclides
any other info anyone else can provide would be greatly appreciated.
low and behold my north carolina home was within 20 miles of a nuclear plant.

my doctor said it was  "effluvium" and she, pardon the pun, brushed it off.
i lived in north carolina for 6 months back in 2007.
but i don't take anything that's known to cause allergic reactions.
do brita water filters remove radiation?
i don't know if that was the reason for my  hives

if you drink well water without ro + uv sanitizing you are making a huge mistake.
