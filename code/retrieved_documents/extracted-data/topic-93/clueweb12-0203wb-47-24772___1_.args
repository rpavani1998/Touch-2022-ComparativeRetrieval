rain water is not full of all the chemicals found in city water and its full of nutrients absorbed during the evaporation process that leads to rain.just as the evaporation process will leave behind bad chemicals that may be in the water, it will also leave behind nutrients (good chemicals) that are in the water.we have new bushes and flowers to water daily and this would be very helpful and convenient!it's a great way to conserve but it doesn't seem very practical.not only is the water free, but it is also free of the chemicals that are found in tap water, as mentioned in the tip.we place them under rain gutters and haven't had to run our pump and well yet to get water for the yard and garden.i love using stuff from nature in gardening, and what's more natural than the water that falls from the sky?in addition to collecting rain water i also add in a fertilizer stick and the combination seems to be amazing for my house plants.i never would have thought to collect rain water to water my plants, but it makes perfect sense!not only is it more pleasant to smell when using and helps your budget because its free, the plants love it.one slight disagreement, though, is that the rainwater will not be full of nutrients as stated in the tip.by scott lilly (delaware, oh, usa) for the past two years, i have been collecting rain water to water my garden plants with instead of using city what from the garden hose.i also use the water that i replace from my fish tanks instead of throwing it out.jul 09, 2008 rating try fish tank water, too by: anonymous i collect rain water also and my plants are doing great.anonymous i am just curious if you use a cistern to collect the water, or if you use your gutters.
