your kidneys will do that for you.
reservoirs run dry and all the muck in the bottom gets into the pipes and out of the taps.
well they suck it out of the dam, near the dam wall just below the surface off the shoreline, where the algae and other unspeakables float in the water and get sucked right up.
columns from the other side — 15 september 2011 by rick van rossum water, water, everywhere, not a drop to drink.
now that i’ve got your attention, where does the sewage works get the water from, why from the kind people in joburg, where it’s been through their kidneys already.
that’s about it, don’t think that there are any fancy chemicals or systems that will filter out pharmaceuticals, chemicals or minerals that could harm you.
well i would rather start with clear and clean water and add whatever minerals i choose to add to my diet, than rely on chance and drink whatever toxic poisons are collected on the way through all the industrial waste and not to forget all that amd, acid mine drainage, everyone is talking about.
the sewage works of joburg of course, silly.

if you’re lucky it’ll get rid of it, if not, don’t ask.
then it’s passed through a sand filter, like your pool, and when it’s available, some chlorine is put in to kill off bacteria before it is pushed up to the reservoirs.
when they try to push too much through, the process just doesn’t cope and it is not treated properly.

in my opinion use one of these reverse osmoses, ro, gadgets with the built in filters that’ll take out the obvious muck, taste and smell, then pushes it through a very fine membrane and you’ll get the best water you can get.
the water is run for a short distance to let some of the sediment settle out, then fine air bubbles are released under it, which gets hold of most of the algae and lets it float to the top where it is scooped off.
take care of yourselves, if you can’t be sure of the water from the tap, treat it before you drink it.

why is there muck, it’s because the water wasn’t cleaned properly in the first place.
