a recent study by the pacific institute, energy implications of bottled water has forever ruined fiji water for me.
in past decades fijian farmers have starved because there wasn’t enough water for irrigation, which calls into question the wisdom of shipping fijian water overseas to be sold as a luxury item.
the company has promised to reduce its emissions and packaging, use more renewable energy, and use carbon offsets, as well as protect their source’s watershed, the sovi basin rainforest.
when i do, i often buy “fiji” water.
and they don’t come close to being as green as municipal water, which skips the carbon-heavy bottles altogether.
however, none of those intentions can diminish the fact that fiji bottled water travels over 5000 miles by air or boat to get to san francisco.
something all the bottled water companies have in common these days, however, is aggressive greenwashing.
it turns out fiji runs one of the most surreal and manipulative of the campaigns.
a study by the natural resources defense council found more than the allowed amount of bacteria in more than one fifth of 103 tested brands.

for example, whereas municipal water must be tested for fecal coliform bacteria 100 times per month, a little over 3 times a day, bottled water plants only have to check once a week.
however, it is also the most energy-intensive form of purification, and is no real guarantee of quality since the membranes themselves are susceptible to bacterial colonization.
but considering the environmental costs of producing bottled water, the fact that there is no proven health benefit to drinking it makes it even crazier to choose bottled water over tap.
fiji can’t realistically claim to be any more environmentally responsible than companies who transport water a shorter distance.

to say fiji water is “good” for the environment is quite a stretch.
dasani, by coca cola, goes for mystery with its shapely blue bottle and “mouthwatering” mineral formula.
but considering the environmental costs of producing bottled water, the fact that there is no proven health benefit to drinking it makes it even crazier to choose bottled water over tap.
reverse osmosis, which forces water through a selectively-permeable membrane, is theoretically the best technology for purification, and companies like aquafina and dasani use it in their plants.

and those of us who can’t afford bottled water will be stuck with a broken system– a situation reminiscent of marie antoinette’s disastrous pronouncement, “let them eat cake.”

food and water watch in their aggressive anti-bottled water and anti-water privatization campaign, point out that quality testing standards are far less stringent for bottled water than for municipal supplies.
“artesian” means that fiji water is from an authentic spring– and the spring is indeed on the island of fiji.

americans spent $11 billion on bottled water in 2006, and drank over 33 billion liters in 2007, which works out to about 30 gallons per person.
and bottled water, unlike constantly moving municipal water, is stagnant, and therefore more conducive to bacterial replication.
$6 billion of the stimulus package was set aside for local clean and drinking water infrastructure improvements, which have been neglected for far too long.

more seriously, however, it reflects americans’ fundamental distrust of public water systems.

the two biggest energy sucks are production of the bottles (it takes the energetic equivalent of 50 million barrels of oil per year to produce the bottles) and transportation of the bottles to their final destination.
for one thing, we need better risk assessment.
concerns about deteriorating public water infrastructure, and trace contaminants that the epa doesn’t regulate are harder to dispel than misleading advertisements.

finally, there is little evidence to support the idea that bottled water is any better for you than tap water.

but it will take more than infrastructure improvements to regain america’s trust in the tap.
nevertheless, i buy bottled water sometimes, especially on long car trips.

otherwise, we will be increasingly forced to drink water that isn’t significantly safer, but still costs us more than gasoline.
