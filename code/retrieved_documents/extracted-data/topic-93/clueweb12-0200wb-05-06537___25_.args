petroleum repels water, and water-soluble petroleum-based leachates are likely to be susceptible to quick decomposition by soil microbes.they reduce or eliminate runoff of stormwater into our watershed, which means less downstream pollution and sedimentation.we need to change our thinking to become more sustainable as a society, and rain barrels are a very good way to achieve that end.they collect naturally soft, chlorine-free rainwater for use on our plants, which may result in increased plant health (though our petroleum-based roofing products and bird poop contribute their own pollution to the mix, sorry to say).for all but the summer drought it supplies all my irrigation needs when combined with xeriscaping and deep mulch techniques.for families using rain barrels, water is suddenly a resource to be harvested, not a utility to be paid.weather patterns are becoming completely erratic in some places, and sometimes it seems hard to justify watering flowers and veg when there's a drought going on.two rain barrels alone don't provide enough water to see us through the dry spells and they quickly overflow during floods.the only way a rain barrel system would benefit my small suburban garden is if it was paired up with a grey water system and i modified my sub- tropical plant collection habit to include only drought tolerant plants.i use the rainwater mostly for potted plants or to water recently-transplanted seedlings.they reduce the load on our municipal water supplies.even here in the east where we've been having prolonged droughts, global weirding has also brought more severe downpours, so the runoff problem is just getting worse.i also appreciate being able to water my acid-loving plants (i know i should be growing plants more suitable to the soil i have, but i just can't bring myself to give up the luxury of my own blueberry patch!) with low ph rainwater.they save (a little) on our water bills, though not enough to justify using them on the basis of cost alone.veggies were planted more closely than recommended so that leaves completely shaded the earth once the plants were part grown, as the beds had at least 14 hours of sun a day.
