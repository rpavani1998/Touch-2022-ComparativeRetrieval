studies have shown that circumcision, far from being a harmless and painless procedure, is one of the most painful procedures that can be performed on an infant and has potentially far-reaching detrimental physical and psychological consequences.teas are one of the most effective ways to benefit from nature's healing herbs teas can help fight depression and anxiety, heal skin conditions and gastrointestinal disorders, regulate hormone imbalances, improve your sex life, prevent illness, and help you heal faster.water must be available to carry vital elements, oxygen, hormones, and chemical messengers to all parts of the body.if there is insufficient water, the toxins become concentrated and can result in severe "clogging" of the kidneys, resulting in dangerous kidney disorders and even kidney failure.these treatments can be safer, less expensive and possibly even more effective than traditional methods.the risk of contracting serious diseases from bottle feeding is therefore high, but it is further compounded by the fact that, in the third world, many people don't have access to a clean water supply with which to make up the formula, and poverty can lead to mothers over-diluting the formula to make it go further.high soy diet during pregnancy and nursing may cause developmental changes in children two separate studies one in animals and the other in humans, suggest that a diet high in soybeans and other legumes during pregnancy and breastfeeding may have a subtle but long-term impact on the development of children.high soy diet during pregnancy and nursing may cause developmental changes in children two separate studies â€“ one in animals and the other in humans, suggest that a diet high in soybeans and other legumes during pregnancy and breastfeeding may have a subtle but long-term impact on the development of children.as a result of extensive research into the role of water in the body, the author, a medical doctor, believes that he has found chronic dehydration to be the cause of many conditions including asthma, allergies, arthritis, angina, migraine headaches, hypertension, raised cholesterol, chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple sclerosis, depression, and diabetes in the elderly.they usually feel safer, more grounded and more in touch with themselves and their environment.this book explains a new discovery that lack of water in the body--chronic dehydration--is the root cause of many painful degenerative diseases, asthma, allergies, hypertension, excss body weight, andsome emotional problems including depression.the antibiotics amoxicillan and ampicillin accounted for 24 per cent of total adverse reactions, with vaccines coming in second at 19 per cent.soy can cause severe allergic reactions soy, like its botanically-related cousin the peanut, could be responsible for severe, potentially fatal, cases of food allergy, particularly in children with asthma who are also very sensitive to peanuts.perhaps the greatest benefit of hpmt is that it presents a unique opportunity for children, parents and guardians to feel empowered and confident while learning about safe and nurturing touch.babies who are breastfed are reportedly less likely to get sick (with diarrhea, gastrointestinal illness, urinary-tract infections, respiratory disease, pneumonia or sudden infant death syndrome (sids), less likely to have allergies, less likely to have later weight problems, less likely to have ear infections, and -- according to a study published in themay 8, 2002, issue of the journal of the american medical association -- likely to be more intelligent.
