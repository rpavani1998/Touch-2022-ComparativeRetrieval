the calcium comes out instead in ionic form (with a positive charge) and precipitates by forming other salts.

if they are present in excess then they are filtered through the kidneys and this is exactly what needs to happen with all things which are in excess in the circulation.

finally, if mineral water is not a good source of biologically available minerals, then what is?
carbonate is not a sufficiently complex organic molecule and therefore cannot properly contribute its calcium to living systems.
this makes dust of the argument that healthy water is mineralized, and dust is of course the source of minerals in mineral water.
nature knows best and nature supplies distilled water in the form of rain.
your mineral source should be plants not water.
this point of view is that water should be mineralized in order to have health benefits and that distilled water somehow leaches out minerals from the body.
water from the ground comes with minerals alright, but these minerals are in salt form.
distilled water cleanses the body through promoting healthy kidney function.
finally, if mineral water is not a good source of biologically available minerals, then what is?
if you have a severe medical condition, see your physician of choice.
distilled water does not leach out significant amounts of biologically available minerals because these are quickly taken up by the body on an as needed basis.
water from the ground comes with minerals alright, but these minerals are in salt form.
the purpose of water is to cleanse the body.
carbon based molecules are to be found in living systems, and are not found in the ground which is where mineral water comes from.
distilled water vs mineral, carbon filtered and reverse osmosis water ron kennedy, m.d. there is circulating a point of view about distilled water, undoubtedly promulgated by producers and sellers of mineral water.
to do the best job of that, it must be free of everything else.
it does not cause mineral loss but in fact takes out harmful toxins from the body.
a good example is caco3 (calcium carbonate).
minerals are present in the ground and must be biologically bound in order to be used by the body.
if you want cataracts, kidney stones, and arteriosclerosis, be sure to eat and drink “calcium enriched” foods.
unbound minerals must be excreted, which is extra work for the kidneys) or stored.
as to carbon filtered and reverse osmosis water, these are better solutions than tap water or mineral water, however they still fall far short of the standard set by distilled water.

only distilled water fits that bill.
common locations for precipitation of calcium are the lens of the eye (cataracts), the kidneys (kidney stones) and the walls of arteries (arteriosclerosis).
to understand the truth about this matter one must know a little about mineral chemistry in living systems.

the minerals it leaches out are of the unusable, ionic form and we want these to leave the body rather than be deposited and cause disease.
