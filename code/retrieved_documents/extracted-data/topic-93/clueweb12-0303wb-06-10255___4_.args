mulches can prevent excessive runoff, restrict weed growth, improve soil structure and help put valuable nutrients back into the soil.soil and dissolved nutrients are carried away with runoff, which increases the need for expensive fertiliser and can pollute nearby streams.aerating taps are inexpensive and can reduce water flow by 50 per cent.this increases the moisture holding capacity of sandy soils and allows better penetration of water into heavy clay soils.reducing the amount of water used in the home can reduce the cost of waste water treatment and could delay the increase of the waste water treatment plant capacity.all of the water used in the home, for example, clothes and dish washing, baths and showers, toilet flushing, leaking taps and toilet cisterns, is discharged to the sewer for treatment and disposal at the waste water treatment plant.this will give the water a chance to soak in and reduces water lost as runoff.too many plants are pampered to the point where they are so dependent on water that they do not go out of their way to find any water themselves.this avoids wasting water while waiting for hot water to flow through and saves power.many natives are both attractive and suited to gardens, and thrive with far less watering than do other species.front loading machines are generally more efficient than top loaders and save water and power.this ensures that any runoff water soaks into lower dry areas rather than being wasted.this is just as effective as running water and far less wasteful.by grouping plants by water usage you can avoid waste on plants that don't need a lot of water.a continuously running toilet can waste more than 16,000 litres of water per year.
