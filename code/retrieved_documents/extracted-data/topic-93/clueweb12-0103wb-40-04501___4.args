watering a little every day encourages lots of surface roots and the plants never really get enough moisture.
in this feature - water in the cool, water well not often when to water, watering systems watering seedlings, water wise design watering containers, don't over water water in the cool of the day one key factor to remember is that watering in the heat of the day is not as effective as morning or evening watering, as the sun will evaporate precious droplets, especially if you use a sprinkler.
as a rule 25mm (1 inch) of water is enough to penetrate the soil to a depth of 12-15cm (approx 1 foot) and that is sufficient for most grasses, ground covers and perennials.
you can water less frequently if you give your plants a good soaking.
this is a barrier to subsequent watering or rain; it may prevent the essential exchange of air and gases.
spray irrigation can simply erode precious topsoil as it drains away.
a down pipe from your garden shed running into the barrel will collect rain water, a dipper is all that is needed to have a good supply of fresh, clear water.
dramatic instances of water shortages and restrictions highlight how water-greedy some gardens can be.
with experience you will be able to judge the water needs of different areas within your garden.

or you can dig about 8 - 10 cm (3 - 4 inches) into the soil and see what the moisture content is like beneath the surface.
the water on the soil surface will also dry up more quickly.
the simplest method of testing the moisture content in the soil is by rolling a little bit of soil in your hand.
you want to water the roots, rather than the leaves and certainly not have the water evaporate in the air before the plants can get to it.

if you have heavy falls of rain you will need to install a system of dry streambeds (also called 'swales'), drains filled with gravel or sump holes to move water quickly and safely away from the house and border.
keeping rainfall records, or checking the local paper, will tell you whether a shower wet or merely dampened the soil.
and, by watering a large area and not just the plants, spray irrigation can result in a burgeoning weed population, competing with your precious plants for water.
don't expect the surface to be moist all of the time.
you want to water the roots, rather than the leaves and certainly not have the water evaporate in the air before the plants can get to it.
watering with a strong force of water, or with large droplets, results in a crusty layer forming on the top of the soil.
a surface 'crust' can be enough to prevent seedlings coming through the soil surface.
if you merely wet the surface of the soil it will quickly dry out again, leaving plants gasping for water.

trees and shrubs are more deeply rooted and need the water to penetrate further.

light surface watering encourages the roots towards the surface where they are more vulnerable to dryness and heat, rather than deeper into the soil.
in very bright sunny weather, the water can actually scorch the plants, as the sun reflects on the water droplets.
watering a little every day encourages lots of surface roots and the plants never really get enough moisture.
if only the soil surface is wet, it will soon dry out and the plant roots, where the water is best absorbed, will have received little or no moisture.
collecting rainwater rainwater, free of chlorine and other chemicals used in treating mains supply water, is the choice of many for use in watering pot plants, seedlings and tricky, fussy plants.
