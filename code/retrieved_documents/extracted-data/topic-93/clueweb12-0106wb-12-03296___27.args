since they don't like the cold, i don't think they would like it if you watered with cool water.
because the plants should be kept cool for much of the time during their dormancy, it is best to allow the growing medium to become almost dry before watering again.
you might want to try repotting into new, clean media and water with distilled water only for a month or so to see if the plants recover.
seed kits aren't very good to try for a first timer.
but i think the admins could be saved a lot of annoyance and frustration by disabling the comment feature, since people obviously don't get that it's for commenting, not questions.
because it's summer time i of course keep my door and windows wide open, but i usually do not see any flies or bugs in my appartment - will it die without food?
i've had it for a decent 4 months and it seems to be doing really well up to now.
yes, you can use shallower pots.
it is especially important during theirdormancy to avoid wet conditions when it is very cool or cold at the same time.
hi there, just got my seeds, i've put the pot of soil (correct soil i was given with the seeds) in a tray of rain water untill the top soil is wet / damp, now it's time to put the seeds in!
although higher levels of tds can be tolerated (up to 100 ppm (parts per million)) or so, in that case the growing medium would need to be flushed occasionally by watering several times over a period of several hours or perhaps a day, and the plants may benefit from repotting (changing the growing medium) once per year or so.
:> ... written by joe, june 01, 2011 okay everybody, distilled water costs a dollar a gallon, and rain water is free.
the comment sections on the pages are really for comments, not questions.
any tips would be appreciated very helpful site by the way re: terrarium - do i need to water it at all?
otherwise, if the plant and growing medium can be monitored, it is best to water and then allow the medium to dry until just moist before watering again.
i'm a first time owner of my venus fly trap, and i can't thank you enough for all the info.
mostmedia (soil) that venus fly traps are potted in is very good at retaining water.
if you live in a similar area and use rain water or your vft's stay outside.
however, the tray method is often not a good method to use all the time (see the paragraph above).
in any case, your seeds might need longer to germinate, or they might never germinate.
although higher levels of tds can be tolerated (up to 100 ppm (parts per million)) or so, in that case the growing medium would need to be flushed occasionally by watering several times over a period of several hours or perhaps a day, and the plants may benefit from repotting (changing the growing medium) once per year or so.
however regarding tap or well water, if one measures the water with a tds (total dissolved solids) meter which indicates a tds measurement of less than 50 ppm (parts per million), it is safe to use for venus flytraps and other carnivorous plants.
one way to water a venus flytrap is the tray method.
otherwise, if the plant and growing medium can be monitored, it is best to water and then allow the medium to dry until just moist before watering again.
if you are sure that it is clean, then it could be something else.
the tray method works well when plants are actively growing, are in lots of direct sunlight, and the weather is warm, or during vacations when one is not able to check one's plants.
the media will soak up water from a tray or bowl almost like a sponge.
food written by danny, april 23, 2010 myplant can never catch food by itself i put it next to a plant with 10 flies on it the flys stare at it and then just leave never get on the plant or even on the pot.i have to catch food myself.but 1 more thing were the flies are and my plant is there is shade.doese that affect anything?i still put it in full sunlight for at least 11 hours doese sunlight produce the nectar or what?
... written by johnny, july 15, 2009 i have recently started growing fly traps from seed and have been using sterilized water to water them!
i noticed the first trap i got was starting to get little wrinkles and now one part of it has a very subtle tinge of light brown i noticed.
i live in a area with lots of air pollution including an petrochemical plant.
watering help written by terrence, september 03, 2008 is arrowhead water safe enough for the plant re: watering help written by matt, september 04, 2008 arrowhead water will likely not be safe.
hopefully these 2 plants will survive as my first attempt ended in death i think it was a combo of bad light & bad water.
larger pots allow for more mistakes, and beginners make mistakes, so i recommend a 4-6 inch pot.
its mineral free and has no solids.
everybody who asked about the different types of water are obviously unexperienced, so your plants are gonna die anyways.
mostmedia (soil) that venus fly traps are potted in is very good at retaining water.
it's possible to grow them in terrariums, but they are healthier and more robust if they are grown outside.
written by matt, february 12, 2009 scott, you'll find tons of information on this in the forum, but basically you just sprinkle the seeds on top of the peat moss and keep them very moist until they germinate then you put them in a sunny windowsill to continue growing.
there are tons of people hear that would love to hear about your plants.
standing water can be detrimental to the venus flytrap.
written by omg, may 09, 2010 i just happened to be browsing google on venus fly traps and came across this site which i found very helpful.
boiling the water increases the amount of dissolved solids by making the clean water evaporate.
jojo a 10 year old.. water written by akira, december 21, 2009 hi there i have just brought pure dew water from the super market.
anywho, thank you very much for all the articles and a forum for questions.
the next step was to put it in direct sunlight.
it is especially important during theirdormancy to avoid wet conditions when it is very cool or cold at the same time.
the growing medium ideally should be just moist, not soggy or waterlogged.
if you repotted your vft in fertilized soil, it will burn the roots.
the dissolved solids that are in tap water - namely sodium, calcium, alkaline salts, sulfur, chlorine and magnesium - are detrimental to the health of your dionaea.
re: pur water written by matt, april 20, 2009 filtered water usually won't do.
thanks written by oddball, february 09, 2010 this site is great.
the time you spent on here asking about other types of water you could have spent getting the water recommended by every carnivorous plant website on the internet.
it's completely damp and sealed inside a plastic bag.
venus fly traps and all other carnivorous plants should only be watered with distilled water, rain water, reverse osmosis water (from an ro system).
trim off the traps that die.
i use distilled water.
however regarding tap or well water, if one measures the water with a tds (total dissolved solids) meter which indicates a tds measurement of less than 50 ppm (parts per million), it is safe to use for venus flytraps and other carnivorous plants.
re: snow! written by matt, february 06, 2009 yep, clean snow will work great for your flytrap!
therefore the tray method (described and pictured below) is best used only while the plants are in direct sunlight in hot weather, or when one goes on vacation to ensure that the medium does not dry completely.
for questions, you'll get better responses if you ask them in the forum.
it is best to let the water disapear for a little bit before adding water to the tray, as long as they don't dry out.
you have helped me and other beginner fly trap owners how to care for our plants keep up the good work

vft are tropical, so they would naturally like a warm environment, ... written by hayden, june 14, 2010 janene.
however, the tray method is often not a good method to use all the time (see the paragraph above).
distilled, rain, or ro water only-at least untill you gain experience :-).
the seeds have usually set on the shelf for too long and aren't viable any longer.
i realy dont want it to die thanks all xx water written by ..., august 07, 2010 can i put some tap water dechlorinator (i.e. for aquariums) in some ordinary tap water for my plant?
venus fly traps don't usually make very good terrarium pets.
it could be the water.
too much water kills.
they are prone to rot (as [matt] you probably know).
so as it said, i put the seeds in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for 3 weeks and then planted them in a pot with a sand/acidic soil mixture.
i currently put in a cap's measurement (the cap from the arrowhead bottle) of arrowhead before reading the information on the website.
any type of ground water will usually have a lot of dissolved solids in it, which can accumulate in the media and poison your plant.
in general, tap water is not a good idea.
written by matt, january 08, 2009 unfortunately no tom, well water isn't ok for venus fly traps.
the tray method works well when plants are actively growing, are in lots of direct sunlight, and the weather is warm, or during vacations when one is not able to check one's plants.
i want to know if it is ok to put it in the fridge for the plant.
bottom watering is the preferred method.
my little vft's are now 2 years old thanks to the wealth of information and advice from here, and the forum.
i couldn't help but laugh though after seeing the request to post questions in the forum and the very next post would be another question!
... written by sagal, april 06, 2009 i have noticed that alot of people's pictures are using really deap pots, since the roots dont go that deep is it ok to use shallower pots or would that be bad?
venus fly traps and all other carnivorous plants should only be watered with distilled water, rain water, reverse osmosis water (from an ro system).
re: a venus fly trap owner written by matt, december 10, 2008 karen, i'm glad to hear that you found the website helpful.
although it may not be immediately apparent with a few waterings, over time, the dissolved solids will begin to build up in the soil and can lead to a sickly looking plant and eventually death of the plant.
if you feed it never ever give it anything it could not catch itself in the swamp.
yes, if you are talking about using the water from the freezer, that should be fine to use.
my town has no public water source whatsoever.
overwatering often leads to sudden death; therefore it is best to keep the soil moist, but never wet.
i'd love to hear updates on your progress.
this cleared up a lot of things and probably prevented me from doing something that would've killed my vft.

i live in an appartment and will likely keep it inside.
it is very humid and its summer all year round.
sincerely the one who's a first timer at this and really needs information about venus fly traps.
quick answers to your questions: 1) some people top water their plants, but usually misting doesn't do much.
avoid collecting water from at least the firs 3-4 downpours since this rain is usually very acidic and contains high amounts of solids.

hi!my mom just recently bought me a venus fly trap,it has caought to flys already,but incase it can't is there any other food we could feed it?i heard you could give it hamburger meat
don't expect your first attempt at raising a fly trap to work out they are picky plants and it take a bit of time to get used to them!
... written by joyce, november 27, 2010 i bought 2 traps the other day & didn't realise you shouldn't give them tap water.
just a thing to all the food question people - it isnt needed for a flytrap, aslong as you result to the sun, water and soil.

i watered my first trap with chlorine water for a week or two but when i got two new flytraps i started watering with rain water i collected.
i doubt boiling normal tap water works.

if 1/2 of the fly i fed it yesterday and it had half of the bug sticking out.
my plant is kept on the windowpane right above the radiator.
a venus fly trap owner written by karen hobbs, december 09, 2008 great site, very helpful.
really, just don't use tap water.
water written by pirahnaplant001, december 17, 2010 ive seen people use fish bowls and mist them instead of having them constantly soak in the water.
2) no, boiled tap water is actually worse for your plants than regular tap water.
sometimes this means watering only 2-3 times per month during the growing season, depending on weather, humidity and the size of the pot the plant is growing in (larger pots often retain water for a longer period).
the importance of clean water for venus fly traps written by matt sunday, 30 march 2008 13:34 using pure water is essential to the health of a venus fly trap.
you will definitely still have to water them.

during their active growing season, venus flytraps should be monitored, especially during hot and dry weather, to ensure that their growing medium does not dry out completely.
the media will soak up water from a tray or bowl almost like a sponge.
water now written by lap, april 11, 2009 wich one is more haelthyer to use hot or cold water on the venus-flytrap.
they don't need bugs just make sure you give it lots of sun and always keep the soil damp not wet or dry.
the six inchers can accomodate even the most mature flytraps.
venus flytraps come from the bogs of america, so are used to all sorts of weather!
the growing medium ideally should be just moist, not soggy or waterlogged.
i live in munich so its pretty cold.
great job matt, and happy growing for the rest of you.
no water should be vissible if you happen to press on the soil.
i am a beginner and dont know anyhting about them.
no germination visable written by dan, february 28, 2009 i bought a venus fly trap seed kit sometime in january and it told me to prepare the seeds by imitating a dormancy period first.
although it may not be immediately apparent with a few waterings, over time, the dissolved solids will begin to build up in the soil and can lead to a sickly looking plant and eventually death of the plant.
but i am unsure,also whe watering the plant,can you use spring water?please let me know,thanks.
to find out why, and because as the bright red type says, this area is for comments only not questions, join the flytrapcare forum!
no jk i'm not that freaky about plants.
because the plants should be kept cool for much of the time during their dormancy, it is best to allow the growing medium to become almost dry before watering again.
therefore the tray method (described and pictured below) is best used only while the plants are in direct sunlight in hot weather, or when one goes on vacation to ensure that the medium does not dry completely.
sometimes this means watering only 2-3 times per month during the growing season, depending on weather, humidity and the size of the pot the plant is growing in (larger pots often retain water for a longer period).
so keeping the plant and medium "moist, not wet" most of the time is a good general rule, and it should be less moist most of the time during its dormancy when the air is cool to cold.
cool water written by devile15, may 20, 2010 i bought a 4l distilled water and put it in the fridge.
quick answer - your venus flytrap will be fine if it never eats a bug in its entire life.
during their active growing season, venus flytraps should be monitored, especially during hot and dry weather, to ensure that their growing medium does not dry out completely.
they will die if left outside.
below you will see a photo of the tray method which involves setting a pot with drainage holes in the bottom of it in a tray of distilled or other pure water.
in general, tap water is not a good idea.

it says they use a combination of steam distilling, ro, filtration and ozonation.
