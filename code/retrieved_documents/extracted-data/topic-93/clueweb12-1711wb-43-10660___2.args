desert plants, such as agave, form concave appendages to capture rain drops and direct the water towards the root zone.
the various alternate water sources are collected in the cistern, and often filtered and sanitized for use in flushing urinals and toilets throughout the building.

rain barrel systems can be a great way to harvest rain water to supplement irrigation needs.
capturing the full 624 gallons (2.4 m3) requires more than 12 rain barrels.
capturing all of the rainwater requires the resident to attach rain barrels at every downspout.
each rain barrel will store only 50 to 60 gallons (189.2 l to 227.1 l) of water.
the typical cistern storage capacity ranges from 500 to 10,000 gallons per cistern (1.9 m3 to 37.8 m3) ; although multiple cisterns are often interconnected in large building sites.
in general, larger rainwater storage systems will often be more cost effective than rain barrels if the water is to be used beyong local landscape irrigation.
in rural areas, the advances in well drilling technology allows for deeper wells, where groundwater levels seldom fall below well depth.
parking lot and roadway surfaces are coated in motor oil, antifreeze, exhaust soot, and other automobile fluids.
new inventive designs are using corrugated steel bins (originally fabricated for grain storage) with a plastic liner to create a water vessel.

the problem is the barrels are filled when it rains; a time the landscape probably does not need additional water.
the barrels also have an overflow spout and hose to divert excess water away from the home’s foundation.
cisterns come in all shapes and sizes.
it has also been observed that residents of home cisterns tend to be more tolerant of their own cistern water quality than visitors that imbibe in the cistern water..

rain barrel systems can be a great way to harvest rain water to supplement irrigation needs.
in typical us cities, where 50% of the landscape is paved over, a 1 inch rain event produces more than 150 million gallons (567,811.8 m3) of stormwater per square mile.

to properly evaluate its application and benefits, one must consider the frequency of local rain events that occur during the irrigation season.
managing stormwater in urban environments has reached near crises levels in some us cities as urban sprawl grows and landscapes are paved over with non-porous materials (concrete and asphalt).
the quality of stormwater varies greatly from different sites; the water quality determines the appropriate uses, or if water treatment is needed before the water is utilized.
while it is true that the rainwater can be used to flush toilets, the added cost of equipment to convey the water to the toilets might hamper overall cost effectiveness; one barrel of water is unlikely to supply more than 3 days worth of flushing water for the typical home.
