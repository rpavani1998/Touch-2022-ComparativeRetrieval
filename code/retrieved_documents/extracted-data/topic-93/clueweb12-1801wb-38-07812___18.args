dr. marc gorelick, chief of pediatric emergency medicine at the medical college of wisconsin, led a group of researchers that studied the incidence of illnesses following rainfall.
in the one of most comprehensive analyses of public drinking water utilities available, the non-profit environmental working group ranked performance and safety of the utility and water supplies in america’s big cities (250,000 or more inhabitants).
while these are qualitywater filters, they do lack some filtration capabilities, and their yearly costs are significantly higher than a basic berkey water filter.
here we show the study results in map form for arsenic: arsenic well contamination levels
whether it be our well water that is being affected by general pollution, or our municipal water that is being heavily treated with disinfectants, our water is not as pure and pristine as we would hope.
even in communities with state of the art treatment facilities, the infrastructure that connects these facilities to homes, businesses, and schools is often in dire need of repair and maintenance.
through a short procedure, this handy machine will provide you with clean purified water as well as saving you from the costs of potential sicknesses caused by unwanted chemicals and contamination.
he covers filters representative of top consumer brands such as pur, aquasana, and reverse osmosis.
according to the epa website on the dangers of arsenic,  ” non-cancer effects can include thickening and discoloration of the skin, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting; diarrhea; numbness in hands and feet; partial paralysis; and blindness.
when the right system is selected, you will enjoy cleaner, safer water without having to spend a fortune in the process.
our water filters remove the things in your water that you don’t want without stripping out the vital minerals your body needs.
the 2010 report card recently released by the american society of civil engineers gave pennsylvania’s water and waste water management systems failing grades.
meanwhile, as this gets worked out, the risks to your health ever increase without a home water filter.
corrosion of distribution system pipes can reduce water flow.”
the answer to that mystery likely lies in an aging infrastructure of pipes used to transport water.
unsavory chemicals like chlorine, unwanted additives like fluoride, and a host of microscopic bacteria can seep into every glass.
berkey water filter systems also significantly reduce the fluoride and arsenic levels in your water via the pf line of filters.
radon gas decays into radioactive particles that can get trapped in your lungs when you breathe it.. ..radon in indoor air is the second leading cause of lung cancer.”
these great machines have been tested and proven to eliminate water borne bacteria that can cause various ailments.
even when the berkey secondary fluoride filters are added on, the black berkey / pf-2 combination is still cheaper.
the problem is further complicated by limited taxpayer dollars set to the backdrop of towns and states facing major budget shortfalls.
these great machines have been tested and proven to eliminate water borne bacteria that can cause various ailments.
the study concluded that the incidence of waterborne illnesses occur more frequently even after comparatively mild rain events.
the findings certainly underscore the message we hear from the public health agencies, that everyone should test their wells for a suite of trace elements.
conversely, berkey systems have an add-on filter option for theblack berkey filter elements called the pf-2 filter that specifically targets both fluoride and arsenic to reduce it by over 99.75%.
home water filters comparison given this is only a 7 minute segment, dr oz is unable to explore in detail some of the other water filtration solutions on the market.
for the first time a national study has been conducted testing for potential trace contaminants in wells and aquifers.

extreme rainfall can deluge sewage systems, especially those systems that are called upon to manage both waste water and storm water runoff.
in pittsburgh for example, officials are debating over how to fund needed updates to both their water treatment facilities and maintenance of sewer lines which were installed in 1912.
basically, the longer the water has been in contact with the aquifer, the more chemically evolved it is deemed to be and thus the greater concentrations of these trace minerals, some of which are harmful to the body such as arsenic and radon.
these were not isolated to a couple regions, but rather found to be persistent nationwide stating, “wells with human health benchmark exceedances were widespread across the united states; they occurred in all aquifer groups and in both humid and dry regions.”
