the simplest method of testing the moisture content in the soil is by rolling a little bit of soil in your hand.
if you have heavy falls of rain you will need to install a system of dry streambeds (also called 'swales'), drains filled with gravel or sump holes to move water quickly and safely away from the house and border.
watering with a strong force of water, or with large droplets, results in a crusty layer forming on the top of the soil.
don't expect the surface to be moist all of the time.
the simplest method of testing the moisture content in the soil is by rolling a little bit of soil in your hand.
in very bright sunny weather, the water can actually scorch the plants, as the sun reflects on the water droplets.
watering systems traditional watering methods are wasteful of water and can cause other problems in especially dry climates.
next page compost a late winter or spring compost mulch will not only reduce water loss through evaporation in the garden, it will improve soil structure, help water conservation in the soil and drainage.
even a large bucket left out on the terrace or outside the potting shed will fill with rainwater.
trees and shrubs are more deeply rooted and need the water to penetrate further.

keeping rainfall records, or checking the local paper, will tell you whether a shower wet or merely dampened the soil.
water wise watering the garden may sound simple, but different requirements require different solutions.
we keep saying it, but compost is truly at the heart of the garden.
collecting rainwater rainwater, free of chlorine and other chemicals used in treating mains supply water, is the choice of many for use in watering pot plants, seedlings and tricky, fussy plants.
watering a little every day encourages lots of surface roots and the plants never really get enough moisture.

good looking traditional or modern rain butts are available for specialist merchants.
but water is the lifeblood of the garden and essential for good plant growth.
you want to water the roots, rather than the leaves and certainly not have the water evaporate in the air before the plants can get to it.
much of the water you applied will be of no benefit to the plants.

watering with a strong force of water, or with large droplets, results in a crusty layer forming on the top of the soil.
as a rule 25mm (1 inch) of water is enough to penetrate the soil to a depth of 12-15cm (approx 1 foot) and that is sufficient for most grasses, ground covers and perennials.
