water in which the vegetables & fruits have been washed - use to water the flowers & plants.
â€¢ as rwh - neither energy-intensive nor labour-intensive â€¢ it can be a cost-effective alternative to other water-accruing methods.
in saline or coastal areas & islands, rain water provides good quality water city/town summary population  3,64,523 (as per 2001 census) area  68.63  sq.
rain water harvesting water conservation â€¢ important step for solutions to issues of water and environmental conservation is to change people's attitudes and habits â€¢ conserve water because it is right thing to do!.
â€¢ rain water harvesting rwh- process of collecting, conveying & storing water from rainfall in an area â€“ for beneficial use.
â€¢ use a washing machine that does not consume too much water.
â€¢ install small shower heads to reduce the flow of the water.
see that there are no leaking taps.
â€¢ storage â€“ in tanks, reservoirs, underground storage- groundwater â€¢ hydrological cycle â€¢ rwh - yield copious amounts of water.
â€¢ with the water table falling rapidly, & concrete surfaces and landfill dumps taking the place of water bodies, rwh is the most reliable solution for augmenting groundwater level to attain self-sufficiency rwh â€“ methodologies â€¢ roof rain water harvesting â€¢ land based rain water harvesting â€¢ watershed based rain water harvesting â€¢ for urban & industrial environment â€“ â€¢ roof & land based rwh â€¢ public, private, office & industrial buildings â€¢ pavements, lawns, gardens & other open spaces rain water harvestingâ€“ advantages 1.provides self-sufficiency to water supply 2.reduces the cost for pumping of ground water 3.provides high quality water, soft and low in minerals 4.improves the quality of ground water through dilution when recharged 5.reduces soil erosion & flooding in urban areas 6.the rooftop rain water harvesting is less expensive & easy to construct, operate and maintain 7.
for an average rainfall of 1,000mm, approximately four million litres of rainwater can be collected in a year in an acre of land (4,047 m2), post-evaporation.
while brushing or other use, do not leave the tap running, open it only when you require it.
â€¢ at the end of the day if you have water left in your water bottle do not throw it away, pour it over some plants.
