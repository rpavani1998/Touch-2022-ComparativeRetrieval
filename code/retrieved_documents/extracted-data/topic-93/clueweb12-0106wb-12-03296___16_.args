during their active growing season, venus flytraps should be monitored, especially during hot and dry weather, to ensure that their growing medium does not dry out completely.standing water can be detrimental to the venus flytrap.overwatering often leads to sudden death; therefore it is best to keep the soil moist, but never wet.the dissolved solids that are in tap water - namely sodium, calcium, alkaline salts, sulfur, chlorine and magnesium - are detrimental to the health of your dionaea.sometimes this means watering only 2-3 times per month during the growing season, depending on weather, humidity and the size of the pot the plant is growing in (larger pots often retain water for a longer period).because the plants should be kept cool for much of the time during their dormancy, it is best to allow the growing medium to become almost dry before watering again.although higher levels of tds can be tolerated (up to 100 ppm (parts per million)) or so, in that case the growing medium would need to be flushed occasionally by watering several times over a period of several hours or perhaps a day, and the plants may benefit from repotting (changing the growing medium) once per year or so.any type of ground water will usually have a lot of dissolved solids in it, which can accumulate in the media and poison your plant.it's possible to grow them in terrariums, but they are healthier and more robust if they are grown outside.boiling the water increases the amount of dissolved solids by making the clean water evaporate.however regarding tap or well water, if one measures the water with a tds (total dissolved solids) meter which indicates a tds measurement of less than 50 ppm (parts per million), it is safe to use for venus flytraps and other carnivorous plants.venus fly traps and all other carnivorous plants should only be watered with distilled water, rain water, reverse osmosis water (from an ro system).otherwise, if the plant and growing medium can be monitored, it is best to water and then allow the medium to dry until just moist before watering again.the tray method works well when plants are actively growing, are in lots of direct sunlight, and the weather is warm, or during vacations when one is not able to check one's plants.the importance of clean water for venus fly traps written by matt sunday, 30 march 2008 13:34 using pure water is essential to the health of a venus fly trap.
