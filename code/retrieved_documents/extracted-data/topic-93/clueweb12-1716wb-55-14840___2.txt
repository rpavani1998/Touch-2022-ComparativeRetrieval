most of the water we use is embedded in the food we eat, and the products we buy:producing 1 kilo of beef for example consumes 15,000 litres of water while 1 kilo of wheat ’drinks up’ 1,500 litres.
in the greenhouse, we have water butts  thatuse rain water from our gutters for watering plants and  for feeding the loos and hand basins.
this  means it is really important to buy seasonal, local and unprocessed food to  minimise our water use.

( http://www.unwater.org/worldwaterday/).
at home, you can put a full bottle of water or a ‘hippo’  in your toilet cistern to reduce the amount of water (processed to drinking  standards) that is needed to fill it and which gets literally flushed down the  drain needlessly.
coping with population growth and ensuring access to nutritious food to everyone call for a series of actions we can all help by: - following a healthier, sustainable diet - consuming less water-intensive products - reducing the scandalous food wastage: 30% of the food produced worldwide is never eaten - producing more food, of better quality, with less water.
there are some information leaflets on the right hand side of the website front page that will give you more ideas for saving water at home.

a very dry winter means that ground water supplies, which most of us rely on for our drinking water, have not been replenished leaving us with the very real prospect of running short.
in the greenhouse, we have water butts thatuse rain water from our gutters for watering plants and for feeding the loos and hand basins.
the toilets are ‘dual flush’  so that they use less water when you only do a wee.
water is a critically important resource, and recent news stories have really started to emphasise how carefully we need to look after it.

when a billion people in the world already live in chronic hunger and water resources are under pressure we should not pretend the problem is ‘elsewhere’.
please take a look at the website you’ll be surprised by some of the  facts, and whilst you think about what you can do, please take a moment to pass  the information on.
and don’t be fooled by the recent rain – the national farmers’ union say that‘several months’ of steady rainfall is needed to relieve drought conditions.
