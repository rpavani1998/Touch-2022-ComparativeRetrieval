if all the rooftops in 13 metro atlanta counties were used to collect rainwater, more than 300 million gallons of water per day could be harvested.
rainwater harvesting: mcdonough’s mark brown, founder of rain catchers http://daemonpictures.com three years ago georgia was wilting in the arid throes of a record drought, the worst in more than a century.
already, institutions like the university of georgia, emory and georgia tech are saving millions of gallons of municipal drinking water through the use of rainwater harvesting systems for non-potable uses.
the credits, however, are dependent entirely on federal stimulus money – which may or may not be available to fund state tax credits.
“when it’ll happen, who can say, but i believe it will have a future here in georgia, in the coastal region.
so, capturing the freest source of water known – rain – was barely mentioned in the stewardship act, but the legislature also passed house bill 1069, a complicated piece of omnibus legislation that includes, among other things, up to $2,500 in state income tax credits for people who install rainwater harvesting (or catchment) systems.
using rainwater from the roof is simple.
but koros, who tries to remain optimistic in the face of it all, says we have the technology and the ingenuity to do better.
the timing definitely seemed right, with the drought and the water wars between georgia, florida and alabama,” browning says.
but first they were going to build a $1-million demonstration plant capable of producing more than 25,000 gallons a day.
if all the rooftops in 13 metro atlanta counties were used to collect rainwater, more than 300 million gallons of water per day could be harvested.
“desalination, interbasin transfers, new reservoirs all require a lot of infrastructure, pumps, the acquisition of land, and it takes years for those things to become productive.
“if we could just take this seriously long enough, we can get far ahead of everybody and start getting more efficient right now, and the rest of the world can catch on.
“it takes a lot less energy to clean up water for reuse than it does for desalination.
and while it is expensive (when compared to drawing water from lakes, rivers and aquifers), the cost – in terms of dollars and energy – is coming down somewhat.
agl resources was in on the deal, they were gonna give right of way for pipes from down here up to atlanta.”
scorching heat, record-low rainfalls in historically wet regions and shrinking water supplies pushed most of the southeast to the brink of dehydration while georgia was engaged in a pitched battle with florida and alabama over water rights to lake lanier.
“because when you have a drought, people are wringing their hands, saying to themselves, ‘this is serious.’
• tuscon, ariz., now requires new commercial construction to include a plan in which at least 50 percent of landscape irrigation uses rainwater harvesting.
but first they were going to build a $1-million demonstration plant capable of producing more than 25,000 gallons a day.
there are cheaper, more efficient ways to generate new sources of water.
the need for water is automatic, not something traditionally perceived consciously as we blissfully let the tap run while brushing our teeth, unaware that all the water that ever was is all there is, that less than one percent of it is available to meet our needs, that the global population will reach nine billion before very long
the engineering firm, which has done desalination projects all over the world, was working with aquasis.
but koros, who tries to remain optimistic in the face of it all, says we have the technology and the ingenuity to do better.
in arid regions like the middle east (which uses about 70 percent of the current worldwide capacity), desalination is widely employed because it is the most viable source of fresh water.
“right now there are some big ‘ifs’ regarding that program, but it passed easily and it’s a positive direction,” says brown, who produces a rain harvesting blog (www.thecistern.com).
for the shortsighted and absentminded, the water problem was solved.
howard browning could see the pattern and the opportunity it presented.
eddie van giesen is well aware of that, and he’s tried to spread the message to state lawmakers as a registered lobbyist and policy director for brae rainwater technologies that rainwater harvesting could close the water gap in metro atlanta.
crosby, who could not be reached for this story, told georgia trend in spring 2007 that the company was mainly focused on serving coastal communities, but a pipeline to atlanta wasn’t out of the question.

we haven’t figured out yet how to increase the rainfall, nor have we figured out how to increase the attention span of the tap-turning populace.
you can’t distribute all of that water, now with a higher concentration of salt, in one spot or you run the risk of killing aquatic life.”
“rainwater collection went from barely being mentioned to written legislation for tax rebates.
and according to a recent report in national geographic magazine, new desalination plants may add about 13 billion gallons a day to the global potable water supply within the next six years.

in 2009 it started raining again, and lake levels returned to near normal.
“using a technically complex and expensive system to address a common sense problem just seems like putting the cart ahead of the horse,” says deborah sheppard, executive director of the altamaha river-keeper.
but the state is growing faster than water can accumulate, so environmental advocates, entrepreneurs and leaders from business and government are seeking solutions and considering different and varied options, including one that relies totally on rain and its storage, to meet georgia’s water supply challenge.
you hope that the judge will give us more time, but this bill gives us measures that will help us in the future,” says state rep. lynn smith (r-newnan), who chairs the house natural resources and environment committee.
for environmental advocates, desalination, with its energy cost (and the use of fresh water to generate the electricity), just doesn’t make sense.

the long-range plan was to pipe water from the coast uphill to atlanta, about 250 miles.
if every one of the estimated 85 big-box retailers (home depot, walmart, etc.) in a 10-county metro atlanta region collected rainwater, it would yield about 700,000 gallons of water a day.
he believes perception is growing, and that might be our species’ saving grace.
“i absolutely think we have desalination in our future,” she says.
“the biggest enemy of conservation is rain,” quips william j. koros, chemical and biomolecular engineering professor at georgia tech.
it’s expensive, but the cost of desalination has fallen by about 80 percent over the last decade, according to jeff fulgham, chief sustainability officer of ge power and water.

georgia law only permits non-potable use for rainwater catchment systems (irrigation, flushing toilets, laundry, building and vehicle washing, fire suppression, etc.), though advanced filtration systems can clean and purify water to levels that exceed the quality of municipal systems.
“i guess we were kind of disappointed, because nobody seemed willing to look outside of the box,” says mark brown, founder of rain catchers, a mcdonough-based firm that designs and builds rainwater harvesting systems.
georgia experienced record-high average temperatures over the summer and much of the state experienced drought conditions, and the probability for another drought is high for 2011.

“rain is a cyclical thing, and after it rains people stop recognizing the fact that the water situation isn’t getting any better,” koros says.
this would be terrible timing because unless georgia can strike a deal with alabama and florida by july 2012, lake lanier will be off limits as a source of drinking water, meaning four million area residents will be facing a 280-million-gallon-a-day deficit – all of this because in july 2009 u.s. district court judge paul magnuson ruled that atlanta’s withdrawals from lanier were illegal since the lake was built to generate electricity, not supply drinking water.

these are typically underground cisterns, and often quite large, like the 16,000-gallon system brown’s firm installed at the goddard school in buford, or the 35,000-gallon system he designed for a hospital in brunswick.
“you can increase supply by reducing demand – that’s the low-hanging fruit, and i’m not convinced georgia has done everything it can to reduce demand,” fulgham says.
