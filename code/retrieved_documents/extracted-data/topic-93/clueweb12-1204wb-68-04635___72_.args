plant growth, whether deliberate or accidental, can in some circumstances protect buildings, and in other circumstances damage them the presence of plants can reduce the rate of drying, block ventilation holes, further the accumulation of debris, lead to the raising of external ground levels, and provide protection and cover for animal pests of all types.at best, these insects are a serious nuisance, and several species are vectors for a number of diseases with climatic warming, increasing frequency of overseas travel, and decreasing effectiveness of both anti-malarial drugs and insecticides, the importance of eliminating breeding sites for mosquitoes cannot be over-stressed.a higher standard of expertise appears to be expected from knowledgeable and well funded bodies such as the national trust, than is expected of private individuals landowners are liable for injuries caused by defective trees to persons entitled to access to the land.this disruption of drainage and the resultant water penetration is especially damaging in unoccupied buildings where problems are less likely to be detected before major damage has been done.while plants can damage buildings, or more often, exacerbate the effects of building defects or poor maintenance, they can also protect.this is most significant in the provision of food, and in giving protection from human predation.plants, especially trees, growing in the vicinity of buildings may also have adverse effects disturbance of ground water by trees, fire risk, lightning hazards and physical damage, especially in relation to storm damage landowners are obliged to cut back plant growth where it interferes with the safe passage of vehicles or pedestrians when plants are growing over neighbouring properties, the owners of the neighbouring properties are entitled to cut back the plants at the boundary line, regardless of whether (in the case of trees) this is compatible with good arboricultural practice landowners are responsible for any damage caused by plants growing within their property, eg trees falling onto neighbouring highways or properties where the public has right of access, or a poisonous plant grows over the boundary, landowners are responsible for its effects.contact poisons, poison baiting, and fumigation result in animals dying in inaccessible locations where their corpses will putrefy and attract insect pests.their faeces provide an ideal environment for the growth of the organisms causing such diseases as histoplasmosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcis and listeriosis.careful management of plant growth not only enhances the aesthetic benfits of the plants, but also reduces or removes most of the associated problems plants, building users and building owners plants can improve the appearance of a building, and the local microclimate, but plant growth has structural and legal implications for building owners and landowners structural considerations buildings can provide plants with support, or a place to grow undisturbed.trapping has the advantage that it prevents the rodent from dying in an inaccessible location where it will produce a foul smell and attract insect pests.the bodies of the animals remain in inaccesible locations, where their decay is likely to cause health problems.click on one of the headings below to go to the relevant headings on the detailed contents list: buildings provide warm, sheltered, and occasionally moist environment for a variety of living organisms.plants, especially trees, growing in the vicinity of buildings may also have adverse effects disturbance of ground water by trees, fire risk, lightning hazards and physical damage, especially in relation to storm damage plant growth over boundaries landowners are obliged to cut back plant growth where it interferes with the safe passage of vehicles or pedestrians when plants are growing over neighbouring properties, the owners of the neighbouring properties are entitled to cut back the plants at the boundary line, regardless of whether (in the case of trees) this is compatible with good arboricultural practice landowners are responsible for any damage caused by plants growing within their property, eg trees falling onto neighbouring highways or properties poisonous plants where the public has right of access, or a poisonous plant grows over the boundary, landowners are responsible for its effects.this is particularly so when large accumulations of filth build up inside a building they are commonly carriers of a number of serious human diseases including salmonellosis, psiticosis and pseudo-tuberculosis.
