well water is normally drawn from ground water which seeps down the soil from rainfall.further, we have found that the runoff is very much diluted relative to pure rain water so most of the reservoir water that comes from runoff is already diluted from soil filtering.we have found that the soil and rocks are an extremely good filter for these nuclidesand i expect ground water supplies would have less contamination than just rain water run off.the source is the reservoir has a dilution factor based on how much water inventory was there before the event and how much contaminated rain fell in the immediate area.however, tap water is (e.g. from east bay mud) is normally pulled from the bottoms of large reservoirs in the sierra (this is not always the case) and travel through closed aqueducts to a treatment facility then pumped to tanks that feed the tap supply.my well has a complicated filtration system on it itself as well for filtering out iron and other things, so i'm hoping all these things together (soil, well filter, brita filter) are giving me water that's at least as safe as berkeley tap water, which at last check is showing no detectable levels.so i'm gathering my well water is pretty safe to drink considering the filtration that takes place as the rainwater travels thru the soil, rocks, etc.we did do a radon test in the house inspection and the readings were average for the region.i've read that for radiation carbon filters like brita and pur can help but they're not as effective as reverse osmosis filters.i'm hoping that the soil filtration plus the brita water filter i'm using will be enough to keep it safe.despite the fact that the water passed the inspection test i just didn't feel comfortable drinking it.if you drink well water without ro + uv sanitizing you are making a huge mistake.that said, if the brawn team is interested in testing well water (and soil, too) from the sierra foothills, i'd be happy to provide samples.any other info anyone else can provide would be greatly appreciated.
