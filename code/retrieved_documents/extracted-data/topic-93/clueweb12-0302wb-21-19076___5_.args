it is a limited commodity and one that may become scarce in dry weather, so it is vital to understand the needs of plants and take steps to reduce water loss from them and from the soil.this kind of preparation enables the soil to hold on to water without becoming waterlogged, thus allowing rapid establishment of plants.many plants, native to these areas, can survive on very little moisture and most will grow well in dry areas with hot summers.water with soap and detergents is harmless to plants and can supplement rainwater, but not water with bleach.they will store enough food and water to ensure the plant has the energy to survive until the next rain.storage organs can help a plant survive the driest periods by collecting water at times of plenty.choosing the right plants plants that grow in mediterranean areas have developed distinctive types of foliage and storage systems, to minimise water loss or store water in periods of drought.for those parts of britain that can suffer from low rainfall and hot summers, strong, drying winds can cause plants to transpire (lose water through their leaves).adapting to climate change understanding plants' natural environments allows the gardener to provide the conditions in which the plants will give their best.their leaves' small surface area prevents excess water loss through evaporation and some will roll their leaves inwards, reducing the surface even more.the most valuable natural resource in a garden is water.all of this means that careful selection of plants is crucial to their success.24,000 litres of water (enough to fill 150 water butts) could be collected from the roof of a small house each year.water saving notes plants need most water in hot, dry weather - when water companies are least able to supply the demand.at peak times, up to 70% of household water may be used in gardens.
