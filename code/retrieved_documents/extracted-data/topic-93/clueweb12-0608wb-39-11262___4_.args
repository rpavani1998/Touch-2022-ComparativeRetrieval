allowing water to stand overnight may allow some volatile chemicals to evaporate, but most of the things that will kill your carnivorous plants will still remain.over time, these chemicals can kill your carnivorous plants or at the very least force you to repot more frequently because your planting medium is decomposing.you would also want to keep the still fairly isolated from its surroundings so it would not get contaminated by airborne dust, acid rain, dog pee, or anything else that would degrade your water quality.i think this method evolved from the aquarium trade, supposedly as a valid method to get chlorine out of municipal tap water before using it in a fish tank.the tap water or well water in most houses contains too many chemicals, including calcium.if you boil about 4 liters (1 gallon) of your tap water until it is completely gone, and see no white residue on the bottom of your pan, maybe you can use tapwater on your carnivorous plants!sphagnum moss did not survive well in his greenhouse, and dead sphagnum fiber seemed to break down faster than normal, but other than that his plants did great.utricularia inflata a: pure water is essential for your carnivorous plants, because that is what they are adapted to in their wetland habitats.3)use coffee or "brita" style pour-through filters i do not know what these things do exactly, but i have tried a few experiments and found that they do not stop the salts that would accumulate and eventually kill your plants.you are trying to remove ions from the water, not organisms.3)collect water from cooling units some people collect condensation water from their refrigerators.boiling may (may) drive off chlorine, but nothing else of importance.another person e-mailed me from the british moorlands to tell me that he gathered rainwater and it worked just fine.ways that may work pinguicula macroceras 1)getting water right out of the tap some people live in places where the tap water or well water is gloriously pure and unprocessed.the water for a while other than ensuring your plants will not get dysentery, this will not do anything.
