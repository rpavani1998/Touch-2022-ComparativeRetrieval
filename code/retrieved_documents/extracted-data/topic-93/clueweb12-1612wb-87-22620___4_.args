chlorine: one of the most common chemicals used in the treatment of public water supplies because it is highly effective in killing harmful microorganisms.this is the natural cycle of water, including evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation and percolation.potable water: water that is safe to drink after the raw water has gone through the filtration and treatment process.an older home containing lead pipes could contribute to increased lead levels in the home's tap water.after a period of rain, snow, sleet or hail, water will flow through soil and rock to reach underground aquifers.acid rain: rain water that has a lower ph (acidic) as a result of sulfur gases being released into the atmosphere from the burning of coal, gasoline and other fossil fuels.contamination can occur naturally or by the hands of humans.this is an area of land that allows rainwater to flow into creeks, streams and rivers.sometimes a reservoir will be open, like a man-made lake, or it may be a fully enclosed tank, either above-ground or underground.contaminant: any substance found in water that may be harmful to water consumers.back to top drought: a period of lower-than-normal precipitation that can lead to a water shortage.conservation: methods of using water wisely with the minimum amount of water being wasted.surface water: any source of water that is found on top of the earth's surface, such as a lake, river or stream.recharge area: an area of land that allows rainwater to percolate into the earth's surface to replenish groundwater sources.raw water: the water from a surface water or groundwater source prior to filtration or treatment.
