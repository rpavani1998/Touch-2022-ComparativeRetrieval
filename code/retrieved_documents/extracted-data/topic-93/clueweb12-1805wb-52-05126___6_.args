the results of this monitoring indicated that our cryptosporidium levels in both of our source waters are at low levels and that we do not need additional treatment to address the risk associated with these levels.as part of the safe drinking water act, the united states environmental protection agency (usepa) wants to make certain that every consumer of tap water in the usa has information on the water you are drinking.chloramines are not harmful and in fact are used by some utilities as the primary disinfectant.in spite of the low risk, as an extra precaution wssc is taking the most important steps in protecting against cryptosporidium, which include maintaining effective coagulation and filtration processes in our water treatment plants as well as adding uv disinfection equipment to both our water treatment plants.for example, dozens of samples per day are tested for bacteria, but some rare exotic pesticides are monitored merely quarterly.it, too, can be expected to contain trace amounts of some contaminants.the standards for bottled water are set by thefood and drug administration and it undergoes much less stringent testing than does tap water.translate this website to: as part of the safe drinking water act, the united states environmental protection agency (usepa) wants to make certain that every consumer of tap water in the usa has information on the water you are drinking.due to rain, ice and snowstorms, river conditions can produce strong bleachy odors and musty/earthy odors.currently, we are not routinely monitoring for cryptosporidium based on the fact that our risk appears low and because we are not required to do so, but we are planning for an additional two years of monitoring beginning in 2015 as required by epa.most of our customers receive their water from the potomac water filtration plant, and that water tends to be moderately hard.the odor is a result of the combination of the chlorine used to disinfect and ammonia in the runoff water (rain, melting snow and ice) producing chloramines.there are no adverse health affects from the odor.we also conducted some special monitoring during the same period researching sources of cryptosporidium within the potomac watershed, which we've used to help focus source protection programs we are working on with regional partners.frequency of analysis depends on the parameter or contaminant being measured.
