according to epa, common sources of drinking water pollution may be human-caused or naturally-occurring and include the following: naturally occurring human activities · microorganisms from wildlife and soils · radionuclides from underlying rock · nitrates and nitrites from nitrogen compounds in the soil · heavy metals from underground rocks containing o arsenic, o cadmium, o chromium, o lead, and o selenium · fluoride.

however, keeping facilities manned, maintained and up to date is not cheap and requires substantial taxpayer dollars.
extreme rainfall can deluge sewage systems, especially those systems that  are called upon to manage both waste water and storm water runoff.
the primary question we have to ask ourselves is: how have these concentrations gotten so high putting so many us citizens at risk, and how does one protect their family?there are two primary causes for these major well changes; natural chemical evolution / groundwater age, and pollution.
in pittsburgh for example, officials are debating over how to fund needed updates to both their water treatment facilities and maintenance of sewer lines which were installed in 1912.
basically, the longer the water has been in contact with the aquifer, the more chemically evolved it is deemed to be and thus the greater concentrations of these trace minerals, some of which are harmful to the body such as arsenic and radon.
these  were not isolated to a couple regions, but rather found to be persistent  nationwide stating, “wells with human health benchmark exceedances were  widespread across the united states; they occurred in all aquifer groups and in  both humid and dry regions.”
