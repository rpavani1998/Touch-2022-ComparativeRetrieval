“not only is using reclaimed water advantageous to businesses because it is cheaper than potable water, but it is also important because it increases a city’s ability to conserve water and therefore prolongs the life of the water resources.el paso leads the way thanks to water reclamation and conservation policies, the city of el paso has become a desert city with a sustainable water supply.“not only is using reclaimed water advantageous to businesses because it is cheaper than potable water, but it is also important because it increases a city’s ability to conserve water and therefore prolongs the life of the water resources.”through continued research, the center has produced several reports on effective uses of reclaimed water and landscape management.in essence, the system speeds up what would naturally occur with the flow of discharged water through wetlands with more pristine results, grant added.epwu maintains four wastewater reclamation plants, and each plant yields treated effluent for nonpotable use, suitable for customers to apply to parks, sports fields, landscape nurseries, golf courses, construction projects and many other situations.research conducted by the texas agrilife research center in el paso in close partnership with epwu has frequently provided scientific support for the reclaimed water program.according to epwu, since its water conservation ordinance was established in 1991, its conservation and reclaimed water programs havesaved 231 billion gallons of water, which is enough water to fill the sun bowl 6,392 times.some of the treated wastewater is used for industrial processes, and epwu recharges some of it back into the aquifer.from upstream to downstream, one city’s wastewater is eventually another city’s water supply.reclaiming water for drinking water starting next year, another west texas city will join the other municipalities taking advantage of reclaimed water resources.darden noted that big spring and crmwd had considered reclaimed water as an additional drinking water source for the area as far back as the 1980s, but the cost was prohibitive at that time.rojas noted the sustainability and benefits of el paso’s reclaimed water program.starting next year, another west texas city will join the other municipalities taking advantage of reclaimed water resources.in addition to four well fields, crmwd currently depends on three lakes for its water supply: e.v. spence reservoir, which is at less than 1 percent of its capacity; lake j.b. thomas, which is at about 2 percent of its capacity; and o.h. ivie reservoir, which is at about 20 percent of its capacity.
