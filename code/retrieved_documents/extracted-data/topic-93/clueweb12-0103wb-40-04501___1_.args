and, by watering a large area and not just the plants, spray irrigation can result in a burgeoning weed population, competing with your precious plants for water.watering systems traditional watering methods are wasteful of water and can cause other problems in especially dry climates.this is a barrier to subsequent watering or rain; it may prevent the essential exchange of air and gases.collecting rainwater rainwater, free of chlorine and other chemicals used in treating mains supply water, is the choice of many for use in watering pot plants, seedlings and tricky, fussy plants.but water is the lifeblood of the garden and essential for good plant growth.spray irrigation can simply erode precious topsoil as it drains away.trees and shrubs are more deeply rooted and need the water to penetrate further.light surface watering encourages the roots towards the surface where they are more vulnerable to dryness and heat, rather than deeper into the soil.if only the soil surface is wet, it will soon dry out and the plant roots, where the water is best absorbed, will have received little or no moisture.storing water water is a precious and expensive resource.in very bright sunny weather, the water can actually scorch the plants, as the sun reflects on the water droplets.as a rule 25mm (1 inch) of water is enough to penetrate the soil to a depth of 12-15cm (approx 1 foot) and that is sufficient for most grasses, ground covers and perennials.if you merely wet the surface of the soil it will quickly dry out again, leaving plants gasping for water.dramatic instances of water shortages and restrictions highlight how water-greedy some gardens can be.watering a little every day encourages lots of surface roots and the plants never really get enough moisture.
