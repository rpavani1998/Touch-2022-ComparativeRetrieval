the government and the wind energy industry have long maintained turbines have no adverse effects on property values, health or the environment.about 18,000 households with 50,000 people in hawaii rely on rainwater as their sole source of drinking water.the actual toxic effect of this exposure would be lower than what the table below indicates, because radiation received over a period of time is somewhat less harmful than a dose received all at once.ingested alpha emitter radioisotopes (such as transuranics or actinides) are an average of about 20 times more dangerous, and in some experiments up to 1000 times more dangerous, than an equivalent activity of beta emitting or gamma emitting radioisotopes.under government standards, sludge can be used in a landfill as long as the radioactive cesium contained in it measures 8,000 becquerels per kilogram or lower.it is important that people have the courage to be generalists, while also cultivating whatever specialized skills they may have."when dissolved in water, radionuclides are colorless, odorless, and tasteless, and typically cannot be detected by our senses, unlike many other contaminants that may cause an undesirable color, odor, or taste.the cbc has documented scores of families who've discovered their property values are not only going downward, but also some who are unable to sell and have even abandoned their homes because of concerns nearby turbines are affecting their health.â€œpolonium, when absorbed orally, tends to distribute widely through the tissues of the body, approximating whole body radiation exposure.despite this, some 27,700 tons of sludge --- 51 percent of the total --- remains in storage at water treatment plants.rainwater and cow milk in hawaii is contaminated.alpha particle radiation (wikipedia) when alpha particle emitting isotopes are ingested, they are far more dangerous than their half-life or decay rate would suggest, due to the high relative biological effectiveness of alpha radiation to cause biological damage, after alpha-emitting radioisotopes enter living cells.acute poisoning is rare.all of these characteristics ensure that the technetium-99 produced from technetium-99m produces very little extra radiation burden on the body.polonium is excreted fairly quickly, its effective half-life in the body is about 30 days (mostly due to excretion, but also due to radioactive decay).
