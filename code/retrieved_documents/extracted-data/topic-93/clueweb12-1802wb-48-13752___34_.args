they are highly effective at removing such things as cysts, parasites, and harmful pathogens (to 99.99999%), while also removing many unwanted chemicals and contaminants to undetectable levels.producing bottled water also has a high carbon footprint price â€“ it takes 20,000 times more energy to produce bottled water than the same amount of tap water.pollution at u.s. beaches exposes swimmers to a range of waterborne illnesses and may cause stomach flu, skin rashes, pinkeye, ear, nose and throat problems, dysentery, hepatitis, respiratory ailments, neurological disorders and other serious health problems.in many urban areas, rain runoff from roofs and roads is directed into the same pipes that carry household sewage to the local water treatment plant.this means it can be counted on to deliver safe, clean water even during power outages.soda drinkers accumulate fat in dangerous, hard-to-detect places some of the health effects correlated with soda consumption may actually be due to the likelihood that calories from these sugared drinks displace healthier beverages that would have provided important nutrients or that heavy soda drinkers have a poor diet overall.the public could also be better protected by improving water quality testing speed, accuracy, and public notification systems.in more rural areas, poorly contained animal agriculture operations allow rain to wash waste into waterways.it can save you money and allow you to do your part in contributing to a cleaner environment.good quality systems successfully remove bacteria, chlorine, organic solvents, vocs, lead, mercury, nitrates and nitrites as well as other harmful substances.during very heavy storms, the system can be overwhelmed and rainwater and untreated sewage simply overflows into local waterways.both provide a great foundation for emergency preparedness.swimmers and other beach-goers, especially pregnant women, children, the elderly and those with a weakened immune system need to heed warnings and stay out of the water when bacteria levels rise.according to federal regulations bottled water is not much safer than tap water, as the chemical pollution standards are almost the same.there is no national reporting system in the united states to help epidemiologists track national trends, but the centers for disease control estimate that illness from contaminated beach water is on the rise.
