acid rain created from air pollution makes water an unsuitable habitat for animals and plants to survive.students also learn the problems of contamination, how to prevent pollution problems in our own backyards and more environmentally friendly practices to help keep our water supplies safe from contamination.it is important not to pollute groundwater because it can reach rivers and lakes where it can harm fish and other life.it is important to protect our water supply by reducing all pollution.wetlands help to retain extra water during high flow periods (snowmelt and significant rainstorm water) and augment river flow throughout the year.if the habitat is polluted with oil, the plants and animals in that habitat are very seriously damaged and may even die.students will have the opportunity to see how groundwater is pumped from the aquifer to a reservoir, treated (chlorinated) and piped through a distribution system to be delivered to homes and businesses in the community.using a hands-on model of a residential area, students will discover how we can affect the groundwater and surface water in our environment through non-environmentally friendly practices in our own backyards.- wetlands play an important role in our environment both from a hydrological standpoint and also the wide variety of animals and plants that depend on this habitat to survive.students will gain an understanding of how much has to be done to each drop of water that comes out of our taps and sprinklers and that we should conserve water as much as possible.participants get a chance to learn what it is all about and how we can ensure safe water supplies for all our needs through hands-on activities using working models of agricultural areas.students also learn the problems of hazardous waste contamination, how to clean up and prevent hazardous wastes from adversely affecting the environment.rivers, streams, lakes and ponds all possess a wide variety of plant and animal life.drop zone students discover water towers not only store the water we need for our homes, schools and businesses but also provide the pressure necessary to get that water to us.each step of the process from cleaning, heating, and treating waste water creates air pollution.
