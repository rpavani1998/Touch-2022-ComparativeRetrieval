growing our own “we need a comprehensive planning system that incorporates protecting watersheds and water sources, stimulating far more local farming, smart growth linked to transportation and more clean energy.without secure water sources, local diversified agriculture can’t expand to provide better food security.“we need a comprehensive planning system that incorporates protecting watersheds and water sources, stimulating far more local farming, smart growth linked to transportation and more clean energy.the loss of interdependent native rainforest plants can put an entire area ecosystem’s survival at risk.watershed-saving partnerships these private/public, non-profit watershed partnership collaborations allow those who know the land best to develop the most effective remedies for the unique problems each watershed faces.heavy reliance on imported food means that, in effect, we also import the water it takes to grow that food, water from national and world sources now undergoing dramatic changes via global warming.these ungulates devastate indigenous plant species, creating puddles that harbor avian mosquitoes and spreading non-native strawberry guavas.according to christy martin of cgaps, 200 invasive plants pose serious threats to the balance of watershed forests.watershed management tactics the loss of interdependent native rainforest plants can put an entire area ecosystem’s survival at risk.strawberry guavas, which grow to 15 feet and now engulf 495,000 acres, causing serious losses of rare endemic flora and fauna, as well as consuming water that never reaches the rest of the ecosystem.we’ve done so by failing to adequately conserve our natural watersheds, the mountain forests that collect and filter the water we drink.our heavy reliance on global food sources puts us at serious risk.seventy percent of freshwater allocations globally already go to farmland irrigation, and swelling megacities compete for that water.total annual hawaii losses to invasive species are estimated at $300 million, not counting the loss of water in island aquifers.grossly underfunded inspection and prevention measures mean higher watershed protection costs.
