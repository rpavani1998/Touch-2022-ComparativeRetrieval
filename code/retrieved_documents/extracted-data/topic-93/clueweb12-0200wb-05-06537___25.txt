my advice about rain barrels is to buy them locally, with some sort of warranty about quality, or at least good word-of-mouth.
they save (a little) on our water bills, though not enough to justify  using them on the basis of cost alone.
i think rainwater collection is going to become increasingly important in the next few years.

i am certainly glad to see that we are finally learning the value of water and reinventing more ways to recyle it.

i use the rainwater mostly for potted plants or to water recently-transplanted seedlings.

after several years one of them froze and cracked, after which she found even better barrels.

also, the  spigot needs to be really close to the bottom of the barrel so you can get all  the water.
plus the exercise i gain filling and lugging my watering cans is another perk.
why all the interest in rain barrels?
so you cut off a section in the appropriate height and  then put it away to use again when the rain barrel is gone for the winter.

if your barrel is screened off like this, then you shouldn't need mosquito dunks because they shouldn't be getting into the water.

as to whether fine mesh screen needs to be used, the gardener's supply barrel has a "lid" that's made of screening material to keep out debris and bugs.

rainfall tended to be short heavy thunder storms during the summer but the barrel provided enough basic water supply.

not sure if this was mentioned in the original post, but you can easily "chain" barrels by setting two side by side and placing a hose between them.
i'd like to add a couple more barrels.

when we bought our home 15 years ago from a then 80 year old gardener & florist, he had just a huge blue barrel under one of the down-spouts, so i left it and used it for all my potted containers-outdoors in the summer and indoors during the non-freezing times the rest of the year.
i just don't see myself shelling out the big bucks for all the new barrels and items that are now available.
aquabarrel sells refurbished 55-gallon barrels for $100 at retail outlets,  which is preferable because shipping even locally starts at about $55 for one  barrel.

unfortunately, the largest size refurbished barrel is 55 gallons; barrels from unrecycled materials are available in larger sizes.
for one i replaced the entire section with  those "flexible downspout extensions" they sell everywhere.
they were badly caulked by the seller, and i failed to improve matters by choosing the wrong caulking material when i gave it a go.

to provide the information to others i created a website on how to build your own rainbarrel for about $40.
the only way a rain barrel system would benefit my small suburban garden is if it was paired up with a grey water system and i modified my sub- tropical plant collection habit to include only drought tolerant plants.
we cut a hole at the top into the side and added a spigot for easy emptying on the bottom.
the lower pressure is just right for hooking up a hose, dragging it to the base of a shrub and leaving it for a while as i putter around other parts of the yard.

heavy metals from car pollution settled on the roof are a slight concern.
(and how do i fix it?):
i don't think these barrels can be used to help with vegetables and edible plants unless the water from asphalt roofs is cleaned.
the steps had a little landing at the top and as it was about 4' above the garden we ran a gravity-fed drip hose from a tap my clever partner soldered into the barrel near the bottom and that serviced all four 10x4' vegetable beds.
ten good minutes of rain would refill the barrel.
fills easily after not much rain, and really helps get through dry spells.
the homemade one is closed except for the  hole that the downspout empties into.
no leaks and best of all the overflow is super huge and we have never had water overflow out the top - it takes a 4" landscape pipe - we buried the landscape pipe and also used their drainbox at the end of the pipe at the rain garden (limits erosion) - no mosquito issue to speak of either.
