it would be highly appreciated, because i was surprised.
despite this, some 27,700 tons of sludge --- 51 percent of the total --- remains in storage at water treatment plants.
that would be (1,525,000 μsv), close to severe radiation poisoning.

alpha particle radiation (wikipedia) when alpha particle emitting isotopes are ingested, they are far more dangerous than their half-life or decay rate would suggest, due to the high relative biological effectiveness of alpha radiation to cause biological damage, after alpha-emitting radioisotopes enter living cells.
(reuters) - jx nippon oil & energy corp, japan's top refiner, said on saturday the fire at sendai refinery appears to have originated from a land oil product shipping facility, not from an lpg tank as earlier thought, following a strong quake that hit northeastern japan on friday.
by the way, the meter i use for gauging the effectiveness of my reverse osmosis system shows that baltimore tap water is at 74 parts per million.
the actual toxic effect of this exposure would be lower than what the table below indicates, because radiation received over a period of time is somewhat less harmful than a dose received all at once.
the fact that he became ill so quickly indicates he was poisoned with many times the lethal dose of po-210.
so physically i'm fit, though the knowledge of what might happen in the middle of the night if.... is quite a burden mentally.
acute poisoning is rare.
revolutionaries are a) less prone to brainwashing, b) are able to empower others, c) maintain an alter-ego or outsider mindset in all circumstances, at all times and with all individuals.
this would account for his falling ill apparently within hours of exposure.
one is that enormous amounts of this isotope were released so that, even though a large amount of half life cycles took place, there was still a significant amount remaining by the time it reached canada.
reporting of this, i think, really discredits the nuclear industry, the governments, the major news media.

this delay is partly due to the time is takes to accumulate dangerous internal exposures, and partly due to the time delay of 1-2 weeks after dangerous exposure before serious illness becomes evident.
most of the canadian reactors are in ontario for some reason.
the reactors for units 1, 2, and 6 were supplied by general electric, those for units 3 and 5 by toshiba, and unit 4 by hitachi.
excessive levels of radioactive cesium found 100 km from plant / 186.000 bq/kg: "excessive levels of radioactive cesium were found in sludge in a ditch at a district court branch in fukushima prefecture, about 100 kilometers west of the crippled fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant, the court said tuesday.
ingested alpha emitter radioisotopes (such as transuranics or actinides) are an average of about 20 times more dangerous, and in some experiments up to 1000 times more dangerous, than an equivalent activity of beta emitting or gamma emitting radioisotopes.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/technetium-99m "molybdenum-99 is produced commercially by intense neutron-bombardment of a highly purified uranium-235 target, followed rapidly by extraction.[3] it is used as a parent radioisotope in technetium-99m generators to produce the even shorter-lived daughter isotope technetium-99m, which is used in many medical procedures.

“after the country's 1995 earthquake, japan placed high-tech sensors around the country to observe even the slightest movements, which is why scientists are able to calculate the quake's impact down to the inch.
we've always said it helps when the japanese speak out.
the majority of mo-99 produced for tc-99m medical use comes from fission of heu (highly enriched uranium) from only five reactors around the world: nru, canada; br2, belgium; safari-1, south africa; hfr (petten), the netherlands; and the osiris reactor in saclay, france.[1][2] production from leu (low-enriched uranium) is possible, and is produced at the new opal reactor, australia, as well as other sites.
the quake also shifted the earth's axis by 6.5 inches, shortened the day by 1.6 microseconds, and sank japan downward by about two feet.
we get our drinking water from the lake.
the club was able several times over the years to prove evidence of radioactive releases the french had "forgotten" to mention.
i am still not seeing why the man in canada would find that it is hotter immediately after the rain, but then "decays away" within about 30 minutes, unless it is not actually "decaying away," but simply evaporating back into the air or getting absorbed into the soil (or otherwise dispersing away from the spot where the rain had initially landed).
my guess is that high readings in video are a combination of fuki and local sources.
the isotope in the sludge, sampled from a ditch at the fukushima district court's aizuwakamatsu branch, measured about 186,000 becquerels per kilogram, the court said, adding it plans to remove the sludge after consulting with local governments.
i see what your trying to get at here...if it evaporates it should leave most of the particles behind, however it seems to me where the water went he found hot spots and the ground saturation must have taken the isotopes into the earth/mud...maybe these beta/alpha particles are water soluable!
lack of a parachute does not affect happy people.
maybe from fukushima but lots of old reactors operating and they don't want to disrupt their precious economy.

“paid areas of bart stations are reserved for ticketed passengers who are boarding, exiting or waiting for bart cars and trains, or for authorized bart personnel.
polonium is excreted fairly quickly, its effective half-life in the body is about 30 days (mostly due to excretion, but also due to radioactive decay).

also, doesn't strontium have a half-life of 29 years (i don't know what tellurium has).
because of its short half-life and rapid decay, a small quantity of polonium-210 is intensely active.
currently, workers at the plant are being evacuated from the refinery, and there was no work under way to extinguish the fire, a company spokesman said.

by the way, look at the entry in the pdf for 3/16-3/17.
but i say that jumping out of an airplane without a parachute does not kill you directly either.
on august 4, the georgia straight ran an article on “fukushima fallout”, reporting, among other concerns, that air radiation measurements in several canadian cities exceeded legislated maximum concentrations after the fukushima disaster; that canadian radionuclide monitoring and reporting is lacking transparency and consistency; and that there are many concerned health professionals, including those interviewed in the article .

but it happens to be my reading of the real time data which the effect of the sun etc cannot explain- frequent man made natural disaster by the cumulative effects of modern civilisation's consumptive greedy profiteering life style.
if it does worsen to that point… there won’t be a lot of positive spin the governments of japan and america can muster for the new evacuation measures.
eastern japan shifted 13 feet closer to the u.s.
as japan's eastern coastline sunk, the tsunami's waves rolled in.
i was indoors, with a friend, during the storm (which i barely noticed).
all of these characteristics ensure that the technetium-99 produced from technetium-99m produces very little extra radiation burden on the body.
the mass media will be drawn back into the story by forces beyond their control.
thus 4 millicuries (a minimal lethal dose for 80 kg person) is 0.89 micrograms, an almost invisible speck of matter.
in the hour or two that elapses during gastrointestinal uptake of the poison, the gi system (which is about 3% of body mass) receives disproportionate radiation exposure, amounting to perhaps a few days worth of whole body exposure.
technically you would eventually accumulate the same 'lack of altitude' even with the parachute deployed, so we should factor time into the equation...
i read it decays quickly and is present in the rain.
you will know it is really bad in japan when america evacuates the us troops stationed in southern japan.
its "specific activity" is 4490 curies/g (166 tbq/g).
the isotope ratios for that day demonstrate that a nuclear explosion occurred, especially the large amount of tc-99m.
this outsider (comparison of differences is the mother of all understanding) perspective can be cultivated to the destruction of mass brainwashing, conditioning (institutional, cultural or despotically intentional or not) by working hard to understand everything...be a generalist!!!
makes it much more real and personal.
the cat has started wheezing again.
due to its short half-life, technetium-99m for nuclear medicine purposes is usually extracted from technetium-99m generators which contain molybdenum-99 (mo-99, half-life 2.75 days), which is the usual parent nuclide for this isotope.
off the top of my head i think the great lakes has twenty or so nuclear power plants on its shores.
high levels of radiation in the toronto area does not mean it came from fukushima.

but i don't think that would cause radio-active rain water.
20,000 cpm at one location as a hot spot does not rule out even hotter spots.
this results in a maximum total exposure equal to about 43 times the first day exposure.
when the body metabolizes tellurium in any oxidation state, the tellurium gets converted into dimethyl telluride.
ge boasts they made umpteen billion dollars last year, but paid zero dollars in american taxes.
but i'm a vegetarian since age 13 (i'm 36 now) and never started smoking.

cesium 134 and 137 may cause acute cardiac infarct.
i think after fuki ordinary people started to measure radiation and when they find high levels they blame it on fuki but could be a local source.
humans exposed to as little as 0.01 mg/m3 or less in air develop "tellurium breath", which has a garlic-like odour.
anyway, one thing is for sure, we are running the most significant experiment ever of the consequences of radioactive fallout.
in fact, 3 workers have already been irradiated there this year alone.
the instruments are set up on private properties near the plant.
last year's massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake in chile also shortened the day, but by an even smaller fraction of a second.
this scenario contrasts strikingly with the reported symptoms of litvinenko, who fell ill the day he was poisoned, was seriously ill on day 11 later, in critical condition on day 20, and was dead on day 23.

with sober calculation, he designed the ritual rallies of the nazis--the repeated oaths, the arm raising, the songs.”
the garlic odour that is associated with human intake of tellurium compounds is caused from the tellurium being metabolized by the body.
just like many japanese workers from fukushima, and also many healthy who worked in chernobyl.
the epa has also stopped monitoring for radiation.
that is around 1525 μsv from the particle during its life, which is equal to a spinal x-ray.
even polonium that was not absorbed, but passed through the gi tract and was excreted would expose the radiation-sensitive gi lining.
in addition, 7 storage facilities in 4 prefectures have had to set up "no entry zones" where radiation levels have gotten too high.
i wouldn't eat a fish from lake ontario....
i'm also not preparing to live to a ripe old age.
the resulting gastrointestinal syndrome, which is due to the destruction of the gi lining with exposures of about 700 cgy, would account for the severe illness that led to his death in scarcely more than three weeks.

serious illness would not be expected for a month or more.
that means it is alpha or beta radiation.
so on the avaerage that 1525μsv will cause about 20x the damage as normal radiation (30,480μsv), which according to the chart is equal to smoking a pack a day for a year.
dealing with a4p does not exactly make it more convenient...
the majority of people will literally never know what hit them.
“the "alert level" for the national radiation map is 100 cpm, so if you see any monitoring stations with cpm value above 100, further indicated by an alert symbol over those stations, it probably means that some radioactive source above and beyond background radiation is responsible.”
we know things have actually worsened in the past 9 weeks...
this makes me wonder whether at least some of what he is finding are more short-lived isotopes from more local sources (maybe on top of the longer-live fuk stuff).
so horrific it's come to this but since the media is not reporting anything, we must.
by the time of his death his total exposure might have reached a few thousand cgy, levels that would injur his cardiovascular system directly and might be related to litvinenko's heart attack shortly before his death.”
ditto for the thousands of scientists who rely on government grants to stay afloat.
80 miles off the eastern coast of japan, six miles below the surface on the ocean floor, a rift opened up hundreds of miles wide, causing huge portions of the earth’s crust to tumble inside.
the radiation is not caused by cesium, which is more of a gamma emitter.
but these monsters will blame it on something other than nuclear power.
the earth's mass shifted towards the center, spurring the planet to spin a bit faster.
under government standards, sludge can be used in a landfill as long as the radioactive cesium contained in it measures 8,000 becquerels per kilogram or lower.
us agencies says that is ok because the radiation particles in rainwater are diluted in public water supplies.
