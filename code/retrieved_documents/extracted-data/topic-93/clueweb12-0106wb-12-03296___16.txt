venus fly traps and all other carnivorous plants should only be watered with distilled water, rain water, reverse osmosis water (from an ro system).

venus fly trap written by yo, september 01, 2009 can someone give me some tips on how to grow a venus flytrap in a tropical area?
i am a beginner and dont know anyhting about them.
and i currently use this "pur" water filtration pitcher.
everybody who asked about the different types of water are obviously unexperienced, so your plants are gonna die anyways.
if you repotted your vft in fertilized soil, it will burn the roots.
so i don't know by experience, but most from theory.
dont start out with seeds.
written by matt, february 12, 2009 scott, you'll find tons of information on this in the forum, but basically you just sprinkle the seeds on top of the peat moss and keep them very moist until they germinate then you put them in a sunny windowsill to continue growing.
since they don't like the cold, i don't think they would like it if you watered with cool water.
ive been doing this for almost a week.
quick answer - your venus flytrap will be fine if it never eats a bug in its entire life.
one way to water a venus flytrap is the tray method.
color help written by edmond, november 29, 2010 hi since my venus fly trap is going to go into dormancy will all the leafs turn black and re color back in spring and does the leafs look very dead black?
the tray method works well when plants are actively growing, are in lots of direct sunlight, and the weather is warm, or during vacations when one is not able to check one's plants.
2) how oftern do you water them?
you can join the forum by clicking on the forum link at the top or right side of any page.
the seeds have usually set on the shelf for too long and aren't viable any longer.
really, just don't use tap water.
re: ... written by matt, april 06, 2009
because the plants should be kept cool  for much of the time during their dormancy, it is best to allow the growing  medium to become almost dry before watering again.
it is especially important during theirdormancy to avoid wet conditions when it is very cool or cold at the same time.
i use distilled water.
scott re: just got my seeds!
you should try to use distilled water, rain water or reverse osmosis water.
venus fly traps don't usually make very good terrarium pets.
sometimes this means watering only 2-3 times per month during the growing season, depending on weather, humidity and the size of the pot the plant is growing in (larger pots often retain water for a longer period).
otherwise, if the plant and growing medium can be monitored, it is best to  water and then allow the medium to dry until just moist before watering again.
although it may not be immediately apparent with a few waterings, over time, the dissolved solids will begin to build up in the soil and can lead to a sickly looking plant and eventually death of the plant.
if you have a question join the forum!
it's great to look at everyone's feedback + comments janene xx food written by raymond hughes, march 08, 2010 im considering buying a venus fly trap
in any case, your seeds might need longer to germinate, or they might never germinate.

there are tons of people hear that would love to hear about your plants.
question: is it ok for me to put my fly trap under a lamp next to a window?
i noticed the first trap i got was starting to get little wrinkles and now one part of it has a very subtle tinge of light brown i noticed.
do you have any particular reason for growing them in a terrarium?
i live in munich so its pretty cold.
the time you spent on here asking about other types of water you could have spent getting the water recommended by every carnivorous plant website on the internet.
but i wanna know what type of bugs would be acceptable to give it and if i cooked my water on the stove to clean
i doubt boiling normal tap water works.
larger pots allow for more mistakes, and beginners make mistakes, so i recommend a 4-6 inch pot.
~teen just got my seeds!
therefore the tray method (described and pictured below)  is best used only while the plants are in direct sunlight in hot weather, or  when one goes on vacation to ensure that the medium does not dry completely.
should i water it differently or continue with the same.
no water should be vissible if you happen to press on the soil.
will this be good or what do i do?
however, the tray method is often not a good method to use all  the time (see the paragraph above).
or could i use bottled table water for her?
otherwise, if the plant and growing medium can be monitored, it is best to water and then allow the medium to dry until just moist before watering again.
no, never use fertilised soil.

how do i correct this?
about venus traps and watering... written by duvet, october 21, 2010
it is best to let the water disapear for a little bit before adding water to the tray, as long as they don't dry out.
i live in a area with lots of air pollution including an petrochemical plant.
is that okay to do?" no, it's not ok.
is that safe for the plant?
if you let the tap water sit for a day or so dos that work?
i'm hopeing to get a venus fly trap sometime in august.
the dissolved solids that are in tap  water - namely sodium, calcium, alkaline salts, sulfur, chlorine and magnesium  - are detrimental to the health of your dionaea.
the media  will soak up water from a tray or bowl almost like a sponge.
therefore the tray method (described and pictured below) is best used only while the plants are in direct sunlight in hot weather, or when one goes on vacation to ensure that the medium does not dry completely.
it's completely damp and sealed inside a plastic bag.
the six inchers can accomodate even the most mature flytraps.
it's possible to grow them in terrariums, but they are healthier and more robust if they are grown outside.
best regards, karen (south africa)
the growing medium ideally should be just moist, not soggy or waterlogged.
if you feed it never ever give it anything it could not catch itself in the swamp.
i have barely had my plant for a week.
although higher levels of tds can be tolerated (up to 100 ppm (parts per million)) or so, in that case the growing medium would need to be flushed occasionally by watering several times over a period of several hours or perhaps a day, and the plants may benefit from repotting (changing the growing medium) once per year or so.
am i doing anything wrong?
yes, if you are talking about using the water from the freezer, that should be fine to use.
hopefully these 2 plants will survive as my first attempt ended in death i think it was a combo of bad light & bad water.

no germination visable written by dan, february 28, 2009 i bought a venus fly trap seed kit sometime in january and it told me to prepare the seeds by imitating a dormancy period first.
secondly, can i use boiled tap water to water my plants?
can i still keep it here during winter or should i take it outside to simulate the winter weather.
i watered my first trap with chlorine water for a week or two but when i got two new flytraps i started watering with rain water i collected.
despite the description you gave, i am still abit confused.
one important thing i have noticed with the death of my last vft.
during their active growing season, venus flytraps should be monitored, especially during hot and dry weather, to ensure that their growing medium does not dry out completely.
sometimes this means  watering only 2-3 times per month during the growing season, depending on  weather, humidity and the size of the pot the plant is growing in (larger pots  often retain water for a longer period).
if i have flytraps in a terrarium - is the natural condensation which forms enough to keep the plants healthy or should i water as well?
is this ok or does sterilized water still contain impurities?

matt well water? written by tom, january 08, 2009 would well water be okay for a venus flytrap?
so keeping the plant and medium  "moist, not wet" most of the time is a good general rule, and it  should be less moist most of the time during its dormancy when the air is cool  to cold.
to prevent stagnation, can i choose not to place my flytrap on a bowl with water on it and just use a spray bottle to spray some water at the plant?
i'd love to hear updates on your progress.
or does it just take a little longer?
they are prone to rot (as [matt] you probably know).
