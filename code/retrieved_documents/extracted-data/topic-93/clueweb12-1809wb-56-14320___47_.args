the technologies used in green chemistry provide waste reduction, safer products, less use of energy and resources, and improve competitiveness of chemical manufacturers.using tap water will lessen the cost of buying drinking water and will minimize the use of plastic bottles which contains chemicals that are hazardous to their health.these toxic chemicals are dangerous to human health because they affect our nervous systems.trout will survive in the right amount of dissolve oxygen found in clean water, that is without the presence of toxic chemicals.these principles will help them understand the importance of water to all living organisms and how to keep drinking water clean and safe.humans and animals need fresh water which is free of salt, chemicals and pathogens.however, in other parts of the world, the people are experiencing water shortages, drought, and people have to walk hours to get drinking water from wells which are contaminated with pathogens.when droughts occur, the water in reservoirs is not enough for its people, plants, animals and industry.it could also be used to fight cholera and typhoid fever when added to purify drinking water.when water flows through the rivers and gets collected in aquifers, the contaminants are low and not hazardous to human health.the presence of coliforms in water indicates that sewage is present and there may be other disease causing organisms.these products contain phosphates, neurotoxins and carcinogens that contribute to groundwater pollution.they are harmful to humans, plants and animals.their water supply causes illnesses and diseases for humans and animals.we depend on the water cycle because it renews and purifies our water supply.
