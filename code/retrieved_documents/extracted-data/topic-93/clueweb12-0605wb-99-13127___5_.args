this stored water then becomes a great alternative to tap/city water and can be used during periods of dry or drought to water gardens, trees, and other plants.to the average homeowner, a rain barrel is merely a simple and inexpensive way to catch and store rainwater as it flows from a building's roof into the gutters and downspouts.this process requires large amounts of energy; therefore using rainwater instead of treated tap/city water for irrigating plants saves energy.this accelerated draining process not only increases flooding but it also leaves our streams lower and drier for longer periods of time.therefore, if we catch stormwater in a barrel and later release this water back into the ground when watering our gardens and trees, we're both decreasing the flooding that rain event would have otherwise causedand helping to replenish the ground water and the streams during that period of dry when the streams need it most.rain is naturally soft water and devoid of minerals, chlorine, fluoride, and other chemicals.but it's important that we all use water wisely, especially on our lawns and gardens and other times when we don't really need to use drinking water to get the job done.impervious areas also mean that water that would have otherwise been absorbed into the ground and gradually seeped back into our streams over a period of days, now flows straight through our stream system in the course of hours, many times causing flooding.for this reason, plants respond very well to rainwater.second, stormwater falling on an impervious area such as pavement, concrete, or a rooftop generally drains straight to a storm drain, ditch, or directly into a creek instead of soaking into the ground.more information how to make your own rain barrel a simple and inexpensive way to catch and store rainwater that can later be used to water your lawns and gardens during dry periods.water coming from your tap has been treated at the treatment plant in order to make it suitable for drinking.fixing leaky faucets, catching rinse water in a bowl to water outdoor plants, and even catching rain water in a bucket to use when you scrub the patio are smart yet simple ideas that we call can use to save water and save money.since one inch of rainfall provides approximately 600 gallons of water for a 1,000 sq. ft catchment area, you could collect 1200 gallons during a 1‚Äù rain.thanks to the cumberland river nashville has an abundant supply of water.
