this places a large percentage of the population at an increased risk from their drinking water as these once plentiful and pristine sources are becoming contaminated and scarce.regardless, protection with a home water filter is essential for homeowners whose wells have been compromised by these harmful trace minerals or chemical pollutants.regardless, protection with a home water filter is essential for homeowners whose wells have been compromised by these harmful trace minerals or chemical pollutants.it can often contain chemicals similar to acid rain yet also churn up undrinkable salt water from the ocean that causes corrosive damage.these sorts of “mishaps” not only threaten to contaminate our own drinking water, but also destroy existence of any animal, fish, and plant life in the affected and surrounding regions.in addition, the usefulness of water contained in these natural reservoirs is being compromised by pollution from industrial and household chemicals.disturbance of natural waterways another contributor to the depletion and contamination of our water sources is the fact that housing development is no longer limited to geographical locations with a ready source of water.in many u.s. communities the system of water and sewer pipes, mains and treatment plants that deliver drinking water and sanitation are aging and in need of repair.when e. coli contaminates your drinking water, one should either avoid drinking it completely, or render it safe by boiling the water or purifying it with a high quality water filter.when these waters are used as sources of drinking water and the water is not adequately treated, e. coli may be inadvertently ingested.another contributor to the depletion and contamination of our water sources is the fact that housing development is no longer limited to geographical locations with a ready source of water.storm water and wastewater can then mix and overflow, ultimately resulting in contaminated drinking water.as our lands continue to be treated with fertilizers and chemicals, in concert with continued land development, population growth, and industry pollution we experience an ever increasing trickling of chemical waste into our groundwater systems and waterways.as our lands continue to be treated with fertilizers and chemicals, in concert with continued land development, population growth, and industry pollution we experience an ever increasing trickling of chemical waste into our groundwater systems and waterways.even in communities with state of the art treatment facilities, the infrastructure that connects these facilities to homes, businesses, and schools is often in dire need of repair and maintenance.
