they can be in the form of long tap roots (in plants like sea kale, crambe maritima), or in bulbs, corms and tubers, such as alliums and eremurus.
- to reduce irrigation, use a thick mulch to limit evaporation from the soil.
this kind of preparation enables the soil to hold on to water without becoming waterlogged, thus allowing rapid establishment of plants.
storage organs can help a plant survive the driest periods by collecting water at times of plenty.
at peak times, up to 70% of household water may be used in gardens.
the most valuable natural resource in a garden is water.
getting the soil right essential to any new planting is proper soil preparation.
choosing the right plants plants that grow in mediterranean areas have developed distinctive types of foliage and storage systems, to minimise water loss or store water in periods of drought.
a waxy or glaucous coating helps seal in moisture.
all of this means that careful selection of plants is crucial to their success.
many plants, native to these areas, can survive on very little moisture and most will grow well in dry areas with hot summers.
at peak times, up to 70% of household water may be used in gardens.
it is better to give plants a good soaking than to water little and often.
their leaves' small surface area prevents excess water loss through evaporation and some will roll their leaves inwards, reducing the surface even more.

leathery or waxy leaves (such as bergenia and sedum) help prevent water loss and evaporation by the wind; they are usually grey in colour, ( like lavender, right) which will reflect the glare of the sun.
some plants, like bottlebrushes (callistemon) or fennel (foeniculum vulgare), reduce their leaf size so much that the stem turns green and takes over as the main photosynthesising organ.
- install as many water butts and tanks as possible to capture and store rainwater from times of plenty, for use during dry periods.
with heavy clay this can mean incorporating grit to open the soil, and organic matter to enrich it.
to check the application rates, use rain gauges positioned nearby when watering.

as a guide, 24 litres per sqm every 7-10 days will be sufficient to maintain plant growth.
also stir up the water periodically to ensure oxygen is present.
hairy leaves (such as those on verbascums and phlomis) help reduce the drying effect of the wind and will reflect the sun's rays.
many plants, native to these areas, can survive on very little moisture and most will grow well in dry areas with hot summers.
coarse sand might hold 5cm of rainfall in the top 60cm of soil, while a clay soil might hold 10.5cm of rain.
if you are on light or sandy soil, organic matter added in acts in the same way, helping water retention.
water saving notes plants need most water in hot, dry weather - when water companies are least able to supply the demand.
grasses and conifers have thin, needle-like leaves that lose very little water.
in california, the south west cape district of south africa, chile, south and western australia and the mediterranean, most of the year's rain falls during the cooler months, and summers are dry.
