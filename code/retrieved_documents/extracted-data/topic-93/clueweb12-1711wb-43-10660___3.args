most of the on-site water resources have limited application, and are never suitable for human consumption.
the economic benefit-cost ratio of rain barrel systems is not favorable when compared to most potable water prices.
each rain barrel will store only 50 to 60 gallons (189.2 l to 227.1 l) of water.
in general, larger rainwater storage systems will often be more cost effective than rain barrels if the water is to be used beyong local landscape irrigation.
the quality of stormwater varies greatly from different sites; the water quality determines the appropriate uses, or if water treatment is needed before the water is utilized.
these water sources are non-potable, and vary greatly in quality.
the various alternate water sources are collected in the cistern, and often filtered and sanitized for use in flushing urinals and toilets throughout the building.
in some designs, the cisterns hold additional alternate water resources (gray water, condensate, cooling tower blow-down, etc.) along with the rain water for uses beyond irrigation of landscape.
during parts of the country with dry summers, the water is valuable, but rainfall is too infrequent to regularly refill the barrels as needed.
at a cost of $80 to $120 per purchased rain barrel, a system with a 624 gallon (2.4 m3) capacity will cost more than $1,200.
while it is true that the rainwater can be used to flush toilets, the added cost of equipment to convey the water to the toilets might hamper overall cost effectiveness; one barrel of water is unlikely to supply more than 3 days worth of flushing water for the typical home.
the green building industry is slowly but steadily advancing water conservation and rain water collection in its strategies; and cisterns provide a means to store the rainwater for later use.
(a do-it-yourself project will cost about $20/barrel in hardware, assuming a used plastic barrel is available free of charge)
rain barrel systems can be a great way to harvest rain water to supplement irrigation needs.
desert plants, such as agave, form concave appendages to capture rain drops and direct the water towards the root zone.
these barrels are connected to the downspouts of the home’s roof gutters to collect the rain water from the roof.
the rain barrels include a tap at the bottom of the barrel for users to attach garden hoses as a means to convey the water to landscape plants.
each rain barrel will store only 50 to 60 gallons (189.2 l to 227.1 l) of water.
in whatever size and form, rainwater harvesting usually is one of the purest waters available of all the alternate water sources.
in typical us cities, where 50% of the landscape is paved over, a 1 inch rain event produces more than 150 million gallons (567,811.8 m3) of stormwater per square mile.
probably the original alternate water source, rainwater harvesting dates back to pre-historic times in rudimentary forms.
these barrels are connected to the downspouts of the home’s roof gutters to collect the rain water from the roof.
the typical cistern storage capacity ranges from 500 to 10,000 gallons per cistern (1.9 m3 to 37.8 m3) ; although multiple cisterns are often interconnected in large building sites.
the cisterns were used to supplement the well water, especially during extended droughts when groundwater levels receded below well depth.
there are many water sources available on building sites that can supplement the more traditional water sources.
additional information: american rainwater catchment association (arcsa) generally, the term stormwater harvesting refers to rainwater collected from non-roof surfaces, such as parking lots, hardscapes, and landscapes surrounding urban buildings.
new inventive designs are using corrugated steel bins (originally fabricated for grain storage) with a plastic liner to create a water vessel.
even high-rise office buildings are now collecting rain water in cisterns.
this water may collect many pollutants as it travels across landscapes and hardscapes.
the texas cities of austin and san antonio offer rebates for rainwater capture and reuse.1 it is important to be cautious when using stormwater as an alternative water supply.
despite its imitial purity, rain water can be easily contaminated by: air-pollution; heavy metals and other toxins in roofing materials, paints, solvents, lead soldering, zinc coatings and adhesives; bird and rodent feces; and mosquitoes.
in most climates, rain barrel systems should be valued for the rainwater’s superior quality (no chlorine, chloramines and other treatment chemicals) as irrigation water.
at a cost of $80 to $120 per purchased rain barrel, a system with a 624 gallon (2.4 m3) capacity will cost more than $1,200.
(rain water is superior to treated potable water for irrigating plants.)
texas provides sales tax exemptions for rainwater capture and reuse systems.
capturing the full 624 gallons (2.4 m3) requires more than 12 rain barrels.
once the barrels are full, they cannot collect additional water until emptied.
the water might absorb heavy metals from the roofing materials and gutters; and the water might contain e. coli, absorbed from bird and animal droppings from the roof surface.

tucson arizona requests residents to build berms and swales in their landscape to retain the rainwater.
harvested rainwater is considered potableonly after proper treatment and disinfection.
in rural areas, the advances in well drilling technology allows for deeper wells, where groundwater levels seldom fall below well depth.
even when a ten-year lifecycle is used for the barrels in a rainy us climate, the water collected over the ten years would cost approximately $4.55 per ccf, and this assumes the water is put to beneficial use and replacing potable water use.
also consider the need to drain and bypass the rain barrels during monsoon seasons of freezing weather.
historically, cisterns were made underground pits lined with stone, mortar, plaster or cement; topped with a reinforced concrete roof, at grade level.
new inventive designs are using corrugated steel bins (originally fabricated for grain storage) with a plastic liner to create a water vessel.
parking lot and roadway surfaces are coated in motor oil, antifreeze, exhaust soot, and other automobile fluids.
cisterns fell out of favor in the us as water utilities provided treated potable water at extremely low cost.
the typical cistern storage capacity ranges from 500 to 10,000 gallons per cistern (1.9 m3 to 37.8 m3) ; although multiple cisterns are often interconnected in large building sites.
a typical 1,000 sq, ft. (92.9 square meters)roof can collect 624 gallons (2.4 m3) during a 1 inch (2.54 cm) rainfall, but it is seldom practical or possible to harvest and store this volume of water with rain barrels.
