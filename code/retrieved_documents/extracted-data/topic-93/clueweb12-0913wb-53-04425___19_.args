water is critical in regulating all body organs and temperature, and dissolving solids and moving nutrients throughout the body.this technologically advanced process provides one of the most proven ways to filter water.a culligan drinking water system and culligan bottled water offer two environmentally-friendly alternatives to single-serve bottled drinking water that can benefit the environment in a number of ways: clean up landfills – your entire family can use fewer single-serve bottles of water and canned drinks, preventing thousands of those single-serve bottles and cans from ending up in landfills.distilled, reverse osmosis, or deionized water or rain water are better choices for watering plants to prevent mineral accumulation in the soil .this design makes them impervious to rust and corrosion and they are uv resistant.heavy sodium or potassium salt concentrations in the absence of calcium or magnesium may affect swelling of soils and retard the growth of plants.because water is naturally low in sodium, has no fat, cholesterol or caffeine and isn't flushed straight through the body like many other beverages, it's the natural solution to help reach your body’s daily fluid quota.a water softener removes the harsh minerals commonly found in hard water, leaving you with softer, mineral-free water that is much easier and gentler on everything that uses water.appliances need less detergent and soap, which helps you save money and is better for the environment.and people may need more water as they age, since thirst signals may become dull, activity levels decline and prescription drugs may dehydrate their bodies further.the semi-permeable membrane only allows water molecules to pass through, treating the water by reducing specified contaminants3 such as arsenic v, barium, chromium and radium 226/228 and microorganisms, such as cryptosporidium and giardia.the semi-permeable membrane only allows water molecules to pass through, treating the water by reducing specified contaminants3  such as arsenic v, barium, chromium and radium 226/228 and microorganisms, such as cryptosporidium and giardia.most house plants require specific soil conditions for healthy growth.the soft, conditioned water you get from a culligan water softener system offers a number of environmentally-friendly benefits: reduces chemicals used around your house – sinks, faucets, tubs and showers come cleaner with fewer harsh chemical cleaning products.according to the water quality association, water that contains more than 1 gpg (grain per gallon) of these dissolved minerals is considered hard water.
