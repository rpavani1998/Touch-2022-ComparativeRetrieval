dr. marc gorelick, chief of pediatric emergency medicine at the medical college of wisconsin, led a group of researchers that studied the incidence of illnesses following rainfall.
based on previous usgs research, this 19 percent of wells that were discovered in this study compare with 7 percent of wells contaminated with nitrates and 1 to 2 percent for pesticides and volatile organic compounds.
however, those using private sources and wells for water should be cautious, especially when farm animals are present, as these sources typically do not have routine e. coli monitoring.
we’ve stressed the importance of conservation of karsts before as most folks do not realize that once these groundwater supplies are contaminated naturally or by human pollution, it is very difficult and expensive to reverse the condition.
these were not isolated to a couple regions, but rather found to be persistent nationwide stating, “wells with human health benchmark exceedances were widespread across the united states; they occurred in all aquifer groups and in both humid and dry regions.”
when e. coli contaminates your drinking water, one should either avoid drinking it completely, or render it safe by boiling the water or purifying it with a high quality water filter.
researchers found that the average number of emergency room visits increased by 11 percent for four days after any amount of rainfall.
ultimately what occurs is that rivers and lakes that would normally be naturally replenished begin to dry up under the high demand of urban and residential growth.
however, they also contaminate the wells indirectly by surface water runoff flowing into the underground waterway systems and ultimately finding their resting spots in karsts and water aquifers that these wells feed off of.
in more populated ares, polluted floodwater is typically an even bigger concern as it mixes and contaminates the water supplies of municipal water systems.
we’ve seen this in ny as the battle between environmentalists/homeowners and natural gas companies continues to heat up with drilling bans in place.
according to mclellan, water leaving milwaukee’s treatment plant is very high quality.
if you have determined that your drinking water is contaminated, then one of the the safest procedures is to boil your water.
if ingested, this bacteria can result in serious sickness and even death.
hurricane rain is not just unadulterated distilled water.
after all, it is monitored regularly by law.
radon gas decays into radioactive particles that can get trapped in your lungs when you breathe it.. ..radon in indoor air is the second leading cause of lung cancer.”
from there the water goes to water towers for pressure, and then to homes, schools, businesses, and the like.
extreme rainfall can deluge sewage systems, especially those systems that are called upon to manage both waste water and storm water runoff.

the american people are coping with many other personal and financial issues, and unless it makes headlines, they are unaware of the continuing destruction of our water sources thanks to human pollution.
our city not only removes these unwanted chemicals and contaminants, but also makes their own chemical additions to the water; “the water is also chlorinated for disinfection andfluoride is added for dental purposes before it is pumped into the water pipe system.”
as our lands continue to be treated with fertilizers and chemicals, in concert with continued land development, population growth, and industry pollution we experience an ever increasing trickling of chemical waste into our groundwater systems and waterways.
as a result, an increased amount of contaminants and health effecting trace minerals have seeped into these wells unnoticed.
basically, the longer the water has been in contact with the aquifer, the more chemically evolved it is deemed to be and thus the greater concentrations of these trace minerals, some of which are harmful to the body such as arsenic and radon.
for the first time a national study has been conducted testing for potential trace contaminants in wells and aquifers.

when private drinking water wells were removed from the data set, it was found that a surprising 13 percent of all private wells exceeded the health standards or guidelines.
all the while, most residents are completely unaware that their valuable water resources are being increasingly contaminated while also slowly diminishing in availability.
with all of these conditions persisting, it’s no wonder that public concerned interest in our water resources and drinking water quality is exponentially rising.
it highlights failures and obvious enforcement gaps in current government regulations that we’ve assumed are protecting our drinking water, including the realization that 20 percent of the nation’s water treatment systems have violated key provisions of the safe drinking water act.

he states, “we often get more upset about these anthropogenic contaminants but we have to remember that these naturally occurring elements are often times more of a widespread problem.
however, keeping facilities manned, maintained and up to date is not cheap and requires substantial taxpayer dollars.
this can also be an issue after rainfall saturates the surrounding soil, allowing contaminated water to leach into the piping system.
not to diminish the importance of the others, but trace elements are also hugely important and arguably more so.”
“the water well contamination fine is the largest single penalty dep has ever assessed against an oil and gas operator, and the avella tank fire penalty is the highest we could assess under the oil and gas act,” said mike krancer, who heads the state agency.
with the ability to remove e. coli bacteria to a log 7 degree, or 99.99999%, theberkey water filter will render contaminated drinking water safe to drink.
now, this more toxic soup of water runoff either saturates the surrounding land or gets routed through community sewer systems to water treatment plants where industrial filtration attempts to make it drinkable.
