since they don't like the cold, i don't think they would like it if you watered with cool water.
because the plants should be kept cool  for much of the time during their dormancy, it is best to allow the growing  medium to become almost dry before watering again.
you might want to try repotting into new, clean media and water with distilled water only for a month or so to see if the plants recover.
feel free to ask questions like this in the forum!

seed kits aren't very good to try for a first timer.

because it's summer time i of course keep my door and windows wide open, but i usually do not see any flies or bugs in my appartment - will it die without food?
i've had it for a decent 4 months and it seems to be doing really well up to now.
~teen just got my seeds!
yes, you can use shallower pots.
it is especially important during theirdormancy to avoid wet conditions when it  is very cool or cold at the same time.

hi there, just got my seeds, i've put the pot of soil (correct soil i was given with the seeds) in a tray of rain water untill the top soil is wet / damp, now it's time to put the seeds in!
rain water written by lftal_81, may 16, 2010 hi all.
although higher levels of tds can be tolerated (up to 100 ppm (parts per million)) or so, in that case the growing medium would need to be flushed occasionally by watering several times over a period of several hours or perhaps a day, and the plants may benefit from repotting (changing the growing medium) once per year or so.
to prevent stagnation, can i choose not to place my flytrap on a bowl with water on it and just use a spray bottle to spray some water at the plant?

otherwise, if the plant and growing medium can be monitored, it is best to  water and then allow the medium to dry until just moist before watering again.
if i have flytraps in a terrarium - is the natural condensation which forms enough to keep the plants healthy or should i water as well?

however, the tray method is often not a good method to use all  the time (see the paragraph above).
do i sprinkle the seeds on the top or make a little hole and plant them then cover it over?
in any case, your seeds might need longer to germinate, or they might never germinate.
although higher levels of tds can be tolerated (up to 100  ppm (parts per million)) or so, in that case the growing medium would need to  be flushed occasionally by watering several times over a period of several  hours or perhaps a day, and the plants may benefit from repotting (changing the  growing medium) once per year or so.

however regarding tap or well water, if one measures the water with a tds (total dissolved solids) meter which indicates a tds measurement of less than 50 ppm (parts per million), it is safe to use for venus flytraps and other carnivorous plants.
one way to water a venus flytrap is the tray method.
otherwise, if the plant and growing medium can be monitored, it is best to water and then allow the medium to dry until just moist before watering again.
but i think that made it worse!

the tray method works well when plants are actively growing, are in lots of direct sunlight, and the weather is warm, or during vacations when one is not able to check one's plants.

written by matt, february 12, 2009 scott, you'll find tons of information on this in the forum, but basically you just sprinkle the seeds on top of the peat moss and keep them very moist until they germinate then you put them in a sunny windowsill to continue growing.
there are tons of people hear that would love to hear about your plants.
is this ok or does sterilized water still contain impurities?
2) how oftern do you water them?
standing water can be detrimental to the venus flytrap.

boiling the water increases the amount of dissolved solids by making the clean water evaporate.

venus fly traps and all other carnivorous plants should only be watered with distilled water, rain water, reverse osmosis water (from an ro system).
trim off the traps that die.

re: snow! written by matt, february 06, 2009 yep, clean snow will work great for your flytrap!

for questions, you'll get better responses if you ask them in the forum.

so as it said, i put the seeds in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for 3 weeks and then planted them in a pot with a sand/acidic soil mixture.
i currently put in a cap's measurement (the cap from the arrowhead bottle) of arrowhead before reading the information on the website.
bring your vft's inside during this time.
it depends on what method you are using to collect it.
any type of ground water will usually have a lot of dissolved solids in it, which can accumulate in the media and poison your plant.
question: is it ok for me to put my fly trap under a lamp next to a window?
i'm sure there is a section in this website that talks about it.
in  general, tap water is not a good idea.

if you feed it never ever give it anything it could not catch itself in the swamp.
and i currently use this "pur" water filtration pitcher.
or could i use bottled table water for her?
yes, if you are talking about using the water from the freezer, that should be fine to use.
my town has no public water source whatsoever.
overwatering often leads to sudden death; therefore it is best to keep the soil moist, but never wet.

no, never use fertilised soil.

avoid collecting water from at least the firs 3-4 downpours since this rain is usually very acidic and contains high amounts of solids.
