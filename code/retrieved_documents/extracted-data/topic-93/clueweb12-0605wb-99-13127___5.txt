impervious areas also mean that water that  would have otherwise been absorbed into the ground and gradually seeped back  into our streams over a period of days, now flows straight through our stream  system in the course of hours, many times causing flooding.

since one inch of rainfall provides approximately 600 gallons of water for a 1,000 sq. ft catchment area, you could collect 1200 gallons during a 1” rain.
this stored  water then becomes a great alternative to tap/city water and can be used during  periods of dry or drought to water gardens, trees, and other plants.
for this reason, plants respond very well to rainwater.
and tipping is a risk if it is unsecured or onuneven ground.
