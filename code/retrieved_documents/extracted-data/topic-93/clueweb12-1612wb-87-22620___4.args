potable water: water that is safe to drink after the raw water has gone through the filtration and treatment process.
you can use them to learn new words as you read the educational stories on this web site.
intake: the part of a surface water treatment facility where water from a lake, river or stream is drawn into the plant for filtration, treatment and distribution to customers.
back to top drought: a period of lower-than-normal precipitation that can lead to a water shortage.
recharge area: an area of land that allows rainwater to percolate into the earth's surface to replenish groundwater sources.
transpiration: the process by which plants produce water vapor which is released into the atmosphere.
the process by which substances are added to the water in order to make it safe to drink or look and taste better.
water meter: a device that records the amount of water being used in your home.
chlorine: one of the most common chemicals used in the treatment of public water supplies because it is highly effective in killing harmful microorganisms.
your water utility checks your water meter regularly because your water bill is based on how much water you use.
aquifer: an underground rock formation that can hold water.

your water utility checks your water meter regularly because your water bill is based on how much water you use.
hardness: the texture of water that contains high levels of harmless metals such as magnesium and calcium.
contamination can occur naturally or by the hands of humans.
acid rain: rain water that has a lower ph (acidic) as a result of sulfur gases being released into the atmosphere from the burning of coal, gasoline and other fossil fuels.
back to top drought: a period of lower-than-normal precipitation that can lead to a water shortage.
well: a deep hole in the ground that is dug in order to gain access to groundwater sources.

sometimes a reservoir will be open, like a man-made lake, or it may be a fully enclosed tank, either above-ground or underground.
after a period of rain, snow, sleet or hail, water will flow through soil and rock to reach underground aquifers.
the process by which substances are added to the water in order to make it safe to drink or look and taste better.
precipitation: any form of water falling from clouds down to earth, which replenishes water supplies.
back to top percolation: the process by which precipitation replenishes groundwater sources.
an older home containing lead pipes could contribute to increased lead levels in the home's tap water.
water main: the underground pipe used to transport potable water from a water utility to your home.
well: a deep hole in the ground that is dug in order to gain access to groundwater sources.

potable water: water that is safe to drink after the raw water has gone through the filtration and treatment process.
recharge: the increase in groundwater levels after rainwater soaks into the ground and into an aquifer.
the process by which chlorine is added to water during treatment in order to kill harmful microorganisms.
raw water: the water from a surface water or groundwater source prior to filtration or treatment.
after a period of rain, snow, sleet or hail, water will flow through soil and rock to reach underground aquifers.
this is the natural cycle of water, including evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation and percolation.
recharge: the increase in groundwater levels after rainwater soaks into the ground and into an aquifer.
transpiration: the process by which plants produce water vapor which is released into the atmosphere.
conservation: methods of using water wisely with the minimum amount of water being wasted.

the term called "hard water" is used because it's "hard" to get lather from soap and shampoo when using this water.
a device used within the home to reduce the hardness of the water.

raw water: the water from a surface water or groundwater source prior to filtration or treatment.
surface water: any source of water that is found on top of the earth's surface, such as a lake, river or stream.
chlorine: one of the most common chemicals used in the treatment of public water supplies because it is highly effective in killing harmful microorganisms.
any source of water that is found beneath the earth's surface in an aquifer.
this is an area of land that allows rainwater to flow into creeks, streams and rivers.
the process by which water from the earth's surface is transported into the atmosphere as it turns from liquid to gas.

contaminant: any substance found in water that may be harmful to water consumers.
lead: a metal that is harmful to infants and children if swallowed.
