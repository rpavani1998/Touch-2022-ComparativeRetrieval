distilled water cleanses the body through promoting healthy kidney function.distilled water does not leach out significant amounts of biologically available minerals because these are quickly taken up by the body on an as needed basis.this point of view is that water should be mineralized in order to have health benefits and that distilled water somehow leaches out minerals from the body.as to carbon filtered and reverse osmosis water, these are better solutions than tap water or mineral water, however they still fall far short of the standard set by distilled water.it does not cause mineral loss but in fact takes out harmful toxins from the body.however, rain water is no longer pure due to atmospheric pollution.the minerals it leaches out are of the unusable, ionic form and we want these to leave the body rather than be deposited and cause disease.carbon based molecules are to be found in living systems, and are not found in the ground which is where mineral water comes from.minerals are present in the ground and must be biologically bound in order to be used by the body.the purpose of water is to cleanse the body.carbonate is not a sufficiently complex organic molecule and therefore cannot properly contribute its calcium to living systems.nature knows best and nature supplies distilled water in the form of rain.if they are present in excess then they are filtered through the kidneys and this is exactly what needs to happen with all things which are in excess in the circulation.if you want cataracts, kidney stones, and arteriosclerosis, be sure to eat and drink “calcium enriched” foods.common locations for precipitation of calcium are the lens of the eye (cataracts), the kidneys (kidney stones) and the walls of arteries (arteriosclerosis).
