reverse osmosis, which forces water through a selectively-permeable membrane, is theoretically the best technology for purification, and companies like aquafina and dasani use it in their plants.$6 billion of the stimulus package was set aside for local clean and drinking water infrastructure improvements, which have been neglected for far too long.however, it is also the most energy-intensive form of purification, and is no real guarantee of quality since the membranes themselves are susceptible to bacterial colonization.in past decades fijian farmers have starved because there wasn’t enough water for irrigation, which calls into question the wisdom of shipping fijian water overseas to be sold as a luxury item.and bottled water, unlike constantly moving municipal water, is stagnant, and therefore more conducive to bacterial replication.the study, published in the february 2009 peer-reviewed environmental research letters, finds that bottled water takes *up to 2000 times more energy* to produce than drinking water from the tap.the company has promised to reduce its emissions and packaging, use more renewable energy, and use carbon offsets, as well as protect their source’s watershed, the sovi basin rainforest.in the long run, we can’t afford the bottled water solution socially, environmentally, or economically.fiji can’t realistically claim to be any more environmentally responsible than companies who transport water a shorter distance.food and water watch in their aggressive anti-bottled water and anti-water privatization campaign, point out that quality testing standards are far less stringent for bottled water than for municipal supplies.for example, whereas municipal water must be tested for fecal coliform bacteria 100 times per month, a little over 3 times a day, bottled water plants only have to check once a week.otherwise, we will be increasingly forced to drink water that isn’t significantly safer, but still costs us more than gasoline.but considering the environmental costs of producing bottled water, the fact that there is no proven health benefit to drinking it makes it even crazier to choose bottled water over tap.“we are proud to offer a fine artesian water that is good for people and good for the environment,” they say.americans spent $11 billion on bottled water in 2006, and drank over 33 billion liters in 2007, which works out to about 30 gallons per person.
