the rainfall in the sierra may not have even reached the water sources constituting the tap water tested; for example, the recent rains may still be unmelted snow; 2.
bottom line, depending on where your water comes from, you could be getting water that is closer to the rain water than the drinking water figures here.
i use solar power and rainwater for a lot of my h2o needs.

thanks ucb for this data and your hard work.
sources of tap water vs. rainwater submitted by anonymous on tue, 2011-04-05 11:44 berkeley radiological air and water monitoring forum first, great appreciation to the staff for all your work in keeping the public informed.
regarding the validity of tap water measurements: as best i can determine, ucb gets it's tap water from ebmud, which gets its water from sources far from berkeley.
although inconvenient, a more valid comparison would be to take samples from local reservoirs (marin county has several) to compare to air/rainfall.
i just feel that discarding the highest measurement, the one found in rainwater to be flip.

what about sludge that is collected from water treatment plants after a rain.

many communities in the bay area, from the central valley and walnut creek to mill valley to san jose do not get their water from the far away frozen sierras.
the rainfall a hundred or more miles away may not have the same content as that in berkeley.
this raises a couple of problems in comparing berkeley rain water with tap water.

the amount of dilution is impossible to tell, as there may be a delay in transport (water "in the pipeline"); and 3.

i don't see diatribes or conspiratorial rants.
i am a little confused by the update today as well where you state that tap water is what we should be focusing on.
or at least acknowledge that there is a disconnect between local rainwater measurements and distant tap water measurements.
i was lulled into a faulse sense of security by the numbers reported here.
taking one sample from one location can be very misleading.

my area has a lake/reservoir system that was mostly recarged by the recent heavy rains.
