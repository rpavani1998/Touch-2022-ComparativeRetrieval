every year, our water is tested more than 100,000 times to ensure that it meets or exceeds every standard for safe drinking water.so it is clear that bottled water directly adds to environmental degradation, global warming and a large amount of unnecessary waste and litter.more than 1 billion plastic water bottles end up in the california's trash each year, taking up valuable landfill space, leaking toxic additives, such as phthalates, into the groundwater and taking 1,000 years to biodegrade.the rapid growth in the bottled water industry means that water extraction is concentrated in communities where bottling plants are located.near mount shasta, the world's largest food company, nestle, is proposing to extract billions of gallons of spring water, which could have devastating impacts on the mccloud river.our water generates clean energy on its way to our tap -- powering our streetcars, fire stations, the airport and schools.this can have a huge strain on the surrounding eco-system.transporting bottled water by boat, truck and train involves burning massive quantities of fossil fuels.that means bottled water may be harming our future water supply.just supplying americans with plastic water bottles for one year consumes more than 47 million gallons of oil, enough to take 100,000 cars off the road and 1 billion pounds of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, according tothe container recycling institute.in contrast, san francisco tap water is distributed through an existing zero-carbon infrastructure: plumbing and gravity.at home and in your car, switch to a stainless steel water bottle and use it for the rest of your life knowing that you are drinking some of the nation's best water and making the planet a better place.here in san francisco, we can buy water from fiji (5,455 miles away) or norway (5,194 miles away) and many other faraway places to satisfy our demand for the chic and exotic.the real cost of bottled water jared blumenfeld, susan leal san franciscans and other bay area residents enjoy some of the nation's highest quality drinking water, with pristine sierra snowmelt from the hetch hetchy reservoir as our primary source.as further proof that the bottle is worth more than the water in it, starting in 2007, the state of california will give 5 cents for recycling a small water bottle and 10 cents for a large one.
