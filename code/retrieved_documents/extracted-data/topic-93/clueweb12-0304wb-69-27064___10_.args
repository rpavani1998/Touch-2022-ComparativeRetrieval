as the 1999 nrdc report notes, bottled water may be useful temporarily when tap water is contaminated; "in the long run, however, it is far better from an economic, environmental and public health point of view to improve public drinking water supplies than it is to have a massive societal shift from consumer use of tap water to use of bottled water.this switch is setting the stage for corporations to profit from taking over control of public water supplies.this, despite the fact that tap water, with very few exceptions, is a safe form of drinking water in canada and the united states."the bottled-water industry's marketing of 'safe, clean water' undermines citizen's confidence in public water systems, and paves the way for the water companies to take over underfunded local utilities."several peer-reviewed scientific studies have found disturbing concentrations of toxic ingredients such as arsenic and mercury in their bottled-water samplings," warns clarke, who adds that "bottling plants face inspections only once every three-to-six years depending on the country, and regulations governing tap water are often stricter than those governing bottled water."these containers release highly dangerous toxic chemicals and contaminants into the air and water when they are manufactured, and again when they are burned or buried."the industry's treatment processes do not guarantee that bottled water is safer than tap water; in fact, a number of studies have demonstrated that bottled water is often less safe than tap water," says the report."unlike other raw materials such as timber, minerals, oil and gas, which are transformed into identifiably new products, bottled water is simply water transformed into water [emphasis in original].clarke calls the price markup on bottled water "astonishing," considering that coca-cola and pepsi "draw the water for their products directly from municipal taps."hence contamination is also a concern.which means coca-cola is charging the same price for water as it is for water-based products that have considerable value added.in return, public willingness to pay premium prices for bottled water enables water-service corporations to establish a top-dollar price," warns clarke.according to clarke, a 1999 study by the u.s.-based natural resources defense council, titled "bottled water: pure drink or pure hype?," estimates that "bottled water is between 240 and 10,000 times more expensive than tap water."inside the bottle," downloadable from the internet, offers a close-up look at this mirage, and how the big four drinks companies in north america -- coca-cola, pepsi, nestle and danone (dannon in the u.s.) -- are getting rich selling water taken from public water supplies -- and convincing us that we are better off buying what once was ours for free.hence they inevitably ought to cost more to produce than filtered tap water.
