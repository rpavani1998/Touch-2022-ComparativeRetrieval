â€¢ use only as much water as you require.
for an average rainfall of 1,000mm, approximately four million litres of rainwater can be collected in a year in an acre of land (4,047 m2), post-evaporation.

do not leave the taps running while washing dishes and clothes.
while brushing or other use, do not leave the tap running, open it only when you require it.
â€¢ use a washing machine that does not consume too much water.
in saline or coastal areas & islands, rain water provides good quality water city/town summary population  3,64,523 (as per 2001 census) area  68.63  sq.
rain water harvesting water conservation â€¢ important step for solutions to issues of water and environmental conservation is to change people's attitudes and habits â€¢ conserve water because it is right thing to do!.
see that there are no leaking taps.
â€¢ install small shower heads to reduce the flow of the water.
â€¢ as rwh - neither energy-intensive nor labour-intensive â€¢ it can be a cost-effective alternative to other water-accruing methods.
