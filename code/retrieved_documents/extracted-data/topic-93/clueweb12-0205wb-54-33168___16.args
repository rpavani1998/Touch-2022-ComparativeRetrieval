in addition, nrdc commissioned independent lab testing of more than 1,000 bottles of 103 types of bottled water from many parts of the country (california, the district of columbia, florida, illinois, new york, and texas).
for example, unlike fda's rules, the european union's (eu's) bottled natural mineral water standards regulate total bacteria count, and explicitly ban all parasites and pathogenic microorganisms,e. coli or other coliform bacteria, fecal streptococci (e.g.,streptococcus faecalis, recently renamedenterococcus faecalis), pseudomonas aeruginosa, and sporulated sulphite-reducing anaerobic bacteria.
the labs tested most waters for about half of the drinking water contaminants regulated by fda (to control costs).
though usually limited in scope, these studies also have found that most bottled water meets applicable enforceable standards, but that a minority of waters contain chemical or microbiological contaminants of potential concern.
they found: - nearly one in four of the waters tested (23 of the 103 waters, or 22 percent) violated strict applicable state (california) limits for bottled water in at least one sample, most commonly for arsenic or certain cancer-causing man-made ("synthetic") organic compounds.
- for purposes of comparison, we note that epa recently reported that in 1996 about 1 in 10 community tap water systems (serving about one seventh of the u.s. population) violated epa's tap water treatment or contaminant standards, and 28 percent of tap water systems violated significant water-monitoring or reporting requirements.

if fda fails within 18 months to make its bottled water rules and its regulatory oversight and enforcement at least as stringent as those for tap water, the bottled water regulatory program and funding for it (including the proceeds from a penny-per-bottle fee) should be transferred to epa.
manufacture and shipping of billions of bottles causes unnecessary energy and petroleum consumption, leads to landfilling or incineration of bottles, and can release environmental toxins.

while most bottled water apparently is of good quality, publicly available monitoring data are scarce.
therefore, while much tap water is indeed risky, having compared available data we conclude that there is no assurance that bottled water is any safer than tap water.
we were unable to test for many microbial contaminants, such ascryptosporidium, because the logistics and cost of testing for them post-bottling were beyond our means.
- city water systems must issue annual "right-to-know" reports telling consumers what is in their water; as detailed in this report, bottlers successfully killed such a requirement for bottled water.
other academic and government bottled water surveys generally are consistent with the testing nrdc commissioned.
fda says bottled water is a low priority; the agency estimates it has the equivalent of fewer than one staff person dedicated to developing and issuing bottled water rules, and the equivalent offewer than one fda staffer assuring compliance with the bottled water rules on the books.
they found: nearly one in four of the waters tested (23 of the 103 waters, or 22 percent) violated strict applicable state (california) limits for bottled water in at least one sample, most commonly for arsenic or certain cancer-causing man-made ("synthetic") organic compounds.
in addition, many waters contained arsenic, nitrates, or other inorganic contaminants at levels below current standards.
a major shift to bottled water could undermine funding for tap water protection, raising serious equity issues for the poor.
one sample contained phthalate – a carcinogen that leaches from plastic – at a level twice the tap water standard, but there is no bottled water standard for this chemical; two other samples from different batches of this same water contained no detectable phthalate.
thus, while much tap water is supplied by systems that have violated epa standards or that serve water containing substantial levels of risky contaminants, apparently the majority of the country's tap water passes epa standards.
by comparison, hundreds of federal staff and many more state personnel are dedicated to tap water regulation.

fda and state bottled water programs are seriously underfunded.
- repeated high levels of bacteria (i.e., "heterotrophic-plate-count" bacteria) in tap water combined with a lack of disinfectant can trigger a violation for cities -- but not for water bottlers.

repeated high levels of bacteria (i.e., "heterotrophic-plate-count" bacteria) in tap water combined with a lack of disinfectant can trigger a violation for cities -- but not for water bottlers.
any violation of tap-water standards is grounds for enforcement – but bottled water in violation of standards can still be sold if it is labeled as "containing excessive chemicals" or "excessive bacteria" (unless fda finds it "adulterated," a term not specifically defined).
four waters (4 percent) violated the generally weak federal bottled water standards (two for excessive fluoride and two for excessive coliform bacteria); neither of the two latter waters were found to be contaminated with coliform bacteria in our testing of a different lot of the same brand.
one sample contained phthalate – a carcinogen that leaches from plastic – at a level twice the tap water standard, but there is no bottled water standard for this chemical; two other samples from different batches of this same water contained no detectable phthalate.
recommendations every american has a right to safe, good-tasting water from the tap.
- nearly one in five tested waters (18 of the 103, or 17 percent) contained, in at least one sample, more bacteria than allowed under microbiological-purity "guidelines" (unenforceable sanitation guidelines based on heterotrophic plate count [hpc] bacteria levels in the water) adopted by some states, the industry, and the eu.
clearly epa has more resources dedicated to drinking water and has adopted stricter rules and oversight of state programs than fda has.

- a credible independent third-party-nongovernmental organization should establish a "certified safe" bottled water program that is truly open, ensures full compliance with all fda, epa, state, industry, and international standards and guidelines, does twice-a-year surprise inspections, documents sufficient source protection and treatment to meet epa/centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) criteria forcryptosporidium-safe bottled water, and makes readily available (including on the web) all inspections and monitoring results.
most cities using surface water have had to test for cryptosporidium orgiardia, two common water pathogens that can cause diarrhea and other intestinal problems (or more serious problems in vulnerable people), yet bottled water companies don't have to do this.
for example, one brand of "spring water," whose label pictured a lake and mountains, actually came from a well in an industrial facility's parking lot that was near a hazardous waste dump and periodically was contaminated with industrial chemicals at levels above fda standards.

fda's standards for certain chemicals (such as arsenic) are weaker than certain world health organization (who) guidelines.
major regulatory gaps - fda's rules completely exempt 60-70 percent of the bottled water sold in the united states from the agency's bottled water standards, because fda says its rules do not apply to water packaged and sold within the same state.
- about one fifth of the waters contained synthetic organic chemicals – such as industrial chemicals (e.g., toluene or xylene) or chemicals used in manufacturing plastic (e.g., phthalate, adipate, or styrene) – in at least one sample, but generally at levels below state and federal standards.
in addition, the tap water of more than 32 million americans (and perhaps more) exceeds 2 parts per billion (ppb) arsenic (the california proposition 65 warning level, applicable to bottled water, is 5 ppb); and 80 to 100 million americans drink tap water that contains very significant trihalomethane levels (over 40 ppb).
- some of this marketing is misleading, implying the water comes from pristine sources when it does not.
another three waters sold outside of california (3 percent of the national total) violated industry-recommended standards for synthetic organic compounds in at least one sample; but, unlike in california, those industry standards were not enforceable in the states (florida and texas) in which they were sold.
bottled water sometimes is contaminated, and we don't use it to bathe, shower, etc. – major routes of exposure for some tap water contaminants.
