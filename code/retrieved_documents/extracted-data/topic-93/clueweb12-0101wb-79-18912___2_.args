bottled water sales are driven in part by marketing strategies that tout bottled water as cleaner and safer to drink than tap water.short term exposure to high levels of lead can interfere with normal development in babies and young children, and may cause slight increases in the blood pressure of some adults.the centers for disease control (cdc) estimates that access to fluoridated tap water reduces incidence of tooth decay from 18 to 40 percent.because lead leaches into water by the corrosion of lead pipes in homes, utilities control lead levels by reducing the corrosiveness of water.water that meets these standards is safe to drink, although people with severely compromised immune systems and children may have special needs.as a result, studies have found that trace amounts of these compounds are turning up in our nation's water bodies, and potentially, in our drinking water.the effects of long-term exposure to elevated levels are more serious, and may include stroke, kidney disease, and cancer.fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that when consumed at the recommended level, helps prevent tooth decay in children and adults.if the lead levels are higher than 15 parts per billion (ppb) in more than 10% of the homes sampled, then the utility must take certain actions, including public notification, and efforts to reduce the corrosiveness of water.a blood test can screen a child for lead poisoning.the epa estimates that 20% of human exposure to lead is attributable to drinking water.boiling water for at least one minute is effective at sterilizing water against bacteria.while fluoride occurs naturally in some water sources, in many communities, such as charleston, it’s also added during the water treatment process.the optimal concentration of fluoride, as recommended by the cdc and us department of health and human services (hhs), is 0.7 parts per million (ppm).the optimal concentration of fluoride, as recommended by the cdc and us department of health and human services (hhs), is 0.7 parts per million (ppm).
