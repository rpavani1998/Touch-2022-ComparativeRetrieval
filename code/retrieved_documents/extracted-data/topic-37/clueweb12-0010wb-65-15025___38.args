the game's author has probably seen people with your exact same problem many times over and might put information specific to that game on the website.
linux gaming news linux meta gaming site for german speaking folk.
it runs under x at any color depth, and supports changeable memory sizes, joysticks, and sound.
when an operating system wants to write to a hard drive, it communicates through a device driver that interfaces directly with the hardware device memory.
smart engines calculate what portions of objects will be obscured by objects above them and simply not render the portions that you won't see anyhow.
first, svgalib executables need to be run by root or be setuid root, however, the library releases root status immediately after the executable begins to run.
graphical adventures graphical adventures are, at heart, text adventures on steroids.
these games can be played usingsarienon> , an open source interpreter for agi games.
despite the authors being a bit surly, their effort with the faq is very good.
this method works for libraries too.
since the open sound system's (oss) deprecation in favour of alsa, all linux distributions i've seen now ship with alsa support as default, with oss support actually being supplied via alsa's compatability modules.
more violent than quake.
and again like the rush, it wasn't popular.
many modern 3d accelerated cards have a z buffer in their video ram, which speeds things up considerably, but z buffering can also be done by the application's rendering engine.
ludvig strigeus was able to reverse engineer the scumm format and write an interpreter for scumm based games that compiles under linux and win32 named scummvm .
whether you're trying to diagnose an x problem or requesting help from a mailing list or usenet newsgroup, you'll want to have as much information available as possible.
now if your goal is to run win95 type os games under linux, win4lin almost seems better than vmware.
fsaa: full screen anti-aliasing fsaa usually involves drawing a magnified version of the entire screen in a separate framebuffer, performing aa on the entire image and rescaling it back to the normal resolution.
game reviewers agree that this game has the features of quake with a story-line more compelling than half-life.
at its lowest level, it provides a platform independent (as much as that is possible in c++) way of dealing with display, sound, input, networking, files, threading and such.
gcc will then `place a memo inside the executable' that says to look at the files /usr/lib/libsdl.so and /lib/libm.so.3 whenever an sdl or math function is used.
svgalib is a graphics library that lets you draw graphics on the console.
the first step is to make your system allow unlimited coresizes: ulimit -c unlimited you will now have to recompile the program and pass the -g option to gcc (explaining this is beyond the scope of this document).
very useful when a google group search yields a page in german which looks useful and my wife (who reads german well) isn't around.
when an operating system wants to write to a hard drive, it communicates through a device driver that interfaces directly with the hardware device memory.
3dfx removed the multi-texturing unit from the rush, and it was outperformed by the voodoo i.
in ultima ii, you destroy the evil sorceress minax.
for instance, when you magnify a picture, you'll notice lines that were once smooth become jagged (try it with the gimp).
i hate howto's that include the license; it's a tree killer.
strace tells you what system calls are being made, with what arguments, and what their return values are.
while it's not officially certified (that would take more money than an open source project has), it's an almost fully compliant opengl implementation conforming to the arb specifications.
you can get mesademos with debian ( apt-get install mesademos) or you can hunt for the rpm on http://www.rpmfind.net.
the show-stopper is the fact that vmware has limited directx support while win4lin has none.
if the game segfaults every time you run it, or is incredibly slow, a saved game file won't be of much help.
this is a way of adding to the linkers search path.
however, it's a great diagnostic tool also.
they have an extremely high "information to space" ratio.
it's an absolute show stopper for gaming.
frankly, i've had many cards and i can't tell the difference between any of them for gaming.
locked system when a computer "locks", also called "hung", the keyboard and mouse become completely unresponsive.
my personal recommendation is any card which has the es1370 or es1371 chip, which uses the es1370 and es1371 sound drivers on linux.
simulations strive to immerse the player behind the controls of something they normally wouldn't have access to.
dumb engines draw far objects first and close objects last, obscuring objects below them in the z buffer.
multimedia api's are more centralized on windows than they are on linux.
if your goal is to run win95/98/me applications on linux, without usb and on the x86 architecture, win4lin's cost and focus on win95 type os's make it a better choice than vmware.
computer based board games simulate some kind of board game you'd play on a table top with friends, like monopoly, mille bourne, chess or checkers.
but if you're going to give it a try, you're more likely to have success with vmware.
once upon a time, soundcards without onboard midi chips (most pci sound cards) didn't do midi.
the developers take wine (see section 10.5.1) and add directx / directdraw support.
when you use a voodoo iii, iv or v under xfree86 4.x, you want to use a version of mesa (seesection 3.4) which was compiled to use glide3 as a backend to ensure hardware accelerated opengl on your system.
in addition, there isn't an evaluation copy available, although you get a 30 day money back guarantee.
he recently released a new game (a linux version is not available) but since the decline of adventuring, he has pretty much kept out of the gaming industry.
however, the original data files are kept proprietary.
when you use a voodoo iii, iv or v under xfree86 4.x, you want to use a version of mesa (seesection 3.4) which was compiled to use glide3 as a backend to ensure hardware accelerated opengl on your system.
because of the nature of the vm, the foreign os can't tell the difference between operating in a vm or in a "real" machine.
gcc will then `bolt on' code from/usr/lib/sdl.a and /usr/lib/libm.a whenever it sees a math function during the compilation process.
if something is already accessing your card, other applications won't be able to.
a good example would be heavy gear iii or flight gear.
there are some real classics that were written for dos like carmageddon, redneck rampage and tomb raider.
$@ this script sets up some environment variables, then launches the game binary with whatever command line options we added.
if you can't, ssh in from a another machine.
by the word "best" i mean best for gaming.
each interpreter has its own set of strengths, and you can find links to them on the home pages for frotz and jzip.
although some games may work with wine, you'll probably get the most success with winex: its directx support is constantly improving.
for this howto, we'll assume that you're more of a gamer than a studio recording engineer.
wabi does not do dos itself, but it looks like it can use a dos emulator as a backend for running dos programs.
kegs boots all apple ii variants, and supports all of the apple ]['s graphics modes.
getting information about your x system whether you're trying to diagnose an x problem or requesting help from a mailing list or usenet newsgroup, you'll want to have as much information available as possible.
using scottfree and any of the scott adams data files which can be downloaded from scott's website you can enjoy these classics.
on the other hand, you can ask for help and the developers are very good about getting around to your answer; their vigilance is quite impressive.
beyond the 9200, you need to use ati's binary only proprietary drivers, available in rpm format from ati's website.
for example, if you have a voodoo i, ii or iii card under xfree86 3.x, you'd use mesa+glide2 (written by david bucciarelli) which is the mesa implementation of opengl that uses glide2 as a backend to render for graphical operations.
if the page is not in a language you can understand, there are many translation sites which will convert the text into whatever language you like, including http://www.freetranslation.com and http://translation.lycos.com.
pci cards can share interrupts, but certain types of high bandwidth cards simply don't like to share, including network and sound cards.
when it wants to set an irq, give it some bogus instructions that lets it think it set an irq.
the components of directx are: directdraw gives direct access to video memory, like dri, so 2d graphics can be blitted directly to the video card.
if the sound card works when you're root but not any other user, you probably have a permissions problem.
even when an ati offering is better than the current geforce offering for windows, the card is always trounced by geforce on linux.
a few seconds later, hit alt-sysrq-u. this will attempt to remount all your mounted filesystems as read-only).
but at high resolutions, the performance hit may be enormous.

if for some reason you're using x 3.3, follow the instructions given by mtrr.txt (see section 5.1) to set up your mtrrs.
the first adventure game was adventure (actually “advent”, written on a pdp-1 in 1972).
you're still supposed to shutdown in an orderly manner, but the filesystem integrity will be maintained.
this means that when you get opengl from sgi, if you want any kind of hardware acceleration at all, it must be opengl written and compiled specifically for some graphics card.
the data files are the actual game itself, similar to the relationship between first person shooters (section 2.7) and wad files.
i'm not entirely sure of the quality of these open source drivers, however, soldier of fortune i and heavy metal still have opaque texture problems under first generation radeons.
it has support from nvidia (nforce2/3 based motherboards come with openal ms windows libraries for the on-board audio), apple has added openal to their audio framework for osx and it can also be found powering the epic games unreal engine
the console was hosed with a quasi-graphics screen.
since sound is crucial for me, i always compile sound into my kernels.
in the example above, we can see that nwmain wants libmss.so.6, and the linker cannot find it.
this is why a game can easily take out a windows system but should not take down a linux system.
directaudio directaudio is a combination of 2 audio api's, directsound and directmusic, which allows direct access to the sound card for sound and music playback.
this presents a problem for companies like transgaming ( section 10.5.3) and prompted a fork of wine called rewind (section 10.5.2).
this document is a stepping stone to get the most common problems resolved and to give people the knowledge to begin thinking intelligently about what is going on with their games.
on paper, it's simply the more impressive card.
it'll tell you things like screen and window resolution, color depth, window gravity state (which gives a hint to the window manager about where to place new windows), backing store usage and more.
the lock can also be a "soft lock", meaning that the kernel is still functioning in some capacity.
for instance, i can browse loki software's news server with tin -g news.lokigames.com.
aa can be done either by the application itself (as with the gimp or the xfree86 font system) or by hardware, if your video card supports it.
any game-supplied copy of a library such as openal or sdl is likely to be compiled for the lowest common denominator, probably i486 or i686.
id software's open sourced the doom codebase and ported quake i to linux (december 1996).
you can play ultima vii under linux with exult (section 11.7).
when bad things happen to good people of course we can't cover every bad thing that happens, but i'll outline some items of common sense.
wine has come a long way, and is capable of emulating many important programs, which is great news for linux users who want this sort of stuff.
fortunately, we have more emulators than you can shake a stick at.
unreal engine currently, it's not all cross-platform goodness.
so if you don't see your sound card's driver with lsmod, your card probably isn't configured yet.
in march 1998, 3dfx released their voodoo ii, with its 3.6gb/sec memory bandwith, 12mb of video memory and 90mhz core.
the best tool to use here is lsof, which shows which processes are accessing a file.

have everything under the sun compiled as a module and try to load them all.
card reviews claim that it has some serious heat, noise, and dust issues.
for example, i added the users p and wellspring to group audio on my system: audio:x:29:p,wellspring don't forget to use grpconv if you use shadow passwords (which should be the case on most recent distributions) in order to maintain a consistent group configuration.
we were getting our first tastes of real commercial gaming.
smart engines calculate what portions of objects will be obscured by objects above them and simply not render the portions that you won't see anyhow.
openal aims to be for sound what opengl is for graphics.
to find out what libraries a game uses, we can use the "ldd" command.
later on, the sophisticated graphical adventures had your character roaming around the screen, and you could even use a mouse, but the interface remained purely text.
when it wants to access a hard drive, give it some memory to write to.
all modern 3d accelerated video cards can do bilinear filtering in hardware with no performance hit.
about libraries on linux a common problem you'll see in gaming is a library file not being found.
since glide2 accesses the video card directly, glide2 applications will either need to be run by root or be setuid root.
most windows users were switching to nvidia, and despite the fact that the nvidia drivers were proprietary, even linux users began to jump onto the nvidia bandwagon.
here is how you can get the call stack at barf-time: sometimes distros set up their os so that core files (which are mainly useful to programmers) aren't generated.
voodoo card hardware acceleration only takes place only at 16bpp color and fails silently when starting x in another color depth.
that is, code gets linked into the executable at run time, as opposed to compile time.
trilinear texture filtering trilinear filtering is a high quality bilinear filter which uses the four closest pixels in the second most suitable mip map to produce smoother transitions between mip map levels.
the x86 architecture isn't required, but is recommended since it allows actual x86 binary execution as well as direct dll usage).
it has support from nvidia (nforce2/3 based motherboards come with openal ms windows libraries for the on-board audio), apple has added openal to their audio framework for osx and it can also be found powering the epic games
commercial games will have a printed manual and maybe some readme files on the cd the game came on.
fwiw, i've been able to finish many of the games that are listed as 90% done with no problems.
your sound card is represented by/dev/dsp.
if my sound card is pci, the preferred way of fixing this would be to simply move one of the cards to a different slot and hope the bios sorts things out.
it'll tell you things like screen and window resolution, color depth, window gravity state (which gives a hint to the window manager about where to place new windows), backing store usage and more.
error:can't open data file 'mind.dat'.
you also see an oven, refrigerator and a door leading east.
these days sims and strats are nearly indistinguishable, but a long time ago, sims were real time while strats were turn based.
it exists only to support dri on voodoo iii, iv and v boards under xfree86 4.x.
as a last note, you can't look up information in source code of commercial games from lokisoft or tribsoft.
you get what you pay for with speakers, but don't expect a huge difference.
moreover,vmware has only limited support for directx, and you might not be able to play recent games.
frotz is gpl, runs all versions of z-machine and will compile on most versions of unix.
second, the action takes place in first person.
so it makes some sense to talk about howgcc andld.so go about finding libraries in the first place.
as far as i can see, the developers really do listen to the subscriber polls.
when you compile a program, by default,gcc uses dynamic libraries, but you can makegcc use static libraries instead by using the -static switch.
nvidia uses a convenient combined driver architecture; their driver will support the tnt 2 all the way up to the geforce 5900.
this module (and its device file/dev/3dfx) allows glide2 graphical hardware acceleration for non-root users of non-setuid applications.
just like opengl, mesa makes use of hardware acceleration whenever possible.
most games don't need the low-level interface that xlib provides.
as far as i can see, the developers really do listen to the subscriber polls.
in turn, it motivates me to write more and add to this document.
hardware acceleration works only for the root user 9.2.1.
if you're playing a game under x, don't run a window manager, and certainly don't run a desktop manager like gnome or kde.
this file contains a list of directories that you wantld.so to search for dynamic libraries.
withgcc -print-search-dirs ld.so looks to a binary hash contained in a file named /etc/ld.so.cache for a list of directories that contain available dynamic libraries.
nvidia's party line was they license some of their gl code from another company, and is thus non-releasable.
if you have a pentium4 or an athlonxp, you could compile you own version specifically for your processor.
however, occasionally, they'll have things like code warrior or redhat linux on sale.
when a computer "locks", also called "hung", the keyboard and mouse become completely unresponsive.
if you're looking at a console, the system will print the devices which were remounted.
while linux is known for stability, these things do happen, especiallly for gaming which entails highly synchronized hardware events which occur very fast, even to a computer.
for example, if my problem was that quake iii crashed everytime lucy jumps, i would enter "linux quake3 crash lucy jumps" in the "find messages with all of the words" textbox.
glxinfo gives lots of useful information about opengl like whether direct rendering enabled, the currently installed versions of glx and mesa, vendor/renderer strings, the gl library files being used and more.
it's also much cheaper than vmware.
the engine refers to the actual game itself (doom, quake, heretic2) and plays out the maps and bad guys outlined by the datafile (doom2.wad, pak0.pak, etc).
the voodoo banshee was released in september 1998 as a combined 2d/3d card, like the rush.
for example, if you have a voodoo i, ii or iii card under xfree86 3.x, you'd use mesa+glide2 (written by david bucciarelli) which is the mesa implementation of opengl that uses glide2 as a backend to render for graphical operations.
gamers want high quality sound for our games with the least amount of tinkering.
your one stop shop for buying any commercial linux game (software vendors like tribsoft and loki have online shops at their websites too).
frankly, there's enough games for me, although it would be really nice to have some of the bleeding edge games and classics like half-life and carmageddon.
this means that there are different builds of mesa depending on what kind of video card you have.
this fact alone makes both win4lin and vmware unsuitable for most hardcore gaming purposes.
you'll find this option under "kernel hacking | kernel debugging | magic sysrq key" in whatever kernel config menu you like to use.
however, there may be times when you'll want to play around with mode timings, like for weird hardware or if want to tweak your display.
the information is very detailed, and perhaps overkill for gamers.
next there are the `point and click adventures' which basically have no text interface at all, and often have dynamic graphics, like a cat wandering around the room while you're deciding what to do next.
i hate howto's that include the license; it's a tree killer.
if you're playing an open source game that you compiled, make sure you have the newest version by checking the game's website.
the king of video cards worked with linux developers.
this is important for people who use usb joysticks.
many sci based games (games written in sci0) can be played using freesci, available athttp://freesci.linuxgames.com.
if certain keys on your keyboard don't work, be creative.
3dfx's voodoo iv, its direct competitor, was about a year late which is very bad when you're competing for a bleeding edge market.
however, there may be times when you'll want to play around with mode timings, like for weird hardware or if want to tweak your display.
if you compile your own games, your biggest problem with libraries will either be thatgcc can't find a static library or perhaps the library doesn't exist on your system.
mp entertainment released hopkins fbi, my favorite game ever released for linux.
in addition, the faq keeps a fairly large database of linux games.
agi: adventure gaming interface (sierra) the older sierra dos graphical adventure games used a scripting language named agi (adventure gaming interface).
when playing games from binary, your library woes will be either be thatld.so can't find the library or
accessing the device file.
if there are enough questions (or even protests) i'll add more basic information to this document.
if your game allows for saved games, then sending the author a copy of the saved game is useful because it helps the tech reproduce whatever is going wrong.
the commands deallocvt and openvt will work for most of the other problems you'll have.deallocvt n kills terminal n entirely, so that alt-fn doesn't even work anymore.openvt -c
take the time to read and understand what each field means.
it should contain some.desktop files, each corresponding to an entry you'll see in gdm's session menu, e.ggnome.desktop, enlightenment.destop.
there's another benefit of these scripts: they are easily edited to allow you to provide your own copy of a library.
sarien also has numerous enhancements not found in the original games, like a quake style pull-down console, picture and dictionary viewer, enhanced sound and support for agds, a russian agi clone.
because of this, there are lots of libraries like sdl (section 3.10 ) for 2d graphics, opengl (section 3.3) for 3d graphics and widget sets ( section 3.9) for widgets within windows which hide the details of different aspects of xlib programming.
yet game companies persist using directx and therefore limit their audience to windows users only.
you might also try a virtual machine like win4lin or vmware instead of an emulator.
if this didn't work after a few seconds, you'll definitely want to reboot the system using the following instructions.
directplay directplay gives support for simplified networking for multiplayer gaming.
it'll give you: the hsync/vsync range specified in your xf86config file the 4 horizontal and 4 vertical numbers which defines your videomode (the 1st horizontal/vertical numbers gives the screen resolution).
the version at my personal web site might be broken if i'm working on the howto.
your sound card is represented by/dev/dsp.
their effort is above and beyond the call of duty: frédéric delanoy, moritz muehlenhoff , mike phillips, ioan rogers i would also like to thank the following people for sending in comments and corrections.

the radeon will be slightly stronger on windows.
comment out the lines containing the wm or desktop manager with a pound sign (#) and place your game on a new line with any command line arguments you want to pass.
card reviews claim that it has some serious heat, noise, and dust issues.
for example, if my problem was that quake iii crashed everytime lucy jumps, i would enter "linux quake3 crash lucy jumps" in the "find messages with all of the words" textbox.
for example, you're managing a city and a fire erupts somewhere.
if hardware acceleration is not possible for a specific task, opengl falls back on software rendering.
the first thing you should try is to hit control-alt-backspace which kills x. if you gain control of your system, the kernel wasn't really locked in the first place.
shared interrupt the first thing to do is to figure out if you have an irq conflict.
by the way, loki now has a utility that searches for loki software on your hard drive and automatically updates them.
the developers have no plans on extending exult to interpret the other ultimas since the engines changed so radically between releases.
as a last note, the only systematic linux video card benchmarking effort i'm aware of was done, unfortunately, in march 2001, between a radeon 32 ddr and a geforce 2.
the exult team has also been hard at work creating a map editor, exult studio, and a script compiler that will let users create their own rpg in the ultima style.
in return, as wine maturation improved, the winex developers were going to take the new versions of wine and use them for winex.
hosed consoles sometimes a game will exit abnormally and your console will get `hosed'.
* users procede to step 2), look at the output of x -probeonly.
by receiving feedback on this howto (even if i don't have the time to answer), you make me feel like i'm doing something useful.
some rpg's are quite complicated and great feats of programming.
if the game is not located in your $path, give its full path name.
saved games if your game allows for saved games, then sending the author a copy of the saved game is useful because it helps the tech reproduce whatever is going wrong.
mip mapping reduces memory bandwidth requirements since the images are in hardware, but it also offers better quality in the rendered image.
when a computer locks, it can be a "hard lock", meaning the kernel has completely stopped functioning.
note that if you use a journalling filesystem like ext3, reiserfs or xfs, hitting the power switch isn't all that bad.
it's claimed that these drivers are piss poor; a friend of mine claims his geforce 4400 outperforms his radeon 9700 pro.
emulation and virtual machines linux gets ragged on a lot because we don't have the wealth of games that other platforms have.
even if i don't take your suggestions, your input is graciously received.
now if your goal is to run win95 type os games under linux, win4lin almost seems better than vmware.
even lightweight wms, like twm, rob your cpu of clock cycles (and in twm's case, even full screen games will have a frame around the window).
sarien was written in sdl, so it should run on any platform that can compile sdl programs.
if you want to reboot but the `o' key doesn't work, try using halt.
you won't be disappointed with this service.
alternatively, some isa cards can be set to use a specific irq using jumpers on the card itself.
the ati linux drivers have been plagued by extremely poor performance.
configuration is also a bit funky; this emulator would benefit from an svga or x based configuration tool.
win4lin cannot use an existing windows installation the way wine can.
one of the best diagnostic tools and sources of information about your x system isprobeonly output.

for example, you can type "ps ax", and you're sure to have an `h', `a', `l' and a `t' somewhere on the screen.
xfree86 home page this is the canonical website for people who want to program games under linux.
in the example above, we can see that nwmain wants libmss.so.6, and the linker cannot find it.
the output of x goes to stderr, so we have to redirect stderr with "2>" to a file named x.out.
if this is the case, as root, look at the group owner of the sound card usingls -l /dev/dsp; it'll probably be audio.
as you play, the character becomes more powerful and the game adjusts itself accordingly, so instead of fighting orcs, at high levels you start fighting black dragons.
it's actually a meta-library, meaning that not only is it a graphics library which hides the details of xlib programming, it provides an easy interface for sound, music and event handling.
unlike xlib (section 3.8), sdl is very suited for game programming.
you can read it for yourself at http://www.linuxhardware.org/features/01/03/19/0357219.shtml, but conclusion is that the geforce 2 firmly and soundly trounced the radeon 32 ddr.
but 3dfx reigned supreme, and nobody could touch them.
wabi is fast and does a good job for what it does, although i've heard it said that wabi for solaris is more stable than linux.
this howto is mainly of interest to musicians who want professional or semi professional sound cards for the recording and making of music on a computer.
my web browser of choice, opera (available athttp://www.opera.com) allows you to use the right mouse button to select a portion of text and left click the selection to translate it into another language.
for gaming you might want to look at winex (section 10.5.3).
it's used for a number of purposes, like making adjacent textures blend smoothly and making textures viewed from an angle (think of looking at a billboard from an extreme angle) look realistic.
the t&l is the process of translating all the 3d world information (position, distance, and light sources) into the 2d image that is actually displayed on screen.
if hardware acceleration is working, the fps for glxgears should be nearly independent of window size.
wabi doesn't work under 32bpp or 24bpp color.
strace is a very powerful utility.
very quickly, a core file (aka core dump) is a file that holds the "state" of the program at the moment it crashes.
although arcade games had their heydey in the 80's, they are nonetheless very popular.
on the other hand, a musician would have a very different concept of what "best sound card" would mean.
you won't be disappointed with this service.
the developers have no plans on extending exult to interpret the other ultimas since the engines changed so radically between releases.
you also see an oven, refrigerator and a door leading east.
sometimes, certain keys of the keyboard won't respond.
you won't normally see an fsck for the partitions that use the journalling filesystem.
non-subscribers can browse the forums, but only subscribers can post (and therefore, ask for support).
it's not an understatement to say that xlib is long winded, arcane and complicated.

in the oven you see a brown paper bag.
texture filtering texture filtering is the fundamental feature required to present sweet 3d graphics.
your normally nice black screen could look like a quasi-graphics screen.
presumably, ati doesn't want to release drivers to keep their trade secrets, well, a secret.
texture filtering is the fundamental feature required to present sweet 3d graphics.
xdpyinfo gives cool stuff, like x version and loaded extensions (invaluable when trying to see what's missing, like glx, dri, xfree86-vidmode, etc.).
it shines when viewing alphanumeric characters at an angle.
arcade style although arcade games had their heydey in the 80's, they are nonetheless very popular.
there are some real classics that were written for dos like carmageddon, redneck rampage and tomb raider.
the developers are clearly out of their minds (in a good way!).
but the radeon's drivers were open source, so many linux users stuck by them.
the `manual' can take on a few forms.
this could be something real like a fighter jet or something imaginary like a mechanized warrior combat unit.
that is, it'll run windows 16-bit applications from a windows 3.1, windows 3.11 or windows for workgroups 3.11 environment.
as far linux users are concerned, all three cards are completely identical (although the awe 64 gold has gold plated connectors, which are better for sound quality than the more common steel connectors).
lucasarts wrote an engine for point and click adventures named scumm (script creation utility for maniac mansion).

jzip is another very popular z-machine interpreter that will run v1-v5 and v8 z-machine data files.
a "real computer" provides an operating system many things, including a cpu, i/o channels, memory, a bios to provide low level access to motherboard
if your goal is to run win95/98/me applications on linux, without usb and on the x86 architecture, win4lin's cost and focus on win95 type os's make it a better choice than vmware.
you can play adventure yourself (actually, a descendent); it comes with “bsd games” on most linux distros.
for complicated textures this is a huge savings in processor work.
actually, i cooked this example up because i wanted to show you what an irq conflict looks like.
wabi is fast and does a good job for what it does, although i've heard it
the program can simulate your opponent(s).
judging from their screenshots, this is quite a powerful library.
if you're looking at a console, the system should print the devices which were flushed.
the show-stopper is the fact that vmware has limited directx support while win4lin has none.
the second column is there because i have 2 cpu's in this machine; if you have one cpu (called up, or uniprocessor), you'll have only 1 cpu column.
suppose the library libmp3.so.2 is in /usr/local/include but your new game "kill-metallica" can't find it.
but life was still good for linux.
exult is written in c++ using sdl, so it will compile on any platform that can compile sdl programs.
in addition, an addon disk was released to both part i (the forge of virtue) and part ii (the silver seed).
another nice little trick is for games that use openal for their sound output (e.g. unreal based games: ut, postal, rune, etc.).
naturally you can add a .desktop file for each game you have installed 5.
id software's open sourced the doom codebase and ported quake i to linux (december 1996).
this is awkward for modern day use, since a game like warcraft which everyone knows as a strat, would be a sim by definition.
if your game came from a distro make sure there's not an update rpm/deb for the game.
you can get mesademos with debian ( apt-get install mesademos) or you can hunt for the rpm on http://www.rpmfind.net.
there's a good framebuffer howto available from ldp.
on one hand, they use the most godawful, horrible, confusing, wasteful, moronic format i've ever seen and i hope to god i never see a forum with a format as bad as transgaming's.
sarien also has numerous enhancements not found in the original games, like a quake style pull-down console, picture and dictionary viewer, enhanced sound and support for agds, a russian agi clone.
note that if you pass this test, your system is capable of direct rendering.
with these types of cards, you need to pass the correct irq and memory access, "i/o port", to the driver.
i've had expensive altec lansing speakers perform only slightly better than el-cheapo speakers.
when the texture is near, a bigger one is used.
in these games, you point at an object (say, a book) and can choose from a pull-down list of functions.
you'll want to get something with a separate sub-woofer; this does make a difference at a cost of extra power and connector wires.
if you want a general source of information on game specific questions, the faq is a fantastic place to start with.
however, if you have a creative soundblaster or audigy sound card (with an emu10x chip), and you use alsa sound drivers, you can get openal libraries fromhttp://www.lost.org.uk that provide hardware acceleration and decent surround support.
if you're looking at a console, the system should print the devices which were flushed.
this shouldn't be a surprise since glide2 and glide3 support different video cards and different versions of xfree86.
have everything under the sun compiled as a module and try to load them all.
on uni-processor machines the cpu doesn't have to change context between xfree86 and its client to render the graphics.
however, if you have a creative soundblaster or audigy sound card (with an emu10x chip), and you use alsa sound drivers, you can get openal libraries fromhttp://www.lost.org.uk that provide hardware acceleration and decent surround support.
this file contains a list of directories that you wantld.so to search for dynamic libraries.
aa can be done either by the application itself (as with the gimp or the xfree86 font system) or by hardware, if your video card supports it.
very useful when a google group search yields a page in german which looks useful and my wife (who reads german well) isn't around.
also, i'm not aware of any card that uses anisotropic texture filtering.
at the gdm login screen, you should now see "doom iii" as an option in "sessions".
since it contains binary data, you cannot modify this file directly.
it was another success, but 3dfx began to lose ground to nvidia, which released their tnt 2.
when i talk about 'performance hits', keep in mind that the performance hit depends on what resolution you're running at.
for the paranoid, it's possible to restrict dri to only a few non-root users.
you can still purchase or download a demo of hopkins fbi from their website.
sam had an ulterior motive for writing such a cool library.
even though it was written to share the card between applications, i've found that esd (the enlightenment sound daemon) sometimes doesn't work correctly.
nothing will ever replace walking into a dark, crowded and noisy arcade gallery, popping a quarter into your favorite machine and playing an old fashioned game of space invaders.
on ms windows, when the geforce beat out its main competing radeon, the review claimed that the radeon generally had better visuals.
frankly, there's enough games for me, although it would be really nice to have some of the bleeding edge games and classics like half-life and carmageddon.
there is a program called glxgears which comes with the "mesademos" package.
for example, you're managing a city and a fire erupts somewhere.
note if your keyboard doesn't have asysrq key, use the printscreen key: hit alt-sysrq-s. this will attempt to sync your mounted filesystems so that changes to files get flushed to disk.
1108 p 6w chr 14,3 662302 /dev/dsp fuser is similar; but it lets you send a signal to any process accessing the device file.
you're still supposed to shutdown in an orderly manner, but the filesystem integrity will be maintained.
the number of sampled pixels and which sampled pixels it uses depends on the viewing angle of the surface relative to your screen.
direct3d (d3d) direct3d, like opengl, provides a 3d graphics api.
getting information about your 3d system glxinfo gives lots of useful information about opengl like whether direct rendering enabled, the currently installed versions of glx and mesa, vendor/renderer strings, the gl library files being used and more.
at the *very* least, the author will be interested in the call stack when the game crashed.
although their drivers are closed source, as a company, nvidia has been supportive and good to linux users.
side scrollers are similar to fps but you view your character as a 2d figure who runs around various screens shooting at things or performing tasks.
arcade style games attempt to simulate the arcade games themselves.
basically, it turns many smaller separate writes to the video card into a single write (a burst).
whereas opengl is open source, lower level and compiles under a multitude of operating systems, d3d is proprietary, higher level and only compiles on windows.
for linux, the newest voodoo's could only accelerate at 16 and 24 bit color.
oh, you'll want to run them as root since you'll be asking for information from processes that may be owned by root.
you can read it for yourself at http://www.linuxhardware.org/features/01/03/19/0357219.shtml, but conclusion is that the geforce 2 firmly and soundly trounced the radeon 32 ddr.
finding out what libraries a game depends on most commercial linux games will be dynamically linked against various lgpl libraries, such as openal or sdl.
you can also specify which news server to use using the $nntp environment variable or with the file /etc/nntpserver.
they worked with linux developers, open sourced all their drivers and were hailed as the great hope for linux gaming.
if you do this correctly, then in principle, there's no way for the poor application to know whether it's really accessing hardware or tricked by being given resources which simulate hardware.
the output of x goes to stderr, so we have to redirect stderr with "2>" to a file named x.out.
if you can ssh in, reboot or halt the system.
if you want to learn more about core files, i have a great gdb tutorial athttp://www.dirac.org/linux.
if you want to do things like convert a record lp to digital format, then your choice of a soundcard with a professional grade a/d converter is absolutely crucial.
dri allows x clients to write 3d rendering information directly to the video card in a safe and cooperative manner.
in mid 2002, parts of wine were re-licensed under the lgpl so that it could only be used for non-commercial puposes.
fortunately, we have more emulators than you can shake a stick at.
as root, change to the "/usr/share/xsessions" directory and take a look at its contents.
game reviewers agree that this game has the features of quake with a story-line more compelling than half-life.
while linux is known for stability, these things do happen, especiallly for gaming which entails highly synchronized hardware events which occur very fast, even to a computer.
it provides all the services that a real computer would provide.
this excellently done page has many nice links for interactive fiction fans.
in contrast to dynamic libraries which provide code while the application runs, static libraries contain code which gets linked (inserted) into the program while it's being compiled.
even if i don't take your suggestions, your input is graciously received.
for open source games there's the readme files that come with the game.
most applications that use svgalib can be run on x or any other libggi backend by using a wrapper library which re-implements svgalib (section 3.12) using libggi.
despite the astounding fact that the linux gamers' faq doesn't mention the linux gamers' howto as a resource anywhere in their text, i regard the faq as a good companion to this howto.
the people atwinehq are writing their own set of libraries called libwine which implements the win32 api with no microsoft code at all.
use it, and you'll be a much happier person.
they have also more functionality than the publicly available tarball: the latter is an older version which lacks some of the newest features, like support for copy protected programs.
nothing will ever replace walking into a dark, crowded and noisy arcade gallery, popping a quarter into your favorite machine and playing an old fashioned game of space invaders.
in this sense, wine is a windows-to-linux porting utility.
thanks goes out to these people for extensive comments, corrections, and diffs.
you won't normally see an fsck for the partitions that use the journalling filesystem.
text adventure (aka interactive fiction) once upon a time, when apple ][, commodore, and atari ruled the world, text adventures were the game of choice of `intelligent folk'.
they can be set in fantasy (hexen), science fiction (quake ii), present day `real world' (soldier of fortune) and many other settings.
when you pressenter, a newline doesn't get echo'ed to the screen.
sometimes you'll see error messages that indicate a file wasn't found.
copy any of the desktop files to " doom3.desktop" and open the new file in your favourite text editor.
even when ati open sourced its video card driver, they played the "we'll make linux developers write our drivers for us" game.
i don't think this application has a homepage.
the more time it takes for you mobilize the fire fighters, the more damage the fire does.
they include things like text entry boxes, pulldown menus, slider bars, radio buttons and much more.
until this point, ati had always been an innovative (they developed their own 3d acceleration chips in 1996, about the same time as 3dfx), but sleepy graphics chipset manufacturer.
dri gets the x server out of the way so the 3d driver (mesa or opengl) can talk directly to the hardware.
it's not an understatement to say that xlib is long winded, arcane and complicated.
multimedia api's are more centralized on windows than they are on linux.
for the paranoid, it's possible to restrict dri to only a few non-root users.
graphics data isn't sent over a socket to the x server.
you should definitely ask before sending a save game file because they tend to be long, but gaming companies usually have lots of bandwidth.
hardware acceleration problems xfree86 4.x provides a more centralized and self-contained approach to video.
getting info about your setup: xwininfo xwininfo tells you all sorts of information about x windows.
withgcc -print-search-dirs ld.so looks to a binary hash contained in a file named /etc/ld.so.cache for a list of directories that contain available dynamic libraries.
vmware is considerably more expensive.
in mid 2002, parts of wine were re-licensed under the lgpl so that it could only be used for non-commercial puposes.
that is, code gets linked into the executable at run time, as opposed to compile time.
however, for 5 us dollars per month, you can become a subscriber of transgaming.
this is a way of adding to the linkers search path.
if you're in the market to buy a sound card, get something that will take you a second to configure.
while the insanely popular ultima series, written by richard garriot (aka lord british) for origin, was not the first rpg, it popularized and propelled the rpg genre into mainstream.
if you can't, ssh in from a another machine.
secondly, svgalib is video card dependent–if your video card isn't supported by svgalib, you're out of luck.
gamers want high quality sound for our games with the least amount of tinkering.
if you already have a card and it works well, that's good enough.
since glide2 accesses the video card directly, glide2 applications will either need to be run by root or be setuid root.
system shock is a classic first person shooter/adventure from 1994, which puts it as a contemporary of doom.
because of the nature of the vm, the foreign os can't tell the difference between operating in a vm or in a "real" machine.
this is why a game can easily take out a windows system but should not take down a linux system.
not all linux distributions are supported: newest redhat's, mandrake's and suse's are, but you're out of luck if you have an other version and/or distribution (like debian).
running a game without a wm or de depends on how you access x. if you usually log in to a virtual console and start x with "startx" try the following: modify ~/.xinitrc, which tells x what to run upon starting.
if you're looking at a console, the system will print the devices which were remounted.
however, with bigger and better games on the horizon, it was only a matter of time before the voodoos would no longer be a viable graphics card for modern gaming.
the rewards increase correspondingly.
the file will be full of alternative languages, so cut out everything you don't want and make the file look like this: [desktop entry] encoding=utf-8 name=doom iii comment=id's doom iii #if game is not in path, remember to put the full path here exec=/usr/games/doom3/doom3 # no icon yet, only the top three are currently used icon= type=application save the file and log out of your window manager.
pixels are rectangular objects, so drawing an angled line or curve with them results in a 'stair step' effect, also called the 'jaggies'.
despite the faster 100mhz core, the banshee was outperformed by the voodoo ii because its multi-texturing unit was removed, like with the rush.
also, i'm not aware of any card that uses anisotropic texture filtering.
when the texture is far away a smaller version of the texture (mip map) is used.
simulation (aka sims) simulations strive to immerse the player behind the controls of something they normally wouldn't have access to.
mp3blaster after issuing this command, mp3blaster was killed with sigkill.
of course we can't cover every bad thing that happens, but i'll outline some items of common sense.
games written in svgalib will only work on linux.
he was the lead programmer for loki software (he now codes for blizzard software), which used sdl in all of its games except for quake3.
real time strats are based on the concept of you-snooze-you-lose.
the reason why it's not an emulator is subtle and not of much interest to most non computer scientists, so we'll call it an emulator here (it really does run-time translation of calls to the win32 api to posix/x11 calls).
the x86 architecture isn't required, but is recommended since it allows actual x86 binary execution as well as direct dll usage).
openal aims to be for sound what opengl is for graphics.
between losing the benchmark wars to the geforce and radeon, their lateness with new cards and high prices, 3dfx lost its market share and didn't have the funds to stay into business.
any graphics programming in x ultimately makes use of the xlib library.
linux gamers would either keep their open source voodoos, get an open source radeon or a closed source geforce.
a team of people developed exult  which is an open source interpreter that will run both parts of ultima 7 and their addon disks.
if the magic sysrq key sequence doesn't shut your system down gracefully, your kernel has crashed hard and you'll need to use the reset or power button to recover.
in return, as wine maturation improved, the winex developers were going to take the new versions of wine and use them for winex.
if for some reason you're using x 3.3, follow the instructions given by mtrr.txt (see section 5.1) to set up your mtrrs.
note that vmware supports up to 2 usb devices.
the canonical example would be the so-called `hi-res adventures' like the wizard and the princess.
while nvidia was putting real r&d into their cards, 3dfx was simply adding more and faster ram.
while the insanely popular ultima series, written by richard garriot (aka lord british) for origin, was not the first rpg, it popularized and propelled the rpg genre into mainstream.
these cards are extremely cheap and trivial to get working under linux.
for dynamic situations, like games, doing aa in hardware can be crucial.
it's claimed that these drivers are piss poor; a friend of mine claims his geforce 4400 outperforms his radeon 9700 pro.
starting with pentium class processors and including athlon, k6-2 and other cpus, there are memory type range registers (mtrr) which control how the processor accesses ranges of memory locations.
if you have your heart set to buy the best card for linux, you'll want to go with the geforce 5900.
you can read the osl at http://opensource.org/licenses/osl-1.1.txt.
more important than fps is having a constant fps for small and large windows.
i used to be a fan of the creative soundblaster awe 32, awe 64 and awe 64 gold soundcards.
it uses the virtual machine approach to running windows applications, so you'll get a big window from which you can boot windows and run all kinds of windows applications.
needless to say, this only applies if your game crashes reproducably at a certain point.
these isa pnp cards are well supported by both oss and alsa.
more nudity than hustler.
third, svgalib is linux only.
if the page is not in a language you can understand, there are many translation sites which will convert the text into whatever language you like, including http://www.freetranslation.com and http://translation.lycos.com.
if you can, an orderly shutdown is preferable; use "halt" or "shutdown".
for open source games, you can help the author by giving a corefile or stack trace.
suppose the library libmp3.so.2 is in /usr/local/include but your new game "kill-metallica" can't find it.
personally, i prefer the free oss drivers, but many people swear by alsa.
in addition, by using the higher level libraries, a game writer can develop his game on multiple platforms, even ones that don't use xfree86.
also, voodoo cards need the 3dfx.o kernel module and a /dev/3dfx device file (major 107, minor 0) for non-root hardware acceleration.
the first step is to make your system allow unlimited coresizes: ulimit -c unlimited you will now have to recompile the program and pass the -g option to gcc (explaining this is beyond the scope of this document).
gcc looks for libraries in the ``standard system directories'' plus any directories you specify with the-l option.
similar to fps, but you view your character in third person and in 3d. on modern third person shooters you can usually do some really kick-butt maneuvers like jackie chan style back flips and side rolls.
the first thing you should try is to hit control-alt-backspace which kills x. if you gain control of your system, the kernel wasn't really locked in the first place.
developers have reported that svgalib works on the radeon 7500, radeon qd (64mb ddr model) but has problems on the radeon ve.
use control-alt-delete to reboot the system.
any game-supplied copy of a library such as openal or sdl is likely to be compiled for the lowest common denominator, probably i486 or i686.
it's not very cheap (about 300$ for the workstation version), but you can get a 30 day evaluation copy.
moreover,vmware has only limited support for directx, and you might not be able to play recent games.
card, logic and board games computer based card games simulate a card game like poker or solitaire.
the "x window user howto", and especially "man xf86config" arerequired reading.
however, all ati cards beyond the radeon 9200 also require a proprietary driver that will "taint" your kernel as well.
running quake iii and quitting normally fixed the problem.
these cards are extremely cheap and trivial to get working under linux.
trilinear filtering is capable of producing fine visuals, but it only samples from a square area which in some cases is not the ideal method.
there aren't many graphical adventures written natively for linux.
tnt drivers claim they do, but i've read that these drivers still use trilinear filtering when actually rendering an image to the screen.
being a subscriber of transgaming gives three major benefits: subscribers can download convenient packaged versions of winex in deb, rpm or tar.gz format whenever they want, including updates.
on uni-processor machines the cpu doesn't have to change context between xfree86 and its client to render the graphics.
in addition, there isn't an evaluation copy available, although you get a 30 day money back guarantee.
dosemu can run these.
in addition, an addon disk was released to both part i (the forge of virtue) and part ii (the silver seed).
the tnt/tnt2 driver is based on reverse-engineering of the obfuscated source code release of the x 3.3 drivers by nvidia.
however, its engine is much more feature rich than the original doom: for example, system shock had 3d sprites, free look and a facility to have objects on top of each other, giving the illusion of a full 3d map, like quake.
commercial game companies like loki release patches for their games.
however, since it's commercial you do get tech support.
to use the magic sysrq key, your kernel needs to have been compiled with magic sysrq support.
if you're a game writer, please consider using cross platform libraries and stay away from directx. a company named realtechvr started an open source project, directx port, which, like wine, provides a direct3d emulation layer that implements direct3d calls.
a few notes: first, the soundblaster awe howto is very out of date.
logging out and back in don't always work, but there are a few things that might: if you don't see any character on the screen as you type in, your terminal settings may be wrong.
because of this, there are lots of libraries like sdl (section 3.10 ) for 2d graphics, opengl (section 3.3) for 3d graphics and widget sets ( section 3.9) for widgets within windows which hide the details of different aspects of xlib programming.
it exists only to support dri on voodoo iii, iv and v boards under xfree86 4.x.
the file will be full of alternative languages, so cut out everything you don't want and make the file look like this: [desktop entry] encoding=utf-8 name=doom iii comment=id's doom iii #if game is not in path, remember to put the full path here exec=/usr/games/doom3/doom3 # no icon yet, only the top three are currently used icon= type=application save the file and log out of your window manager.
nvidia has proven that they care enough about linux to write and maintain current and very high quality drivers for linux.
3dfx's voodoo iv, its direct competitor, was about a year late which is very bad when you're competing for a bleeding edge market.
mip mapping reduces memory bandwidth requirements since the images are in hardware, but it also offers better quality in the rendered image.
side scrollers side scrollers are similar to fps but you view your character as a 2d figure who runs around various screens shooting at things or performing tasks.
jzip is another very popular z-machine interpreter that will run v1-v5 and v8 z-machine data files.
a team of people developed exult which is an open source interpreter that will run both parts of ultima 7 and their addon disks.
if something is already accessing your card, other applications won't be able to.
the program can simulate your opponent(s).
it should contain some.desktop files, each corresponding to an entry you'll see in gdm's session menu, e.ggnome.desktop, enlightenment.destop.
if direct rendering is disabled, then your x configuration is definitely faulty.
many sci based games (games written in sci0) can be played using freesci, available athttp://freesci.linuxgames.com.
when a particular graphics task isn't able to be hardware accelerated by the video card, it's software rendered; the task is done by your computer's cpu instead.
linux publishing doesn't sell directly to the public, but provides professional game publishing to authors of publishing.
each interpreter has its own set of strengths, and you can find links to them on the home pages for frotz and jzip.
the tnt 2 outperformed the voodoo ii, and accelerated 3d graphics at full 32 bit color, while the voodoo's were stuck at 16 bit color.
you get what you pay for with speakers, but don't expect a huge difference.
although playing an emulated game is sometimes not quite as fun as playing it on the native machine, and getting some of the emulators to work well can be a difficult task, they're here, and there's alot of them!
the xterm from which you run glxgears will display "x frames in y seconds =
my personal recommendation is any card which has the es1370 or es1371 chip, which uses the es1370 and es1371 sound drivers on linux.
i've never owned one, so i cannot comment here.
when diagnosing why things aren't being found, it's your best ally, and is even faster than looking at source code.
you'll find this option under "kernel hacking | kernel debugging | magic sysrq key" in whatever kernel config menu you like to use.
at some point, your character becomes powerful enough that you can `go for it' and try to complete the quest.
you can get the latest cvs from their sourceforge page at .
note that since this file was written, xfree86 has been patched to automatically detect your video ram base address and size and set up the mtrrs.
making nwn use your system copy is easy.
you can play ultima vii under linux with exult (section 11.7).
if you have a pentium4 or an athlonxp, you could compile you own version specifically for your processor.
first, you pretty much blow up everything you see.
this increases efficiency in writing to the video card and can speed up your graphics by 250% or more.
because of the ati linux driver woes, linux users cannot use ms windows based benchmarks or card stats.
if you have success using dosemu, i would like to hear from you.
unless you plan on compiling your games from source code, you'll mainly be interested in dynamic libraries.
you can use wine `with windows', which means that wine uses libraries that actually come with microsoft windows itself.
i don't think this application has a homepage.
like vmware, you're required to have a licensed copy of win95 or win98.
at high levels, you might get a magic sword or a kick-butt assault rifle.
note that if you pass this test, your system is capable of direct rendering.
they can be set in fantasy (hexen), science fiction (quake ii), present day `real world' (soldier of fortune) and many other settings.
the copies ofopenal.so distributed with games often do not support alsa, so making the game use a copy compiled yourself will allow you to use alsa natively.
if you want to learn more about core files, i have a great gdb tutorial athttp://www.dirac.org/linux.
directshow directshow provides support for movie files like avi and mpg.
even when an ati offering is better than the current geforce offering for windows, the card is always trounced by geforce on linux.
most windows users were switching to nvidia, and despite the fact that the nvidia drivers were proprietary, even linux users began to jump onto the nvidia bandwagon.
(object) files archived together, similar to a tar file.
isa cards can't share interrupts.
va linux, the largest linux server vendor, put nvidia into their machines.
heavyweight wms, like enlightenment, or full-blown desktop environments like gnome or kde, may produce a noticeable slow down.
email the author and tell him: the game's name any error message that appears on the screen when the game crashes.
note if your keyboard doesn't have asysrq key, use the printscreen key: hit alt-sysrq-s. this will attempt to sync your mounted filesystems so that changes to files get flushed to disk.
for commercial games, this option is more fruitful than sending a core file or call stack since commercial games can't be recompiled to include debugging information.
the most striking part of sdl is that it's a cross platform library.
if you already have a card and it works well, that's good enough.
memory type range registers starting with pentium class processors and including athlon, k6-2 and other cpus, there are memory type range registers (mtrr) which control how the processor accesses ranges of memory locations.
but 3d information (see glide2,section 3.1) would be passed to the voodoo i and rendered, using the voodoo's fast hardware to perform the necessary graphics calculations.
it shines when viewing alphanumeric characters at an angle.
on one hand, they use the most godawful, horrible, confusing, wasteful, moronic format i've ever seen and i hope to god i never see a forum with a format as bad as transgaming's.
as you play, the character becomes more powerful and the game adjusts itself accordingly, so instead of fighting orcs, at high levels you start fighting black dragons.
that is, through the eyes of the character who's doing all the shooting.
we had a card that was almost neck-to-neck with nvidia, our drivers were open source, and in december 1999, id software gave us a huge gift: they open sourced the quake i codebase.
turn based strats are more like chess---the computer takes a turn and then the player takes a turn.
your normally nice black screen could look like a quasi-graphics screen.
it's very complete and is one of my favorite sites.
don't discount them; they're very cheap (like 10 or 20 bucks), support bleeding edge sound cards and take a lot of guesswork out of the configuring process.
i'd also appreciate either a copy of whatever it is you're doing or a spinach, garlic, mushroom, feta cheese and artichoke heart pizza.
a google search should turn up alot of information on this problem.
however, if the problem is repeatable "it happens when i press the left arrow key twice", then you're in business.
i happen to be a fan of this library and of graphical console games in general; they are extremely fast, fullscreen and compelling.
a program can only use the special hardware accelerated features of these cards by using the glide2 library in one of two ways: directly written using glide2 (myth ii, descent iii) indirectly using mesa built with a glide2 backend to simulate opengl (rune, unreal tournament) 3dfx opened up the specifications and source code to the open source
a common problem you'll see in gaming is a library file not being found.
if you're a musician, you might want to check out the linux audio quality howto.
since aa is cpu intensive, it's more desirable to perform it in hardware, but if we're talking about semi-static applications, like the gimp, this really isn't an issue.
on the other hand, a musician would have a very different concept of what "best sound card" would mean.
it'll give you: the hsync/vsync range specified in your xf86config file the 4 horizontal and 4 vertical numbers which defines your videomode (the 1st horizontal/vertical numbers gives the screen resolution).
the aim is to keep rewind mit/x11 based so that companies like transgaming can offer wine based products.
/usr/lib/./libasound.so.2 (0x40b90000) ldd shows all the libraries a dynamic executable relies on, and shows you where they are.
gcc will then `place a memo inside the executable' that says to look at the files /usr/lib/libsdl.so and /lib/libm.so.3 whenever an sdl or math function is used.
it is an excellently written document that gives you step by step information on how to get dri set up correctly on your machine.
you can also download and compile the source yourself from the mesa homepage.
however, if the problem is repeatable "it happens when i press the left arrow key twice", then you're in business.
none of the games which use glide2 will work with glide3.
this shouldn't be a surprise since glide2 and glide3 support different video cards and different versions of xfree86.
the tnt 2 outperformed the voodoo ii, and accelerated 3d graphics at full 32 bit color, while the voodoo's were stuck at 16 bit color.
if you can't ssh into the system, you'll need to use the "magic sysrq key" which is documented in/usr/src/linux/documentation/sysrq.txt.
a permissions problem the first thing to do is to figure out if you have an irq conflict.
i think this means disk copying, packaging and selling to retailers.
however, they're really incomplete, and effectively, unusable.
not a big deal when you're trying to run wordperfect or an old database application.
but your process table will be a ghost town, and all that extra cpu will go straight to your game.
in nethack you need to retrieve the amulet of yendor for your god.
isa cards can't share interrupts.
naturally you can add a .desktop file for each game you have installed
so to use these two libraries, you would passgcc the -lsdl -lm options.
when diagnosing why things aren't being found, it's your best ally, and is even faster than looking at source code.
this improves a game's visuals, but can also dramatically degrade performance.
rather than trusting programmers to write totally bug free, cooperative programs that access hardware, linux simply disallowed it.
opengl provides a powerful, complete and generic feature set for 2d and 3d graphics operations.
so many linux users stuck by them.
if you haven't compiled the kernel yourself, there is an overwhelmingly good chance that your system is set up to load sound drivers as modules.
although their drivers are closed source, as a company, nvidia has been supportive and good to linux users.
there is a program called glxgears which comes with the "mesademos" package.
it was the 2nd worst day for linux gaming (the 1st being the demise of loki).
the commands deallocvt and openvt will work for most of the other problems you'll have.deallocvt n kills terminal n entirely, so that alt-fn doesn't even work anymore.openvt -c
as of june 2002, svgalib support radeon cards is shaky.
as far linux users are concerned, all three cards are completely identical (although the awe 64 gold has gold plated connectors, which are better for sound quality than the more common steel connectors).
i'm not entirely sure of the quality of these open source drivers, however, soldier of fortune i and heavy metal still have opaque texture problems under first generation radeons.
like the voodoo i, the voodoo ii was a 3d only card, and piggy backed with a 2d video card.
dynamic libraries dynamic libraries, also called a “shared library”, provide object code for an application while it's running.
the people atwinehq are writing their own set of libraries called libwine which implements the win32 api with no microsoft code at all.
and again like the rush, it wasn't popular.
this is important for people who use usb joysticks.
your change doesn't actually make it into/etc/ld.so.cache until you run ldconfig ; once it's run, ld.so will begin to look for libraries in your private directory.
these cards include the older ensoniq es1370 and newer creative pci-128.
some examples of games written in agi would be leisure suit larry i (ega), space quest i and ii, king's quest ii, mixed-up mother goose and others.
at some point, your character becomes powerful enough that you can `go for it' and try to complete the quest.
so when xwininfo asks you to click on the window you want the information on, click on your background.
the interface is a bit funky, but usable.
except for a few details, a program written in sdl will compile under linux, ms windows, beos, macos, macos x, solaris, irix, freebsd, qnx and osf.
they don't necessarily have to be violent, likexscavenger, a clone of the old 8-bit game lode runner.
it's painful the first time you do it, but once you do it correctly, it becomes very easy down the right, especially if you keep all your old .config files and make use of things like "make oldconfig".
+set r_gldriver libgr.so.1 #exec ut #lsdldoom -server 2 #exec tribes2 exec /usr/bin/enlightenment you'll usually see a window or desktop manager being executed from this file (gnome or kde).
netscape has a nice graphical "point and click" newsreader too.
if this is the case, as root, look at the group owner of the sound card usingls -l /dev/dsp; it'll probably be audio.
libggi applications run on svgalib, fb, and x servers among others.
accelerated functions on 3dfx's voodoo i, ii and iii cards, under xfree86 3.x.
you can among others use it to run a ms windows os and launch your favourite game there.
it's said that wine has the best success when run with windows.
pci cards are much easier to deal with than isa since you don't need to tell their drivers about which system resources (irq, dma, i/o addresses) to use.
wabi does not do dos itself, but it looks like it can use a dos emulator as a backend for running dos programs.
also, even if you just add extra libraries to your system, you must update ld.so.cache to reflect the presence of the new libraries.
you can get the latest cvs from their sourceforge page at .
it holds valuable clues for the programmer to the nature of the crash -- what caused it and what the program was doing when it happened.
at its lowest level, it provides a platform independent (as much as that is possible in c++) way of dealing with display, sound, input, networking, files, threading and such.
you should definitely have a good configuration in order to run it; they claim the minimum is a 500mhz x86 cpu with 128mb ram, but a faster processor and at least 256mb ram seem to be the bare minimum if you want reasonable performance.
this fact alone makes both win4lin and vmware unsuitable for most hardcore gaming purposes.
direct3d, like opengl, provides a 3d graphics api.
note that if you use a journalling filesystem like ext3, reiserfs or xfs, hitting the power switch isn't all that bad.
the implementation tries to use hardware acceleration for various graphics operations whenever available, which depends on what videocard you have in you computer.
once upon a time, when apple ][, commodore, and atari ruled the world, text adventures were the game of choice of `intelligent folk'.
because of the ati linux driver woes, linux users cannot use ms windows based benchmarks or card stats.
that's the way distros do things.
lucasarts wrote an engine for point and click adventures named scumm (script creation utility for maniac mansion).
this allows us to run graphical things in console, like allowing us to choose any font we want the console to display (which is normally set by bios).
to use the magic sysrq key, your kernel needs to have been compiled with magic sysrq support.
you are given a scenario and can interact with the world you're placed in: you are in a room.
font rendering is another big application for aa.
it should've been a more powerful card, with a 50mhz gpu and 8mb of ram.
however, that changed under x 4.x with dri (direct rendering infrastructure .
it provides support for a few cards which are not well supported by dri like the ati rage pro family, s3 virge (although anyone using this for gaming is, well, nuts), and an open source tnt/tnt2 driver (which is very incomplete).
if you haven't compiled the kernel yourself, there is an overwhelmingly good chance that your system is set up to load sound drivers as modules.
a more advanced way of fixing this would be to go into bios and assign irq's to specific slots.
you'll have something like 10 processes running.
the program responsible for linking code “on the fly” is called/etc/ld.so, and the dynamic libraries themselves usually end with.so with a version number, like: /usr/lib/libsdl.so /lib/libm.so.3 when using gcc, you refer to these libraries by shaving off the stringslib, .so and all version numbers.
underworld adventures also provides a bunch of tools for you to display the level maps, tools for examining uw1 conversation scripts and more.
in other words, your graphics card isn't 3d accelerating graphics.
for linux, the newest voodoo's could only accelerate at 16 and 24 bit color.
even better, it was their first combined 2d/3d card, meaning that it freed up a valuable pci slot (most pc's only had a couple of pci slots back then) but the rush wasn't as popular.
your change doesn't actually make it into/etc/ld.so.cache until you run ldconfig ; once it's run, ld.so will begin to look for libraries in your private directory.
the canonical example would be the so-called `hi-res adventures' like the wizard and the princess.
xwininfo tells you all sorts of information about x windows.
however, for 5 us dollars per month, you can become a subscriber of transgaming.
they offer reel deal slots, which is very nicely done!
it was the 2nd worst day for linux gaming (the 1st being the demise of loki).
tnt drivers claim they do, but i've read that these drivers still use trilinear filtering when actually rendering an image to the screen.
it was another success, but 3dfx began to lose ground to nvidia, which released their tnt 2.
in the worst case scenario, hit the reset or power switch.
you'll need to purchase a copy of ultima 7 to play.
see the man pages for lsof and fuser; they're very useful.
you can use the mouse to cut and paste the word "halt".
however, its engine is much more feature rich than the original doom: for example, system shock had 3d sprites, free look and a facility to have objects on top of each other, giving the illusion of a full 3d map, like quake.
directinput directinput gives support for gaming input devices such as joysticks.
the more time it takes for you mobilize the fire fighters, the more damage the fire does.
the game's author has probably seen people with your exact same problem many times over and might put information specific to that game on the website.
afaik, there are 3 options to getting a sound card configured under linux: the free oss sound drivers that come with the linux kernel, the alsa drivers and the commercial oss sound drivers.
your libraries can still be wrong.
it approximates the gaps between textures by sampling the color of the four closest (above, below, left and right) texels.
unlike vmware, win4lin only does windows 95/98/me, but this turns out to be better for gamers.
this basically means that versions of wine that are released past the date of the re-licensing can no longer be used by winex.
it approximates the gaps between textures by sampling the color of the four closest (above, below, left and right) texels.
the interpreter reads data files and provides the gaming interface.
if the game segfaults every time you run it, or is incredibly slow, a saved game file won't be of much help.
on ms windows, when the geforce beat out its main competing radeon, the review claimed that the radeon generally had better visuals.
if you're in the market to buy a sound card, get something that will take you a second to configure.
by receiving feedback on this howto (even if i don't have the time to answer), you make me feel like i'm doing something useful.
gcc will then `bolt on' code from/usr/lib/sdl.a and /usr/lib/libm.a whenever it sees a math function during the compilation process.
it is pitch dark and you're likely to be eaten by a grue.
however, it's possible to give a program all the hardware resources it needs.
although some games may work with wine, you'll probably get the most success with winex: its directx support is constantly improving.
some examples of games written in agi would be leisure suit larry i (ega), space quest i and ii, king's quest ii, mixed-up mother goose and others.
mike phillips (formerly of loki software) mentioned that sending in saved games to loki is definitely a good thing.
the best tool to use here is lsof, which shows which processes are accessing a file.
since the open sound system's (oss) deprecation in favour of alsa, all linux distributions i've seen now ship with alsa support as default, with oss support actually being supplied via alsa's compatability modules.
the commercial oss drivers are good when you're having trouble getting your sound card to work by free methods.
many of them arise because people don't know as much as they should about how things "work" on linux, at least, as far as games go.
but again, the driver issue makes this information unusable for us.
the second column is there because i have 2 cpu's in this machine; if you have one cpu (called up, or uniprocessor), you'll have only 1 cpu column.
although winex is commercial, they have an interesting business model.
in addition, by using the higher level libraries, a game writer can develop his game on multiple platforms, even ones that don't use xfree86.
it's said that wine has the best success when run with windows.
not counting the rogue variants, there's also a deficiency of open source rpgs too.
getting dosemu to work well is not easy, but unfortunately, for dos games it's the best avenue.
this script runs neverwinter nights from the current directory export sdl_mouse_relative=0 export sdl_video_x11_dgamouse=0 # if you do not wish to use the sdl library included in the package, remove # ./lib
the svgalib based apple2 and x based xapple2 can emulate any apple ][ variant except for the //gs.
the console is the dark non-graphical screen you look at when your computer first boots up (and you don't havexdm or gdm running).
sdl (section 3.10) and clanlib (section 3.15) applications can display on libggi but often the native drivers for these libraries are faster, however it's a good way to get sdl, clanlib, and svgalib applications to run where they would not before.
you can even run another linux under linux; useful is you want to test another distro for instance.
at the gdm login screen, you should now see "doom iii" as an option in "sessions".
when you compile a program, by default,gcc uses dynamic libraries, but you can makegcc use static libraries instead by using the -static switch.
presumably, ati doesn't want to release drivers to keep their trade secrets, well, a secret.
their website is very good, and chock full of any kind of information about scumm and playing these games under scummvm.
the "dot clock" your videocard is running at.
for example, i added the users p and wellspring to group audio on my system: audio:x:29:p,wellspring don't forget to use grpconv if you use shadow passwords (which should be the case on most recent distributions) in order to maintain a consistent group configuration.
we'll cover video card and 3d graphics terminology.
the open group finally opened up motif's license for open source operating systems, but it was too little too late.
creative never released a linux driver for these cards (and they never released programming information to linux developers), so linux users cannot use the extra 32 channels on the awe 64 and awe 64 gold.
personally, i prefer the free oss drivers, but many people swear by alsa.
they're analagous to the.dll's used by windows.
netscape has a nice graphical "point and click" newsreader too.
even though it was written to share the card between applications, i've found that esd (the enlightenment sound daemon) sometimes doesn't work correctly.
it's reported that a voodoo iii using glide2 will outperform a voodoo iii using glide3.
every once in awhile you'll see some sicko (said with respect) write a game in xlib.
if you don't have a driver loaded, you need to figure out what's been compiled into your kernel.
xfree86 4.x provides a more centralized and self-contained approach to video.
it's lgpl'd and provides joystick and opengl support as well.
remember to ask first, because core files can get very, very big.
in turn, it motivates me to write more and add to this document.
not a big deal when you're trying to run wordperfect or an old database application.
the voodoo iv and v rendered in full 32bpp color, had great aa support (section 7.4.3), featured a 2nd gpu, more memory, and was arguably the king of of video cards.
rpg's generally have a quest with a well defined ending.
because win4lin concentrates on these operating systems, reports say that it's faster and does a better job at running games under these operating system than vmware.
this project is much less far along than libggi itself, but promises to combine dri-level speeds and the stability and security unix users expect.
dri allows x clients to write 3d rendering information directly to the video card in a safe and cooperative manner.
this means that there are different builds of mesa depending on what kind of video card you have.
on the other hand, you can ask for help and the developers are very good about getting around to your answer; their vigilance is quite impressive.
sarien is under development and the developers have been very good about documenting the sarien internals if anyone wants to get involved in hacking it.
the advanced search is at http://groups.google.com/advanced_group_search.
for commercial games, this option is more fruitful than sending a core file or call stack since commercial games can't be recompiled to include debugging information.
this is legal only if you own a copy of windows which isn't currently being used on a computer.
the copies ofopenal.so distributed with games often do not support alsa, so making the game use a copy compiled yourself will allow you to use alsa natively.
unlike vmware, win4lin only does windows 95/98/me, but this turns out to be better for gamers.
however, all ati cards beyond the radeon 9200 also require a proprietary driver that will "taint" your kernel as well.
if you're playing an open source game that you compiled, make sure you have the newest version by checking the game's website.
they have an extremely high "information to space" ratio.
although playing an emulated game is sometimes not quite as fun as playing it on the native machine, and getting some of the emulators to work well can be a difficult task, they're here, and there's alot of them!
it should've been a more powerful card, with a 50mhz gpu and 8mb of ram.
pci cards can share interrupts, but certain types of high bandwidth cards simply don't like to share, including network and sound cards.
anyone who has played games like dungeons & dragons or call of cthulhu knows exactly what an rpg is.
btw, let me say that compiling your own kernel is the first step towards proficiency with linux.
they don't necessarily have to be violent, likexscavenger, a clone of the old 8-bit game lode runner.
it's an absolute show stopper for gaming.
yet game companies persist using directx and therefore limit their audience to windows users only.
the "x window user howto", and especially "man xf86config" arerequired reading.
the engine refers to the actual game itself (doom, quake, heretic2) and plays out the maps and bad guys outlined by the datafile (doom2.wad, pak0.pak, etc).
in ultima ii, you destroy the evil sorceress minax.
you can also run wine without windows.
the number of sampled pixels and which sampled pixels it uses depends on the viewing angle of the surface relative to your screen.
being a subscriber of transgaming gives three major benefits: subscribers can download convenient packaged versions of winex in deb, rpm or tar.gz format whenever they want, including updates.
often a game will have many patches (myth2) and some games are unplayable without them (heretic2).
underworld adventures provides an impressive graphics system which uses the original game files, so you'll need the original game disk to play.
they include things like text entry boxes, pulldown menus, slider bars, radio buttons and much more.
third person shooters similar to fps, but you view your character in third person and in 3d. on modern third person shooters you can usually do some really kick-butt maneuvers like jackie chan style back flips and side rolls.
these cards include the older ensoniq es1370 and newer creative pci-128.
they're kind of mysterious and have funny names, so we'll go over libraries on linux for a bit.
and it felt good, because 3dfx open sourced their drivers.
when objects are rendered into a 2d frame buffer, the rendering engine removes hidden surfaces by using the z buffer.
once upon a time, soundcards without onboard midi chips (most pci sound cards) didn't do midi.
at low levels you might get some gold pieces as a reward for winning a battle.
they simply put you in a cockpit to give you the thrill of piloting a plane.
when the texture is far away a smaller version of the texture (mip map) is used.
a more advanced way of fixing this would be to go into bios and assign irq's to specific slots.
don't forget the game's website.
for these examples, bioware's neverwinter nights will be used.
this material isn't crucial to actually getting a game working, but may help in deciding what hardware and software options are best for you.
the faq and howto are complementary in this regard, and i've tried to not reproduce their content.
the only video card that can use both glide2 (under xfree86 3.x) and glide3 (under xfree86 4.x) is the voodoo iii.
since aa is cpu intensive, it's more desirable to perform it in hardware, but if we're talking about semi-static applications, like the gimp, this really isn't an issue.
opengl provides a powerful, complete and generic feature set for 2d and 3d graphics operations.
mike phillips (formerly of loki software) mentioned that sending in saved games to loki is definitely a good thing.
right now, i'm listening to an mp3 (not a metallica mp3, of course...) with mp3blaster.
the lock can also be a "soft lock", meaning that the kernel is still functioning in some capacity.
if you want to create a derivative work or publish this howto for commercial purposes, i would appreciate it if you contact me first.
you can use the mouse to cut and paste the word "halt".
this allowed daryll strauss to port glide2 to linux which enabled xfree86 3.x users to use voodoo i, ii and iii cards under linux.
underworld adventures also provides a bunch of tools for you to display the level maps, tools for examining uw1 conversation scripts and more.
basically, it turns many smaller separate writes to the video card into a single write (a burst).
creative never released a linux driver for these cards (and they never released programming information to linux developers), so linux users cannot use the extra 32 channels on the awe 64 and awe 64 gold.
this should clear up many problems, including consoles hosed by an svgalib or ncurses based game.
if you have your heart set to buy the best card for linux, you'll want to go with the geforce 5900.
moreover, a game writer who uses libraries like opengl, ggi or sdl will write a game which will trivially compile on windows, linux and a multitude of other os's.
however, it's possible to give a program all the hardware resources it needs.
the idea was that 2d rendering was handled by a high quality 2d video card (matrox was immensely popular at the time)
i prefer console tools more, so i use tin, but slrn is also popular.
i happen to be a fan of this library and of graphical console games in general; they are extremely fast, fullscreen and compelling.
there's a good framebuffer howto available from ldp.
a "real computer" provides an operating system many things, including a cpu, i/o channels, memory, a bios to provide low level access to motherboard and i/o resources, etc.
if the magic sysrq key sequence doesn't shut your system down gracefully, your kernel has crashed hard and you'll need to use the reset or power button to recover.
the system shock engine was optimized for sophistication, while doom's engine was optimized for throwing lots of monsters at you; a completely different appoach.
as root, change to the "/usr/share/xsessions" directory and take a look at its contents.
the console was hosed with a quasi-graphics screen.
no code gets inserted at run time; the code is completely self-contained.
sometimes a game will exit abnormally and your console will get `hosed'.
you'll see something like: #0 printf (format=0x80484a4 "z is %d.\n") at printf.c:30 #1 0x8048431 in display (z=5) at try1.c:11 #2 0x8048406 in main () at try1.c:6 it may be quite long, but use your mouse to cut and paste this information into a file.
it uses the virtual machine approach to running windows applications, so you'll get a big window from which you can boot windows and run all kinds of windows applications.
you will never see non hardware accelerated fsaa.
because their linux guy quit the company, reel deal slots is their first, and so far, last release for linux.
computer based board games simulate some kind of board game you'd play on a table top with friends, like monopoly, mille bourne, chess or checkers.
this could be something real like a fighter jet or something imaginary like a mechanized warrior combat unit.
fwiw, i've been able to finish many of the games that are listed as 90% done with no problems.
the voodoo iv and v rendered in full 32bpp color, had great aa support (section 7.4.3), featured a 2nd gpu, more memory, and was arguably the king of of video cards.
we'll run through the different gaming libraries you'll see under linux.
in these games, you point at an object (say, a book) and can choose from a pull-down list of functions.
you'll see something like: #0 printf (format=0x80484a4 "z is %d.\n") at printf.c:30 #1 0x8048431 in display (z=5) at try1.c:11 #2 0x8048406 in main () at try1.c:6 it may be quite long, but use your mouse to cut and paste this information into a file.
kill all non-essential processes (you'll have to do this as root) by using the startup scripts on your system.
you can use strace to determine where kill-metallica was looking for the library and make a symlink from/usr/local/include/libmp3.so.2 to wherever kill-metallica was looking for the library file.
the compiler will try to optimise the resulting binary, giving some increase in performance.
whereas opengl is open source, lower level and compiles under a multitude of operating systems, d3d is proprietary, higher level and only compiles on windows.
cd to/usr/games/nwn, or wherever you installed it and take a look at the files.
underworld adventures provides an impressive graphics system which uses the original game files, so you'll need the original game disk to play.
the compiler will try to optimise the resulting binary, giving some increase in performance.
however, 3dfx's late release of the voodoo iv and v coupled with the fact that the geforce could be had for half the price meant that 3dfx was sinking fast.
when you picked up an item, the background would be redrawn without the item appearing.
support as of june 2002, svgalib support radeon cards is shaky.
most modern 3d accelerated video cards can do trilinear filtering in hardware with no performance hit.
however, they're really incomplete, and effectively, unusable.
if my sound card is pci, the preferred way of fixing this would be to simply move one of the cards to a different slot and hope the bios sorts things out.
actually, i cooked this example up because i wanted to show you what an irq conflict looks like.
the canonical example would be tomb raider.
this basically means that versions of wine that are released past the date of the re-licensing can no longer be used by winex.
the xterm from which you run glxgears will display "x frames in y seconds =
role playing game (aka rpg) anyone who has played games like dungeons & dragons or call of cthulhu knows exactly what an rpg is.
i've had expensive altec lansing speakers perform only slightly better than el-cheapo speakers.
not counting the rogue variants, there's also a deficiency of open source rpgs too.
definitions: types of games not everyone knows the different types of games that are out there, so in an effort to form a common language that we can all use, i'll run through each game type and provide a very brief history.
non-subscribers can browse the forums, but only subscribers can post (and therefore, ask for support).
as you can imagine, this is extremely cpu intensive.
it's reported that a voodoo iii using glide2 will outperform a voodoo iii using glide3.
the transgaming website has a few user support forums.
their effort is above and beyond the call of duty: frédéric delanoy, moritz muehlenhoff , mike phillips, ioan rogers i would also like to thank the following people for sending in comments and corrections.
btw, let me say that compiling your own kernel is the first step towards proficiency with linux.
i'd also appreciate either a copy of whatever it is you're doing or a spinach, garlic, mushroom, feta cheese and artichoke heart pizza.
while some games are written in xlib, like the doom editor yadex, xlib itself is not a serious game writing library.
you should definitely ask before sending a save game file because they tend to be long, but gaming companies usually have lots of bandwidth.
the program can simulate your opponent.
let's use strace to find out where the program was looking for the data file.
the commercial oss drivers are good when you're having trouble getting your sound card to work by free methods.
sci: script interpreter or sierra creative interpreter (sierra) the newer sierra graphical adventure games (we're talking about the late 80's here) used an interpreter named sci.
these are some resources for linux gamers no matter what kind of game you enjoy to play.
if the sound card works when you're root but not any other user, you probably have a permissions problem.
trilinear filtering samples eight pixels and interpolates them before rendering.
when it wants to set an irq, give it some bogus instructions that lets it think it set an irq.
comment out the lines containing the wm or desktop manager with a pound sign (#) and place your game on a new line with any command line arguments you want to pass.
he recently released a new game (a linux version is not available) but since the decline of adventuring, he has pretty much kept out of the gaming industry.
the canonical example would be tomb raider.
for instance, at a low resolution you may get only a very slight hit by using trilinear filtering instead of bilinear filtering.
it's well supported by linux with high quality but proprietary drivers.
jzip is very portable; it compiles on all unices, os/2, atari st and dos.
as of june 2003, expect to pay $89.99 without printed docs and $99.99 with printed docs.
these games can be played usingsarienon> , an open source interpreter for agi games.
you may even see your hands or weapon at the bottom of the screen.
so if you don't see your sound card's driver with lsmod, your card probably isn't configured yet.
the aim is to keep rewind mit/x11 based so that companies like transgaming can offer wine based products.
not only did we have the best video cards, but the drivers were all open source.
the nwn library directories have been prepended to the search path, so now the linker can find libmss.so.6 in the "./miles" directory, and also finds the local copy of libsdl first, no longer using the system copy.
this api provides a way to install directx from within an application to simplify game installation.
another nice little trick is for games that use openal for their sound output (e.g. unreal based games: ut, postal, rune, etc.).
in the oven you see a brown paper bag.
it was the first hardware accelerated card, but only rendered 3d; it had to be piggybacked with a 2d video card.
don't discount them; they're very cheap (like 10 or 20 bucks), support bleeding edge sound cards and take a lot of guesswork out of the configuring process.
except for a few details, a program written in sdl will compile under linux, ms windows, beos, macos, macos x, solaris, irix, freebsd, qnx and osf.
if you don't have a driver loaded, you need to figure out what's been compiled into your kernel.
the data files are the actual game itself, similar to the relationship between first person shooters (section 2.7) and wad files.
gcc looks for libraries in the ``standard system directories'' plus any directories you specify with the-l option.
even when ati open sourced its video card driver, they played the "we'll make linux developers write our drivers for us" game.
ldd shows all the libraries a dynamic executable relies on, and shows you where they are.
and it felt good, because 3dfx open sourced their drivers.
however, that changed under x 4.x with dri (direct rendering infrastructure .
sdl (section 3.10) and clanlib (section 3.15) applications can display on libggi but often the native drivers for these libraries are faster, however it's a good way to get sdl, clanlib, and svgalib applications to run where they would not before.
right now, i'm listening to an mp3 (not a metallica mp3, of course...) with mp3blaster.
graphics rendering has 3 players: the client application (like quake 3), the x server and the hardware (the graphics card).
at the *very* least, the author will be interested in the call stack when the game crashed.
you should definitely have a good configuration in order to run it; they claim the minimum is a 500mhz x86 cpu with 128mb ram, but a faster processor and at least 256mb ram seem to be the bare minimum if you want reasonable performance.
if hardware acceleration is not possible for a specific task, opengl falls back on software rendering.
beyond the 9200, you need to use ati's binary only proprietary drivers, available in rpm format from ati's website.
wine does not provide the dos api, so you can't use it to run dos applications.
none of the games which use glide2 will work with glide3.
i used to be a fan of the creative soundblaster awe 32, awe 64 and awe 64 gold soundcards.
the developers have done a fantastic job of documenting and faqing their application.
this was a good time for linux.
oh, you'll want to run them as root since you'll be asking for information from processes that may be owned by root.
you play a character, sometimes more than one, characterized by traits (eg strength, dexterity), skills (eg explosives, basket weaving, mechanics) and properties (levels, cash).
graphical console games written using the frame buffer suffer from the same deficiencies of the svga library: not all hardware is supported and the code will only run on linux.
for instance, at a low resolution you may get only a very slight hit by using trilinear filtering instead of bilinear filtering.
the t&l is the process of translating all the 3d world information (position, distance, and light sources) into the 2d image that is actually displayed on screen.
running quake iii and quitting normally fixed the problem.
alternatively, some isa cards can be set to use a specific irq using jumpers on the card itself.
for gaming you might want to look at winex (section 10.5.3).
the developers take wine (see section 10.5.1) and add directx / directdraw support.
the rewards increase correspondingly.
they have also more functionality than the publicly available tarball: the latter is an older version which lacks some of the newest features, like support for copy protected programs.
graphics rendering has 3 players: the client application (like quake 3), the x server and the hardware (the graphics card).
this excellently done page has many nice links for interactive fiction fans.
while you need the original game files to play sshp, it should work with the system shock demo, which is freely available.
but again, the driver issue makes this information unusable for us.
when playing games from binary, your library woes will be either be thatld.so can't find the library or the library doesn't exist on your system.
this allowed them to write game data files in a cross platform manner, since only the engine itself, the z-machine, would be platform dependent.
i prefer console tools more, so i use tin, but slrn is also popular.
however, 3dfx's late release of the voodoo iv and v coupled with the fact that the geforce could be had for half the price meant that 3dfx was sinking fast.
you are given a scenario and can interact with the world you're placed in: you are in a room.
but at high resolutions, the performance hit may be enormous.
if direct rendering is disabled, then your x configuration is definitely faulty.
if you don't know what netnews (usenet) is, then this is definitely worth 30 minutes of your time to learn about.
they all use the same e-mu 8000 synthesis chip which enables them to play 32 voices simultaneously (they have 32 "channels").
configuration is also a bit funky; this emulator would benefit from an svga or x based configuration tool.
the text characters could look like gibberish.
until this point, ati had always been an innovative (they developed their own 3d acceleration chips in 1996, about the same time as 3dfx), but sleepy graphics chipset manufacturer.
note that explicit modelines are no longer necessary, since xfree 4.0.1 and up computes modetimings automatically based on your monitor's and video card's capabilities.
you can use strace to determine where kill-metallica was looking for the library and make a symlink from/usr/local/include/libmp3.so.2 to wherever kill-metallica was looking for the library file.
you'll have something like 10 processes running.
you can play adventure yourself (actually, a descendent); it comes with “bsd games” on most linux distros.
the newer sierra graphical adventure games (we're talking about the late 80's here) used an interpreter named sci.
the exult team has also been hard at work creating a map editor, exult studio, and a script compiler that will let users create their own rpg in the ultima style.
they all use the same e-mu 8000 synthesis chip which enables them to play 32 voices simultaneously (they have 32 "channels").
strace tells you what system calls are being made, with what arguments, and what their return values are.
that's the way distros do things.
nvidia uses a convenient combined driver architecture; their driver will support the tnt 2 all the way up to the geforce 5900.
there aren't many graphical adventures written natively for linux.
the important difference being that since opengl is open (and directx is closed), games written in opengl are much easier to port to and co-develop on linux than games written using directx. mesa is a free implementation of the opengl api, designed and written by brian paul.
even lightweight wms, like twm, rob your cpu of clock cycles (and in twm's case, even full screen games will have a frame around the window).
the older sierra dos graphical adventure games used a scripting language named agi (adventure gaming interface).
+set r_gldriver libgr.so.1 #exec ut #lsdldoom -server 2 #exec tribes2 exec /usr/bin/enlightenment you'll usually see a window or desktop manager being executed from this file (gnome or kde).
i still remember my friend gabe rosa emailing me with just "look at /." and seeing the news.
once i had to kill quake iii in a hurry, so i performed actl-alt-backspace.
this allowed them to write game data files in a cross platform manner, since only the engine itself, the z-machine, would be platform dependent.
because win4lin concentrates on these operating systems, reports say that it's faster and does a better job at running games under these operating system than vmware.
use it, and you'll be a much happier person.
often a game will have many patches (myth2) and some games are unplayable without them (heretic2).
cd to/usr/games/nwn, or wherever you installed it and take a look at the files.
the version at sourceforge is bleeding edge but guaranteed to be not broken, however it may have glitches, like unfinished paragraphs.
the library doesn't exist on your system.
trilinear filtering is capable of producing fine visuals, but it only samples from a square area which in some cases is not the ideal method.
pci cards are much easier to deal with than isa since you don't need to tell their drivers about which system resources (irq, dma, i/o addresses) to use.
if you do this correctly, then in principle, there's no way for the poor application to know whether it's really accessing hardware or tricked by being given resources which simulate hardware.
it only runs on x86 architectures.
when objects are rendered into a 2d frame buffer, the rendering engine removes hidden surfaces by using the z buffer.
you can hit alt-sysrq-h for a very terse help screen.
despite the faster 100mhz core, the banshee was outperformed by the voodoo ii because its multi-texturing unit was removed, like with the rush.
the open group finally opened up motif's license for open source operating systems, but it was too little too late.
using scottfree and any of the scott adams data files which can be downloaded from scott's website you can enjoy these classics.
second, the awe 64 and awe 64 gold can play 64 voices simultaneously, but this is done in software.
to find out what libraries a game uses, we can use the "ldd" command.
logging out and back in don't always work, but there are a few things that might: if you don't see any character on the screen as you type in, your terminal settings may be wrong.
not all linux distributions are supported: newest redhat's, mandrake's and suse's are, but you're out of luck if you have an other version and/or distribution (like debian).
cpu type video card x version average fps compiling mesa and dri modules yourself can increase your fps by 15 fps; quite a performance boost!
it's used for a number of purposes, like making adjacent textures blend smoothly and making textures viewed from an angle (think of looking at a billboard from an extreme angle) look realistic.
unless you plan on compiling your games from source code, you'll mainly be interested in dynamic libraries.
most games don't need the low-level interface that xlib provides.
the geforce will be stronger on linux.
that sometimes works when your console is very badly hosed.
other sources of information xdpyinfo gives cool stuff, like x version and loaded extensions (invaluable when trying to see what's missing, like glx, dri, xfree86-vidmode, etc.).
it's informally called the "dust buster" because of noise its fan makes.
unfortunately, it can take alot of effort to get dosemu to work, and of jan 2002, the sound code is somewhat broken.
now, run the game and do whatever you did to crash the program and dump a core again.
if you're a game writer, please consider using cross platform libraries and stay away from directx. a company named realtechvr started an open source project, directx port,  which, like wine, provides a direct3d emulation layer that implements direct3d calls.
on paper, it's simply the more impressive card.
then, as root, add your non-root user to the audio group in /etc/group.
if you're getting like 1 fps, then your system isn't using hardware 3d acceleration.
second, the action takes place in first person.
but 3d information (see glide2,section 3.1) would be passed to the voodoo i and rendered, using the voodoo's fast hardware to perform the necessary graphics calculations.
the 3d rendering information doesn't even have to be hardware accelerated.
on debian, the startup scripts for run-level 2 are located in /etc/rc2.d/. you can kill a service in an orderly manner by sending its startup script the `stop' command: # cd /etc/rc2.d # ./ntpd stop another (radical) option is to simply put yourself in single-user mode with # telinit 1 this will even get rid of getty; your system will only be running whatever is absolutely crucial to its operation.
said that wabi for solaris is more stable than linux.
the idea was that 2d rendering was handled by a high quality 2d video card (matrox was immensely popular at the time)
i assume a working knowledge of linux, so i use some topics like runlevels and modules without defining them.
developers have reported that svgalib works on the radeon 7500, radeon qd (64mb ddr model) but has problems on the radeon ve.
this example will show you how to log in to doom3.
pixels are rectangular objects, so drawing an angled line or curve with them results in a 'stair step' effect, also called the 'jaggies'.
these days: all geforce cards require a proprietary driver which will "taint" your kernel.
arcade style games attempt to simulate the arcade games themselves.
dri gets the x server out of the way so the 3d driver (mesa or opengl) can talk directly to the hardware.
every once in awhile you'll see some sicko (said with respect) write a game in xlib.
while nvidia was putting real r&d into their cards, 3dfx was simply adding more and faster ram.
you can use wine `with windows', which means that wine uses libraries that actually come with microsoft windows itself.
if there are enough questions (or even protests) i'll add more basic information to this document.
my web browser of choice, opera (available athttp://www.opera.com) allows you to use the right mouse button to select a portion of text and left click the selection to translate it into another language.
it was the first hardware accelerated card, but only rendered 3d; it had to be piggybacked with a 2d video card.
the program can simulate your opponent.
this improves a game's visuals, but can also dramatically degrade performance.
although he himself was inspired by the first piece of interactive fiction, adventure, scott brought adventuring to the masses.
this is legal only if you own a copy of windows which isn't currently being used on a computer.
for open source games, you can help the author by giving a corefile or stack trace.
now we can try to locate mind.dat and move it into /usr/share, or better, create a symbolic link.
while some games are written in xlib, like the doom editor yadex, xlib itself is not a serious game writing library.
ggi is a project which aims to implement a graphics abstraction layer in lower level code, put graphics hardware support into a common codebase, and bring higher stability and portability to graphics applications.
more important than fps is having a constant fps for small and large windows.
they're analagous to the.dll's used by windows.
a few notes: first, the soundblaster awe howto is very out of date.
second, the awe 64 and awe 64 gold can play 64 voices simultaneously, but this is done in software.
a google search should turn up alot of information on this problem.
the scenario can be peaceful, like running a successful city (simcity), or not, like illegal drug selling operation (drugwars) or an all-out war strategy game like myth ii.
1108 p 6w chr 14,3 662302 /dev/dsp fuser is similar; but it lets you send a signal to any process
however, if you must have usb support or run linux on a platform other than x86, vmware is your only option.
the system shock engine was optimized for sophistication, while doom's engine was optimized for throwing lots of monsters at you; a completely different appoach.
without their help, there would be more typos and mistakes than you could shake a stick at: michael mcdonnell 1.3.
remember to ask first, because core files can get very, very big.
directsetup this api provides a way to install directx from within an application to simplify game installation.
many modern 3d accelerated cards have a z buffer in their video ram, which speeds things up considerably, but z buffering can also be done by the application's rendering engine.
scummvm is rock solid, and allows you to purchase scumm based lucas arts games, copy the data files to your hard drive and play them under linux.
the components of directx are: directdraw directdraw gives direct access to video memory, like dri, so 2d graphics can be blitted directly to the video card.
if you want to do things like convert a record lp to digital format, then your choice of a soundcard with a professional grade a/d converter is absolutely crucial.
it's informally called the "dust buster" because of noise its fan makes.
however, the file is generated from a text file/etc/ld.so.conf which you can edit.
but life was still good for linux.
ati, together with nvidia, played king of hill.
i'm not much for card/gambling games, but this game is impressive!
vertex data doesn't have to be encoded/decoded via glx.
ludvig strigeus was able to reverse engineer the scumm format and write an interpreter for scumm based games that compiles under linux and win32 named scummvm .
running a game without a wm or de depends on how you access x. if you usually log in to a virtual console and start x with "startx" try the following: modify ~/.xinitrc, which tells x what to run upon starting.
the voodoo banshee was released in september 1998 as a combined 2d/3d card, like the rush.
this material isn't crucial to actually getting a game working, but may help in deciding what hardware and software options are best for you.
logic games usually simulate some well known logic puzzle like master mind or the game where you have put sliding numbered tiles in order inside a box.
the file could be a library: % ./exult ./exult: error while loading shared library: libsdl-1.2.so.0: cannot load shared object file: no such file or directory or it could be some kind of data file, like a wad or map file: % qf-client-sdl ip address 192.168.0.2:27001 udp initialize error: w_loadwadfile: couldn't load gfx.wad suppose gfx.wad is already on my system, but couldn't be found because it isn't in the right directory.
the 3d rendering information doesn't even have to be hardware accelerated.
check the game's website for patches whether you have a problem running the game or not; there may be an update for a security problem that you may not even be aware of.
the file could be a library: % ./exult ./exult: error while loading shared library: libsdl-1.2.so.0: cannot load shared object file: no such file or directory or it could be some kind of data file, like a wad or map file: % qf-client-sdl ip address 192.168.0.2:27001 udp initialize error: w_loadwadfile: couldn't load gfx.wad suppose gfx.wad is already on my system, but couldn't be found because it isn't in the right directory.
directaudio is a combination of 2 audio api's, directsound and directmusic, which allows direct access to the sound card for sound and music playback.
linuxgames.com has a nice loki timeline athttp://www.linuxgames.com/articles/lokitimeline tribsoft released jagged alliance 2, an excellent rpg/strat which claimed 2+ weeks of my life.
let's use strace to find out where the program was looking for the data file.
clanlib builds a generic game development framework, giving you easy handling of resources, network object replication, graphical user interfaces (gui) with theme support, game scripting and more.
but if you're going to give it a try, you're more likely to have success with vmware.
aa uses cpu intensive filtering to smooth out these jagged edges.
if you search hard enough, you can find file copies of the roms for the apple ][, ][+, ][e, ][c and //gs.
commercial games will have a printed manual and maybe some readme files on the cd the game came on.
directinput gives support for gaming input devices such as joysticks.
they're kind of mysterious and have funny names, so we'll go over libraries on linux for a bit.
as you can see, this gives us slighly different results.
as of version 3.1, the directx 8 support is nearly complete, but this may not be the case with older directx versions (are consequently older games).
every post made to usenet gets archived at google's database at http://groups.google.com.
va linux, the largest linux server vendor, put nvidia into their machines.
if hardware acceleration is working, the fps for glxgears should be nearly independent of window size.
libggi applications run on svgalib, fb, and x servers among others.
for instance, they can vote for things like "improve support for copy protected programs", "better installshield support" or "improve directx 8.0 support".
worse still, the voodoo v's 2nd gpu was unused by the linux driver (and to this day, the voodoo v is functionally equivalent to the single gpu voodoo iv on linux).
exult is written in c++ using sdl, so it will compile on any platform that can compile sdl programs.
they wrote many graphical adventures using scumm, like their famous monkey island series (all three).
you might also try a virtual machine like win4lin or vmware instead of an emulator.
directshow provides support for movie files like avi and mpg.
as of june 2003, expect to pay $89.99 without printed docs and $99.99 with printed docs.
ggi is a project which aims to implement a graphics abstraction layer in lower level code, put graphics hardware support into a common codebase, and bring higher stability and portability to graphics applications.
os independent window event (mouse, keyboard, etc.) handler.
otherwise, all you'll get is software rendering.
if you have success using dosemu, i would like to hear from you.
at first, things were still simple.
if you want to start putting dynamic libraries in /home/joecool/privatelibs, you'd add this directory to /etc/ld.so.conf.
once i had to kill quake iii in a hurry, so i performed actl-alt-backspace.
mip mapping can be used regardless of filtering method (section 7.4.6).
compared with agi games, sci adventures have better music support, a more complex engine and loads of bells and whistles.
in contrast to dynamic libraries which provide code while the application runs, static libraries contain code which gets linked (inserted) into the program while it's being compiled.
secondly, svgalib is video card dependent–if your video card isn't supported by svgalib, you're out of luck.
however, if you must have usb support or run linux on a platform other than x86, vmware is your only option.
note that since this file was written, xfree86 has been patched to automatically detect your video ram base address and size and set up the mtrrs.
this should let input characters echo again.
acknowledgements thanks goes out to these people for extensive comments, corrections, and diffs.
a rendered scene is basically made up of polygons and lines.
meta gaming websites these are some resources for linux gamers no matter what kind of game you enjoy to play.
wine does not provide the dos api, so you can't use it to run dos applications.
i still remember my friend gabe rosa emailing me with just "look at /." and seeing the news.
the important difference being that since opengl is open (and directx is closed), games written in opengl are much easier to port to and co-develop on linux than games written using directx. 3.4.
he'll still support ja2 but don't expect patches or updates.
but your process table will be a ghost town, and all that extra cpu will go straight to your game.
graphical adventures are, at heart, text adventures on steroids.
nvidia's party line was they license some of their gl code from another company, and is thus non-releasable.
worse still, the voodoo v's 2nd gpu was unused by the linux driver (and to this day, the voodoo v is functionally equivalent to the single gpu voodoo iv on linux).
unlike xlib (section 3.8), sdl is very suited for game programming.
the king of video cards worked with linux developers.
3dfx was getting ready to release a new voodoo v featuring 4 gpu's which would've trounced the ati and nvidia offerings, as well as a new card code named "rampage" which reportedly would've put them firmly back as the king of the hill.
this module (and its device file/dev/3dfx) allows glide2 graphical hardware acceleration for non-root users of non-setuid applications.
3dfx was getting ready to release a new voodoo v featuring 4 gpu's which would've trounced the ati and nvidia offerings, as well as a new card code named "rampage" which reportedly would've put them firmly back as the king of the hill.
logic games usually simulate some well known logic puzzle like master mind or the game where you have put sliding numbered tiles in order inside a box.
they stopped selling linux games and distributions at around the same time loki software declared bankruptcy, which is a shame because they had the lowest prices on linux games i've ever seen.
when i talk about 'performance hits', keep in mind that the performance hit depends on what resolution you're running at.
this means that when you get opengl from sgi, if you want any kind of hardware acceleration at all, it must be opengl written and compiled specifically for some graphics card.
back in the 80's, they were little more than text adventures which showed a screen of static graphics.
if you want to reboot but the `o' key doesn't work, try using halt.
while it's not officially certified (that would take more money than an open source project has), it's an almost fully compliant opengl implementation conforming to the arb specifications.
examples would be abuse for linux and the original duke nukem.
this example will show you how to log in to doom3.
it provides support for a few cards which are not well supported by dri like the ati rage pro family, s3 virge (although anyone using this for gaming is, well, nuts), and an open source tnt/tnt2 driver (which is very incomplete).
just like opengl, mesa makes use of hardware acceleration whenever possible.
for instance, they can vote for things like "improve support for copy protected programs", "better installshield support" or "improve directx 8.0 support".
dynamic libraries, also called a “shared library”, provide object code for an application while it's running.
it's reported that mesa is even faster than sgi's own opengl implementation.
nvidia came back with fists swinging, and this was all too much for 3dfx.
this file will have almost everything there is to know about your x system.
ultima i was released in 1987 and was the game that launched 9 (depending on how you want to count them) very popular sequels, finishing with ultima ix: ascension.
directdraw is like the graphical component of sdl, but the direct video card access is done by dri rather than sdl.
this is when pixels make, what should be a smooth curve or line, jagged.
sarien is under development and the developers have been very good about documenting the sarien internals if anyone wants to get involved in hacking it.
if you want to create a derivative work or publish this howto for commercial purposes, i would appreciate it if you contact me first.
linux gamers would either keep their open source voodoos, get an open source radeon or a closed source geforce.
frankly, i've had many cards and i can't tell the difference between any of them for gaming.
however, the original data files are kept proprietary.
although winex is commercial, they have an interesting business model.
error:can't open data file 'mind.dat'.
you'll want to get something with a separate sub-woofer; this does make a difference at a cost of extra power and connector wires.
trilinear filtering samples eight pixels and interpolates them before rendering.
direct rendering disabled where xxxxxxx depends on which video card you have.
the scenario can be peaceful, like running a successful city (simcity), or not, like illegal drug selling operation (drugwars) or an all-out war strategy game like myth ii.
you'll know this worked if you hear the computer beep after a few seconds (this is bios saying "i'm ok" during a power on cycle).
afaik, there are 3 options to getting a sound card configured under linux: the free oss sound drivers that come with the linux kernel, the alsa drivers and the commercial oss sound drivers.
if you can ssh in, reboot or halt the system.
a few seconds later, hit alt-sysrq-u. this will attempt to remount all your mounted filesystems as read-only).
here is how you can get the call stack at barf-time: sometimes distros set up their os so that core files (which are mainly useful to programmers) aren't generated.
if you can, an orderly shutdown is preferable; use "halt" or "shutdown".
you can see i have an irq conflict between the soundcard (soundblaster) and the network card (eth0).
these days sims and strats are nearly indistinguishable, but a long time ago, sims were real time while strats were turn based.
so to use these two libraries, you would passgcc the -lsdl -lm options.
needless to say, this only applies if your game crashes reproducably at a certain point.
the faq takes the opposite approach; they mainly focus on the games themselves, including game specific problems and where to get linux games in the first place.
3dfx removed the multi-texturing unit from the rush, and it was outperformed by the voodoo i.
this allows all non-root users to use dri.
$@ this script sets up some environment variables, then launches the game binary with whatever command line options we added.
without their help, there would be more typos and mistakes than you could shake a stick at: michael mcdonnell
in nethack you need to retrieve the amulet of yendor for your god.
no code gets inserted at run time; the code is completely self-contained.
very quickly, a core file (aka core dump) is a file that holds the "state" of the program at the moment it crashes.
when you picked up an item, the background would be redrawn without the item appearing.
this allows us to run graphical things in console, like allowing us to choose any font we
for these examples, bioware's neverwinter nights will be used.
it's not very cheap (about 300$ for the workstation version), but you can get a 30 day evaluation copy.
kegs boots all apple ii variants, and supports all of the apple ]['s graphics modes.
first of all, you should try an emulator.
this increases efficiency in writing to the video card and can speed up your graphics by 250% or more.
this is awkward for modern day use, since a game like warcraft which everyone knows as a strat, would be a sim by definition.
kill all non-essential processes (you'll have to do this as root) by using the startup scripts on your system.
want the console to display (which is normally set by bios).
you'll need to purchase a copy of ultima 7 to play.
you'll know this worked if you hear the computer beep after a few seconds (this is bios saying "i'm ok" during a power on cycle).
in addition to run-time translation of the win32 api to posix/x11 (it runs windows applications on linux), wine also does compile-time tranlation of the win32 api to posix/x11 (it compiles windows application source code on linux).
if you search hard enough, you can find file copies of the roms for the apple ][, ][+, ][e, ][c and //gs.
if you can't ssh into the system, you'll need to use the "magic sysrq key" which is documented in/usr/src/linux/documentation/sysrq.txt.
next there are the `point and click adventures' which basically have no text interface at all, and often have dynamic graphics, like a cat wandering around the room while you're deciding what to do next.
when you pressenter, a newline doesn't get echo'ed to the screen.
first of all, it's probably not the game, it's probably your setup.
the implementation tries to use hardware acceleration for various graphics operations whenever available, which depends on what videocard you have in you computer.
for instance, while nwn does not itself depend onlibnvidia-tls.so , the nvidia supplied libgl on my system does.
getting dosemu to work well is not easy, but unfortunately, for dos games it's the best avenue.
directdraw is like the graphical component of sdl, but the direct video card access is done by dri rather than sdl.
so when xwininfo asks you to click on the window you want the information on, click on your background.
you can even run another linux under linux; useful is you want to test another distro for instance.
if you're getting like 1 fps, then your system isn't using hardware 3d acceleration.
the version at sourceforge is bleeding edge but guaranteed to be not broken, however it may have glitches, like unfinished paragraphs.
most modern 3d accelerated video cards can do trilinear filtering in hardware with no performance hit.
on debian, the startup scripts for run-level 2 are located in /etc/rc2.d/. you can kill a service in an orderly manner by sending its startup script the `stop' command: # cd /etc/rc2.d # ./ntpd stop another (radical) option is to simply put yourself in single-user mode with # telinit 1 this will even get rid of getty; your system will only be running whatever is absolutely crucial to its operation.
it runs under x at any color depth, and supports changeable memory sizes, joysticks, and sound.
by the way, loki now has a utility that searches for loki software on your hard drive and automatically updates them.
you can among others use it to run a ms windows os and launch your favourite game there.
it's actually a meta-library, meaning that not only is it a graphics library which hides the details of xlib programming, it provides an easy interface for sound, music and event handling.
as a last note, the only systematic linux video card benchmarking effort i'm aware of was done, unfortunately, in march 2001, between a radeon 32 ddr and a geforce 2.
at low levels you might get some gold pieces as a reward for winning a battle.
you may hear disk activity.
most commercial linux games will be dynamically linked against various lgpl libraries, such as openal or sdl.
a few seconds later, use alt-sysrq-b to reboot the system.
unfortunately, it can take alot of effort to get dosemu to work, and of jan 2002, the sound code is somewhat broken.
see the man pages for lsof and fuser; they're very useful.
much of the funkyness like kernel modules for non-root access of video boards is, thankfully, gone.
for example, you can type "ps ax", and you're sure to have an `h', `a', `l' and a `t' somewhere on the screen.
even better, it was their first combined 2d/3d card, meaning that it freed up a valuable pci slot (most pc's only had a couple of pci slots back then) but the rush wasn't as popular.
any graphics programming in x ultimately makes use of the xlib library.
first, svgalib executables need to be run by root or be setuid root, however, the library releases root status immediately after the executable begins to run.
if you have good bandwidth, ask the author if he would like the core file that his program dumped.
the current radeon 9800 barely beats out the geforce 5900 in benchmarks and card specs, but linux users won't benefit from this because of driver issues..
i assume a working knowledge of linux, so i use some topics like runlevels and modules without defining them.
for this howto, we'll assume that you're more of a gamer than a studio recording engineer.
it's lgpl'd and provides joystick and opengl support as well.
for instance, when you magnify a picture, you'll notice lines that were once smooth become jagged (try it with the gimp).
clanlib builds a generic game development framework, giving you easy handling of resources, network object replication, graphical user interfaces (gui) with theme support, game scripting and more.
now, run the game and do whatever you did to crash the program and dump a core again.
like sarien, freesci has many graphics targets including sdl, xlib and ggi, so this program can compile and run under an incredible number of platforms.
scummvm is rock solid, and allows you to purchase scumm based lucas arts games, copy the data files to your hard drive and play them under linux.
back then, text adventures were self contained executables on a disk or casette.
this file will have almost everything there is to know about your x system.
the first adventure game was adventure (actually “advent”, written on a pdp-1 in 1972).
sarien was written in sdl, so it should run on any platform that can compile sdl programs.
note that explicit modelines are no longer necessary, since xfree 4.0.1 and up computes modetimings automatically based on your monitor's and video card's capabilities.
also, even if you just add extra libraries to your system, you must update ld.so.cache to reflect the presence of the new libraries.
the tnt/tnt2 driver is based on reverse-engineering of the obfuscated source code release of the x 3.3 drivers by nvidia.
the text characters could look like gibberish.
if your game came from a distro make sure there's not an update rpm/deb for the game.
if you absolutely only want open source drivers on your system, the radeon 9200 is the best card you can buy.
if you absolutely only want open source drivers on your system, the radeon 9200 is the best card you can buy.
this is when pixels make, what should be a smooth curve or line, jagged.
this should clear up many problems, including consoles hosed by an svgalib or ncurses based game.
later on, the sophisticated graphical adventures had your character roaming around the screen, and you could even use a mouse, but the interface remained purely text.
we had a card that was almost neck-to-neck with nvidia, our drivers were open source, and in december 1999, id software gave us a huge gift: they open sourced the quake i codebase.
in march 1998, 3dfx released their voodoo ii, with its 3.6gb/sec memory bandwith, 12mb of video memory and 90mhz core.
on the linux platform, we have heretic 2 and heavy metal fakk2.
although he himself was inspired by the first piece of interactive fiction, adventure, scott brought adventuring to the masses.
the geforce will be stronger on linux.
wabi is awfully expensive for what it does.
therefore, winex will now be based on rewind (section 10.5.2).
the console is the dark non-graphical screen you look at when your computer first boots up (and you don't havexdm or gdm running).
you can also specify which news server to use using the $nntp environment variable or with the file /etc/nntpserver.
we were getting our first tastes of real commercial gaming.
frotz is gpl, runs all versions of z-machine and will compile on most versions of unix.
do note that they don't archive private newsgroups, like loki software's news server.
heavyweight wms, like enlightenment, or full-blown desktop environments like gnome or kde, may produce a noticeable slow down.
nvidia has proven that they care enough about linux to write and maintain current and very high quality drivers for linux.
it holds valuable clues for the programmer to the nature of the crash -- what caused it and what the program was doing when it happened.
don't forget to browse the cd your game came on for helpful tips and advice.
these are companies that used to release games for linux but for whatever reasons aren't actively involved in linux games anymore.
rather than trusting programmers to write totally bug free, cooperative programs that access hardware, linux simply disallowed it.
if you have good bandwidth, ask the author if he would like the core file that his program dumped.
while you need the original game files to play sshp, it should work with the system shock demo, which is freely available.
if this didn't work after a few seconds, you'll definitely want to reboot the system using the following instructions.
it's painful the first time you do it, but once you do it correctly, it becomes very easy down the right, especially if you keep all your old .config files and make use of things like "make oldconfig".
at high levels, you might get a magic sword or a kick-butt assault rifle.
turn based strats are more like chess---the computer takes a turn and then the player takes a turn.
this often indicates misbehaving or faulty hardware.
much of the funkyness like kernel modules for non-root access of video boards is, thankfully, gone.
this allowed daryll strauss to port glide2 to linux which enabled xfree86 3.x users to use voodoo i, ii and iii cards under linux.
newsgroups if you don't know what netnews (usenet) is, then this is definitely worth 30 minutes of your time to learn about.
nvidia came back with fists swinging, and this was all too much for 3dfx.
just as with anything else on linux, you need to know a little more about what's going on behind the scenes with your system to be able to keep your games healthy or to diagnose and fix them when they're not.
like sarien, freesci has many graphics targets including sdl, xlib and ggi, so this program can compile and run under an incredible number of platforms.
that sometimes works when your console is very badly hosed.
also, voodoo cards need the 3dfx.o kernel module and a /dev/3dfx device file (major 107, minor 0) for non-root hardware acceleration.
so if your number is, say, about 20 fps slower than a comparable machine, chances are that glxgears is falling back on software rendering.
however, with bigger and better games on the horizon, it was only a matter of time before the voodoos would no longer be a viable graphics card for modern gaming.
the end user (you) can download the source code for free.
you can also run wine without windows.
a program can only use the special hardware accelerated features of these cards by using the glide2 library in one of two ways: directly written using glide2 (myth ii, descent iii) indirectly using mesa built with a glide2 backend to simulate opengl (rune, unreal tournament) 3dfx opened up the specifications and source code to the open source community.
a program that is allowed to directly write to hardware can crash the system in any number of ways.
like the voodoo i, the voodoo ii was a 3d only card, and piggy backed with a 2d video card.
the only video card that can use both glide2 (under xfree86 3.x) and glide3 (under xfree86 4.x) is the voodoo iii.
the svgalib based apple2 and x based xapple2 can emulate any apple ][ variant except for the //gs.
not everyone knows the different types of games that are out there, so in an effort to form a common language that we can all use, i'll run through each game type and provide a very brief history.
a good example would be heavy gear iii or flight gear.
games written in svgalib will only work on linux.
this project is much less far along than libggi itself, but promises to combine dri-level speeds and the stability and security unix users expect.
back then, text adventures were self contained executables on a disk or casette.
directplay gives support for simplified networking for multiplayer gaming.
they've ignored all my attempts at finding out more information, so i have to conclude that mp entertainment is in the same status as tribsoft.
there's another benefit of these scripts: they are easily edited to allow you to provide your own copy of a library.
this is opposed to the x environment which has all sorts of gui things like xterms.
they worked with linux developers, open sourced all their drivers and were hailed as the great hope for linux gaming.
i've tried to keep game specific information in this howto at a minimum.
wine has come a long way, and is capable of emulating many important programs, which is great news for linux users who want this sort of stuff.
linux gets ragged on a lot because we don't have the wealth of games that other platforms have.
voodoo cards voodoo card hardware acceleration only takes place only at 16bpp color and fails silently when starting x in another color depth.
the developers have done a fantastic job of documenting and faqing their application.
it is an excellently written document that gives you step by step information on how to get dri set up correctly on your machine.
system shock (electronic arts, origin) system shock is a classic first person shooter/adventure from 1994, which puts it as a contemporary of doom.
sometimes, a card is hardwired to use a certain irq.
running glxgears will show some gears turning.
since sound is crucial for me, i always compile sound into my kernels.
they simply put you in a cockpit to give you the thrill of piloting a plane.
mip mapping can be used regardless of filtering method (section 7.4.6).
so if your number is, say, about 20 fps slower than a comparable machine, chances are that glxgears is falling back on
you play a character, sometimes more than one, characterized by traits (eg strength, dexterity), skills (eg explosives, basket weaving, mechanics) and properties (levels, cash).
not only did we have the best video cards, but the drivers were all open source.
however, the file is generated from a text file/etc/ld.so.conf which you can edit.
between losing the benchmark wars to the geforce and radeon, their lateness with new cards and high prices, 3dfx lost its market share and didn't have the funds to stay into business.
the interpreter reads data files and provides the gaming interface.
with these types of cards, you need to pass the correct irq and memory access, "i/o port", to the driver.
trilinear filtering eliminates the banding effect that appears between adjacent mip map levels.
as of version 3.1, the directx 8 support is nearly complete, but this may not be the case with older directx versions (are consequently older games).
the nwn library directories have been prepended to the search path, so now the linker can find libmss.so.6 in the "./miles" directory, and also finds the local copy of libsdl first, no longer using the system copy.
you can see i have an irq conflict between the soundcard (soundblaster) and the network card (eth0).
cpu type video card x version average fps compiling mesa and dri modules yourself can increase your fps by 15 fps; quite a performance boost!
compared with agi games, sci adventures have better music support, a more complex engine and loads of bells and whistles.
jzip is very portable; it compiles on all unices, os/2, atari st and dos.
all modern 3d accelerated video cards can do bilinear filtering in hardware with no performance hit.
if you compile your own games, your biggest problem with libraries will either be thatgcc can't find a static library or perhaps the library doesn't exist on your system.
do note that they don't archive private newsgroups, like loki software's news server.
like text adventures, fps fit the engine/datafile format.
it's a clearing house of information that contains well written articles on all aspects of game programming (not necessarily linux specific), links to important game programming resources, interviews, reviews, polls and lots of other stuff.
for open source games there's the readme files that come with the game.
that is, through the eyes of the character who's doing all the shooting.
he was the lead programmer for loki software (he now codes for blizzard software), which used sdl in all of its games except for quake3.
this should let input characters echo again.
dumb engines draw far objects first and close objects last, obscuring objects below them in the z buffer.
the reason why it's not an emulator is subtle and not of much interest to most non computer scientists, so we'll call it an emulator here (it really does run-time translation of calls to the win32 api to posix/x11 calls).
back in the 80's, they were little more than text adventures which showed a screen of static graphics.
check the game's website for patches whether you have a problem running the game or not; there may be an update for a security problem that you may not even be aware of.
getting info about your setup: xvidtune xvidtune is your friend when your x screen is shifted a little bit too far to the right, or if the vertical length is too small to fit on your monitor.
ultima i was released in 1987 and was the game that launched 9 (depending on how you want to count them) very popular sequels, finishing with ultima ix: ascension.
now we can try to locate mind.dat and move it into /usr/share, or better, create a symbolic link.
so to use these two libraries, you would passgcc the -lsdl -lm options.
they wrote many graphical adventures using scumm, like their famous monkey island series (all three).
that is, it'll run windows 16-bit applications from a windows 3.1, windows 3.11 or windows for workgroups 3.11 environment.
in addition to run-time translation of the win32 api to posix/x11 (it runs windows applications on linux), wine also does compile-time tranlation of the win32 api to posix/x11 (it compiles windows application source code on linux).
this is opposed to the x environment which has all sorts of gui things like xterms.
a more relevent issue is speakers, but even here the difference isn't huge.
when a particular graphics task isn't able to be hardware accelerated by the video card, it's software rendered; the task is done by your computer's cpu instead.
moreover, a game writer who uses libraries like opengl, ggi or sdl will write a game which will trivially compile on windows, linux and a multitude of other os's.
however, since it's commercial you do get tech support.
you should hear disk activity.
graphical console games written using the frame buffer suffer from the same deficiencies of the svga library: not all hardware is supported and the code will only run on linux.
misconfigured driver sometimes, a card is hardwired to use a certain irq.
the program responsible for linking code “on the fly” is called/etc/ld.so, and the dynamic libraries themselves usually end with.so with a version number, like: /usr/lib/libsdl.so /lib/
the downside is that you'll have to play the game as root.
it only supports serial and parallel devices.
the version at my personal web site might be broken if i'm working on the howto.
otherwise, all you'll get is software rendering.
a program that is allowed to directly write to hardware can crash the system in any number of ways.
some rpg's are quite complicated and great feats of programming.
the current radeon 9800 barely beats out the geforce 5900 in benchmarks and card specs, but linux users won't benefit from this because of driver issues..
aa uses cpu intensive filtering to smooth out these jagged edges.
first, you pretty much blow up everything you see.
when a computer locks, it can be a "hard lock", meaning the kernel has completely stopped functioning.
most applications that use svgalib can be run on x or any other libggi backend by using a wrapper library which re-implements svgalib (section 3.12) using libggi.
libraries we'll run through the different gaming libraries you'll see under linux.
