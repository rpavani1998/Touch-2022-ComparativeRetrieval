it's counter-intuitive to code, performs worse and lacks features than d3d. major developers (id etc) are using d3d even though they don't like being locked to windows, simply because it is far superior to opengl.

i dare say a number of people here who are saying that they will ditch windows just as soon as they can run games on linux will come crying back to windows within a couple of hours.
for those worried that direct3d 10/11 won't have the same kind of performance as opengl, barbieri said, "finally, a mature direct3d 10/11 implementation is intrinsically going to be faster and more reliable than an opengl implementation, thanks to the dramatically smaller api and the segregation of all nontrivial work to object creation that the application must perform ahead of time.
i haven't really seen any major distribution that looks like windows.
i'm sure you've heard that said ad nauseum, but you obviously still don't understand it.
a special kernel with gallium + x (if needed at all) + drivers for networking/pads/etc and a gui to select the game.
the console manufacturers can't pick anything other than gl or d3d.
that's why wine developers have steered clear of re-implementing the same api features and why it's difficult to get many games working through wine.
so, no, it's not linux native.
it's really a great os, and given the chance, i'm sure it'll run the same apps that windows runs even better.
obviously you are pleased with what you have.
the only reason im still on windows is on my netbook for blackberry manager (for tethering) and main desktop for gaming.
so we'll have windows games running on a ps3 with the kinect device.
while it's better than just having 1, a duopoly is still not very competitive.
people will not just up and leave windows.
in case you missed the link i posted earlier, i'll provide it again: http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/lnw.htm that article is 5-6 years old, and yet amazingly the dead horse still gets beaten to a pulp with the same old arguments from the same people who have no idea about anything outside of their zone of familiarity.
and opengl and directx are really close, from feature and performance point of view.
oh gosh how bad windows is, let`s kill the big bad wolf, they charge us money for the os..

i am currently using linux and hearing this definitely adds hope for the linux community.
microsoft isn't going to just make an api so people can reap it's benefits in linux.
me personally i have no use at all of linux and will never be a part of my os.

(well shoot the clerk that seels you bread at the local store for charing you money for it).
well i don't know much about d3d since i write for linux, but when id etc switch away from the open software they support there must be a major advantage, and i don't think they're selling out to microsoft.
not all linux users have an issue with the price of anything (except that they can fulfil their needs without cost).you can sell linux distros that are freely downloadable and you are not discouraged from doing so.
hide - 8 + ricardok : actually, it's not going to be made by microsoft.

i could be apple all i want to put android on their iphone but that doesn't mean it will happen willgart 09/27/2010 2:43 am hide - 2 + doorspawn : what we need is more competition, a newcomer 3d api (or many of them), designed from scratch.
and i find it extremely funny how linux tries to be a windows, i mean ok let`s dump the command line installers let`s do it more user friendly like windows has, let`s make the menus look more like windows for users to transition with ease, let`s install dx from windows in linux ...
they're still working on the driver side i think.
the thing that linux users never got to understand is that the market has room for bouth of them, and that there are loads of ppl like me that are very pleased with their windows and will never even look at a linux platform.
hey steam i hear linux is more lucrative than ever...if u cant get a hint make steam for linux
also, it will run through wine!!

microsoft works hard with the gaming industry and the vendors, the competition come from the consoles.
the only added cost is to the api designer.
ohim : i mean ok let`s dump the command line installers most distributions do not use a pure command line for installing the base system, but many still use a text-based installer.
you appear to be one of these people, but it's a very big group so don't feel too bad.
the cost associated to develop on a different api is too high.
you could fine tune your pc to a point where you would get monster performance loading exactly what you need from the boot loader.
c'mon man, i am talking about microsoft continuing development with directx. if everyone is just gonna migrate to linux, they will stop developing it.
luca barbieri made a commit with news of native direct3d 10/11 support into gallium, with an eventual goal of running windows games in wine.

after all, windows is a late comer to the gui arena.
the implementation on the other hand may have patentable components.

hide - 5 + opengl is not an excellent cross-platform api, although it may have been one day.
willgart : opengl and directx are really close, from feature and performance point of view.

most games only support 1 right now.
there are alot of arrogant windows fanboys who, firstly, don't have much of an understanding about theirown operating system, and secondly don't have a clue about linux either, but pretend that they do.
you can't create a new 3d api at present unless you implement a translation layer to either gl or d3d. it'd be like trying to write a new language or even a new compiler if the x86 spec was secret.
how bad windows is, let`s kill the big bad wolf, they charge us money for the os..
i don't know script commands, and trying to install anything on linux without an active internet connection is just not going to happen
it will run through wine, so
game devs etc can only have things either as good (stick with gl and/or d3d) or better (a new api becomes better than those two).
the windows guys accept the linux guys with ease and look at them with indifference .. but the linux looks so full of itself ..

linux is not windows, and requires a different way of thinking and doing things.
a closer look at dell's 7-inch tablet - nvidia gpus used for serious business.
graphics cards are getting flexible enough you can almost program a fast rendering engine yourself instead of using the standard rendering pathway.
or look we are bright enough that we can install a program trough command line in linux ... seriously ..
cheers! freiheitner 09/27/2010 12:11 pm hide - 1 + "not on linux until this week" -- except that it's still not released and wine has been trying to run windows apps on linux for something like 12 years and, as far as i am aware, they still aren't 100% compatible apps written for the initial windows 95 release much less directx 11.
doorspawn 09/27/2010 5:15 am hide - 1 + willgart : the cost associated to develop on a different api is too high.

let`s do it more user friendly like windows has "user friendly" is a term used interchangeably with "what i'm used to" and therefore windows is only user friendly because it is what you are used to.
most of gaming consoles use opengl, developers just need to improve linux video card drivers ricardok 09/26/2010 10:30 pm hide - 0 + mlopinto2k1 : microsoft isn't going to just make an api so people can reap it's benefits in linux.
