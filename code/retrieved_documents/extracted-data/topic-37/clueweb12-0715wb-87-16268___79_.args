it is an essential resource for the scientists, engineers, researchers, and developers who rely on gpus to tackle enormous computational challenges.they also allow for faster and easier global collaboration and communication, ensure better visibility and visualization of early stage products.this "push-button" rendering capability can dramatically improve artist productivity in a wide variety of use cases, including architectural visualization, automotive styling and marketing, product styling, among others.research has proven that only 35% of students can think in 3d, so visualization has become an important tool in the classroom for improving engagement, comprehension and boosting test scores.the xulu platform scales gracefully for a large number of simultaneous users with minimal reliance on centralized servers, and harnesses the power of leading-edge gpus and cpus to deliver ultimate online end-user experiences.this breakthrough technology immediately provides users with the ability to implement tasks that were traditionally addressed only with massive supercomputers or that were simply unsolvable.this new technology is valuable for anyone wanting to build a high-performance, ray tracing renderer (interactive or off-line), accelerate an existing ray tracing renderer, add raytrace capabilities to raster renderers, or even perform generic ray tracing functions for computation.research has proven that only 35% of students can think in 3d, so visualization has become an important tool in the classroom for improving engagement, comprehension and boosting test scores. ...the unity tools have been hailed as revolutionary for enabling high quality results in an easily accessible development environment.the newly available computational power brought by gpus is enabling a new generation of scientific and engineering applications to perform calculations on "personal supercomputers" that previously required hpc clusters or that were otherwise impractical in everyday use.the ability to bring supercomputing to the data, in form of nvidia gpus, however, allows high-throughput analysis where results can be obtained fast enough to guide subsequent experiments.many of these new programmers have pursued cuda development without any prior exposure to opengl or experience with graphics programming, but nonetheless could benefit from the powerful visualization capabilities gpus also have to offer.express connect delivers unprecedented rack-level scalability, with i/o and server resources that can be scaled independently for 50-70% savings in capital, power, and cooling.it offers new opportunities for collaboration among chinese designers, engineers, and other cad users.the gpu (graphics processing unit) runs advanced applications which are transforming existing industries and creating new ones.
