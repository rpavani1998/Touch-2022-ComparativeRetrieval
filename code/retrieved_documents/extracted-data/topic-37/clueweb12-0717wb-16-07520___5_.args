this is a core asset of the gnome platform since it encourage our so beloved freedom of choice.basically it allows you to show opengl accelerated graphics of applications running in a virtualized guest os like linux.i'm starting to seriously believe that this kind of progress on the virtualization space is going to change we think about applications, operating systems and even debugging.it seems that gtk 2.12 is going to include the gtkbuilder api that johan has been developing for a while, this is going to allow to abtract a lot of details, it not only replace libglade and uimanager, but also, it will be possible to define treeview columns and even populate data on it from a ui designer, such designer doesn't exist yet, this ui is yet to be created, but again, time will fix this.alexander larsson is working on gvfs, a new api for accessing files and perform io operations, that whips gnome-vfs' ass in terms of simplicity and portability.almost native performance and concurrent execution of various games like quake3 or unreal.the results of the benchmarks are just impressive.we have the wider and best maintained set of bindings for a graphical toolkit, just take a look at the development activity inpygtk, ruby-gnome, java-gnome, gtkmm.. (the list goes on).work keeps me busy enough to being unable to accomplish the promise i made myself to release a gtk+ msi installer before guadec.when i started to getting involved with gnome, i missed some features and got frustrated on how many details i needed to know to solve simple problems.you can check the software available on the repositoryhere.on the other hand i realized today via footnotes, that anjuta 2.2, the first stable release of the 2.x series has been released, congratulations to the developers.the saddest thing is that it was intentional, someone did it, someone wanted this to happen.there is also another forest fire on tenerife, the authorities suspect that it's also intentional.if you are looking for an easy hack, metacity and gtk themes variants of the app would be really cool.
