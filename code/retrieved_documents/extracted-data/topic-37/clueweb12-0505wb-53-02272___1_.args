directx provides a standard, robust platform to application developers, by guaranteeing hardware independence.direct3d is available to the developer as an api, using which, applications utilizing 3d graphics can be developed much faster using a standard way.this api gives hardware independence in addition to transparent hardware acceleration and a fast software based emulation for missing hardware implementations of the rendering pipeline.by providing a consistent interface across all hardware platforms, taking care of incompatibilities is shifted away from the application developer, resulting in less code and hence faster development.for developing these applications, direct3d provides the following features: device independence - helps shield the applications from the vagaries of the different hardware platforms.in addition to these features, direct3d provides a fast software based rendering of the full 3d rendering pipeline.applications developed using direct3d are scalable as a part or whole of the 3d rendering pipeline can be in the hardware and direct3d can make use of it, if it is detected.additionally, the time spent in developing such well known and well defined techniques is saved, helping in developing applications faster transparent access to hardware acceleration - is one of the very important features of direct3d, which uses the hardware support, if available.all these features help in drastically improving the performance of the windows applications as compared to windows applications written without such support.hardware independence is guaranteed by directx, by providing requirement guidelines to all hardware vendors.applications using these features will see a boost in performance eases addition of 3d to applications - as direct3d provides a standard mechanism and a standard set of algorithms for 3d graphics, applications requiring such features can be developed much faster.due to this, the complexity of software development is reduced and the incompatibilities between the hardware platforms is neutralized as far as possible.an advantage of this model over the rgb model is that it gives better performance than the rgb model.all of the features of direct3d are built on top of the hal, which provides hardware independence and makes applications portable.the primary motivation for developing these libraries is that the performance of existing windows applications catering to graphics intensive application like games and multimedia is very poor in comparison to the same applications developed on dos.
