the cost associated to develop on a different api is too high.
so you and the other 5 people that suffer through linux gaming can hurry up and download it?
the only added cost is to the api designer.
that's why wine developers have steered clear of re-implementing the same api features and why it's difficult to get many games working through wine.
let`s do it more user friendly like windows has "user friendly" is a term used interchangeably with "what i'm used to" and therefore windows is only user friendly because it is what you are used to.
game devs etc can only have things either as good (stick with gl and/or d3d) or better (a new api becomes better than those two).

"the primary goal is to realize gallium's promise of multiple api  support, and provide an api that can be easily implemented with just a very  thin wrapper over gallium, instead of the enormous amount of complex code  needed for opengl," wrote barbieri.
he added, "thanks to a very clean and well-though design done from scratch, the direct3d 10/11 apis are vastly better than opengl and can be supported with orders of magnitude less code and development time, as you can see by comparing the lines of code of this commit and those in the existing mesa opengl implementation."
they do "support it", it's the other way around actually.
opengl has had slack periods recently (eg the 3.0 debacle where they dragged on forever then deleted most of the improvements developers were waiting on).
obviously you are pleased with what you have.

i am currently using linux and hearing this definitely adds hope for the linux community.

a special kernel with gallium + x (if needed at all) + drivers for networking/pads/etc and a gui to select the game.
they're still working on the driver side i think.
well i don't know much about d3d since i write for linux, but when id etc switch away from the open software they support there must be a major advantage, and i don't think they're selling out to microsoft.
then why on earth are you trying to make an argument about linux or linux users if you've never even looked at it?
you've never used anything else to know if you're using the right tool for the job (oss are just tools after all, and you should always use the best tool for you, not for someone else)

it's counter-intuitive to code, performs worse and lacks features than d3d. major developers (id etc) are using d3d even though they don't like being locked to windows, simply because it is far superior to opengl.
nobody's forcing you to support all compatible apis.
the thing that linux users never got to understand is that the market has room for bouth of them, and that there are loads of ppl like me that are very pleased with their windows and will never even look at a linux platform.

the windows guys accept the linux guys with ease and look at them with indifference i beg to differ, and i'm a "windows guy" (actually i use and appreciate both, but use windows more often at the moment)
but even if there was one, how at all does this represent the goals of "linux" (which is, at its most broad definition, simply the kernel and gnu toolchain).
ever tried arch linux?
you can't create a new 3d api at present unless you implement a translation layer to either gl or d3d. it'd be like trying to write a new language or even a new compiler if the x86 spec was secret.

in case you missed the link i posted earlier, i'll provide it again: http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/lnw.htm that article is 5-6 years old, and yet amazingly the dead horse still gets beaten to a pulp with the same old arguments from the same people who have no idea about anything outside of their zone of familiarity.
see now this is a very common statement by somebody who doesn't understand the concept of libre software.
not all linux users have an issue with the price of anything (except that they can fulfil their needs without cost).you can sell linux distros that are freely downloadable and you are not discouraged from doing so.

a 90-year-old woman in a nursing home?
and for all of us that don't use ms, it's been a monopoly.
which user do you refer to when you say "user friendly"?
why aren't we breaking down doors and writing laws forcing these companies to release their api specs so we can write better software for them?
but that'd require hardware vendors to open their apis.
