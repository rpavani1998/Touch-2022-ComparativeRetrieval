populating this is a matter of reading through the layer elements of the returned xml and adding layers to a collection which is then bound to the tree view’s itemssource property.
you could use binding, but i needed to add some events solistboxitems are added in code behind.
finally the resulting route is plotted in the silverlight map ui.
the other planets and moons have somewhat less data available, but still benefit from the xna treatment.
waypoint limit work around: an interesting side note to routeoptimization service is the ability to extend the number of waypoints.
i was privileged to spend a few days at foss4g in denver.
xna involves tessellated models, rendering pipelines, vertex shaders, pixel shaders, and a high level shading language, hlsl, accompanied by the usual linear algebra suspects.
one simplification that makes this much easier is to ignore routing momentarily and use a shortest distance algorithm to make a first route optimization pass.
bing route service does not attempt to reorder waypoints for optimal routing.
proliferating conspiracy theories only corroborate neil postman’s shuffled deck analogy, that a disintegrating information context conditions perception to credulity.
no more recursive controls beyond this border.
the microsoft option has only been possible in the last year or so with the introduction of sql server 2008 and bing maps silverlight map control.
as a wcf service, routeoptimization can take latitude, longitude point sets from any source and return the ordered points for display in any web ui.
since the original cloud model is not real cloud coverage, it is usually not an asset to nasa neo data.
similar things can be done with svg, and will be as html5 increases its reach, and probably even in kml for the googler minded.
however, with the ability to order waypoints with an outside service this limit has a work around.
the core technology of our current cultural turnover is electronics and the key utility is “ information,” its storage and flow.
so i’ve brushed off code from a previous post,nasa neo 3d xna, and adapted it for planetary data, minus the population bump map.
the best way to get started is to borrow from the experts.
“for the web to move forward and for consumers to get the most out of touch-first browsing, the metro style browser in windows 8 is as html5-only as possible, and plug-in free.
i added the store items along with aisles and shelf polygon id to a table accessed through a wcf query.
even though census data releases are a year or so after the actual census, it was several more years before the census bureau started investigating alternative wms services for distributing data.
after all, look at the way mobile touch, voice, inertia, gyro, accelerometer, gps . . .
unintended messages ripple across unknowable communities, and histories, whether wanted or unwanted, retain regrettably long tails.
naturally web maps can be quitebeautiful, whatever that means subjectively.
doubtless a few stray stalinist atduke and zuccotti park are taking notes on new media and the social web.
once this leaflet bing extension javascript is referenced into a page, adding bing map styles is simply a matter of adding l.tilelayer.
microsoft includes some rich sample code as part of the kinect sdk download.
however, this brings us to problem 2 it turns out that there are a couple of assemblies that are missing from azure’s os but required for our silverlight membership businessapplication.
route segments between waypoints are optimized, but waypoints themselves are up to the user.
at least they are not introduced with full fledged coverage.
“technology solved the problem of information scarcity, the disadvantages of which were obvious.
“the great communication that we have today can lead to complete depersonalization.
in a state of information overload, the key to riches is meaningful information reduction.
visual studio 2010 adds a cloud toolkit with template ready services (not to be confused with “shovel ready”).
for dense point sources a heat map raster overview would be best at the top of the pyramid.
this way rural area of interest can gain the benefit of vectors higher in the pyramid than would be useful in urban areas.
i wrote a proxy wcf service to grab the image and then write it to png even if the source is jpeg.
real human relationships have deeper currents than high velocity information or spatial attribution.
i had hoped to show a stack of floor plans at an oblique view with an animation for the selected floor plan sliding it out of the stack and rotating to planar view.
the stuff in this case is not roads, addresses, and shops, but smaller stuff, human scale stuff that we use in our everyday consumer and corporate lives.
time may be chunky in mirror land, but with immediate mode xna it does move, clicking through the present moment one frame at a time.
copy webrole1 webrole.cs to businessapplication1.web and correct namespace step 3 cloudservice1 roles right click to add role in solution – businessapplication.
fig 5 – part of normal map from asu moon color relief imagery the result is seen in the moonviewer client with the added benefit of immediate mode gpu rendering that allows smooth rotation and zoom.
xna involves tessellated models, rendering pipelines, vertex shaders, pixel shaders, and a high level shading language, hlsl, accompanied by the usual linear algebra suspects.
the treeview control comes from the silverlight toolkit project.
in wpf it was always interesting to put a video element over the scene model, but i doubt that will work here in xna.
step 3 – do something simple with the floorplans some useful utilities included nesting my floorplan xaml inside a which is coded to implement some normal pan and zoom functions: pan with left mouse, double click zoom in, and mouse wheel zoom +/-.
xaml’s retained mode graphics lacks a sense of time’s flow.
wpf has had 3d mesh capability for a few years, but sl5 will add the same camera level control in 3d scene graphs to spice up delivery in the browser.
first i wrote a small webapp that allows me to zoom bing maps aerial to a desired building and draw a polyline around its footprint.
in an intermediate situation with data that changes slowly, static tiles are still an option using a pre-seeding batch process run at some scheduled interval.
in a different vein, the next release of postgis will push raster analysis right into sql.
you may have to download some additional software as well as the kinect sdk: finally, we are making use of port 4530 for the socket service.
but it gave no warnings about the danger of information glut, the disadvantages of which were not seen so clearly, the long range result – information chaos.”
however, the real goal is playing with interior plans and i left the data connector feature for a future enhancement.
yes, there are tropical white sands by an azure sea, but the heart of darkness presses in on the mind.
fig 4 – solar wind sl5 xna sample this is my starting point.
the static example is a little different from other approaches i’ve used, such as geowebcache, since it drops tiles into sql server as they are created rather than using a file system pyramid.
layers doesn’t work consistently in the mobile browsers i tested.
it’s nice to have an alpha channel for some types of visualization.
since gestureviewer toolbox includes a learning template based gesture module, you can capture just about any gesture desired.
the answer is obvious, get a building plan and start trying a few things.
the first task is to read the neo getcapabilities xml and produce the treeview control to manage such a wealth of data.
our web mapping subset of technology is embedded in thisinformation ramp up, and we are still grappling with the confusion ofinformation and knowledge, resulting from an accelerating information glut.
taking the longer view, however, can be a useful exercise.
the difficulty for an xna novice like myself is understanding the hlsl files and coming to terms with the rendering pipeline.
eventually i’ll have a chance to revisit this in sl5 with its full 3d scene graph support.
this is where route optimization comes in handy.
naturally web maps can be quitebeautiful, whatever that means subjectively.
nasa neo conveniently publishes 45 categories and 129 layers of a variety of global data collected on a regular basis.
since the first time i saw leaflet i’ve been intrigued with its elegance and the potential for abstracting away some of the issues surrounding web apps targeted at mobile and touch clients.
http://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/labels/mapserver/export 2) wms getfeatureinfo requests can provide information from the polygon stack, but the lack of a cross-domain policy file on thetigerweb wms server means that a pass through proxy service needs to be hosted on the same server as the leaflet web app.
sol sadly died before seeing his legacy, but what a legacy.
for symmetry sake xbox should have silverlight as apparently announcedhere.
using power scaling at pushpin levels allows higher density pins to show higher in the pyramid without as much clutter.
fme does have an svg writer.
once read, the command can then be translated into appropriate actions for our map controller.
enduring histories on facebook, subject to examination by iranian intelligence for hardly promising ends, should be unsettling to all but the grimmest of marxist utopians.
above is silverlight xaml with the beauty of recursive hierarchies and below is all xna with its rendering pipeline plumbing.
however, tigerweb wms service is a wide open door for standards based javascript libraries.
the map control side of gesture commands could also benefit from someeasing function animations.
since i’m fond ofbing silverlight map control, the goal is dwg to xaml.
i had kept the dwg limited to simple closed polylines and text, separated by layer names.
very high – for very high feature counts at low zoomlevels near the top of the pyramid i’d just turn off the layer.
summary census bureau’s new tigerweb is a great step forward for users of tiger data.
some perspective: the gis nervous system grows connections around the world faster than a three year old’s brain.
taking the longer view, however, can be a useful exercise.
adding an ogc wfs service would be the ideal, but wfs always has problems with potentially very large result sets, so i’m not sure this is practical on a public ogc service.
this bare bones censustest project took only a few hours over the weekend to write using leaflet.
it won’t be too long until we see these devices in every corner of rooms supplementing the omnipresent security cameras with 3d views.
this is a big step for mirror land.
this is the year of wps, web processing service, and the hope of constructing webs of analysis chains from disparate nodes.
leaflet the bing javascript extension seemed to run into a problem with intersect at this line: if (zoom = coverage.zoommin && coverage.bbox.intersects(bounds)) removing the intersect(bounds) clause seemed to get things working without noticeable problems: if (zoom = coverage.zoommin )
bit obsession is now woven into western economic fabric with the assumption of continuous progress.
the javascript platform is a growth industry with the help of backend tools likenode.js, html5 websockets, and asynchronous webworkers.
it’s quite the opportunity to have an international convergence of gis developers handily just a bus ride up the highway.
the age of typography, ushered into western culture by gutenberg, had profound and enduring effects on history and culture, affecting everything – from the reformation and the rise of democratic nationalism to our educational bureaucracy and even common definitions of truth and knowledge.
the obvious direction is a poor man’s 3d modeler.
it even illustrates the use of a normal (bump) map for 3d effects on the surface without needing a tessellated surface terrain model.
web mapping is one more filtering approach reducing information along the axis of spatial proximity.
or uav add a bit of uav and we can move mirror land from the 30cm (1 foot) resolution capture soon to be added to bing maps (seeblaise aguera y arcas comments) to hmmm what looks like sub centimeter.
using mouse and arrow keys allows the camera/avatar to move through the virtual environment colliding with walls etc.
doesn’t it seem peculiar, for example, to attach any meaning whatsoever to charts of kindergartener’sdibels scores, let alone median dibels scores charted on national school district polygons.
adding a bing maps layer with leaflet is possible usinghttps://gist.github.com/1221998.
if that can be worked out the logical next step is grabbing dem data from usgs for generating ground level terrain models.
xna is closer to the gpu with the time tested graphics rendering pipeline familiar to direct3d/opengl developers, but not so familiar to xaml developers.
i will need to replace the cloud pixel image with something benign to take advantage of the proper lighting setup for daytime.
now we can add a diagnosticmonitor and trace logging to the webrole.cs step 5 open businessapplication1.web web.config, add connection string pointed at sql azure aspnetdb and a set of applicationservices:     .database.windows.net;database=aspnetdb;user
two hand vector controlling for 3d scenes is also promising and integrates very well with sl5 xna immediate mode graphics.
unfortunately, kinect and the web aren’t exactly ideal partners.
mirror land is still caught in 2-3d. the upcoming silverlight 5 release will boost things toward the 3-4d. multi-verse theories aside (now here’s a taxonomy to ponder – the tegmark cosmological taxonomy of universes), in the 3-4d range full webbim can hit the streets.
web (optional remove webrole1 from roles and remove webrole project since it is no longer needed) step 4 add a diagnosticsconnectionstring property to the roles/businessapplication1.web role that points to the azure blob storage.
with the release of an officialmicrosoft kinect beta sdk for windows, things get even more interesting.
however, there doesn’t seem to be a wms layer for labels like those on the tigerweb viewer.
from a silverlight xaml perspective, mirror land is largely a static machine with infrequent events triggered by users.
anytime you run across register references you know this is getting closer to hardware.
apparently, sl5 xna can make a compelling interactive museum, refinery, nuclear facility, or walmart browser.
for one thing too many points clutter a map, while their simplicity means that more point vectors can be rendered before affecting ui performance.
this is a “lightweight” js map library that works well with jquery and abstracts away some of the complexity of supporting a fragmenting mobile browser world.
summary: this small exercise will likely irk true nbimsers who will not see much “real” bim in a few floor plans.
next step can’t miss the augmented reality angle.
a xaml canvas containing the floor plans would be stored in a blob column for easy query and import to the ui.
in xna it seems getting a point on the earth to trigger a location event requires some manner of collision or ray.intersects(plane).
byzantine bureaucracy has been around since … well the byzantine empire, and given human nature is likely enduring.
turning this off and deferring to the bing maps logo frees up more screen space which is at a premium on mobile devices.
in addition there are a couple of very helpful blog posts bydavid catuhe and a codeplex project, kinect toolbox.
aaron oneal has been very kind to post some nicesamples including a game engine called babylon written by david catuhe.
as bim grows the isolated bim models start to aggregate and bump up against the floor of web mapping, the big ‘mirror land’.

as gestures are detected they are pushed out to local port 4530 on a tcp socket service.
on the enterprise side, behind locked bim doors, silverlight with its rich authentication framework, but more limited mobile reach, will play a part in proprietary asset management which is a big part of fm, bm, bim …..
although of relatively recent origins, bim has already spawned its own bureaucratic industry with the likes ofnbims replete with committees, charters, and governance capable of seriously publishing paragraphs like this:“nbim standards will merge data interoperability standards, content values and taxonomies, and process definitions to create standards which define “business views” of information needed to accomplish a particular set of functions as well as the information exchange standards between stakeholders.”

conclusion: a hybrid zoom level based approach is the best general architecture for silverlight web maps where large data sets are involved.
the approach for using kinect for this experimental map interface is to use the gestureviewer code from kinect toolbox to capture some primitive commands arising from sensory input.

it sounds like an expensive operation but surprisingly this re-instantiation seems to take less time than receiving the getmap request from the wms service.
route savvy is primarily a service to which any number of uis can connect and silverlight happens to be a nice way to create useful uis.
however, there doesn’t seem to be a wms layer for labels like those on the tigerweb viewer.
no child is better off for the graph (unless distant employment potential as an educational bureaucrat is considered relevant), and, “no child left behind” slogans to the contrary, the overthrow of typography based education proceeds apace in a confusing melee of winners and losers.

another avenue of investigation would be some type of pointer intersection using a ray to indicate planet surface locations for events.
this is added to the xna rendering pipeline to combine a surface texture with the color relief imagery, where it can then be applied to a simplified spherical model.

by recursively re–ordering nodes to eliminate segment intersects, the computer quickly turns the above node set into this: the nodes are first ordered with the simplified assumption of straight line segment connectors, and only after a re-ordering is the usual bing route service triggered to get actual routes between nodes.
having available a heat map overview, for example, could provide a quick viewport density calculation based on a pixel sum of the heat map intersecting with the user’s viewport.
aec generates floorplans by the boatload and there are even some available on line, but lacking dwg files the next possibility is using cad as a capture tool.
