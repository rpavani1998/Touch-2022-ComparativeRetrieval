this reduces the utility of open source software, which almost universally is unable to take advantage of this kind of system due to protection measures that typically require signed trusted code.dx11 is a bit ahead of ogl in hardware requirements/capabilities, so full support for dx11 means it has everything ogl needs also.even with the optimization intel has put into this, they'll be more than an order of magnitude of graphics performance behind the dedicated solutions of their competitors.those new texture mapping algorithms will really make outlook load fast.none of these chips execute 'direct3d' or 'opengl' directly, they remap the functions to an internal 3d api.opengl programmers are always ahead of directx, even in this case where the hardware directly targets future directx specs.though i'm more concerned on what this will do to the future of directx. wh opengl has to please a large group with more uses than just games; it is done with input from the wide range of developers that use it.that said, boycotting closed media is likely to be just as effective as boycotting hardware that supports it; probably more so, as it is somewhat more direct.its worth noting that linux now has a long tradition with intel at receiving support first because the code base is readily available for development, experimentation, and testing.any software, such as opengl, can (and does) tap into the more well chosen of those abstractions.that graphics card has all the hardware necessary to support the directx 11 api.it just allows some new drm'ed protocol to be developed; one that only works on recent intel processors.performance comparable to the lesser nvidia and amd chips, e.g., amd 5400 series, nvidia 410 and 420 (possibly 430) series, is not considered slow by anyone except high end gamers.well, considering dx11 has been out for a while and has been generally tested for bugs already - the idea is that you won't have a bug if it's in the hardware - theres no where for the variables to change values based on a different cpu build or other factors if the calculations are specifically designed to run on that piece of hardware.a better graphics card, or better graphics driver, will render minecraft better.
