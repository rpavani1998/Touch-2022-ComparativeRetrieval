a lot of people in the games industry think licensing is great, since it makes it possible to focus on the game content rather than the technology, and it also makes it possible to drive down the amount of money, staff and time needed to finish a game.even though most modern 3d engines are written on top of a 3d api like opengl, glide or direct3d, they are considered to be very advanced, and therefore many game developers choose to license engines from other companies rather than developing their own engine.low-level 3d rendering apis lowlevel 3d rendering apis exist to give programmers a standardized hardware-independent way of rendering 3d graphics.the apis free the programmer from the burden of learning how to program individual hardware devices on a very low (register) level, and let him/her concentrate on the application.due to the value of a 3d engine in the games market, licensing a commercial 3d game engine has become too expensive for people who are interested in other applications less profitable than games.such data cannot be edited by hand, it needs special tools in order to be manipulated, so the storing the data in a human-readable file format is of limited interest.for the gaming industry this is a new way to prolong the life time of games, since once you have finished a game you can download extensions and levels from the internet.the apis free the programmer from the burden of learning how to program individual hardware devices on a very low (register) level, and let him/herwe will for our development probably use opengl, because of its wide availability on multiple platforms, its high performance and ease of use, and the fact that is supports hardware acceleration of not just the rasterization but also some of the geometry processing (on good hardware, that is:).this simplifies implementing security policies, and makes world persistance easier to achieve.we see a clear advantage in limiting the geometry moduling to just simple triangles and quads, since that lessens the burden on implementors of renderers for the system a great deal.there are non-commercial 3d engines available too, but they are rarely used because of the lack of documentation and tools needed to create data for them.often, the api is accelerated (partly or in whole) by being implemented in dedicated 3d hardware.fahrenheit will introduce a new low-level rendering api, fll, which will replace direct3d, but will sit next to opengl which will continue to be developed.much time has been spent to make shore that the verse data set gives the 3d engine programer freedom to program any way they see fit, but at the same time open for optimizations.
