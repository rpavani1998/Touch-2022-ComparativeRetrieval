transformations work for hardware accelerated bitmap drawing (including fonts) but the software component is not implemented as of yet.when destroying a display its bitmaps will be managed properly, e.g. converted to memory bitmaps if necessary.this can cause problems and also will override user config.without this, custom vertices either resulted in warnings or outright crashes on some systems.this is a simple permissive free software licence, close in spirit to the 'giftware' licence, but is clearer and more well-known.we have an event system, a new keyboard api, a new joystick api, a new timer api, and the start of a new graphics api.mouse events now reflect system cursor movements even in fullscreen mode.improved compile times and dll sizes by simplifying "memblit" functions.now both transformation and current blending mode are stored in the display but provisions are made for them to also work if the current thread has no display.this allows unsetting fullscreen modes in the x11 driver.if it's easy to maintain compatibility then we do it, otherwise compatibility is dropped.this solves the problem of running out of resources if you set many different target bitmaps.graphics: save memory in opengl case by freeing bitmap memory after uploading a texture.removed opengl state saving code, it was causing massive slowdown when drawing.opengl driver now respects the 'linear' texture filtering configuration option.
