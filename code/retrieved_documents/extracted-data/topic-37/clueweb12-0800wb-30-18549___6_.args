this is a core asset of the gnome platform since it encourage our so beloved freedom of choice.the easier people is able to adapt opensolaris for their needs, the most problems it solves, and the most adoption it gets.basically it allows you to show opengl accelerated graphics of applications running in a virtualized guest os like linux.i'm starting to seriously believe that this kind of progress on the virtualization space is going to change we think about applications, operating systems and even debugging.it seems that gtk 2.12 is going to include the gtkbuilder api that johan has been developing for a while, this is going to allow to abtract a lot of details, it not only replace libglade and uimanager, but also, it will be possible to define treeview columns and even populate data on it from a ui designer, such designer doesn't exist yet, this ui is yet to be created, but again, time will fix this.alexander larsson is working on gvfs, a new api for accessing files and perform io operations, that whips gnome-vfs' ass in terms of simplicity and portability.this excites me because i would like to see the days when hostility between opensolaris and the linux community is over (at the same time i also think that the gplv3 would be a huge step), but at the same time, making people from the most adopted unix-like operating system out there comfortable on opensolaris would be a huge step (for both projects and the whole free software community).there are also people complaining about having too many distributions would be harmful for opensolaris because people wouldn't know which one to choose.almost native performance and concurrent execution of various games like quake3 or unreal.but a nice text help when you use "top" trying to help users to gather the same information they expect (something like what ubuntu does now when you type a missing command) would help a lot of people.the results of the benchmarks are just impressive.we have the wider and best maintained set of bindings for a graphical toolkit, just take a look at the development activity inpygtk, ruby-gnome, java-gnome, gtkmm.. (the list goes on).the reason because i think this is because i'm a strongly community guy, and i do think that a good healthy and friendly community is the most important assent to any free software project.the personal side work keeps me busy enough to being unable to accomplish the promise i made myself to release a gtk+ msi installer before guadec.this is the first time that i do any kind of computer animation, and given the fact that my c skills are not any extraordinary, and that i did this hack in 1 hour (most of the time looking at others .h
